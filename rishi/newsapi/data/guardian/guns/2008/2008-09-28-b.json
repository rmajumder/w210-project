  "<p>British troops who hand over prisoners in Iraq to US military personnel could find themselves facing prosecution, according to a legal opinion compiled for parliament. The finding has led to calls for the British government to rethink its current policy and investigate how the US treats its prisoners, and whether torture is employed against them.</p> <p>Earlier this year the all-party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition sought legal opinion from Michael Fordham QC on whether a human rights violation would arise under the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and the 1998 Human Rights Act (HRA) if an individual in British detention in Iraq were handed over to US military personnel, \"despite substantial grounds for considering that there is a real risk of that person being subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment\".</p> <p>The conclusion reached by Fordham and his colleague Tom Hickman is that an offence would definitely have been committed. If acted on, the opinion could mean that UK troops would not be allowed to \"render\" detainees to the US military until it was clear that they would no longer face the possibility of torture or ill-treatment. </p> <p>What prompted the inquiry was a statement made in February this year by Ben Griffin, a former SAS soldier who was on active service in Iraq. In his statement, Griffin said that he was \"in no doubt\" that individuals handed over to the US military \"would be tortured\". He cited what had happened to those detained at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Bagram airbase and Abu Ghraib prison. </p> <p>The opinion adds: \"UK forces operating in Iraq are potentially also subject to UK criminal law, tort law and Iraqi law. Notably, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it a criminal offence for a public official, whatever his nationality and wherever located, to commit an act of torture.\"</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee which commissioned the report, said there had been a number of allegations that UK forces had been capturing people and handing them over to US authorities, knowing that these detainees were at risk of being tortured or mistreated.</p> <p>\"I commissioned a legal opinion to establish whether the UK acted unlawfully when they were handed over,\" said Tyrie. \"I now have the answer. The UK remains legally responsible for the subsequent treatment of anybody who has been detained by the UK. It is likely that British policy on this area is not only ethically questionable but is also unlawful. The government now needs to radically rethink its policy on this issue.\"</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, director of the legal action charity Reprieve, also welcomed the findings. \"We are delighted that the all-party parliamentary group has recognised the illegality of British troops handing over prisoners to US custody in Iraq, \" he said. \"These prisoners promptly disappear into an unaccountable prison network in which over 20,000 prisoners are held for illegal interrogation and torture. If it is confirmed that this has been happening, the British government must immediately reveal how many people have been handed over, where they are now, and what has been done to them.\"</p> <p>Paul Marsh, president of the Law Society, called on the government to investigate what happens to prisoners rendered from British custody. \"Extraordinary rendition has been used by some states as a means of bypassing the formal justice system,\" said Marsh. \"To do so is a breach of the rule of law and puts individuals at risk of ill-treatment. The Law Society calls on the UK government to look beyond assurances from other countries and positively investigate and monitor whether individuals rendered from British custody are receiving equivalent standards of due process. It is time we returned to our values in the rule of law.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/sis-home-welcome.html\">MI6</a> is using the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/socialnetworking\">social networking</a> site <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/facebook\">Facebook</a> to recruit the next generation of spies. The Secret Intelligence Service, which has traditionally scoured the country's elite universities for recruits, launched a series of online adverts this month as part of its attempts to attract people from a variety of backgrounds.</p> <p>\"A number of public channels are used to promote job opportunities in the organisation and Facebook is a recent example of this,\" said a Foreign Office spokeswoman. MI6 runs agents in foreign countries and says it wants its officers to \"reflect the society\" they serve. </p> <p>Before 2006 most recruits joined after getting a tap on the shoulder while studying at a leading university. </p> <p>But since then the organisation has run newspaper and radio adverts. Those on Facebook have already generated a lot of interest. \"There has been a very good response so far,\" said a spokeswoman.</p> <p>The three adverts pop up as users of the social networking site contact each other. One, aimed at those with a university background, reads: \"Graduates of all ages can develop long-term careers as operational officers, collecting and analysing global intelligence.\"</p> <p>Another is targeted at those who are bored with their jobs. \"Time for a career change? MI6 can use your skills. Join us as an operational officer collecting and analysing global intelligence to protect the UK.\"</p> <p>The final advert offers potential applicants an influential place in global history. It says: \"A career in world events? Help influence world events, protect the UK. Operational officer roles collecting and analysing global intelligence.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Jeremy Paxman told Geoff Hoon on air last week that he was being shuffled out of his job as Labour chief whip, it was a vintage, politician-mauling, Newsnight moment. But for some time, there have been mutterings that the programme is performing below-par - and those defining run-ins are too thin on the ground. </p> <p>In fact it was Paxman who kick-started the debate a year ago, when he used his MacTaggart lecture at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival to highlight the plight of the programme he has worked on for nearly 20 years. Newsnight was being undermined by budget cuts of 15%, he said, with a further 20% cut by 2010.\"We have lost producers, researchers and reporters. Nor can we make the films we once made. It is unsustainable and I cannot see how the programme can survive in anything like its current form.\"</p> <p>His audience may have gasped - but as Paxman has privately acknowledged, his speech had no effect and cuts have continued. In addition, the programme's editor, Peter Barron, who brought a modern, mischievous streak, left last month to join Google. The search is on for his successor, and an appointment is expected by the end of next month. The question is: what will he or she inherit?</p> <p>While Paxman remains silent, sources say his opinion is unchanged: Newsnight's lifeblood is draining away, and it continues to be erratic. Embarrassing technical glitches are also being blamed on cutbacks - last Monday, as he came off air he once again snorted \"bloody shambles\". </p> <p>It is not, however, that simple. The audience - of which 40% are over 65, and 55% are male and upmarket - is not only bearing up, but gently rising. There is no shortage of huge news stories for Newsnight to tackle, and some think the programme is dealing with them very well. </p> <p>\"Newsnight is having a very good period, helped by the riveting nature of recent news flow,\" says the former BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies. \"Its coverage of the financial crisis has been good, and its output on Gordon Brown's political problems has been fair and compelling. If Paxman is not the best current affairs interviewer on television, he is certainly up there with the very best. Michael Crick has picked up the political role very successfully. I have not noticed any drop in quality since the cuts were announced.\"</p> <p>But while David Kermode, the editor of Five news, is largely complimentary - \"I watch it. I enjoy it. I regard it as a luxury item. If I'm not interested in their big story of the night I switch off\" - other competitors are less so. Dorothy Byrne, Channel 4's controller of news and current affairs, is with Paxman. </p> <p>\"I no longer see it as a rival,\" she says. \"The programme is insufficiently newsy; it needs more news, it needs more current affairs - more proper foreign affairs films in particular. And less gassing. There's just far too much chat; presenters talking to correspondents.\" </p> <p>C4 News is, of course, a direct rival of Newsnight. Jon Snow is Paxman's equal, and its political correspondent, Cathy Newman, recently told the Labour whip Siobhain McDonagh live on air that she had been sacked. But criticism is not limited to competitors. \"Of course there is concern,\" says one well-placed BBC source. \"There is even talk of whether it should be remodelled as a discussion programme, which would save money.\" </p> <p>Others believe that, at a time of reduced BBC income, there should be a decision about what is most important. \"No one disputes the need to be more efficient,\" says another source. \"But the cuts are pretty swingeing. It is uncomfortable.\"</p> <p>One of the flash points is foreign reporting. \"There is a specific problem faced by independent film-makers, when they pitch to Newsnight,\" says Mark Galloway, director of the International Broadcasting Trust. \"There is now definitely a problem covering stories off the immediate agenda.\" Galloway cites a recent story about comedians in Kenya involved with politics. Newsnight paid \u00a310,000 towards a film that cost double that.</p> <p>\"It's as if the people who control contracts and budgets are making editorial decisions, and the programme is being suffocated by budgetary decisions,\" says Maggie O'Kane, editorial director of Guardian Films. \"The accountants at the BBC are expecting independent film-makers to go to really dangerous places, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, for a low rate. Film-makers are just going to stop going to them.\"</p> <p>Certainly, Newsnight has a modest budget of around \u00a38.5m a year, under half that of C4 News. The programme's defenders, however, point to the way that it manages to retain a top team of correspondents. \"It's all to do with inventiveness; being original,\" one says . Ron Neil, Newsnight's editor during the Falklands war and a former managing director of BBC news and current affairs, is in this camp. \"I still watch it. It is a programme that is so strong when Paxman is at the helm,\" he says. \"When Paxman's there, if there's a strong editor, and if it is on form, the budget is irrelevant.\"</p> <p>Paxman, though, is contracted for only 100 days a year, sharing duties with Kirsty Wark, Emily Maitlis and Gavin Esler. In addition, the issues go wider than presenting and editing. There is the timing, for instance. Until 2000 Newsnight began an hour after the Nine O'clock News ended. Now it must provide an instant follow-up after a 10pm bulletin. </p> <p>\"Behind all of this is a broader issue, its place in the firmament,\" says Steve Mitchell, deputy director of BBC news and head of multimedia programmes. \"It has to fight hard for its place in a crowded world and exploit its content more widely. When it does the big interview, for example, that needs to be available online. When Paul Mason went to Kenya, we sent a producer versed in audio and online.\" </p> <p>The selection of the next editor is crucial. Mitchell, who is in charge of the process, says that there is a big field. \"I'm interested in innovation, a sense of humour, someone more on the creative side of things,\" he says. \"Peter Barron is a hard act to follow.\"</p> <p>The debate about Newnight's future, including its extended running time and Newsnight Review, will take place after the editor is appointed. But some viewers, such as Professor Brian Winston, an award-winning World In Action producer turned academic, believe that the problems run deep. \"Somebody once said: 'I don't read newspapers, I've read them before' - I fear that seems to apply even more aptly to today's current affairs television,\" he says. \"I don't watch Newsnight. I think that problem is confounded because there is a real sense of having heard it all before ... [But] I am looking at exhilarating, wonderful content, as they insist on calling it, on the digital channels.\"</p> <p>In-house candidates for the editorship include Jasmin Bhuttar, Newsnight's deputy editor and a rising star; Daniel Pearl, deputy editor of the 10 O'Clock News; Eddie Morgan, an ex-Newsnight staffer who worked for the Labour party, before editing The Culture Show; and Peter Rippon, who edits PM and Broadcasting House on Radio 4. </p> <p>Everyone agrees the Newsnight editorship is a crucial role. But there could also be a sting in the tail for whoever emerges as Barron's successor - having to find the next Paxman.</p>",
  "<p>For Burnley's Joey Gudjonsson the visit of Preston gave him the chance to erase the painful memories of last season's league encounter at Turf Moor - and he seized the opportunity with gusto.</p> <p>Nine months ago in the corresponding fixture he was sent off along with his team-mate Chris McCann by Lee Mason and although the same referee was in charge on Saturday there was no repeat of the red cards or the 3-2 defeat as Gudjonsson brought Burnley level from 35 yards, putting them on course for a win that extended their unbeaten run to eight matches. </p> <p>\"This definitely makes up for last season,\" Gudjonsson said. \"It was a really tough time to come through and in the end I got five games for that because we appealed and had two games added so it was really tough.\"</p> <p>The Icelandic midfielder's superb strike dipped and swung past Preston's goalkeeper, Andy Lonergan, to cancel out the lead that Barry Nicholson had given the visitors with a volley 11 minutes earlier. \"When I get the chance to shoot I try and go for it and it went in today,\" Gudjonsson said. \"Some of them go into the stands obviously but when one is hit on target it is pretty beautiful to watch it go in.\"</p> <p>Burnley's manager, Owen Coyle, said: \"It was a very special goal but Joey is capable of doing that. I am telling him on a daily basis to do that because if he can catch it right then it's unstoppable.\"</p> <p>Gudjonsson was a nuisance to Alan Irvine's surprisingly lacklustre side throughout a tense match. Apart from an early attempt by Burnley's Martin Paterson, who should have done better after rounding Lonergan, the game was devoid of quality until Nicholson's pivot and superbly struck volley.</p> <p>It was the only real opportunity Preston had created and Burnley took control after Gudjonsson equalised, with Lonergan having to make two fine saves, from a Steve Thompson header and Wade Elliot's speculative 25-yard shot, as the home team pressed for a second goal.</p> <p>That finally arrived the 64th minute when Steven Caldwell scored from close range. Soon after, another surging Gudjonsson run was halted by Callum Davidson's handball, prompting a straight red card, and Burnley finally made the extra man count in stoppage-time when Chris Eagles successfully concluded a one-on-one with Lonergan.</p> <p>\"It was very disappointing, we didn't pass the ball well and make enough openings,\" Irvine said. \"We didn't get carried away when we were unbeaten for six and we won't again now that we've lost the last two.\"</p> <p>They will need to improve quickly as they prepare for tomorrow's visit of Swansea City, who will be seeking to bounce back from their 4-0 thrashing by Reading at the Madejski Stadium.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Joey Gudjonsson (Burnley)</p>",
  "<p>If Saturday's world championship road race typified the way Nicole Cooke races when the pressure is off, women's cycling will have to watch out over the next couple of years when the newly-crowned world champion said she aims to take pleasure in her racing as she did this weekend on the way to completing her historic double of world and Olympic road titles in one season. </p> <p>Six weeks on from winning her Olympic gold medal, Cooke believes that \"there was always going to be a sense of release after Beijing irrespective of the result\" and that altered the way she raced on Saturday. Yesterday the British Performance Director, Dave Brailsford, praised her \"maturity and patience\" while Cooke said: \"I'd like to think I've changed as a person anyway but it's great to have achieved everything and not have that desperation.</p> <p>\"At times the difference between desperation and wanting to do your best is a very fine one and most of the time I've been in the desperation category, losing control of my tactics. For example, when the lead group formed, I realised it didn't matter if we finished 3sec ahead of the bunch or 1min33sec, we were still going to be the strongest half-dozen there, so working hard to keep away from the rest made no sense.\"</p> <p>The lack of pressure, however, did not alter her attention to detail: the course was an hour's bike ride from her adopted home in Lugano, so she rode out to inspect it on numerous occasions. That helped when it came to gauging the final sprint that took her past the 2006 champion, Marianne Vos, in the last metres. Next year, when the race is held in Mendrisio, on the Swiss side of the border, she will presumably know the circuit better than her own back garden.</p> <p>If there was any desperation on view on Saturday it was on the face of Vos - who raced much as Cooke did en route to two bronze and one silver medal in previous world championships - with the look of a woman who wanted victory so much that she was unable to race clinically. Cooke acknowledged that when it came to attacking on the climbs, Vos was the strongest - something the Welshwoman wants to resolve by next year - but she was repeatedly brought to order by the Germans and Cooke.</p> <p>Cooke held her nerve and took her chances. It might have seemed a complex tactical situation after the emergence of the lead group of five - Vos, the Germans Trixi Worrack and Judith Arndt and the Swede Emma Johansson were the others - but the difference was seen in the way she neutralised one key move with Vos and Worrack: with venom in the initial effort then with coolheadedness as the gap closed.</p> <p>For Cooke this was a sweet win after three times coming close to wearing the fabled rainbow jersey of senior world champion and taking four junior world titles. It was 26 years since a Briton won a senior world road race - that honour fell to Mandy Jones at Goodwood in 1982 - while Cooke is only the sixth Briton, male or female, professional or amateur, to win the senior road race title.</p> <p>The 25-year-old says she hopes to be able to help other talented British women develop and there certainly seem to be plenty in the system. On Saturday Lizzie Armitstead and Jess Allen rode strongly, Emma Pooley looked to be among the strongest in the race until a derailed chain at the key moment ruined her chances and Sharon Laws has come from nowhere in nine months.</p> <p>\"It would be good to do it as part of a professional team,\" said Cooke, although it is as yet unclear whether or not that would be within the Halfords set-up run under the aegis of British Cycling's Olympic team. \"Now I've achieved my ambitions, I want to help others achieve theirs. I remember the friendships I built in my teams early on, and that's the type of thing I'd like to be involved in.\"</p> <p>There were no British heroics in the men's elite race won by the Italian Alessandro Ballan yesterday, apart from a gutsy ride by Sheffield's Russell Downing to complete the 152.5-mile event at the second attempt. Ballan took advantage of a strong Italian team performance to jump clear of a six-rider lead group two miles from the finish, where he received a deafening, rapturous reception from the tifosi, to become the first Italian to win the world title on home soil since 1968. \"I still don't really realise what's happening,\" he said. \"Having people chanting my name helped me a lot.\"</p> <p>His team-mate Damiano Cunego won the sprint for silver while Denmark's Matti Breschel claimed the bronze medal.</p>",
  "<p>As if 25 holes in the day were not enough, Lee Westwood had to go three more in fading light last night before failing in his bid to retain the British Masters at The Belfry. On a fog-free final day the title went instead to Spain's Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o - a win that will probably stop Westwood returning to the world's top 10 after a gap of seven years. </p> <p>Tired all week following his exertions in the Ryder Cup, Westwood was three clear with 10 to play, but was gradually reeled in by Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o. They tied on the 12-under-par total of 276, Westwood finishing with a 70 to his opponent's 67, and after each in turn had made a 10-footer to stay alive, a par-four at the next decided the \u00a3300,000 first prize. Off much the better drive Westwood missed the green for the third time in a row and on this occasion left his chip 15 feet short and missed the putt. </p> <p>\"I just struggled with my swing all day,\" he said. \"I didn't feel under control at any point. I was pleased to be in a play-off as I felt I really hung in there. When Gonzo chipped in at the 12th I think the writing was on the wall. I felt I am at the end of my tether and running on empty.\" </p> <p>Last year's five-shot win in the same event remains Westwood's last success. He has now had 14 top-10 finishes since then, including third place in the US Open in June. </p> <p>It was the 27-year-old Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o's fourth tour victory - and takes his play-off record to a perfect 3-0. Yet it was his first top-10 finish since the Wales Open at the start of June and he came into the week only 105th on the money list. </p> <p>The New Zealander Michael Campbell, joint leader with a round to go, finished third two strokes back. Westwood and Campbell had moved clear of the field with strong finishes to their third rounds when play resumed at 8am yesterday. Campbell, having signed off with a birdie at the 5th in near-darkness on Saturday night, returned to make it four in a row and posted a 65. </p> <p>But Westwood, whose round had begun with three bogeys, grabbed his second eagle in five holes thanks to a five-wood to four feet on the 538-yard 3rd, then birdied the 5th and 6th for a 68. They were both 10 under starting the closing 18 holes, with Jeev Milkha Singh and Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o next best on seven under. </p> <p>\"Cambo is a bit strange in that he either wins the US Open or goes missing for three or four months,\" said Westwood. \"But he is good when he gets in the mix of things and it will be difficult to win with him around.\" </p> <p>As for how he felt about such an early start and such a long day ahead of him Westwood commented: \"I needed it like a hole in the head after last week. You just have to dig deep.\" </p> <p>It looked as if he might have an easy afternoon when he went three clear after seven holes of the final round, but bogeying the 9th and three-putting the 10th for par meant there was more work to be done. Lots more, as it turned out, after Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o chipped in for a dramatic par on the 12th after pushing his tee shot into the stream by the green. </p> <p>He was still one behind at that point, but a pitch to four feet on the next brought him level and they could not be separated over the closing stretch - or on their next two visits to the 473-yard 18th. But the crowd finally saw a winner when it was played for the fourth time. </p> <p>Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o, soaked to the skin and reappearing for a press conference draped in towels, said: \"I think it's probably the best of my four wins.\" And on ending up in the water courtesy of his fellow Spanish players : \"I think it was payback, especially [from Pablo] Larraz\u00e1bal. </p> <p>\"We threw him in at the French Open and I am sure he wanted to get his revenge. It was cold, but it just stank. It smelt terrible, as I do now.\"</p> <p>In the United States, there was more play-off heartache for another European Ryder Cup player as Sergio Garc\u00eda last night surrendered a five-stroke lead to lose the PGA Tour Championship in Atlanta, Georgia, to Camilo Villegas. The Colombian compiled five birdies in six holes from the 8th on his way to a closing four-under-par 66 at East Lake.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda's score of 71 left both players on seven under par, one stroke ahead of the Americans Phil Mickelson (69) and Anthony Kim (69) in an exciting finish.Villegas eventually prevailed with a par at the first extra hole after Garc\u00eda sprayed his tee shot right of the green.</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen months ago this morning's expected announcement on the nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley would have seemed inconceivable. Fifteen days ago the $700bn comprehensive banking bailout which Congress is likely to vote on today would have been just as hard to imagine. A run of bankruptcies, fire sales and hastily arranged marriages has shifted the parameters of the possible. Full-blooded capitalist institutions - once so insistent on their autonomy - are now running to the state for shelter. Wider prosperity has grown so dependent upon the banks that the state cannot safely leave them out in the cold. </p> <p>The Bradford bard, Justin Sullivan, described London as \"the land of gold and poison that beckons to us all\". Once that might have sounded like northern bigotry; this morning it resonates. For the fast-buck culture of the City of London is what brought Bradford &amp; Bingley to its knees. Once a proud mutual, which brought together local savers and local homebuyers, it transformed itself into a bank and has now gone the same way as the other former building societies - all of which have either folded or been bought out. Their commercialisation once seemed to promise a more competitive mortgage market - and a chance for the regions to taste London's financial prosperity. But now market mayhem in the Square Mile is starting to translate into lost jobs in Halifax, in Newcastle and, indeed, in Bradford and in Bingley. </p> <p>Once it became a bank, Bradford &amp; Bingley dabbled in the dodgy derivatives that last year did for the former building society, Northern Rock. Its sin, though, was buy-to-let mortgages, loans for people who see houses as a speculative investment instead of somewhere to live. That was profitable for a time, but now the housing-market tide has turned and investors are handing back the keys. By Friday the beleaguered bank's shares were worth just 20p. </p> <p>The government's decisive move to take control contrasts with last autumn's dithering over Northern Rock - all sorts of complex deals were countenanced before public ownership was plumped for in February. Now that rightwing Republicans in the US have bought out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and, effectively, AIG as well, a pragmatic decision to nationalise can no longer be branded old-style socialism. This has encouraged Labour to act more rapidly this time, but there is an irony here. The case for nationalising the Rock was more powerful than that for taking over Bradford &amp; Bingley. Deposit insurance has been strengthened since, and has there been no bank run this time around. Today, the taxpayer starts out from a less exposed position. Through a special loan, much public money had been invested in the Rock; taking ownership was the surest way to make this money safe. But Bradford &amp; Bingley has not received comparable funds. Putting it into administration - and letting its creditors take the hit - is thus a more plausible option. </p> <p>A managed form of this alternative is being proposed by the Conservatives. Unlike on Northern Rock, where they said the same, they have an arguable case for letting the market run its course. But there are dangers in this tack for shadow chancellor, George Osborne, as he addresses his party in Birmingham today - and not just because it is questionable whether the financial system is strong enough to endure large-scale debt default. Whatever the merits of letting Bradford &amp; Bingley go under, Mr Osborne cannot afford to revert to Tory type by washing his hands of the economic turbulence. He was too slow in embracing the ban on short selling and has an unfortunate back catalogue of quotes demanding deregulation. During the good times, the Conservatives put much more energy into refashioning social policy than they did with economics. From Wall Street to Bingley, the financial order is in transition. The Conservatives have their work cut out to prove that their ideas are keeping pace.</p>",
  "<p>As the global economic storm rips through the western world, Britain faces acute problems in rebuilding a more equal and sustainable economy. This week in Birmingham, David Cameron will strive to project the Conservatives as reliable stewards of the economy. Up to now the Tory revival has been shaped around the need to renew society. As Oliver Letwin argued: \"The social revolution we now need to achieve is as great as the economic revolution that was required in the 1980s and 1990s.\" Cameron has made the theme of \"broken Britain\" central to his politics, saying: \"The greatest challenge of the 1970s and 1980s was economic revival; the greatest challenge in this decade and the next is social revival.\" Through the brilliant construction of language and image Cameron has changed the Conservative party; retrieving some of its paternalist traditions to develop a more sophisticated modern politics.</p> <p>The government's response has been dismissive. But it cannot defeat this new Conservatism without offering a coherent alternative. It has not yet matched Cameron's pro-social rhetoric nor trumped his claim to a new values-based politics. The Conservatives' ethical and emotional language has touched a popular chord. It exposes the lack of sympathy and shrill managerialism that has been a characteristic of New Labour. It resonates among many who would never have voted for Thatcherism. </p> <p>And yet, for all their early boldness, the Tories cannot move beyond the orthodoxies of the past. Despite their emotional literacy they are unlikely to show this week any persuasive desire to move beyond their dogmatic free-market interpretation of Hayek's liberalism. They have no economic strategy with which to enact their pro-social politics and rhetoric of social justice. Economics will increasingly dominate politics - both between and within parties.</p> <p>Tory hostility to the social activist state will threaten the livelihood of millions. Without a credible political economy, their enthusiasm for localism and their ambition to expand the role and the influence of charities, social enterprises and voluntary bodies is less an embrace of local democracy and mutualism and more a revival of Thatcher's thwarted ambition to create a minimal state. The voluntary sector cannot shoulder the kind of structural change they propose. </p> <p>New Labour has not been able to exploit these contradictions due to its tone-deaf language, its one-dimensional take on Cameron and its own outdated political economy. While its centralising instincts and micromanagement of people have allowed the Conservatives to strike a chord with their criticism of state control. They have been able to portray state intervention - which has to be part of any redistributive politics - as an undesirable intrusion into people's lives. </p> <p>Despite their pro-social rhetoric, the New Conservatives will not tackle the structures of power and privilege that are distorting economic development and shaping all our destinies. They cannot bite the hand that feeds them. Two questions lie at the heart of politics over the next decade. What kind of economy do we need to develop a good society? And what kind of state will best meet the needs of individuals? The New Conservatives do not have credible answers to these questions. The future belongs to the left, but to be successful, it must confront its failings and reconnect with people. That task has only just begun.</p> <p><em>\u2022 'Is the future Conservative?', a debate by Comment is Free &amp; Soundings magazine, will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.

  "<p>The rotting carcasses of scores of pets and other animals have been discovered on a Northern Ireland farm regularly visited by children, the Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA) revealed yesterday.</p> <p>Welfare officers who raided the Littleacre Open Farm, in Loughbrickland, County Down, found the rotting bodies of dogs, miniature goats, hamsters, chickens and geese, some of which were decomposed almost beyond recognition.</p> <p>The death toll reinforced urgent calls by the USPCA for the updating of animal cruelty legislation in Northern Ireland, which provides animal welfare inspectors with fewer powers than those in England and Wales. </p> <p>The organisation's chief executive last night told the Guardian that had his staff been operating under English and Welsh legislation they would have intervened far earlier at the farm. </p> <p>Martin Dobbin, a welfare officer with the charity, said: \"We were horrified by the number of dead and decomposing animals. Some of the animals we saw were unrecognisable.</p> <p>\"This would be one of the worst cases I have seen.\"</p> <p>The USPCA was alerted by visitors who noticed dead animals lying on the ground. When officials forced locked doors they found more than 60 bodies. Nobody has been arrested but police are aware of the matter. </p> <p>More than 100 living creatures were taken away. Roosters, pheasants and a llama were among those being transported to USPCA shelters.</p> <p>Dobbin added: \"It was the sheer volume of calls about these animals that alerted us.\"</p> <p>The attractions of the Littleacre Open Farm are listed on one website as: \"Small pets to touch and feed (chicks, lambs, rabbits); rare breeds, waterfowl, birds, cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, poultry, ponies, donkeys, alpacas, deer and lots more. Play area, shop/tearoom, picnic area and old-tyme cottage. Wheelchair friendly.\" </p> <p>No one from the farm could be contacted yesterday.</p> <p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland confirmed that it had attended the farm to assist the USPCA but said there had been no arrests or charges. The USPCA has for several years been urging ministers in the Northern Ireland assembly to change animal welfare laws so that inspectors can intervene at an earlier stage.</p> <p>Stephen Philpott, the chief executive of the USPCA, said: \"In Northern Ireland we have to let animals suffer first, whereas in [Great Britain] the law says it is an offence to 'have conditions likely to cause suffering'. The RSPCA can prevent cruelty happening. We have to let it happen first and then stop the perpetrators when it's happening.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last Tuesday, around midnight, my phone bleeped with a text message. It was from Praz Bansi, hotshot young British player and World Series bracelet winner.</p> <p>\"I dont hate ur river call with the T,\" said this text, \"with him being in the blinds, regardless of wot jesse &amp; roy say.\"</p> <p>Oh, God. River call with a 10 . . . this could only mean my horrible hand against Liam Flood in the Ladbrokes Poker Million. The series is running on Sky Sports 2 - great viewing, as these are two-hour programmes, leaving space for many of the small yet interesting hands that often get cut from one-hour poker edits - but I wasn't watching my heat. If Praz was texting to console, the commentators must have been savage!</p> <p>I had limped with 8 10 of clubs. This allowed Ian Cox to complete the small blind, and Liam Flood to check in the big blind. We all checked a flop of 5 Q A, then Liam bet out when a 10 came on the turn. I called. The river paired the 5, and Liam bet again. After a long, uncomfortable think, I called. It turned out Liam had 10 5 for a full house.</p> <p>But Liam is a loose, aggressive, unpredictable player. It was one of those situations where he had either a huge hand or nothing. A 50/50 for me, really. Everyone knows that in a fast one-table like this, you have to gamble - usually by betting, hoping either to hit your hand or bluff opponents. My excuse for this hand is that calling Liam Flood on the river, with a weak two pair, was just another way of tossing the coin.</p>",
  "<p>The MFI furniture chain was saved from bankruptcy last night by a last-minute management buyout - funded by the private equity group that owned the business.</p> <p>Like many other retailers, MFI, which employs 2,500 staff and owns the Hygena and Schreiber brands, has been battered by the consumer and housing downturn, and by rising costs. Last week the soft furnishings group Roseby's collapsed into administration and the auditors to 400-outlet JJB warned that the sports chain may not survive.</p> <p>MFI has been searching for fresh finance for months. As rumours spread about its predicament, shoppers who could have become customers have steered clear, fearful to place orders in case their cash disappeared and kitchens failed to materialise.</p> <p>Last night MFI said the new deal ensured all orders would be met. \"The MBO [management buyout] will secure the future of the MFI business and safeguard the employees within the store network. Importantly, all customer orders will continue to be fulfilled and trading continues as normal.\"</p> <p>Merchant Equity Partners, which bought the struggling company two years ago for \u00a31 plus debts, is providing a cash \"dowry\" to enable the management, led by chief executive Gary Favell, to take control of the business. The sum is understood to be around \u00a325m plus working capital.</p> <p>Most of that payment will be immediately handed over to the landlords of the group's 192 retail stores as today is quarterly rent day, with MFI due to pay \u00a319m.</p> <p>Last night a spokesman for the company said the deal would be completed by Favell and his team within 24 hours.</p> <p>Favell said: \"I am delighted we have secured the future of the MFI business through this MBO.</p> <p>\"MFI is a fantastic business, and with the large amounts of capital injected over the last two years, we have worked hard to improve service levels and the retail experience for our customers. We have many plans to further improve the business -including discussions with a number of major UK retailers to increase the number and quality of concession partnerships within our stores.\" </p> <p>MFI was founded in 1964 as Mullard Furniture Industries and is the largest fitted furniture business in the UK.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's top bankers and regulators moved to keep the contagion of collapsing banks spreading from the US and Britain to continental Europe last night when Belgium announced the part nationalisation of Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group.</p> <p>Capping a weekend of non-stop emergency meetings to decide Fortis's fate, Yves Leterme, the Belgian prime minister, said Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would pour \u20ac11.2bn (\u00a39bn) into the beleaguered financial services group to try to prevent it becoming the first big casualty of the credit crunch on the continent.</p> <p>Jean-Claude Trichet, the European central bank chief, and Neelie Kroes, the Dutch EU commissioner for competition, went to the Belgian parliament for crisis talks with the Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourg governments and central bankers last night, amid fears that a Fortis collapse would send shockwaves across the EU.</p> <p>Belgian, Dutch and French media reported that various rescue bids were being considered by BNP Paribas of France or ING and Rabobank of the Netherlands, all of which came to nothing.</p> <p>Under the terms of the state rescue, Fortis is also to be forced to divest its \u20ac24bn share in last year's purchase of ABN Amro, the biggest banking takeover ever, which came just before the sub-prime crisis exploded in the US and presented Fortis with a liquidity predicament.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether any of the banks tipped to buy Fortis or take part in a break-up will be in the contest to acquire the share of ABN-Amro.</p> <p>Fortis, which is heavily involved in the car and travel insurance sectors in Britain, has seen two-thirds of its market value wiped out since the beginning of the year, with more than one-third evaporating last week. The damage peaked on Friday, when the company replaced its chief executive, but still saw its share price slump by almost 21%.</p> <p>Belgium's financial regulator, the CBFA, said yesterday it was endeavouring to boost market confidence in the Fortis share price. The announcement late last night was aimed at damage limitation ahead of the markets opening this morning.</p> <p>The Fortis crisis could cause collateral damage to Royal Bank of Scotland, the Belgian-Dutch firm's partner along with Banco Santander of Spain in last year's \u20ac70bn purchase of ABN Amro. </p> <p>The Fortis crisis and the growing pressure for a government bail-out are potentially traumatic for Belgium, a country whose continued existence is in question as never before. Fortis counts among its more than 5 million retail customers around half of the country's population.</p> <p>Fortis is also the UK's third-largest private car insurer and fourth-largest travel insurer. Last month, the company reported a 49% decline in second-quarter profit after credit-related writedowns.</p> <p>Marianne Thyssen, leader of the Christian Democrats and one of the partners in Belgium's governing coalition, told a Belgian television station yesterday that the government was pledging \"100%\" guarantees for all savings with Fortis, although Belgian law guarantees only the first \u20ac20,000 in savings accounts.</p> <p>On Friday, Fortis executives insisted that clients' deposits were safe, pledges that were reinforced by the Belgian government. </p> <p>\"We have taken our responsibility, we have not abandoned the savers,\" Leterme said at a press conference last night.</p>",
  "<p>We're getting a new deal from politicians in their dealings with the media. They have stopped complaining that journalists are too interested in personality. Instead they are working up their life stories and satisfying the demand for it. But in turning their activities into another branch of celebrity culture, they are beginning to understand that they must offer constant drama.</p> <p>Last week, as a result, we saw most papers happily reduce coverage of the Labour party conference to the level of the X Factor final, the only story being the rivalry and performances of the prime minister and his foreign secretary. Now the entertainment moves on: this week it is all about David Cameron and his photogenic wife.</p> <p>The press have been picking over the Brown speech from early summer. It wasn't any longer politics, but human drama: we were left in no doubt that Brown had to give the performance of his life. But who can blame papers for treating politics as showbusiness when we see the prime minister's wife - a professional PR woman - jumping on stage to introduce his speech?</p> <p>I wasn't surprised to hear politicians thrown into the discussion when the PR and journalism networking club Editorial Intelligence talked about the treatment of celebrities a couple of days later. The PR man Mark Borkowski suggested that politicians were now part of celebrity culture and, as a consequence, would experience the short life cycle of their showbusiness counterparts. </p> <p>Boris Johnson exemplifies the politician as celebrity: a journalist who is a politician, a politician whose political success depends on a celebrity conferred by television appearances. No wonder Ken Livingstone was perplexed: his misfortune was to develop a big personality that played in newspapers - until the press discovered a personality that played even better.</p> <p>Dean Godson, research director of the thinktank Policy Exchange, identified the 1983 election as marking a crucial development in the trend for politicians to be given the celebrity treatment. That was when the Conservatives realised that a presidential approach would benefit their candidate Margaret Thatcher in the fight against Michael Foot. Now, he explained, we had a politics that responded to a public interested in political figures only at the moment they were either powerful or about to be powerful.</p> <p>That would explain the failure of Nick Clegg, a nice looking man with a happy family story who has failed to gain real purchase with the newspapers other than for those ill-advised reminiscences about his sexual history. \"It's PGL,\" explained a magazine editor I spoke to. \"Pointless good looks.\" So, until he gets a whiff of power about him, Clegg cannot attain the star quality that makes a newspaper story.</p> <p>Naturally, playing on personality takes you away from political content. It is an approach that culminated last week with the Labour leader addressing conference with the words: \"I want to talk about who I am.\" Is anyone in Labour known better than Brown? As Keith Waterhouse observed in the Mail: \"And so to the Big Me of the act, the Me-Me-Me. Most prime ministers occupy this role. They are self-obsessional like all star turns.\"</p> <p>But the great thing about newspapers, blunt instruments as they may be, is that the truth keeps leaching out, confounding all attempts to manage personalities. Party officials cannot control the press in the manner of the old Hollywood agents. Bit by bit, we construct a pretty clear idea of the people we read about in our newspapers.</p> <p>That is how we understood quickly that Tony Blair looked comfortable on holidays - although we did not like his habit of taking free ones - and Brown did not. The Suffolk holiday shots made him look uncomfortable. In Blair's case, the press's presentation of the friendly guy initially enthralled us and ultimately irritated us. In Brown's, even those newspapers that have remained friendly to him - the Mail, the Sun and to some extent the Telegraph - have largely abandoned attempts to sell us something he isn't.</p> <p>But now that the Browns have got the hang of the cameras, the papers are giving it one last go. There was Sarah Brown, rapidly becoming the starrier of the two, alongside Sarah Palin on that flying visit to the United States. I talked to a couple of newsmen who thought she had been foolish to put herself on stage. Now she was public property. But what, actually, does that mean? A little more interest in her clothes, closer scrutiny of everything she does? She can surely wear that.</p> <p>As for other politicians, they are relegated to supporting roles, bit players in the greater drama. David Miliband had his moment, but failed the test because the media began to realise power was not going to be his. His team had worked hard to build his platform, but then came that disastrous banana picture. If he had any chance of seizing the crown, it disappeared then. If anything, the poor man looked even more contorted in the pictures that showed him congratulating Brown on his speech.</p> <p>The old aphorism was that politics was showbusiness for ugly people. Now it is all about personality, the papers are reluctant to let a man who looks a little nerdy become prime minister.</p> <p><strong>Homage to the real family with power</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown has not entirely repudiated the ways of his predecessor. At least he seems to love the Murdoch family just as much even though a previous appointment prevented his attending Elisabeth Murdoch's birthday party in Oxfordshire. </p> <p>When her father appeared on stage, the guests, who included Tony Blair, David Cameron, George Osborne and a several newspaper editors, very much enjoyed his reading of a note of apology from the prime minister: \"There are only two important Elizabeths and the only Elizabeth who could keep me from Elisabeth M's 40th birthday party is Elizabeth W.\" The Sun's generous coverage of Brown last week suggests that Rupert Murdoch has overlooked the prime minister's outrageous act of lese majeste in choosing to attend on the queen.</p> <p><strong>Opportunity knocks</strong></p> <p>The great Ann Leslie played hostess at a glittering party at the Reform Club, launching her biography on a sea of champagne. Having noted her hatred of speeches, she made a good one, identifying the particular felicity of her career: \"I have been fortunate to work for two generations of proprietor who not only love journalism but actually love journalists.\"</p> <p>We all drank more and agreed the great days were over for journalism. What young woman could look at journalism now with such hopes? Except that, slightly hungover, I met one the next day, a beneficiary of the Journalism Diversity Fund - a bursary to fund trainee journalists - who had found her first job, on the Newcastle Journal. \"It's brilliant,\" she said. \"And I have done my first death knock.\" There is a lot of gloom about, but the peculiar magic of journalism still exerts a pull.</p> <p>\u00b7 Peter Wilby is away</p>",
  "<p>'I didn't pick on the Pope,\" Sabina Guzzanti insists as she stirs her coffee. \"That was the only remark they hit upon in a 20-minute address. It made it look as if I delivered a speech to say the Pope's a poof.\" We are sitting at a table outside a cafe in the graffiti-covered San Lorenzo district of Rome, home to students and immigrants. Guzzanti is wrapped in an overcoat and scarf against the onset of autumn. The temperature has plunged to 22C.</p> <p>If ever there were someone who reaffirmed Dario Fo's vision of the comedian as heir to the deeply subversive medieval giullare, or jester, then it is this 45-year-old satirist with the face and air of a naughty, knowing elf. In Italy, she has been in and out of headline-grabbing controversies for at least 10 years.</p> <p>But this month she went global. On September 10, prosecutors in Rome asked for leave from the government to put her on trial, charged with \"contempt of the Pope\". Addressing a big leftwing rally in the Italian capital, the comedian had said: \"In 20 years [the former Cardinal Joseph] Ratzinger will be dead and will end up in hell, tormented by queer demons - not passive ones, but very active ones.\"</p> <p>Within 48 hours, her case had even worked its way into the US presidential election. Sitting alongside John McCain on Barbara Walters' morning talkshow, The View, the actor Whoopi Goldberg asked: \"Did you know that in Italy a comedian called Guzzanti risks five years in jail for a joke about the Pope?\" It brought howls of dismay from the live audience.</p> <p>Quite a few Italians, too, were shocked to discover that it was an offence in their country to poke fun at the pontiff. The offence was introduced in 1929 by a treaty between the papacy and Italy's then fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini. The treaty was revised in the 1980s and one of the changes was to remove the offence of which Guzzanti was accused.</p> <p>\"But in Italy there is this habit of passing lots of new laws and only seldom remembering to cancel the old ones,\" says Guzzanti. \"So the new ones and the old co-exist.\"</p> <p>On September 18, Silvio Berlusconi's justice minister decided the case should be dropped. By then, as Guzzanti observed, her critics and the Italian right in general had \"made a bloody awful spectacle of themselves to the rest of the world\". The affair gave outsiders a rare glimpse of the wackiness rife in the Italian legal system.</p> <p>But the fact that anyone should try to use a 79-year-old law of dubious validity to nail Guzzanti gives an inkling of the apoplectic rage she can inspire in her conservative compatriots. It may not be a coincidence that Guzzanti used the same rally to voice, in characteristically blunt fashion, a claim that had been hinted at in newspaper reports and talked about in bars across Italy. This was that Berlusconi had had an affair with his equal opportunities minister, a 32-year-old former topless model, Mara Carfagna, and that explicit evidence of their relationship had come to light in a telephone conversation recorded during an investigation into other matters. Berlusconi has denied the allegation and Carfagna threatened to sue Guzzanti, but has never done so.</p> <p>\"She didn't do so because I could have asked to read and bring to court the [transcripts] of the [telephone] intercepts,\" she says.</p> <p>Like many a giullare, the price of her jibes at the rich and powerful has been exile - not from the realms of an affronted prince, but from the kingdom of the mighty Silvio, Il cavaliere (\"the knight\"), as he likes to be called.</p> <p>Though most Italians have long come to accept it, his control of what they see on their television sets is flagrantly, and perilously, abnormal. Since being sworn in again this year as prime minister, he has had direct or indirect control of six of the seven channels from which the vast majority of Italians get their news and the other information on which they base their opinions. </p> <p>Not the least important thing about Guzzanti is that she embodies what this means. In practice, it is forbidden in Italy to give Berlusconi anything more than a gentle ribbing, or ask the really hard questions about how he obtained his wealth and power. That is precisely what she did on her TV programme five years ago when Berlusconi was last in power. It was taken off the air by the state-owned RAI after only two episodes. Lawyers for one of Berlusconi's companies then sued Guzzanti for \u20ac20m in damages. They did not win because the judge ruled that the things she had said about him on air were true. But she has never been allowed back onto RAI, except for the very occasional guest performance.</p> <p>The frustration that this must engender in a talented performer is sometimes given by others, particularly on the Italian centre-left, as an explanation for what are regarded as her vulgar excesses, such as her quip about the Pope. Understandably enough, the theory generally goes, she is trying to force herself back into the public eye.</p> <p>If you want to really wind up Guzzanti - if you want to see a glint appear in her eyes like a struck match - then all you have to do is set out this view. \"This is defamatory,\" she says. \"This is said by people who are very much against me and are the worst enemies of any sort of change. I can have visibility whenever it suits. I'm very popular, certainly a lot more popular than they are. If I take part in these rallies, it's not to get visibility. It's a complete bore going to rallies. It's always the same four of us from the arts who go. So really they ought to thank us because we have the courage to say what others don't, including those who write these shitty articles. Anyway, what I say is not outrageous. It's true.\"</p> <p>It is clear that Guzzanti holds the Pope in low esteem. Referring to his role as former head of a Vatican department in the sex abuse scandals that have rocked the Catholic church, she argues he had \"besmirched himself with several very serious offences\".</p> <p>But the reason, she says, that she had brought him into her speech to the rally in Rome was that she sees some aspects of the Vatican's conservative teaching as underpinning a \"rapid authoritarian escalation\" in Italy. She cites a string of recent incidents in which suspected far-right-wingers have beaten up gay people. \"The discrimination [in Catholic doctrine] against homosexuals - now that really ought to be an offence, especially if it provokes behaviour that is homophobic and violent.\"</p> <p>The row over her speech - and this is why Goldberg picked up on it - goes to the heart of a topical debate. Though issues of faith are becoming increasingly entangled with politics, many people of faith want religious institutions and their leaders to be accorded a special respect that is not conceded to, say, politicians. The prosecutors' application to indict Guzzanti can be seen as an attempt to establish that principle - one she absolutely refuses to honour.</p> <p>\"First of all,\" she says, \"what I was speaking about were the politics of the Pope. It's not as if I'd shot off my mouth on theological issues. It is the Pope who should have respect for our political institutions. At the point at which he gets involved in politics I have every right to criticise him for his political activity. Second, I am not even in agreement with the general principle. I believe that in a democracy there is no right not to be offended. I think that anyone ought to be free to say whatever he or she likes at any moment.</p> <p>\"If someone says things that are offensive, gratuitous and stupid, one has to assume there will be others able to demonstrate that what you said was offensive, gratuitous and stupid.\"</p> <p>For that reason, she is against the limitations on Holocaust denial. And the Danish cartoonists who ridiculed Mohammed? An instant's hesitation, then she says: \"I'm on their side.\"</p> <p>Rather than respect for religion, she says, what is increasingly evident is \"submission, fear\". Pussyfooting around someone else's ideas is tantamount to \"treating him like an idiot who can't bear to hear an opinion different from his own. That is not necessarily respect.\"</p>",
  "<p>The revelation that major German companies spied on journalists - and not just investigative reporters - has led to the emergence of further scandals.</p> <p>If a sequel were to be made to the Oscar-winning film The Lives of Others, the Stasi agent played by Ulrich M\u00fche wouldn't end up delivering junk mail for a living after the collapse of the German Democratic Republic - he'd begin a new career working for a private detective agency, spying on journalists on behalf of Germany, Inc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, it has emerged that some of Germany's biggest and most prestigious companies, such as Deutsche Telekom, systematically spied on journalists who had written critical stories about them - in some cases using former Stasi agents to do so. The scandal has further damaged the image of corporate Germany, already rocked by a series of sleaze scandals. But it also suggests that not just investigative journalists but also financial journalists may be increasingly subject to surveillance.</p> <p>The trickle of revelations about spying by German companies began at the end of May, when it emerged that in 2005 and 2006 Deutsche Telekom (which also owns T-Mobile in the UK) had given data about phone calls between its senior executives and journalists to a Berlin consultancy, Network Deutschland, to establish the identity of a senior figure within the company thought to be leaking information.</p> <p>That was bad enough. But then it began to become apparent that the \"Pink Giant\" - so-called in Germany because of its pink logo - was engaged in some far more disturbing cases of spying on journalists going back years. It is even suspected by journalists at the business magazine Capital that the company may have placed an intern in the newsroom to gain information about the sources of one of its reporters, Reinhard Kowalewsky. </p> <p>In addition, it has emerged that other leading Germany companies have worked with the same security consultants as Deutsche Telekom and in some cases spied on journalists too. The latest revelation, which emerged last week as part of the ongoing criminal investigation into the affair, is that Deutsche Telekom also spied on Michael Sommer, the head of the DGB (the German equivalent of the TUC) and a board member of Deutsche Telekom.</p> <p>But probably the creepiest tale to come out of the investigation is that in 2000 Deutsche Telekom hired a British private security company called Control Risks to get to the bottom of who was behind leaks to Tasso Enzweiler, at the time the chief reporter for Financial Times Deutschland. Control Risks in turn hired Desa Investigation &amp; Risk Protection - a Berlin detective agency set up by two former Stasi agents who worked for a department responsible, among other things, for spying on western journalists - which sent employees to follow Enzweiler around the clock for two weeks. </p> <p>The 16-page report Desa produced on the comings and goings of their \"target person\" reads exactly like a Stasi report, detailing among other things how the two agents photographed Enzweiler shopping with his wife and children. \"I was terrified and furious,\" says Enzweiler. \"It was a complete invasion of my privacy.\"</p> <p>The scandal follows several other recent cases in which German journalists have been the targets of covert surveillance. In the past few years the BND, the German equivalent of MI6, has admitted to spying on several journalists. </p> <p>It also recalls a similar case in the US involving Hewlett-Packard, which hired an investigative firm to snoop on nine reporters in 2006. It went through the Wall Street Journal reporter Pui-Wing Tam's rubbish and used the last four digits of her social security number to fraudulently gain access to her home and mobile phone records. The scandal led to the resignation of HP's chairwoman Patricia Dunn and the company having to pay $14.5m (\u00a37.9m) in damages.</p> <p>Based in London Bridge, Control Risks, which describes itself as a risk consultancy, was originally set up in 1975 as part of the corporate travel services company Hogg Robinson, but was spun off after a management buyout in 1982. It now has 700 staff in 27 offices worldwide and says that the vast majority of FTSE 100 companies use at least one of its services. Much of its work involves analysing political, security and integrity risks on behalf of companies considering investing abroad, as well as helping companies investigate corruption and industrial espionage. It provides security guards for British diplomatic staff in Iraq, for example.</p> <p>Its chief executive, Richard Fenning, says that although the company's Berlin office, which employs around 30 people, is \"managed closely\" from London, he was shocked to read in the Financial Times that it had spied on journalists. </p> <p>Deutsche Post and Lufthansa have also said they worked with Control Risks, though they insist it did nothing improper on their behalf (Control Risks itself refuses to confirm who its clients are). Fenning says he is \"as confident as I can be\" that the company has not used subcontractors who employ former Stasi agents or use \"Stasi techniques\" since 2003 (he is unable to check what happened before this date), although he admits it does still use former intelligence agents in other countries, including ex-KGB and FSB agents in Russia.</p> <p>Fenning says he is \"absolutely confident\" that Control Risks has never directly or indirectly spied on journalists in Britain. He also says that, although there are former journalists among the company's staff and it hires freelance journalists for specific pieces of work, it never has and never would \"set off journalists against each other\".</p> <p>As well as the impact on individual journalists themselves, spying has wider implications for investigative journalism. \"Whistleblowers are becoming much more cautious than they used to be,\" says Thomas Leif of Netzwerk Recherche, a group of investigative journalists in Germany. Gavin McFadyean, director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in London, would not be surprised to see similar cases of spying by companies in the UK. \"When you go after people with deep pockets, it's easy for them to use plausibly deniable connections to get at you,\" he says.</p> <p>There is, however, a big question mark over whether spying on journalists even yields useful information. And there is a big danger for companies in spying through subcontractors: it can leave them vulnerable to blackmail by the very people hired to spy on their behalf. </p> <p>The original scandal involving Deutsche Telekom broke after it attempted to terminate its relationship with Network Deutschland, the security firm it had hired to identify the source of its leak. Network Deutschland, however, claimed it was still owed money. It was when Deutsche Telekom refused to pay that Network Deutschland passed on details of the spying operation to the news magazine Der Spiegel, which ran the story.</p>",
  "<p>It is not the way the bosses of Britain's biggest banks normally spend Saturday mornings. But this weekend the golf clubs were left in the garages as John Varley, the Barclays chief executive, and his counterparts from Britain's biggest banks trooped in to the Treasury for a 9am meeting with Alistair Darling, the chancellor. Some of the bank bosses joined the proceedings by teleconference as they were based too far from London to attend in person. </p> <p>As the haze lifted off St James's Park, which backs on to the Treasury, the message from the government was simple: a solution to the sorry saga of Bradford &amp; Bingley needed to be found before the financial markets opened in London this morning. Darling had already briefed Gordon Brown on the crisis after the prime minister touched down at Heathrow from his visit to Washington and New York. The chancellor was now asking the banks how would they feel about taking over the ailing buy-to-let lender.</p> <p>The chancellor, the assembled Treasury mandarins and the government's financial advisers from Morgan Stanley were disappointed, but hardly surprised, by the answer: thanks, but no thanks.</p> <p>None of the bankers was ready to mount a full-blown rescue. Eric Daniels, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB, was barely a week into the emergency takeover of HBOS. Another deal, even one as small as B&amp;B, would be too much to ask. Varley and his team at Barclays were also busy with their international expansion plans on Wall Street after taking over parts of the collapsed Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>That left Darling and his advisers to put most of the pressure on HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Spanish group Santander - which as well as owning Abbey is in the throes of taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester. HSBC, which had also been sounded out about taking over HBOS a week ago, was reluctant to bail out B&amp;B which, despite its 200 branches, was not attractive enough for the chief executive, Michael Geoghegan, to contemplate. </p> <p>RBS also had better things to do than take over B&amp;B. Relieved that the spotlight had been on HBOS, the bank's chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin, knew he would find it impossible to convince his shareholders of any strategic fit with B&amp;B. </p> <p>That left Santander, which has so far weathered the financial storm well. Represented by Abbey's UK boss Lord Burns, who as Treasury permanent secretary during the 1992 sterling crisis knows about emergency meetings at No 1 Horse Guards Road, Santander was less enthusiastic than the Treasury had hoped. </p> <p>With the possibility of a private rescue all but dead, it was time for the Treasury to activate Plan B. The writing had been on the wall for the former building society for some time and Whitehall had spent months preparing a contingency plan. Ministers could sense there was going to be little appetite to swallow up B&amp;B, a small bank with little strategic significance, but thought there might be takers for a part-public, part-private deal.</p> <p>Under this plan, the public sector would take control of B&amp;B's mortgage book and a commercial bank would take over the deposits from savers. It was not what ministers would have preferred but last night the sense in Whitehall was that it was the best that could have been obtained in the circumstances.</p> <p>Santander stepped in and agreed to take over B&amp;B's branch network, and \u00a322.2bn of savings deposits, but was reluctant to bid for B&amp;B outright.</p> <p>Given the circumstances there was the real fear that last week's collapse in B&amp;B's share price would prompt its customers to start to withdraw their funds.</p> <p>Discussions about a long-term solution for B&amp;B had been under way ever since it announced a \u00a3400m capital raising in May. That was a disaster and the six big banks - Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Abbey - had been forced by the Financial Services Authority to take big stakes in the lender to keep it afloat. The FSA had already been holding regular updates about the lender, but on Friday night Darling and his advisers stepped up the pace.</p> <p>With Tom Scholar, managing director of international and finance at the Treasury, taking charge of the negotiations, the bankers realised the stakes were being raised. When the Treasury, rather than the FSA, takes the lead in negotiations, it means a problem has turned into a crisis.</p> <p>This time last week, the government, Bank of England and FSA were hoping that this would not be B&amp;B's fate. The bank's share price started last week stronger after hopes were raised of a US bail-out of mortgage assets. While B&amp;B suffered a downgrading of its debt rating, Richard Pym, its chief executive, worked quickly to seize the initiative.</p> <p>He announced a dramatic downsizing of a troublesome contract with GMAC which was the cause of much of the rise in mortgage arrears at the lender. He also convinced Barclays to act as a counterparty in the financial market,s so that its weakening credit rating would not deter investors from buying its bonds. He even closed the door to new business by announcing 370 job cuts, including the advisers working in B&amp;B branches on selling mortgages. Even so, B&amp;B's shares continued to fall. </p> <p>The authorities were last night hoping that when the markets open today they will avoid the scenes of worried bank customers taking their savings out. Quite how they will appease shareholders such as Legal &amp; General and Prudential's M&amp;G, whose arms were twisted to support the summer's rights issue at 55p, is another matter.</p> <p>Nationalisation means their shares, and those of 850,000 private investors - will be worthless.</p>",
  "<p>Haile Gebrselassie yesterday justified his decision to miss the marathon at last month's Olympic Games when he broke his own world record in Berlin and took distance running into a new age. The greatest endurance athlete of all time became the first man to dip under 2hr 4min for the 26.2-mile race with a stunning performance then predicted he will go even quicker.</p> <p>\"I can run 2:03:30,\" said Gebrselassie, 35, moments after his time 2:03:59 beat his old record by 27 seconds. \"It is possible, but now I am running against my age as well. This is just a record and tomorrow someone can break it. There are so many good runners and I suppose I will just have to run faster.\"</p> <p>Gebrselassie chose not to run the marathon in Beijing because of fears that smog would set off an asthma attack, instead returning to the track, where he finished sixth in the 10,000m. It meant enough energy was reserved for his return to Berlin, where he had set the record time 12 months ago.</p> <p>On a sunny but cool morning on a flat course, Gebrselassie took control from the start. At halfway, he was 25 seconds faster than last year and with almost four miles left, he broke away from the Kenyan James Kwambai, his nearest challenger.</p> <p>\"The pacemaking from the beginning to the end was perfect and I have never seen weather like this,\" said Gebrselassie. \"It happens once in a lifetime.\"</p> <p>His victory brought the 26th world record of his career and London in 2012 remains very much in the plans of the double Olympic 10,000m champion. \"You should never announce you are going to retire is my philosophy,\" said Gebrselassie. \"Look at Lance Armstrong, he retires for three years, and wants to make a comeback. Let retirement come by itself. That's why I have plans to run for many years.\"</p> <p>Gebrselassie's win, his third successive in Berlin, came in front of huge crowds who also saw a home victory by Irina Mikitenko in 2:19:19 in the women's race.</p>",
  "<p>There's a dusty old cliche in politics: a party on the up have a spring in their step. In Birmingham I begin to see what it means. As David Cameron and his entourage process round the conference, they simply walk differently from Labour. It's a kind of shoulders-back, chin-up foot-bounce and stride. It proclaims self-confidence and some kind of divine right to rule, suppressed for years and now breaking out all over.</p> <p>These quirks of body language matter. They are why it's still worth coming to party conferences. As the economic crisis continues to rage, Tory faces are poker-serious. Cameron goes on about the contract with voters not yet being sealed. They are scared of premature swaggering, that Kinnock air-punching moment. But never mind what they say. Look at the walk. The polls may have narrowed a bit, but the Tories are quite sure they are marching back to power.</p> <p>That being so, the Conservatives' big challenge is whether they sound like a caustic opposition, or like a responsible government-in-waiting. David Cameron knows it. He had his most serious face on yesterday, a non-flashy tie and repeatedly used the word \"responsible\". </p> <p>He and George Osborne plaintively ask why Brown and Alistair Darling don't invite them for joint talks, as the Republicans invited the Democrats. Well, even as the banking story unfolded in London, everyone was playing politics. Labour has no need to bring in the Tories because the Tories don't control \"Congress\". Why would Brown want to give any kind of unnecessary platform to Cameron, given the vile personal abuse Cameron showers him with?</p> <p>The danger for the Conservatives, which they seem unable to avoid, is that they make good rhetorical points without actual substance. William Hague, Osborne and Cameron all addressed the party faithful yesterday, and there were plenty of good soundbites, such as Cameron's \"Gordon, you have had your boom and your reputation is now bust\". But the cocky Tory leadership has to show it is capable of more than rhetoric.</p> <p>It may sound smart to be against both a taxpayer-financed rescue of failing banks and against letting them fail. Whatever the government does, you can then criticise them: either for loading more bills on hard-pressed taxpayers, or for being irresponsible with the system. But what is the Osborne solution? Apart from dwelling on the \"we wouldn't begin here\" point, Osborne airily suggests that the Bank of England should be in charge of \"restructuring\" Bradford and Bingley. This has left Treasury officials, working round the clock this weekend to find a rescue plan, baffled.</p> <p>At present, the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority are all working to restructure B&amp;B. What Osborne's idea of letting the Bank of England take total control seems to mean is going into administration by another name. He claims the creditors would feel the pain, rather than the British taxpayer - but why would they? No, in the words of one Treasury man this weekend, the Tory plan is \"utterly reckless\", risking a loss of confidence that could endanger the whole banking system.</p> <p>Or take their other big idea, putting some kind of control over public spending in the hands of yet another quango, the Office for Budget Responsibility. It's a bad idea in principle. If governments don't control public spending or borrowing, they are barely governments. This is supposed to be a party that believes in restoring the authority of the Commons, and of cabinet government, not handing it away to unelected officials. Tory MPs I've talked to privately ridiculed it as a vacuous Blairite soundbite. Something's difficult? Now in politics, you try to hand it over to somebody else.</p> <p>Yet this is another policy that doesn't mean what it says. For the proposed new body wouldn't actually have any powers to compel the Treasury to do anything. It would simply report. Sure, if it reported that a Tory government was borrowing too much and spending too much that would be mildly shaming. But not much more so than Tory columnists or Commons select committees or respected bankers saying the same. It's shallow oppositionist politics of the thinnest kind.</p> <p>The truth is that the economic crisis has stripped away almost everything positive, optimistic and distinctive the Conservatives had to say. Cameron has simply ditched his green agenda. On green taxes, persuading people to turn from cars and cheap air travel and even on issues like airport expansion and nuclear power, they have gone silent.</p> <p>What about tax cuts? The Conservatives know they are more likely in the short term to have to raise taxes. If not, they will have to slash public spending. Yet not only are they committed for the next few years to matching Labour, they are still making spending commitments. Those 3,000-plus new state schools won't be cheap. The expansion of the armed forces won't, nor the new prisons. It isn't their fault that they are trapped. But trapped they are.</p> <p>Let's not forget the \"broken society\". I don't see how giving a slight tax advantage to married couples is going to stop knife crime, or reduce the amount of litter and graffiti around, as Cameron seems to suggest. Slogans are easy, but the detail remains scant.</p> <p>None of this may make much difference at the next general election. If the country is fed up with New Labour and has failed to warm to Gordon Brown, then voters will swing to Cameron, however thin his agenda. The economic crisis may help him. It gets him off some contentious thinking on green issues.</p> <p>Yet even without difficult decisions to be made, Cameron has to explain what the new Tories stand for. Do they have distinctive, properly thought out policies? Or are they content to kick a deeply unpopular government in hard times? So far, they still seem more Flashman than Gladstone.</p> <p>You could sum up the policies: don't do much on the banking crisis, have a divisive referendum on Europe, plunge the schooling system into an expensive flurry of organisational change and promise to cut taxes for the well-off, but only some time in the future. Oh yes, and restore weekly rubbish collections. Many voters will barely notice, and Labour is too busy disembowelling itself to make these points; but it hardly looks like a shrewd plan for power.</p> <p>I could be wrong. Maybe there is a clear and detailed agenda waiting to be unveiled, something more than heckling and soundbites. It's just that so far, there's not much sign of it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.ashley@theguardian.com\">j.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Jack Straw's address to the Labour party conference was a subdued affair, but then the justice system is not at the moment high on the political agenda. Jacqui Smith's was equally modest. There was not much new in either speech. Both emphasised the substantial drop in crime under Labour. The problem is that while the figures may be statistically correct over the whole range of crime, there is room for debate about those crimes that preoccupy the public - those involving knives, guns and other violence. To be fair, there have been various government initiatives; it is too early to judge whether any of them will have any effect. </p> <p>The justice secretary did, however, raise an important issue to do with one of the Labour government's most disgraceful, if low-profile, failures - the decline in people's access to civil justice. </p> <p>Once, we had a proud legal aid system, providing legal help and representation to people with a worthy case who couldn't afford to go to law. That system is in disarray. </p> <p>Part of it was supposed to be replaced by \"no win, no fee\", but that has not worked as hoped. Jack Straw concentrated on one aspect of \"no win, no fee\" arrangements. </p> <p>\"It's claimed they have provided greater access to justice, but the behaviour of some lawyers in ramping up their fees in these cases is nothing short of scandalous. So I am going to address this, and consider whether to cap more tightly the level of success fees that lawyers can charge.\"</p> <p>But that scandal has been around for some years, as has another one, to do with the reluctance of lawyers to take on cases other than the easy, winnable ones, which guarantee a decent fee. Then there's the scandal of the hidden costs, where a victorious litigant could end up with only a tiny proportion of his winnings, or even nothing at all. </p> <p>There's a review of \"no win, no fee\" under way, commissioned by the government; hopes of radical proposals are not high.</p> <p>Straw proclaimed again that legal aid spending per head in England and Wales is the highest in the world; he did not go on to explain that most of it went on paying lawyers in criminal cases, leaving even less for civil litigation. An exercise in robbing Peter to pay Paul, where Paul is made up of thousands of people with justified legal claims who are denied access to justice. </p> <p>I must not forget to mention one firm statement of intent made by Mr Straw. The government is to go ahead with introducing \"high-visibility jackets\" for offenders receiving community punishments - an idea first announced by Hazel Blears years ago. Well, it does take a long time to get the colour just right. </p> <p>I wrote last week that there were now two openly gay judges in the high court or above. In fact, there are three. The one I hadn't mentioned is Sir Roderic Wood, who sits in the high court's family division. And there's a small piece of good news for women's equality in the criminal justice system. According to the latest statistic on judges and the courts, published last week, women magistrates now outnumber men - for the first time ever. As of April 1 this year, the figures are 14,747 to 14,672.</p>",
  "<p>Echoing Alastair Campbell's famous line to journalists on Tony Blair and religion, Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards last week declared: \"We don't do frustration.\" But just about everyone else in the industry it oversees has plenty to be frustrated about as the regulator grinds through the gears of its long-running review of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>Ofcom itself could also be frustrated by the behaviour of broadcasters and a sense of its own impotence. Phase two of the Ofcom review, published last week, is characteristically thorough and thoughtful, but changes little after positing three ideas for consideration - evolution of the existing model with ITV and Five maintaining PSB obligations; the BBC and a publicly-funded Channel 4 with limited competitive funding; or a broad competitive funding model. </p> <p>Some funding options that were ruled out in the leaked \"storyline\" document obtained by MediaGuardian in July - including the idea of imposing industry levies on ISPs, MP3 players or televisions - have been put back on the table. Handing over a stake in BBC Worldwide is infinitely preferable to losing control of a portion of the licence fee for the corporation, particularly if it can be branded as a BBC \"partnership\" initiative. Hence that goes back in the pot too. </p> <p>The shift in tone could have resulted from the new mood music coming from the department of culture, media and sport. Culture secretary Andy Burnham has been quick to make clear that it is for Ofcom to do the research and deliver the options, and for government to make the decisions. </p> <p>\"Ed and I have a really good relationship. We are each clear about our different roles. I look to Ed and Ofcom to advise me about the options,\" says Burnham, diplomatically. \"But questions of public service broadcasting quite rightly fall to parliament - they go to the heart of our democracy and our country. Ultimately, it's our call.\" </p> <p>Increasingly, there seem to be two debates going on. One is highly detailed, heavily researched, technocratic argument among regulators, broadcasters and policy wonks. There, broadcasters bicker and brief against one another and the regulator while novel notions such as introducing a sales tax on iPods are discussed. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, the fate of the media industry is sliding down the agenda of both the government and the public as the first teeters on the brink of implosion and the other grapples with the consequences of a global economic meltdown. Against that backdrop the fate of Channel 4, never mind the introduction of a new competitive funding mechanism to maintain plurality in regional news, starts to look like small beer. </p> <p>But the debate couldn't be more real for the 500 ITV employees who face the axe after plans to cut regional news services were rubber-stamped by Ofcom. The strong regional flavour that was ITV's USP - and which Burnham said on Friday he still held dear while pining for the days of the late Tony Wilson - is gone for good. There are rumours of even heavier job cuts at ITV, and last week Channel 4 announced 150 job losses and \u00a3100m in cuts over two years as the advertising downturn compounded its structural woes. </p> <p>Burnham attempted to cut through the rhetoric in a speech to the Royal Television Society's International Conference on Friday. Belatedly admitting that it was time to speed up the process, he promised answers by January and legislative action shortly afterwards. </p> <p>It was an attempt to answer the nagging questions that have been swirling around since the beginning of the latest review. Namely, will Labour have the political will to get any necessary legislation through before a general election? And WWDD? That's What Will Dave Do, if and when the Tories get in? In an interview with MediaGuardian following his speech, Burnham attempted to quell those fears. There would be not necessarily be any need for primary legislation to plug the funding gap facing public service broadcasting from 2012, he suggested, adding that time was of the essence. </p> <p>He promised that the government had the will to help but seemed to make it clear there would be no new money put into the system, despite Ofcom estimating a gap of between \u00a3145m and \u00a3230m, including C4's share of up to \u00a3100m.</p> <p>Instead, he proposed a \"new deal\" with the industry. Essentially: stop squabbling, work within your existing means and I'll do what I can to push the chosen plan through parliament. \"I'd like the industry to come together and say this is the right thing to do. What's important is sensible cooperation. I'd like to underline that phrase two or three times,\" said Burnham. The promise comes with a threat: \"The degree of consensus I am presented with come January might then dictate the speed with which we can make changes. If it is a polarised picture, it will spill over into the political debate in parliament.\" </p> <p>There are those at senior levels within the BBC who still believe Ofcom has it in for the corporation and is hell-bent on getting its hands on the licence fee. Richards looked exasperated, but not always convincing, as he spelled out for the umpteenth time his conviction that taking the \u00a3130m so-called \"surplus\" licence fee and redistributing it would not weaken the BBC's \"core programmes and services\". Meanwhile, senior Channel 4 executives continue to believe that the BBC is playing its own game and is not entirely serious about its offers of help. Asked whether he felt any ideological reluctance to sharing the licence fee, Burnham said: \"In any scenario, I would want to see a strong BBC. I am ideological about that.\" </p> <p>The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, pointedly dismissed any of Ofcom's future models - suggesting that none of them held the answer - and proposed his own \"new deal\" in which the corporation, not the regulator or any other new body, was at the heart of maintaining plurality. In a speech on Friday that appeared designed to blind-side Ofcom and align Burnham's aims with the BBC's, he insisted that sharing its assets, expertise and technology with other broadcasters could amount to more than warm words. </p> <p>He said the BBC was making \"significant progress on a set of tangible and economically significant initiatives\" to help its fellow PSBs. </p> <p>\"We need a better debate about the future of public service broadcasting. Less spin. Less certainty that the regulatory levers are the only levers to achieve the right result. Less sitting back and waiting for the politicians or somebody else to ride to the rescue,\" he said. \"We need to work together to give this unique, sometimes slightly wayward, ultimately very precious system of ours a great future.\" </p> <p>But Burnham's Tory opposite number, the shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, is not convinced by Burnham's posturing and believes he is no closer to making his mind up. </p> <p>\"This isn't something for party political point-scoring. Public service broadcasting is a bit like the constitution, it needs a broad consensus and it's part of our culture. But I have to say I'm disappointed. You could end up with a situation where they won't make a decision until the next election and it could fall onto my plate,\" he says. \"The trouble is, if you listen to Andy Duncan, he doesn't think Channel 4 can survive that long.\"</p> <p>Hunt, who insists that he is against privatising Channel 4 and wants to maintain a strong PSB system but is still eyed with suspicion by those who remember the last Tory government, adds: \"I'm very nervous. There has to be plurality of provision so that it's not just the BBC. We may not have the time to sit on our hands any longer. It would be a tragedy if, through dithering by the government, they end up going to the wall.\" </p> <p>And even if Burnham does come to a quick decision, suggests Hunt, he will still have to convince his boss. \"Andy may say that the decision is going to be his, but actually it's going to be Gordon Brown's. You're not going to be able to just pick a solution off the shelf, the culture secretary is going to have to sell it to the prime minister.\" </p> <p>Even so, between Ofcom's release of its thoughtful, expansive but ultimately frustrating 155-page document on Thursday and Burnham's speech 24 hours later, the game changed. \"We've been stuck for too long in the broad options. This is not the time to focus on distractions. There really needs to be a bit of realpolitik and a sense of getting the job done,\" Burnham told MediaGuardian. \"There is a recognition of the urgency within government. I am asking the industry to work with me.\" </p> <p>All of which rules out all but the most politically expedient and practical remedies and leaves spectrum reallocation, BBC assets and the so-called \"surplus licence fee\" the most likely bargaining chips. It's clear that Ofcom's more complicated funding suggestions will fall by the wayside. This is likely to lead to yet more frustration at Riverside House.</p> <p>Already, Ofcom has gone from proposing a a revolutionary new intervention (the Public Service Publisher) to essentially yoking itself to Channel 4 to preserve plurality in the digital age. This new cry for pragmatism and practicality further restricts its room for manoeuvre. </p> <p>A process that has meandered along for five years may be concluded in a matter of months. Both Richards and Burnham kept repeating the mantra that they retained \"an open mind\". They will have to start making some tough decisions, and fast. In a year's time, Burnham promised the future shape of the PSB landscape would be clear - one way or another: \"I don't want to be at another Labour party conference debating the future of public service broadcasting. This is the end game.\"</p>",
  "<p>'My life is a blank!\" I identified with that comment from an American blogger when Scrabulous, the online facsimile of Scrabble, finally disappeared from Facebook last month. It was withdrawn by the Indian Agarwalla brothers, who designed the game, after legal threats from Scrabble's UK copyright owner, Mattel. </p> <p>I only played the board game at Christmas with my Auntie Marion, but Scrabulous was something else. Among its charms was the facility to check for obscure words before you played them. So if anyone questioned the validity of \"qi\" (a Taoist term meaning \"life force\"), they would look foolish. Life without it was tough. At work, I resorted to long-neglected activities such as answering my phone, and that hour usually spent letter-juggling before bed proved difficult to fill.</p> <p>But now the Agarwallas have returned, with Wordscraper. It's basically the same game, but with just enough differences - round letter squares, different bonus squares, and quadruple letter scores. You can also customise the board and rules. Already, many former Scrabulites have taken to Wordscraper like a Z to a quadruple letter score. But there is a split in the word-mangling community. Not before time, an official online Scrabble application has appeared on Facebook, and it already has half a million users. However, the average review rating of 1.6 out of five suggests few have formed a habit. \"Very slow and clumsy,\" they say. \"Yuk! Nasty graphics.\" \"Ill thought out.\" Worse still, your turns are timed, meaning if your opponent plays a word while you're in a meeting, you forfeit your turn - thus alienating the desk-dwelling demographic at a stroke.</p> <p>Wordscraper has no such restriction, and is rated 4.3 out of five. With little publicity, it already has 247,000 users. It'll surely send white-collar productivity plummeting by Christmas, to add to the economy's woes, but who cares? By then, I'll be so white hot that when I next play Auntie Marion at Scrabble, I'll thrash her within an inch of her qi.</p>",
  "<p>Human milk tastes like watermelon juice, apparently - but I don't know that first-hand, only from watching Friends. The world seems divided on the issue: two or three people think that it's no different from cow's milk, and there's nothing to stop an adult from drinking it. And everybody else, in the whole world, thinks that's absolutely minging.</p> <p>And yet, those two or three people are making a lot of noise: only a month after Kate Garraway floated the idea that all women should breastfeed each other's children, as well as each other, or something like that, Peta, the animals rights group, has asked Ben &amp; Jerry's to use human breast milk instead of cow's milk. \"If Ben &amp; Jerry's replaced the cow's milk in its ice-cream with breast milk, your customers - and cows - would reap the benefits,\" wrote Peta's Tracy Reiman.</p> <p>A Swiss restaurateur, meanwhile, who attempted to use breast milk in cooking, has run aground on the scarcity of European legislation on the matter. \"They are not on the list of approved species such as cows and sheep, but they are also not on the list of the banned species such as apes and primates,\" said Rolf Etter of the Zurich food control laboratory. So monkey milk is illegal. Who knew?</p> <p>Garraway is being deliberately controversial for Channel 4 (there ought to be a verb for this behaviour, it is so prevalent), Peta is defending animals any way it knows how, and the Swiss chappie is being really, really Swiss. So I've no brush to tar them all with, but I will point out the following: you can't just go and get some breast milk from Unigate. </p> <p>My understanding of breast-milk banks is that even having a newborn baby is not sufficient; you also have to prove that both your own breasts are unavailable - perhaps a dog has made off with them. And the reason these banks are so stingy, and have none left over for making ice-cream or poaching wiener schnitzel? Because it comes out really slowly. To get a decent amount ... well, imagine a dairy farm, only with women. </p> <p>So well done, Peta, yet another shocking image to ram home our treatment of animals, but I wonder whether there's any chance that next time you think up one of your thrilling campaigns, you might choose to humiliate men. Just to shake things up a bit. And as for you other lot: you are just silly.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Blogosphere</strong><br><strong>Voices of opposition</strong><br>The tension between Malaysian authorities and the country's raucous online media was heightened last week with the indefinite imprisonment of the prominent blogger Raja Petra Kamarudin, under security laws more often used to target suspected Islamic extremists.</p> <p>Raja Petra is the man behind the popular anti-government site Malaysia Today, which authorities blocked access to earlier this year. He has taken delight in publishing a number of inflammatory allegations about government ministers, and was jailed for insulting Islam and threatening national security through his blog. In the process, he has joined other Malaysian online voices who have assumed the role of highly politicised opposition.</p> <p>Another is the blogger Jeff Ooi, voted into the Malaysian parliament in March on an opposition party ticket. Ooi admits Raja Petra often \"mixes fact with fiction\" but points out that the 57-year-old commands a strong following. \"It's a new phenomenon, because the citizenry is now empowered by this cyber-soapbox,\" says Ooi. \"They can offer their views and often these are dissenting.\"</p> <p>The popularity of sites such as Malaysia Today, Malaysiakini and The Nut Graph is a natural response to mainstream media rendered toothless by political party ownership. But not everyone is convinced that the power that comes with being the de facto opposition media is always wielded responsibly by unlicensed websites. \"There is some truth to this,\" admits Ooi. \"Some bloggers don't understand the nature of the dissemination of information and, sometimes, reckless or unmoderated dissemination can be dangerous.\"</p> <p>Still, few seriously believe that attacking online media, or even imprisoning bloggers, will help the government out of its current predicament. \"It's pointless and counterproductive to regulate or shut down websites,\" says Ho Kay Tat, former editor of the country's Sun newspaper, who has regularly crossed swords with many of the country's popular bloggers. </p> <p>But the online movement has got backing from at least one unexpected quarter. The former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, no stranger to criticism from the media, has started his own blog. \"It is ironic,\" admits media analyst Mustafa K Anuar. \"He is getting a taste of his own medicine.\"<br><strong>Malik Fareed</strong></p> <p><strong>Multimedia</strong><br><strong>May the taskforce be with you</strong><br>The Media Literacy Task Force may have existed since 2004, but a mention of its name to most people draws blank stares. Launched by the UK Film Council, Channel 4, the BBC and the BFI, the taskforce aims to inform and empower the public about the range of media emerging from the fracturing of more traditional forms. It also counts ITV, the Media Education Association, and Skillset among its members, but other than some behind-the-scenes discussions and a handful of low-key projects, MLT appears to have had a limited impact.</p> <p>Now it has a new chair - Alex Graham, chief executive of Wall to Wall, the <br>independent TV production company responsible for Who Do You Think You Are? and New Tricks. He says: \"For a lot of people media literacy is kind of associated with a slightly arcane academic approach. I think media literacy is about a basic set of tools for people of all ages. It's seen in slightly narrowly educational terms but what it's really about is giving everyone a set of tools to navigate an increasing complicated media landscape.\" </p> <p>But given that young digital natives already understand new technologies better than most, what's the point of a campaign? Graham, who will combine chairing MLT with his day job, says he is still keen to see media literacy taught, in one form or another, in schools - arguing there is still a need for the political and social framework of the new media landscape to be understood, even if younger people are adept at using modern technology.</p> <p>However, it needs to go beyond educating children. \"The first phase of the taskforce was to win the argument with the stakeholders that it was important,\" says Graham. \"My sense is that it's been done now.\" That, he thinks, will allow the MLT to become \"a bit more outward-facing and perhaps make it a bit more politically engaged in a proactive way\".</p> <p>Arguments over public service broadcasting, Graham adds, could prove fertile ground for the taskforce. He wants to see broadcasters extend the education and training to embrace consumers across all platforms. \"We're likely to have a communications act in the next three or four years' time.

It's little wonder there's talk of a crisis in the Welsh media. Wales has \"a poor and declining voice\", says Professor Bob Franklin of Cardiff School of Journalism, especially when it comes to its print media. \"Is it a national newspaper, the Western Mail?\" he asks. \"It is shrinking in terms of circulation and journalistic content.\" (The paper's latest ABC figure was 37,152.)</p> <p>Franklin says journalists at BBC Wales have told him they already feel they are carrying the flag for Welsh political reporting because the printed press doesn't do a good enough job. The loss of programming at ITV Wales will effectively cut out any competition.</p> <p>With the majority of newspapers read in Wales written in England, and the demise of the Welsh editions, there is concern that readers are being shortchanged - and Welsh politics is going unreported. Leanne Wood, a member of the Welsh assembly for Plaid Cymru, tried - unsuccessfully - to bring the heads of Trinity Mirror, the BBC and ITV to the assembly to hold them to account for declining standards in the Welsh media.</p> <p>Earlier this month she wrote to Wales's heritage minister, Alun Ffred Jones, following news that production of the Big Issue Cymru, the Welsh edition of the weekly magazine sold by homeless people, will be shifted to Scotland, with the Welsh editor and designer likely to be made redundant.</p> <p>\"We know from the King report into the BBC that Welsh news and political issues are not reported on a UK level to any satisfactory level,\" says Wood. \"There have been jobs lost in Media Wales, BBC Wales, [and with] the Big Issue Cymru being moved to Scotland. The picture is not rosy.\"</p> <p>Jones has requested a meeting with UK government ministers to discuss concerns about the loss of regional programming at ITV Wales.</p> <p>\"We are stumbling from crisis to crisis,\" says Wood. \"Unless there is a radical response, the Welsh media doesn't stand a chance.\"<br><strong>Cathryn Scott</strong></p>",

  "<p>Aware it was never going to be the UK's biggest mortgage bank, Bradford &amp; Bingley chose to specialise. A concerted lending push combined with a policy of buying hundreds of millions of pounds of existing loans transformed the onetime sleepy building society into Britain's biggest buy-to-let lender. It won 18% of this fast-growing market last year.</p> <p>A voracious appetite for these loans gave the project a sense of urgency and concerns about the likely risks of many ending in arrears were brushed aside. \"The arrears figures show that, despite some recent reports, the credit profile of buy-to-let remains extremely strong with no increase in the rate of repossessions,\" the company said in February last year.</p> <p>With low interests rates, fierce competition among mortgage providers and house prices climbing ever higher, the buy-to-let goldrush captured the public imagination. Buy-to-let mortgages rose from 120,000 eight years ago to 1.1m last year. But in the last 12 months the picture has changed. The global credit crunch has brought with it increases in the costs of mortgages and house prices have fallen 12.7% in the last year. </p> <p>Often taking on large amounts of debt, newer entrants to the buy-to-let market now look vulnerable. Worse still, many such investments are in new-build flats that have seen the steepest falls in value. Some have halved in value.</p> <p>Last month B&amp;B said the number of its loans that had slipped more than three months into arrears had increased by 55% in the previous six months. Repossessions were up 27%. City analysts noted B&amp;B's arrears figures were double those of other mortgage lenders. Moreover, they estimate 40% of its loans could be in negative equity if house prices lose 30% of their value.</p> <p>B&amp;B has not, as yet, experienced the same kind of pressure on its mortgage financing as Northern Rock. In fact, its capital base is among the strongest of a UK bank. Nevertheless, despite a \u00a3400m rights issue over the summer, the company's market value has been shrinking at an alarming rate. At the end of last week there were growing whispers that B&amp;B depositors were losing confidence and withdrawing savings.</p> <p>The demise was yesterday greeted with exasperation by some. Peter Montagnon, director of investment affairs at the Association of British Insurers, whose members control almost a quarter of the stock market, said: \"We understand the need for action ... but it is a matter of concern that a bank with one of the strongest capital ratios in the sector should have become a casualty.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u00b7 On paper her [Jane Tranter's] record is formidable but after following the various threads on BBC drama it would appear that a lot of writers &amp; producers will be glad to see the back of her and her \"empire\" (or do we call it reach, these days?) slimmed down. Also, the title 'controller of fiction' always puts me in mind of a political press officer. sounds terribly pompous. <strong>hermionegingold</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Ben [Stephenson], may lack the experience of others but Tranter has put a solid team in place and the wheels will keep on turning for some time yet. He's got a couple of years' safety net and then we'll see if he's got the imagination and wit to move the job forwards. <strong>abelseaman</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 I don't quite get what job Ben Stephenson has got. Is he now head of drama? Which means they'll be looking for a new head of indies? <strong>sergeantTroy</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 I guess I'm disappointed that it doesn't feel as if any lessons have been learned from her period in power, and that one overall voice will once again be dictating who is or isn't in favour, as opposed to allowing genuine authority to be divided up amongst a team of creative producers. <strong>SunnySally</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Until the BBC becomes less metropolitan and more representative of the UK and the people who live there, I fear it's just shuffling the London deckchairs on the Titanic time again. <strong>TellyViewer</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 I haven't ever been commissioned by the BBC, however I do work in the business and count amongst my friends many producers and writers who are regularly employed by the BBC. And these are the people most dissatisfied with the set-up. It irks me that each time anyone dares to criticise the current unwieldy system, they are dismissed as being bitter whingers and are assumed to bear a grudge against Jane Tranter because she has rejected their scripts. Far from it, it's the people on the inside actually working with the BBC who are most despondent. If only someone in BBC drama had the self-confidence to acknowledge that the system is not perfect, needs an overhaul and that some of their critics may just have some worthwhile points... <strong>SunnySally</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 There's no doubt she's hard to replace, but if things go well, we will at last have some adult, unusual drama on television, something which will change the culture and stir things up. This has been sorely lacking in recent years and while I think la Tranter deserves many pats on the back in all sorts of ways, her repulsive lust for power and the immature nature of too much of the drama she commissioned, means I for one am glad to see her go. <strong>bondboy</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 I was only at the BBC for 9 months and actually commissioned a number of successes like Ballykissangel and that show (still running today about cold cases starring Millie Fox - forgotten title!) so I don't think I did too badly there. The place was in a hell of a mess with no one in control and it was riddled with poisonous rivalries. Jane didn't actually take over from me as there were others before her like Chris Parr but once she got established, and helped by the fact that the BBC started getting large licence fee rises as a result of Birt and Bland, the beneficial effects of a strong controller started to come through - first with some popular shows and then with quality dramas. I think it's probably time that someone else had a crack - so good luck to Ben. We shouldn't snipe at him before he's done anything. <strong>nickelliott</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 I know I'm just quoting what some of you have said already, but isn't the argument simply that however brilliant Jane is, and by all accounts she is, it's not practical to have one person in charge of so much content. (Especially someone who reportedly liked to get quite involved in productions.) <strong>notsosure</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Let's give him a chance. He's got the job let's give him a break, reading all this must be worse than a bad review from a.a. gill. So he hasn't got a really long list of credits, maybe he's brilliant. <strong>tvbloke</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 Perhaps they should rename the department BBC Friction. <strong>lcmnick</strong></p>",
  "<p>Since 2001 the United States has not, for the most part, abandoned the principles of justice set out so magnificently in its founding constitution. But many people around the world believe that it has. In prosecuting what it called the \"war on terror\", the Bush administration acted with a brutal disregard for due process, most notoriously at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, but more widely with extraordinary rendition and all the horrors that accompanied it. As a result, every threat of action against foreign citizens produces suspicion, justified or not.</p> <p>This was the background against which the so-called \"NatWest three\" bankers were extradited to the US in 2006. It is also the background today to the less-famous case of Gary McKinnon, a foolish British hacker on the brink of trial in America for breaking into military computer networks. In both cases, the guilt or not of individuals has been subsumed by a generalised alarm about arbitrary American justice. The NatWest three used this to great effect before they were convicted. Now Mr McKinnon appears to be terrified by what might happen to him if he faces an American court. His supporters, who demonstrated outside the US embassy in London yesterday, warn on their campaign website that \"the unjust treatment of British citizens (and others) when facing the might of the US military 'justice' system, which practices detention without trial in Guant\u00e1namo Bay ... is an ongoing scandal\". In a recent article for the Guardian, his mother said she worries that he could face a sentence of up to 60 years. </p> <p>American protests that all this is wrong - that Mr McKinnon faces neither deportation to Guantanamo nor decades in jail - are pointless if probably correct. Through its actions, America has got into the position where such things are believed. Through its actions, America must now get out of this position. Its pursuit of Mr McKinnon for doing nothing more serious than damaging the egos of military top brass is no help at all. He may have broken the law; he does not deny hacking into supposedly secure computers, using his cybername Solo. But he should have been charged under British law, for a crime carried out in Britain - a point the home secretary ought to have insisted on. </p> <p>He has also recently been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and obsessed with UFOs. That does not make him innocent. But it is a further reason why his case should have been handled with intelligent discretion. The US is right to seek the extradition of people charged with serious crimes - most recently the murderer Neil Entwistle. Mr McKinnon is not in this league. America's pursuit of this frightened and sorry man sets back the recovery of its reputation for justice.</p>",
  "<p>In the 12 months since we announced the winner of our first chess book award some seriously good titles have come out: four have made it on to our 2008 shortlist. First up is <a href=\"http://www.everymanchess.com/display.php?id=462\">Modern Chess: Part 2 Kasparov vs Karpov 1975-1985 by Garry Kasparov</a> (Everyman Chess), which can be considered the latest in Kasparov's series of illuminating volumes on the history of world championship chess. Like its predecessors, this book is nicely produced. It combines detailed analysis of the title match with Karpov with memoir, anecdote and score-settling. Some may think that Karpov, one of the greats of modern chess, deserves fairer treatment than he gets here. Nevertheless this is a terrific read.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newinchess.com/From_London_to_Elista-p-384.html\"> From London to Elista</a> by Evgeny Bareev and Ilya Levitov (New in Chess) brings the history of the world championship up to date (almost). Beginning with Vladimir Kramnik's shock defeat of Kasparov in London in 2000, the book goes on to cover Kramnik's defence of his title against Leko (2004) and his controversial match with Veselin Topalov in Elista two years ago. The games are beautifully annotated.</p> <p>Next comes <a href=\"http://www.newinchess.com/Forcing_Chess_Moves-p-387.html\">Forcing Chess Moves</a> by Charles Hertan (New in Chess). Subtitled A Key to Better Calculation, this is essentially a book of 650 tactical exercises, grouped by category - brute force combinations, forcing retreats, zwischenzugs etc. Hours of fun, or frustration, depending on your skill.</p> <p>Last, <a href=\"http://www.newinchess.com/100_Endgames_You_Must_Know-p-388.html\">100 Endgames You Must Know</a> by Jesus de la Villa (New in Chess) focuses on the endgame positions you're most likely to encounter: such as the Lucena (a forced win if you know what you're doing) and the Philidor (a draw, if you play correctly). In this week's position it looks as if Black will successfully defend because he can control the queening square with both king and knight. The immediate attack on the knight 1 Bd5 looks tempting but throws away the win after 1...Nd6+ 2 Kc7 Ne8+ 3 Kc8 Nd6+. The correct procedure is for White to avoid the intended knight check on d6 by playing 1 Kc7!. After 1...Nd8 2 Bd5 the bishop dominates the knight.</p> <p>We will announce the winner in early November.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chess@theguardian.com\">chess@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The government was this morning expected to nationalise buy-to-let lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>, as the global credit crisis deepened with the giant European banking group Fortis also being partially taken into public hands late last night.</p> <p>But even as governments stepped in to rescue the two institutions there were hopes that an apparent agreement by the US Congress for a $700bn bail-out for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street </a>would draw a line under the deepest financial crisis since the Depression.</p> <p>After a weekend of frenetic activity in London and Washington, chancellor Alistair Darling last night convinced Spanish bank Santander to buy B&amp;B's 200 branches and \u00a322bn of savings, but he will now take \u00a341bn of mortgages into state hands. Santander will have more than 1,200 UK branches, as it owns Abbey and is taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester.</p> <p>In the US, treasury secretary Henry Paulson declared \" I think we're there\", after horse-trading by the Bush administration finally removed opposition by both Democrats and Republicans for the taxpayer to take \"toxic\" investments owned by banks. Both presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, said they supported the package, toughened up with help for homeowners facing foreclosure and curbs on executive pay.</p> <p>The US treasury would get an initial $350bn to buy mortgage-backed securities, and sell them later for the best possible prices. Last night, there were signs the House of Representatives might vote today, with the Senate later in the week.</p> <p>The crisis spread to Belgium where Fortis, its biggest private employer, became the first big European casualty of the credit crunch. Last night a deal was reached between EU and national banking officials and Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg ministers; the three governments will pour \u20ac11.2bn into the bank.</p> <p>In London, sources said the government was not preparing any UK \"Paulson plan\", although Darling is taking on \u00a341bn of B&amp;B mortgages as well as \u00a3100bn of Northern Rock mortgages. While the outline of a B&amp;B deal was done by lunchtime, talks went on last night to try to minimise risk to the taxpayer amid fears that billions could be added to Britain's worsening national debt. An announcement will be made before the London stockmarket opens at 8am today, after a weekend trying to avoid the confusion of Northern Rock, which took five months to nationalise.</p> <p>Central banks were last night ready to inject liquidity into financial markets at the start of a make-or-break week for banking. Fears of fresh casualties last week sent interbank rates, the borrowing costs banks charge each other, soaring, and left Darling mounting the second emergency operation for a UK bank in a fortnight after HBOS was taken over by Lloyds TSB.</p> <p>The Treasury realised on Friday that B&amp;B had no independent future and tried to persuade a handful of major banks to make a full takeover. None would. Bidders were last night asked to tender to process the mortgages taken into state hands. Treasury chief secretary Yvette Cooper admitted the stability of the entire banking system was at stake. She told the BBC: \"We've been very clear the priority is to make sure that depositors, that ordinary savers, will be properly protected, but also that we can support the stability of the banking system as a whole.\"</p> <p>David Cameron last night opposed nationalisation of B&amp;B, saying it was wrong \"to throw the whole thing on to the taxpayer\", and proposed alternative methods to rescue ailing banks as well as powers to control asset-lending ratios of individual banks to avoid failure.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne will use his party conference today to accuse Gordon Brown of presiding over 10 years of debt: \"We racked up more than a trillion pounds of mortgages and credit card bills and households debts, and the government never stopped to think ... Now the credit has dried up, the engines of the economy have stalled, the party is over.\"</p> <p>B&amp;B's shares will be suspended at 20p and its shareholders left with nothing. This may anger big City institutions and 850,000 individuals with shares after demutualisation eight years ago.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/11/games.piracy\">MEET THE PIRATES</a><br>I read with great interest how Cliff Harris went from \"being demoralised by pirates to [being] inspired by them\" (Developers face up to the pirates, 11th September). True, small-scale developers can be more agile when addressing problems presented by new technologies but, as Bobbie Jonson rightfully points out, Mr Harris's tactic shows a more progressive attitude than the \"large stick and small carrot\" approach adopted by much of the entertainment industries. The film, TV and music industries are starting to see the value in 'freeconomics' and the power of sharing music and video content. Embracing P2P and social networks creates a low-cost, distribution channel that maximises the reach of your product \u2013 fans can access the long-tail of content. However, creating high-quality music and broadcast content is as costly as it's ever been; viewers need to respect the need for revenue to make attractive, viewable content \u2013 Lost is not made on a shoestring! Protected adverts that can be targeted to exact audiences generate far higher revenues, allowing viewers to download for free, pay by attention, but ensure that their favourite shows can retain their high production values. Copying and piracy is still a serious issue, it is not a new one, but it continues to evolve. It is clear that pirates cannot always be beaten, so why not join them? As other entertainment industries have demonstrated, online distribution does not always equate to loss of revenue. If games publishers were prepared to approach online distribution with the same level of innovation they bring to game development, consumers will be able to play for free while the industry continues to profit.<br>Ariel Napchi, HIRO Media</p> <p>Thank you for such a great article this should be an inspiration to other game makers and music industries aswell as those who have large budgets employing hundreds of people. Here is the way to resolve the difficaulties of piracy after all we are all wanting the best value for money for our entertainment why should it be more expensive than absolutly necessary. If only more thought were put to resolving piracy this way then only the best game producers ets would be in the industry.<br>Tom Balm (by email)</p> <p>&gt;&gt; Given changes in technology and formats, I think a nosedive was inevitable for music. The industry's fight against piracy does, however, help determine the angle of that nosedive.<br><a href=\"http://www.coolfer.com/blog/archives/2008/09/why_piracy.php\">coolfer.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Most of us know that the Internet is for sharing.

It will, I am prepared to suggest, lead to more, not less piracy. Also, following the documents one finds that the real beneficiaries were the ISPs who charged tens of thousands of pounds in fees. Not a good way to make friends - especially if you have already hacked them off by suggesting you will introduce Phorm (boo! hiss!)<br><a href=\"http://blog.david.bailey.net/blog/_archives/2008/9/11/3879973.html\">blog.david.bailey.net</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; I'm with the pirates on this, though. Most games are just not worth the price. Usually it's because they were thrown out to the market before they were what they could have been because of the time constraints the publishers put on the developers. It's not just a product, it's an art in its own right. and the fact they have to \"hollywood\" the industry for pure profit turns them into what they're not, toys. It's like rushing out a book, it just ruins the story when you have to cut content and revise the vision it was intended to be, all for the sake of $$.<br><a href=\"http://www.applegeeks.com/blog/2008/09/13/how-i-learned-to-love-game-pirates/\">applegeeks.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Seems to me if it's illegal, it's illegal.

Having seen it on You Tube I am surprised that you are so baffled by it. As you say it's a teaser, so it doesn't have to do much. Isn't it just a brand-awareness ad with some weirdness thrown in? Pretty straightforward, Guinness-like above the line promotion of Microsoft as something other than the mercenary masters-of-the-universe that most of us think them to be.<br>This is Microsoft as cuddly, fun, off-the-wall, masters of self-effacing mirth. There are several references which are not entirely clear, but it never hurts to have a thoughtful Spanish speaker, even if they do think Bill (or is it Jerry?) may be a conquistador. Jerry mentions several times that Bill is a Ten with it's (admittedly 30 year old) associations with Bo Derek, Hollywood etc - but never dis Hollywood. I'm not sure what snack they are eating, but it gives Bill the opportunity to say \"I'm good\" - how subtle is that? And, assuming it is some bread based foodstuff, the ancient Roman metaphor of keeping the populace under control by giving them 'bread and circuses' is lurking there somewhere... and so on, and so on.<br>Other more obvious themes and messages include:<br>...associating uber-rich geek, Bill Gates with the very popular Jerry Seinfeld. Just because we don't get his show on UK TV doesn't mean it isn't being aired constantly somewhere on US TV (They're still watching I Love Lucy, for God's sake ). Celebrity endorsement works - and nobody really hates Jerry.<br>...showing Microsoft as whacky, not geeky, and shows Bill as being up for a bit of self parody, foolishness and surrealist imagery, always a good move in the commercial world if your principal reputation concerns world domination. Banks do it all the time.<br>...introduces the edible computer as desirable object and hints, through Bill's adjustment of his shorts, that it is to come and presumably that it will be delicious<br>...and then associates the notion of Delicious with Microsoft and other good things in the foreseeable future, probably software, because we suspect that the edible computer is unlikely to be a big seller anytime soon.<br>.. and finally you are writing about it and now you've got me at it.<br>Being able to find some logic in the ad does not mean that I think it is the best way to spend a squillion dollars. Personally I think the advertising agency should read your last line as it sums up exactly what Microsoft ought to be doing with this campaign. I speak as someone who spent way too long removing Vista from a new PC to install XP so I could use the damn thing without having to learn a new operating system. I know I will have to address the idiosyncrasies of Vista sooner or later, unless I jump ship and get a Mac. But the thought of having to start using Vista when XP is good enough is just too scary at the moment.<br>Richard Paul-Jones, Brighton</p> <p>&gt;&gt; Chairman Bill is using Jerry Seinfeld to try and connect with real people using Windows Vista. Sad to say, the ads aren't working for me.<br>On a side note, Bill Gates is aging well. Better than Steve Jobs, anyway.<br><a href=\"http://rightonblog.com/2008/09/12/bill-trying-to-connect/\">rightonblog.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Personally, I think [ad agency] CPB could extend this campaign making it more global and show that Microsoft are listening to all customers around the world. Microsoft divide their regions into two separate areas: G7 and G29.

I wanted to take the time thank you, this is the first article I have read were someone thought outside the box (I am sure there are others but I have not found them yet)<br>Either for are against the project most articles are written and published by reporters that do not understand what they are writing about, they just want to stir the pot (Again I must point out that I am excluding some of the scientific journals that are being written on the project where you need a PhD, which I do not have, to understand). The article was nicely written and provided a fresh prospective. I have book marked your site because of this article and hope to see the same type of reporting continue.<br>Once again I would like to thank Charles Arthur and the editors at The Guardian for a truly remarkable article. Keep them coming!!!<br>Clayton Benz (by email)</p> <p>&gt;&gt; In short, from an investment perspective, the LHC could be the nexus or the springboard for the next generation technology BOOM and a great enhancer of the lives of our children and hopefully including us, if scientific discoveries arrive on time and at affordable costs.<br><a href=\"http://prudentinvestornewsletters.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-doomsday-forecasting-and-bad-news.html\">prudentinvestornewsletters.blogspot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is not the way the bosses of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Britain's biggest banks</a> normally spend their Saturday mornings. But this weekend the golf clubs were left in the garages as John Varley, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">the Barclays chief executive</a>, and his counterparts from Britain's biggest banks trooped in to the Treasury for a 9am meeting with Alistair Darling. Some of the bank execs were conferenced in as they were based too far from London to attend in person. </p> <p>As the haze lifted off St James's Park, which backs on to the Treasury, the message from the government was simple; a solution to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">the sorry saga of Bradford &amp; Bingley </a>needed to be found before the financial markets opened in London 47 hours later.</p> <p>Darling had already briefed Gordon Brown on the crisis at B&amp;B after the prime minister had touched down at Heathrow from his visit to Washington and New York. The chancellor was now asking the banks how would they feel about taking over the ailing buy-to-let lender B&amp;B. Darling, assembled Treasury mandarins and the government's financial advisers from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/morganstanley\">Morgan Stanley</a> were disappointed but hardly surprised by the answer: thanks, but no thanks.</p> <p><strong>Count us out </strong></p> <p>None of the bankers gathered around the table and patched into the conference call were ready to mount a full-blown rescue takeover. Eric Daniels, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB, was barely a week into the emergency takeover of mortgage lender HBOS. Another deal, even one as small as B&amp;B, would be too much to ask. Varley and his team at Barclays were also busy with their international expansion plans on Wall Street after taking over parts of the collapsed Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>That left Darling and his advisers to put most of the pressure on HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and the Spanish group Santander - which as well as owning Abbey is in the throes of taking over Alliance &amp; Leicester. HSBC, which had also been sounded out about taking over HBOS a week ago, was reluctant to bail-out B&amp;B, which despite its 200 branch network was not attractive enough for HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan to seriously contemplate. He is not thought to have been present at the early meeting but was contacted later.</p> <p>RBS also had better things to do with its time than take over B&amp;B. Relieved that the spotlight had been on HBOS, its near-neighbours in Edinburgh, the bank's chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin knew he would find it impossible to convince his shareholders of any strategic fit with B&amp;B. Strapped for cash despite having raised \u00a312bn in the biggest ever rights issue in the City, it would be too much to stomach for the bank.</p> <p>That left Santander which has so far weathered the financial storm well. But it too was reluctant to bid for B&amp;B outright. In the midst of taking over A&amp;L, the bank's irrepressible chairman Emilio Botin had bigger fish to fry - a potential takeover of ailing US bank Wachovia. Represented by Abbey's UK boss Lord Burns, who as Treasury permanent secretary during the 1992 sterling crisis knows a thing or too about emergency meetings at No 1 Horse Guards Road, Santander was less willing to buy B&amp;B than the Treasury had hoped.</p> <p><strong>A public-private deal?</strong></p> <p>With the possibility of a private rescue all but dead, it was time for the Treasury to activate Plan B. The writing had been on the wall for the former building society for some time and Whitehall had spent months preparing its contingency plan. Ministers could sense there was going to be little appetite to swallow up B&amp;B \u2013 a small bank with little strategic significance \u2013 lock, stock and barrel but thought there might be takers for a part-public, part-private deal. </p> <p>Under this plan, the public sector would take control of B&amp;B's mortgage book and a commercial bank would take over the deposits from savers. It was not ideal; it was not what ministers would have preferred; but last night the sense in Whitehall was that it was the best that could have been obtained in the circumstances.</p> <p>Those circumstances were the real fear that last week's calamitious collapse fall in B&amp;B's share would prompt the bank's customers to start withdrawing their funds. A repeat of the Northern Rock fiasco - avoided a fortnight ago at HBOS - was the last thing Darling wanted.</p> <p>Discussions about a long-term solution for B&amp;B had been under way ever since B&amp;B announced a \u00a3400m capital raising in May. The fundraising was a disaster and the six major banks - Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Abbey, owned by Spain's Santander - had been forced by the Financial Services Authority to take huge share stakes in the lender to keep it afloat.</p> <p>The FSA had already been holding regular updates about the lender but on Friday night Darling and his advisers stepped up the pace. With Tom Scholar, managing director of international and finance at the Treasury, taking charge of the negotiations, the bankers realised that the stakes were being raised. When the Treasury rather than the FSA takes the lead in negotiations, it means a problem has turned into a crisis, because only Darling can sanction the use of public money in a bail-out.</p>",
  "<p>As if 25 holes in the day were not enough, Lee Westwood had to go three more in fading light on Sunday night before failing in his bid to retain the British Masters at The Belfry.</p> <p>On a thankfully fog-free final day the title went instead to Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano - a win which will probably stop Westwood returning to the world's top 10 after a gap of seven years.</p> <p>Tired all week following his exertions in the Ryder Cup, the Worksop golfer was three clear with 10 to play, but was gradually reeled in by Fernandez-Castano.</p> <p>They tied on the 12 under par total of 276, Westwood finishing with a 70 to his opponent's 67, and after each in turn had made a 10-footer to stay alive, a par four at the next decided the \u00a3300,000 first prize.</p> <p>Off much the better drive Westwood missed the green for the third time in a row and on this occasion left his chip 15 feet short and missed.</p> <p>\"I just struggled with my swing all day,\" he said. \"I didn't feel under control at any point. I was pleased to be in a play-off as I felt I really hung in there.</p> <p>\"When 'Gonzo' chipped in at the 12th I think the writing was on the wall. I felt I was at the end of my tether and running on empty.\"</p> <p>His \u00a3200,000 cheque still takes him from fourth to second on the European Order of Merit, but instead of being under \u00a380,000 behind Padraig Harrington the gap is more than twice that entering the last five weeks.</p> <p>Last year's five-shot win in the same event remains Westwood's last success. He has now had 14 top 10s since then, including third place in the US Open in June.</p> <p>It was 27-year-old Fernandez-Castano's fourth Tour victory - and takes his play-off record to a perfect 3-0. Yet it was his first top 10 finish since the Wales Open at the start of June and he came into the week only 105th on the money list.</p> <p>No wonder he was still prepared to go into the freezing cold lake by the final green to celebrate at 7pm. New Zealander Michael Campbell, joint leader with a round to go, finished third two strokes back.</p> <p>Westwood and Campbell had moved clear of the field with sparkling finishes to their third rounds when play resumed at 8am. Campbell, having signed off with a birdie at the fifth in near-darkness last night, returned to make it four in a row and posted a 65.</p> <p>But Westwood, whose round had begun with three bogeys, grabbed his second eagle in five holes thanks to a five-wood to four feet on the 538-yard third, then birdied the fifth and sixth for a 68.</p> <p>They were both 10 under entering the closing 18 holes, with Jeev Milkha Singh and Fernandez-Castano next best on seven under.</p> <p>\"Cambo is a bit strange in that he either wins the US Open or goes missing for three or four months,\" said Westwood. \"But he is good when he gets in the mix of things and it will be difficult to win with him around.\"</p> <p>As for how he felt about such an early start and such a long day ahead of him Westwood said: \"I needed it like a hole in the head after last week. You just have to dig deep.\"</p> <p>It looked as if he might have an easy afternoon when he went three clear after seven holes of the final round, but bogeying the ninth - he was inches from the water there - and three-putting the 10th for par meant there was more work to be done.</p> <p>Lots more, as it turned out, as Fernandez-Castano chipped in for a dramatic par on the 12th after pushing his tee shot into the stream by the green.</p> <p>He was still one behind at that point, but a pitch to four feet on the next brought him level and they could not be separated over the closing stretch - or on their next two visits to the 473-yard 18th.</p> <p>But playing it for the fourth time in the day the crowd finally saw a winner.<br>Fernandez-Castano, soaked to the skin and re-appearing for a press conference draped in towels, said: \"I think it's probably the best of my four wins. My season was not going very well and I was starting to get worried.\"</p> <p>As for ending up in the water with fellow Spanish players ready to throw him in he added: \"I think it was payback, especialy (Pablo) Larrazabal. We threw him in at the French Open and I am sure he wanted to get his revenge. It was cold, but it just stank. It smelt terrible, as I do now.\"</p>",

  "<p>Struggling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingley\">mortgage lender Bradford &amp; Bingley</a> was tonight hours away from becoming the second UK bank this year to face a humiliating nationalisation.</p> <p>The company, which has been battered by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">the credit crunch</a>, is set to follow Northern Rock into public ownership after attempts to sell the business failed.</p> <p>B&amp;B has been locked in talks with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/regulators\">so-called Tripartite Authority - the Treasury, Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Bank of England</a> - over the potential bail-out all day.</p> <p>A formal announcement on the fate of the buy-to-let specialist, which can trace its roots back to 1851, is expected before stockmarkets open tomorrow.</p> <p>B&amp;B, which has 2.5 million customers, held retail deposits of \u00a322.2bn at the end of June - although the bank rushed to assure savers that their money was safe.</p> <p>The chief secretary of the Treasury, Yvette Cooper, also told the BBC: \"We have been very clear that the priority is to make sure that depositors, that ordinary savers will be properly protected, but also that we can support the stability of the banking system as a whole.\"</p> <p>But its army of more than 900,000 shareholders from the former building society's demutualisation in 2000 could be wiped out - with the threat of job cuts among B&amp;B's 3,000 staff.</p> <p>Parts of the business may be sold on immediately, but the firm's \u00a341.3bn mortgage book is set to be taken under public ownership - meaning the taxpayer takes on the risk of defaults.</p> <p>This loan book could also be merged with Northern Rock, which was nationalised in February after becoming the first victim of the credit crunch a year ago.</p> <p>According to the BBC, the government will nationalise B&amp;B using the special legislation passed to take Northern Rock into public ownership.</p> <p>The FSA has been hunting for a buyer for the firm but B&amp;B's shares have tumbled to a record low as turmoil gripped markets following the collapse of Lehman Brothers - as well as rescue takeovers of US firm Merrill Lynch and Halifax Bank of Scotland in the UK.</p> <p>The company uses money markets to help fund its business, but lending rates between banks have soared as banks fearful of losses refuse to lend to each other - raising worries over B&amp;B's future.</p> <p>B&amp;B fell \u00a326.7m into the red in the first half of this year amid spiralling arrears and bad debts, its former chief executive resigned for health reasons, and it lost the confidence of the City with twice-rehashed plans to raise funds from its shareholders.</p> <p>A move to cut 370 jobs and sell off most of its toxic mortgage-backed investments failed to stop its shares sliding last week.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne expressed concern that if B&amp;B was nationalised, the taxpayer would be taking on a \"huge risk\".</p> <p>\"This choice between either a private sale, which is obviously the thing you most want to arrange, or nationalisation where the taxpayer bears the full cost is not a great range of options.</p> <p>\"There should be a third option which is a Bank of England-led reconstruction where, in the end, the large institutional creditors to the bank bear the risk, not the taxpayer,\" he told Sky News's Sunday Live programme.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable added that nationalisation was the \"least worst\" option.</p> <p>\"It would have been better if B&amp;B could have been saved with a private sector purchase, without recourse to the taxpayer.</p> <p>\"But in the absence of a buyer, the Government had no alternative but to learn the lessons of Northern Rock and act decisively,\" he said.</p> <p>Potential buyers for parts of the former building society were said to include the Spanish bank Santander, HSBC and Barclays.</p> <p>Barclays and Santander - owner of Abbey and soon to complete the purchase of Alliance &amp; Leicester - refused to comment, while HSBC was unavailable.</p> <p>But shareholders were angered at the potential move. One, Jon McKnight, called it \"the most blatant case of legalised bank robbery this country has ever seen\".</p> <p>\"Surely, at the very least, B&amp;B's board should have called an extraordinary general meeting for shareholders to decide the way forward.</p> <p>\"It is customary in this country for owners to be consulted on what becomes of their property before it changes ownership. Anything else is classed as theft.\"</p> <p>Members of the Tripartite Authority would only say that discussions over B&amp;B were \"ongoing\".</p> <p>An FSA spokesman said: \"We confirm that the Treasury, FSA and BoE are working closely with B&amp;B to consider the implications for its business of recent financial turmoil.\"</p> <p>Derek Simpson, joint leader of the Unite union, said: \"We are now seeing the human cost of the credit crunch. We need action to end this crisis.</p> <p>\"This situation should never happen again, and that is why the financial services need to be regulated more effectively.\"</p>",

  "<p>Talking about decisions at the end of life is fraught with difficulties. Death and dying are taboo subjects, and most people avoid discussing them until necessity intervenes. </p> <p>This is a problem. At present around half a million people die in England each year. We are all living longer and impressive medical advances mean more of us will be diagnosed with terminal illnesses as well as complex medical conditions. As a consequence, we will need to radically address the way we care for and treat people nearing the end of their lives. Essentially we're going to have to rethink the end of life.</p> <p>The esteemed moral philosopher Baroness Warnock has attempted to do just this, but in so doing has come under a barrage of criticism. In an interview with the Church of Scotland's magazine Life and Work, Lady Warnock advocated that dementia suffers may have a \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2983652/Baroness-Warnock-Dementia-sufferers-may-have-a-duty-to-die.html\">duty to die</a>\". She said: \"I'm absolutely, fully in agreement with the argument that if pain is insufferable, then someone should be given help to die, but I feel there's a wider argument that if somebody absolutely, desperately wants to die because they're a burden to their family, or the state, then I think they too should be allowed to die.\"</p> <p>Baroness Warnock is right on her first point. Terminally ill adults in unbearable suffering should be able to choose when and where they die, within strict legal safeguards. However, she is very wrong on her second point - absolutely no one has a \"duty to die\". Consequently, when the law on assisted dying does change it will include a legal safeguard to ensure that any terminally ill adult who chooses an assisted death is mentally competent: capable of making the decision and understands its consequences.</p> <p>Of course, some will disagree - those who seek to impose their own beliefs on others and those who do not think we go far enough. However, Dignity in Dying's position is clear. When even the best end-of-life care cannot allow all terminally ill people to avoid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/16/health.health\">suffering</a> they feel is unbearable, it is sadly inevitable that some of them will resort to traveling abroad to die, botched suicide attempts and \"mercy killings\". This situation is simply wrong: we need regulation at the end of life that allows choice while protecting vulnerable people. </p> <p>For sufferers of dementia and their loved ones, the condition presents a difficult and often traumatic experience. These people need our full support. Many people are genuinely frightened of developing dementia. More must be done to promote awareness of the choices these people have under the existing legal framework. Legally binding <a href=\"http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=143\">advance decisions</a> allow people to refuse medical treatment should they lose mental capacity, but only a tiny number of us have actually filled one out. In addition the government's <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Healthcare/IntegratedCare/Endoflifecare/index.htm\">end of life care strategy</a> will go some way to improving choice, control and access to services at the end of life for people suffering with dementia. </p> <p>But what is also desperately needed is a genuine debate about our direction of travel and the challenges we face. And so, while Baroness Warnock is wrong to advocate euthanasia for sufferers of dementia, she is at least right to spark a debate about what is an often neglected, but fundamentally important issue.</p>",

  "<p>It was always possible that Google would launch its own browser, but never an obvious move: it would mean undercutting the independent Firefox browser that Google has done so much to support. A Google browser would therefore involve a bit of empire building -- adding to the huge pile of pies in which Google already has sticky fingers -- as well as stabbing its friends in the back. (As one member of the Chrome team said: \"The fear was that people were going to read this as sabotaging Firefox.\") But it went ahead anyway\u2026.</p> <p>At Wired, Steven Levy has sketched out some of the background in <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-10/mf_chrome?currentPage=all#\">Inside Chrome: The Secret Project to Crush IE and Remake the Web</a>. According to this, Google felt it needed to make a fresh start:<br><br></p> <blockquote> <p>In the coming era of cloud computing, the Web will be much more than just a means of delivering content \u2014 it will be a platform in its own right. The problem with revamping existing browsers to accommodate this concept is that they have developed an ecology of add-on extensions (toolbars, RSS readers, etc.) that would be hopelessly disrupted by a radical upgrade. \"As a Firefox developer, you love to innovate, but you're always worried that it means in the next version all the extensions will be broken,\" Fisher says. \"And indeed, that's what happens.\" The conclusion was obvious: Only by building its own software could Google bring the browser into the cloud age and potentially trigger a spiral of innovation not seen since Microsoft and Netscape one-upped each other almost monthly. </p> </blockquote> <p>Whether this is true or not is, of course, open to debate. As I've already pointed out, there's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/sep/02/isthereanythingoriginalin\">almost nothing original in Google Chrome</a>, including Levy's key innovations, \"the multiprocess architecture that allowed each open tab to run like a separate, self-contained program\" (which is already in the Internet Explorer 8 beta); and \"sandboxing,\" for which Google bought GreenBorder Technologies, and which is already part of Windows Vista. (There are also popular third-party programs, such as <a href=\"http://www.sandboxie.com/\">Sandboxie</a>.)</p> <p>Google can claim it's helping to make PC users more secure, to the extent that Chrome has any market share (maybe 1%, at the moment). But it could probably increase the security of the net much quicker just by encouraging XP users to move to Vista.</p> <p>It's certainly true that Chrome runs JavaScript much faster than any other browser, using V8 technology developed in Denmark by a team headed by computer scientist Lars Bak. It's also true that Google is highly dependent on JavaScript to run all the code downloaded by its applications, such as Gmail. But again, it's not clear Google needed to launch its own browser. Would the Firefox team really have turned down the offer of free open source code that speeded up its JavaScript by 10x?</p> <p>So one conclusion is that Google does have some sort of long-term strategic aim, and this is supported by one of the quotes in the Wired article, </p> <blockquote> <p>\"When I joined Google in 2001, Larry and Sergey immediately said, 'We should build our own browser,'\" Schmidt says. \"And I said no.\"<br>It wasn't the right time, Schmidt told them. \"I did not believe that the company was strong enough to withstand a browser war,\" he says. \"It was important that our strategic aspirations be relatively under the radar.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Naturally, Google's plans to take over all the world's information, all the world's advertising, and all the world's applications need to be kept \"under the radar\" or it might frighten the horses.</p> <p>On the other hand, Google's Android software -- the plan to take over all the world's mobile phones -- needed a browser. Firefox has not pursued mobile, so should Google have done a deal with Opera, Apple or Microsoft? Maybe not. And if it was going to put a lightweight mobile browser into Android, it would make a lot of sense for Google to offer a browser for PC users as well. No conspiracy theory is required.</p>",
  "<p>What's the two-digit number that's banned on most websites in China? It's \"64\", which refers to the Tiananmen Square demonstration and the subsequent crackdown in 1989 (it represents June 4). It sounds like a joke but it's not. It's a reality so absurd it becomes laughable, for the authorities expect to maintain harmony by forbidding this number. And \"64\" is not alone, many words and phrases are forbidden on Chinese websites hosted in China.</p> <p>So what happens if you type in one of those words into a Chinese message-board website hosted in China? Depending on the setting, you may be told by the system \"Your message contains something harmful/forbidden/illegal so it has not been accepted. Please go back to re-edit it\" or you will see your message posted with the word magically replaced by some star marks. The fact is, every message-board site hosted and registered inside China, has a \"forbidden vocabulary\" list in its administration system. I've seen it three times in different cities. Only a few of them are expletives or racist remarks. The majority are things that the government doesn't want to see, and that ranges from politics, culture, the economy, finance and art to social news. In one message board I frequent, if I type in \"Dalai Lama\" in Chinese, I get \"****\" instead.<br> This always reminds me of the huge, self-contained, closed complex of buildings at the centre of Beijing, the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/mccross/sets/72157607464027040/\">Forbidden City</a>. For centuries, the emperors living inside the Forbidden City ruled the vast land outside through a giant autocratic system, relying on the ministers to relay their instructions. The problem is that the ministers always created a false image of the world the rulers wanted to see, by filtering and blocking the reports that didn't fit this illusion. </p> <p>The autocratic ministers of our time are again trying to build such a \"Forbidden City\" by maintaining the forbidden vocabulary list, not for the emperors, but for themselves. By banning those \"sensitive\" words and phrases on the websites, they hope to create a virtual place with no different thoughts, claims, or demands other than those the government has planned: one world, one thought! Meanwhile, they are hoping that people might actually be persuaded to accept such an image, and to show the outside world that the whole of China is content.<br> The wall built with a list of forbidden vocabulary is invisible but real. Ask anyone in any government office in China and nobody would admit such a list exists. If a website hosted inside China is found to contain those items of vocabulary, the owner is asked to remove them, or the site will be simply suspended. Sometimes the host provider receives a phone call from a \"regulator\", demanding a server be unplugged. Being a commercial operator, the host provider simply obliges. To make this even more unpredictable, the list is changing constantly, and nobody knows what be on it next. Sounds scary? It is, but people in China are developing the ability to bypass the forbidden vocabulary list. China has had its doors open for a while now. The people, even most inside the establishment, know there is no way back, and don't want to go back to where we were 30 years ago. Some people in authority may still cling to the idea that somehow they can control information and decide what people should or should not see, but everybody knows that in a connected world, it's virtually impossible to completely block information.</p> <p>Language is a living thing. You can ban some words, but people keep inventing new ones to replace them everyday. For example, sometimes, for no known reason, the Chinese word \"zhengfu\" (government) is banned, so people have started to use \"ZF\", the <a href=\"http://qi-journal.com/culture.asp?-token.SearchID=Mandarin\">pinyin</a> abbreviation of it. As for \"64\", you will see \"8x8\" instead. Writers have developed the ability to discuss incidents without using any words in the list. </p> <p>Recently, a new technique has been developed that involves some software that changes the alignment of Chinese words from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts\">horizontal to vertical</a>, and it's very popular. Chinese sentences can be read from left to right, right to left, and top to bottom. For a Chinese person reading from top to bottom is not a problem \u2013 it has been like that for thousands of years, until the early 20th century. However, the forbidden vocabulary-seeking mechanism is fooled.</p> <p>When all these methods fail, people can still use mobile phones and text messages, which are not covered by the censoring system yet.</p> <p>These games of cat-and-mouse can be fun. But the serious point is that we want to express our thoughts freely, in a normal way, just like many people in other countries. Don't forget we are entitled to those rights according to the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/constitution/constitution.html\">Constitution of the People's Republic of China</a>.</p> <p>The Forbidden City is now a museum. I hope that one day, sooner rather than later, lists of forbidden vocabulary will become something we put inside a museum, just to show our children what a strange battle their parents and grandparents had to fight.</p>",
  "<p>New rules intended to prevent any more Northern Rock-style banking collapses are at the centre of a 40-page Conservative economic recovery plan published today.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said that a Conservative government would introduce a new system \"to stop debt-fuelled bubbles emerging\" by strengthening the powers of the Bank of England.</p> <p>The Tories would also change the rules relating to government finances in an attempt to prevent public sector debt getting out of control.</p> <p>Osborne said his ideas would \"transform the way budgets are made, stop chancellors fiddling the figures and protect the public from reckless debt\".</p> <p>His ideas were outlined in Reconstruction: Plan for a Strong Economy, a policy document that also summarised previously-announced Tory economic policies.</p> <p>Osborne said that Lord Burns, the former Treasury permanent secretary, was among the economists who had been consulted by the party when it was drawing up its plans.</p> <p>These are the main proposals:</p> <p><strong>Banking reform</strong></p> <p>Osborne said the Tories would introduce a new approach to banking regulation that would \"tackle the causes of bubbles before they emerge, provide proper supervision of the financial system and give the authorities the powers they need to stop individual failures threatening the whole economy.\"</p> <p>He said the current arrangements - the so-called \"tripartite system\" that involves the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority sharing responsibility for the supervision of banks - were not working.</p> <p>Instead the Tories would create a new \"debt responsibility mechanism\".</p> <p>The Bank of England would take a broader responsibility for debt. The bank would write a write a regular, open letter to the FSA setting out its assessment of the extent of risk in the market.</p> <p>The FSA would have to take this into account when regulating individual banks. The Tories believe that, if the FSA were to take the wider \"market context\" into account, it would impose tougher capital rules.</p> <p>The Tories would also offer savers deposit insurance worth \u00a350,000, to be funded by the financial services sector and paid out within a week of a bank collapsing. The current level is \u00a335,000, although the government has said it wants to increase this.</p> <p>Banks would also have to contribute more financially and through sending people on secondment to the FSA to give it more clout.</p> <p><strong>Bonuses</strong></p> <p>The Tories said they supported the FSA's decision to look at banks' bonus structures. They agreed that banks using massive bonuses to encourage short-term reckless risk-taking should be forced to hold more capital.</p> <p>The Tories also said they \"reserved the right\" to return to the issue if FSA supervision proved inadequate.</p> <p><strong>Government borrowing</strong></p> <p>The Tories would change Gordon Brown's financial rules.</p> <p>The government would still have to balance the budget over the economic cycle (Brown's \"golden rule\"). But the rule would be forward-looking, rather than backward-looking, and it would be policed by a new, independent office for budget responsibility.</p> <p>The Tories would also scrap Brown's \"sustainable investment rule\" that says public sector debt should be below 40% of GDP. Instead there would be a new rule saying debt should fall over the economic cycle.</p> <p>Under the new arrangement, the office for budget responsibility would publish a fiscal forecast before each budget. If the chancellor did not accept its assessment, he or she would have to explain why to parliament.</p> <p>The office for budget responsibility would also carry out a full audit of the nation's debts, including liabilities currently kept \"off balance sheet\" under Labour.</p> <p><strong>Support for families</strong></p> <p>The document reaffirmed the Tories' commitment to various policies that they said would offer immediate help to struggling families.</p> <p>\u2022 A fair fuel stabiliser, which would allow fuel duty to be cut when oil prices were rising.</p> <p>\u2022 American-style bankruptcy laws that would allow more time for failing companies to be rescued.</p> <p>\u2022 Abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers buying property worth up to \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>\u2022 Abolition of home information packs.</p> <p>\u2022 Specialist help for job seekers.</p>",
  "<p>It's been a hot summer in Dubai, and not just temperature-wise. Cracks appeared in the emirate's shiny facade \u2013 from construction projects delayed to embezzlement scandals \u2013 and the ruler, affectionately known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Rashid_al-Maktoum\">Sheikh Mo</a>, has decided to crack down in order to make sure that Dubai Inc will continue to prosper.</p> <p>Two scandals dominated this summer and the scale of involvement by Dubai's government points toward something close to a policy shift that will have long-term effects.</p> <p>On July 28, Lebanese pop singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/07/egypt.middleeast?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Suzanne Tamim</a> was brutally killed in her Dubai apartment. The murder trail led to Egypt, where an ex-policeman was arrested and charged with the crime. A Cairene newspaper then alleged that \"an important Egyptian figure\" had been involved and supposedly paid the killer. State authorities immediately seized on that issue and made it clear that the topic was closed for reporting. Usually, that would then have been the end of the case. A culprit \u2013 in this case the arrested ex-cop \u2013 would've been announced and sentenced.</p> <p>But this time things went a bit differently. On September 2, the Egyptian real-estate tycoon Hisham Talat Mustafa, member of the ruling party and the parliament's upper house, was arrested and charged with having paid $2m for the killing of Suzanne Tamim. </p> <p>In a country where big business and big politics are intertwined as much as in Egypt, such an arrest and charge is quite extraordinary. According to Egyptian sources, the local authorities received massive pressure from the Dubai government \u2013 and important friend and major investor in Egypt \u2013 to follow the investigation all the way through, regardless of where it might lead. Whoever in Dubai sent word to Cairo was clearly rather upset at some Egyptian big-shot daring to have his ex-girlfriend butchered in one of the emirate's poshest residences. A billionaire like Mustafa might've gotten away with such an act in his hometown, but Dubai wouldn't tolerate it.</p> <p>Tolerance, or rather the lack of it, also features prominently in the second scandal, which has continued to rock Dubai since earlier this year and shows no sign of abating. Starting in April, a number of senior managers and executives at some of the emirate's most prestigious real-estate developers and financial institutions have been called in for questioning or even arrested on charges of embezzlement and bribery.</p> <p>Corruption in the construction industry is a worldwide problem, and the Gulf is no exception. If you want to close deals, you \"facilitate\" matters through gifts. But this year, Sheikh Mo gave orders for law enforcement to investigate and, if necessary, make arrests even at the highest levels of management. In August he stated that \"There will be no tolerance shown to anybody who tries to exploit his position to make illegal profits.\"</p> <p>Among those investigated and arrested are managers from property developers like Sama Dubai, part of state-owned Dubai Holding; Deyaar and Nakheel \u2013 the company that brought us the can-be-seen-from-space <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lXclgws7n8\">palm islands</a>; Tamweel, the country's biggest mortgage provider and even the head of JP Morgan's Islamic banking unit.</p> <p>Again, a few years ago, the institutions under suspicion would've found, and the authorities agreed to accept, some mid-level fall guy, but never a high-ranking manager.</p> <p>What has changed?</p> <p>In short, today Dubai is in danger of loosing its lustre and has to work to maintain its brand reputation. Inflation is in double digits, regional competitors \u2013 like Qatar or Kuwait \u2013 are growing stronger, and India \u2013 which supplies thousands of low- and mid-level employees \u2013 is providing ever more well-paid jobs domestically. As a result, Dubai has increasing difficulties recruiting and retaining the first-class workforce it needs to make its plans and projects succeed.</p> <p>Where 10 years ago people moved to Dubai to work for a few years and make loads of money, today expats groan about high prices eating up salaries. Add to that increasingly long commutes and the fact that Dubai is (still) not exactly a \"fun\" place to live, and you get the picture.</p> <p>Next year, the emirate will introduce VAT, officially ending the \"no taxes, ever\" situation and causing many to wonder just what other taxes are going to follow. </p> <p>With all that in mind, it is little wonder that the government is now focusing on those who, so far, have been literally able to get away with murder \u2013 the rich and powerful executives and business magnates. If Dubai wants to make sure that its lower and middle management doesn't look for better opportunities elsewhere, it will have to at least show that everyone is equal before the law \u2013 because the less opportunity there is to get rich quick, the more its expats will be bothered by the inequalities that they have, until now, been willing to ignore.</p>",
  "<p>Three Chinese astronauts have returned to Earth as national heroes after successfully completing the country's first ever spacewalk.</p> <p>The trio each received a bouquet of flowers after touching down safely in their Shennzhou 7 spaceship, in the grasslands of China's northern Inner Mongolia region today.</p> <p>Mission commander Zhai Zhigang, who took the 13-minute televised spacewalk on Saturday, said: \"It was a glorious mission, full of challenges with a successful end. We feel proud of the motherland.\"</p> <p>The spacewalk was mainly aimed at testing China's mastery of the technology involved. Zhai's sole task was to retrieve a rack attached to the outside of the orbital module containing an experiment involving solid lubricants. It also proved the effectiveness of Zhai's Feitian space suit, produced by China at a cost of US $4.4 million. </p> <p>There were some tense moments when Zhai appeared to struggle with the hatch and a fire alarm was triggered, but despite these technical blips officials said the mission went relatively smoothly.</p> <p>The 68-hour operation was a step forward in <a href=\"\" \"http: www.theguardian.com world 2008 sep 28 china.space.shenzhou\">China's ambitious space exploration plans</a>. The country launched its space programme with its first manned mission in 2003, when it became only the third country after Russia and the United States to launch a man into space, followed by a two-man mission in 2005.</p> <p>Next, China aims to build a space station and land a man on the moon. Today's news has sparked debate about a new space race, especially as China is believed to be aiming to stage its moon landing before Nasa's planned return in 2020.</p> <p>For now, though, the astronauts can expect an adoring welcome from the whole country. The space walk, which was broadcast live and watched by crowds gathered around outdoor television screens, further stoked national pride a month after the close of the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>Premier Wen Jiabao told mission control the three were heroes, and said their efforts had \"put China in an elite club of three nations that have managed a space walk\".</p> <p>He added: \"The complete success of the manned Shenzhou 7 is a great stride forward for China's space technology.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I go to a shop and buy a shirt, always in the sales, I pay, say, \u00a325 \u2013 in cash. The shop assistant looks at me in astonishment. I am a shopper from the past. She has not seen the colour of money for weeks. I try to pay the exact amount, since the till is a cash-free zone and she has no change.</p> <p>Last week I took the ferry from Dieppe to Newhaven. On arrival, I was pulled aside by a customs official and questioned about my purchases in France. I had been singled out, he courteously explained, because I had paid for the Channel crossing in cash.</p> <p>The inference was clear. My cash may well have been dishonestly come by. I did not use a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/creditcards\">credit card</a> as if it were a badge of good citizenship. More to the point, I did not leave behind me a paper trail of credit card transactions. My spending patterns were those of a dodgy dealer. </p> <p>We cash-carriers are the new underclass. The surveillance society regards us unfavourably. It is surely only a matter of time before real money becomes illegal.</p> <p>This is deeply unfair. We set an example which, if it were followed, would calm the market turbulence and put an end to the financial crisis of confidence. We spend only the money that we have in our wallets and pockets and not the money that we don't have in our bank accounts. We know how rich or poor we are. We do not pay 18% to the credit card companies and live in constant fear of their monthly reckonings. We are untroubled by emails like the one I received this morning from a credit rating agency saying: \"Dear Mr M. Bell, do not be tempted to bury your head in the sand and ignore the importance of your credit history.\" That is because I have no credit history.</p> <p>We are the secret people. We come and we go and leave no trace. We cannot be the victims of credit card fraud. Our identities cannot be stolen. </p> <p>And we few cash carriers are the shoppers that even the slaves to plastic prefer to stand behind at the supermarket check out. For we pay up and on our way when they are still fiddling about with their pin numbers.</p> <p>Our time will come. Instead of being pulled aside and interrogated by HM Customs, we shall be fast-tracked at airports and seaports as exemplary citizens. The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentanu will deliver eloquent speeches in our praise, putting us at one end of that moral spectrum which has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/religion.creditcrunch\">short-selling bank robbers at the other</a>.</p> <p>We may be the past. But we are also the future.</p>",
  "<p>Now, post-<a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/conference/\">conference</a>, that he has a new lease of life, what should Gordon do? Obviously, first, stabilise the financial markets. The removal of almost all financial controls in the 1980s and the lightest of regulatory touches in the City of London since then laid the foundations for today's accelerating collapse. </p> <p>Structured investment vehicles and other opaque financial derivatives have been allowed to carry the subprime securitised contagion unchecked across the world. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/Restructuring08/idUSTRE48O01X20080925\">Credit rating agencies</a> were paid, in true Alice-in-Wonderland style, by the very institutions whose creditworthiness they were supposed to assess. </p> <p>Commercial banks acted also as investment banks without even the pretence of Chinese walls. The ending two decades ago of robust capital adequacy ratios, which ensured protection against an economic downturn, has led to virtually uncontrolled credit creation, and now hey are having to be bailed out by partial Chinese, Asian and Middle Eastern takeovers. The jaw-dropping <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUSLO34789420080924\">City bonuses</a>, which recklessly drove financial markets almost like a giant pyramid selling scheme to fund their excesses, still continue \u2013 even if somewhat abated by the current crisis.</p> <p>So what reforms should he implement? The creation of credit should be prudently controlled by requiring banks to hold significant capital reserves at the Bank of England. Exotic financial derivatives should have to be approved by the financial authorities before they could be traded, and if attempts were made at evasion by going offshore, such contracts should be made unenforceable at law. </p> <p>Credit rating agencies should be required to be wholly independent, to avoid any conflict of interest with those institutions they assess. Instead of banks being deemed \"too big to fail\" and therefore having to be bailed out by the taxpayer, they should be broken up into smaller, more competitive units, which are then exposed to the same hazards of failure as any other company (with the exception that depositors, as opposed to managers or shareholders, are adequately protected by insurance). The protection of limited liability should be loosened to safeguard the public against reckless trading. Retail banking should be statutorily separated from merchant banking and dealing in securities. <br> The City bonus culture, now attracting ridicule for its obscene greed, should be brought under control. Fancy multimillion remuneration packages, whether bonuses, so-called fringe benefits, special incentive schemes, stock options, or any other excess rewards either in cash or kind, should be required to accord with stringent (and enforceable) guidelines set by the FSA and have to be approved by shareholders' votes or preferably by both shareholders and employees. </p> <p>Rampant tax evasion by multinational companies and super-rich individuals, now reckoned to cheat the public of between \u00a375-150bn a year in lost taxes, should be a prime target for the Treasury both to restore some sense of fairness (Gordon's central goal as he told us) as well as to aid severely depleted Treasury coffers. Hedge funds and private equity partners, who notoriously pay less tax than their cleaning ladies, should be made to pay, like others, at least a third of their total remuneration package in tax.<br> Second, we need bold intervention to protect citizens from the worst effects of the economic downturn, particularly over soaring energy prices and the housing collapse. Both are eminently possible. With British Gas raising its gas bills by an unprecedented 35% and BP now raising its profits this year by 23% to a rate of more than \u00a313bn annually, leaving 4 million families in fuel poverty, a windfall tax on oil and gas profiteering is a must: popular, justified, and now endorsed by vote at conference. So is the government on the side of big business and not prepared to face down their threats and bluster or on the side of the poorest in society who will not be able to keep warm this winter? </p> <p>With housing starts now at the lowest level since the second world war and with repossessions projected to exceed even the crash of the early 1990s, a social democratic government should be prepared to take radical action to protect the fundamental right of citizens to decent housing. When there are 1.7m households on council waiting lists as well as 87,000 additional households registered homeless, several new initiatives are urgently needed. </p> <p>When homeowners are threatened with repossession through no fault of their own, the state should step in as sole or co-owner so that the occupants could remain there as rent-paying tenants and not be evicted (as the government shows tentative signs of doing, but on far too small a scale). </p> <p>Local authorities should also be permitted to build social housing for the thousands on their waiting lists (12,000 in my Oldham constituency alone) by borrowing against the collateral of their own housing stock (nationally worth some \u00a3100bn). And if this is still not enough, the house-building industry should be required to provide for low-income families at least 10% of the houses they build each year and at below-market prices that such families can afford.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Have you got your living room lights switched off? Watching coverage of the all-new Singapore grand prix makes you want to be sitting in a grandstand seat amidst the twinkling Marina Bay track, deeply inhaling the wafts of petrol and Asian cuisine, while you ponder that you really should be tucked up in bed. Of course, most of us are watching this on a Sunday afternoon over our chicken and stuffing, so I think I'll pop my sunglasses on to try and make it a bit more realistic. That's better.<br> As an unashamed Le Mans 24 Hours fan I had scoffed at the idea of a formula one 'night race' with the 3,000 lux lights turning the night-time setting into the equivalent of an overcast day at Silverstone for the drivers. But having watched the pre-race track action I'm as excited as a WAG who's just trotted into Harvey Nics clutching her boyfriend's AMEX. Yesterday's qualifying session was a visual feast, the gleaming blood-red Ferraris looking sexier than ever - and flying, too. Felipe Massa delivered an absolutely stonking lap to grab pole position by over six tenths from Lewis Hamilton, who had a serious wobble in Q2 and only just made it into the top ten. </p> <p>Last night's session did, however, highlight one of the flaws of the new track \u2013 the dangerous pit lane entrance that crosses the racing line. BMW's Nick Heidfeld, who should have been starting from sixth position, was dropped three places for impeding Rubens Barrichello by entering the pits when the unsighted Honda driver was aiming for a hot lap. Not that the Brazilian got away without penalty \u2013 he was fined 10,000 euros for failing to use the deceleration zone when he aborted the lap and dived in behind Heidfeld. So let's see how the grid lines up following that news:<br><strong><br>Singapore grand prix grid:</strong><br>1 Felipe Massa (Brazil) Ferrari<br>2 Lewis Hamilton (Britain) McLaren<br>3 Kimi Raikkonen (Finland) Ferrari<br>4 Robert Kubica (Poland) BMW Sauber<br>5 Heikki Kovalainen (Finland) McLaren<br>6 Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Toro Rosso-Ferrari<br>7 Timo Glock (Germany) Toyota<br>8 Nico Rosberg (Germany) Williams-Toyota<br>9 Nick Heidfeld (Germany) BMW Sauber<br>10 Kazuki Nakajima (Japan) Williams-Toyota<br>11 Jarno Trulli (Italy) Toyota<br>12 Jenson Button (Britain) Honda<br>13 Mark Webber (Australia) Red Bull-Renault<br>14 David Coulthard (Britain) Red Bull-Renault<br>15 Fernando Alonso (Spain) Renault<br>16 Nelson Piquet (Brazil) Renault<br>17 Sebastien Bourdais (France) Toro Rosso-Ferrari<br>18 Rubens Barrichello (Brazil) Honda<br>19 Adrian Sutil (Germany) Force India-Ferrari<br>20 (pitlane start) Giancarlo Fisichella (Italy) Force India\u2013Ferrari</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Predictions: </strong>Watching the cars bouncing along the track is an awesome sight \u2013 according to veteran David Coulthard this is the bumpiest surface he has ever raced on. It's one of the variables that could have an impact on this race, as is the curious pit-lane design, and the concrete humps installed at Turn 10. Although they've been seriously reduced after Giancarlo Fisichella's car flew into the air during practice, they are still there on the first part of the chicane and could puncture the hopes of anyone who runs over them. With 23 turns this is going to be a long and difficult race \u2013 but will we see any overtaking?</p> <p>Hamilton for one will be itching to get the jump on Massa at the start - the McLaren man's advantage in the drivers' standings is just one point and he cannot let the Brazilian streak away into the distance, especially if overtaking is as difficult as is being predicted. This race is likely to come down to the strategies of McLaren and Ferrari, but any incidents caused by the peculiarities of the circuit could lead to some tense moments on the pit walls. And let's not disregard potential podiums from Robert Kubica - clinging on into the hunt for the title - and Monza winner Sebastian Vettel who following Heidfeld's penalty now lines up on the third row.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>ITV's commentator </strong>James Allen: \"There's no credit crunch here, as Europe and America down in a tidal wave of toxic debt.\" Who said that the grand prix circus has no sympathy for issues outside their glamorous, money-guzzling sport?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The cars </strong>are on their green flag lap and all seems to be in order. Apparently the conditions are humid, despite the late hour in Singapore, and the drivers face a real test of concentration ahead of what could be close to a two-hour race. For them it's like any old afternoon though, as the news grand prix time zone has been manipulated and they're convincing themselves it's really 2pm. The weather forecast says no rain predicted, despite earlier reports of a 50 per cent chance of a downpour.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Start: </strong> Massa good start with Hamilton tucking in behind him. A clean getaway for most of the field and Massa immediately pulls away.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Lap one: </strong>The top four positions are all the same, but Kovalainen was the big loser as the lights went out - Vettel and Glock both got past. Alonso is up into 12th position from 15th at the start.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Lap two:</strong> The track is littered with leaves and debris swirling round in the wake of the cars. Alonso is hustling Nakajima, but the top four are already starting to spread out slightly, Hamilton 1.2sec behind Massa with Raikkonen a further four secs behind. Replays show Kovalainen receiving a bump from Kubica at the start.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Lap three:</strong> Rosberg having a scrappy lap and lets Trulli past when he runs wide exiting a corner - not good news for the BMW driver as Trulli is apparently heavy with fuel.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Lap four:</strong> Raikkonen is seven seconds adrift of Massa in third place - the Finn still isn't looking like he can make a late-season surge for the title.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Lap five: </strong> Trulli, in ninth place, has a stack of cars building up behind him - including Alonso in 12th who is gagging to get a move on - which is commonly known as the 'Trulli Train'</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Lap six: </strong> Well, the orderly queue behind Trulli's Toyota - and Rosberg's so-far futile attempts to get past - show that fears over a lack of overtaking opportunities at the new track were sadly correct. As Gary Naylor has just emailed to point out: \"All very spectacular, but can't Bernie use his immense power to decree that all new circuits should have at least three passing places? The result from here can only be determined by error: driver; technical; mechanical; or in strategy. Which is dull really.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Lap seven:</strong> Rosberg has made it past and into ninth place by out-braking Trulli. The only other excitement has been a yellow flag for some debris - looked like a brake duct - on track. Hamilton is 2.8sec shy of Massa and Raikkonen 8.2sec adrift of his team-mate.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Lap eight:</strong> Nakajima has also got past Trulli. A video replay shows Massa running over a piece of debris, which gets stuck under his car. Alonso takes Trulli too. Fastest lap is Massa on lap five.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Lap nine: </strong> Now Raikkonen has set the fastest lap - his gap to Massa is now 7.4secs, and he's only 4.3secs behind Hamilton. The McLaren man needs to thinking about putting on his own charge.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Mario Rustan </strong>from Indonesia has just sent a lovely email to say how proud he is of the Singapore GP. He's also been following GU Sport's pre-race coverage and says: \"So disappointed with Guardian readers' comments on GPs in Asia. In contrary to their views, Asians do really love F1. We don't care if only Europeans and Brazilians could win the race - we root for them who give us joy, emotionally and financially. From Senna, Prost, Schumacher, all the way to present time Massa, Raikonnen and Hamilton. DC should not also complain about being hungry at 3 am - I know plenty of great places in Singapore where you could have supper at 3.\" He's not the only person to have said that...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Lap 11:</strong> Raikkonen continues to make up time while Hamilton is dropping back slightly into the Ferrari's clutches. Hamilton is 3.4secs from Massa, but Raikkonen is just 3.2secs behind the McLaren.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Lap 12: </strong>Hamilton's second place is now looking far from secure. Raikkonen is only 2.6 secs behind and Hamilton has dropped further back from Massa - the gap now four seconds. Alonso has pitted and apparently seen his strategy change from a three to a two stopper.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Lap 13:</strong> Bourdais just made a lovely pirouette while Massa set the fastest lap to extend his lead over Hamilton to 4.5secs.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>Massive shunt Piquet in the wall and the car looks very crumpled. Safety Car out.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Lap 15:</strong> On the replay we can see that Piquet lost it coming out of turn 17 and couldn't avoid hitting the wall. The impact looks big but it wasn't at too high a speed. Piquet climbs out and looks fine - in fact he has to sprint across the track to safety.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Lap 16:</strong> Phew, I can calm down slightly now after that brief burst of action woke me up. This accident will not help Piquet's chances of retaining his seat at Renault next season, as a bunch of Renault-backed drivers are in waiting. Barrichello has stopped out on track. A few cars had pitted - but you're not allowed to do so until the pitlane is open. Will they get penalised?</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Lap 17: </strong>Race control says the pitlane is now open. Apparently the Red Bulls of Webber and Coulthard pitted before the SC car came out and got away with it. Blimey! Massa has made a huge error and driven away from the pits with the fuel hose attached. Is his race over?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>All the Ferrari</strong> mechanics - well, except for the one Massa run over - are sprinting down the pit lane to sort out Massa's stricken car which is trailing the fuel hose. They're having problems getting it out. Felipe, Felipe, Felipe. He gets going, but he's surely ruined his race.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Lap 18:</strong> Replays show that it wasn't Massa's fault - the green light was showing. Curiously, he came out at the same time that Adrian Sutil was passing by! So could this be the second time that the stewards investigate a pitlane incident between the pair.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Lap 19: </strong>Rosberg is leading the field, but it is likely that he will receive a penalty for pitting before the pit lane was open. Trulli is behind him, with Fisichella in third. When this shakes out it should be Alonso - in fifth - leading. SC in and we're racing again.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Lap 19:</strong> Hamilton is in eighth place and Massa is last! This could be a welcome slice of luck for the Brit. Massa may well find that his car has been damaged when he comes in to pit again.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Lap 20:</strong> Trulli (2) and Fisichella (3) are yet to pit while Rosberg (1) and Kubica (4) are looking at penalties which should leave our potential podium sitters as Alonso, Webber and Coulthard. All credit to the Red Bull strategists for their quick thinking getting its cars refuelled and out before the SC car was deployed.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Lap 22:</strong> Fisichella, in third, is holding up the cars behind... including Hamilton. The Brit is behind Coulthard in eighth place. Meanwhile, Massa is under investigation - it's a shame for the Brazilian as it appeared to be a system, rather than driver, error in the pits.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Lap 23:</strong> Raikkonen has passed Sutil and is now in 15th, but really is not in contention for a decent result. Will he be playing rear-gunner to Massa in Japan? What do you all think about that - is it an embarrassing situation for a reigning world champion to be in?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Massa</strong> has been handed a drive-through for unsafe release from the pit stop. Maybe he'll throw a few hand gestures at the team when he does so...</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lap 25: </strong>Kubica and Rosberg get 10 second stop/go penalties for their illegal stops. Given that they would have run out of fuel if they hadn't it seems pretty harsh. What a tough regime formula one is. This will promote Trulli to the head of the field, but he has yet to stop.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Nigel Baker</strong> is confused and appears to be only sporadically reading the LbL. he asks: \"What is going on? lap 12; Hamilton's second place is far from secure.... lap 19; Hamilton is in 8th place.... what exactly happened to demote Hamilton 6 places? please inform us??\" That'll be the Piquet shunt, the SC and the flurry of pit stops Nigel...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Lap 28: </strong>Oh Webber! He's run wide and dropped places... what a disappointment... he would have been running in second when Trulli and Fisichella take their first stops. The screens show he's in 14th, has he suffered a problem?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Webber</strong> is poised to retire - such as disappointment for the team and driver. Let's see if Coulthard can keep their podium hopes alive. Arnoux has emailed and says: \"There's a good hour of racing to go yet - Massa could still end up winning this race if he keeps his head (and his car's refuelling nossle hasn't been damaged). Wonder if Raikkonen can cut his way through and close back in Hamilton. Could get very exciting if Alonso keeps ahead of them...\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Lap 29:</strong> Fisichella has pitted from second and Trulli still heads the field. Arnoux is right, we're only halfway through this race. Wish someone would make me a cup of tea.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lap 30:</strong> despite taking his penalty, Rosberg has clung onto third place, with Coulthard in fourth and Hamilton in fifth. Replay shows Kubica passing Massa. This will be a race for the Brazilian to forget.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Lap 32:</strong> Massa has pitted and the refuelling kit works okay - at least that's something. Can he salvage any points? Hamilton is just 0.6secs behind Coulthard... it could be a battle of the Brits here.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Lap 33:</strong> Trulli pits giving Alonso the lead. After yesterday's qualifying when the Renault driver stood aside his broken car and screamed into his helmet it's a bit of a turnaround.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Lap 34:</strong> Trulli has fed back into eighth place. The order at the front: Alonso, Rosberg (-4.9s), Coulthard (-12.4s), Hamilton (-13.3s), Glock (-16.1).</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Lap 37:</strong> Hamilton, in fourth, is 0.7s behind Coulthard. He needs to get past and maximise his points haul now he's been gifted the situation of a disastrous race for his title rival Massa.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Lap 38: </strong>There's a neat little battle going on for the final points position. Raikkonen (10) was all over Nakajima (9), but it was the BMW who got past Trulli (8) at turn seven. Now Raikkonen has past the Toyota too. It's an impressive performance from the Japanese BMW man, but he's going to struggle to hold off the Ferrari driver, who desperately wants to take something away from this race.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Lap 41:</strong> Rosberg has pitted and rejoins in seventh - but we don't know how much fuel those in front are carrying.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Lap 42: </strong>Now Alonso pits. He can really taste this victory and his stop is smooth. He feeds back in ahead of the Coulthard/Hamilton battle. Good news for the Spaniard. A corner later Hamilton gets the place from Coulthard with a nice move under braking for turn seven.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Lap 43: </strong>Hamilton and Coulthard pit at the same time - oh, I bet he wishes he'd got past the Red Bull sooner. Coulthard has a scrappy stop almost setting off too early as the fuel rig wasn't ready to come out. He loses a place to Trulli as a result.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Lap 44: </strong>Alonso leads the race and looks very likely for the victory. Vettel and Heidfeld make their stops. The Toro Rosso driver is once again punching above his weight.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Lap 45: </strong>Once Glock (from second) and Raikkonen (from fourth) take their final stops the top three should be Alonso, Rosberg and Hamilton. We've just heard Alonso's engineer telling him not to panic! Do we think the cool, cocky Spaniard is quaking in his race boots? No we don't. He's a double world champ with an unexpected win within his grasp.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Lap 46:</strong> Looks like we might have a cute battle for fourth place between Trulli, Vettel and Heidfeld, with the trio separated by just 2.5secs. Coulthard is the big loser - stuck behind Heidfeld. What should have been a great afternoon for Red Bull has turned sour. Glock has pitted.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Lap 48: </strong>Coulthard is telling his team over the radio that his brakes have gone off... will he even score a point here? It's a shame for the cheeky Scot as he enters his final few races.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Lap 51:</strong> Glock's rejoined in fifth position after his stop - which should become fourth once Raikkonen has taken his stop. Trulli appears to be crawling around the track... a lack of fuel?</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Lap 52:</strong> Raikkonen has also pitted now and rejoins in fifth. Sutil has hit the 'water box' barriers. Another Safety Car?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Lap 52: </strong>Yes, the Safety Car out. It's bad news for Alonso, who sees his lead diminished... but it's great news for us! An exciting sprint to the end of this long race. Replays show that Massa spun at the same place, turn 18, just before Sutil.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Lap 53: </strong>Trulli has retired. Here's the running order (for points) behind the safety car: Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Glock, Raikkonen, Vettel, Heidfeld, Coulthard.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Gary Naylor </strong>thinks the turn 18 incident with Massa and Sutil was 'shambolic driving and shambolic stewarding'. It did look rather comic as it happened in slow motion. I think that Massa's was an error as he lost concentration with the slow Trulli, but Sutil was perhaps caught by water on the track?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Lap 53:</strong> At the restart... Alonso streaks away. Hamilton all over Rosberg</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>... no</strong> Hamilton drops back. Was that his only chance for second place lost?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Lap 54:</strong> Alonso pulls a 3.7sec lead on that first lap after the SC came in! Boy does he want this win. Coulthard and Nakajima are fighting over eighth place. Hamilton is 1.2secs behind Rosberg.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Jenny emails</strong> to ask: \"It appears that the Nakajimas (Saturo and now Kazuki) have never had a podium, is it in the genes?\" No it's in the jeans. It's very distracting to race in denim, especially when the keys in the pocket dig into your leg.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Lap 56:</strong> Alonso is now six seconds ahead of Rosberg... but Hamilton is just 0.7secs behind in third. Another interesting battle with just a handful of laps to go: Raikkonen is only 0.8secs behind Glock... and he needs as many points as he can muster.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Lap 57:</strong> Raikkonen hits the wall - he's out of the race!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p>What a horrendous afternoon for Ferrari. Kimi's incident was at the notorious Turn 10 chicane. Shouldn't require a safety car.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Lap 58:</strong> So our order is now Alonso, Rosberg, Hamilton, Glock, Vettel, Heidfeld, Coulthard and Nakajima in the points.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Lap 60:</strong> Alonso prepares to win after a year's drought...</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>At the flag:</strong> night rider, master of dark arts... choose whatever cliche you want, Alonso has put in a fantastic drive to win the first-ever Singapore grand prix</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Phew!</strong> That was a two-hour marathon of night-time drama around Marina Bay. We've had some thrilling grands prix this season and Singapore can take its place alongside them. At the flag, here are the finishers:</p> <p>1 Fernando Alonso<br>2 Nico Rosberg<br>3 Lewis Hamilton<br>4 Timo Glock<br>5 Sebastian Vettel<br>6 Nick Heidfeld<br>7 David Coulthard<br>8 Kazuki Nakajima<br>9 Jenson Button<br>10 Heikki Kovalainen<br>11 Robert Kubica<br>12 Sebastien Bourdais<br>13 Felipe Massa<br>14 Giancarlo Fisichella</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>What it means:</strong> For Alonso, a ray of hope after a long, hard season in an underperforming car. For Rosberg, the second podium of his career. For Hamilton, a seven point advantage over Massa in the drivers' championship - exactly what it would have been after Spa, if he'd kept his win. In the constructors' championship McLaren are now ahead of Ferrari by a single point after a truly shocking race for the Scuderia. Thanks Singapore for a gorgeous looking and greatly intriguing race.</p>",

It wasn't supposed to be like this. Tottenham are precisely no better off than they were when Martin Jol's tenure came to an end, though Ramos appears to have neatly avoided mass criticism on one of the longest honeymoon periods in recent memory. It's all well and good blaming Messrs Levy, Commolli and A N Yotherthatisn'tcalledJuande, but sooner or later the buck has to stop with the manager. Today, Ledley King and Gareth Bale are out, so comedy defending's Michael Dawson and Gilberto are drafted in to the starting XI.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Pompey, meanwhile, are far from flying themselves. Fifteenth at the start of play and with the worst goal difference in the league, Harry Redknapp's team will be looking to bounce back from last weekend's 6-0 shellacking at the hands of Man City, and the midweek Carling Cup thumping by Chelsea. Victory today and Portsmouth would leap up to ninth, above Manchester United in the table. Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Lassana Diarra, Armand Traor\u00e9 and Glen Little all return to the team.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Bonus breaking news, of a sort, dept</strong> In the wake of some Sunday press speculation about Alexandre Gaydamak's plans for Pompey, the club have released a statement clarifying that there are no current plans to seek new investment at Fratton Park. \"The club's owner has already stated that the club is not for sale but, as with all businesses, should the right offer be forthcoming serious consideration would be given to the proposal,\" read the statement. \"The financial position of the club is fully audited and is consistent with its peers in the football industry. The club's growth and performance over the last 2\u00bd years is evidence of how well the club is managed.\" Make of that what you will.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Prediction time</strong> This game has a 1-1 draw (Dawson og 13 | Jenas 76) faintly scribbled on the corner of it but, then again, I'm 2,172nd in <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">Pick the Score</a>, so a victory for either team is by far the more likely result.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Pre-match quotes</strong> \"I can't see him not scoring today,\" says former Cambridge Utd forward and now Sky pundit Dion Dublin of Defoe. \"Vat's footbaw,\" drawls 'Arry Redknapp as he tries to explain Pompey's indifferent opening to the season. \"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,\" goes the rest of the viewing nation as Sky's other studio 'expert' David Platt opens his mouth.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>\"Is Luka Modric the strangest signing of the summer?\"</strong> asks Gary Naylor. No, is the rather blunt reply: take your pick from Emile Mpenza to Plymouth and Bruno N'Gotty to Hereford. \"Doesn't Juande know that the Premier League is the most physically demanding in the world and not the place for a player who is so slight that he makes Kate Moss look like Sol Campbell?\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Final pre-match moments</strong> Fabio Capello is in the stands, and probably feeling a tad warm in his suit on a glorious day at Fratton Park. Spurs are kicking off and playing to the left, away from their visiting fans.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Roman Pavlyuchenko makes an immediate impact, leaving his stud print on the leg of Nadir Belhadj as the Portsmouth defender slides in for a challenge. No punishment is meted out, so Belhadj deals out a little retribution of his own on David Bentley. Free-kick to Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> Bentley's free-kick comes to nothing. A long kick from James ... Defoe breaks through to Peter Crouch's flick-on, beats Heurelho Gomes and wheels away, only to see the referee's assistant's flag up for offside. It was the right decision, but a close one at that.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5 mins</strong> A lively opening to the game. Sol Campbell is caught out as an early Bentley cross from the right evades his bumbling legs; Gilberto reaches the loose ball and attempts to square from the left side of the penalty area, but Pompey half clear and then James collects Bentley's subsequent whipped cross from the right.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>7 mins</strong> Richard Hughes takes Jenas down from behind, clumsily rather than cynically in a central position in the Portsmouth half. A short free-kick to Bentley comes to nothing, mind, though Spurs are looking slightly the more confident in these early stages.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 mins</strong> Now it's a corner to Tottenham: Bentley centres from the right, but Campbell booms a header out of the six-yard box. Bentley tries his luck again when he picks up the loose ball, but there's nothing doing as James dominantly collects.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> Trickery from Belhadj on the left enables Traor\u00e9 to cross, but it just drifts out of play over Gomes.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> The best effort of the game comes from Hughes, who somehow manages to get his left leg to a loose ball, driving it low and forcefully towards goal. Gomes is alert and needs to be, doing well to claw it out. The loose ball is up for grabs, but it's Crouch rather than Defoe that is closest. Almost inevitably, Vedran Corluka makes up the two-yard start given to the forward, nipping in to clear.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13 mins</strong> A nice rhythm to the game as Spurs roll up the pitch and almost get ahead themselves. Bentley, prominent in the early exchanges, breaks clear on the right, pulling a low ball square towards the on-rushing Jamie O'Hara. However, Diarra tracks back brilliantly and prevents a shot with a super sliding challenge.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15 mins</strong> Now it's Traor\u00e9 who breaks down the left for Portsmouth, with Zokora in close attendance. His low cross is dangerous and forces Dawson into a strong clearing header. Moments later, Belhadj skips past two sliding challenges in the middle of the field, before lofting a cross towards Crouch in the Spurs penalty area. Gomes is again on his toes to advance and pluck the ball off Crouch's head.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>18 mins</strong> Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto wimps out of a challenge with Little on the right touchline. The former Burnley and Reading man subsequently wins a corner, from which a looping header from Crouch tamely clears the bar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>20 mins</strong> Awful defending from Tottenham, truly woeful as another Portsmouth corner meets the unmarked left boot of Hughes on the volley. It's heading goalwards, before Gomes and Dawson combine to block the ball on the line.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>22 mins</strong> Gomes caught an innocent boot in the eye from Crouch in the melee that followed Hughes's effort on goal. The Spurs medical team are called on, as Gomes is looking like he's gone 12 rounds; his left eye is closing and will probably need further work if he is to continue.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 mins</strong> Two good chances go begging for Spurs in the space of two seconds. Pavlyuchenko volleys fresh air as he attempts to meet a cross from the right, before O'Hara's left-footed effort is weak and rolls through to James. Soon after, another Spurs corner drifts straight into James's hands, before Jonathan Woodgate bizarrely catches the keeper with a right-arm blow as he attempts to quickly release. It didn't appear pre-meditated, but it was still a forearm blow. Mike Dean dishes out a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>28 mins</strong> \"Had Woodgate got a red card for that barging of the Observer's David James (and after yesterday's bizarre refereeing, nothing would surprise me) would anyone notice his absence?\" wonders Gary Naylor aloud. \"He is the Stewart Downing of defending - inexplicably highly rated, despite all evidence to the contrary.\" It was a strange incident, but since the opening minute there hasn't been much malice in the game. Indeed, it's petering out into quite a dull game the longer the half goes.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>31 mins</strong> A good turn by Diarra deserves another, but he loses his balance on the right byline, enabling Spurs to shamble a clearance straight to Diarra. He's then hauled down by O'Hara and Pompey have a free-kick. \"Surely any team which includes Dawson kicks off at 0-1 rather 0-0?\" writes Lou Roper. \"And doesn't his presence in 'The Greatest and Most Exiciting League in the World' (TM) provide yet more depressing evidence of the actual state of English football (trademark abandoned by the FA)?\" O'Hara is booked for the foul.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>32 mins</strong> PENALTY TO PORTSMOUTH ... What on earth was Jermaine Jenas doing? Inexplicably leading with his hand as he attempts to clear the subsequent free-kick, Jenas gets a hand on the ball and Dean has little alternative but to point to the spot.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>34 mins GOAL! DEFOE PEN (Portsmouth 1-0 Tottenham)</strong> And Dion Dublin is proved right. The former Spurs striker drills his effort low to the right of the outstretched glove of Gomes. A totally needless, pointless, foolish goal to concede from Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>35 mins</strong> Pavyluchenko attempts to respond but his shot from 25 yards is woeful at best, rolling out 15 yards wide of James's right-hand post for a free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>37 mins</strong> Tottenham are throwing men forward as they try to level before the break. First up, Diarra is booked for a foul as Spurs break forward, but the free-kick comes to nothing. Then Defoe counters on the left, squaring to Little, who wins a corner. This too comes to nowt. \"Juande Ramos didn't lose the ability to manage/coach a football team overnight,\" writes George Templeton. \"Ramos' problem is that the director of football (or whatever they call it in Spain) he had at Sevilla knew what he was doing and got Ramos the players to fit his system. Damian Commolli is a raging incompetent and needs to walk, but I wonder if Ramos has the power to go to Daniel Levy and make that happen?\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>39 mins</strong> Jenas finds himself in space on the left-hand side and crosses neatly with the outside of his right boot to O'Hara inside the Portsmouth penalty area. The cross takes the sliding Campbell out of the equation, but O'Hara's touch is heavy and, frankly, very poor. The loose ball then evades Pavlyuchenko. Ramos is going to have to earn his money at half-time at this rate.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>41 mins</strong> Pressure building from Spurs here, as they win a free-kick on the left. Again, though, Bentley's delivery is not up to scratch and James comfortably collects.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>43 mins</strong> Another free-kick for Spurs on the right gives Bentley a chance to atone. The cross is better this time, but no Spurs shirt is close and Campbell's header clears the lines for Portsmouth. \"A needless, pointless, foolish goal?\" says Michael Nelson. \"No \u2026 needless, pointless, foolish team. Thankfully, I have a mate who's a Pompey fan, who can ask me again why Spurs sold Defoe on Monday. Can't wait to see us win the Championship next season \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Half-time: Portsmouth 1-0 Tottenham</strong> Three sharp shrills of Dean's whistle bring the half to a close after two minutes of added time. After a bright opening, the quality deteriorated somewhat as the half progressed, though Pompey's gift of an opener should ensure the second period is an entertaining one, what with Spurs needing to chase the game. Until the goal, there had been positives for Tottenham, but they'll need to improve vastly in the final third - and avoid breakdowns at the back - if they are to get anything from the match now.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Half-time chat</strong> \"It's so obvious what Ramos should do to turn this game and put my beloved Spurs back where they belong, hovering just above the relegation zone,\" begins Ivan Victor. \"The obvious thing to do is take off Assou-Ekotto, bring on Darren Bent, put Zokora at right-back, take off Bentley, bring on Giovani Dos Santos, move Jenas to right midfield, bring on Bent, take off Dawson, move Huddlestone to centre-back, take off O'Hara, bring on Lennon and move Bent to goalie.\" Hmm ...</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>46 mins</strong> Having started with Lennon, Modric, Dos Santos and Bent on the bench, and with Pavlyuchenko toiling fruitlessly as a lone forward, there have to be questions aimed at the team selection of Ramos. He's made a big change at the break, though. Lennon is now on, with Gilberto off after his first 45 minutes of the season. And it's now looking like Spurs are playing a 4-3-3 formation, with Bentley on the right and Lennon on the left.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 mins</strong> A swift break from Pavlyuchenko almost provides the Russian with a shooting opportunity in the box, but he's slow on his feet and a tackle comes in. But another chance comes Tottenham's way soon after in the shape of a free-kick in a central position, 30 yards out from James' goal. Bentley assumes the shooting duties, but his effort is weak, barely strikes the wall halfway up it and typifies his poor start to the campaign.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>49 mins</strong> Is there a more frustrating player in the Premier League than Aaron Lennon? Pavlyuchenko feeds him into space on the left, from where he cuts in and, in his trademark fashion, provides absolutely ZERO final product, almost shanking his cross out of the danger area. Admittedly, in Lennon's defence he is being played on an uncomfortable - for him - left flank, but his delivery just isn't up to the level it could and should be.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>51 mins</strong> Plenty of Tottenham possession in the second half, but still nothing to show for it. Pavlyuchenko rises highest to a cross at the far post, but his header misses the target by three yards, and James looked like he had it covered anyhow.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>52 mins</strong> Dawson, of all people, advances towards the Pompey penalty area, evading two very weak challenges. Eventually and inevitably, he loses control of the ball and ends up following through on Distin, giving away a foul and counting himself lucky to avoid a booking.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>54 mins</strong> After Traor\u00e9's break and snapshot from the inside-left channel is well saved by James, Spurs have a loud shout for a penalty turned down by Dean. Lennon tricked himself to the byline on the left and his cross struck the arm of Diarra. It was one of those decisions that really could have gone either way: you're either of the opinion Diarra couldn't get out of the way, or, like me, of the view that Diarra's hands were lazily being held above his waist in a dangerous area. Tough on Tottenham, but when you're bottom of the league, etc and so on.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>56 mins</strong> On the frustrating players tip, \"Everton have about 18 this season with Yakubu at the front of that queue,\" notes Gary Naylor. Count yourself lucky the Toffees aren't bottom of the table.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>57 mins</strong> A second substitution from Ramos, as Giovani comes on to replace Zokora. Traor\u00e9's shot apart, Pompey haven't looked threatening at all in this second half, but they've done all they need to do thus far and more space is opening up for their counter attacks.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 mins</strong> Assou-Ekotto has his pocket picked by Little on the right touchline and the Spurs defender compounds his mistake with a needless foul. Little's cross is low on pace, though, and Spurs eventually clear their lines. That's the end of Little's afternoon as substitute John Utaka takes his place.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>63 mins</strong> Good work from Giovani and persistence from Corluka combine to provide a cross to the far post: Lennon lays it off to Bentley on the edge of the penalty area, but he scuffs his effort and the ball is easily cleared.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>65 mins</strong> The yellow right boot of Bentley drills a flat free-kick into the Pompey penalty area. Pavlyuchenko is closest to the ball and stretches a boot to the ball, but merely directing it over the bar. A tidy flick from Bentley then almost releases Pavlyuchenko, but the covering defender Distin is able to concede the corner.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>68 mins GOAL! CROUCH (Portsmouth 2-0 Tottenham)</strong> After failing to create anything from their corner, Spurs are forced on to the back foot. A long ball is controlled by Defoe and he spins far too easily away from Dawson. The defender's concrete slippers can't catch up with Defoe, who squares to Traor\u00e9, who in turn drills a low shot goalwards from 15 yards. Gomes blocks well, but the ball pops up off his body and Crouch follows up well to nod into an unguarded net.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>70 mins</strong> \"Going down, going down, going down,\" rings out the chant around Fratton Park, as Spurs seek to salvage something, anything from this latest horror show. Pavlyuchenko gets a half-chance after evading Distin's tackle, but as he cuts on to his left foot, he enables Campbell to gain half a yard and block the shot.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>72 mins</strong> Another needlessly conceded free-kick by Portsmouth, again in a dangerous position, just right of centre. O'Hara takes over shooting duties from Bentley, but his left-footed effort flies just over the angle of post and bar.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>73 mins</strong> Bottom of the table, two goals down and with 17 minutes left, Ramos opts against taking a gamble with his final substitution: Bent for Pavlyuchenko.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>75 mins</strong> Pompey will play a good deal better than today and lose this season, but they have defended competently and taken advantage of their chances when they have come their way. They are also happy to grant Bent space on the left of the penalty area, from where he keeps his head down and drills a shot 20 yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>78 mins</strong> This isn't getting any better from Spurs as Bent is adjudged to have been just offside as Pavlyuchenko slide-rules a ball behind the square Portsmouth defence. You probably don't need me to tell you that Bent then screws his futile shot wide from 12 yards.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>79 mins</strong> A booking for Crouch, who catches Dawson with his elbow in an aerial challenge, then hoofs the ball away. Arguably two bookings, but it appears the yellow was for petulance, rather than the challenge. Meanwhile, Bentley has picked up a knock to his nose, forcing him to change his bloody shirt to a nameless one, bearing the No50. The number of times Spurs overpaid for him, perhaps?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>82 mins</strong> Another yellow card for Portsmouth, their fourth, as Hughes catches the advancing Giovani. A tired challenge, rather than a cynical one, not that it matters too much after Spurs waste yet another free-kick drifted aimlessly into the Portsmouth penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 mins</strong> Glen Johnson ghosts past O'Hara and Assou-Ekotto, who simply gives up the chase. The full-back breaks down the right, cuts in on to his left foot, but drives a 20-yarder tamely over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 mins</strong> It's come to this: Dawson again is given the responsibility of breaking forward for Spurs, but he flicks a pass with the outside of his right boot to ... no one, as every other Tottenham player is to the left of him. Spurs need putting out of their misery, and soon.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>87 mins</strong> Brilliant save from James to deny Lennon and Spurs a lifeline. The winger cut in from the left and shot from 18 yards. It was curling deliciously towards the far corner until a fingertip on the left hand of James glanced it around the post.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>88 mins RED CARD! DIARRA</strong> Spurs' corner comes to nothing and Diarra, arguably Portsmouth's man of the match, speeds away on the break down the left. However, he over-runs the ball and, frustrated, lunges as the covering defender clears. No contact is made, but it was a foul and probably a booking. Either way, it's Diarra's second and Dean's itchy fingers brandish a red and send the midfielder off.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90 mins</strong> Defoe is replaced by Kaboul, receiving an ovation from all four sides of the ground. Four minutes of injury-time are signalled for. Lennon attempts to take advantage of the 11 v 10 situation, but his weak shot is going wide before James falls on it.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+3</strong> Despite their superior numbers, Tottenham can't get hold of the ball. This is getting humiliating. Spurs eventually win it back, but Jenas' attempted through-ball is over-hit and worthless.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Full-time: Portsmouth 2-0 Tottenham</strong> Lennon pulls Utaka back on the right flank and receives a yellow card for his troubles. And with that, another game bites the dust for Spurs: six league games and no wins. Neither side shone too brightly today, but as mentioned before, they did all they needed to do. Next up for the basement boys of White Hart Lane are Hull, then six-pointers against Stoke (a) and Bolton (h), before making the trip to ... Arsenal. Next up is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/28/premierleague.wiganathletic\">Wigan v Man City</a>, with Howard Swains. Thanks for all your emails, James.</p>",
  "<p>Valentino Rossi clinched his sixth MotoGP title after claiming a fifth consecutive race victory at the Japanese grand prix.</p> <p>Championship rival Casey Stoner, who won his maiden MotoGP title at the A-Style grand prix of Japan last year, finished second, with Danny Pedrosa third and pole sitter Jorge Lorenzo fourth.</p> <p>Rossi's 70th premier class victory handed him an unassailable 92-point lead ahead of the final three races of the season in Australia, Malaysia and Valencia. Starting on the second row, Fiat Yamaha rider Rossi knew he would secure the crown with a podium finish, while Stoner had to win to keep the title race going until next weekend on home soil in Australia and hope the Italian finished without a point.</p> <p>But after Rossi moved up to third by passing Nicky Hayden with 22 laps remaining to go behind Stoner, he always looked in control.

In my career I have been lucky and have won some hard championships \u2013 like the first with Yamaha in 2004 \u2013 but this one I maybe tried to put more effort in outside of the races to try and win. I have to thank everyone at Yamaha for their efforts this year, the M1 has been very fast and we have worked very hard every weekend. Today was a great battle and a great race, and to win the championship with a race win is fantastic.\"</p>"
