  "<p>When it comes to dying, few of us want to think about it until we have to. But, as Debbie Purdy's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/ms-sclerosis-purdy\">unsuccessful challenge</a> to the law on assisted suicide shows, there is a contradiction at the heart of British law which causes a desperate dilemma for many thousands of people and their loved ones facing the reality of death. </p> <p>If any of us were asked whether we would want to have options and dignity at the end of our lives, I am sure we would all agree that we would. Yet options and dignity can be in short supply at the very time it matters most. </p> <p>Consider for a moment that someone very close to you has a terminal illness. Doctors have been clear about what will happen. They will gradually lose their faculties, their symptoms will worsen and their quality of life is likely to deteriorate. What are the options? </p> <p>One: access to services. You'd want them to have access to the best possible care and treatment. However, at present the provision of good quality palliative care is patchy and varies enormously across health settings. </p> <p>Two: control. It is crucial that dying people have control over their care and treatment, whether their last days and months are spent in a hospital, a care home, a hospice, or at home. This control extends from the \"big\" things such as refusing treatment, to the seemingly \"small\" but often equally important things such as having your favourite music to hand.</p> <p>Three: the ultimate decision. If somebody feels their suffering has become unbearable they should have the option to choose when they die, within strict safeguards. </p> <p>And here is the tragic dilemma. Medically assisted dying is illegal in the UK. So either the doctor <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/background_briefings/euthanasia/331263.stm\">does it surreptitiously</a>, as around 900 a year already do, or we go to a foreign country. Both options leave people vulnerable and open to prosecution, either medical professionals or individuals.</p> <p>In Debbie Purdy's case, she wants the option to travel to Switzerland where assisted dying is legal. But because assisting suicide is illegal in the UK, her husband faces the prospect of up to 14 years in jail if he helps her. But helping her into a taxi, packing her bags and travelling with her to a foreign country, what constitutes assisting suicide?</p> <p>Yet, despite <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4863771.ece\">100 Britons</a> having gone to Dignitas, no one has ever been prosecuted. So, although the law knows assisting suicide is illegal, where compassion and choice comes in, there is a tacit acceptance that the law doesn't fully apply.</p> <p>Debbie doesn't want to go to Dignitas with even the slightest possibility that her husband will face jail. Debbie enjoys life. But she may decide to die early. In her case, because the law is unclear, her life may end before it has to which is preposterous. She and her husband deserve clarity.</p> <p>As Debbie has now lost her case, the confused status quo will remain. People will continue to help their loved ones to go abroad to die. Doctors will continue to exercise compassion to gently send their patients to sleep. Some loved ones will discuss the awful prospect of helping their partner to die at home. All will be wrong in the eyes of the law. All will be open to prosecution.</p> <p>Logic, clarity and honesty say that this is wrong. It is time for an open debate about this issue. If the law is unclear on assisting suicide on grounds of compassion then it must change. We know that Debbie will exhaust all the legal options available to her. However, it has been made clear both in the judgment handed down and by the director of public prosecutions that this is now an issue for parliament. </p> <p>We believe that the public pressure behind this issue and the confusion that exists in the interpretation of the law on assisted suicide means that this is where the debate must go from here. Some on the extreme fringes of this argument say that, if the law changes, people will choose to end their lives early so as not to be a burden on their relatives. If someone feels this way, they can do this now.</p> <p>Opponents say that it would have allowed Harold Shipman to get away with his terrible crimes. Wrong. Evidence from countries where assisted dying is legal demonstrate it actually provides better security for patients than where it is banned. Regulating this area would lead to checks and cross checks, the requirement for discussion and consent, the involvement of more health professionals, counsellors and agencies. People such as Shipman would not be able to operate alone. Both patients and doctors would be safer. </p> <p>A change in the law would protect the vulnerable. It would clarify the position for the medical profession. It would end so-called mercy killings. At a stroke, it would sweep away those tragic, awful dilemmas felt by people like Debbie Purdy and her husband every day of every week. It is one option among others, including universally available high-quality palliative care, to which we should have a right.</p> <p>Nobody wants to be forced to confront their death but when we do, we should have the right to options and clarity. We should all have access to high quality palliative care wherever we live. We should all have the option to die surrounded by our relatives at home. And we should also know that loved ones and doctors are not open to prosecution for complying with our wishes.</p> <p>And, yes, we should have the option to go when we choose, competent and able to function with dignity as a human being.</p>",
  "<p>The jury's finding on Alaskan senator <a href=\"http://stevens.senate.gov/public/\">Ted Stevens</a> brings the conviction rate among US senators to 5%, which, if all the perps were incarcerated, would be even higher than the imprisonment rate for the hoi polloi in the country they have been ruling. However, Stevens is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/washington/31stevens.html?ref=politics\">unlikely to go down for his sins</a>. And there should be a lot more than five senators in the penalty box.<br> The sins for which the jury convicted Stevens seem very minor in the scale of things. Accepting a quarter of a million dollars worth of home improvements from an oil contractor in a fit of absentmindedness actually pales in comparison with his real depredations whose nature only differed in degree from his colleagues in the Congress.</p> <p>It is very difficult for Europeans to understand why it is perfectly fine to do hugely expensive political favours, of the kind that festooned the $700bn bail-out bill, in return for contributions to political campaigns, but it is beyond the pale to accept a few <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7636041.stm\">personal sweeteners to enhance home comforts</a>. They both smack of bribery and corruption.<br> When Clinton took $500,000 from the CEO of <a href=\"http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Transnational_corps/ChiquitaBanana.html\">Chiquita Brands</a> and within weeks launched a hugely expensive trade war with Europe over Caribbean bananas, British negotiators were bemused when their American counterparts disclaimed any connection between the two events. </p> <p>It was self-evident what had happened even if there had not been a recidivist Clintonian pattern \u2013 like kissing up to Scientology in return for Hollywood contributions, or selling policy on Cuba in return for $275,000 from the Cuban exiles in Miami. <br> Stevens is as popular in Alaska as only someone could be who has doubled federal spending in his state to $10bn a year. Hell, he was even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YptTFDsktVQ\">popular with Sarah Palin</a> despite her current desire to keep a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/opinion/29wed2.html?ref=opinion\">leper's leap away from him</a>. </p> <p>Relatively small contributions to campaigns unleash astronomic amounts of dollars that do not really count because the federal treasury is seen as a bottomless pit of other people's money \u2013 except when someone suggests it should go to children's health care, poverty alleviation, education or some other such morally debilitating purpose.</p> <p>It is almost a truism that if a state's representatives preach low taxes and fiscal restraint, then they will be dipping the till regularly filled by the taxpayers of the states whose representatives they scorn as tax and spenders. <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/10/3/122716/897/380/618991\">Hardy self-reliant</a>, Alaska, the steady top of the league for per capita federal spending, and with little or no local taxation except on the oil industry, depends on the kindness of strangers below the Canadian border to a degree that almost makes it an honorary constituent of the revived and until recently triumphant confederacy. <a href=\"http://bulletin.aarp.org/states/ak/articles/economist_says_alaska_could_feel_affect_of_reduced_federal_spending.html\">One third of all jobs and personal spending</a> in Alaska come care of the taxpayers and tax-and-spend voters down below.</p> <p>In the Alaskan capital of Juneau earlier this year, my hosts proudly showed me the local hotel where federal wiretaps nailed local politicians for corruption \u2013 and it was that probe that caught Stevens in a collateral conviction. Interestingly, there have even been academic studies <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/u2855571t8747208/\">showing that</a> \"larger federal transfers are associated with higher rates of conviction for abuse of public office, supporting the theory that soft-budget constraints created by federal transfers are potentially problematic\".</p> <p>In other words, where there is free money, politicians will take it, and between oil and federal largesse, Alaska is full of it.<br> In the 18th century, British politics was about gaining control of the treasury and looting it to pay off your supporters. American politics, from the same roots, skipped the reforms, and is in fact, as Tony Blair demonstrated, re-importing the old model. It would be a stretch to wear badges proclaiming \"Stevens is innocent\", but one cannot help thinking that his felonies are mere peccadilloes in the broader, thoroughly corrupt scheme of things. How many schools, how much children's health insurance could Stevens's $300m million \"Bridge to Nowhere\" (that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13818.html\">Palin supported</a> before she didn't) have paid for? <br> One can only hope that Obama has the integrity to welsh on all or some of the obligations his many corporate donors may feel were attached to their cheques.</p>",

  "<p>The decade and a half of New Labour in the UK and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats\">New Democrats</a> in the States, of Blair and Clinton, finally made explicit the exhaustion and dilution of social democracy and progressive liberalism. Rather than lament this fact, Blair and Clinton, danced with glee on the grave of the conventional shibboleths of the centre-left. </p> <p>Now that New Labour and the New Democrats have passed into history, some think we can get back to our old ways and re-start the great moving-left story.</p> <p>Whether sadly or not, we can't just go back to where we thought we once were before we were so rudely interrupted by Blair and company. New Labour was only possible because of a long-term crisis in Labour, its politics and appeal. </p> <p>Labour used to define and think of itself via a number of galvanising and mobilising stories and myths. These allowed activists and members, and even in the past, government ministers, to believe that they were part of a bigger, transformative project, and one which made all the compromises worthwhile.</p> <p>First, there was the <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement \"> story of the Labour movement</a>, a progressive coalition for change, which brought together trade unions comprising working people who supported a more equal society. Second, was the vague idea of <a href=\" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/551569/socialism \"> socialism</a>, never clearly defined, so as not to alienate the more practical trade union wing, but nevertheless, constantly cited and invoked.</p> <p>Then there was the story of the state. Labour viewed the state as \"neutral\", influenced by <a href=\" http://fabians.org.uk/publications/extracts/120-years-of-fabianism\">Fabianism</a> which valued the role of the expert and planner. The state could be an arbiter, shaper, leveller and liberator, redistributing from rich to poor, whether it be at the level of individuals, communities and regions. </p> <p>Finally, there was the idea of Britain and a British story. From Wick to Cornwall, this story gave working people the hope and belief that Britain was a progressive story centred on lifting people out of poverty and dead-end jobs, and offering the prospect of greater knowledge and opportunity to the next generation.</p> <p>These four pillars were cracking and falling apart long before New Labour appeared on the scene; New Labour merely stamped and humiliated them into the dirt. What comes next will be shaped and determined by the collapse of the four pillars of the house of Labour.</p> <p>A number of avenues are possible from the debris. First is the Brown approach to try to keep the big tent viable as long as possible. Thus, Brown wants to breath new life into sentimental talk of the \"Labour family\", invoke a progressive consensus, see a pivotal role for an enlightened state, and go on about Britishness as the new glue holding it together.</p> <p>Second, is the New Labour Stage Two project associated with <a href=\" http://www.progressonline.org.uk/consultations/challenge/ \">Progress</a> and others which amounts to the \"new conservativism\". This group \u2013 Milburn, Byers and Mandelson \u2013 cannot change the old record of going on about the concerns of business, labour market flexibility, and the need for Britain to remain competitive in the age of globalisation. Brown wants to keep this perspective in the tent pissing in, rather than outside, as seen in the recent appointment of Mandelson and his comments about postponing the introduction of parental rights to help business in these difficult times.</p> <p>The third possibility starts from acknowledging the cul-de-sac New Labour has taken us into. Any new kind of progressive politics after Blair and Brown is going to have to address the terrain they left: the hollowing out of Labour and the dilution and demeaning of social democracy at the hands of neo-liberalism. </p> <p>Any new progressivism has to think differently about the state and the nation from New or Old Labour. The command and control state of <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Morrison \">Herbert Morrison</a> and his grandson, Peter Mandelson, is surely now completely discredited. And the old British story can no longer plausibly continue, in light of two decades of corporate power and a disastrous foreign policy fighting two losing wars. Brown and the Blairite last guard don't even recognise the problem in these terms.</p> <p>We should look for a new political project which makes explicit the links between our economy, society and democracy, and charts a way out of our atrophied, deformed political system. What we need to do is look at how we democratise our politics, state and make the connections between this and how we think of the economy.</p> <p>Can Labour contribute to this project, or are they part of the problem? Is such a project beyond the Westminster political classes, who with honourable exceptions have proven themselves craven and impotent in the face of the neo-liberal juggernaut?</p> <p>A new political era is beginning as the old neo-liberal order falls apart. All across the world, from the US presidential elections to the UK, Europe, Latin America and elsewhere, people are looking for a way out of the debris, chaos and deceit of the neo-liberal era. It is going to be messy in Britain, given its near-total dominance of politics, business and the media, but the fightback has begun. </p> <p>It would be a wonderful, positive outcome if Labour could find a voice and soul again which was not part of the orthodoxies and problems created these last two decades.</p> <p><em>\"After New Labour\", the second debate in the \"Who owns the progressive future?\" series, organised by Comment is free and <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\">Soundings journal</a>, will take place in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339194016\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Britain is joining a growing international diplomatic effort to end the interminable conflict in eastern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo\">Congo</a> with the foreign secretary, David Miliband, expected to fly to Goma tomorrow amid increasing questions about the effectiveness of the United Nations peacekeeping mission there.</p> <p>Miliband is travelling with his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, to the beleaguered east Congolese town as well as Congo's capital, Kinshasa, and neighbouring Rwanda. They are following in the footsteps of the top US envoy for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, as the EU considers sending forces to the area and the UN appeals for more troops for what is already the largest peacekeeping force in the world.</p> <p>But the visits come amid concern that UN peacekeepers in eastern Congo are effectively fighting a war that government forces are fleeing and in doing so are siding with extremist Hutus responsible for the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/31/congo-united-nations\">Critics of the UN operation</a> - and some of its own staff - say the mission is complicating efforts to reach a peace settlement because, instead of pressing the disarmament of all major rebel groups, the UN has effectively taken sides against the Tutsi rebel leader, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/30/congo1\">Laurent Nkunda</a>, on behalf of a government whose own forces are deeply implicated in human rights abuses and more interested in making money from gold smuggling than fighting. The government's army is also allied with exiled Rwandan Hutu rebels.</p> <p>But UN officials in Congo privately say they have been left by the major powers to do an impossible job because of lack of international political will to confront the causes of more than a decade of conflict that has claimed about 5m lives, mostly from disease, and left more than one million as refugees.</p> <p>As tens of thousands fled the latest upsurge in fighting this week, people vented their anger at the UN's inability or failure to fulfil its basic mandate of protecting civilian lives.</p> <p>Residents of Goma stoned UN compounds in the town as Nkunda's forces marched toward the town and government forces fled. Refugees pelted UN convoys with rocks, critically injuring an Indian army officer.</p> <p>In response, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon said peacekeepers in Congo are \"doing everything possible to protect civilians and fulfil their mandate in untenable circumstances\". One UN official said untenable meant that peacekeepers were expected to fight when the government's own army will not.</p> <p>Alan Doss, the UN envoy to Congo, said the peacekeepers have served with \"really great distinction\" but that there are not enough of them to fulfil the mandate of protecting the civilian population.</p> <p>The UN has 17,000 troops in Congo. About one-third of them are in North Kivu, the most conflict-riven province, mostly from India.</p> <p>But critics say that more troops are not the answer because the UN has been given a role it cannot fulfil and has become deeply compromised as a result.</p> <p>Neil Campbell, a researcher for the International Crisis Group who recently visited Goma, said it was never feasible to expect the UN to protect civilians outside of a few urban areas given the vastness of eastern Congo and the array of armed groups preying on people.</p> <p>\"The UN has been projected as the body that's going to bring democracy and stabilisation to the north east of Congo which is completely unrealistic,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The problem is the UN has been forced in to fighting by the disintegration of the (government's) army. When I was in Goma, the sense of a lack of discipline and any kind of military cohesion within the armed forces is incredible. This is what you can see has happened in the last few days. It's really been the armed forces that have been running away from the rebels, so the UN has been forced into a role that it wasn't supposed to be taking.\"</p> <p>After the failure of UN peacekeeping during the Rwandan genocide, the mission to Congo was given a strong mandate to use as much force as deemed necessary to protect civilians. But that has done little to prevent staggering human rights abuses.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch has criticised the UN not only for failing to prevent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/congo.humanrights\">systematic rape </a>across eastern Congo, where it is effectively a weapon of war and terror, but also for remaining virtually silent about such crimes against humanity.</p> <p>Instead, the UN has concentrated on trying to prevent the various rebel groups from taking over major towns. But in doing so it has been drawn in on one side of the conflict on the grounds that it was defending a democratic government in Kinshasa.</p> <p>But that role was compromised because government forces were often responsible for their own human rights abuses, including murder and rape, and are heavily involved in making money from illegal mining operations.</p> <p>Global Witness recently accused sections of the Congolese army of mining gold and tin in league with the Rwandan Hutu rebel group, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders are heavily implicated in the 1994 genocide.</p> <p>Some UN peacekeepers have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mining trade and gold smuggling.</p> <p>Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, has also been protecting the FDLR, which controls large parts of eastern Congo, because its forces have proven more willing to fight than his own troops and have gone into combat against Nkunda who has had the backing of Rwanda, at least in the past.</p> <p>All that has left UN forces fighting with, and effectively protecting, not only the illegal mining trade but forces responsible for mass murder in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p>UN officials also privately accuse the Congolese army of forcing peacekeepers into action by attacking Nkunda's men forces and then retreating, leaving the UN to defend positions.</p> <p>Campbell says the scramble for control of lucrative mines remains a driving force behind the conflict.</p> <p>\"Everyone is gaining something from the North Kivu crisis, political or economic interests. There's active collaboration between the army and the FDLR. At the moment the army appears to be doing more of this business activities with the FDLR than actually functioning as the army itself,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Nkunda presents himself as being the protector of the Tutsis in North Kivu. He's nothing of the sort. He's not a freedom fighter, his primary goal is economic and political interests. He's supported by Tutsi businessmen in Goma that are using him for their ends. The areas he controls contain mining concessions they receive funds from.\"</p> <p>\"At this stage it's not additional troops that's going to protect civilians. It's international political pressure on Rwanda and Kinshasa to pull Nkunda and the FDLR back and to get the peace agreements underway,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>There is a lot of talk about talk with the Taliban in the air. From Washington, London, Peshawar, Kabul, Islamabad and Mecca over the past three weeks we have had news <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&amp;sid=aUhZCf2aqF6w&amp;refer=canada\">reports</a> on \"contacts\" between Taliban, Afghan, Pakistani and US representatives about a negotiated solution for the fighting in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Most sources agree that these amount to little more than \"putting out feelers\", \"testing the water\", and \"making contacts\". In diplomatic-speak this activity appears have the urgency for which the Spanish concept of ma\u00f1ana would be an exaggeration.</p> <p>For what are the talks aimed at, what kind of Afghanistan do they hope to achieve and in what time-frame? And where's the plan, the strategy, to get this?</p> <p>This appears to have been the message at a forum convened at the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/washington/31policy.html?ref=us\">Army and Navy Club</a> close to the White House two weeks ago \u2013 details of which have just emerged this morning in the New York Times. Delegates included Kai Eide, the UN Special representative in Kabul, and the former US commander in Afghanistan, General Karl Eikenberry. For two days they briefed security advisers to Barak Obama and John McCain.</p> <p>Their message was blunt: whoever is sworn in as the next president on January 20 next must have a clear plan for Afghanistan will be too late as security through key parts of the country continues to \"spiral down\".</p> <p>The new American Central Command chief, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jIqM8xB-dQ00_EEBzbY5b56fVapg\">General David Petraeus</a>, has proposed a surge of a further 20,000 American troops, hoping that will fix security in Afghanistan as he says his surge of 35,000 extra forces did in Iraq last year.</p> <p>But Afghanistan is a whole different tactical ball game from Iraq, from terrain to enemy strengths and tactics and the abilities of the host government forces. The famous Petraeus surge trick may not work twice. </p> <p>On Tuesday this week the Foreign Secretary David Miliband and the new Defence Secretary John Hutton, flanked by advisers, discussed Iraq and Afghanistan before the combined defence and foreign affairs committees of the House of Commons for some two and a half hours. </p> <p>The testimony was precise and detailed, but in the end amounted to little more than wondering out loud.</p> <p>They speculated about the outcomes of the three elections next year in both countries. They wondered what the shape of future governance in Kabul might be. They pondered how to tackle the narco-crime-terrorist economy. There were dark mutterings about Pakistan. This included a wonderful bit of wishful thinking about \"getting the Pakistan army to concentrate on the battle for Afghanistan, and not their preoccupation with India\". One wonders what particular planet the policy advisers at the FCO and MoD were on when they came up with that line.</p> <p>The day after, Wednesday, the MoD announced an emergency \u00a3700m package to buy a range of 700 new vehicles designed to resist the new generation of mines and remotely triggered bombs being used by the Taliban. These include mine removers, armoured diggers, recce vehicles, personnel and ammunition carriers. The Americans are placing a similar order with Oshkosh and Force Protection for mine-resistant vehicles.</p> <p>The sense of strategy for both Iraq and Afghanistan is in danger of being lost in an ocean of tactical ideas and initiatives. To say we are going to stick it out, and hope to grind down the Taliban over the next 10 years is not a realistic strategic goal. After all, look at what has been achieved by the internationals in Afghanistan in the seven years since November 2001. (While there have been some gains socially, in health and education, security and the narco-economy must be put in the loss columns of the ledger).</p> <p>This week Henry Kissinger offered some pithy thoughts about the Vietnam saga, which should provide food for thought for the new US president. Critiquing the reflections of McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy's National Security Adviser, prepared by his researcher, and now critic, Gordon M Goldstein, Kissinger gave these thoughts: \"The purpose of war is victory. Stalemate is ... not a desirable strategic objective. Victory needs to be defined as an outcome achievable in a timeframe sustainable by American public opinion.\"</p> <p>All very well to have such 20-20 hindsight now, you may argue. However, Kissinger's warning about time in such conflicts is \u2013 pardon the pun \u2013 timely for what is now happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. Time is running out for the US and its allies in both countries \u2013 as the status of forces wrangle is proving in Iraq. You cannot talk about \"generational wars\" and \"open-ended commitments\" to seeing it through. You cannot say your forces can be squatters in these lands, when international law and diplomacy, and lore of the insurgents, does not recognise international squatters' rights.</p>",
  "<p><strong>JOKES AT EXPENSE OF OLD MAN = GUARANTEED POPULIST FUN</strong></p> <p>You absolutely cannot go wrong making cheap and tasteless jokes at the expense of pensioners - millions enjoy them, they're what makes Britain great - which probably explains why Madrid-based clown Ramon Calderon yesterday decided to curry favour by humourously accusing ageing football manager Sir Alex Ferguson of being \"senile\". A hilarious routine, and one that could only have been improved had he also given a run-out to that material he was working on about the nocturnal habits of Fergie's grandchildren.</p> <p>Not that poor old Alex appreciated the senility jibe. \"There is a lot of hot air comes out of that man,\" fumed the 193-year-old today, pointing at the roaring fire next to his comfy armchair, then trying to turn it off with the remote control. \"I am not getting involved but the nub of it is he is very disappointed he did not get Ronaldo. I am delighted to say he is still here and I will keep repeating that.\" At which point he got up and shuffled towards the kitchen, opened up the fridge, and placed his slippers inside. \"He is still here and I will keep repeating that,\" he added, taking his slippers out of the fridge then putting them in the fridge. \"He is still here and I will keep repeating tha... ooh look, cheese!

As a result, he's been demanding the Premier League takes a winter break. \"I've thought long and hard about this, and I have a plan,\" announced Ferguson. \"You could keep the Christmas fixtures as they are, but stagger one round of ten league matches throughout January,\" he told liverpoolfc.tv, who kindly sent the quotes on to the Old Trafford official magazine, Inside United. \"Three games could be played on the first weekend, another three on the next weekend and the final four on the third weekend.

  "<p>Over the past year, a select group of US and European diplomats has become much more familiar with the protagonists in the drama playing out in <a href=\"http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0107427.html\">North Kivu</a>. After long talks in January and a series of short visits since, they know the leading players in this drama: the Congolese government and army, the UN and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/congo1\">Laurent Nkunda</a>'s inner circle. They've heard the views of a smattering of North Kivu's humanitarians, politicians, businessmen, civil society types and militia leaders.</p> <p>They cooked up a peace plan that elevated the profile of some obscure armed groups (and even a couple of semi-fictitious ones for luck). They talked it up, then watched it fall apart as the signatories broke all the rules. The Congolese army and the UN thought they were containing the rebels, now the army has fled and the rebels are pinning down the UN. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/30/congo-eu-talks\">Now they're wondering how to get all these people talking and behaving again.</a></p> <p>In the diplomats' world, diplomats are centre stage. But diplomats are of marginal significance to the war-weary and increasingly frustrated local population, because they only seem concerned with the guys with the guns, and their schemes have yet to make a lasting difference.</p> <p>This is fair, but not completely true: if <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hoitt5BsM5OKJ2Mmc3g5q6iufXjwD944K2MG0\">Goma</a> is not in rebel hands today, and North Kivu not swarming with Rwandan soldiers, it is partially due to heavy US restraining pressure on Kigali. They are right not to give up, and further talks are inevitable, so what should they do to put things on an even keel?</p> <p>First, they should answer UN requests for more well-equipped troops (preferably special forces) capable of securing the territory surrounding Goma by force if necessary, and of helping to police the town itself. The EU may even mobilise a battle group to shore up the peacekeepers in the short-term (Britain's position on this could be decisive).</p> <p>Second, to bring a minimum of security, equal attention needs to be paid to the risks posed by the utterly demoralised Congolese troops. They're incapable of taking on the rebels, so they too need to be regrouped and brought under control under new leadership as an urgent damage limitation objective. If they are allowed to run amok or even switch sides, all bets are off.</p> <p>Third, maximum support and much greater prominence needs to be given to efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the huge numbers of displaced people. Contrary to rumours, agencies like the <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/congo_kinshasa?OpenDocument\">Red Cross</a> and MSF are still hard at work out there, and others are standing by.</p> <p>Fourth, they need to keep or increase the pressure on Rwanda, while reverting to a meaningful plan to deal with the problem of the Rwandan Hutu <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidaires\">genocidaires</a> still lingering in Congo, thus taking away their pretext for interference and Laurent Nkunda's raison d'etre. But they must be ready to face the real prospect of a new political grouping emerging from the rebellion that will have no democratic legitimacy in Congo, but may yet offer a viable alternative to war.</p> <p>These are merely crisis management measures that might stabilise the situation. Unless sufficient determination can be mustered to follow them up with more inclusive dialogue to address deeper problems including citizenship, management of natural resources, government legitimacy and return of refugees, violent instability will continue to plague eastern Congo and unsettle the entire region.</p>",
  "<p>Entertainment Rights, the media group that owns children's favourites such as Postman Pat and Rupert Bear, faces huge debts after wiping \u00a383m off the value of some of its characters, and has also admitted it may breach its banking covenants in the next few weeks.</p> <p>The company, which has seen its share price plummet after a series of profit warnings, has taken the red pen most savagely to Basil Brush. It has written down the vast majority of the value of the puppet fox, one of the company's first properties, as an admission that he is unlikely to ever make millions by breaking into new markets, such as the US, or become a major merchandising hit.</p> <p>Basil Brush's value has come down by \u00a315m, while Entertainment Rights has slashed a further \u00a342m off the value of business units that look after a raft of characters and brands including Transformers, He-Man, Roger Ramjet, Where's Wally and VeggieTales.</p> <p>The reduction in the value of these assets, many of which were acquired during the company's spending spree two years ago, is also an admission that the current dismal economic climate is likely to affect sales of merchandise, such as DVDs.</p> <p>Entertainment Rights added that it is locked in crucial negotiations with its main lender - Bank of Scotland - in an effort to renegotiate its overdraft. It was forced to ask the bank to temporarily waive the conditions attached to the loan and provide an emergency \u00a31m lifeline after breaching its banking covenants in August. </p> <p>It already owes \u00a3125m after a spate of acquisitions and its poor performance - that lead the firm to warn on profits for the second time in as many months on Friday - means the firm is likely to break its banking covenants again in November. </p> <p>To try and save Entertainment Rights' precious cash, chief executive Nick Phillips has already identified \u00a35m of cost savings and wants to save even more. He also plans to slash the company's spending budget from \u00a317m last year to just \u00a36m, and he focuses on some of the businesses' key brands.</p> <p>As a result of this new focus Phillips, the former UK boss of music group Warner who took over the reins in March after the firm's founder and chief executive Michael Heap was ousted, said the company may look to sell some of its characters.</p> <p>\"We are not planning to push any particular cat or fox out of the door,\" he said, alluding to the company's roster of furry characters. \"But we are selective acquirers and disposers of assets and certainly an announcement like this will generate interest.\"</p> <p>Entertainment Rights amassed much of its debts two years ago when it went on a spending spree that included buying America's Classic Media for \u00a3107m. That deal brought Lassie and The Lone Ranger into the company's portfolio and made it the world's biggest independent owner of children's brands. </p> <p>However, the company failed to fully integrate these businesses and costs ran out of control. It then suffered problems with a DVD distributor, which hit profits.</p> <p>The chairman, Rod Bransgrove, admitted that the board's detailed review of the business, which has been going on for almost a year, unearthed \"a number of issues\", which \"have conspired to present a worse picture than had previously been envisaged\".</p> <p>Bransgrove said the company should be back on a more stable footing by the end of its current financial year and \"I intend to stand down as chairman at that point to allow others to drive the future success of the business\".</p> <p>But shares in the company, which was involved in talks about a possible takeover in the Spring, lost more than a third of their value, dropping to just 1.25p. At that level the business is worth just \u00a39m. Two years ago Entertainment Rights was worth well over \u00a3250m. </p> <p>The company is currently changing its year-end and as a result its half-year figures cover the eight month period to the end of August. As a result of the writedown, the company made a loss for that period of \u00a3105m compared with a \u00a37.3m profit in the previous year. </p> <p>The company is still trying to finalise an American broadcast contract and license a number of non-core publishing rights but warned on Friday that these deals may not materialise this year. As a result the company warned its profits before financial charges could be \u00a310m lower than expected this year.</p> <p>One rare bright spot for the business, which also announced the appointment of a new finance director, Edward Knighton, on Friday, is the forthcoming film of The Lone Ranger. </p> <p>Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has lined up Johnny Depp to play the masked cowboy's sidekick Tonto and Entertainment Rights hopes that the film will boost sales of its Lone Ranger merchandise.</p> <p>The company is already marking this year's 75th anniversary of the character with the release of a collector's edition DVD and plans range of Lone Ranger merchandise later this year.</p>",

There were multiple screenings of the world premiere of a film made especially for and shown exclusively at the Viennale by one of the world's greatest directors. The fact that it ran for 63 seconds makes it no less of a coup for Hans Hurch, the festival's artistic director, whose radical taste is manifest in the varied selection of films.</p> <p>When Hurch suggested to friends that he was determined to get <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jeanlucgodard\">JLG</a> (most passionate cinephiles need only to see these initials to recognise whose they are) to make the publicity trailer for the festival \u2013 most of them scoffed. But Hurch, who had already got the likes of Stan Brakhage, Jonas Mekas, Leos Carax and Agn\u00e8s Varda to make these one-minute films, persevered undaunted. The reason for the scoffing was because Jean-Luc Godard was so notoriously reclusive and so often refused invitations to appear at festivals or retropectives of his films, that many suitors have given up asking him. He has also, on occasions, promised to appear at events and not turned up at the last minute. There was the celebrated affair when he abandoned contributing to what was to be an exhibition dedicated to his work at the Beaubourg museum in Paris, leaving a dreadful mess.</p> <p>So it was a real achievement when Hurch heard back from JLG by fax (he doesn't use emails) that he would be willing to make a trailer. Friends remained sceptical. Not Hurch. He knew that the 78-year-old Godard would deliver as promised because of Hurch's friendship with Jean-Marie Straub, whom Godard admires above all his contemporaries. And thus did Godard create the trailer in six days, and on the seventh day returned to his semi-retirement at his home on Lake Geneva in Switzerland.</p> <p>Godard brazenly opens his mini-miracle, entitled Une Catastrophe, his first work since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/103487/notre.musique\">Notre Musique</a> in 2004, with an extract from perhaps the most famous sequence in cinema history, the Odessa Steps section from Sergei Eisenstein's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36125/battleship.potemkin\">The Battleship Potemkin</a> (1925). We see the populace running down the steps, and the mother carrying her child in the opposite direction (a perfect demonstration of Eisenstein's formula of thesis and antithesis creating synthesis). But Godard, a keen sports fan, characteristically creates an incongruous stratum with an accompanying soundtrack of the grunts of tennis players delivering a first service, and the sound of balls upon rackets. Then a colourised stop-motion sequence of a dead man and the title: C'est La Premiere.</p> <p>A soldier stands with a machine gun at the ready before army tanks roll through a forest and planes start dropping red circular bombs. This is contrasted with a love scene, again in stop-motion, from the collective film People on Sunday (1930), the debut movie of three Austrian-born directors Edgar G. Ulmer, Fred Zinnemann and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/billywilder\">Billy Wilder</a>, with a sonorous reading of a Low German 18th-century poem on the soundtrack. The film ends with the title De L'Amour and the beginning of Robert Schumann's piano cycle Scenes from Childhood.</p> <p>Une Catastrophe is an autonomous piece, a cinematographic poem about violence and love, conceived in the style of Godard's Histoire(s) Du Cin\u00e9ma with a combination of images, sounds, language and music. All in 63 seconds!</p> <p>This was an apt prelude to the many films in the festival which do not conform to the tired narrative conventions of mainstream cinema. For example, Handl Klaus's intriguingly subtle <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1281962/\">March (M\u00e4rz)</a>, set in a small Tyrolean town, scrutinises the families of three young men who committed an apparently motiveless suicide, but explains nothing on the smooth surface, merely suggesting the turmoil beneath. These people, who lead empty, ordinary lives, could be the very ones who voted for the far right in the recent election.</p> <p>Three years ago, the young Catalonian Albert Serra's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799772/\">Honour of the Knights</a>, which followed a journey of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, was shown at the Viennale and won the International Critic's award. This year he returned with Birdsong (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1143891/\">El Cant Dels Ocells</a>), already shown at Cannes, another journey, this time of the three kings to pay homage to the baby Jesus.</p> <p>The film, constructed of extremely long takes, the visual equivalent of the adagios from an Anton Bruckner symphony (so singular is the film that it is easier to find comparisons outside cinema), follows the Magi as they trudge across the desert. The journey, which manages to be both absurdist and religious, takes place in the heat of summer, unlike <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tseliot\">TS Eliot</a>'s \"a cold coming we had of it\" but, like the poem, the trio is aware that \"this Birth was/ Hard and bitter agony for us, like Death, our death.\" There are some distant echoes of other films, the most direct homage being to Pasolini's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76223/gospel.according.to.st.matthew\">The Gospel According to St Matthew</a> (a reference for most auteurs tackling the subject) and the same director's The Canterbury Tales.</p> <p>Except for one brief, moving sequence \u2013 as the three kings prostrate themselves at the tiny feet of Jesus the Catalan melody of the title plays \u2013 all sound is diegetic. Birdsong was accompanied by a revealing documentary, called Waiting for Sancho, on aspects of the making of the film, by the critic Mark Peranson, who plays a mournful Joseph.</p> <p>These were among the highlights in a rich and off-the-beaten-track programme which included a homage to the tragic Austrian actress Nora Gregor, best known as the Marquise de la Chesnaye in Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game, who committed suicide in 1949; the extraordinary left-wing documentaries of John Gianvito; a concert given by Ingrid Caven, Rainer Fassbinder's wife from 1970 to 1972; and a tribute to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/bobdylan\">Bob Dylan</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/film+music/bobdylan\">in the movies</a>. One film, where he can be heard singing When He Returns, is the satiric Grandeur and Decadence d'un Petit Commerce de Cinema, made for French television in 1986 by none other than JLG.</p>",

Now it is in liquidation and 7,000 former employees are in shock. </p> <p>\"One day we went to work as usual, the next it was all closed,\" said Wei Sunying, gazing through the barred gate of the factory in Dongguan in southern <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/business+world/china\">China </a>where she spent eight years painting plastic components in a fume-filled room.</p> <p>\"Thousands of us are looking for jobs now. We walk around every day till our feet ache but we can't find anything.\"</p> <p>Few in the west have heard of Dongguan, but the chances are that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/manufacturing\">your shoes, your TV or your children's toys</a> originated here. Exports have built a city of up to 14 million inhabitants \u2014 twice the population of Greater London \u2014 almost all migrant workers from the countryside. Its economy has grown 15% annually in recent years. </p> <p>Now the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketturmoil\">global financial and economic crisis </a>is proving the final straw for exporters already punished by rising costs and a stronger currency. </p> <p>In the last year, chill winds have blown through the baking Pearl River Delta. Sixty-seven thousand small and medium-sized businesses in China collapsed in the first half of 2008, many in these manufacturing heartlands, says the national economic planning body. Toy firms have been particularly badly hit, thanks to safety scares and product recalls. Textile firms, with wafer-thin margins, are also reeling. </p> <p>Next came tighter credit for many foreign-owned firms, such as Hong Kong's Smart Union. And then, in the last two months, a sharp drop in US and European demand as consumers reined in spending. </p> <p>A local trade association predicts that by the end of January, Dongguan and its neighbours Shenzhen and Guangzhou will lose 9,000 of their 45,000 factories. </p> <p>\"Many factories are looking at completely empty order books,\" warned Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered, who believes the export sector will be stagnant and could even shrink next year.</p> <p>Green predicts that China will grow 7.9% next year \u2014 well below the double-digit figures enjoyed over the last half decade \u2014 while others suggest it could fall closer to 7%.</p> <p>That sounds enviable to western countries facing recession. But with the working age population still growing, China needs at least 8% growth to maintain the current employment rate. And the fall-out will be highly concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong.</p> <p>\"The social impact of this is going to be huge. The problems are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Wooyeal Paik, who is researching Dongguan's industry and migrant workforce at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"Impromptu protests by disgruntled workers left jobless and without pay are becoming more common; they have resorted to petitioning local officials for backpay because they have few other ways to remonstrate and be compensated.</p> <p>\"They will complain more and they will go to local government offices more... You will see demonstrations and picketing. And probably there's a risk of violence against bosses \u2014 especially foreigners.\"</p> <p>Dongguan's government stepped in to reimburse the Smart Union workers to the tune of 24,000 yuan (\u00a32.2m) after thousands gathered at the factory gates and outside local authority offices.</p> <p>But two months' back pay \u2014 1200 yuan for most \u2014 will not last long. There is no redundancy package and a lawsuit by workers appears to have limited prospects of success.</p> <p>Wei, from Guizhou, is one of many struggling to find new work. Even if she could read the job adverts, most ask for recruits under 35; she is just over 40. </p> <p>\"I came here as a migrant worker because my children need money for schooling,\" she said. </p> <p>\"Now I can't support my children. I don't even have enough money to get back home and it's expensive to stay here.\"</p> <p>Even job offers aren't always what they seem, said 26-year-old Fang Jianlin, whose friends were recently conned. </p> <p>\"Recruiters told them the conditions and the salaries were very good, but on the way to the place they were asked for money. They got robbed; some were even beaten,\" he said.</p> <p>Smart Union was such a popular employer that Fang paid a hefty \"introduction fee\" to win his job there. At worst, he and his wife would earn around 600 yuan a month; at the busiest times, when production ran until 2am, they could take home 2,100 yuan each. </p> <p>But he and his wife will return to his village in Sichuan in a few days, where his parents are rearing their children, unless new work turns up. They are not sure how they will support the family, but cannot afford the 50 yuan a day in rent, food and transport to stay here.</p> <p>It's a sobering end to the dream which lures millions of workers to Dongguan each year, where they struggle and study their way towards the promise of a regular income; perhaps even a place in the burgeoning middle classes. At the city's night schools, thousands of workers end their long days with classes on everything from car maintenance to law.</p> <p>Bob Li is one of the area's success stories. He arrived in 1995 as a casual labourer. \"Everyone in my hometown had heard Guangdong was covered in gold,\" he said.</p> <p>Now he manages a factory for Richall, which supplies durable bags to companies such as Walmart, Carlsberg and Disney. Twenty-five thousand totes for Tesco are stacked up awaiting delivery.</p> <p>But he is unnerved by the economic downturn.</p> <p>\"These days it is getting more and more difficult for factories like us,\" he said, citing the cost of wages and materials. </p> <p>\"The exchange rate is already a huge issue here; people are losing interest. The price of our materials has risen because they're made from oil... Taken together, costs have risen by 30%-40%.\"</p> <p>To some extent, Dongguan has become a victim of its own success. The rising prosperity of the region has created inflationary pressures. Workers want higher wages; new labour laws are designed to wipe out sweatshops but bring higher costs, which squeeze many companies. </p> <p>Manufacturers have already fled inland to cheaper provinces, in many cases encouraged by Guangdong authorities, who hoped to move the province up the value chain \u2014 condensing 200 years of western industrial history into fewer than 15. </p> <p>\"We have a policy to empty the cage for the new birds,\" Guangdong's vice-governor, Wan Qingliang, told reporters this month. </p> <p>\"The ultimate target is to build the Pearl River Delta into the core region of modern manufacturing.\"</p> <p>Others are unsure of the wisdom of the policy in the face of a worldwide downturn.</p> <p>\"Places like Guangdong miscalculated the development of the economy. They actually tried to push those labour intensive and small and medium sized enterprises out of the [established industrial] area because they wanted hi-tech industries there. But when something bad happens, like the economic downturn, what are they going to do?\" said Paik. </p> <p>He acknowledges that numerous East Asian economies, such as Japan, have moved up the value chain in just the same way; and that the Chinese government deserves to be confident, given its economic record.</p> <p>\"But they haven't experienced a serious economic downturn except right after 1989 and have been overconfident in their policy of the quick transformation of industrial structure toward hi-tech in Guangdong,\" he cautioned.</p> <p>The risk is that officials push the city off the economic ladder rather than up it. Whether new subsidies, export tax rebates and other support for small businesses can save them remains to be seen.</p> <p>Yet China's rising living standards in the 30 years since economic reforms were launched has left most people optimistic about its long-term prospects.

  "<p>Today is the anniversary of a United Nations security council resolution that, if fully implemented, could change the dynamics of war and peace. Eight years ago, the UN security council voted unanimously to pass <a href=\"http://www.iwtc.org/333.html\">resolution 1325</a>, their first ever resolution to address the impact of war on women, and women's contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable peace. It calls for equal participation of women in all aspects of conflict prevention, peace building and reconstruction; prevention of violence against women and protection of the human rights of women and girls during times of conflict. A similar resolution was passed by the European parliament in November 2000, with an accompanying recommendation calling for at least 40% women's representation in all levels of decision-making in peace building and post-conflict recovery.</p> <p>Both resolutions tackle full on the glaring fact that peacemaking is mostly in the hands of the world's men. Peacemaking and peace-building ought not to be left so overwhelmingly to men, for one practical reason: men on their own are no good at it. The record proves it. Arnold Whittick, who served in the infantry in France in the first world war, was lecturer to HM forces on reconstruction in the second world war. Writing about the Versailles treaty peace talks he said, \"Some might reflect sadly that if women's influence had been stronger there might have been no second world war, but one does not write history with ifs.\"</p> <p>In today's troubled world more than 50% of all conflicts break out all over again within 10 years. The problem derives in part from deeply flawed peacemaking attempts, in which women are under-represented in ongoing top-level decision-making on peace- and state-building processes, while men, who are more likely to be the wagers of war, are over-represented. </p> <p>The other reason women should be equal partners in peace-building is to ensure issues of importance to women's lives, as well as men's, are high on the agenda such as: personal security and safety; infrastructure and services; livelihood and employment; property rights; food security; needs of widows and female former combatants; political representation and decision making; and preventing impunity for rape. There have been pockets of progress on making 1325 work at grassroots and middle levels. <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org/\">UNFPA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unifem.org/\">UNIFEM</a> and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights have been working with women's NGOs and national governments to implement UNSCR 1325. The UK and other UN member states have drawn up national action plans for 1325.</p> <p>The extreme disappointment is at the top levels, where it counts. Government ministers, politicians and diplomats have consistently failed to insist women be included as equal partners at the top table in peace talks. They have also failed to appoint women heads of UN missions. Out of 30 current peace operations (peacekeeping, political, and peacebuilding missions), there is only one female chief of mission, the UN secretary general's special representative to Liberia, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Margrethe_L%C3%B8j\">Ellen Margrethe L\u00f8j</a> from Denmark. </p> <p>Women also continue to be frozen out from top-table peace talks despite energetic, courageous lobbying by female NGO leaders in war-torn countries demanding to be included. Exasperated at women on both sides not being treated as equal partners with men at the top table of the Middle East peace talks, Israeli women have told me they are on the verge of challenging their own government in the law courts. This step is unprecedented.</p> <p>In Sri Lanka, women's groups <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/blog/web_opendemocracy_net/our_1325_rural_workshops_in_sri_lanka\">lobbied</a> both domestic political leaders and the Norwegians who were acting as peace-brokers to bring the country's interminable civil war to an end \u2013 but these women weren't included at the top table and the killing goes on. In the Balkans, the international contact group brokering talks on the status of Kosovo included four permanent members of the UN security council \u2013 the United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia. Yet they ignored their own resolution 1325. The NGO Women in Black in Belgrade and, on the other side, the Kosovo NGO Network comprising 80 women's NGOs, including the <a href=\"http://www.womensnetwork.org/\">Kosovo Women's Network</a>, demonstrated and lobbied their own politicians, Members of the European parliament and the international contact group for the right to be included as equal partners in negotiations. Result? The contact group, led by special envoy and now Noble peace prize Laureate Marti Ahtisaari ignored the Balkan women's peaceful requests. </p> <p>Equal participation of women and men in conflict prevention and peace talks would be a natural next step to a precedent that has already emerged in post-conflict parliamentary elections, in which women's NGOs have lobbied hard for a gender balance quota with the result that one third of countries with more than 30% women in parliament are countries recovering from conflict, including Rwanda (56.3%); Mozambique (34.8%); Nepal (33.2%); Burundi (30.5%); Uganda (30.7%); Angola (37.3%); South Africa (32.8%). Even Afghanistan (27.7%) and Iraq (25.5%) have a higher percentage of women in parliament than in the United Kingdom's House of Commons. </p> <p>The old view that women in conflict zones are victims rather than an immense prospective resource for bringing conflict to an end must be overcome.</p> <p>Readers can help to \"give peace a chance\". Every time there are peace talks anywhere, from the Congo to the Caucasus, ask your government ministers. diplomats and UN officials: \"Where are the women?\" Support and encourage NGOs lobbying for women to be equal partners in setting the peace agenda.</p>",
  "<p>Rima and Tareef Nashashibi must be the most intriguing siblings in politics. Migrants to the United States from Palestine, they both love America, civil liberties and apple pie. They are both highly significant political figures in their home state of California, and devote all of their free time to campaigning. The difference however, is that whilst Rima is a Democrat, her brother is a staunch Republican.</p> <p>\"It's just our make-up and the paths we've taken,\" said Tareef. \"I started out a small businessman, she was always an activist with causes, so the Democrats were the best fit for her. The older I got, the more conservative I became. I think having children changes you.\"</p> <p>When you ask Rima why her views are so different to her brother's she takes a deep breath. \"Seriously\", she says in a sombre tone, \"He was dropped on his head as a baby.\"</p> <p>In next month's presidential election, the majority of America's 2.4 million Muslims are likely to vote with Rima rather than Tareef. </p> <p>A survey carried out by the Pew Research Centre last year found that 63% of American Muslims identify with the Democrats as compared with 11% for Republicans.</p> <p>The votes of Arab Muslims however, are less difficult to predict. </p> <p>This group, which makes up one quarter of America's total Muslim population, tends to be more conservative than their black and Asian counterparts. In Rima and Tareef's home of Orange county, the Arab Muslim population has helped sustain Republican rule. </p> <p>\"Arabs are often socially conservative and successful in business, so they tend to assume they are Republican,\" said Rima. \"But they never look up the fine print of what that means.\" </p> <p>Tareef might not look like a traditional Republican, but his values are totally in tune with the party. As a highly paid manager in a construction firm, Tareef says he finds the small government, low tax and anti-union policies of the right attractive because they suit his business. He also says he is \"automatically drawn in\" by the social values of the party - family, order, patriotism - on account of his ethnicity. </p> <p>Rima also has a high-flying career. In between her duties as the vice chair of the Democratic Party for Orange County, she holds down a day job at American International Group (AIG). </p> <p>So why is Rima - given that she is an Arab-Muslim property owner who helps manage an investment bank - not also voting for the right? \"If I were to follow the herd I'd be a Republican, but you have to be socially responsible,\" she said. \"In truth it's got nothing to do with my background - the Democrats are simply a party for people who believe in good jobs, good education and a balanced budget.\"</p> <p>Although both Rima and Tareef admit that their political beliefs are often a source of conflict, they insist that politics has never got in the way of their close personal relationship. Rima \u2013 who doesn't have children of her own - moved from Seal Beach to Laguna Hills to be closer to her brother and his family. </p> <p>She can regularly be found at Tareef's house indulging in some of his Arabic cooking, \"I know where my bread is buttered, know what I'm saying?\" she says with a chuckle, \"Of course we have heated arguments over dinner - I rub his nose in the last hardcore Republican that's converted to the Democrats - but it's friendly competition and sibling rivalry at its best. We never let politics get in the way. Family comes first.\"</p> <p>In fact at times, the ideological split between Rima and Tareef doesn't so much feel like a hostile dividing line, but an affectionate bond that brings them closer together \u2013 they are like two peas in a politically confused pod.</p> <p>Perhaps their most amusing collaborative endeavour is their joint stand-up comedy routine You the Republican, Me the Democrat, which raised $120,000 for the Middle East Student Initiative earlier this year. In these entirely improvised shows, Tareef stands at the podium whilst Rima wonders about the audience heckling him from a cordless mike. </p> <p>\"It just comes out spontaneously,\" said Rima. \"He'll say something like 'You might be a Democrat Sis but we're still in Orange county!' and I'll say 'Yeah right \u2013 but have you looked at the electoral register recently?'\"</p> <p>Rima's jibe hits home. In Orange county and elsewhere, the Republican's traditional base of Arab-Muslim support has been slowly slipping away under the policies pursued by President Bush since 9/11. </p> <p>According to Pew's research, 71% of Muslims who describe themselves as conservative say they now disapprove of Bush's performance. The terrorism-driven clamp down on civil liberties at home and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan abroad have tested the loyalty of some of the party's most devout Arab supporters. </p> <p>\"The fine print of what it means to be a Republican is coming to the surface and the community is starting to change,\" said Rima. \"Obama's victory shows that people are sick of the status quo \u2013 we can win this election.\" </p> <p>For once Tareef agrees with his sister, admitting that it has become harder to hold his head up as a Republican in the Muslim community. \"People ask me how I can still be a member and I say I chose the party because of its ideals, not because of its presidency,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In the past the Republican party was the leader of ethnic outreach. But then the neo-cons came and the Republicans have fallen behind. Of course it can be changed if the right people come along, but I don't think McCain will make any difference. He has deep-seated issues with the Arab world.\"</p> <p>Rima notes with a smile, \"My brother is more of a Democrat than he thinks.\"</p> <p>Since 9/11 Rima and Tareef have found their political beliefs steadily moving closer together. It started in 2002 when the Bush administration brought in \"special registration\". Introduced in reaction to the terrorist attacks, this legislation required every Arab male over 16 to register with the government. Failing to register or produce legal documentation was grounds for deportation. No other migrant communities were subject to these procedures. </p> <p>\"It was a flashback to the regressive regimes many people left to pursue the American dream,\" said Rima. \"Stereotyping, discrimination \u2013 it was the worst kind of racial profiling.\" </p> <p>Both siblings opposed the proposals, \"Rima would lobby the Democrats and I would lobby the Republicans,\" said Tareef. \"When we speak on record together, people know we are speaking on behalf of the whole community because both parties are represented.\" </p> <p>The siblings continued to work in coalition when the Iraq war started in 2003, sharing political contacts and organising joint community meetings. </p> <p>\"Most Republicans were so gung-ho about supporting the war I felt like a traitor for opposing it,\" said Tareef, \"but the whole public basis for the war was lies and misconceptions.\"</p> <p>\"I've lived in the Middle East so I saw things through a different filter. I knew that Iraq and Afghanistan would never let a foreign power control them, and everything we warned about came true.\"</p> <p>It was shortly after the Iraq war started that Tareef significantly scaled down his role in the Republican party, ending his presidency of the Arab American Club for Orange County in 2004 and stepping down from the state's central committee in 2006. </p> <p>Although he cites health reasons and other priorities, he admits that Iraq, \"along with the whole neo-con agenda\" played some part in his decision to reduce his Republican commitments. Yet he refuses to hand in his membership. \"If I leave then no one will listen to me,\" he said, \"If you join a party and you disagree with a particular policy you have a democratic way of changing that. You have to be part of the system if you want it to change.\"</p> <p>Children of a Palestinian family, Rima and Tareef were born and raised in Jerusalem. The Nashashibis have always been a political clan; their father was a co-founder of the Palestinian National Liberation League, and met the brother of his future wife whilst defending the city of Jerusalem in 1948. </p> <p>\"My father always encouraged my political activism as much as he did my brothers,\" said Rima, \"Politics is in our blood as Palestinians and as Nashashibis.\" </p> <p>The family moved to Orange county in 1980, but Rima regularly returns to her homeland, and in 2005 was sent by the state department to help run campaigning workshops for Palestinian women in the run up to the national elections. \"I felt kinship with the people I was working with\" she said, \"We are one people, whether we are in the diaspora or the occupied territories. A lot of them want me to move back, but I know that staying in the States is the best way to help them. The real decisions are made here.\"</p> <p>Although Rima is convinced that Obama would offer more hope for Palestinians than McCain, she is not unrealistic about the Democrats' potential for achieving peace in the Middle East, \"If we're working on the same principles of Oslo and Madrid then anything we produce is going to be a band aid and not address the real cause of the problem,\" she said. </p> <p>\"I love the party but I don't love it blindly. The obligation is on us to educate party decisions.\"</p> <p>Tareef, who also remains highly conscious of his roots, is equally sceptical of both parties' commitments to help his homeland. </p> <p>\"Foreign policy on this issue doesn't really change regardless of whether the government is Republican or Democrat. It depends who you are talking to \u2013 there are different personal, not party, platforms.\"</p> <p>Irrespective of their political differences, Rima and Tareef both want change. At the moment, only Obama seems to be offering it. </p> <p>The country will have to wait and see whether the Democrats' platform is enough to attract the disaffected Arab vote from its traditional Republican base. </p> <p>Tareef's two children, Mufeed and Rasha, diplomatically keep their emerging political opinions to themselves. Whether they'll grow up to support Daddy's Republicans or Aunty's Democrats is not yet known.</p>",

  "<p>How many of us take notice of Girls Aloud's albums? Surely they should be excused from having to make them - their singles are of such unwavering brilliance there is no need to supplement them with 11 additional tracks that aren't quite up to standard.

But despite ear-catching touches such as the deadpan voiceover on Love Is the Key, nothing hits the spot like the Phil Spector-like single The Promise, one of this year's better chart-toppers.

  "<p>A Colombian man, believed to be a major narcotics trafficker who threatened the lives of federal law enforcement officials, was secretly flown into the United States on a Customs Service plane and whisked yesterday morning to the federal court in Central Islip, New York, for arraignment.</p> <p>Carlos Patino Restrepo, 44, was brought to the courthouse in an armored car that was part of a 10-vehicle convoy of federal agents and State Police cars. Patino Restrepo is charged with having brought tonnes of cocaine into the United States beginning in the 1990s, according to court documents.</p> <p>The convoy with Patino Restrepo drove rapidly up to the courthouse yesterday morning. Some of the cars blocked off both ends of the roadway while the armored car carrying him went down a guarded ramp to the prisoner's entrance, according to one person who witnessed the scene.</p> <p>Patino Restrepo was under arrest in Colombia by authorities there on suspicion of acting as a desaparecido - a presumed murderer who makes his rivals and possible informants disappear, according to newspaper accounts in Colombia.</p> <p>In the United States, Patino Restrepo is being handled with unusually tight security because he has threatened to murder the federal prosecutor and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who had been investigating his case for over a year, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p> <p>The threats included detailed information on where they lived and their children, according to the sources. As a result, the prosecutor and the agent have been replaced and placed under guard by the US Marshals Service, and new prosecutors and agents have been assigned to the case, according to the sources.</p> <p>Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the US attorney's office, declined to comment on whether any threats against prosecutors or agents in the case were under investigation.</p> <p>Patino Restrepo pleaded not guilty before a US district court judge, Joanna Seybert, who held him without bail as both a flight risk and a danger to the community.</p> <p>Patino Restrepo's attorney, Todd Merer, of Manhattan, said the claims that his client wanted to kill the previous prosecutor and agent on the case were false, and based on the fraudulent testimony of two or three people in Colombia.</p> <p>Merer said he could prove that the people who supposedly heard Restrepo make the threats were not even with him at the time.</p> <p>Merer said he was unaware of the charges against his client in Colombia.</p>",
  "<p>Few things have illustrated the disdain which George Bush feels towards foreign countries more clearly than his appointments to top international posts.

It was considered a test case of the principle that human rights abusers are accountable for crimes regardless of where they are brought to book.</p> <p>Emmanuel, a US citizen, was born in Boston and spent his teenage years with his mother and stepfather in Orlando. He later joined his father, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/04/westafrica.qanda\">Charles Taylor</a> in Liberia and became head of the country's elite security force, the Anti-Terrorism Unit - nicknamed the Demon Forces.</p> <p>Charles Taylor is on trial before a UN-backed tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, for alleged human rights violations during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sierraleone\">Sierra Leone's civil war</a>. </p> <p>Federal agents arrested Emmanuel as he tried to enter the US at Miami international airport in March 2006. </p> <p>According to a federal indictment, Emmanuel's job from 1999 to 2002 was to intimidate, weaken and eliminate his father's political opponents.</p> <p>During the trial, witnesses said Emmanuel, known as Chuckie in Liberia, stood by and laughed as soldiers forced prisoners to play \"stone football\", kicking large stones until their bare feet were bruised and bleeding.

He would sleep beside one of his replica guns and would sometimes race off from home without warning.</p> <p>Newitt, the subject of an earlier bankruptcy order, was prosecuted in 2005 for failing to keep proper accounts.</p> <p>His latest business, Micina Technologies, based near Hinckley, was on the brink of collapse, the court heard, and he was struggling to pay for his car, business premises and the mooring fees for his \u00a3200,000 motor cruiser.</p> <p>Newitt began offending after falling out with the manager of a marina who removed his boat from its mooring in December 2006.</p> <p>He demanded it be put back, claiming he was an undercover intelligence officer \u2013 and served the manager with a copy of the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>The court was told that Newitt's story began to unravel after he called Hinckley police station in April claiming to have information about drugs.</p> <p>PC Lee Smith, who had a military background, was suspicious of Newitt's \"Commander\" title, checked him out and arrested him.</p> <p>Officers seized from him a pair of handcuffs, a friction-lock baton, three air weapons and ammunition, seven flash grenades, shredded identity documents, four non-functioning police radio handsets and earpieces.</p> <p>Newitt admitted five fake ID card offences, fraudulently claiming to be a police officer and carrying two imitation firearms: a replica Glock 9mm pistol and a commando rifle.</p> <p>Gary Short, defending, said Newitt was a man of low self-esteem who, having set up the fantasy lifestyle, started acquiring articles to impress. \"In his eyes, Commander Newitt was a real person,\" he said. \"The persona was created to give himself a feeling of worth and to generate respect from others, and not to commit criminal offences.\"</p>",
  "<p>It comes as no surprise that the European Commission is relaxed about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2008/oct/28/mandelson-georgeosborne\">Peter Mandelson's meetings</a> with the aluminium magnate, Oleg Deripaska, at a time when the trade commissioner was party to discussions that would affect the business of the Russian.</p> <p>Brussels has long had a reputation as being unaccountable to public opinion. Despite the commission's attempts to open up EU decision-making to greater public scrutiny \u2013 through its <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/eti/index_en.htm\">European Transparency Initiative</a> \u2013 secrecy remains the modus operandi. The system governing the behaviour of officials allows for widespread conflicts of interest. Parliamentary rules for MEPs have been described by one British MEP as a \"scandal waiting to happen\".</p> <p>Numerous cases have been documented of apparent conflicts of interests involving MEPs. Giles Chichester <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/05/conservatives.eu\">hit the headlines</a> this summer after breaking the rules on MEP's expenses and was forced to resign as chairman of the Conservative party in Brussels. However, little has been made of his problematic ties to the nuclear industry. He is president of a pro-nuclear industry lobby group known in Brussels as \"The submarine of the energy industry\". Until recently, he also held the key position of chair of the EU parliamentary committee with responsibility for nuclear issues, including nuclear safety, decommissioning and nuclear waste disposal.</p> <p>Another example is Scottish Conservative MEP, John Purvis, who has a financial stake in a firm that invests in the biotechnology sector. At the same time he has been seen as a leading advocate for biotech in the European parliament. Another Brit, Caroline Jackson MEP, sits on the parliament's environment committee and drafted a report on the EU's waste framework directive while at the same time being a paid advisor to private waste company, <a href=\"http://www.shanks.co.uk/shanks/\">Shanks</a>.</p> <p>Jackson is one of five EU officials nominated for a <a href=\"http://www.worstlobby.eu/2008/\">\"Worst Lobby Award\"</a>, an initiative organised by a coalition of civil society groups pushing for greater transparency in Brussels. Among the corporate interests up for an award is the <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/index.htm\">International Air Transport Association</a> for its deceptive lobbying campaign to avoid CO2 reduction obligations in the aviation sector. Also nominated is <a href=\"http://www.eaasm.eu/\">The European Alliance for Access to Safe Medicines</a> for hiding the involvement of the big pharmaceutical companies in their campaigns.</p> <p>The awards spotlight just a few of the thousands of mainly commercial organisations that seek to influence EU policy. In Brussels, as in Britain, lobbyists operate in an almost entirely unregulated environment. In June the European Commission attempted to increase transparency in the industry by introducing a register of lobbyists. Registration, however, is voluntary and as few as 10% of the thousands of commercial lobbying firms that peddle influence and access in Brussels have so far chosen to sign on to it.</p> <p>Thanks to the recent insight into the affairs of the rich and powerful, we should be under no illusion in Britain that undue influence is also being exerted on our policy-makers. Our lobbying industry, which today includes law and accountancy firms, management consultancies, think tanks, charities and others, has grown to be worth an estimated \u00a31.9bn. It is embedded in our political system, and, as in Brussels, it operates away from the public gaze.</p> <p>Under the radar of most journalists, a parliamentary inquiry has been taking place into the normally opaque world of lobbying. Throughout the last 12 months, the influential <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/public_administration_select_committee.cfm\">public administration select committee</a>, chaired by Tony Wright MP, has taken evidence on whether certain interests are being afforded privileged access to, and undue influence over, our decision makers. It has also sought to find out what effect this is having on public trust in politics.</p> <p>The recommendations the select committee will make in the next few weeks are key. If it finds, much as the British public suspects, that there is an enormous disparity in access and influence in our political system, it should recommend action: that the government introduce a mandatory register of lobbyists. This is the first step in opening up the opaque world of lobbying to public scrutiny. The effect will be to increase the accountability of government to the people they serve. Something that the majority of the British public has long ceased to expect but should now demand.</p> <p>The Mandelson-Deripaska affair gives us a rare insight into the relationship between politics and the wealthy elite. A register of lobbyists would guarantee that information on those who seek to influence our politicians is systematically put into the public domain.</p>",
  "<p>He may have called it Home, but 21-year-old Peter Broderick spends most of his debut album gazing at the heavens. The opening song, Games, layers vocal harmonies, the sound of angels chanting and melodies from an acoustic guitar, plucked with such gentleness that he might almost be playing a harp. His first words come in the second song, And It's Alright, which opens with the line: \"Seven shooting stars in one night\". The rest of the album maintains this celestial mood, and by the time Broderick has repeated the harp-and-angels effect four or five times, the burnished loveliness starts to dull. Before he moved from Oregon to Copenhagen, Broderick worked with Portland singer M Ward, whose influence is felt in the varied atmosphere of Maps, and background of laughter and radio static in Games. To really shine, Broderick needs more of that experimentalism, less awe at his ability to create beauty.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft has made its <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx\">Azure</a> cloud computing announcements at PDC, so now we know what it's doing: it is extending Windows 2008 Server into the online market so that programmers who develop applications in Visual Studio (and other things, see below) can <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/archives/emailPrint.jsp?R=printThis&amp;A=/article/08/10/31/microsoft-azure-cloud-qa_1.html\">test them locally and deploy them globally</a>. Azure runs the same code but uses a hypervisor to distribute it across multiple machines and, next year, multiple data centres on different continents. Application management is automatic. It's not clear how you'll pay for it, but there will be some form of pay-by-use based on processor time, disk storage and bandwidth.</p> <p>One of the questions that inevitably came up was whether Azure was just <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2001/Mar01/03-19HailstormPR.mspx\">Hailstorm</a> revisited. See, for example, Ina Fried's <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10078496-56.html\">Azure manages to avoid a Hailstorm of criticism</a>, and Mary-Jo Foley's <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1681\">Ozzie responds: Is Microsoft Azure just 'Hailstorm' revisited?</a><br><br>Hailstorm was the codename of Microsoft's last attempt at cloud computing, which was based on its .Net programming platform, but it was based on using Microsoft services (such as Passport for identity management) rather than Microsoft servers.</p> <p>The .net framework has been a success, but in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/may/24/microsoft.internet\">2001</a>, world+dog threw a wobbly at the whole idea of relying on Microsoft services. Also, hosted applications such as Microsoft Office -- which was available over the net -- didn't get any traction. But Azure is a different proposition. As Ray Ozzie tells Mary-Jo:</p> <blockquote> <p> \"In that era (Microsoft) believed in pure centralization in 'true integrated storage,' the middle. My DNA tells me \u2014 and you can see this in my past and what I've done before \u2014 that it's a world of decentralization and that you synchronize the truth amongst many things, both in the center and at the edge on the devices where you need them. So, that's very architectural different.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Whether Azure is actually any good is another matter, but it does take the cloud computing idea into distributed and multitenant applications. As Microsoft says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The fundamental assumption in Windows Azure is that there is no single point of failure. No computer by going down will take down your application. If your app is not written in that way ... then fundamentally the application pattern does have to change. </p> </blockquote> <p>Dion Almaer, one of the Google Gears developers who went to the show (but who is <em>not speaking for Google</em>, of course), <a href=\"http://almaer.com/blog/microsoft-say-game-on-thoughts-on-pdc\">blogged</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Everything that was announced we pretty much knew was happening. From the cloud, to the Web (Silverlight 2 / IE 8), and beyond. But, even though we knew about this, I don't know if we thought they were this far along. <em>Microsoft is executing</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you are a Microsoft developer you are probably very happy at Ray Ozzie's coming out party. Others on the fence may be interested. For those of us who worry about handing Microsoft control of the browser, plugins to other browsers, the cloud, the server model, and more\u2026. I won't lie to you. I am cautiously observing. Silverlight adoption worries me.<br>We can't fight Microsoft with \"don't choose them, remember what they did to you before?\" Fear is lame. Instead, this is a wake up call to Adobe, Google, Yahoo!, Amazon, IBM, Sun, [insert other developer / platform players] to get kicking. <br><em>We can't just be Open, we have to be better!</em> </p> </blockquote> <p>When it comes to being open, Microsoft will argue that Azure is open. Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio aren't open, of course, though having them in the cloud is a major attraction for companies that already use them. However, as <a href=\"http://port25.technet.com/archive/2008/10/27/the-azure-platform-debuts.aspx\">Sam Ramji</a>, the director of Microsoft's Open Source Software Lab, points out, developers \"will also be able to choose from a range of open source development tools and technologies, and be able to access Azure services using a variety of common internet standards, including HTTP, REST, WS* and Atom.\"</p> <blockquote> <p>The Azure platform's goal is to support all developers and their choice of IDE, language and technology. We are also providing programmable components that can be consumed by other applications, and Microsoft is funding and sponsoring open source software development kits to enable Java and Ruby developers to take advantage of Azure.<br>This is significant as this is the first time we are delivering cross-platform software development kits at the same time as Microsoft Developer Network software development kits. </p> </blockquote> <p>One key thing for Microsoft is that it already hosts a vast amount of \"cloud computing\" through services such as Hotmail, Live Search, Live ID (formerly Passport), MSN, Spaces, SkyDrive, BizTalk, Windows Live, Office Live, CRM and so on -- probably including Windows Update. Like Google, it is already big on the web. Microsoft has a huge incentive to make Azure work well in order to support its own 160 or so services. And if it can do that, it could offer Azure services to the rest of the world at marginal prices, which is essentially what Amazon does now.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 30 session</strong></p> <p><strong>European Investment Bank</strong></p> <p>Alistair Darling urged banks to use a \u00a34bn package of support from the European Investment Bank to help small and medium-sized businesses through the credit crunch. </p> <p>\"It doesn't mean that everyone who comes through the front door of a bank gets what they want on the terms they want. But I really do think it is important that British banks play their part,\" said the chancellor.</p> <p>George Osborne said that a sustained cut in interest rates would be the thing that would most help business. And the shadow chancellor warned ministers against \"irresponsible spinning about Keynesian spending splurges\", which had \"spooked the money markets\". </p> <p>But Darling said the Tories \"haven't a clue\" how to deal with the financial crisis and insisted it was the government that was taking decisive action. </p> <p><strong>Small businesses</strong></p> <p>Mark Prisk, for the Tories, accused the government of not moving quickly enough to ensure fresh funds from the EIB reached hard-pressed British businesses. </p> <p>He welcomed the \u00a34bn package but challenged ministers to explain why France had already issued the \"first tranche\" of its share of the money to small firms. </p> <p>The business minister, Pat McFadden, said that Darling and the business secretary, Lord Mandelson, were \"pressing ahead with this as quickly as possible\" in discussions with the banks.</p> <p><strong>Taliban </strong></p> <p>Allowing the Taliban to win the war in Afghanistan would present \"a clear and present danger to the security of the UK\", the defence secretary, John Hutton, said. </p> <p>He acknowledged that there were those asking why British soldiers were dying in the country, but he said success was vital to the UK's national security. </p> <p>Hutton urged \"patience\", arguing that there was \"real and tangible evidence of progress\". </p> <p><strong>Repossessions</strong></p> <p>The government came under pressure from Mark Hoban, for the Tories, to stop nationalised banks being so quick to repossess homes. </p> <p>Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said every lender had the responsibility to \"do the right thing\" by their borrowers to help avoid taking their house. </p> <p><strong>Big firms</strong></p> <p>Darling said that the concentration of auditing in a handful of big firms \"can be a problem\". </p> <p>He told David Heath (Lib Dem, Somerton and Frome): \"I agree that the fact there are comparatively few large accountancy firms who can carry out audits can be a problem. I'm not sure we can produce more auditors just like that.\" </p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong></p> <p>Using anti-terrorism legislation to freeze the assets of a stricken Icelandic bank was \"utterly inappropriate\" and harmed Britain's international reputation, Richard Ottaway (Con, Croydon South) said. </p> <p>Darling replied: \"It was necessary for us to take action to safeguard the position of creditors in the UK.\" </p> <p><strong>Social housing</strong></p> <p>Frank Dobson, the Labour former health secretary, said: \"Most people will hope that the government will continue to step up investment in social housing and ignore the views of the stupid, comfortably-off collection of professors and ne'er-do-wells who wrote in the Times that Keynesian overspending wouldn't rescue the economy and claimed that if the government invested as it proposes it would lead to the serious misallocation of resources.\" </p> <p>Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said that Dobson was \"absolutely right about our need to maintain commitment to investment\". </p> <p><strong>BBC</strong></p> <p>The prime minister's \"blatant attack\" on the BBC in the wake of the Russell Brand-Jonathan Ross lewd calls scandal was evidence that the licence fee ought to be scrapped, Christopher Chope, the Tory former minister, claimed. </p> <p>He said the government had recently opposed his bill to abolish the \"television tax\", because the fee was seen as the only way to protect editorial freedoms. </p> <p>Harriet Harman, the leader of the Commons, said that the government had no plans to scrap the \"very important public financial support\" for the BBC. </p> <p><strong>Penalty clauses</strong></p> <p>Lady Gardner of Parkes, the Tory peer, demanded: \"Why can there not be contracts that enclose penalty clauses as well as bonuses? The public in fact are very dissatisfied at the moment that the BBC employee who is suspended is going to earn \u00a316,000 for doing nothing on a pretty regular basis.\" </p> <p><strong>Democratic Republic of the Congo</strong></p> <p>There is a \"high level of apprehension and foreboding\" about the worsening situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Harman told MPs. </p> <p>In the Lords, Lord Malloch-Brown, the Foreign Office minister, said it was \"too early\" to know whether extra troops would have to be sent to deal with the crisis. </p> <p><strong>Assisted suicide</strong></p> <p>David Winnick (Lab, Walsall North) called for debate on the law relating to assisted suicide following the failure of a legal bid by a woman suffering from multiple sclerosis. </p> <p>Harman acknowledged \"concern\" among MPs and said there would be a further legal ruling. </p> <p><strong>Autumn</strong></p> <p>The government was repeatedly challenged over the use of the word \"autumn\" as ministers came under pressure to release their long-awaited response to a report on Equitable Life, the life insurance company that almost collapsed in 2000. </p> <p>Harman insisted the response would still be made in the autumn but ombudsman Ann Abraham had produced a \"weighty report\" following her four-year investigation and it required serious consideration. </p> <p><strong>Building</strong></p> <p>Heath said that building plots were being sold for up to \u00a318,000 in his constituency but they would \"never, ever\" have planning permission. </p> <p>He added: \"I don't know if this is illegal at the moment but it is undoubtedly a scam.\" </p> <p>Harman said she would refer the matter to the Department for Communities and Local Government but urged Heath to contact the Serious Fraud Office.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Sydney</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Luke Steele, Nick Littlemore</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> There have been a number of attempts by New Bands (of the day) over the last year to create MOR disco. Fleetwood Mac meets Chic? It's become a sort of Holy Grail. Empire of the Sun come closer than any we've heard to date. A Steely Dan or Air of a studio duo, they combine rhythmic elegance with the hi-tech sheen of 80s pop. And it's not just a theory that fails to work in practice: their songs, We Are the People, Standing on the Shore and the single and title track from their forthcoming album Walking on a Dream, are as sublimely crafted as anything we've heard all year. If Lindsey Buckingham joined forces with Daft Punk they might produce music as polished and perfect - for the bedroom, for the dancefloor - as this.</p> <p>Their songs acknowledge the past without becoming retro exercises in pastiche. Of course they don't; they are contemporary productions with elements that evoke an era that never existed - because until recently the idea of a Balearic Fleetwood Mac didn't occur. Empire of the Sun make it all sound so effortless, their music moving with the insistent mid-tempo grace of the Mac in their Tango in the Night pomp, while the singers tweak their voices in the studio to get those pristine Christine McVie harmonies just right. </p> <p>Despite the intelligence of the operation, however, it doesn't feel cold or sterile. On the contrary, the chord sequences and vocal melodies seem to have been designed for maximum emotional impact. As for the lead singer, the phrase \"controlled under-emoting\" occurs; he holds back in a series of restrained performances that give the impression he's hiding his pain over a relationship turned sour behind layers of sumptuous sonics. Because he knows that the song is greater than the sum of the parts.</p> <p>But hold on - we recognise that voice. And no wonder: it belongs to Luke Steele, the brilliant but underrated singer and songwriter with Australia's The Sleepy Jackson, whose two albums (2003's Lovers and 2006's Personality: One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird) earned them critical respect but not the widespread attention they deserved. He made a further attempt to widen his appeal last year when he teamed up with Nick Littlemore (formerly one half of Teenager with Ladyhawke's Pip Brown and more recently one half of popular Australian electro duo Pnau) for a fantastic techno tune called With You Forever. It served as a prototype for the fiction romances Steele and Littlemore have produced as Empire of the Sun, having bonded over a mutual love of Alejandro Jodorowsky's avant-garde 1973 masterpiece, The Holy Mountain, in which a Christ-like character \"withdraws from society with a flock of disciples to quest for eternal life\". </p> <p>Not for nothing have they never referred to Steele and Littlemore as the Noel and Liam of Aussietronic pop. If there's any remaining doubt about this duo's arty credentials, they shot the video for Walking on a Dream in Shanghai in lavish Technicolor, like a dazzlingly gaudy miniclip from the Spielberg extravaganza from which they take their name. We hear from a good source that Empire of the Sun's album will include future-funk workouts to shame Prince and symphonic ballads to make Brian Wilson weep. We always suspected that Steele was a major, if eccentric, talent - just wait till you see what these boys consider normal daywear. Now, finally, with Empire of the Sun, he has found the ideal vehicle for his twisted disco pop, his divine madness.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"It's the sound of two professionals geeking out on writing perfect pop songs.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> If it's as good as the tracks we've heard, then ladies and gentlemen we already have a contender for 2009 album of the year.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Seduce and destroy</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Become coke-addled millionaires</p> <p> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Walking on a Dream - the single and album - are released by Virgin in early 2009</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> Phoenix, Tahiti 80, Fleetwood Mac, Studio</p> <p>Links: <a href=\"http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2008/empire-of-the-sun-walking-on-a-dream/\">Extracts from the single</a></p> <p>Monday's new band: Dan Black</p>",
  "<p>Someone out there \u2013 and she's almost certainly not pregnant \u2013 is having a laugh. Every few months, out comes a study \u2013 the latest is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/31/women-pregnancy-alchohol-birth-defects\">published today</a> \u2013 advising mothers-to-be on whether it's safe, or not, to drink during pregnancy.</p> <p>First it was safe (my mother had the occasional drink through five pregnancies in the 1960s and 1970s without a second thought); then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/25/health.medicineandhealth\">it wasn't</a>. Then it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/oct/11/health.science\">was again</a>. Then it wasn't, with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence deciding women shouldn't drink at all for the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/mar/26/health.nhs\">three months</a>.</p> <p>Now here's another study, and a big one at that, involving 12,495 children and saying something different again. An occasional drink (one or two units a week) may actually benefit your child, it says, by reducing the risk of behavioural problems, and improving vocabulary and the ability to identify shapes, colours, letters and numbers. It's less clear whether these advantages apply to girls but, say the researchers, if you're having a boy, and you drink a little, he's in luck.</p> <p>Confused? Well, I certainly am. What's a mother-to-be to do: have an ultrasound scan to check the sex, then drink for a boy and abstain for a girl? Chances are you'll find yourself settling down with your small sauvignon (assuming it's a boy of course) in three or four months' time, only to pick up a paper telling you on no account to have an alcoholic drink (especially if it's a boy).</p> <p>Pregnant women aren't as daft as the folks on the research gravy train seem to imagine. There's a perfectly straightforward, commonsense view here, and it's this. Getting sloshed while you're pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, isn't wise. Having a couple of glasses of wine once or twice a week is absolutely fine. That was my view through my four pregnancies, and if you're pregnant yourself it is probably your view \u2013 whatever the latest research says or doesn't say. We can't, after all, raise babies (even while they're still inside us) in a risk-free environment. But mothers (and fathers) have instincts, which is how they've managed to raise their offspring successfully through hundreds and thousands of years. These endless studies serve to confuse rather than illuminate: worse, they reinforce the ideal that there's a \"perfect\" state for pregnancy and motherhood.</p> <p>Worse still, they undermine a mother's natural ability to do what's best for her baby, by attempting to tie her to some academic's apron strings rather than encouraging her to think for herself, and to trust the most vital safety net of all: her instinct.</p>",

The crazy over-enthusiasm for Halloween in my current home town means that I have been forced, for the first time in years, to think about donning a costume.

  "<p>BT has shocked investors by warning on profits and ousting the head of its underperforming IT services operation in a move that sent shares in the telecoms company to their lowest since it was floated by Margaret Thatcher's government in 1984.</p> <p>Chief executive Ian Livingston, who took over the helm just four months ago, admitted that the performance of BT Global Services had been \"particularly disappointing\" and second-quarter profits would miss City expectations as a result.</p> <p>Shareholders, meanwhile, worried that the setback could force BT to slash its dividend, which is among the most attractive in the FTSE 100. BT had pledged to increase the payout this year, but after the company said its interim payment would be frozen at last year's level, shareholders reckon its final payment could be drastically reduced. </p> <p>The fear caused a dramatic fall in BT's shares price, which plunged under the 130p level at which the company listed over two decades ago. The 19% fall - the most dramatic in the company's history - wiped more than \u00a32bn off BT's value.</p> <p>BT said Fran\u00e7ois Barrault had resigned with immediate effect to be replaced as head of BT Global Services by Hanif Lalani, the company's finance director. Barrault will receive almost \u20ac1m in compensation under his contract.</p> <p>Although BT Global Services has been successful in winning new business with major global customers such as Reuters and Unilever, costs have spiralled out of control under the 18-month leadership of the Frenchman. </p> <p>As a result, Lalani is expected to force through a raft of cost cutting which is expected to lead to job losses among BT Global Services' worldwide workforce of 37,000. A BT spokesman refused to comment on the level of potential job losses but insiders fear hundreds could be axed.</p> <p>BT Global Services was set up more than five years ago to move the company into the lucrative market for IT services. It already accounts for a sizeable chunk of the group's revenues, but its profitability has consistently failed to live up to the City's expectations. In the first quarter of this year the unit made revenues of \u00a32.2bn - more than 40% of BT's total quarterly revenues - but its profit was just \u00a3239m, compared with group profits of more than \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p>Two years ago the board set the business a \"medium term\" target of profit margins of 15%, but progress towards that has been glacial. BT admitted that its margins would be in the range of just 7% to 8% this year. Profits in the second quarter of this year, meanwhile, will be down,at \u00a3120m.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge that the performance in this part of the group is unsatisfactory and are committed to taking decisive action to rectify the situation,\" said Livingston.</p> <p>The poor performance of BT Global Services \u2014 which stands in stark contrast to the rest of the business, which is performing in line with expectations despite the economic downturn - has shattered the forecasts for the company as a whole which Livingston announced in July. At the time he said BT would increase revenue, profits before financial charges and earnings per share this year. Now it expects to increase only revenues.<br></p>",
  "<p>David Petraeus, the general who directed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> \"surge\", today takes charge of US Central Command, where he will head American military operations in the Middle East and central Asia.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/23/usa.iraq\">Petraeus</a> has signalled his priority will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>, the first country he will visit after today's swearing-in ceremony in Tampa Bay, Florida.</p> <p>Nuclear-armed Pakistan faces a growing Islamist threat, has had to ask for financial help from the International Monetary Fund, and faces impatient calls from the US to crack down on Taliban and al-Qaida militants operating from Pakistan into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>.</p> <p>Petraeus, an expert on counter-insurgency, comes into his new job credited with pulling Iraq back from the brink of disintegration. During the surge, sectarian violence fell off dramatically and the US military speaks glowingly of a newly confident Iraqi army.</p> <p>The general has been cautious about Iraq's prospects, insisting that the job is far from finished. He has said the war in Afghanistan is likely to prove even longer and harder.</p> <p>Pakistan is shaping up to be just as difficult. Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, has warned that any future terror attack on the US would come from Pakistan's western tribal regions, where the central government has little or no control. For US strategists, Pakistan may be considered a bigger immediate threat than either Iraq or Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"Dealing with Pakistan, where America's mortal foe al-Qaida is nestled alongside the Taliban, is clearly the most pressing problem we face,\" Bing West, a retired marine and former assistant secretary of defence, wrote in National Interest, the journal of international affairs and diplomacy.</p> <p>Petraeus has acknowledged Pakistan will probably be altogether different from Iraq, where his counter-insurgency tactics succeeded. \"Pakistan is going to do this on their own,\" he told rightwing thinktank the Heritage Foundation this month. \"They have a very keen sense of sovereignty.\"</p> <p>In an interview in Washington this week, a senior Pakistani official said his government was drawing up a more comprehensive strategy for fighting the insurgency, now regarded as the gravest threat to the government.</p> <p>It would be carried out in cooperation with the US, but not on a US timetable, the official said. \"We are going to run this.\"</p> <p>There is tension between the US and Pakistan over the insurgency in tribal areas. The Bush administration has stepped up sending drone aircraft to attack targets in remote border areas inside Pakistan. Resulting civilian casualties have caused uproar among Pakistanis.</p> <p>Petraeus's arrival at Central Command was not the original plan. The US secretary of defence, Robert Gates, wanted to move Petraeus from Iraq to the less demanding job of commanding US and Nato forces in Europe.</p> <p>But Admiral William Fallon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/12/usa.israelandthepalestinians\">unexpectedly announced his retirement</a> in February after a year at Central Command and Petraeus was named as his replacement.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.myrl.com/\">Myrl</a></strong> is setting out to add a bit of 'joined up thinking' to virtual worlds, building a 'social gateway' that links competing worlds with the web, and with social networks.</p> <p>Founder and chief executive <strong>Francesco D'Orazio</strong>, who has a PHD in new media and sociology from the <strong>University of Rome</strong>, describes the concept as 'outeroperability', and says the ultimate goal is to turn the series of different virtual environments into one integrated playground.</p> <p>Backed by angel funding from its launch in February 2007, Myrl employs five staff at its base on London.

We are building a layer on top of each virtual world, with the ultimate goal of linking them up to create an integrated playground with endless possibilities and applications. One of these applications is gaming, that's why we think of Myrl as a cross-world entertainment platform. We just launched our first release, the 'social gateway' for virtual worlds. Future releases will focus on immersive-storytelling and gaming across different worlds and virtual goods trading.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How does that work?</strong><br>\"We build integrations between the various virtual worlds and the Myrl web hub so that for example when you pop into your world, your avatar profile on Myrl will show your friends that you are inworld, where you are and let other users instant message you from the web to inworld. This means that when you can't run a heavy client or can't pop in for any other reason, you can still keep up with your virtual life also via the web and the mobile. Clearly the user decides whether to make what information public or private.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?</strong><br>\"Referrals and signups to the virtual worlds, social advertising, research, cross-world gaming and virtual goods trading.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your background?</strong><br>\"Technology and media studies.

  "<p>I have been writing about Christians for more than 20 years now. I am married to one; I was brought up as one, more or less. Half a dozen of the most admirable, brave and honest people I know are Christians, and I don't think for a moment that I am either smarter or better than they are. If I am right, and they are wrong, this is due to no great merit on my part. It is certainly not because I am less prone to illusion than they are, or more firmly attached to the truth. I know I can generate quite enough illusions of my own without supernatural help. </p> <p>These aren't mere preliminary throat-clearings. They are a deep and important part of the reason why I think the world would be a worse and poorer place if Christianity were to vanish from it, even though, as I say, I am not a Christian myself. Why not?</p> <p>I was brought up in a household that took religion seriously. My father, who had spent his childhood in Belfast, regarded Christianity as important but wrong. One of his earliest memories was of being pushed to the floor of a tram which was running down a street with the Protestants on one side shooting through the windows at the Catholics on the other and \u2013 ecumenically \u2013 vice versa. He still went to church in his official capacity as a diplomat, but he never for a moment supposed that a grownup could take the doctrine seriously. It had not been his observation that the meek inherited the earth or any significant part of it. Nor have I seen as a journalist anything to prove him wrong.</p> <p>My mother felt that belief was noble, church attendance a duty, and Christian ethics compelling, but she couldn't, so far as I know, believe that the story was actually true. I was sent to schools with compulsory chapel, which I disliked, though I loved the prayer book and rhythms of the King James Bible. I still do. When I was about 13, I sat a scholarship exam to a second-rate public school, and got one on the strength of what was called the \"divinity\" essay. This was my first real moment of doubt. I remember looking at the piece, after 45 minutes of frantic scribbling, and thinking \"This is very good; very powerful. But I don't have the faintest idea of whether any of it is true\"; and it seemed to me that the chaplain who praised it couldn't have any idea either. </p> <p>Later in my adolescence, I discovered <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/60952\">Jung</a>, <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/63306\">Robert Graves</a> and <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/3009570\">The Golden Bough</a> on mythology and <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/46738\">Bertrand</a> Russell's <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/8529\">essays</a>; Aldous Huxley and <a href=\"http://www.thebear.org/essays.html\">LSD </a>for high-minded mysticism. As a result, I thought myself far above any narrow little doctrines such as Christianity. I would have said then that I was spiritual, but when I grew up a little more, I came to repudiate all that kind of romanticism in favour of a grim and rationalistic sobriety. I read Gibbon and lots of Karl Popper. I came to believe that we had a duty not to believe in miracles. At the same time, I came to appreciate and to some extent understand the psychological realism of Christianity. The fact of original sin still seems to me one of the most obvious and important things about human nature, even there was no garden, and no Adam, nor an Eve. I can't believe in physical resurrections, but psychological ones keep people alive. </p> <p>When I became a religious affairs correspondent, and started to meet Christian intellectuals, I came to realise that some at least believed nothing I found abhorrent or ridiculous. They no more take the Bible as a work of history than I do. There were some with whom I could and can talk seriously in the confidence that we understand the world in almost exactly the same light and see it disfigured by the same shadows. It would be wrong and invidious to name living people, but <a href=\"http://anglicansonline.org/archive/news/articles/2000/000713a.html\">the late Lord Runcie</a> was one of the most admirable men I have ever known, and if Jesus was good enough for him that's a powerful argument.</p> <p>Yet still I won't join. In need only reread some parts of CS Lewis to know that if that hectoring certainty is right, I would rather be wrong. Most of the bishops I have known have been a sorry lot. It is hard to believe that they are right about anything much and I would certainly not wish to associate myself with the modern Church of England and all its squalid vanities. I left <a href=\"http://www.darwinwars.com/cuts/oddsnsods/lambeth/love_at_lambeth.html\">the 1998 Lambeth Conference</a> determined to do nothing which might have me mistaken for a Christian. No doubt the feeling is mutual. This wouldn't matter if they were representatives of a great tradition. But I find I can't believe in the tradition, either. Looking at what Christians have actually believed about the world, and the ways that they have in practice understood their doctrines, I know that almost every Christian now alive would have been considered a heretic 500 years ago; and that the witch-burners of the 17th century would themselves have been heretics 500 years before. </p> <p>For similar reasons, I can't accept the intellectual authority of the Roman Catholic church. Calvinism, while it it intellectually satisfying, is emotionally repugnant to me. In the end, I suppose, my objections to God are, as they must be, theological: the workings of divine providence are just a little too inaccessible to human reasoning. The problem of suffering remains insoluble. There is no possible <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy\">theodicy</a>. But I can't, either, take the Dawkinsian view that the problem of suffering is an illusion generated by the illusion of God. You can't mend the heart in a heartless world by observing that the world is in fact heartless. That's not the point.</p> <p>I suppose I end up saying that I accept the Christian account of the problem; I just can't accept Christianity's account of the solution, and so I remain, by the grace of God perhaps, an atheist.</p>",

As with Andrew Gilligan's Today programme broadcast, as with the mis-editing of The Queen, as with the various phone-in scandals, the BBC has reacted late, and extravagantly, to a mistake that needed addressing but should have been dealt with in a matter of hours.</p> </blockquote> <p>But: \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081918/Rosss-obscene-behaviour-costs-1-4m-survive-BBC-finally-wakes-decency.html\">BBC wakes up to decency</a>\", trumpets the Daily Mail, whose<br>coverage of the affair precipitated the media storm over crude on-air<br>phone calls by Ross and the comedian Russell Brand.</p> <p>Not satisfied with an editorial criticising the BBC, two of its<br>columnists, Jan Moir and Richard Littlejohn, weigh in. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1081927/LITTLEJOHN-Were-mad-hell-DONT-more.html\">In typically restrained fashion the latter writes</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>This has been a stunning victory for common decency over the self-appointed, self-obsessed, metropolitan narcissists who control so much of our public life.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Ross, who once boasted he was \"worth 1,000 BBC journalists\", has been suspended without pay for three months. Under his three-year, \u00a318m contract, it effectively fines him \u00a31.3m.</p> <p>While the BBC will hope yesterday's developments have drawn a line<br>under the story, the Mail has the smell of blood now.

It knows full well that self-harm comes before suicide, and they will be looking for every opportunity to provide the noose. And yet again, the BBC can blame no one but itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>The media frenzy over the prank call is satirised by the Beau Bo D'Or website, which <a href=\"http://www.bbdo.co.uk/blog/archives/1230\">depicts Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand as the Moors murderers</a> (with Ross as Ian Brady and Brand as Myra Hindley).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/forums/showthread.php?t=923293\">On the digitalspy web forums</a>, one poster, Wellser, wants people to complain in writing to the BBC to get Ross and Brand back on air.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think what happened was out of order, but the reaction has been so over the top.

  "<p>Wayne Rooney has been cautioned by police after spitting at a photographer. The Manchester United striker has also been forced to write a letter of apology to the victim Lee Simmons, according to the Sun.</p> <p>Rooney, 22, spat on the photographer's back as he left a restaurant in central London with his wife Coleen. The footballer was interviewed under caution after the incident which happened outside the Hakkasan Chinese restaurant in Hanway Place, near Oxford Street, on July 29. In law, deliberately spitting at someone is an offence of common assault.</p> <p>According to the report, Rooney first turned up at the police station yesterday morning but was sent away because he did not bring the letter of apology agreed as part of the settlement. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: \"A 22-year-old man attended a central London police station by prior arrangement. The man received a caution for common assault in relation to an incident which occurred in Hanway Place.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.pardonthewitches.com/content/witches\">petition calling for the posthumous pardon of women and men who were executed as witches in Britain</a> will be presented to the justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jackstraw\">Jack Straw</a>, today.<br> Campaigners hope evidence of eight grave \"miscarriages of justice\" will persuade him to take action. </p> <p>A copy of the petition will be sent to the Scottish justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill. </p> <p>More than 400 people were put to death in England for alleged witchcraft and more than 2,000 were executed in Scotland before the 1735 Witchcraft Act put an end to the trials, the campaigners said. </p> <p>Their bid to get justice for the victims follows an official pardon granted this year by the Swiss government to Anna Goeldi, who was beheaded in 1782 and is regarded as the last person executed as a witch in Europe. </p> <p>The family behind the costume firm Angels came up with the idea for the petition and asked the historian Dr John Callow to collect some of the victims' stories. </p> <p>Callow, the editor of Witchcraft and Magic in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century Europe, said it was time to recognise the witch trials as \"most dangerous and tragic\" fabrications. </p> <p>\"Today we are well aware that these individuals were neither capable of harmful magic nor in league with the devil,\" he said.<br> \"At the time, poverty was endemic, charity was breaking down and aggressive begging, accompanied by threats or curses, was common. </p> <p>\"Crops failed, butter failed to churn or cattle sickened and the blame was often settled on witches. </p> <p>\"Against such a background, judiciaries across the British Isles were compelled to act. The results were perjury and delusion on a grand scale, resulting in nothing less than legalised murder.\" </p> <p>Notorious cases mentioned in the petition include that of Agnes Sampson, executed in East Lothian, Scotland, in 1591. </p> <p>Considered a healer, she acted as midwife to the community of Nether Keith but became one of many Scottish women accused of witchcraft.<br> She initially resisted torture, even before King James VI of Scotland at Holyrood House, but finally confessed and was burned at the stake. In another case, an 80-year-old clergyman, John Lowes, was forced to conduct his own funeral service before he was hanged in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in 1645. The octogenarian was seen as too attached to the Catholic religion in a strongly Reformed area and was forced to walk for days and nights by the witch-hunter Matthew Hopkins until confessing. </p> <p>Emma Angel, who is behind the campaign, said: \"Though the law was changed hundreds of years ago and society moved on, the victims were never officially pardoned. </p> <p>\"The Swiss have led the way on this one and I really hope that we can encourage our government to follow suit.\"</p>",
  "<p>We were so shocked when our grandson developed autism. Christian was our first little boy and he had been growing up beautifully. He was meeting all his milestones \u2013 he had a large vocabulary and was almost potty-trained. Then, when my daughter and her husband had another baby and moved from the city to the country, Christian began to lose his speech. He started having tantrums. </p> <p>We went to several doctors and they said that we should remain calm and not worry. To them I was just a hysterical grandmother. They said that it was probably because of the other baby and the move. And, they said, boys regress. </p> <p>We went to five doctors and all of them said wait and see. Which, as it turns out, was the worst thing to do. With autism, time is your enemy. Early intervention and therapy are the best weapons you have. This idea that boys regress should not be allowed to persist any longer \u2013 not in these days of an autism epidemic. We lost nine months. </p> <p>Finally, we saw a team of doctors in New York who told us Christian had classic autism. I didn't know what that was \u2013 well, except for the film Rain Man. The doctors said that the rise of autism was a concern for them, and that's how our journey began and we started our organisation, <a href=\"http://www.autismspeaks.org/\">Autism Speaks</a>.</p> <p>My husband Bob and I went around the country visiting medical schools, teaching hospitals and scientists. A picture emerged that was very hard for me to understand. We went to the Centres for Disease Control, which is the arbiter of all things health-related in the US, and they told us that autism is the most significant childhood disorder in the country. </p> <p>I was astounded. When I asked them why they weren't telling more people about it, they said: \"Well, we don't want to disturb people. Paediatricians aren't sure of the diagnoses and it might just cause difficulty.\" One in 166 kids have autism \u2013 that's almost 1% of all boys. When you compare that to one in 24,000 kids with leukaemia, or one in 10,000 for Aids, or one in 7,000 for juvenile cystic fibrosis \u2013 you can see that doctors are living in a world of denial and defensiveness.</p> <p>I knew that we had to somehow raise awareness. Bob and I approached the Ad Council, which has been around in the US for about 70 years. They present government adverts and public service announcements, like forest fires and drink driving. We entered a competition to see if they would take on our campaign, and they did. They produced some of the most startling public service announcements, and these have given us enough donated money to reach out across the US. </p> <p>In most countries, autism is the most prevalent childhood disease \u2013 even more so than Aids and diabetes. And yet in both the US and UK it receives the lowest level of spending. A lot of it is because it originated in psychiatry \u2013 in the world of \"mental health\", which is not well publicised. Our aim is to get autism looked at in the light of day. </p> <p>In the US, there is an 80% divorce rate among parents of autistic children. I've seen what my own daughter had to go through every day and it's horrendous. It's so isolating. I never saw a more desperate group of people than the parents of autistic children. The costs were terrible \u2013 they had no insurance, and were discriminated against by the education and medical systems. </p> <p>We think autism is a relatively new epidemic. After all, where are all the 50-year-old autistic people? They just don't exist in these numbers. It could be genetic or there could be environmental factors. Both in the US and UK we have a big vaccine issue. We know what vaccines prevent, but do we really know their effects? </p> <p>At the moment families with autism are spending an inordinate amount of time and money to secure what they're already entitled to. If you have cancer the world takes care of you; everyone's there for you \u2013 hospitals, clinics, insurance companies. But if you have autism you have to fight for every benefit. People have to understand what their rights are and not feel that they have to beg. </p> <p>We managed to get our message to both John MacCain and Barack Obama. Both of them understand the epidemic proportions and seriousness of autism, and it was the only disease that either of them mentioned in their televised debate. </p> <p>However, while everyone tells us they are sympathetic to our cause, they all say that they have no money. It's a bit like a country club where only the members get priority. But I say that priority should be based on the prevalence of the disease. It's hard to change people's way of thinking, but that's what we at Autism Speaks have to do. We tell people that we won't be satisfied until we see spending matched with need and prevalence. Autism speaks and finally the world is listening.</p>",
  "<p>There he is looking out of an advertisement in the pages of the Guardian: James Bond, a public schoolboy with a machine gun in his hands advertising Barclaycard and Aston Martins. Was he once a member of the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordstudent.com/ht2006wk0/Features/smashing_job_chaps:_exclusive_inside_look_at_bullingdon_club\">Bullingdon Club</a> too? Probably. But where can we find an alternative James Bond, the heroic and stylish story of a hard-wearing sophisticated hero of the left?<br> How about Dale, <a href=\"http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/comment/50927\">Dr Dale T McKinley</a>? As a youth he moved to the US from his native Zimbabwe, where he trained at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranger_School\"> Ranger school</a>, the US equivalent of the SAS. He went on to get a PhD in Politics and while he was studying for it he travelled to El Salvador where he was with the <a href=\"http://ftp.fas.org/irp/world/para/fmln.htm\">Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front</a> (FMLN) and used his military skills to defend village communities. Back in North Carolina Dale became incensed when he heard the CIA were recruiting at his university. He had seen the CIA's Felix Leiters at work in Central America and hated them. With colleagues he hunted them down and physically threw the recruiting agents off campus. Later, the Ku Klux Klan put out a death warrant on Dale after a demonstration where he and colleagues torched the Confederate flag in the face of the Invisible Knights.<br> In the 1980s Dale went to Palestine, Jordan, Egypt and Kashmir where he was an active observer of the political conflicts taking place in those countries. In the early 90s he went to Mozambique to assist villagers in the countryside who were under constant threat of attack from the bloodthirsty <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/renamo.htm\">RENAMO</a>, the Magnificent One.<br> Dale is lithe and well-muscled, his skin has turned nut brown from the African sun. In fact he looks like a very dashing young version of George Galloway. Whenever I see him he has a beautiful woman on each arm; but thinking, independent minded, high achieving women, not Bond bimbos.</p> <p>Recently when the Zimbabwean immigrants were under attack in South Africa, Dale joined communities gathered in the <a href=\"http://apf.org.za/\">Anti-Privatisation Forum</a> to to protect them. Together, they rescued the Zimbabweans from rampaging mobs.</p> <p>Dale's philosophy is rather more inspiring than Bond's:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We are all human beings. Our main challenge as humans is to overcome and transcend all the various constructed 'identities' (national, racial, ethnic, religious, linguistic, etc) that create and sustain conflict/violence, greed/ inequality and artificially divide us. The struggle we must wage is one to universalise our human commonness of basic needs and desires and in the process free ourselves from the bondages of self-constructed economic, social and political/ideological exploitation and oppression. We can change ourselves and all the worlds we live in only if we believe we can.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> Now that is my kind of man of Action, no Barclaycard, no machine gun, no tailored City boy suit. Shame about the Aston Martin though.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/enter.html\">BioShock</a>, a video-game that came out last year, offered a particularly detailed and vivid depiction of a familiar science-fiction trope: innovation run amok. The game is set in an underwater city, called Rapture, which was established by a wealthy businessman called Andrew Ryan to escape the restrictions imposed by governments on companies, scientists and individuals. His name is a nod to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)\">Ayn Rand</a>, and the whole game is steeped in references to her libertarian philosophy of Objectivism which, among other things, advocates a raw, unbridled form of laissez-faire capitalism.</p> <p>Of course, the game would be no fun at all if things did not go horribly wrong, reducing the inhabitants of the city who become hooked on new genetic enhancements to a race of crazed zombies. The game is a recent addition to a long tradition of stories, dating back to \"Frankenstein\", warning of the dark side of innovation: that new inventions can pose grave danger if their creators prove unable to control them. </p> <p>From drug trials that go wrong to nuclear waste to the current financial crisis \u2013 caused in part by over-enthusiasm for elaborate new financial instruments that did not behave as their inventors expected \u2013 you might be forgiven for concluding that innovation is often more trouble than it is worth. How can you tell if the risks are really worth the rewards?</p> <p>When it comes to financial innovation, the jury is still out on that one. But it is worth remembering that innovation is not merely a process that provides people with the option to buy a slightly better iPod every year. Innovation in products, processes and services is also a big factor (perhaps the main factor) <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/49/34267902.pdf\">underpinning economic growth</a>, accounting for 85% of growth by some calculations. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking example of this process is to be found in the impact of mobile phones in the developing world. In places with bad roads and poor land lines, they substitute for travel, allow price information to be distributed more quickly and easily, enable traders to reach wider markets and generally ease the business of doing business. Leonard Waverman of the London Business School has estimated that an extra 10 mobile phones per 100 people in a typical developing country leads to 0.5% growth in GDP per person. A clear illustration of how the spread of mobile phones promotes economic growth comes from the experience of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9149142\"><br>fishermen in Kerala</a>. Equipped with mobile phones, they can call coastal markets while still at sea to determine where to sell their catch. This increases their incomes, reduces waste and improves the supply of fish for customers.</p> <p>The Economist celebrates helpful innovations of this kind with an <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10676339\"><br>annual awards ceremony</a>, being held this week, that recognises the people behind them. Spotting helpful innovations is easy in retrospect, of course; it is determining how to handle a new idea in the first place that is more difficult. Innovations are neither inherently good or bad; it is what people do with them (and what governments allow people to do) that counts. Sometimes, as with mobile phones, a light regulatory touch is needed; in other cases, as with drugs, nuclear power or exotic financial derivatives, regulators must exercise closer control. </p> <p>Moreover, there have been plenty of innovations over the years in the field of regulating innovation, from double-blind clinical trials to computer-modelling of new aircraft designs. When it comes to finance, more such regulatory innovation is clearly needed at the moment. And in general, if mankind is to address the many problems it faces, it needs more innovation, not less.</p>",
  "<p>Until the blog drifted into a lengthy (and enjoyably informative) discussion about Finnish cuisine and Scotch bonnets, last week's afternoon-themed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/readersrecommend\">RR</a> was the quietest in months. We haven't seen such slim pickings since spring was the theme: perhaps rule number three in the songwriting handbook is: don't be too specific about the time or the season. I expect this week's theme, songs about travelling, to generate a lot more traffic. Dear me, that's a dreadful pun.</p> <p>For all that it was nominated last week, I suspect there will be many people horrified by the inclusion of Afternoon Delight on the A-list. For my money, it's a terrible song in many ways, but I've long had immense affection for the chorus, which has now been stuck in my head for a week without driving me insane - a song has to have something going for it to pull that off.</p> <p>Otherwise, this was another of those irritating weeks when I had to lose one of my all-time favourite songs from the playlist because I couldn't think how to work it into the column. Mark Mulcahy's In the Afternoon instead kicks off the non-tea section of the B-list, which continues with Jonathan Richman's magical Afternoon, Pulp's Acrylic Afternoons, Jandek's unsettling Naked in the Afternoon and Patti Smith's Redondo Beach. Next up is Lazy Afternoon: it should have been on the A-list, but (with apologies to goneforeign for this bit of incompetence) I failed to hear the June Christy version until after my print deadline had passed, and Sarah Vaughan was on a playlist just a couple of weeks ago.</p> <p>Incidentally, several wonderful jazz instrumentals were suggested - notably by Stan Getz, Stan Kenton and Lester Young - but I decided since it was apparently easier to convey an afternoon atmosphere in music than words, the playlist would be dedicated to lyricists. Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune is on the B-list for the same absurd reason.</p> <p>The last three songs comprise a miniature T-list (thanks to Tatanka for this lovely idea): Shack's Cup of Tea, Tea for Two in the Bud Powell or Thelonius Monk version (I can't decide!), and the Kinks' Afternoon Tea.</p> <p>No room anywhere for Sunny Afternoon, then. Honestly, I'm rubbish at this.</p> <p>Unfortunately, all my favourite discoveries this week were songs I couldn't actually hear: they were the seven tracks suggested by Proudfoot shortly before the deadline on Monday. If I'd been playing, I might once again have indulged my love of obscure American indie by nominating The Walk by the Aislers Set, chiefly for the baleful verse: \"You woke up at 3pm and showered for hours, watched porn all alone for the evening, it never really got you anywhere except back in the shower.\"</p> <p>Moving swiftly on: this week's theme, travelling, was among Steenbeck's suggestions last week, and is one of Dorian's leftovers, too. In an attempt to keep this list under some kind of control, I'm going to impose the rule that an actual journey must be undertaken in the song. That said, I don't want to rule instrumentals out, so I hope there will be some music that conveys the sense of travelling and journeys. </p> <p>Deadline is midday Monday; please don't post more than one-third of a song's lyrics.

  "<p>Daniel Craig's difficult second album in the role of 007 has turned out to be a concept album. And that concept is rage. When we left the agent at the end of Casino Royale, the great man was hurting. His love, Vesper Lynd, had betrayed him, apparently, and his heart was broken. The icy cynicism, the flippant mannerisms and the womanising: it is all to anaesthetise that primal agony. Now he's out for revenge and Bond has gone over the edge - and over the top. </p> <p>His ostensible mission is to crack a secret society of apolitical baddies, called Quantum; their key player, Dominic Greene, is played by French character actor Mathieu Amalric, a man with humorously crazy eyes and teeth of quasi-British dodginess. Greene is a super-rich businessman out to buy vast swathes of real estate, so he can control the water supply of an entire continent. Bond must take him down. </p> <p>But it's all a cover. What Bond really wants is revenge on this man who stole his love. M, played by Dame Judi Dench, is furious with Bond as he starts topping and whacking people right, left and centre, without maintaining proper discipline. MI6 decides it must cut Bond loose, because he's gone rogue - like Sarah Palin, only with less expensive clothes. The very first sequence shows Bond driving recklessly around a classic Italian hillside, firing guns and crashing, and Craig appears to be doing a fair bit of stunt driving himself. He does some unattractive grimacing that makes him look like Sid James.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339172322\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1889954398_gdn-nat-YYMMDD-sf-mark-forster-01-VFa-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>I have to confess that this second Bond adventure disappointed me a little: it's not nearly as smart as Craig's debut. There is not much storyline or romance - although there is some hotel-suite action with a sexy British agent called Fields, played by Gemma Arterton, who greets Bond at the airport apparently wearing nothing but a raincoat, like some sort of MI6 stripogram. (And incidentally, the objection I levelled at Casino Royale remains in force. Why on earth is the classic Bond theme tune saved until the end?)</p> <p>What Quantum of Solace does have is Daniel Craig. No one could deny Craig's charisma, and the effortless way he has inhabited the role. He has some spectacular action sequences and a fair few close-quarter punch-ups in the manner of Bourne, along with some athletic rooftop-leaping chase scenes that Bonds of an earlier vintage would have rejected as being too much like hard work. </p> <p>Yet I can't quite accept the criticism that Bond here is just a glorified hit-man who never does any real intelligence work. There is an ingenious scene in which Bond is one of thousands of tuxedoed types at the opera, eavesdropping on the secret long-distance pow-wow the villains are having through special earpieces: 007 finds a droll way of getting them to reveal themselves so he can take covert photographs on his mobile phone.</p> <p>Quantum of Solace isn't bad, but from now on, Craig's Bond has to be a real character with something real at stake, however absurd. Otherwise we're going to return to the franchise production line. That would be an awful shame.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, the Russian oligarch who entertained the business secretary, Lord Mandelson, and the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, on his yacht in Corfu this summer, was denied a visa to the US due to his alleged \"criminal associations and relationships\", the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>A senior former state department official said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\">US</a> officials who considered Deripaska's case in 1998 believed he was associated with several <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russians</a> involved in organised crime, including Anton Malevsky, head of the notorious Ismailovskaya Brotherhood. Others believed by the US authorities to be his associates were involved in the so-called Aluminium Wars during the mid-1990s which resulted in dozens of killings. Deripaska has always strenuously denied any links to organised crime.</p> <p>The state department official said: \"There are four grounds that are relevant in Deripaska's case. Number three is, does this person have criminal associations and relationships? That's the one that applied to Deripaska.\"</p> <p>Last night Mandelson declined to comment on whether he had checked the reasons for the US's decision to deny Deripaska a visa before he associated with him. Mandelson has said previously that he first met Deripaska in Moscow in October 2004 before further meetings while he was the EU trade commissioner.</p> <p>A source close to Deripaska said the accusation that he had criminal associations was \"without foundation, being driven by the partial view of those with interest in undermining the reputation of Mr Deripaska.\"</p> <p>In 2000, Deripaska was keen to launch his company Rusal on the London Stock Exchange but was worried that his US visa ban would deter investors. To improve his image, he employed the former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who was working for a Washington law firm, Allston and Bird, to lobby the state department and other agencies on his behalf.</p> <p>Dole succeeded and Deripaska was allowed into the US for a brief visit in December 2000, when he gave lectures at Harvard University and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. During the trip, he was interviewed by the FBI, which led to a second ban on his entering the US that is still in force today.</p> <p>Yesterday Deripaska became the beneficiary of Russian state aid aimed at businesses which are struggling as a result of the credit crunch to repay foreign loans taken on to finance their expansion. The government approved a $4.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) loan for Rusal, which must repay a syndicate of 11 western banks including Royal Bank of Scotland and Merrill Lynch by today.</p> <p>Banking sources said VEB, the state-owned Russian development bank, was likely to demand ownership of Deripaska's 25% stake in Norilsk Nickel if the loan was not repaid by the end of 2009.</p>",
  "<p>She had no doubt taken precautions against sunburn and been warned about timeshare touts. But nothing could have prepared Mary Corcoran for the attack by a vulture on her Tenerife holiday.</p> <p>The 56-year-old from Ipswich told yesterday of how she feared she was going to be eaten alive when the metre-long griffon vulture pinned her to the ground while she was watching a birds of prey show on the island.</p> <p>She was taken to hospital after the vulture swooped down and attacked her and her friend Teresa Largent at Tenerife's Jungle Park zoo.</p> <p>The vulture, which has a wingspan of 2.5 metres (8ft), was eventually punched to the ground by its keeper. The attack was unusual because vultures normally only feast on dead animals.</p> <p>The attack happened on Sunday as the women's week-long holiday was coming to an end. They were watching the show in the park's arena when one vulture flew from its perch and down to where the women were sitting.</p> <p>\"We had been told not to move, so we sat totally still, but it pecked Teresa and then nicked her programme,\" said Corcoran, who is retired, yesterday from her home in Kesgrave, Suffolk. \"Then the bird went for me, and perched on my shoulder, and before I knew it, I was under it.\"</p> <p>Griffon vultures weigh between six and 13kg (1-2st); the weight of the bird pinned Corcoran down and she began to feel a burning sensation down her back and arm as its claws dug into her skin.</p> <p>\"The keeper came over and got the bird away but as he was taking me out of the arena it flew back towards me and the keeper had to thump it really hard to the ground,\" she said. \"That is when the real fear and panic set it as I thought it was coming back to eat me. I was freaking out. I thought, 'I'm not a dead carcass!'\"</p> <p>She was then taken to hospital where she received antibiotics and a tetanus jab. After her wounds were dressed, she was sent back to her hotel in a wheelchair. \"I was shaking and shaking and shaking,\" she said. \"I couldn't speak about it for a few days afterwards. Every time someone asked me what happened I started crying. I've never known any shock like it.\"</p> <p>She said she was hoping to claim compensation from the zoo for what she described as its \"negligence\".</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Jungle Park said: \"The animals are free so we cannot control what they will do, because they are animals. I have only heard of this thing happening maybe twice in 15 years. The keepers are working with them every day and have insurance for that.\"</p> <p>Grahame Madge, of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said the vultures \"look like barn doors coming towards you, so it's no wonder [the women] were frightened. But they are not usually at all dangerous for humans. They are nature's waste disposal units - usually they are just carrion feeders.\"</p> <p>The Jungle Park, in Las Aguilas, south Tenerife, has two birds of prey shows a day, giving visitors the chance to see falcons, vultures and eagles in free flight.</p>",
  "<h2>Golfer Monty shrugs off Vettriano 'breasts' taunt</h2> <p>The golfer Colin Montgomerie yesterday laughed off artist Jack Vettriano's claims that he refused a commission to paint him because he does not \"do men with breasts\". The painter reportedly rejected a request to produce the work for the National Galleries of Scotland. But Montgomerie's manager Guy Kinnings hit back, saying the golfer had never heard of Vettriano. He said: \"Colin himself just laughed about it.

Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, 24, of Birmingham, unwittingly triggered a tripwire during the mission. He said: \"I thought that the best course of action for everyone including myself was to lie right next to the grenade, point my body armour towards it with my day sack and take the brunt of the explosion.\" He received only minor injuries.

  "<p>The musical presence of Steve Gray, who has died aged 64, was transforming but subtle and unobtrusive. As a session keyboard player in the 1970s, he played for Quincy Jones, Henry Mancini, Michel Legrand, Lalo Schifrin, Peggy Lee, Sammy Davis Jr, John Barry and many others, but he never regarded himself as a creative pianist and was shy of the role in the presence of the jazz players he loved. </p> <p>In the 1980s he was the keyboardist in the guitarist John Williams' crossover band Sky - participating in several hit albums - but played down his part. After he left Sky, his achievements might well surprise those who had only glimpsed his presence in the shadows. He wrote a guitar concerto for Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra in 1988, a piano concerto for the French jazz-piano legend Martial Solal, two operas and a requiem mass, orchestrated Brian Eno's works in collaboration with the composer, and much more. From 1991, he worked with the North German Radio (NDR) Big Band in Hamburg, conceiving with them a project devoted to the music of the South African Abdullah Ibrahim.</p> <p>Gray was born in Middlesbrough and began to teach himself the piano at the age of 10. He played bassoon in the Middlesbrough Municipal Junior Orchestra but gravitated to the saxophone section under the direction of Ron Aspery, who later founded the groundbreaking Yorkshire fusion trio Back Door. Gray's ears were already teaching him all he needed. In his early teens, attending a Duke Ellington concert with Aspery, he began transcribing the music he had heard while on the bus on the way home.</p> <p>He eventually became a pit pianist at the Middlesbrough Empire, moved to London in the early 1960s, and joined a quartet led by the great British bop drummer Phil Seamen. Typically, he felt that he was lucky to get the gig and feared that Seamen would rumble his shortcomings. Gray then joined the bands of Eric Delaney, Johnny Howard and Mike Cotton, and by the late 1960s was working on studio sessions. Exploring composition, he wrote background music for movies, radio and TV, and released A Woman in Love (1969), an album of his own pieces. Within a few years he was running his own quintet, Wasp, with ex-Shadows drummer Brian Bennett and saxophonist-composer Duncan Lamont, and recording an incidental melange of light funk, classical, disco, Latin, jazz and electronics for the KPM company. </p> <p>Gray's expertise blossomed. He arranged Jonathan Hodge's score for the Richard Burton film Villain (1971), and his sense of harmony and texture led him to reshape the Walker Brothers sound on their comeback albums No Regrets (1975) and Lines (1976). He also accompanied Olivia Newton-John for the 1974 Eurovision song contest, as well as Petula Clark and Tom Jones.</p> <p>Gray disliked performing in public, but an invitation in 1980 to join Sky for a performance in Westminster Abbey and an Australian tour was too hard to resist. He composed Singer (1986), with Georgie Fame, for the Holland Metropole Orchestra, which also played Gray's arrangements of Eno's music from the album The Shutov Assembly. He composed two works for the W11 Opera in London for young people and an adaptation of Emilio de Cavalieri's 1599 work Rappresentazione di Anima e di Corpo for the Cologne Opera House.</p> <p>It was after vocalist and composer Norma Winstone invited him to write settings for her atmospheric songs that he began working with the NDR Big Band. Gray had written some big-band arrangements for Winstone some years before, and the singer was startled by his appreciation of lyrics. \"I suggested swapping eight-bar phrases with the band on Easy to Love,\" Winstone later remarked, \"and he said 'oh, but that would bring you back in the middle of a sentence'. He was right, of course.\" </p> <p>Gray wrote an arrangement for Winstone's haunting account of The Peacocks, written by former Billie Holiday pianist Jimmy Rowles, and played piano on the recording. \"That pianist really knows what he's doing,\" the vastly experienced Rowles said.</p> <p>Winstone's invitation led to the NDR's Kurt Giese suggesting a Duke Ellington project to Gray in 1991, and the NDR ball began to roll. The partnership has included the Ekapa Lodumo album with Ibrahim in 2001 and a requiem mass for big band and choir. In 1998, Gray was guest professor of composition and arrangement in the Berlin Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Hanns Eisler jazz department. </p> <p>The composer's untapped potential was immense, and the NDR offered him freedoms he had never known before. His old playing partner Duncan Lamont once opined that his wit, wisdom and otherworldly intuitions made him seem \"1,000 years old\". The bassist Chris Laurence, asking the self-taught Gray where he got his eerily voiced chords from, was told: \"I didn't know the right ones.\"</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Heather, his daughter Suzanne, and grand-daughter Anna.</p> <p>\u2022 Steve Gray, musician, born April 18 1944; died September 20 2008</p>",
  "<p>Tony Hillerman's 18 mystery novels, set in the Navajo lands of south-west America, earned him first a cult following and later best-seller status. But for Hillerman, who has died aged 83, the greatest honour was being named in 1987 a special friend of the Dineh, this being the Navajo's word for the people, or themselves. </p> <p>The strength of his books lies in their sympathy with the culture they detail. Hillerman's stories often feature conflicts between the American legal system and traditional Navajo definitions of crimes or criminals. Concepts of tribal harmony often transcend the law, and the Navajo are often far more sensitive to moral weakness than the white society that surrounds them. \"I'd like people to see the strength and dignity of a culture I admire,\" said Hillerman, who was especially concerned in his later books with the \"negative value\" Navajo culture places on greed, or acquiring more of anything than you need. </p> <p>He grew up during the Depression on a small farm in Sacred Heart, Oklahoma. He was sent to the nearest school, which happened to be a mission school primarily for Potawatomi Indian girls. After a year at university, he enlisted in the US army and took part in the D-day landings. He won both the silver and bronze stars for valour, and a Purple Heart after he was wounded severely by a mine.</p> <p>He graduated from Oklahoma University in 1948 and married Marie Unzner, with whom he had one child and adopted five more. A journalist reporting Hillerman's wartime experiences had recommended, after reading his letters home, that he consider writing. He took up this advice and worked as a reporter and editor on newspapers in Borger, Texas and Lawton, Oklahoma, before becoming United Press International's political reporter in Oklahoma City. </p> <p>He moved as UPI bureau chief to Santa Fe, and then, for nearly 10 years, edited that city's leading paper, the New Mexican. But he explained later that \"you needed to take a vow of poverty to be a journalist in the old days\", and in 1963 he enrolled at the University of New Mexico, working as an assistant to the president while studying for his MA in English. He then taught journalism at the university for more than 20 years.</p> <p>In his spare time he wrote his first novel, The Blessing Way (1970), featuring Lt Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo tribal police. As well as his own experience, Hillerman drew on the pre-war Australian novels of Arthur Upfield, featuring the half-Aboriginal detective Napoleon Bonaparte. Nevertheless, his first literary agent advised him to \"get rid of the Indian stuff\". His second novel, The Fly on the Wall (1971), was set in the seamy world of state politics. It is a much-underrated book, not least by Hillerman himself. He returned to Leaphorn with Dance Hall of the Dead (1973), which received the best novel Edgar award from the Mystery Writers of America.</p> <p>People of Darkness (1980) introduced Sgt Jim Chee, younger than Leaphorn and studying to become a hataali, or shaman. When Hillerman brought Leaphorn and Chee together, in Skin-walkers (1986), the contrasting attitudes and generations showed him at his most perceptive and compassionate. It became a bestseller and won a Spur award from the Western Writers of America. The follow-up, A Thief of Time (1988), his personal favourite and a number one bestseller, won a Nero Wolfe award, and his excellent memoir, Seldom Disappointed (2001), won an Agatha Christie award. He also wrote two children's books and a number of non-fiction books about the American south-west, as well as editing numerous anthologies.</p> <p>In 1991 Robert Redford produced a disappointing film of The Dark Wind (1982), starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Fred Ward as Chee and Leaphorn. Starting in 2002, the US PBS network made three television movies, with Adam Beach and Wes Studi more convincing in the roles. Hillerman's last novel, The Shape Shifter, was published in 2006. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and six children. </p> <p><strong>Mike Ripley writes: </strong>Tony Hillerman was a distinctive figure in crime fiction, using the police procedural form to describe in sympathetic detail not just the stunning geography of Arizona and New Mexico, but also the religions, cultures and value systems of the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni peoples. It was said that he wrote of the people and places of the south-west as they were, not as they appeared to outsiders. </p> <p>Although his books were thought somewhat \"preachy\" by some critics, there was no denying his passion for dispelling the accumulated ignorance about Native American mysticism and religion. He would sign copies of his books with the Navajo blessing Hozho!, urging his readers to be in balance with their natural surroundings. No one seemed to have a bad word for him - in English or Navajo.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Grove Hillerman, writer, born May 27 1925; died October 26 2008</p>",
  "<h2>Parliament votes to ban porn despite opposition</h2> <p>Indonesia's parliament passed a bill banning pornography yesterday, ignoring opposition from lawmakers and civil rights groups worried that it will be used to justify attacks on religious and cultural freedom. More than 100 MPs stormed out ahead of the vote, saying that \"while the bill's final version removed contentious clauses regulating dress and social behaviour\", it went against the country's tradition of diversity. The final version focuses instead on the dissemination of material containing pornographic images, gestures or even conversations.

There was no claim of responsibility but officials pointed the finger at the militant Basque separatist group Eta. They said the blast could have caused huge bloodshed because it went off in a busy part of the campus. Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, interior minister, said: \"Whoever placed the bomb gave a warning and either intentionally did not give all the information or made a mistake.\" The blast follows the recent arrest of suspected Eta members in Pamplona. <br><strong>Associated Press, Madrid</strong></p> <h2>Internet firewall to block websites insulting to king</h2> <p>Thailand is to build a national internet firewall to block websites deemed insulting to the monarchy.

Last year the government blocked the YouTube website for weeks for hosting a clip showing a picture of the king with a pair of women's feet suspended above his head.

One spring has been protected. </p> <h2>Goal: Train mechanics</h2> <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Two pump <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/feb/07/projectgoals.water\">technicians</a></strong> have been trained and are now working to repair and maintain community boreholes and clean water supplies</p> <h2>Goal: Rainwater tanks in schools</h2> <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Five plastic <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/mar/04/water.education\">water tanks</a></strong> and corresponding gutter lines have been installed in schools facing particularly dire water shortages - Ojago, Oimai, Merok, Ajonyi and Adamasiko primary schools. The tanks harvest rainwater, which can then be used and safely drunk by pupils.</p> <h2>Goal: Toilets in schools and homes</h2> <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Sanitation kits including 240 tools, such as wheelbarrows and spades to help dig pit latrines in communities have been distributed to six parishes. New latrine blocks have been built at Amorikot school.</p> <h2>Goal: Hygiene promotion</h2> <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Amref has trained people in all Katine parishes to make \"sanplats\" \u2013 <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/18/health.livelihoods\">sanitation platforms</a></strong> for latrines that help reduce the risk of worm-related infection.</p> <h2>Goal: Form water source committees</h2> <p><strong>Achievement:</strong> Twenty community water source <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/video/2008/aug/12/video.water\">committees</a></strong> have been formed from the local community, four for boreholes that existed before the project.</p>",
  "<p>So far, the Katine project has been both a challenge and a great opportunity to see how far we can work alongside farmers to improve <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/livelihoods\">livelihoods</a></strong> on the ground.</p> <p>One of the pressures staff on the ground face is trying to identify quick and tangible achievements. </p> <p>The reality is that helping to develop and improve the livelihoods of local farmers is a slow and complicated process. We can't drill a borehole and instantly see clean water. The work we are doing putting structures in place on which farmers can build takes a lot of time to reap dividends. The time allocated for this project might not even be sufficient for us to see many tangible or immediate benefits.</p> <p>Although we can't point to wells dug or schools built, one of the most significant achievements of the livelihoods component is that we now have strong and workable partnerships with Amref and local and national government and non-governmental partners in place, and a network of local farmers groups established across Katine.</p> <p>Months of hard work and negotiation have gone into forging these partnerships. When we approach local government workers, it's hard to sell the idea that our involvement on the ground will mean adding extra roles and responsibilities to their existing jobs. We're basically saying to everyone that we want you to do this without extra pay, and in the long-term local people will benefit.</p> <p>However, I believe we are now at a point where we have found working arrangements where everyone has a role and where the communities themselves are beginning to engage directly with the local government staff and officials. If managed properly these relationships could remain in place for years to come.</p> <h2>Cassava trials</h2> <p>Our work with farmer groups, carrying out trials of a new, more productive and disease-resistant strain of cassava in 18 demonstration plots across Katine will reap dividends next year.</p> <p>The decision to focus on this one new strain of <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/29/livelihoods.projectgoals\">cassava</a></strong> was the outcome of a long process of research alongside farmers groups in Katine, where we fixed on what new crops would be the best suited to the area and would be most productive at feeding families and selling.</p> <p>Currently the groups are planting for a harvest in March 2009 and, as we're now having good rains, the prospects are good.</p> <p>As we wait for the harvest we are already thinking about building warehouses for storage and processing and identifying links to some of the bigger marketplaces to sell produce at a fair price.</p> <p>If the groups are going to develop crops, have their own warehouses and take their business to new markets, then developing a working culture of saving and investing as a community is one of the key goals going forward.</p> <p>So far, 18 village savings and loans associations have been formed and are already collectively saving and distributing small loans to members. Some groups have savings of up to 400,000 Uganda shillings ($205), most of which is lent out to members, so I'm optimistic about our ability to build on this in the coming year.</p> <h2>Stumbling block</h2> <p>A big stumbling block in this first year has been the problems we've had improving the health of livestock by training community animal health workers in Katine. Farm-Africa has done this very successfully in other countries across Africa - especially in marginal areas where trained private or government vets are not available - and we were hoping to replicate this success in Katine. </p> <p>However, here we have hit a policy snag. The Ugandan government will not allow us to train local people, saying there are sufficient numbers of unemployed and certified animal health workers to be able to service communities in Katine. Any additional training we provide should go to those animal health workers already trained by the government.</p> <p>For us, this presents certain complications. External animal health workers coming into remote communities rarely stay and are almost never accepted by community members.</p> <p>It also means we are being asked to train people from outside the local group structure, which we believe is a crucial factor in empowering Katine residents to take control of their own livelihoods. We've been working with the government's veterinary department, which has been very cooperative, and we're working to come up with a practical solution.</p> <p>We are also wrestling with the tricky issue of oxen. Oxen are what most farmers in Katine feel they need the most to improve their working lives and to develop livelihoods. Farm-Africa has always worked on the belief that simply giving farmer's livestock as handouts is inappropriate and doesn't create any sense of ownership.</p> <p>However, the argument isn't so cut and dry in Katine. Villages lost many of their animals in the rebel raids five years ago and have suffered from a dire lack of veterinary services, which has seen remaining livestock dwindle.</p> <p>When any community is hit by tragedy, emergency relief can and should be provided and there is an argument put forward by some development workers that restocking cattle is a valid form of relief to help a community get back on its feet. In Katine we still believe the case isn't clear.</p> <h2>Food prices</h2> <p>One unexpected problem has been how to deal with the catastrophic impact that the rising cost of food and fuel is having on farmers. The cost of food has tripled for some farmers, with some having to cut daily meals in half and reserving the produce they have for home consumption rather than selling at the market. This, in effect, reduces their household income.</p> <p>The long-term impact of these increases is yet to be seen, but it's something that everyone involved in the Katine project must be prepared to battle against.</p> <p>\u0095 Charles Marwa was talking to Annie Kelly</p>",
  "<p>A group of children from our village school are being taken up to Kielder to stay in a hostel there to explore this lovely area for a few days. It will be an invigorating and interesting trip for them. Extending from the Scottish border, for six miles on either side of the Deadwater Burn, Kielder Forest forms one of the biggest single Forestry Commission schemes in England; the plantations are mainly sitka and Norway spruce, with a mixture of pine. </p> <p>The centre of this beautiful place is the village of Kielder, which is ringed by the Cheviot hills, at the junction of the streams forming the North Tyne river. A road connects the moors between England and Scotland; this probably started as just a sandy hill path connecting the two valleys, and will have been improved since I walked it with my father many years ago. Near the village is Kielder Castle, which was built in 1775 as a shooting box for the Duke of Northumberland, and I hope the children will be taken there for an unforgettable visit.</p> <p>A relic of early days is a heap of stones called the Devil's Lapful. I was told by a warden at the castle that it was a prehistoric burial mound, and that flint arrows have been found in the Kielder Burn. Now the Forestry Commission wants to install a 16ft-high timber artwork in the shape of a human head near the northern shore of Kielder Water, and they have other similar pieces planned for this beautiful lake's shoreline. Understandably, this is causing controversy. Shelters to be built on both the north and south shorelines are also in the planning stage. These would be used by both walkers and cyclists, and I think they will be welcomed by the many visitors who enjoy this Northumberland beauty spot.</p>",

  "<p>There is much of the cold assassin about Andy Murray's current play. His emotions are under almost perfect control, apart from the few odd mutterings, and he goes about his business with a poise and purpose that reinforces his position as the fourth best player in the world. And if yesterday's 6-3, 7-6 victory over Spain's Fernando Verdasco was something of a grind, then today's quarter-final against David Nalbandian, defending the Paris Masters title, has the potential to be an outstanding contest of high-class shot-making.</p> <p>The two have met only once before, with the Argentinian winning from two sets down 3\u00bd years ago at Wimbledon, the first time that Murray played on Centre Court. That was an extraordinary match as Murray, making his All England Club debut as a callow 18-year-old, and ranked outside the top 300, dominated the opening, with much gesturing and many roars of delight, only to run out of adrenaline and suffer from cramp. \"It was one of the best matches of that year for me, and the first time I had played a top, top player,\" Murray said after his victory over Verdasco. \"But there is a big difference between me now and who I was then.\"</p> <p>Up until this year's Wimbledon, and including the fourth-round Centre Court victory over France's Richard Gasquet, Murray's matches were frequently imbued with a large element of the dramatic. It seemed intrinsic to his nature. Now a quiet and calculating professionalism pervades, those emotional eruptions having been contained within a carapace of strict control born of complete on- and off-court confidence.</p> <p>Murray knows his worth. He knows that being ranked behind only Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic has won him the respect of fellow professionals and given him a solid base to achieve his goal of winning a grand slam title. This was his 14th consecutive victory, a run that has encompassed back-to-back tournament victories at the Madrid Masters and the St Petersburg Open. And should he win the title this week, he would become the first man ever to win three consecutive Masters Series events.</p> <p>That is a level that neither Tim Henman nor Greg Rusedski came close to achieving, though Murray remains loth to make comparisons. Such runs of success - and it is 34-4 since the French Open - need ultimately to be relished during quiet moments of reflection.</p> <p>Nalbandian, the 2002 Wimbledon runner-up, has the ability to bring the run to an end for on this court last year he defeated Federer and Nadal. It is a challenge that Murray will relish. \"David is arguably a better player than when I met him at Wimbledon. It's not like he had a bad year but because he hasn't done that well in the slams people tend to think he is not playing particularly well,\" he said. \"He picks his schedule very well and is usually fresher than the other players at the end of the year, when he plays great.\"</p> <p>Last year Nalbandian won the Madrid and Paris Masters and yesterday he defeated his fellow Argentinian Juan Martin del Potro 6-4, 6-0.</p> <p>After playing his previous match on the main court, Murray found himself relegated to Court One, a small and cramped arena with a ceiling so comparatively low that many of today's towering players might feel the need to duck. Such was the lurch from one to another that is seemed as if the Masters has suddenly been transformed into an obscure minor event with only a few hundred watching. \"I was just amazed how fast the court was compared to the Centre,\" he said.</p> <p>The serve dominated, with only one break point in the match. This came shortly after Verdasco had received an appalling call when 40-0 up and was serving to level at 4-4. His forehand was clearly in but called out. And there was no Hawk-Eye. The Spaniard imploded horribly to lose the set. Thereafter Murray appeared a shade weary, falling behind in the tie-break before Verdasco missed a simple overhead for a 6-4 lead, and then did not win another point.</p> <p>Earlier Andy Roddick clinched his place at the Tennis Masters Cup with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Gilles Simon of France to join Nadal, Federer, Djokovic, Murray and Nikolay Davydenko. Two places remain open.</p>",
  "<p>Tottenham Hotspur's chairman, Daniel Levy, said yesterday that he had taken the \"drastic\" decision to sack Juande Ramos because he believed that the coach had lost the respect of key players.</p> <p>Levy acted on Saturday, bringing in Harry Redknapp after Spurs lost 2-0 at Udinese 48 hours earlier in the Uefa Cup, a tie they finished with 10 men. Previously they had lost at Stoke City, finishing with nine men, to make it two points and five goals from eight Premier League matches - their worst ever start to a season.</p> <p>\"For a club of this size to be in the position we were in when we weren't scoring goals and there were clearly some issues in the dressing room between the manager and some of the players,\" Levy said, \"we could not allow the situation to go on for long.</p> <p>\"Some of the players weren't performing as well as you'd expect. Certain players were perhaps being more publicly vocal than you'd expect. The fact we were getting all those red cards and weren't scoring, losing games ... all those things were having an impact.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Woodgate had said that the team were worse than the relegated Leeds side he had played in and David Bentley had claimed the players did not know \"where people were running, what people were doing\". </p> <p>\"I just think it reached a point where I had to do something drastic and unexpected because we have a group of very talented players,\" said Levy, who has since seen Spurs defeat Bolton and draw at Arsenal. \"All of a sudden we are scoring goals. I can't believe it's the same set of players. We don't know whether Juande would have been able to turn it around. I couldn't afford to take that risk.\"</p> <p>He announced plans for a 60,000-seat stadium yesterday, on and around the Wingate trading estate to the north of the current site, and he has turned down an offer for the club from a private-equity company. \"It wasn't something we considered was a fair price,\" he said. </p> <p>Levy, who has committed \u00a344m to buying up land for the development, estimates that planning will take 12-24 months and construction three years. Naming rights will be essential for the funding. </p> <p>Les Ferdinand, the former Spurs striker, said last night he would welcome the chance to join Redknapp's coaching staff.</p>",
  "<p>The Stanford Super Series has come under fire from the England players, with their representative, Sean Morris, calling the multi-million dollar tournament \"a garden party\". Morris, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers' Association, is in Antigua for tomorrow's $20m (\u00a312.2m) shoot-out between an England XI and the Stanford Superstars, a camouflaged West Indies team, and had been expected to talk to the players about prospective participation in the Indian Premier League.</p> <p>Instead a meeting with players on Wednesday evening brought to the fore concerns about the manner in which the tournament is being conducted, with issues ranging from the on-field conditions, where the quality of the pitch, outfield and floodlights has been heavily questioned, as well as other worries, particularly the high-profile manner in which the tournament's sponsor, Sir Allen Stanford, has taken to entering the dressing room, regarded as a no-go area.</p> <p>\"We met last night with the majority of players,\" said Morris yesterday while the team were at practice, \"and there is a feeling that they are pretty uncomfortable with a number of things.\" The pitch, which has proved slow and unreliable, resulting in low-scoring matches, and the lights, which have given problems for catchers, have been strongly criticised as unsuitable for such a high-profile encounter. \"It all gives you a feeling that you are turning up for a bit of a garden party,\" said Morris, \"which shouldn't be the case with England cricket. They are turning up for a tough game of international cricket and it doesn't feel that way.</p> <p>\"Instead there is a sense that the game has been devalued in terms of a contest because there is a little more luck involved on those sort of pitches. And that, mirrored with a couple of things off the field, created a feeling that it is not entirely the most professional event they have attended. Once you come to play for that sort of money you accept there are some strings attached. But whether it is the playing surface or the behaviour round the dressing rooms, you expect a certain amount of professionalism when playing for England and I don't think it's been met entirely.\"</p> <p>Mike Soper, the man Giles Clarke beat to become chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board last year, added to the mood of disenchantment with a swipe at the man who cut the deal with Stanford. \"I don't know Giles Carke particularly well but I have not been impressed by what I have seen,\" he said. \"We don't want some loose cannon flying round the world shooting from the hip. It's a titular role, about flesh-pressing. The tail shouldn't be wagging the dog.\"</p> <p>Clarke comes up for re-election in March. Soper added: \"It's unlikely I would stand next year. I'm looking forward to the presidency of Surrey. But if he stays in power I may put up against him again.\"</p> <p>Morris is merely offering the views of those he represents. But there is a real danger as the week has gone on, of things being taken out of proportion. The much maligned pitches have not been conducive to Twenty20 but, given that the island was awash from torrential rain barely a week ago, it has been a diligent effort by groundstaff to get a surface of any suitability. So too the incident involving some of the players' partners, who were depicted on television being flirted with by Stanford, something that upset the players concerned. Stanford has apologised and even the manner in which he had taken to marching unannounced into the dressing room possibly has its roots in cultural differences rather than just the ego of a man who owns the whole show. In major American sports the locker room, far from being sacrosanct, is often an open area for media. \"There was an issue with the dressing room,\" said a spokesman for Stanford. \"Sir Allen understands the sensitivities of the England players and will not encroach on the area again.\"</p> <p>The ECB has said that it would review the Super Series and the $100m agreement with the Texan billionaire. Accusations that the game is not being run professionally are harsh, though, on an event that has been an extremely slick operation that puts to shame much of cricket staging elsewhere. \"They accept it is not perfect but have a chance of winning a million bucks,\" said Morris. \"I think they are prepared to get through it.\" Meanwhile Ryan Sidebottom's injured calf looks to have eliminated him from tomorrow's team.</p>",
  "<p>A point regularly made by people who think that the kerfuffle about Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross has been grossly overblown is that only older people are feeling outraged. The young, they say, can't imagine what all the fuss is about, because for them the essence of comedy is to shock and insult.</p> <p>Call me old-fashioned, but I would argue that this very fact, if true, justifies the vast media coverage of the affair. For one of its most alarming aspects has been the claim that young people find what happened on Brand's Radio 2 show perfectly acceptable. How could anyone find it acceptable that obscene telephone calls made to a harmless old man should be broadcast against his will to millions of radio listeners?</p> <p>I don't, as a matter of fact, believe that young people are generally of that view, whether or not they have heard of Andrew Sachs or are aware that - for his role as Manuel in Fawlty Towers - he has earned the status of a national treasure (and is therefore someone you insult at your peril). Not all young people are so stupid as to find all vulgar abuse amusing, even when it's completely humourless and directed at someone they've never heard of.</p> <p>But it has been implicit in the comments of some media insiders that the BBC needs to cater separately for two different audiences - the elderly, who like cosy, inoffensive entertainment, and the young, who are bored by anything that is not \"cutting-edge\" or \"pushing the boundaries\". In other words, the corporation should cater to the perceived nastiness of the young, provided broadcasters do not \"cross the line\", whatever that may be.</p> <p>For most people, the \"line\" in comedy is between what is funny and what is not. Well-directed mockery or satire amuses everyone, young or old, even when it is sharp. But the BBC's \"line\" would seem to be the one at which popular outrage outweighs the shock value of what is broadcast, irrespective of whether or not it is funny.</p> <p>That is borne out by the fact that the BBC failed to react seriously to the Brand-Ross affair until the number of complaints from the public had swollen from an initial handful to 27,000 after the press had taken up the cudgels. It gives the impression that its \"standards\" are determined by the size of the fuss a controversial broadcast provokes, rather than by any independent judgment of its own. And many at the BBC seem to want to blame the press in this instance for there being any fuss at all.</p> <p>If good is to come out of this business, it will be an end to the culture of rudeness and cruelty that permeates much of BBC comedy. That shouldn't be seen as blandness or cowardice on the corporation's part, but as a return to civilised standards and to an understanding of what constitutes humour. It would be no more than a rejection of loutishness. When there is great public concern about what David Cameron has called \"the angry harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us\", it is most strange that the BBC, of all institutions, should see it as its duty to nourish it.</p> <p>\u2022 I enjoyed the first of John Prescott's television series onclass, The Class System and Me, mainly because of its revelation of his wife Pauline as a woman of great charm, humour and good sense, but it told me almost nothing about class. If there is still a class system operating in Britain, as I assume there must be, the programme failed to identify where or how.</p> <p>As is normal with programmes of this kind, it consisted of a series of contrived confrontations in which Prescott, the working-class hero, was brought into contact with supposed toffs or, in the case of three teenage \"chav\" girls in Lewisham in south-east London, with people he might regard as belonging to a lower caste than himself. Such scenes are produced for their entertainment potential and seldom offer much enlightenment, as was the case here. Michael, the seventh Earl of Onslow, is an hereditary peer and therefore, by definition, \"upper class\", but privilege has not raised him to anything like the heights in politics that Prescott has scaled, and he is not even the owner of Clandon Park, the great country house in Surrey at which he entertained the Prescotts. It belongs to the National Trust. The Hay-on-Wye literary festival, where Prescott was brought face to face with purportedly \"middle-class\" intellectuals, is attended by a mostly elderly, bookish crowd who are probably much poorer than him and would not appear to deserve the guillotine. The young men at the Henley Regatta whom he also met were of equally uncertain social origin.</p> <p>No, the programme was about an idea that exists in Prescott's head that he has somehow, despite his impressive political ascent, been held back or kept down because of his background as a waiter on an ocean liner. And his class resentment seems to be mainly directed at Tony and Cherie Blair, who would never invite him and Pauline to state banquets. This is a series not about class at all, but about Prescott's own peculiar view of the world. There is still room for a programme that would try to explain what class actually means today, if indeed it means anything at all.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Alexander has much enjoyed <strong>The White War by Mark Thompson</strong>: \"A brilliantly researched account of the fighting between Italy and Austria in the first world war, a futile, brutal campaign.\" He attended a glittering reception at Apsley House to launch <strong>Jane Wellesley</strong>'s long-awaited book, <strong>Wellington: A Journey Through My Family</strong>, \"which starts most promisingly\".</p>",
  "<p>In the final days of the election many Republicans seem to have given up the fight for power. But don't be fooled: that doesn't mean they are relaxing. If you want to see real Republican elbow grease, check out the energy going into chucking great chunks of the $700bn bail-out out the door. At a recent Senate banking committee hearing, the Republican Bob Corker was fixated on this task, and with a clear deadline in mind: inauguration. \"How much of it do you think may be actually spent by January 20 or so?\" Corker asked Neel Kashkari, the 35-year-old former banker in charge of the bail-out.</p> <p>When European colonialists realised that they had no choice but to hand over power to the indigenous citizens, they would often turn their attention to stripping the local treasury of its gold and grabbing valuable livestock. If they were really nasty, like the Portuguese in Mozambique in the mid-1970s, they poured concrete down the elevator shafts.</p> <p>Nothing so barbaric for the Bush gang. Rather than open plunder, it prefers bureaucratic instruments, such as \"distressed asset\" auctions and the \"equity purchase program\". But make no mistake: the goal is the same as it was for the defeated Portuguese - a final, frantic looting of the public wealth before they hand over the keys to the safe.</p> <p>How else to make sense of the bizarre decisions that have governed the allocation of the bail-out money? When the Bush administration announced it would be injecting $250bn into US banks in exchange for equity, the plan was widely referred to as \"partial nationalisation\" - a radical measure required to get banks lending again. Henry Paulson, the treasury secretary, had seen the light, we were told, and was following the lead of Gordon Brown.</p> <p>In fact, there has been no nationalisation, partial or otherwise. American taxpayers have gained no meaningful control over the banks, which is why the banks are free to spend the new money as they wish. At Morgan Stanley, it looks as if much of the windfall will cover this year's bonuses. Citigroup has been hinting it will use its $25bn buying other banks, while John Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, told analysts: \"At least for the next quarter, it's just going to be a cushion.\" The US government, meanwhile, is reduced to pleading with the banks that they at least spend a portion of the taxpayer windfall for loans - officially, the reason for the entire programme.</p> <p>What, then, is the real purpose of the bail-out? My fear is this rush of dealmaking is something much more ambitious than a one-off gift to big business: that the Bush version of \"partial nationalisation\" is rigged to turn the US treasury into a bottomless cash machine for the banks for years to come. Remember, the main concern among the big market players, particularly banks, is not the lack of credit but their battered share prices. Investors have lost confidence in the honesty of the big financial players, and with good reason.</p> <p>This is where the treasury's equity pays off big time. By purchasing stakes in these financial institutions, the treasury is sending a signal to the market that they are a safe bet. Why safe? Not because their level of risk has been accurately assessed at last. Not because they have renounced the kind of exotic instruments and outrageous leverage rates that created the crisis. But because the market will now be banking on the fact that the US government won't let these particular companies fail. If they get themselves into trouble, investors will now assume that the government will keep finding more cash to bail them out, since allowing them to go down would mean losing the initial equity investments, many of them in the billions. (Just look at the insurance giant AIG, which has already gone back to taxpayers for a top-up, and seems likely to ask for a third.)</p> <p>This tethering of the public interest to private companies is the real purpose of the bail-out plan: Paulson is handing all the companies admitted to the programme - a number potentially in the thousands - an implicit treasury department guarantee. To skittish investors looking for safe places to park their money, these equity deals will be even more comforting than a triple-A from Moody's rating agency.</p> <p>Insurance like that is priceless. But for the banks, the best part is that the government is paying them to accept its seal of approval. For taxpayers, on the other hand, this entire plan is extremely risky, and may well cost significantly more than Paulson's original idea of buying up $700bn in toxic debts. Now taxpayers aren't just on the hook for the debts but, arguably, for the fate of every corporation that sells them equity.</p> <p>Interestingly, mortgage fund giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both enjoyed this kind of unspoken guarantee before they were nationalised at the start of this crisis. For decades the market understood that, since these private players were enmeshed with the government, Uncle Sam could be counted on to always save the day. It was, as many have pointed out, the worst of all worlds. Not only were profits privatised while risks were socialised, but the implicit government backing created powerful incentives for reckless business practices.</p> <p>With the new equity purchase programme Paulson has taken the discredited Fannie and Freddie model and applied it to a huge swath of the private banking industry. Again, there is no reason to shy away from risky bets, especially since the treasury has made no such demands of the banks (apparently it doesn't want to \"micromanage\".)</p> <p>To further boost market confidence, the federal government has also unveiled unlimited public guarantees for many bank deposit accounts. Oh, and as if this were not enough, the treasury has been encouraging the banks to merge, ensuring that the only institutions left will be \"too big to fail\", thereby guaranteed a bail-out. In three ways, the market is being told loud and clear that Washington will not allow the financial institutions to bear the consequences of their behaviour. This may be Bush's most creative innovation: no-risk capitalism.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope. In answer to Senator Corker's question, the treasury is indeed having trouble dispersing the bail-out funds. So far it has requested about $350bn of the $700bn, but most of this hasn't yet made it out the door. Meanwhile, every day it becomes clearer that the bail-out was sold to the public on false pretences. Clearly, it was never really about getting loans flowing. It was always about doing what it is doing: turning the state into a giant insurance agency for Wall Street, a safety net for the people who need it least, subsidised by the people who will most need state protections in the economic storms ahead. </p> <p>This duplicity is a political opportunity. Whoever wins on November 4 will have enormous moral authority. It should be used to call for a freeze on the dispersal of bail-out funds, not after the inauguration but right away. All deals should be renegotiated, this time with the public getting the guarantees.</p> <p>It is risky, of course, to interrupt the bail-out process. Nothing could be riskier, however, than allowing the Bush gang their parting gift to big business - the gift that will keep on taking.</p> <p>\u2022 A version of this column first appeared in The Nation (www.thenation.com) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.naomiklein.org\">www.naomiklein.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles is a man of passionate convictions who expresses his views publicly, assiduously and provocatively. For instance, he believes he has a mission to save the world from GM crops, which he described in his recent Sir Albert Howard Memorial lecture as \"a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong\". He tells us that only organic crops are truly sustainable. He has also urged the government to promote alternative medicine and homeopathy in particular. In fact we must go Back to Nature, because he trusts Mother Earth to see to it \"that plants and animals are left to protect themselves against disease\". Science is clearly out of control, and he questions its contribution to modern medicine as well as agriculture.</p> <p>Such views are held by many, if not generally in such extreme form. His comments about GM crops have no basis: authoritative bodies including every national academy of science in the world, the World Health Organisation, the European commission and our own Food Standards Agency have found no evidence they cause harm. His views also conflict with present government policy that encourages new GM trials. As for organic farming, its basic principle, which Charles strongly endorses, is that natural chemicals are good and synthetic ones bad: a principle every scientist would describe as a scientific howler. Charles also believes that homeopathy could save costs in the NHS if used to treat asthma. This would be true only because more people would die.</p> <p>However, the merits of his views are not the issue. If Charles were a private citizen no one could question his freedom to say what he thinks. The snag is that he is the heir to the throne, yet seems unaware of the proper role of a constitutional monarch. The Queen sets an impeccable example. No one knows her views on GM crops or other controversial topics. She has given no hint what she thinks about any aspect of government policy. Nor do the constitutional monarchies in Europe stray into politics. They have all recognised, since the death of the doctrine of the divine right of kings, that hereditary monarchs have no right to interfere.</p> <p>Not so Charles. He feels he has a duty, almost a higher calling, to speak out - or, as he put it, to \"keep sticking my 60-year-old head above an increasingly dangerous parapet\". Even more inexcusably, he does not restrict himself to speeches. He has used his position to damage the careers of those he disapproves of, or, on a more charitable interpretation, has been blind to the effects the strong expression of his views are bound to have. </p> <p>Many years ago, he famously claimed that architects had done more damage to the City of London than the Luftwaffe and described the proposed extension of the National Gallery as \"a carbuncle\". Whatever the merits of his opinions about modern architecture, their expression by the heir to the throne severely damaged the practice of several architectural firms. Recently he jeopardised the career of Professor Edzard Ernst, the chair of complementary medicine at Exeter University, who has spent 15 years studying the effectiveness and safety of alternative treatments such as acupuncture and homeopathy. When Ernst criticised a report on alternative medicine commissioned by Charles, the prince's private secretary, as Ernst revealed in a recent letter to the British Medical Journal, complained to the university about an alleged breach of confidence. Ernst endured \"a gruelling 13 months of inquiry\" before he was cleared. </p> <p>The prince faces a clear choice. If he feels he must speak out, because the dangers to the planet posed by the excesses of modern science are so great that it is his moral duty to save us from impending doom, he should renounce his claim to the throne. If he wants to succeed as a constitutional monarch, he must shut up. He cannot have it both ways. A democratic country cannot tolerate a monarch who meddles in political matters and whose views only command notice not because of expertise, but because of a position that he owes solely to the accident of birth.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Taverne is a Liberal Democrat peer and author of The March of Unreason - Science, Democracy and the New Fundamentalism <br><a href=\"mailto:taverned@parliament.uk\">taverned@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Golf was never meant to be easy but, as the leading contenders for the 2008 European Tour Order of Merit staggered off the 18th green yesterday battered, beaten up and, in the case of this season's double-major winner Padraig Harrington, birdie-less, it was difficult to escape the conclusion that the game was never meant to be this hard.</p> <p>\"I played well,\" said an incredulous Harrington, who ended the day with a five-over-par 76. \"I was delighted to finish on 73,\" chimed the Order of Merit's current leader, Robert Karlsson, whose two-over effort left him eight shots adrift of the leader but did little damage to the Swede's prospects of lifting the Harry Vardon Trophy on Sunday evening. \"It was a grind,\" grimaced Lee Westwood. \"But then I like it when you have to grind.\"</p> <p>This was clear. The Englishman was the only member of the quartet of Order of Merit contenders to break par, shooting a one-under 70. That was good enough to tie for fifth, two shots behind Sergio Garcia in second but five behind the leader, Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen, whose six-under 65 was accurately described as \"incredible\" by Westwood.</p> <p>\"It seemed like every shot I hit came out the way I saw it before hitting the ball. You have got to take advantage of days when that happens and I did,\" explained Kjeldsen, whose shirt bears the name of Landsbanki, the Icelandic bank which recently collapsed. \"I'm playing well but I couldn't predict this happening. I watched a replay of last year, though, while I was changing into my golf shoes, so maybe that inspired me.\" </p> <p>The Dane has made almost \u00a34m in his career, so presumably he will not blink at the loss of the sponsorship money from his Icelandic benefactor. He would, however, be overjoyed if he could hold on to his lead all the way to Sunday evening, not least because he lost this tournament to Justin Rose in a three-way play-off last year that gave Rose the Order of Merit.</p> <p>Only six players in the field of 57 managed to break par on a day when the wind was both strong and unpredictable. Among those suffering was Rose who, playing on his own, was first to tee off in the morning and last in the field when the scores were counted at the end, shooting a nine-over 80.</p> <p>With more wind and accompanying rain forecast for the next three days it is easy to imagine there will be many more rounds of 80 or worse before the tournament ends. Equally, it is hard to imagine anyone taking much pleasure from such a spectacle - not the players and not the paying public.</p> <p>Valderrama occupies a vaunted place in the recent history of the European Tour because it has traditionally been the venue of the season's final event, though that is changing, as well as the setting for a famous victory over the United States in the 1997 Ryder Cup.</p> <p>The players are never less than respectful about the course but they are occasionally given to grumbling about its difficulty and unfairness.</p> <p>\"I hit a great tee shot on the 8th tee and still ended up behind trees,\" Westwood said pointedly. \"You have to be patient here and realise that the same kind of thing is happening to everybody else.\"</p> <p>Karlsson was another who found himself stymied, on the 11th hole, although he had only himself to blame after hitting his tee shot into the thorny undergrowth. \"I could see five balls in there but couldn't identify any of them as my own,\" he said. \"Fortunately the marshal volunteered to go in and find it for me.\"</p> <p>After a penalty drop and superb pitch to eight feet, the Swede escaped with a par. Referring to the marshal, he added: \"I'll buy him as many beers as he wants.\" </p> <p>Such are the breaks that currently fall to the man who seems destined to end the year as the leading leading money winner in Europe.</p>",
  "<p>Big investors are calling on top companies to put clauses in directors' contracts that would force them to pay back bonuses earned for profits that prove to be false. Bonuses earned on short-term performance have been the subject of hot debate in the financial crisis.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority is warning banks that it will force them to put more capital aside if their pay policies encourage traders to take too much risk. Investors are also taking steps to clamp down on pay. The Association of British Insurers has discussed introducing clawback clauses in directors' contracts with the European commission, which is working on new pay guidelines.</p> <p>The move comes three years after F&amp;C Asset Management hired a law firm to draw up a universal employment contract in an effort to prevent executives walking away with rewards for failure. The fund management group, which has led a campaign to curb such payoffs, devised a \"template\" for directors' contracts that would permit companies to claw back salary and bonus payments after executives left troubled companies. This work was sent to the ABI but did not gain universal acceptance.</p> <p>Clawbacks are more common in the US where a study published yesterday found that nearly two-thirds of top companies had such clauses in contracts. The US Treasury is demanding clawback clauses be inserted in the contracts of directors at banks participating in the bail-out.</p> <p>Peter Montagnon, director of investment affairs at the ABI, said the idea was gaining traction in Europe. \"There is support in the market for this. It would be desirable to have something in contracts with such a clause in them as part of best practice,\" Montagnon told Reuters.</p> <p>It is not clear how a clawback clause could be worded. But F&amp;C's analysis suggested a clause that cash could be recouped from executives if \"paid in error\" when remuneration committees did not know the full facts about a company's finances at the time of the bonus award.</p> <p>Bankers' pay is the subject of much scrutiny in Britain. The government has demanded that banks taking \u00a337bn of British taxpayers' funds consider executive bonuses closely. Executives at Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS are not receiving cash bonuses for 2007, while those at Lloyds TSB will take any payment they are entitled to in shares rather than cash. The government has not inserted any clawback requirement.</p> <p>The bank executives who are departing, notably RBS chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin and HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby, have taken steps to ensure they are not accused of taking \"rewards for failure\" by forgoing any contractual entitlements.</p>",
  "<p>'Whatever it might look like, we are really shy people,\" claims Xavier de Rosnay. As he sits beside Gaspard Aug\u00e9, his partner in the dance duo Justice, on a sofa in a small dressing room at the top of the London venue Koko, the statement seems reasonable. With Aug\u00e9 shattered after two days without sleep, it falls mainly to De Rosnay to discuss the pair's inspired music, a new documentary about their 2008 American tour, and the often bewildering collision of method and madness that underpins their work.</p> <p>Yet barely an hour ago, the premiere of A Cross the Universe, their new documentary, showed a rapt audience another side of Justice. By turns hilarious and shocking, it concentrates on the behind-the-scenes story of a tour on which the duo seem to have gradually lost their minds.</p> <p>There is a one-on-one basketball match in the aisles of a supermarket; there is Aug\u00e9's marriage, for which he wore a Def Leppard T-shirt and swigged liberally from a whisky bottle at a Las Vegas wedding chapel; there are food fights and pool parties with female fans. But underneath the sorts of capers two twentysomethings might be expected to get up to on the road in a foreign country lies a darker subtext. The band's tour bus driver, a laconic gospel singer called Roger Menees, provides linking narration; he gradually becomes the film's moral centre as the focus shifts from the light mood of the live shows to something more sinister, intense and problematic.</p> <p>The unravelling begins at the first gig, in New York, where their tour manager Bouchon (who goes by only one name) takes delivery of a package containing a handgun. By the tour's end, Aug\u00e9 has misplaced his new bride hours after their nuptials. (\"She tried to contact me,\" he says with a shrug, \"but obviously I didn't do the paperwork when I got back to France, so I'm legally just married in Nevada.\") In addition, band and crew have been frogmarched out of a Denver restaurant by armed police, and at the final gig, in Los Angeles, the duo are arrested after De Rosnay smashes a bottle over the head of a fan outside the venue.</p> <p>\"The first thing I want to mention is that what we show on the documentary is not all things we approve of,\" De Rosnay says. \"We don't say it's cool, or you have to do that, or even that we like it. Depending on your point of view, [the tour] escalated to things that are really fun and exciting, or really gloomy and depressing. But for us it was fun.\"</p> <p>The band have made their peace with Bouchon, whose obsession with firearms led to the Denver arrest; he was the one who bought Justice their own handguns. There has also been some kind of rapprochement with the fan Xavier bottled.</p> <p>\"He was like a psychotic stalker, really aggressive,\" De Rosnay explains. \"This was not the first time we had seen him, and he had been harassing us. Yes, there was blood, but he was fine - I think he had just two or three stitches, so it was no big deal. He had gone too far, but I think he realised this: he wrote to us and apologised.\" There is no mention of any reciprocal apology from the band, but the police accepted that De Rosnay was provoked, and he was not charged. \"I was really drunk,\" he says. \"This was really primitive self-defence.\"</p> <p>The incident itself is shocking enough, with the grainy handheld footage lending it increased immediacy, and the lack of context - the group's earlier encounters with the victim are not included - has the effect of making the attack look unprovoked. But the real surprise is that it is included in a film the band commissioned and helped edit. Most celebrities would pay a team of professional media handlers to keep things like that out of the papers: yet here are Justice choosing to show their fans their worst excesses, and even removing details that could help viewers understand why they did what they did. </p> <p>\"The film shows basically what happened,\" De Rosnay says. \"When we were editing the documentary, we were trying, as much as possible, to see these images as spectators. When you have a scene where, I don't know, Gaspard looks really good, or he's saying something really smart, but it's not that entertaining; and then you have another scene where we're just wasted and we have zits, but what we do at this moment is interesting, is entertaining, and fits into the narrative - then we're like, 'OK, even though this maybe won't be the best image we can give of ourselves, let's use this in the documentary so that we can make something that is entertaining.'\"</p> <p>Justice have delighted in creating intrigue and drama almost from the moment they met, at a party in Paris in 2003. After discovering a shared love of uncool soft rock - \"10cc is one of the most clever bands ever,\" De Rosnay gushes - the pair, whose background is in graphic design, began making their own music. Their big break came when they entered a remix competition run by the indie band Simian. They didn't win, but two years after its completion, and under the new title We Are Your Friends, the track was a Europe-wide hit. Remixes for MGMT and Franz Ferdinand followed.</p> <p>Signed by Pedro Winter, Daft Punk's manager, to his Ed Banger imprint, Justice spent a year working on their debut album, \u2020, which was released in 2007. Lumped in with a Parisian scene given the unwieldy moniker the New French Touch, the record found a niche somewhere between the glassy hedonism of the club scene and the aggressive muscularity of rock, its sound bridging the two worlds.</p> <p>Justice are not the first dance act to dip a toe into rock. A mutual appreciation society has grown up between them and Liam Howlett, who cites Aug\u00e9 and De Rosnay as a key influence on next year's Prodigy album. \"I couldn't ignore Justice on this record,\" the Prodigy producer admits. \"I just liked the fact that they had spun dance music around a bit, done something a bit different.\"</p> <p>\"It's kind of fun that he says that our album is a direction for him, because his album was a direction for us,\" says De Rosnay. \"Lots of people say the music we do, and the so-called new French scene, is mainly influenced by Daft Punk, which I think is untrue. Our album was influenced by the Prodigy's Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned, and the album by Jackson and his Computer Band, a French guy who makes music out of cut-ups. If you just blend those two albums, you have what is called the New French Touch.\"</p> <p>Howlett made Always Outnumbered ... on his laptop, using cheap software, after building an elaborate studio in his Essex mansion and failing to record anything worthwhile in it. Justice's working method for making music that will be heard on huge systems in clubs is similarly counterintuitive: the pair use a tiny iPod dock speaker as their reference monitor in the studio.</p> <p>\"Most people listen to music through these type of speakers,\" says De Rosnay. \"We noticed when we were DJing that tracks that sound amazing in clubs sound really flat and boring at home. We were trying to get the club impression on small systems.\" The music's imperfections are also critical. \"When we did D.A.N.C.E.,\" says Aug\u00e9 - referring to their insanely catchy Michael Jackson homage, which features lyrics sung by children - \"we had to write the score with some mistakes, because the kids were really trained singers. We had to make the clumsiness happen, because they were too good for what we wanted.\"</p> <p>The band's live show was designed to play well with both the rock and rave factions of their audience. Standing behind a bank of electronic equipment, twinkling with tiny red lights, De Rosnay and Aug\u00e9 are almost hidden; on either side of them are nine huge Marshall speakers. And in the centre, like a glowing heart, is a 4ft illuminated cross. There seem to be as many observers who conclude that Justice's use of Christian imagery is ironic as there are those who take it at face value. Leaving things open to such wildly differing interpretations carries risks as well as rewards, but they pair are reluctant to circumscribe their listeners' responses.</p> <p>\"We don't want to interfere with people's sensations by giving too much information,\" De Rosnay says. \"That can be disturbing if you misinterpret or misunderstand. That's also why we have our stage set up the way it is. We decided to hide a part of what we need to make music, because people don't need to see it, and it doesn't look good. Then we added some other stuff that is not generating music, but looks good. The only aim is to confuse people about what is working and what is not working. So at the end you think whatever you want to, you know?\"</p> <p>This, it seems, is the key to unlocking the Justice enigma: you're not supposed to try. \"I watched [a documentary about] the making of The Black Album by Jay-Z,\" De Rosnay adds, \"and there's a bit where he's with Rick Rubin, making 99 Problems. And I don't know if it's the way it's edited or what, but it really looks like they do it in five minutes. We'll never know, because we are not in the studio with them, but I want to believe that Rick Rubin has made the instrumental in five minutes, then Jay-Z just improvised something and you have a hit. Maybe it's all fake, but this is what I want to believe.\"</p> <p>\u2022 A Cross the Universe is released on DVD, with a live CD, by Ed Banger on November 24</p>",
  "<p>How Osama Bin Laden must laugh at the idea of a \"hunger strike\". Explaining the slo-mo business to him would be like putting an F-22 Raptor pilot at the controls of Louis Bl\u00e9riot's monoplane. History has lent a new perspective to the story of IRA man Bobby Sands and his 1981 hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze prison for political status, recreated here in Hunger, Steve McQueen's explicit, but icily brilliant and superbly acted film. It is a lacerating portrait of an agonised period of British and Irish history; I have watched it twice now, and each time have been unable to forget the famous \"Chuckle Brothers\" peace-process photo of a grinning Martin McGuinness next to a grinning Ian Paisley. Theirs, remarkably, was the rapprochement that the hunger strikes helped finally to bring about, by redefining terrorist prisoners as political bargaining chips, whose release can be quietly offered in part-exchange for a cessation of violence. The question of which side is the greater victor is difficult to answer.</p> <p>One of the duller things about discussing this film would be to trudge through the issue of whether it glamorises terrorists. It doesn't. McQueen's movie, starring Michael Fassbender as Sands, paints the hunger strike as tragic but quite without tragic grandeur. It shows how dysfunctional and despairing the whole remorseless process was: how the Irish republican movement, angry and frustrated, chose to put self-harm at the centre of its mythology. The spear of the 32-county nation stabbed itself, in displays of passive-aggressive victimhood whose function was to motivate a new generation of fighters who would be every bit as resentful as their forefathers. The movie shows Sands himself as an intelligent, motivated man, but one who long ago hardened heart and mind to the consequences of violence.</p> <p>Hunger offers a bold insight: that the hunger strikes grew logically out of the stomach-turning \"dirty protest\". Cell walls were smeared with excrement and urine to disgust, horrify and provoke the guards - a reaction the audience can't help but share - and this is where prisoners ate and slept and made decisions about the future of a united Ireland. McQueen gets across the nauseous reality of the dirty protest, and for a Republican leadership for whom loss of face was unthinkable, the protest kept alive a flame of rage and compelled an inexorable narrowing of strategic options.</p> <p>McQueen, screenwriter Enda Walsh and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt create a series of hard, spare scenes in which horrifyingly brutal action takes place: the compositions show how violence and hate and fear were inscribed into the very brickwork. As Sands, Fassbender gives another ferociously convincing performance and his emaciated appearance is, finally, almost unwatchable. He has a powerful scene opposite Liam Cunningham's tough but impotently disapproving priest, which plays out in one, austerely continuous shot of the two men facing each other in profile. Stuart Graham is excellent as the Maze prison guard whose private loneliness McQueen shows, and whose fate actually makes the IRA leadership look as vengeful as gangsters.</p> <p>Churchill talked about the \"dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone\", an image and a locality given new force by the uncomfortable fact - relegated here to a closing-credits footnote - that Sands was elected MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone while on hunger strike. Whether or not the director intended it as such, there is a terrible dreariness in what Hunger summons up: a kind of hell, drained of larger political meaning.</p> <p>McQueen is renowned as an artist and winner of the Turner prize, and this is his first feature film. I came to it sceptically, having been alienated by his video-art work Deadpan (1997), which seemed to me an uninteresting and frankly supercilious appropriation of Buster Keaton. But Hunger shows that McQueen is a real film-maker and his background in art has meant a fierce concentration on image, an unflinching attention to what things looked like, moment by moment. There is an avoidance of affect and a repudiation of the traditional liberal-lenient gestures of dialogue, dramatic consensus and narrative resolution. This is a powerful, provocative piece of work, which leaves a zero-degree burn on the retina.</p>",
  "<p>The problem is not simply an \"offensive\" incident, of getting \"caught up in the moment\", as Russell Brand puts it (Brand quits, Ross hangs on, as BBC tries to contain firestorm, October 30). The wider context, which may explain the gathering momentum of objections, is the prevalence of old-style men being overpaid (paid at all?) to delight in and celebrate their own heterosexual prowess and sexual innuendo, as if: (a) in itself it is of national interest; (b) that, like believing a good time cannot be had without getting drunk, you can't be funny without giving vent to old-style misogyny and lothario values; (c) that the pre-eminence given to all-male line-ups of men indulging in laddish bonding, joshing and self-congratulatory behaviour on TV is something we just have to accept as \"culture\" and/or \"entertainment\".</p> <p>These public egos-on-legs give men a bad name, at a time when many men have dared to leave all that crap behind, and to live and work alongside and with women as peers, rather than viewing us as sexual objects or conquests.

  "<p>The England and Wales Cricket Board believes it had no choice but to chase the controversial Stanford millions after its path to a shareholding in the lucrative Champions Twenty20 League was blocked.</p> <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India had offered the ECB, Australia and South Africa subordinate stakes in the tournament that begins in December but, says the ECB, applied particular conditions to English participation. They were that the ECB would be permitted to take up a shareholding only if it immediately banned the participation in English T20 competitions of those who had played in the unofficial Indian Cricket League.</p> <p>The ECB refused, fearing an avalanche of restraint-of-trade actions from the counties who had employed ICL players. Now, unlike Australia and South Africa, the ECB is not an equity partner in a competition that will make US$850m (\u00a3515m) over the next 10 years in broadcast revenues.</p> <p>Had the BCCI - which faces its own restraint-of-trade cases from the ICL itself - been more flexible on the stipulations over the 16.6% shareholding the ECB would have stood to make a fortune. Australia, which now has a 30% stake in the competition's operating company, will make $8m a year from the tournament in the first five years. South Africa will receive $5.33m from its 20% stake with India taking $13.33m.</p> <p>Under agreements with ESPN Star, the broadcaster, the owner-nations' profits will double after five years.

The FA chairman was not involved in the negotiations in the Caribbean that, according to the president of Jamaica's football federation [JFF], Captain Horace Burrell, led it to believe that the \u00a3135,000 debt might be written off as a contribution to a youth-training centre on the island. The FA insists the debt must be repaid in full, prompting a politically sensitive row. Burrell is an executive-committee member of the Caribbean, central and north American regional confederation, Concacaf, which controls three of the 24 votes that will decide the destination of the 2018 World Cup.

Payton's team emerged the 37-32 victors over the San Diego Chargers at Wembley on Sunday night but wonders if the intercontinental trip was worth all the hassle. \"Logistically, I think it's hard to bring two teams over there and play a game during the regular season like this. The travel, transportation, those aren't club issues, those are league issues. It's hard for me to say it's a great experience and a great thing for your club.\" The Premier League insists that English clubs are more used to international travel due to their Champions League and Uefa Cup commitments and that it would provide an \"acclimatisation\" period of one week either side of Game 39 fixtures.</p>",
  "<p>Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, yesterday defied recessionary gloom by reasserting that it would beat last year's record sales and profits this year. In an upbeat report, VW announced a 15% jump in operating profit in the first nine months of this year to \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.8bn). Net profit rose 28.5% to \u20ac3.7bn.</p> <p>But the world's third-largest car manufacturer (behind Toyota and General Motors) indicated that earnings had been squeezed in the third quarter, that the current quarter was proving difficult, and that 2009 would be \"very tough\".</p> <p>The group is at the centre of a storm over volatile trading in its shares, after Porsche, which wants to take it over, said it had amassed a controlling stake of 74.1% and was aiming for a \"domination agreement\", or 75% holding, next year.</p> <p>Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, VW's chief financial officer, threw a spanner in Porsche's works by suggesting that its plans could be derailed by a prolonged court battle.</p> <p>The European commission is poised to take Germany back to the European court of justice over its refusal to remove a 20% blocking minority vote enjoyed by Lower Saxony under a 1960 \"VW law\".</p> <p>The court banned this law just over a year ago, but Berlin's revised version retains the effective veto on significant decisions for the state.</p> <p>P\u00f6tsch refused to comment on VW's stance, saying that this was an issue for the firm's supervisory board, but added that VW had played no role in the recent frenzied trading, selling none of its \"put\" options.</p> <p>Yesterday's figures sent VW's stock up 13% in late-afternoon trading to \u20ac585, compared with an all-time high of \u20ac1,005 on Tuesday and a close of \u20ac517 on Wednesday.

  "<p>Mike Soper, the man Giles Clarke beat to become chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board last year, says he has been \"shocked\" and \"saddened\" by the Stanford Series in Antigua and may make a fresh challenge for the top job at Lord's.</p> <p>\"What has happened in the past few days has not only debased the game, it could kill it too. I'm frightened,\" said the former chairman of Surrey, who will become their president next year. \"It was obscene enough what went on in India. This is doing nothing whatsoever for the game as a whole, and even billionaires like Stanford can get into trouble in the current financial climate.</p> <p>\"When Kerry Packer came along 30 years ago the integrity of cricket was retained, but there will be no spirit of the game in Antigua on Saturday night. It will be a winners-take-all freak show.</p> <p>\"What is going on is demeaning and undermining the game. Kevin Pietersen and the players are obviously embarrassed to be out there. They just want to get the week out of the way. But I would take more notice of them if they all said they were going to give half their money to, say, the Chance to Shine project or youth cricket.\"</p> <p>Turning his fire on Clarke, he added: \"I was very disappointed to see the gentleman from the ECB running across Lord's to embrace Stanford and his millions last summer. I was appalled. It looked bizarre. I don't know Giles Clarke particularly well but I have not been impressed by what I have seen. We don't want some loose cannon flying round the world shooting from the hip. It's a titular role, about flesh-pressing. The tail shouldn't be wagging the dog.</p> <p>\"He is a businessman, and obviously a good one, but cricket is a great sport which can be almost spiritual in my view. It's certainly not something that can be measured only in pounds, shillings and pence.\"</p> <p>Clarke comes up for re-election in March and Soper added: \"It's unlikely I would stand next year. I'm looking forward to the presidency of Surrey. But if he stays in power I may put up against him again. One county chairman - and there are others who feel the same way - phoned me and said he hoped Clarke gets back in in March because then he can come a complete cropper instead of half a cropper.\"</p> <p>Clarke was on a plane to Antigua last night and could not be contacted.</p> <p>It is not only the Stanford Series but Twenty20 cricket in general which concerns Soper. \"It was always my view that Twenty20 cricket should never have gone international,\" he added. \"It should always have been a domestic, feeder competition to get people interested in the 40- and 50-over game and ultimately Test cricket. But now the search for instant money is not only debasing the game, it could destroy it as well. It can't last and I just hope the new game doesn't take Test cricket with it. It's ridiculous.</p> <p>\"What will happen next year if there is no sponsorship for the Twenty20 game? Who will fill the gaping hole? There should have been only one domestic Twenty20 tournament, yet in 2010 there will be two. Who's going to watch the game six times in four weeks? This year was the first without [spectator] growth and that could get worse. If people think the game will feed on its own success they are wrong.\"</p> <p>Soper, 62, was favourite to beat Clarke last year.

  "<p>A team of 5,000 volunteer lawyers representing the Democrats will fan out across polling stations in Florida next Tuesday to ensure the Republicans do not \"steal\" the election, as - Democrats claim - George Bush did eight years ago.</p> <p>Heading the biggest team of lawyers ever assembled is Charles Lichtman, a partner in the Fort Lauderdale law firm Berger Singerman, who has been working as an unpaid volunteer for up to 18 hours a day since August. His drive comes from the experience of being what he describes as \"the Hanging Chad Guy\", leading a group of lawyers based in the infamous Broward County for weeks during the recount in 2000.</p> <p>\"Legitimate votes of citizens did not get counted. If they had been counted, we would not have been in Iraq and the economy would not have tanked,\" Lichtman, 53, who is originally from Chicago, said. He vowed he would do his best to ensure it never happened again and began planning the operation that will be in place on November 4.</p> <p>Barack Obama's campaign team has recruited thousands of volunteer lawyers to attend polling stations in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, and other states where the vote could be close. </p> <p>But the biggest push is in Florida, in part because of its history and also because polls suggest the vote will be tight.</p> <p>The lawyers will be on hand to help any voters denied a ballot on spurious grounds, or fight to keep polling stations open late if they become overwhelmed by the expected high turnout. The Republicans will have their own lawyers across Florida too.</p> <p>So far, Lichtman said, there had been no serious problems, other than long queues - with waits of two hours or more - as people take advantage of the early voting that has been in place for the last two weeks. \"The only issue is the long lines but I think that is a good thing. It shows an enthusiasm for democracy. It is a great problem to have,\" Lichtman said. He was not anticipating any major legal challenges from the Republican side.</p> <p>An Obama campaign worker in Florida, who requested anonymity because he had signed a pledge not to speak to the press, agreed that Republicans had not so far been mounting challenges to voter eligibility at polling stations.</p> <p>But that, he said, was because the Republicans in Florida had adopted a different strategy, passing legislation that set stringent rules on voter registration. As a result, people were disqualified if there were minor discrepancies, for example between the name on a driving licence and on a registration form.</p> <p>The Obama campaign worker, who comes from outside the state, said: \"I have never seen such shameless manipulation of a process as I have seen here.\"</p> <p>Lichtman's equivalent on the Republican side is Ed Pozzuoli, another Fort Lauderdale-based lawyer. Pozzuoli, 46, who was also involved in the Broward recount, yesterday described Lichtman as an old friend, even though they are on different political sides.</p> <p>Pozzuoli, a partner at the Tripp Scott law firm who was the lead Florida lawyer for Bush in the 2000 recount, would not say how many lawyers the Republicans would have in place on Tuesday. \"We will have enough,\" he said.</p> <p>Also a volunteer, he expressed concern about the number of Democrat lawyers. \"Five thousand lawyers with nothing to do seems likely an ingredient for mischief,\" he said. \"I was there in 2000 and the more lawyers the Democrats had, the more mischief there was.\"</p> <p>The Republicans want everyone who is entitled to vote to be allowed to do so, he said. That meant the integrity of the process had to be protected.</p> <p>The legislation on registration did not apply to existing voters but only 300,000 new ones, and of those only a couple of thousand were at issue, including those with names like Mickey Mouse, Pozzuoli said. \"When you allow Mickey Mouse to vote, that diminishes everyone's right.\" </p> <p>Charlie Crist, the Republican governor of Florida, extended early voting hours this week by three hours a day, from 7am until 7pm.</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of households with wind turbines and solar panels being able to sell power back to the national grid has come a step closer after the government tabled an amendment to a bill that would allow people to generate enough power to serve a community of more than 1,000 people.</p> <p>The government said 10 days ago it was keen to get the proposal into the energy bill after facing down opposition from power companies concerned that allowing individuals and communities the chance to profit from energy creation significantly altered the market. The measure will be debated in the Lords next week. </p> <p>The amendment proposes that generators capable of creating up to 3 megawatts (MW) of power would qualify for feed-in tariffs (FITs), obliging energy companies to pay a premium to use the power, with the hope of a big increase in micro-generators from the 100,000 currently in use. </p> <p>A government spokeswoman said it was intended to encourage communities and businesses as well as individuals to install low-carbon electricity generators. The government said a 2MW generator could serve a community of 1,000 people.</p> <p>The government hopes the move will put pressure on the Conservatives' green pledges. The Conservatives' Quality of Life report suggested a feed-in tariff for the smaller capacity of 250 kilowatts. A government spokesman said: \"The Conservatives' idea would benefit individuals - ours would see people taking control of energy at a community level.\"</p> <p>The government is struggling to meet the EU target that 15% of UK energy should come from renewables by 2020 and will hope a big take-up of FITs will galvanise the effort. In his 2006 review, Sir Nicholas Stern said FITs represented the best way to make renewables work. Renewables currently account for less than 5% of UK electricity use, compared with 14% in Germany, which has legislated for FITs. </p> <p>The amendment is likely to be backed by parliament - before the government's action, a cross-party FIT amendment had been launched by Conservative peer Baroness Wilcox, Labour peer Lord Puttnam and Lib Dem peer Lord Redesdale. </p> <p>Tabling the amendment, climate change minister Ed Miliband said: \"This decision means that installing equipment like wind turbines, solar panels or biomass heaters will be much more financially attractive. It will make a real difference to families, communities and businesses that want to generate their own energy.\"</p> <p>Though green campaigners have lobbied for the move, they were \"deeply disappointed\" with the detail of the amendment, describing it as a \"fudge\". Friends of the Earth campaigner Ed Matthew said: \"This is not the feed-in tariff we were promised; it's a giant legal loophole. The legislation put forward by the government is vaguely worded and gives no certainty to business that a feed will be introduced.\"</p> <p>Tabling the amendment, the government also announced a financial support mechanism for renewable heat. The Renewable Heat Incentive - described as the first such initiative in Europe - will provide financial help for people who install renewable heat generators or heat pumps. Carbon dioxide from heating accounts for 47% of the UK's total emissions.</p>",
  "<p>Through a telescope in the boardroom of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/financialtimes\">Financial Times</a> you can look out over the City of London; beneath this morning's clear blue sky stand the Natwest Tower, the Thames Exchange building and the Gherkin. Boats scud along the river. A man strolls its banks. I count the cranes on the horizon - said to be an indicator of a city's prosperity - and spot more than 20. Despite the news of global financial meltdown, there is, a pervading sense of business as usual.</p> <p>This is a strange moment for economic correspondents; in the past weeks they have been thrust from relative obscurity on to front pages and prime-time television. Already the financial crisis has made stars of the BBC's Robert Peston and Newsnight's Paul Mason, but for many the collapse's true luminary is Gillian Tett, assistant editor at the Financial Times, and one of the few people who predicted the current state of economic catastrophe, some two years ago. She sits in the boardroom in a smart boxy jacket, Prada sunglasses pushed back into her hair, making light of the sudden burst of attention. \"I think,\" she laughs briskly, \"it's the one moment in history when CDOs and CDSs become sexy!\"</p> <p>Collateralised debt obligation and credit default swaps, Tett's specialist subjects, have long been the dowdy end of finance, so there is a lick of satisfaction to their sudden prominence. \"On the one hand, it's gratifying that people realise just how significant all this activity is,\" she says, \"on the other hand it's horrific what happened. I mean we were sitting there a few years ago trying to tell people, 'Listen, if you don't take note of what's going on, the way that finance has changed so fundamentally, there is going to be an accident.'\" She says it firmly, the way a teacher might scold you for running in the corridor.</p> <p>Tett began looking at the subject of credit five years ago. \"Everyone was looking at the City and talking about M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] and equity markets, and all the traditional high-glamour, high-status parts of the City. I got into this corner of the market because I passionately believed there was a revolution happening that had been almost entirely ignored. And I got really excited about trying to actually illustrate what was happening.\"</p> <p>Not that anyone particularly wanted to listen. \"You could see everyone's eyes glazing over ... But my team, not just me, we very much warned of the dangers. Though I don't think we expected the full scale of the disaster that's unfolded.\"</p> <p>There is something exceedingly calm and thorough about Tett. She talks with the patient enthusiasm of a Tomorrow's World presenter - a throwback, perhaps, to her days studying social anthropology, in which she has a PhD from Cambridge. \"I happen to think anthropology is a brilliant background for looking at finance,\" she reasons. \"Firstly, you're trained to look at how societies or cultures operate holistically, so you look at how all the bits move together. And most people in the City don't do that. They are so specialised, so busy, that they just look at their own little silos. And one of the reasons we got into the mess we are in is because they were all so busy looking at their own little bit that they totally failed to understand how it interacted with the rest of society.</p> <p>\"But the other thing is, if you come from an anthropology background, you also try and put finance in a cultural context. Bankers like to imagine that money and the profit motive is as universal as gravity. They think it's basically a given and they think it's completely apersonal. And it's not. What they do in finance is all about culture and interaction.\"</p> <p>Back in 2004, Tett asked a colleague to sketch her a map of the City to show how every part fitted together. \"Because one of the things I learned as an anthropologist is that to understand how a society works you need to not just look at the areas of what we call 'social noise' - ie what everyone likes to talk about, so the equity markets and M&amp;A and all the high-profile areas everyone can see. But you need to look at the social silences as well.\" When she looked at the map, she realised how much of the City was ignored.</p> <p>Tett's doom-mongering did not make her tremendously popular. Largely, her cautions were ignored, and when they weren't ignored they were subject to criticism. \"We had enormous kickback from the bankers in the City saying, 'Why are you being so critical of the industry? Why are you being so negative?' All that kind of stuff.\" On a trip to the economic forum Davos in 2007, she was even denounced from the stage. \"One of the most powerful people in the US government at the time stood up on the podium and waved my article, the article that predicted the problems at Northern Rock, as an example of scaremongering.\"</p> <p>But in 2007, people finally began to pay attention. \"I had been aware for two weeks that something very serious was building,\" she recalls. Tett was Japan correspondent for the FT during the country's financial collapse, and wrote a book about it, Saving the Sun. \"The behaviour and the psychological mood of the markets in late July was almost identical to what happened in the autumn of 1997 in Japan.\" The similarities worried her. \"I was busy cancelling holidays and things. But it came out of the blue for many people - investors, policymakers, bankers, our readers were suddenly completely at sea, at a loss to make sense of it.\" The financial system, she says, is \"so dysfunctional, so tribal, that people just don't communicate with each other\".</p> <p>At 41, Tett is too young to remember the financial crisis of 1974. She argues that this broad lack of understanding of what a recession looks like has been part of the problem for many in identifying the warning signs, though Britain's taste of economic downturn in the 90s has helped a little: \"At least we knew that could actually happen. America hadn't seen that at all.\"</p> <p>The strength of the City's PR machine has not helped either, she argues, nor has the secretive nature of that area of the financial industry, or the fact that many of the innovations made in the financial world in the last decade, while \"thoroughly sensible in principle\" had become \"completely perverted and taken to dreadful, nightmareish extremes. And that's partly because there was so little oversight.\"</p> <p>She assumes more than ever that the general public regard the City with \"fear and loathing\". Yet she suggests that our own attitudes to money need to be overhauled as much as the methods by which the City operates. \"People who come from a background of arts and humanities and social studies tend to think that money and the City is boring and somehow dirty,\" she says. \"But if you don't look at how money goes round the world you don't actually understand the world at all. When you try and join up the dots about how money can be linked to politics, can be linked to culture, then it's electrifying.\"</p> <p>She believes the nation needs to be educated in financial literacy, via community-based schemes in schools and through key community figures, such as midwives. In particular she hopes this might aid a greater economic understanding among women. One expects she feels this more keenly as a senior female financial journalist, and as the mother of two young girls (her husband, a former banker, now also works in financial education).</p> <p>\"Generally finance, maths, numbers, money, traditionally have not been seen as a female thing,\" she says. \"That's all about the culture of power. And one way that you keep women away from the power traditionally is that not only do they not own the money, control the money, but they don't understand the money. I feel very strongly about educating women about finance.\"</p> <p>It is of course our general bedazzlement in the face of the financial system that has made stars of Tett, Peston, Mason et al. \"It's a sign of how psychotic the financial climate is,\" she says. \"The British public is looking for answers, and Robert [Peston] is in the crossfire of that. He's visible and he's memorable and accessible, a character in a sea of dull bankers and bureaucrats.\" The financial crisis has made an unlikely star of Gordon Brown, too. Over in New York, says Tett, \"it's completely stunning, this Gordon Brown fanclub. He now walks on water.\" Does she approve of his handling of the crisis, or deem him guilty of mismanagement during his years as chancellor? \"Well,\" she says neatly, \"Gordon Brown, like every other western leader, was shockingly complacent and negligent in failing to understand what was driving the City. The British government was happy to enjoy the fruits of the boom, but it didn't ask the hard questions. That said, the American government has been worse, and, while for the last year the British government have looked like bumbling amateurs, against all the odds they've got their act together. The minute I saw the [bail-out] proposal on the table I did a double-take, because it seemed to me the first sensible response. It's not perfect, but ...\"</p> <p>Tett's move from social anthropology to financial journalism was not entirely planned. She was on work experience at the FT when the Soviet Union broke up. \"And they came around and said, 'Does anyone speak Russian?' I put my hand up, and I basically went from making the tea to writing pieces. Total Hollywood moment. Then the foreign editor comes round and says, 'There's going to be a revolution in Lithuania, does anyone want to go?' And I went, 'Yes! Me!\"</p> <p>She returned and joined the FT trainee programme. \"And they put me into the economics department.\" She pulls a face. \"Initially I thought, this is absolutely horrific!\" Her Damascene moment came one day when struggling to write about the foreign exchange market. \"I thought, you know what, this is just like being in Tajikistan. All I have to do is learn a new language. This is a bunch of people who have dressed up this activity with a whole bunch of rituals and cultural patterns, and if I can learn Tajik, I can jolly well learn how the FX market works!\"</p> <p>She spent a year in Tajikistan during her PhD. \"It's just next to Afghanistan and a very similar culture,\" she explains. \"I lived up in a very remote mountain village for a year, as a Tajik girl - wore Tajik clothes, spoke Tajik, looked after goats.\" So if things go totally wrong with the economy, she's got something to fall back on? \"Yeah,\" she laughs, \"I know how to milk a goat.</p> <p>\"It's a weird background to have,\" she continues. \"But it's helped me in covering the financial crisis. Having seen the Japanese financial crisis, I've always known that banks can fall apart. We never imagined that the Soviet Union would break up. And then in Tajikistan there was a horrific civil war. So that whole experience taught me that extraordinarily unexpected things can happen.\" She shrugs. \"To be really cynical, once you've lived through a really brutal civil war that's shattered your community and you're dealing with massacres and stuff, today's banking crisis is bad, but guess what ... it ain't that bad\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday November 1 2008.

  "<p>Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, has warned of a crisis of \"catastrophic proportions\" in eastern Congo. But to Pierre Kondoli, newly arrived on the outskirts of Goma with his wife and three children, and with no place to sleep it is one more turn in what seems an endless cycle of suffering. </p> <p>The Kondoli family walked for three days from Rutshuru this week to escape an assault on the town by the region's Tutsi rebel chief, Laurent Nkunda, in the stricken region's latest surge in fighting. </p> <p>Rutshuru was only home for the Kondolis for a few months, another stop in a perpetual search for safety in a region where conflict has claimed millions of lives - mostly through disease and malnutrition although mass murder and mass rape have also taken their toll - and continues to take hundreds more each day.</p> <p>The Kondolis are among more than 1 million people forced from their homes by conflict in eastern Congo over the past two years, some repeatedly.</p> <p>\"Sometimes these men would come and just want our food or money. I don't know who they were,\" said Kondoli, a 33-year-old banana grower.</p> <p>\"We stayed because we could grow more food. But then someone attacked last year and killed our neighbours and so we ran away to Rutshuru.</p> <p>\"We lived in Rutshuru for about a year after the Tutsis took our village. We think it was the Tutsis but there were so many men with guns around. They came to our village before and raped the women. Some of the women ran away after that but we stayed. Now we have run away again.\" </p> <p>Kondoli was pushing a makeshift wooden cart with the family's bedding and pots and pans, but it looked as if it was about to fall apart.</p> <p>His wife, Riziki, carried their youngest child, just a few months old, the entire way. She lifts the wrap she had tied around her to reveal the drawn face of a girl who looks as exhausted as her mother. The two other children, aged five and three, stare silently.</p> <p>But even after arriving on the outskirts of Goma, what they hope will be their new refuge, they are not safe. </p> <p>Congolese soldiers have given up defending the road to the town and fled en masse into the town, where some drank, shot wildly, looted homes and shops. Others raped. </p> <p>A UN-backed radio station said nine people were killed on Wednesday, including shopkeepers who were shot by soldiers who wanted to strip the stores. The disorder was contained but Goma's residents fear worse will come as military order collapses further. </p> <p>Still, afraid as they are of their own army, people in the town are terrified of Nkunda's forces. Like most rebel groups in the region it has a bloody reputation particularly after Nkunda's troops rampaged through another town, Bukavu, at the bottom of Lake Kivu in 2005. The renegade fighters went house to house looting and raping. Among the victims were teenagers and girls as young as three.</p> <p>With the government forces abandoning their positions, the road to Goma is open to the rebels. </p> <p>Nkunda taunted the UN yesterday by saying he could push past its peacekeepers and enter the town any time he chooses. He may be right. The largely Indian UN contingent has failed to stop the rebel advance so far despite sending in helicopter gunships to back the government's army. </p> <p>But for now Nkunda says he will hold off from moving on the town. Meanwhile, refugees continue to struggle south toward Goma, away from the sporadic fighting.</p> <p>The UN says more than 55,000 have already arrived, many from a refugee camp north of the town.</p> <p>The few with vehicles have sometimes had them commandeered at gunpoint by retreating, and often drunk, government troops.</p> <p>The rest trudge slowly with their bedding and a few belongings on their head and children dragged along or strapped to their backs. </p> <p>Most are desperate for some rest but even more desperate not to be caught in another advance by Nkunda. But for some it is too much, they simply cannot go on. </p> <p>Esparance Kasindi is barely able to hold her body upright as she slumps on the coarse volcanic rock against the bundle that is all she has been able to carry from her home. The 29-year-old mother has two children, boys aged eight and nine. She says she has stopped because her sons can go no further but she looks in no better condition than them.</p> <p>\"How much further to Goma?\" she asks. \"How long to walk?\"</p> <p>She has been on the road since Monday, fleeing a village as word spread that Nkunda's troops were coming. She said she begged the fleeing government soldiers for a ride, for food, for water. </p> <p>\"They did not even look at me. They are strong men. They could walk but they ride while my children walk. This is the situation we have in this country.\"</p> <p>More than 1,000 people have already crossed into Rwanda, and thousands more have headed for Uganda.</p> <p>Nkunda went on the offensive two months ago after accusing the government of breaching one of a round of ceasefires since a peace agreement collapsed a year ago. </p> <p>That accord between eastern Congo's factions saw Nkunda and his 8,000 troops integrated into the national army. But he pulled out months later and began attacking government troops he accused of collaborating with Hutu forces that fled into Congo after carrying out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. </p> <p>Nkunda says he is fighting to protect the hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in eastern Congo still threatened by the Hutu rebels. But the government and UN call him a \"bandit\" and the primary cause of instability in the region. </p> <p>The Congolese army has been training troops and preparing them to combat Nkunda for months, but when the conflict flared again the government's troops fled in disarray in the face of an apparently more disciplined and dedicated force.</p> <p>Nkunda's army has seized swathes of territory in recent weeks, sending about 200,000 people fleeing from their homes. Hundreds of thousands more were driven from their homes earlier this year and late last.</p> <p>Nkunda told news agencies yesterday he is calling for a ceasefire and talks with the government aimed at resolving the conflict. His demands include the disarming of Hutu rebels and revision of a \u00a32.5bn deal that gives China access to the region's mineral wealth. </p> <p>But he continues to menace Goma even if it is not clear that he really needs or wants the town. He would then have to control a hostile population while keeping the army and UN at bay across other parts of eastern Congo. </p> <p>Nkunda may also come under pressure from his tacit backers in Rwanda, who deny Congolese accusations of sending troops to fight with the renegade general. Rwanda views Nkunda as useful in keeping Hutu rebels from its border but it would likely prove an international diplomatic embarrassment if the rebels were to take Goma, and kill and assault civilians. </p> <p>The UN security council has demanded an end to the fighting. Europe is talking about sending troops, led by France. The EU's aid chief, Louis Michel, met Congo's president, Joseph Kabila, to see what could be done. </p> <p>But there is generally only contempt for the UN in Congo and little expectation among the people fleeing their homes or Goma's residents that any of it will make very much difference.

  "<p>Robert Cochrane should have checked some of his facts before lambasting the Tory party for supporting a new north-south, high-speed rail line as an alternative to a third runway at Heathrow (Tories under fire over plans for 'unnecessary' high-speed rail route, October 24).</p> <p>You report him as saying that \"Britain had a different distribution of population and economic centres from that of countries such as France and Germany\". Hence, he claims, we don't need a high-speed line for journeys like London-Birmingham, 106 miles. In Germany, the new high-speed line from Cologne to Frankfurt airport is 100 miles long. In France, the TGV Atlantique makes its first stop at Le Mans, 113 miles from Paris. Lille, first stop on the busy line to London, is 140 miles from Paris - the same distance as London to Stoke on Trent.</p> <p>High-speed rail makes excellent commercial sense over these distances.</p> <p>Equally misleading is Cochrane's argument that high-speed trains only benefit rich people.

  "<p>Resting on his walking stick, Wolfahrt Vogt took a last look at the airport that saved his life. For millions of Germans, this monolithic limestone terminal with its cavernous check-in hall was just a city airport, a transit point in the busy endeavour of getting from A to B. But to Vogt and a dwindling band of the old guard, this was more than a traffic hub. It was a lifeline, a marooned city's link to the outside world.</p> <p>\"Without Tempelhof we would have starved,\" said Vogt, who was 15 when the Berlin airlift started in 1948. \"It was our saviour. We were surrounded by the Soviets; we were shot at from all sides.\"</p> <p>All of which makes the last call for flights from the airport a moving affair. As cameras clicked and the departures board flickered for the final time, Vogt held a homemade \"danke America\" sign above his felt hat. </p> <p>\"This is a sad moment. This place is part of our lives, a part of Berlin,\" said Helga Stock, recalling how, aged eight, she had stared in awe at the non-stop stream of aircraft descending on Tempelhof, crammed with the goods to sustain a stranded city. \"For us, Tempelhof is a place of hope.\"</p> <p>For the grand finale, two 1940s planes - an American Douglas DC-3 and a German Junkers Ju-52 - were due to take off before midnight, leaving nostalgic Berliners to dwell on the airport's role over eight decades of German history. With an airstrip dating from 1927, the vast building, once the world's largest airport, was designed by Hitler's architect Albert Speer, and was built by forced labourers between 1936 and 1941. At the end of the war it became the gateway for more than 2m tonnes of goods, turning it into a cold war icon.</p> <p>The architect Sir Norman Foster called Tempelhof \"the mother of all airports\", and it continued to play a vital role. When the Berlin Wall split the city, the air link became the safest way of travelling out of west Berlin, underlining its importance in the lives of many Berliners. \"I remember meeting my wife here after she came from western Germany in the 70s,\" said Paul Billstein standing outside the crowded Air Snack Bar. \"This airport may have negative Nazi connections but it is also linked to many positive personal memories.\"</p> <p>He was one of those who voted against closing Tempelhof in April, a vote that failed because of low turnout. During months of political crossfire, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the tabloid Bild have thrown their weight behind saving the airport.</p> <p>But Berlin city authorities pressed ahead with their plan. Officials point out that Tempelhof, one of Berlin's three air hubs, has low traffic and is surrounded by densely populated neighbourhoods. Its losses of more than \u20ac10m (\u00a37.9m) every year have proved too heavy a burden for a city in debt.</p> <p>Construction is under way on the new Berlin Brandenburg International airport, due to open in 2011 on the eastern outskirts of the city. </p> <p>Tempelhof's airfield is roughly the size of New York's Central Park. Development ideas mooted so far have ranged from an environmental housing complex to a expensive private clinic, but its future remains unclear.</p>",
  "<p>A bill to legalise assisted suicides in Scotland is to be introduced by one of the country's best-known MSPs after a woman with multiple sclerosis failed to get a court ruling to allow her husband to help her die.</p> <p>Margo MacDonald, the former SNP MP who now sits in the Scottish parliament as an independent, will release a consultation paper next month and then table a bill next Easter to make it legal for a doctor or close relative to help a terminally ill person to die.</p> <p>MacDonald has Parkinson's disease and this year made an emotional speech in the Scottish parliament, calling for the legal right to ask for help in taking her life if her condition became intolerable.</p> <p>She said yesterday it was essential to reform the law after a court ruled on Wednesday that only parliament could allow Debbie Purdy's husband to help her kill herself at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. \"I believe it is inhumane and ultimately futile for the law to deny this right to choose,\" she said.</p> <p>More than 100 mostly terminally ill Britons have used Dignitas to take their lives, an offence under English law, which also outlaws helping a suicide. </p> <p>Suicide is not illegal in Scotland, but the issue about assisting a suicide has not been tested.

  "<p>When he was approached to run the London Underground, Tim O'Toole was offered some encouragement by a former executive: \"Don't take a job like that unless you are prepared for a public and humiliating dismissal.\" </p> <p>The 53-year-old American took the role of managing director and, almost six years on, is undaunted by the pitfalls. </p> <p>He has just had an \"extraordinarily bad\" morning on the network but is bemused by suggestions that running one of the world's most complicated, ancient and busy bits of transport infrastructure is a hellish way to earn a living. \"I don't view this as a job or career. I feel like I have already done that. This has been the most wonderful experience. People say I must have the worst job in London. It's the best job in the world.\"</p> <p>At its peak, the tube carries more than 3 million people a day on 11 lines, sometimes using infrastructure dating back to 1863. O'Toole has to ensure that ageing equipment does not crumble under the pressure of ever-growing numbers of passengers, while overseeing a \u00a330bn improvement programme. He has compared it to performing a knee operation on someone who is playing tennis. </p> <p>Renowned for his devotion to being a public servant, O'Toole conducts a different kind of surgery when he gets the tube to work every morning, his London Underground name badge always on display. </p> <p>\"People tell me 'oh Christ the things you must get told'. You think passengers would really let you have it, but that has never happened to me. Everybody wants to tell you some bad experience but by the time they get to the end of the anecdote they say, 'You know it works most of the time.'\" </p> <p>But not all of the time. This interview takes place next to the London Underground operations centre, where staff are watching the network return to normal after equipment failures on the Jubilee and Victoria lines made tens of thousands of commuters late for work. </p> <p>\"In the old days this was a standard morning,\" says O'Toole, adding that these kinds of glitches have been reduced by about 40% compared with four years ago. </p> <p><strong>Cattle quip</strong></p> <p>According to transport experts, the modest Pittsburgh-born lawyer deserves much of the credit for the turnaround. Tony Travers, director of the Greater London group at the London School of Economics, has been a vociferous critic of past tube chiefs. He said: \"There is no doubt O'Toole is a class act, by common consent. He is often described as the best public servant in London and it would be hard to disagree.\" </p> <p>Stephen Glaister, a professor and former board member at Transport for London, the authority that oversees the London Underground, says: \"He has been a spectacular success. He has had to deal with an awful lot of very difficult situations.\"</p> <p>O'Toole's appointment baffled some Londoners at first. He was chief executive of a Philadelphia rail freight company, Consolidated Rail Corporation, and he had no experience of running a passenger railway. The man who appointed him, former London mayor Ken Livingstone, quipped that at least O'Toole had transported cattle in better conditions than most tube passengers were used to. It resonated with the public but embarrassed the newcomer, who apparently hates that anecdote but brushes it off with polite deference to his old boss: \"We did not transport cattle.\" And O'Toole is adamant that there are plenty of \"native\" executives who could do his job. However, he arrived as Livingstone was implementing, through gritted teeth, a \u00a330bn public-private partnership maintenance programme that proved as unpopular as it was fiendishly complex. </p> <p>Running the Underground called for someone with a good understanding of legal matters and arcane financial contracts. As a former general counsel and chief operating officer at Conrail, O'Toole had the right attributes. He also goes about his job with what Travers describes as an unflappable \"mannered charm\" and \"an underlying patience and competence\".</p> <p>The only doubt hanging over O'Toole is whether he will return to America sooner than expected, taking his extensive knowledge of the network and the PPP programme with him. </p> <p>He admits that he won't stay in Britain indefinitely: \"Our home is there [in the US]. My wife prefers it there - not so much preferring the US over the UK, but preferring the countryside to the city.\" As for offers from the private sector, where he must feature on the radar of several firms, he is uninterested: \"It is not something I am out trawling for.\" </p> <p>Happier to talk about the tube than himself, O'Toole passes on the praise. He received an honorary CBE for London Underground's response to the July 7 attacks in 2005, which saw 12,000 staff restore the tube to working order within 24 hours of a series of bombings that claimed 52 victims. \"There are so many who deserve it, they give it to the guy at the top as a symbol for the others,\" he says. \"The one positive thing [about the attacks] was that people perceived the professionalism of the staff and it allowed the staff to remember how good they are.\" </p> <p>O'Toole believes the rapid turnaround helped downgrade the tube as a target by proving it could not be brought to a prolonged halt, though he thinks the threat will diminish in time: \"I don't think we're involved in some kind of war. This madness burns itself out. It has in the past and it will this time.\"</p> <p><strong>Exasperation</strong></p> <p>The PPP programme, which hands over maintenance and upgrading to the private sector, has been the dominant issue of O'Toole's tenure. With the new London mayor, Boris Johnson, he is asking for at least \u00a31.4bn in government cash to plug a funding gap: \"No we don't have enough money.\" </p> <p>The biggest PPP contractor, Metronet, was in effect nationalised by London Underground last year and the surviving contractor, Tube Lines, requires at least \u00a31.4bn more from O'Toole to complete vital work up to 2017. </p> <p>It is at this point in the interview that O'Toole slips into open exasperation. After all, he needs financial help from Gordon Brown, the architect of the PPP, to bail out a transport system controlled by a Tory mayor. The consequence of not paying out, he says, is a return to the bad old days: \"The tube will deteriorate at these usage rates. The more we look at the PPP, the more the craziness and the diabolical nature of the contract reveals itself.\" </p> <p>He warns that Crossrail, a \u00a316bn project for a train service through central London, should not detract from the tube. \"This is far more important than Crossrail. There is no comparison. Crossrail is great, it will be a very important construction project in this needy time, but it does not give to London what the tube does, which is to get you to work and get you home every night. If you can put together a political coalition to create Crossrail, surely you can get one together to sustain the tube.\"</p> <p>The stridency of his comments reflect a good relationship with his new boss - \"Boris is one smart guy\" - and also a bipartisan commitment to the 253 miles of track, 522 trains and 268 stations that constitute the network, as well as the people who travel on it. </p> <p>Referring to other parts of the economy that have received government cash recently, he adds: \"No bank is going to get you home at night, so where do you want to put that money?\" Over to you, Gordon.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 53</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> La Salle University, Philadelphia, BA English literature, maxima cum laude 1977; University of Pittsburgh School of Law 1980 </p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>1984-98</strong> Worked for Conrail, rising to senior vice-president</p> <p><strong>1998-2001</strong> President and chief executive officer, Conrail </p> <p><strong>2003-</strong> Managing director, London Underground </p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married to Patricia and has a son and a daughter</p> <p><strong>Interests </strong>Chelsea FC, golf, theatre, architecture and good industrial design, particularly the work of Frank Pick</p>",
  "<p>Boys born to mothers who drank lightly during pregnancy are better behaved and score more highly in tests at the age of three than the sons of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/women\">women</a> who abstained, according to a study published today.</p> <p>Researchers found there was no link between light drinking in pregnancy - defined as one to two units a week, or on occasion - and any behavioural or cognitive problems in children at the age of three.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the University College London study found that some of the children of light-drinking mothers appeared to be doing better than the babies of those who abstained.</p> <p>Boys born to mothers who drank lightly were 40% less likely to have conduct problems and 30% less likely to be hyperactive, even when the differences between social and economic circumstances were taken into account. They also scored more highly in vocabulary tests and were better able to identify shapes, colours, letters and numbers.</p> <p>The research has the authority of a large study - it involved 12,495 children - but is likely to further fuel the controversy over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">alcohol</a> in pregnancy.</p> <p>The study also found that girls born to light drinkers were 30% less likely to have emotional and peer problems, compared with abstainers, but in their case this could not be extricated from their family backgrounds.</p> <p>Although allowances had been made for social circumstances, Dr Yvonne Kelly, the lead researcher, said they could not be completely certain that the children's better performance was not linked to their family background. \"The reasons behind these findings might in part be because light drinkers tend to be more socially advantaged than abstainers, rather than being due to the physical benefits of low-level alcohol consumption seen, for example, in heart disease,\" said Kelly.</p> <p>\"However, it may also be that light-drinking mothers tend to be more relaxed themselves and this contributes to better behavioural and cognitive outcomes in their children.\"</p> <p>The study aimed to fill the substantial knowledge gap on the impact of women's drinking on their babies, which has led to conflicting and confusing advice from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">health</a> bodies and government.</p> <p>Although it has always been clear that heavy drinking can seriously damage babies, scientists have not had good evidence either to prove or disprove that light drinking does any harm. Doctors and other health experts have swung uneasily between condoning a drink or two each week and urging women to abstain.</p> <p>Led by the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, the Department of Health has of late said that no alcohol is the best policy. However, the official guidance issued this year by the standard-setting National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) is that it is best not to drink at all for the first three months on the grounds of a risk of miscarriage, but that thereafter women who choose to take the occasional drink will not harm the foetus.</p> <p><strong>Confusing</strong></p> <p>The UCL researchers say there is inconsistency in public policy on light drinking in pregnancy which is confusing for health professionals as well as the public. A recent review by the national perinatal epidemiology unit and a statement from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists both called for population-based studies - which is what the UCL research is - to try to settle the question.</p> <p>\"There is inconsistency in policy around this issue and studies such as this one are vital in light of the wider debate around drinking and pregnancy,\" said Kelly. \"Our study's findings do raise questions as to whether the current push for policy to recommend complete abstinence during pregnancy is merited and suggest that further research needs to be done.\"</p> <p>Just because three-year-old children appear to be unharmed by their mothers' light drinking, that does not necessarily rule out any damage later on, she said. UCL is now assessing the impact on the same children at the age of five. It will also look at whether it made any difference whether the woman drank early or late in pregnancy.</p> <p>The Department of Health reiterated its position that pregnant women should not drink. \"Pregnant women or women trying to conceive should avoid drinking alcohol,\" said Donaldson. \"This advice is further strengthened by Nice's latest guidance that highlights this is most important at the beginning of pregnancy, when there may be an increased risk of miscarriage, and again reinforces that if they do choose to drink, to protect the baby, they should not drink more than one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week and should not get drunk.\"</p> <h2>Foetal detraction</h2> <p>Pregnancy may be a normal state, but the list of food, drinks and activities to avoid gets longer. The Department of Health warns against:</p> <p>Soft and blue-veined cheese, such as Camembert, Brie and Stilton, pate, potato salad and coleslaw, ready meals and reheated food, in case they are contaminated with listeria, a bacterium which can cause miscarriage.</p> <p>Runny eggs and mayonnaise and undercooked meat, in case of salmonella.</p> <p>Unwashed raw fruit and vegetables, unpasteurised goat's milk and goat's cheese, which may be contaminated with the toxoplasmosis parasite.</p> <p>High-dose vitamin A.</p> <p>More than two portions a week of oily fish, which may contain dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. </p> <p>Shark, swordfish and marlin, which contain high levels of mercury.</p> <p>More than 300mg of caffeine from coffee, tea, cola or chocolate, which limits the body's absorption of iron.</p> <p>Mountaineering and hot-air ballooning, because changes in oxygen levels can trigger premature labour.</p> <p><strong>Confused?

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a> attempted last night to draw the poison from another calamitous week by taking the unprecedented step of banning its highest paid star for three months, and accepting the resignation of one of its most senior and best-loved executives. </p> <p>The corporation suspended <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a> for 12 weeks without pay, calling his behaviour \"utterly unacceptable\", a move which effectively fines him \u00a31.3m.</p> <p>Mark Thompson, the director general, hopes the sanction will end the crisis, but some inside the BBC were lamenting the fact it was Radio 2's controller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/lesleydouglas\">Lesley Douglas</a> who was forced to carry the can for a lewd prank phone call by Ross and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a>, who quit on Wednesday.</p> <p>After a day which followed the script of other recent TV scandals, with camera crews swarming outside Thompson's Oxfordshire home and 24-hour news channels on standby outside the BBC Trust's headquarters in central London, there was a dramatic denouement. </p> <p>Thompson and Sir Michael Lyons, the BBC Trust's chairman, announced that Douglas had resigned and Ross was suspended from all radio and TV shows until January. </p> <p>The episode is the latest in a series of controversies to engulf the BBC over the past 18 months, including the scandal over misleadingly edited footage of the Queen, divisive internal rows over job cuts, and rigged charity phone-ins. After each, Thompson has promised new controls and to \"learn the lessons\", but some BBC insiders believe he is running out of road. </p> <p>The latest scandal was sparked by a Radio 2 show on October 18 in which Ross and Brand left a series of lewd messages on the answering machine of the actor Andrew Sachs, 78. The show subsequently led to 37,500 complaints to the BBC. </p> <p>\"There are some absolute limits and this programme went over those limits. No one is above the law,\" said Thompson, who said he had only known about the scandal for the last three days, a revelation that will lead to further questions about how his colleagues dealt with the crisis in his absence. </p> <p>Thompson, under pressure from inside and outside the BBC, gave the order to suspend Ross and Brand, before returning from his holiday in Sicily on Wednesday night after discussing the scale of the escalating crisis with Lyons. </p> <p>Ross, whose \u00a318m, three-year contract had become a lightning rod for critics of the BBC, was said to have accepted the sanction without complaint. </p> <p>\"I believe that he fully understands the seriousness of what has happened,\" said Thompson. \"I have made very clear to him the central importance of the clause in his contract about not bringing the BBC into disrepute. We agree that nothing like this must ever happen again and that tight discipline will be required for the future.\"</p> <p>In what may come to be seen as a watershed moment in the BBC's relationship with its top talent, the trust said there should also be additional controls in cases where the production company is owned or managed by the performer. </p> <p>In recent years, it has become common practice for big name stars, such as Ross, to agree deals allowing them to make their shows through their own production company. Others, such as Jeremy Clarkson, have signed complex deals with the BBC's commercial arm to benefit from worldwide exploitation of their programmes. </p> <p>The trust, after reviewing an interim report from management, said it was dismayed that the BBC had \"fallen way short of the public's overall expectations\". It also ordered Radio 2 to broadcast an on-air apology to listeners. </p> <p>The departure of Douglas recalled the exit of former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham last year following the row over a misleadingly edited clip of the Queen supposedly storming out of a photoshoot. BBC insiders are furious that none </p> <p>of the lessons of that affair appear to have been learned. The BBC was keen to point out that it was Douglas who made the decision to resign. Thompson said that while she was aware of the offending programme, she had not heard it before it was aired. \"Over the 23 years of my career at the BBC I have enjoyed a deep love and respect for both the audience and the BBC,\" she said in her resignation letter. \"The events of the last two weeks happened on my watch. I believe it is right I take responsibility for what has happened.\"</p> <p>The trust also said editorial controls in non-news programmes should be stronger, especially in \"high risk\" areas. </p> <p>Many within the BBC and the wider industry will lament the departure of Douglas, who shied away from speaking publicly but had a close relationship with staff and attracted a string of big-name presenters including Ross, Brand, Chris Evans, and Jeremy Vine to Radio 2. </p> <p>\"Lesley Douglas has made an enormous contribution to British radio and we have still seen no evidence that she was responsible for the failings that led to the show being broadcast,\" said Don Foster, the Liberal Democrats' media spokesman, last night.</p> <p>\"This resignation seems to have more to do with satisfying the media feeding frenzy than in working out what went wrong and ensuring it doesn't happen again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not surprisingly for a man whose band's stage show involves silly costumes and fake blood, Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips loves Halloween. Last weekend, he coaxed 1,000 fans to the band's home town of Oklahoma, to join in his second annual March of 1,000 Flaming Skeletons. Having each paid $35 to cover the cost of a skeleton outfit and a flaming torch, the fans became the focal point of the city's Halloween parade.

Billed as \"the world's first Excel music video\", the video literally plays within the spreadsheet programme, having been converted from film into numbers and letters. The idea behind the project is that corporate firewalls don't block Excel files, thus allowing old rockers with desk jobs to send the video around to their friends and colleagues.

  "<p>Tube passengers sitting near Jean Charles de Menezes yesterday told the inquest into his death that no warnings were shouted by armed police before they shot him seven times in the head.</p> <p>Speaking for the first time in public, the commuters described the moment officers boarded the train at Stockwell station, south London, on July 22 2005. Rachel Wilson, who was with her boyfriend, Ralph Livock, said at first she had thought the men were \"playing a game\" with a friend until she looked down and saw her hands spattered with blood.</p> <p>Livock said the couple had no idea whether the men on the train were police or terrorists.</p> <p>The couple's account, and those of other passengers, contradicted evidence given by firearms officers who told the hearing that they shouted \"armed police\" at De Menezes before opening fire. One officer said De Menezes moved towards him aggressively and he feared that he would detonate a bomb at any moment .</p> <p>Livock and Wilson recalled that the train stopped at Stockwell for longer than usual that morning. </p> <p>All of a sudden they heard somebody shouting \"he's here\" outside the train, before several casually dressed men armed with guns boarded their carriage. </p> <p>Livock said: \"One of my initial thoughts was it was all a game and they were a group of lads who were just having a laugh - a very bad taste laugh but just having a game on the tube, because they were just dressed in jeans and T-shirts, but with firearms.\" </p> <p>Nicholas Hilliard QC, counsel to the inquest, asked Livock: \"Had you heard anything said about police?\" </p> <p>He replied: \"No, certainly not. </p> <p>\"And I remember that specifically because one of the conversations that Rachel and I had afterwards was that we had no idea whether these were police, whether they were terrorists, whether they were somebody else. We just had no idea.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The thing that made me realise it wasn't a group of lads playing around or something else happening was when the first shot was fired.\" </p> <p>His girlfriend told the inquest the officers said nothing to identify themselves. </p> <p>Wilson said: \"First I thought they were messing around. Then I thought they were terrorists and it was only when I left the carriage and somebody moved me gently out of the way that I figured they must be good guys. Apart from that, I just didn't know who they were.\" </p> <p>One man levelled a pistol at De Menezes but said nothing to him, Livock told the inquest. The Brazilian did not appear frightened but looked as if he was \"waiting for somebody to tell him what was going on\", the commuter said. </p> <p>At this point two police marksmen shot De Menezes seven times in the head at point-blank range, having mistaken him for Hussain Osman, one of the failed suicide bombers of the day before. </p> <p>Another commuter, Wesley Merrill, recalled that several of the men with guns were wearing police caps, but he could not remember hearing any of them say anything to De Menezes. </p> <p>After the shooting Livock and Wilson fled from the carriage, boarding a Victoria line train towards central London. They got off at Pimlico, where they asked a station attendant to contact the police for them. The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>England's biggest programme to handle catastrophes from terrorist attacks to widespread flooding is in danger of going awry because of sloppy management and woeful financial management, Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warns today.</p> <p>The \u00a3330m programme, run by the Fire and Rescue Service, was set up two days after the 9/11 attack on New York's twin towers. It involved the ordering of hi-tech equipment such as powerful water pumps and decontamination suits, setting up a national control centre and specialist training for firefighters.</p> <p>A report published today by the National Audit Office says the programme has been hampered by delays, financial uncertainty, weak management and poor financial controls. \"Progress relied more on the enthusiasm, commitment and hard work of the project teams than coherent programme management,\" say the auditors.</p> <p>The programme has had a number of successes. New equipment helped firefighters to put out the huge oil fire at Buncefield, near Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, in 2005 more quickly and prevented an electricity power station from being flooded in last year's flooding in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>However, the report warns that if the 2007 flooding had happened simultaneously in the West Country and Yorkshire, 76 high-volume pumps would have been needed - 26 more than the number in England and Wales. The Fire and Rescue Service also wasted millions of pounds on consultants, many charging more than \u00a31,000 a day, against a budget of \u00a3500 a day.</p> <p>The auditors say that much more planning is needed to cope with future emergencies, with clearer lines of responsibility for commanders. Some regions still do not have emergency plans and other regions do have not enough capacity to handle emergencies.</p> <p>Leigh said: \"It [the programme] has been sloppily managed, with poor procurement, poor implementation and woeful financial management. All of this contributed to a delay of up to five years and significant cost increases.</p> <p>\"Most worryingly, there are question marks over the ability to deal with future emergencies because there is confusion about local commanders' responsibilities, emergency plans leave a lot to be desired, and the department don't even know where capability gaps remain.</p> <p>\"This project is too important to be allowed to go awry. The consequences of [it] failing could be unthinkable.\" </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the fire minister at the Department for Communities and Local Government, said: \"The NAO records that England's Fire and Rescue Service's capacity to respond to major emergencies has been much enhanced.\"</p>",
  "<p>Peter Rose could be forgiven for having delusions of grandeur. He is about to open in the title role of Boris Godunov at English National Opera - tsardom beckons - and in January will play the Pope in Palestrina in Munich. But, happily, Rose is the antithesis of the operatic prima donna, and, were it not for the fact he is currently being carried everywhere on a portable throne, would have his feet firmly on the ground.</p> <p>\"Gin and tonic please,\" he jokes, as he is carried past by four weary-looking attendants. Rose is a big man, and being an imperial throne-carrier is no picnic. But they manage not to drop him, and the only accident at the rehearsal I attend befalls a woman in the chorus, who is struck a resounding blow on the head when a wooden icon topples off a shelf. Let's hope this is not an omen.</p> <p>Otherwise, the portents for this new production are good: Tim Albery directs Mussorgsky's original seven-scene version, which has more narrative coherence than the longer version that emerged later; ENO's charismatic music director, Edward Gardner, is in the pit; and Rose is making his debut as Boris - a major role at last for a highly regarded bass who has built a strong reputation abroad while remaining strangely anonymous here. </p> <p>Does the anonymity bother him, I ask in the first of several brief breaks from the rigours of rehearsal. Does he envy someone like Bryn Terfel, with his starry profile and money-spinning record deals? \"I'm sure there is envy in the business,\" he says, \"but I'm not competitive, at least I hope not in that way. I don't look at other singers and think, 'I've got to be having that sort of career.' I'm very happy with what's going on. I sing in some fantastic houses. I sing at the Met and in Vienna and Paris. I'm going to be making my Scala debut [as Ochs in Rosenkavalier in 2011]. I've got some nice places to be singing, so I don't think I've got anything to be envious about, and I quite like the anonymity. I don't really want to be recognised. It's lovely when people appreciate what you do, but I value my privacy.\"</p> <p>Why has he tended to make his career abroad? \"It's often the way that one has to go away and prove oneself there before the people at home take you seriously,\" he says. \"Maybe it would have helped if I'd been called Rosovski or something more glamorous than boring, plain old Rose. But I'm now starting to do some big roles in this country that I've been doing abroad. Next year I'm doing Ochs at Covent Garden. I've sung there fairly regularly but in medium or supporting roles, and it's only now that they're starting to think about me for the major roles.\"</p> <p>Rose calls himself an \"accidental\" singer. He grew up in Kent in a not especially musical family, sang in choirs at school and gradually got the bug - learning piano, conducting the local church choir, and even trying his hand at composing. He studied music at the University of East Anglia and planned to teach, but he carried on with singing lessons and gradually realised he really could sing. </p> <p>\"Initially, I thought I'd teach and sing local choral society stuff - that was the height of my ambition,\" he says. \"I certainly didn't think I'd be an opera singer. I'd have been very happy doing the odd Messiah and Creation in village choral societies. But I could feel I was making progress - people would remark on it when I came home in the Christmas and Easter breaks - and I made such quick progress that I thought maybe I'm better than I thought I was. So in my second year at university, I thought, well, maybe I should give this singing lark a whirl.\"</p> <p>His family were doubtful at first. \"I remember my father saying, 'What do you mean, singing for a living?'\" recalls Rose. \"He was a policeman and thought I should be a lawyer or a doctor. He saw music as something to be enjoyed, not as a serious business. They've changed their mind now, but there was a resistance.\"</p> <p>Rose went on to study at the Guildhall, then the National Opera Studio, and at 24 made his debut in a Glyndebourne touring production of Don Giovanni in Hong Kong, as an absurdly precocious Commendatore. Then, as is usually the case with basses, it was a matter of watching, learning and waiting - for the voice to mature and the jowls to grow into the parts. \"You're just killing time, really,\" he says. \"A lot of young basses and baritones do a number of what one might call spear-holding parts and supporting roles, and I did my fair share of those.\"</p> <p>Now, at 47, Rose reckons it's his moment. \"I think that's a good age for basses,\" he says. \"My teacher, who died about five years ago in his 90s, used to say when I was in my 20s and 30s, 'Oh your voice won't even start to come into its own until you're in your 40s and 50s.' I wasn't sure whether I believed him or not, but I'm starting to feel that now I'm becoming a grown-up singer.\" Tenors may have all the fun and hit all the high notes, but their voices are usually shot by their mid-50s, when the jowly, growly basses are still in their prime.</p> <p>Rose hopes to get the chance to sing Boris elsewhere, though learning it in Russian will be a huge undertaking - he said it took him eight months to learn the part in English for his ENO debut. Meanwhile, he will be taking Ochs - his signature role - around the world, and will also make his debut as Falstaff in Seattle in 2010.</p> <p>One part he is unlikely to take on is Wotan, which he says lies a little too high for his voice, though he doesn't rule it out completely. \"There are always people who are willing to seduce one with those marvellous parts,\" he says, \"but I don't hanker after Wotan and I'm not sure it's me. Vocally I can probably do the Rheingold, but the other parts of the cycle are somewhat more stratospheric. I might be wrong, and maybe I'll come to a stage where I think actually I want to give that a try, and possibly Sachs [in Die Meistersinger], but at the moment, if we're talking Wagner, I'm happy doing Gurnemanz in Parsifal and Fasolt in the Ring and maybe Hunding.\"</p> <p>Rose now has the luxury of being, to some extent, in control of his career, picking the parts he wants to sing. \"I'm more selective about what I say yes to now. The fundamental thing at the beginning is, 'How am I going to pay my mortgage?' I'm not saying that's not the case now, but there's an element of, 'Well, I think I can probably say no to that, I'll have a break.' I have friends who have snow blindness when they open their diary, and if a job comes up they don't care what it is, they'll take it. It's that or opera Giro. Fortunately, I'm not in that position. I've got enough work over the next four or five years that, if I have a couple of gaps, I'm not frantic about it.\"</p> <p>The bell sounds and it is back to rehearsal. This large, jolly, easygoing man immediately has to get back into character as the guilt-ridden, mentally broken Boris, the tsar who won the throne by engineering the death of the tsarevich, Dmitry, and is haunted by bloodied images of the dead boy. Rose, on his dais, instantly assumes the robes - a shiny green dressing gown grabbed from a wardrobe - of impotent power. No ham acting and old-fashioned gestures here, but an attempt to internalise Boris's breakdown. Who needs Rosovski when you've got Rose? </p> <p>\u2022 Boris Godunov opens at the Coliseum, London, on November 10 </p> <h2>Mussorgsky's masterpiece</h2> <p><strong>The story behind Boris Godunov</strong></p> <p>Modest Mussorgsky's work list is as muddled and incoherent as his own life was. A litany of musical might-have beens strewn with works left unfinished or even barely begun. Largely self-taught as a composer, Mussorgsky was essentially an amateur, yet he became a pivotal and profoundly original figure in mid-19th-century Russian music, while his influence on Debussy, Ravel and even Stravinsky ensures his place among the major precursors of modernism.</p> <p>The core of Mussorgsky's achievement as a composer is to be found in his songs and operas, and in one opera above all. Boris Godunov, based like so many of the greatest Russian operas on a text by Pushkin, was his masterpiece. Yet despite its undisputed greatness, there is no such thing as a definitive version of this teeming, complex score, with its almost Shakespearean richness of character and incident, an unprecedented dramatic use of the chorus, speech-inflected vocal writing and rawboned orchestral textures.</p> <p>Mussorgsky himself completed and orchestrated two distinct versions of the work. His first attempt, composed in 1868 and 1869 consists of just seven scenes, but its political and musical radicalism were too much for the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, which rejected it out of hand. Mussorgsky immediately set about revising the work, adding extra scenes including an entirely new act, as well as toning down some of its more obvious antitsarist sentiments. That version was performed with great success (though still with one scene censored for political reasons) in St Petersburg in 1874.</p> <p>It was after Mussorgsky's death in 1881 at the age of just 42, that the problems began. In 1896 Rimsky-Korsakov reorchestrated and \"improved\" the score, believing that the original, crude and \u2014 as he saw it \u2014 uninspired scoring was part of the reason for the work's neglect, and this was the version in which Boris Godunov was presented around the world for the next 50 years. In 1940 Shostakovich, too, made his own orchestration, closer to the spirit of the original than Rimsky's. But it's only in the past quarter century that opera houses have started to go back to Mussorgsky's scores, sometimes making their own hybrids of the 1869 and 1874 versions. English National Opera is performing the original seven scenes that the Mariinsky rejected in 1869. It is Boris Godunov as Mussorgsky's unruly genius originally conceived it, warts and all.</p>",
  "<p>Radio 2's controller, Lesley Douglas, has shown a sense of responsibility and dignity rare among the BBC's management in resigning over the Ross-Brand affair. It breaks with a disgraceful BBC tradition of passing the buck as far down the line as possible. And it shows that she, perhaps alone among the senior managers at the corporation, is ready to recognise the acute difficulties junior editorial staff face when they are given notional responsibility for wilful on-air talent. </p> <p>It is not a new problem. Early in my broadcasting career I was assigned the job of producing a radio star. The editor told me confidentially that the great man was not at the top of his game. It was my task to radically improve the quality of what went out. </p> <p>As a young, earnest producer, I took it seriously. My duty was clear, and it was to the audience. On day one I suggested how we might rewrite a slightly misleading script, and the star shouted at me for my temerity. On day two I recut a package and the star ordered me out of the editing suite in a rage. On day three I asked him to add a question to an interview. He slammed down the talkback button and stormed off to see the editor. On day four I was moved and a more amenable producer was brought in. </p> <p>Too late I learned some essential lessons in management and tact. But the most important lesson was the power of the talent and the impotence of the producer. In theory I had editorial control and would certainly have been held to account if anything had been wrong. In practice he mattered and I didn't. He had the power while his producers were left with the responsibility. </p> <p>That wasn't a truth the management was willing to address, but it is the issue that underpins the Ross-Brand affair. Everyone wants to know why the offending items were not edited out of the show. The 25-year-old producer was publicly castigated for his failure to hold the line on taste and decency, and it was widely speculated he would lose his job. </p> <p>That is where Douglas stepped in. She let it be known that if her junior staff were to be sacked, she would rather resign. She had the grace to realise that frontline managers are the wrong targets. The real fault is a structural one for which senior management is responsible: a broadcasting culture in which editorial figures fear they'll get no backing higher up if they cross or challenge the super-talents they supposedly control. </p> <p>Ferocious competition in the new media market has exacerbated the power gulf between editorial and talent. Someone like Ross knows he's bigger than a programme, or even a channel. His salary makes that clear. How easy is it for a minion on \u00a325,000 or so, or an executive on \u00a380,000, to say no to him? </p> <p>The editorial teams who actually make decisions day to day are being landed with a nearly impossible task. They are urged to grab audiences, get out there, take the risks. Remote senior managers draw up general guidelines that don't cover the painful business of drawing lines every day. When Ross asked David Cameron if he'd had teenage sexual fantasies about Thatcher, there was no BBC censure. </p> <p>This problem goes much further than a single controller. It's something for which the director general and his executives should take responsibility. They are the people driving a ratings-based, competition-obsessed model, which has them signing stars like Ross and then expecting people lower down to deal with any fallout. To them, Douglas is another pawn. In such crises, the top managers go to ground, too scared to put themselves in the firing line. They evade the fact that their systems devolve all the risk and none of the reward to people at the bottom. It's monumental managerial cowardice, and it's where our outrage should be directed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jenni.russell@theguardian.com\">jenni.russell@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If the words humanitarian catastrophe and eastern Congo have a familiar ring to them, it is because the fundamental causes of a conflict that has claimed five million lives and continues to kill 45,000 a month through starvation and disease remain unaddressed. And this despite the world's largest peacekeeping force, with the strongest mandate - to use lethal force if necessary to protect civilian lives. The 17,000-strong UN force, known as Monuc, has patently failed to do this. In most villages the militias represent the only law, the only protection from rape, crop-raiding and kidnap. The international community's attempts to restore order have lost all credibility.</p> <p>The latest emergency comes with the advance of the rebel general Laurent Nkunda, who yesterday stopped his forces outside the eastern provincial capital, Goma, as government forces fled it. Nkunda claims the Congolese government has failed to protect his minority Tutsi tribe from the Rwandan Hutu militias, which escaped to the Congo after carrying out the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. He called for direct talks with the government and a revision of a $5bn deal which gives China access to the region's mineral riches in exchange for a railway and highway.</p> <p>Goma in particular and the Congo in general have been here many times before. North and South Kivu, the crucible of conflict over land, minerals and ethnicity, are littered with broken ceasefires - almost one a year since peace was established in most other provinces in 2003. Attempts have been made to integrate militias into a national army. Those too have failed. The four constants in all this are the national army's failure to disarm the Rwandan Hutu militias with which they are closely linked, the routine use of rape, pillage and murder of civilians by all sides (including the rebel forces of Nkunda), the involvement of Rwanda and Uganda in Congo's affairs, and the general grab for natural resources. </p> <p>There are rich pickings for the warriors. The tax levied by armed groups on charcoal alone amounts to $30m a year, and a UN investigation into the access, control and trade of coltan, diamonds, copper, cobalt and gold found that the exploitation of Congo's natural resources by foreign armies had been systematic. Nkunda says he is fighting to protect the hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in eastern Congo still threatened by the Hutu rebels. His forces are more disciplined than his adversaries. They took only the medicine they needed for their clinics as opposed to the widespread looting of the retreating Congolese army. But the longer this conflict continues, the more the rebel general's true motives come under scrutiny. It may be that he simply wants a larger slice of the mineral-rich cake.</p> <p>Above all, eastern Congo's continuing misery represents an appalling failure of international will. The UN security council has demanded an end to the fighting, but continues to see Nkunda alone as the primary source of instability. France is talking about sending troops and the EU's aid chief, Louis Michel, yesterday met the president, Joseph Kabila, to see what could be done. But there is contempt for the UN among the population in Goma and little expectation among those fleeing their homes yesterday that it will stop the displacement, the disease and the rape. </p> <p>The UN has the facts. A panel of experts has been investigating the government's armies' links with the Hutu militias and the extent to which Rwanda has backed Nkunda. They could use that evidence to pressurise the backers of both sides back to the negotiating table. The governments of both Rwanda and the Congo benefit from large amounts of foreign aid. That too could be used as leverage. What should not and cannot continue is the belittling spectacle of large numbers of UN peacekeepers unable or unwilling to do their job.</p>"
