  "<p>My father-in-law was born in Manchester. After the second world war he came to New Zealand and swore he would never go home. \"Not bloody going back there,\" he always said. From working class northern England to the North Island, and then \u2014 after he'd enticed my mother-in-law out from Manchester \u2014 they bought a car and drove north of Auckland, to what we call the Far North. </p> <p>They drove into unknown territory, she with her vague impractical fear of going anywhere, of all logistics, and he seemingly fearless, ready for any new experience. She held the map, unable to understand what it meant. On a whim, he turned off State Highway 10, on to the wild stretch of the Karikari peninsula. The peninsula road was only a dirt track back then. Here the land is dry and sandy, the sky a great blue bowl over the low hills, the scrub petering out into white sand beaches fringed with pohutukawa and shining flax. They ended up in a tiny settlement called Whatuwhiwhi. </p> <p>Arriving late, they came to the end of a spit of land. The little old car, in the twilight. The sun setting over the enormous bay, currents moving across the surface, the gannets diving into the water like bombs. I can hear the exchange. She: \"George, there's no more road.\" He: \"Well, I'm not bloody going back.\" A Maori couple emerged from a house. George asked if they could camp on the land. The Maori couple were the Rupaperas, Roma and Pawhau. Years later, Roma told me, \"George, he was so handsome. That blond hair . . .\" </p> <p>\"Camp as long as you like,\" the Rupaperas said, and a lifelong connection was formed. </p> <p>The Rupapera family still lives at Whatuwhiwhi, in a series of tiny wooden houses on this piece of beautiful coastline, at the edge of the vast, moving stretch of Doubtless Bay. They and my in-laws are still close friends, and this is where I go every year with my family, to stay in the bach (holiday house) my father-in-law built, on a hillside overlooking the bay. Across the water, in the far distance, you can see the curve of the opposite coast, and at night the line of lights at Mangonui. During the day, the sky changes and changes, every shade of blue, silver, grey. Stingrays glide along the shoreline, and sometimes dolphins cruise near the beaches. The children swim out to hear their strange whistles and watch them frolic (this despite a warning from a local researcher: be careful, far from curing your ills and all that new age stuff, dolphins play rough; they might just as easily pin you to the bottom and whistle jeeringly while you drown). </p> <p>Decades after his first trip to the place, when George died in Auckland, the Rupaperas came down in convoy and announced they were \"taking George home\". They gave him a tangi (Maori funeral) at the Whatuwhiwhi marae. He lay in state, wearing flax blankets. They buried him in their hilltop graveyard, in the Rupapera line. This was a great honour. As a rule, p\u00e3keh\u00e3 (white New Zealanders) are not given a place on that hill. </p> <p>The Karikari peninsula, on the western side of Doubtless Bay, reaches out into the Pacific Ocean. In 1769 James Cook sailed past the entrance to the area and noted briskly, \"doubtless a bay\". At the same time, the French ship of Jean Fran\u00e7ois Marie de Surville was anchored in the bay, and each ship was unaware of the other. The peninsula has about 70km of coastline, and lots of beaches, all beautiful and usually pretty empty. The road in has been tar sealed now, making it much more accessible, but it's still a wild, remote area, full of hidden bays and vast stretches of empty countryside, a place where barrenness turns suddenly into beauty. There is that particular literally ozone-less clarity of the New Zealand light. At night the stars are extraordinary; the children lie on the grass and count satellites moving busily through the points of light. There is strong colour, a sense of being close to and sometimes lashed by the elements: powerful sun, sudden brief rain, striking changes of the light. One day, crossing from one beach to another, I passed from burning sunshine into a premature afternoon, in which the sky was a deep, weird purple. The air became hot and seemed to pack oppressively down; there was rain, thunder, lightning, the full hysterics of a storm \u2014 and 20 minutes later, bright sunshine again. </p> <p>About 10 years ago an American (referred to hereabouts as \"The American\") arrived in the area and set about turning 3,000 acres of land around Whatuwhiwhi into vineyards. He built Carrington Farms, which includes the Karikari Estate vineyard, a golf course and a luxury lodge. This development hasn't diminished the wild feeling of the place, nor has it much affected the life of the inhabitants, beyond turning some of the local Maori into apprentice vintners. The Karikari Winery is built on a hill, with a view out to the white sands of Puheke. It serves lunch, and holds wine-tasting sessions. The locals can't afford any of this luxury, and most stick to Whatuwhiwhi itself, which has a petrol station and shop, and a backpackers' hostel called The Rusty Anchor, which offers horse riding, kayak and scuba hire, and so on. There is a cafe and a takeaway bar. The settlement has no motels, but there's a camping ground, Whatuwhiwhi Holiday Park, which has a few apartments for rent. And you can rent \"bach\" beach shacks. </p> <p>It's possible to hole up for weeks in George's old bach in January, only emerging off the peninsula to drive to Kaitaia, about half an hour away, for supplies. There are the local swimming beaches, Patea and Perehipe, and the rocks below the bach for fishing. Sometimes a Rupapera comes calling, bringing shellfish as a present; sometimes the man from next door gets off his boat with a big snapper for us, which his son delivers in a plastic bag. There is always the smell of cypress and gum trees. The scrubland gets tinder dry. One year the headland caught fire and had to be doused by helicopters with monsoon buckets; we watched, worrying, making plans to run down to the sea if the fire got too close. </p> <p>Some days we take trips, driving around the enormous rim of Doubtless Bay. On the opposite side from Whatuwhiwhi are Cable Bay (with a shop with a large plastic ice cream impaled in its roof like a crashed rocket), Coopers Beach, and then Mangonui, which was once a whaling and trading port, and is now a twee little town with a wharf, restaurants and shops, and the Mangonui Fish Shop, where you can sit looking over the harbour, listen to terrible country and western songs and eat fish and chips. </p> <p>At Patea beach, next to Whatuwhiwhi, I first encountered Roma and Pawhau's son, Bradley Rupapera. He emerged from the bush, where he'd been kipping under a tree. As boys, my husband and Bradley fished, hunted crabs and rode wild horses round the peninsula. Bradley spent a lot of time sleeping outdoors (large family, minimal dwellings). One summer we arrived at the beach to find a crowd. There were relatives staying, and Bradley had been allocated a mattress under a tree above the beach. He'd woken at dawn to see a beached marlin struggling in the shallows. He'd leapt out of bed, fought to catch it, and dragged it on to the sand. It was 6ft long. They were cutting it up. The old people were sitting in chairs; Roma, the matriarch, magnificent in her leopard-skin hat, was directing operations. The cousins had run off to get soy sauce. \"For sushi,\" they said. The sea provides a lot of local food. On the outgoing tide the kids climb down the bush track to the rocks below the bach to catch snapper. The locals use scuba gear to dive for scallops. </p> <p>Sometimes we drive along the road past Carrington Farms to Matai Bay. Matai Bay is actually two symmetrical, crescent-shaped bays side by side, divided by a thin spit of land. It takes a good half hour to walk to the end of one bay. One year we followed a school of dolphins around the crescent, another year we found an octopus in a rock pool. Here there are giant, smooth grey stones as big as cars, strewn about on the sand. The land belongs to local Maori. There are just a few houses, small and flimsy and mounted on makeshift blocks that look like wheels, as if the owners could let off their brakes and trundle them to a different spot. There is a camping ground at Matai Bay, but no other facilities beyond lavatories and bins. In the summer the pohutukawa trees are full of red flowers and the light shines hurtingly bright on the flax. The sea changes; sometimes there are waves enough for body surfing, at other times it's calm and still. In wet weather it's all silence and salty air, space and distance, the rain like metal curtains over the sea. </p> <p>Possibly the favourite trip is to Puheke Reserve. The unsealed road can be rough in summer before it's been graded, a juddering, sliding ride. It winds through scrubland and swamps, leading to Mt Puheke, and the long, white Puheke beach. After a serious scrub fire, a few years ago, Mt Puheke was black (it burned for a day and a night, blazing on the horizon, the flames like mad hair); now it is green again. </p> <p>Puheke is a surf beach, stretching about three miles along the coast. If you walk away from the swimmers, there's nothing ahead of you but the great sweep of the coast, the white sand, and the dunes. At the far end of Puheke, the bend of the coast and the distance hide all evidence of other humans. There is a hillside covered in flax and cabbage trees, and the sea is dark blue, washing against the rocks. In summer, on a hot, clear day, there's a kind of animal satisfaction in walking the length of Puheke beach. There is the wind and sun, the roar of the surf, the effort of walking in the heat and finally, at the end, calm in the shelter of the rocks. Everything registering in ear and eye and body; no need for anything else \u2014 no other meaning outside this. </p> <p>\u2022 Charlotte Grimshaw's short story collection, Opportunity, was shortlisted for the 2007 Frank O'Connor International short story prize.

  "<p>Glyndebourne On Tour opens its season with Adrian Noble's 2004 production of Mozart's philosophical comedy revived by Frederic Wake-Walker. Neither of them is to blame for the fact that some of the original show's genuinely magical elements have been downsized for touring purposes. The balloon carrying the Three Boys has gone, the monstrous serpent seems to have shrunk, and <br>the trials by fire and water are an inchoate mess.</p> <p>The visuals are not the only element short-changed. Conductor Douglas Boyd keeps the textures light and airy, but his foot is on the accelerator all evening. The damage comes with the slower, more serious elements of the score, which lack gravitas. Sarastro and his priestly fraternity may be viewed as suspiciously authoritarian these days, but no one suggests they are fooling around. Racing through their music robs them of an essential weighty dignity.</p> <p>Still, the sheer colour of Anthony Ward's oriental designs remains a delight, and many of the cast more than earn their keep. Ana James's Pamina is sung with immaculate control and considerable artistry, though physically she is a little stiff. As Tamino, Lothar Odinius's bright, forward tone shows heldentenor potential, and he is a game player on stage. Daniel Schmutzhard is a winning Papageno, delivering his songs with easy charm and engaging confidently with the comic routines. Carlo Malinverno lacks physical maturity as Sarastro but his highly individual bass is moving.</p> <p>Less successful is Mari Moriya's Queen of the Night. She has to sing the highest notes composed for soprano voice in the standard repertoire, and though pitching them even higher than the ones Mozart wrote is some sort of achievement, it is not what is called for. Dramatically, she fails to hit the necessary combination of glamour and malice. A mixed evening.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe it's because they look like space-age gadgets or maybe it's because ovens and Agas feel more dependable, but slow cookers have fallen out of fashion (a survey by insurer Esure in 2006 revealed that 5.4 million people are letting their slow cookers go unused).</p> <p>For those not afraid to try out the slow cooker, there are many benefits to be had. Slow cooking is not just for stews but also casseroles, curries, Sunday roast and Christmas dinner (taking all the stress out of the busiest time of year). Slow cookers have lower running costs than ovens, and slow cooking makes vegetables and pulses easier to digest (great for those with sensitive stomachs).</p> <p>The idea? Simply pop all the ingredients in the slow cooker pot, plug it in (check that the indicator light is on) and set it on auto cook. Six to eight hours later, dinner is ready. When shopping for a slow cooker check the bowl shape, <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/\">which.co.uk</a> advises: \"a round pot if you plan to only cook stews and curries. Pick an oval pot if you want the option of cooking roast chicken.\" The cookers will come with three main settings, high, medium and low, but the best setting is auto cook \u2014 only some models have this option; it starts high and after an hour switches to the low setting. </p> <p>One of the best slow cookers on the market is the Cuisinart CSC-650U (\u00a369.95, <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/\">johnlewis.com</a>). It's perfect for stews, but not for roasting whole chickens \u2014 joints are the better option. It was voted one of the best buys by <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/\">which.co.uk</a>, it has a large pot (good for families) and a hold setting (which keeps the food warm without it drying out). It also comes with a recipe book and a five-year guarantee.</p> <p>Two other top buys are the Micromark MM9879 (\u00a340, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/\">amazon.co.uk</a>), complete with a recipe book, and the Morphy Richards 48715 (cheap as chips at just \u00a334, <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Home.htm\">argos.co.uk</a>) \u2014 great for roasts, but very heavy.</p>",
  "<p>Ben H's mother-in-law taught us this cheat for taking the tartness out of rhubarb.

Cover and simmer very gently until it's cooked. Meanwhile, make the crumble topping by rubbing the butter into the flour and then mixing the sugar in. Put the rhubarb mixture into a buttered dish and cover with the crumble. Cook for about 40 minutes.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong></p> <p>Surprisingly, one of the regular crumble eaters, Ben H, refused to touch it. Perhaps the colour put him off: that amazing shade of Mountbatten pink may be more enticing to an adult than a child. Asa was having none of it either.</p> <p>Opinion was divided among the others: Ben T found it too sweet, and also prefers his crumble with oats mixed in to make it a bit crunchier, but Paige liked it (prefers apples though) and didn't think it was too sweet at all. Aaargh. Maya liked the crumble, but was having nothing to do with that weird looking rhubarb. Oh no.</p>",

  "<p>There was nothing flash about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/sachin-tendulkar\">Sachin Tendulkar's</a> assumption of the mantle of the greatest run-maker in Test history. A good first-day pitch at Mohali, a post-tea loosener from a debutant bowler, a fraction of width (which is all it takes), an angled, impossibly broad, blade and three scampered runs, to go with the many thousands similarly accrued since his teenaged debut in Karachi all those years ago.</p> <p>Tendulkar has been sublimely gifted as few others have been, capable of the most vivid, brutal strokeplay against the finest bowling. But underpinning it all has been efficiency, founded on technical excellence, an analytical brain, meticulous planning and unwavering concentration. It was as if those three runs, which helped him towards 88 yesterday, were preordained in their quiet simplicity to showcase the countless hours as boy and man that have been poured into developing a supreme talent into the player he has become.</p> <p>The achievement serves to restart the debate over which of the record-holders should be regarded as the greatest of modern batsmen. Wisden, after considerable counselling across a broad spectrum of opinions, had no doubt that Sir Vivian Richards was pre-eminent, but he never held the record. The first batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs, posting on the way what then seemed a preposterous 34 Test centuries, was Sunil Gavaskar, the Indian genius, balanced and focussed, capable of incendiary batting and stodge as the mood took him. From Gavaskar, short of stature like Tendulkar and from the same upper echelons of Bombay society, the young man drew inspiration and gained a pair of grubby yellowing lightweight pads. </p> <p>It was the feisty, tenacious Australian Allan Border who superceded Gavaskar's Test-match total (if not his tally of centuries), a product of single-mindedness during the bad years and ruthlessness during the start of the glory times. He rationalised his attacking game, reducing it to a few workmanlike strokes - a check-drive through extra-cover, a cut, a pull and accumulation off his legs were, he deemed, sufficient - and they took him beyond 11,000 runs. Someone to bat for your life in heat, humidity and with a broken digit.</p> <p>Brian Lara overtook Border's record one day in Adelaide, with no more than an unobtrusive left-hander's flick down to fine-leg. No other player has scaled such peaks as Lara while his team floundered in a sea of mediocrity. Lara saw milestones and simply pressed the pedal to the floor to go past them. He was a young man when he made the highest individual Test innings, held so long by Sir Garfield Sobers, at the Recreation Ground in Antigua but a decade older when, on the same ground, he retrieved it from Matthew Hayden. An exercise in self-indulgence it may have been, virtually guaranteeing a draw, but imagine the discipline and drive to succeed. Lara has shredded the finest, playing some of the game's most destructive and match-winning innings. Facing high pace was his only weakness.</p> <p>All the while, Tendulkar has been climbing the ladder. His has not been a lone journey as Lara's had been, surrounded as he has been by such as Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Virender Sehwag. Increasingly he has battled with injury, the most debilitating that to his elbow, a product perhaps of the unnaturally heavy bat he uses. Yet still, even when in apparent decline, and urged to retire before the game forces him out, he has produced majestic innings, most recently in Australia. Still he makes centuries against the best, capable of such self-denial in pursuit of excellence that he could take a double-century from a tricky surface in Sydney by totally excluding the cover-drive that has been a staple throughout his career. </p> <p>So who has been the best of these champions? Shane Warne, whom we should respect in this matter, rates the pantheon of those he played against as Tendulkar first, then daylight, then Lara. Coming up strongly, and almost certain to set new standards both in terms of runs and centuries, is Ricky Ponting who may render the argument superfluous. Lara in full flight was just awe-inspiring, vulnerability always a possibility but somehow never materialising. Tendulkar at his peak, though, has been the complete batsmen of his day and for now, just as we did with Lara, we can salute him as such.</p>",
  "<p>Warnings that the graduate recruitment market will \"tighten\" next year will come as no surprise to the class of 2009. Graduating in the midst of some of the toughest economic conditions for many years, final-year students can expect to encounter fierce competition over the next few months for the smaller pool of graduate vacancies available.</p> <p>Faced with such sobering facts, it would be perfectly reasonable for students to feel a sense of panic. However, instead of focusing on doom and gloom, the smart set are getting their heads down and working harder. Preparation is the key and one of the best ways to do this is by forging links with prospective employers at careers fairs.</p> <p>\"Telling students who are coming up to graduation to go to a careers fair is one of the first pieces of advice I give out,\" says Carl Gilleard, chief executive of the Association of Graduate Recruiters. \"It is imperative that they keep in touch with what is happening in the market \u2014 and what better place to do this than at a big graduate fair, where you've got a host of employers under the same roof?\"</p> <p>While Gilleard is certain that graduate recruitment will decrease over the next year, he is also sure that it isn't going to collapse, so advises students to maintain a sense of perspective and widen their options by not ruling certain industry sectors out.</p> <p>\"People who are narrow-minded in their approach to careers will find it more difficult ,\" he warns. \"A careers fair is the perfect place to find out the situation, so make sure you ask how many vacancies are available. If employers are at a fair, you can assume they are recruiting. So be flexible and spend time going around stands that you wouldn't normally target .\"</p> <p>Learning to be flexible about your future career may be one of the most important skills graduates can learn, says Hilary Moor, an MBA careers adviser for Royal Holloway, University of London, who is leading a presentation on alternative careers to investment banking this Tuesday at The Guardian London Graduate Fair from The Careers Group, which is taking place at the Business Design Centre in London. </p> <p>\"The market is changing so fast at the moment, trying to predict where the jobs are going to be is really hard,\" Moor says. \" Try and think about which sectors may still be growing as a result of the financial crisis , for example, areas like accountancy and regulatory bodies . Alternatively, look at other organisations like the NHS, which has financial arms that will allow you to develop your skills and interests while not being exposed to the fluctuations in recruitment within investment banking.\"</p> <p>Brian Starling is head of human resources at commodity traders Triland Metals. He says that careers fairs are an important part of the application process for employers and advises candidates to make a good impression.</p> <p>\"The main reason we attend careers fairs is because we like to use them as the first point of contact - it's a good chance for the employer and the graduate to size each other up,\" he says.</p> <p>\"If we do our job properly then we sell the company to the graduate and at the same time we screen out the people who we feel wouldn't be suitable for our scheme. It also gives graduates a chance to make an impression on us so when their application does turn up through the online system, it is not just a name but somebody whom we have met before.\" </p> <p>Another element of a careers fair that graduates can take advantage of is the diverse range of workshops and presentations on offer to help you hone your skills. Terry Jones, a careers adviser for The Careers Group, is running an interview technique session and says this is one of the skills prospective candidates most want to perfect.</p> <p>\"Graduates worry about their performance in interviews - it is an unnatural situation and there is a fear of failure attached to it,\" he explains. \"The interview technique session is incredibly popular, as it helps to address some of those anxieties. The main focus is for graduates to think about what it is like on the other side of the table. What are interviewers actually looking for?\"</p> <p>While Jones admits that the application process is set to get more competitive in the future, he says that by taking steps now to build your confidence, you can ensure you have a headstart over your peers.</p> <p>\"If you are applying for good jobs the process is always going to be tough,\" he advises. \"To put yourself in the best position, make sure you are exposed to the market by attending fairs and learning what you can about how the application system works. That way, you stand a better chance.\"</p> <h2>'Do whatever you can to stand out'</h2> <p><strong>Josh Morris</strong>, 23, is an account executive at commodity traders Triland Metals. He first met the company a year ago at a careers fair after graduating with a environmental geoscience degree from the University of Bristol</p> <p>'After graduating in 2007 I ran a restaurant in Oxford for a few months, as an interim job. However, when I decided I wanted to find a graduate position I went straight to a graduate recruitment fair because I was looking for an event that was tailored to degree-level job seekers.</p> <p>'I knew I wanted to work in financial services, so when I saw the Triland stand and realised they worked in the sector, I decided to approach them. I hadn't heard of the company before and I only had a limited idea of what they did, so after starting the application process that day I went away and did some more research on the company before I was eventually called for interview.</p> <p>'The best thing about the careers fair was that it was nice to deal with a real person rather than wondering if your CV was landing on a desk somewhere and not being looked at or making an online application. I also felt that meeting the Triland recruiter in person made a big difference to my chances of success. I had applied to a number of companies online before and got nothing back.</p> <p>'My advice to graduates wanting to work in financial services at the moment is to do whatever you can to stand out from the crowd. The next couple of years are going to be quite difficult, as the labour market will be flooded with people who have a lot more experience than your average graduate. You could do yourself a lot of favours by going along to a graduate fair, so you are more than just a name on an application form.</p> <p>'It will also help you to be better informed about what career options are available to you. If you go to an exhibitor's stand they can tell you a lot more about what they do and what specific aspects of the company you can become involved in.

  "<h2>How can I find out about teaching A-level art or photography?</h2> <p>I 'd love to teach art or photography at sixth-form level but I cannot find out what I would need for the role. It seems there 's an abundance of information on becoming an English, maths or science teacher, but not about teaching art. The Training and Development Agency is the main source of information on school teaching careers and its website (<a href=\"http://www.teach.gov.uk\">teach.gov.uk</a>) provides masses of information . But the subjects it highlights do not include art; its page on secondary subjects focuses on shortage areas which attract extra funding. However, the information on entry requirements, training, getting work experience and events is relevant to every subject. Check out the section on getting teaching experience. You can also talk to an adviser via the Teaching Information Line on 0845 6000 991.</p> <p>As your interest is teaching over-16s, look also at colleges as well as schools with sixth forms.

  "<p>'Everyone's always very surprised, actually,\" says Becky Evans. \"When they come into the ops rooms they think it's going to be some mad hubbub of craziness.\" And she is right. Arriving at the National Air Traffic Control Centre at Swanwick, I did indeed think that. But it isn't. Instead, a mood of nonchalant tranquillity fills the vast, white chamber below us, from where almost all of the aircraft over England and Wales are being controlled.</p> <p>Casually dressed staff chat calmly in front of their computers. When I am allowed in for a peep, one man is even reading a newspaper in his expensive chair. \"Pensions announcement to be made today,\" promises a large, illuminated screen behind him, while four stuffed animals hang forgotten above everything - suspended from the ceiling years ago, I am told, by some office wag. It all looks rather like the lair of a progressive Bond villain, perhaps during the early consultation stages of his next diabolical scheme.</p> <p>\"It's very quiet,\" says Evans almost gleefully. \"It's a very controlled environment, that's the only way I can describe it. We know when aircraft are going to arrive in the sector, and you know what you have to do with them. And then you pass them on to the next guy.\" It sounds a disarmingly simple way of describing a very complex job.</p> <p>And though Evans seems a master of it now, she only got into air traffic control, quite literally, by accident. All set to join the army after university, she snapped a ligament in her knee and was rejected on medical grounds. While she was looking around for alternatives, a friend who had already begun training as a controller recommended the air traffic service. \"And the more I read about it,\" she says, \"the more I thought, ooh that sounds right up my street.\"</p> <p>So in 1998, aged 21, she headed straight for the College of Air Traffic Control in Bournemouth. And after three years of training, and having passed her final exams, she was ready to start moving real planes. Was she nervous that first time? \"You're probably wanting me to say that it was more of a moment than it was,\" she suggests, accurately. \"But you have been doing this training for such a long time, and during the training you also do periods on the job where you go to a unit or a tower. So it's not like that's the first time you've ever spoken to them on the radio. It wasn't that much of a thing.\"</p> <p>It is still taking me a little time to accept that while hundreds of lives depend on Evans doing her job properly, she has always been perfectly calm about it. \"Everybody thinks it's a really stressful job,\" she says. \"But I don't find it stressful. It's very rewarding and satisfying when you've done it, and you've been sitting there for an hour and a half and it's all gone really smoothly. There are moments of high pressure, but the training that you do is such that you're taught to deal with it. It just becomes second nature, almost.\"</p> <p>In Evans's case, this pressure usually means having to deal with the busy times when there are around 25 aircraft an hour jostling for her attention. In her patch of sky - the area above the south-west of England and the southernmost half of Wales - this happens most often at around 4am, as many flights from America begin descending towards London, and then peaks again from 10am, when another surge of planes heads off west once more.</p> <p>The more dramatic types of pressure, of course, are very rare. Evans reels off a list of different systems each of which is designed to prevent mid-air collisions, and it certainly sounds as if there are enough of them. While other emergencies happen so infrequently that only once, in eight years as an air traffic controller, has she ever had to deal with one. So then, what does happen in an emergency? \"If an aircraft says it's got an engine failure or a decompression or something, then there's nothing you can do about that,\" she says, with what sounds like well-honed realism. \"It's not within your control; you just have to deal with it as best you can at the time.\" </p> <p>Usually, this means clearing everything out of its way so the plane can land as soon as possible. And so it proved in Evans's own emergency. \"There was smoke in the cockpit,\" she remembers. \"A guy that was getting airborne from Bristol, he called me and said 'Pan, pan, pan, pan!' Pan is like a warning. 'Mayday' means big disaster, need to get down immediately, and 'pan' is the next one down. It's not as serious, basically.\"</p> <p>So what happened? \"There was nothing wrong with his aircraft, but he wasn't sure what was going on while there was smoke in the cockpit, so he said, 'I want to land immediately.' And Brize Norton is just there, which has a huge runway. So he took off from Bristol, went up two or three thousand feet, and then landed at Brize. And he was absolutely fine.\" She still cannot resist a little smile at the memory of this comically tiny flight.</p> <p>It is interesting to listen to the way Evans tells this story - about \"him\", as if just one man was involved, when in fact \"he\" was the pilot of a jet full of passengers. It is a reminder that, while other members of her team plan routes and manage traffic flows, her job is fundamentally about talking to people - albeit in the coded language of the skies. \"Speedbird123 climb flight level 300,\" for instance, would mean \"British Airways flight 123, please could you fly up to an altitude of 30,000ft? Thanks awfully.\"</p> <p>Besides this, though Evans has heard every imaginable voice and accent, there is little room for conversation. \"You do have the chit-chat in as much as you say 'goodbye' when they leave your frequency,\" she observes drily. \"And every now and then, if there's a big England game on or something, somebody will pipe up and say, 'If you've got a minute, what's the England score?' Then we have to send one of the boys off to find out so you can tell them. But that is only when it's really, really quiet.\"</p> <p>When it's busy, on the other hand, competition between pilots can be fierce over who gets the best slots, in which they can save the most fuel. As a result, not every one of Evans's conversations is straightforward. \"Sometimes pilots will not realise how busy you are and they will push you for things,\" she shrugs. \"You just have to say, 'No, I can't do that.' So you have to be confident in what you're doing, and be prepared to say no.\"</p> <p>Attempting instead to explain the complexity of her workload, which she shares with two other team members, would certainly be almost impossible. \"I've tried with my mum for hours and never managed it,\" Evans admits. Nevertheless, she walks me over to a map on the wall to have another go. The main transatlantic artery seems straightforward enough, travelling northwest from London over Wales. Around it, she points out numerous smaller airports and subsidiary routes, all of whose climbing and descending traffic have to be mixed together without one plane ever being less than five miles in front of, or 1,000ft above, another. And that includes when a thunderstorm blocks the way. Or if fog suddenly makes an airport unusable. </p> <p>\"And we've got a lot of Manchester departures,\" she continues, slicing a great vertical line through the middle of everything. \"So then you're mixing that in with all those Heathrow departures, and choosing levels in the middle that are going to make them all, erm, miss, obviously.\" She chuckles. But she has not finished.</p> <p>\"Then you've got faster aircraft and slower aircraft. You can't have a slower aircraft with a faster one right behind it doing the same thing. So you tell them to fly to these radar headings to keep them separated.\" Her fingers speedily traverse the map, which is splodged with coloured symbols, as if she were trying to separate all the strands in a bowl of moving spaghetti. </p> <p>When she flies, I can't help but wonder, is she thinking about all this? \"Yes,\" she admits. \"Because it's your airspace, you know ... We went to Barbados last year as a quick last-minute holiday before my daughter was born. We came in through Gatwick, and it was actually really nice, because it was a glorious morning just looking out over the south coast. And of course you know exactly what you're doing ... I was thinking, I wonder who's working? Because obviously everybody who does this bit of airspace I know. You just wish you could go up to the front and sit in the cockpit, and go, 'Hello!'\" Her face falls. \"But it doesn't quite work like that.\" For just a moment, she looks genuinely disappointed.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay </strong>\"A full-time controller who has been working for a number of years can earn about \u00a390,000pa. As I'm part-time, and I'm not at the top of the scale either, I think I'm on a shade under \u00a350,000.\"</p> <p><strong>Hours </strong>\"A full shift pattern is two morning shifts, two afternoon shifts, two night shifts and then four days off. I do two afternoon shifts, a day off, two morning shifts, and then five days off. And then I do it again. Shifts are eight hours, but you can only work a maximum of an hour and a half before you have a half-hour break.\"</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance </strong>Good. \"My husband is also a controller, and we've got a daughter who was born a year ago. So I am now part-time, and my shifts are opposite to Martin's, which means we can do all the childcare ourselves. Which is fantastic, actually.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing </strong>\"Working as part of a team. And the time off, I really enjoy that.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing </strong>\"Getting up really early is not good. And because of the shift work, we do every day of the year. Christmas Day, New Year's Day ... every day is just an air traffic day.\"</p>",
  "<p>I'm not sure who said it first, but I agree with the sentiment: \"A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\" We're all struggling to make sense of the financial crisis that has spread around the world. One of my worries is that many of us will learn the wrong lessons - specifically, that we will become too risk-averse, that we will learn to fear creativity rather than embrace it.</p> <p>It's easy to portray the credit crunch as a study of creativity out of control. Who's the genius that invented subprime loans? Weren't we all better off before the creation of a $500tn (\u00a3285tn) market in derivatives, the hard-to-understand financial contracts that are at the root of so much of what's gone wrong? Shouldn't we declare, once and for all, that our fascination with \"disruptive\" technologies, \"breakthrough\" innovations, and financial \"reengineering\" does more harm than good?</p> <p>Warren Buffet, one of the world's richest men, offered valuable advice on this score in a recent television interview. At one point, he was asked the question on all our minds: \"Should wise people have known better?\" Of course, they should, Buffet replied, but there's a \"natural progression\" to how good new ideas go wrong. He called this progression the \"three 'I's\". First come the innovators, who see opportunities that others don't. Then come the imitators, who copy the innovators. And then come the idiots, whose avarice undoes the very innovations they are trying to use to get rich.</p> <p>The problem, in other words, isn't with innovation - it's with the idiocy that follows. So how do we as individuals (not to mention as companies and societies) continue to embrace the value-creating upside of creativity while guarding against the value-destroying downsides of imitation? The answer, it seems to me, is about values - about always distinguishing between that which is smart and that which is expedient. And that takes discipline. Can you distinguish between a genuine innovation and a mindless imitation? Are you prepared to walk away from ideas that promise to make money, even if they make no sense?</p> <p>It's not easy - which is why so many of us fall prey to bad ideas. \"People don't get smarter about things as basic as greed,\" Buffet told his interviewer. \"You can't stand to see your neighbour getting rich. You know you're smarter than he is, but he's doing all these [crazy] things, and he's getting rich ... so pretty soon you start doing it.\"</p> <p>Andrew Oswald, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick, has a more poetic way of making the same point. Oswald is a pioneer of a field that might be called \"happiness economics\" - the study of the interplay between money and human satisfaction. His rigorous academic work confirms the advice that we hear in our churches and from our shrinks - the relentless pursuit of wealth may fill your bank account, but it will leave you empty as a human being.</p> <p>\"The curse of humanity is that people feel compelled to look over their shoulders,\" Oswald told a colleague of mine a while back. \"Happiness and self-esteem depend on rank and relative income. We are consumed by relativism. If your neighbour drives up in a new Lexus, and you're still driving the Toyota that you were perfectly satisfied with yesterday, you start to become dissatisfied.\"</p> <p>So don't use the financial crisis as an excuse to stop taking chances or to your ambitions. But do use it to take stock of what really matters - and stop looking over your shoulder. </p> <p>\u2022 William C Taylor is the co-author of Mavericks at Work: Why the Most Original Minds in Business Win, published by Harper at \u00a312.99.

  "<h2>Playlist: Bye bye doesn't mean forever </h2> <p><strong>Slipping Through My Fingers by Abba</strong></p> <p>\"The feeling that I'm losing her forever/And without really entering her world/ I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter/That funny little girl/Slipping through my fingers all the time ... \"</p> <p>My mother and I went to see Mamma Mia! in the cinema, enjoying it immensely and singing along under our breath in the less than full afternoon screening at our local cinema.</p> <p>During this song, the background music to the daughter's wedding preparations, I looked over to see tears in my mum's eyes. My mum does not cry. In my whole life I have only seen her cry perhaps a dozen times and usually it scares me because it is so rare. This time it didn't. The girl in the film is 20, the same age as me, and hearing the heroine reminiscing about her daughter, whom she fears she is losing, must have struck a chord with my mum.</p> <p>A year ago, I started university, moving to London and leaving the house my mum and I have shared for 12 years. I would like her to know that she will never lose me, that without her, this past year would have been impossible. I love her more each day and despite all, I will always be her funny little girl and I will never slip through her fingers. <br><strong>Jessica Glaisher</strong></p> <h2>A letter to ... My forever faffing family </h2> <p>You should be familiar with the word faffing, considering it describes an offence of which unfortunately you are repeat offenders. If you are unsure as to what I refer, allow me to elaborate. Try to think back to the last time we were at the cinema, or the theatre. Now picture the hall when we depart, and you will notice that, due to your exceptional abilities at faffing, no one else is left, unless of course it is one of those special occasions when people have started to arrive for the next showing.</p> <p>However, that short paragraph does by no means capture the range of your procrastinations. Of course, different offences are committed by different members, but sisters, love you as I do, you do sometimes epitomise the very word faffing. </p> <p>Take, for example, your shoes. We go to leave the house, obviously late because, well, that's our family, and you realise that despite the fact that your shoes should really only take a minute to put on, you can't find the pair that you want, so we have to hunt around the house until we find the ideal pair. What particularly amazes me, though, is that you don't learn, because it happens time and time again. Sticking with the theme of shoes, why oh why do you have to take your shoes off when we go in the car? Even the shortest journey, that you probably wouldn't even bother wearing a seat belt for, the shoes come off. But of course they move about, as things in cars tend to, and - what do you know? - we have to look for them again and for some reason they take ages to put on! So we arrive at dinner to find the tea is cold and everyone has left. But enough about you two, because by no means are you solely responsible.</p> <p>Mum, where to begin? Should I start with the phone conversations that seem to go on for several millennia, or is it the endless collection of coats that make it impossible to get anything out of the coat cupboard. </p> <p>The phone thing is central to your role as a faffer, because more often than not, we come to the time when we are supposed to actually arrive at the house we are visiting, and you're still on the phone! And then, of course, you must change because God forbid you would be seen outside the house in the same outfit twice in the same day. So while I stand by the door gradually getting more and more irritable, you go upstairs to get lost in a world of handbags and shoes, and return down the stairs after a considerable time with just a change of top.</p> <p>Still, there are other members of the family left to cover. I can tell for a moment, Dad, that you thought you were going to get away with it. But no. You see, I have finally realised something about you, that the most important room in the house to you is your hideout, otherwise known as the downstairs toilet, a room where you can delve into the joys of the newspaper. Unfortunately, due to your inbuilt faffing gene, you tend to choose your moments of escape just before we leave the house. I mean, please, all I'm asking for is a bit of forward planning. Most of the time you decide to vanish for an unbelievably long time just as we get into the car. There is something else I have begun to notice about our invitations to any form of event. The hosts have started to invite us an hour earlier than everyone else. Worse, sometimes that's not long enough. </p> <p>I will make a plea to you all: for once I would like to arrive somewhere on time or - dare I say it - early, so that I can have a hot cup of tea, talk to people and maybe grab a slice of cake. Really, it's not too much to ask. </p> <p>Mum and Dad, you are grown adults, most of the time. Girls, you are now over the age of 10, and for some reason people think you're mature. So come on, you can make this a present to me - a day of blissful punctuality, when we don't get pitying looks as we traipse through the door making some excuse about the traffic. Should you fail to provide this perfect day, I will have to take matters into my own hands, and I have already made a contingency plan. First, turn off the central heating in winter, so that you will all have to wear coats and proper shoes. Then I will barricade the downstairs toilet, hide the newspaper and cut the phone lines. </p> <p>So please, I beg you, make faffing history! <br><strong>Mark</strong></p> <h2>We love to eat ... Mum's speedy grated apple </h2> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br>One apple <br>Sugar or honey<br>Raisins</p> <p>The apple tree in our garden was temperamental, yielding either no fruit or enough to fill the entire lawn. In those years where there was a glut, my brother and I would play tennis with the extra apples. But my mother would take the ripest fruit first to make us a rare but wonderful treat.</p> <p>The dish is very simple; peel a just ripe apple and grate it into a bowl. The apple goes brown very quickly after being exposed to the air, so the idea is to eat the dish as quickly as possible. The apple is delicious on its own, but sugar or honey and raisins go down well too, if you can spare the time to put them in before the apple turns brown. Despite remonstrations that we would get indigestion, this was the one dish it was acceptable to scoff. <br><strong>Izzy Kaminski</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Relationship break-up left a colleague feeling bereft - how can I help?</h2> <p><strong>I run a small business with a small office team and a wide range of freelancers. The first person I employed was a young man who has proved a real boon. I have become good friends with him on a purely work basis. He is highly skilled and has drawn praise from all our clients. However, he is somewhat socially gauche and unconfident. </strong></p> <p><strong>I felt until recently that this was improving and I gave him more responsibility. The problem stems from the acrimonious breakdown of his long-term, live-in relationship, that resulted in personal distress and money worries. I and my colleagues are doing our best to be supportive. He has done his best, though his work has suffered. He is a valuable employee and I hope and believe the problems of poor concentration and exhaustion are temporary. </strong></p> <p><strong>The thing is, his recent experiences have seemed to make him regress and he now appears even more gauche and immature. He has very uncertain body language and cannot even sit up straight - he winds himself round his chair and fiddles with his face. It's starting to irritate me - it doesn't give a good impression and also I feel he needs to sort it out in order to make the best of himself in the future. </strong></p> <p><strong>I worry that this is a far longer-term problem and I can't think that there is a quick fix. I need to improve the situation but I do not want to jeopardise our very good relationship. What can I do for him? Should I offer him training in presenting himself, or in interview technique?</strong></p> <p>I'm more than usually hesitant to give advice when there's a very fair chance that what someone initially needs is a professional consultation. From what you tell me about your colleague, this could well be the case with him. </p> <p>You say you're anxious not to jeopardise your good relationship. From this I infer, perhaps wrongly, that you haven't yet had a proper face-to-face conversation with him. If so, I think you must: ideally out of the office and with plenty of time at your disposal.</p> <p>I'm sure I don't have to tell you of the need for extreme sensitivity and gentleness of approach. I'm not recommending a confrontation or anything like it. You should start with the lightest of suggestions that he might like to speak about himself; it's entirely possible that since the break-up with his partner, he's had no one to talk to. If so, he could be more than ready to open up. On the other hand, if he initially seems to put up the shutters, you may have to increase the pressure a little.</p> <p>But however this conversation develops, there's one quite critical fact you must establish - and that's whether or not he's consulted his GP. And if he hasn't, which seems possible, do please try to get him to promise you he will. You may well think this to be outside your carefully defined professional limits and even intrusive. And so may he. But he clearly needs help and you want to give it. And until he's had the benefit of a proper medical consultation, and has shared the outcome with you, you can't possibly know how to help him most usefully.</p> <p>If you're successful in persuading him to follow this course, the rest may follow more naturally. But I'd quite understand if you felt deeply uneasy at such a level of involvement in someone else's life: you can't just dip in and then out again. </p> <h2>Overwork has ruined my reputation - should I try to repair it or quit?</h2> <p><strong>For the past three years I have been working directly to the senior management team of a recently launched organisation. While the work has been really interesting, my team has been severely understaffed. We have had to work a minimum of 12 hours per day and at weekends. </strong></p> <p><strong>After three years of this I am very stressed and have developed a reputation across the rest of the organisation for being short-tempered and unwilling to take on work. This is not how I want to be perceived. </strong></p> <p><strong>It does look as though there is light at the end of the tunnel. The additional staff members that we were promised over a year ago by the management team should take up their posts shortly, so my staff should be able to reduce their hours. </strong></p> <p><strong>I've been offered another post by a rival organisation which I am keen to take, but in the meantime I want to build relations where I work - at the moment I am physically dreading going into work each day. I would be grateful for your advice on what, if anything, I can do.</strong></p> <p>I have a great deal of sympathy with your predicament. There's another job waiting which you'd like to take but you simply hate the thought of leaving your present company still shrouded with a reputation for being workshy and ratty. You know that's not your natural self; it's the inevitable consequence of three stressed years of overwork.</p> <p>I was originally tempted to advise you to hang on in there, wait for those reinforcements to arrive - and then hope that a much reduced workload would quickly allow you to be widely seen as the equable and conscientious person you naturally are. But the recognition of a cruel truth deterred me: no reputation is reversed overnight. It has to be faced that you'd be lumbered with yours, however unjustly, until a fair proportion of total company staff had turned over. And that could take years. You absolutely mustn't subject yourself to that risk.</p> <p>So hold on just long enough to ensure your team is really going to get the relief they so desperately need. Then double-check the new job to see it's really all you hope for - and then go for it. You won't have let anyone down, your sense of relief will be immediate, and an entirely new environment and set of colleagues will let you shed that old reputation as you walk through the door for the very first time.</p> <p>\u2022 For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"http://work@theguardian.com.\">work@theguardian.com.</a> Please note that Jeremy is unable to answer questions of a legal nature or reply personally. </p> <p>\u2022 Jeremy's book, Another Bad Day At The Office?, is published by Penguin at \u00a36.99.

  "<p>The Indian literary novel may be riding high, but there is such a shortage of crime fiction set in India's capital that Vikas Swarup can be considered a pioneer after producing this whopping book. Six Suspects attempts to expose the contract killing and fraud that bedevils Delhi. The plot is based on the murder of Jessica Lall, a model, in a bar in 1999. Here, the victim is Ruby Gill, a Gandhian scholar and bartender who is shot dead after she refuses to serve a notorious industrialist and movie producer. </p> <p>Vivek \"Vicky\" Rai has already run over pavement dwellers with his BMW and poached endangered blackbuck antelope. Thanks to his father, the corrupt home minister of Uttar Pradesh, he has never served jail time; not surprisingly, he is acquitted of Ruby's murder. During a gala to celebrate his acquittal, however, he is killed. Six gun-wielding guests are arrested, and this sprawling, facetious tome traces the intertwining paths that led these disparate individuals to Vicky's farmhouse.</p> <p>There is the retired bureaucrat Mohan Kumar who, when not \"playing sudoku on his laptop and surfing porn sites\", helps Vicky's family exploit India's labour and natural resources. One evening Mohan attends a soir\u00e9e, where a guru will channel the ghost of Gandhi for Delhi's aptly satirised glitterati. The s\u00e9ance is interrupted by murderous nationalists, and in the mayhem Mohan becomes possessed by what appears to be the ghost of Gandhi - which, despite its pacifist inclinations, wants to avenge the death of Ruby Gill. For the rest of the novel, Mohan alternates between pontificating on the merits of abstinence and re-inhabiting his former, sleazy self. These tracts are intolerably monotonous and predictable. </p> <p>Also cumbersome are Swarup's hackneyed descriptions and daft aphorisms, though he does have a redeeming eye for the disparities that define Indian society. The fast-paced dialogues between Vicky's father, the home minister, and his various underlings illustrate well the corruption that burdens Indian bureaucracy. At one point, the home minister moves to ban the film of The Da Vinci Code, in order to stir communal sentiment: \"If I ban the film our party will get some Christian votes in the local elections.\" </p> <p>This is one of the innumerable instances in which Swarup borrows from actual political events, but his attempts to graft front-page headlines on to plot make for superficial, encyclopaedic reading. And despite trying to shove in everything Indian under the sun, Swarup makes one notable omission. He steers clear of the Gujarat riots of 2002, in which Hindu activists committed pogroms against Muslim citizens. Likewise, when he enters politically tense Kashmir, he lampoons autocratic and ignorant America and Islamic fanaticism. There is nothing wrong with that, but Swarup, an Indian diplomat, lets the Indian government off the hook. This is inexcusable.</p> <p>In the end, Vicky Rai's murder is pinned on an innocent tribesman from the Andaman Islands, and a stream of encores await. All fail to pack a punch. Swarup has attempted an ambitious, complex project that required more cooking time, fewer plot lines and liberation from the desire to write a \"great Indian novel\".</p> <p>\u2022 Hirsh Sawhney is the editor of Delhi Noir, to be published by Akashic Books.

  "<p>\u2022 There were many strange moments during the judging process for this year's Man Booker prize, but the strangest for me came when I and my fellow judges - Michael Portillo (the chair), James Heneage, Alex Clark and Hardeep Singh Kohli - were having lunch after the longlist meeting. Thanks to Michael's firmness, the decision-making had been quick - 40 minutes to select our favourite 13 books from 116 entries. Before the meeting, he had asked us all to submit our lists of top 10 favourites to him, without collusion. This process produced nine titles that received votes from the majority of the panel - in other words, three judges or more. Michael proposed that those nine had won their places on the longlist without further ado. That left only four places on the list to be debated. </p> <p>The two novels on my personal list that didn't make it were People of the Book by Geraldine Brooks and Late Nights on Air by Elizabeth Hay, both of which I loved, but I had to accept my enthusiasm was not shared. Books in the running for those last four longlist slots were ones that were voted for by one or two judges, but also partially admired by others who had not found room for them in their top 10. One such was Joseph O'Neill's Netherland, which scraped its way on to the longlist despite our shared reservations because of its evocative portrayal of a post-9/11 New York.</p> <p>Netherland was first out of the blocks as bookies' favourite, and in the following weeks its author was splashed all over the papers beneath headlines that declared him \"hotly tipped\" to win. Not by us, he wasn't. The person this was most unfair on was O'Neill, who could have been forgiven for filling his ice box with champagne and rushing his tuxedo down to the dry cleaners. Next up as favourite was Salman Rushdie with The Enchantress of Florence, who had bunny-hopped on to our longlist with ease, only to be excluded from the shortlist four weeks later with equal unanimity. Booker judges snub Rushdie, or similar, was the headline in the papers. No, we didn't. We just thought the six books that did make it were better. </p> <p>I went into the final meeting thinking that, although I would be happy for any one of our top six to take the prize, there were three that had nudged ahead for me, one of which was our eventual winner, Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger. I was also entranced by Sebastian Barry's The Secret Scripture, a beautiful novel about an old lady in an Irish asylum reflecting back on her life. It wasn't that I didn't want The White Tiger to win, just that I didn't want The Secret Scripture to lose. At one point during our discussions, we double-checked with Ion Trewin, the chair of the prize committee, if we could split it. No, we couldn't. In the end, it came to a tense secret ballot and The White Tiger, a superbly executed novel about poverty and corruption in modern India, inched ahead of its competition. At which moment, we all paused to draw breath and blink at each other, suddenly silent after hours of impassioned and, at times, tearful debate.<br><strong>Louise Doughty</strong></p> <p>\u2022 So the government has retreated, for now. Although 42-day detention has been dropped from the counter-terrorism bill, the home secretary has said that the measure will be brought to parliament in a separate piece of legislation \"if needed\". When might that be? At a time when it might seem more effective as a piece of political posturing? None of this is about making us safer. It's about making the government look tougher. And while the current banking crisis meant that it was a good day to bury bad news on the climb-down, it's not too difficult to envisage another day in the future, after another terrorist incident, for example, when the priorities shift back. The government will be there shouting \"we told you so\". </p> <p>It's possible to win the battle and lose the war. We already have provisions for 28-day detention without trial. That is more than twice as long as any other common-law country. Australia has the next longest, at 12 days. That we have already accepted the erosion of habeas corpus - the only true basis of freedom and democracy - to this extent is worrying. More vigilance is required.</p> <p>42 Writers for Liberty: <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/42writers/\">liberty-human-rights.org.uk/42writers/</a><br><strong>Monica Ali</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It is with difficulty that we pardon a man for being both great and illustrious. But we do so even less, if he combines these qualities, for being silent too. In the empire of noise, silence is a crime. The person who refuses to bare himself, to make public pronouncements above and beyond his work, is an annoyance and an obvious target. Milan Kundera has expressed himself fully in his work. He has talked about himself, about his life, in discrete pieces, inhabiting imaginary characters (\"experimental selves\"), examining our human discomfort and trying to discover a way out. He has never given in to the tacit demand that a writer should also be a guide, a philosopher (his essays are so many forms of questioning) a historian, or in a more pernicious way, a man who must justify himself. </p> <p>As an individual, Kundera keeps himself, in solitude, to one side of his work, a fugitive from what he calls \"l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement\": \"What is an '\u00e9v\u00e9nement'? A news item so important that it attracts media attention. Yet a novel is written not to create an \u00e9v\u00e9nement, but to make something which will last.\" </p> <p>And now here is a document, a deposition dating from 1950, the authenticity of which no one is in a position to guarantee, dug up 60 years after the events which it describes and published all over the world, which arrives tragically to impose itself in the form of an \u00e9v\u00e9nement. </p> <p>\"I was totally taken aback by this thing,\" he said, \"which I did not expect at all, which even yesterday I knew nothing of, and which did not take place.\" I am infinitely touched by the awkward turn of phrase which combines in the word thing both the appearance of this police report itself and the act of which he is accused. But nevertheless something has taken place. What has taken place is the irrelevant media frenzy, the ambiguity of certain headlines, the appalling conditional tense (\"may have denounced\"...), even more sly and accusatory than a direct statement, what has taken place is the introduction of doubt, a stain, a shadow which has suddenly been cast over an exceptional life and work. </p> <p>And above all, which is my reason for writing these lines, there is the absolute impotence of a man faced with such a chain of events. He has no possible response. Having made an immediate denial, anything he might say would only feed the process of accusation. In thirty seconds it is possible to sweep away the life of a man with an honest sense of having done one's job and one's duty. No serious inquiry is made, and most often no care in the broadcasting of information which itself is still subject to caution. Words are biassed towards the real. Spoken or written, they take unforeseen paths which can lead to destruction. They must be stopped in time. <br><strong>Yasmina Reza</strong></p> <p>\u2022 \"They don't ban books any more, or at least not recently, which is a relief and a small step forward,\" I wrote in a preface to my latest book on Pakistan, The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power, after explaining how the previous two had been, at different times, banned by military dictators. I was wrong. I had foolishly assumed that since General Musharraf had not banned books, his civilian, supposedly democratic, successors would also stay the course. The Pakistani distributors of my publisher, Simon and Schuster, which had no problems selling ghostwritten volumes by Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto, have for the past four weeks been waiting for \"clearance\" from the ministry of information (ie propaganda) to import my book. The minister, Sherry Rehman, is a former Karachi journalist. Her public embrace of Sarah Palin notwithstanding, she had a reasonable civil liberties record, often preached the virtues of legality, political morality, civic virtues, freedom and equality. They lie now at her feet, broken and scattered shards as the government stumbles from one crisis to another. </p> <p>Her friends tell me she is not responsible for the ban and is trying her best to \"expedite clearance\", but if not her, who? The man at the top these days, President Zardari, is well known as a semi-literate (by choice, unlike the bulk of the country) who has probably never read a whole book in his life. </p> <p>I've received emails from many friends in Pakistan expressing delight: \"what an honour to be banned by Zardari\", \"surely you realise the book will be smuggled in from India\", \"everyone will want to read it now\", etc. My book is being translated into Urdu for publication in November. That edition does not require a clearance, but one can never be too sure in Pakistan. And in case you were wondering, the book is a very sharp critique not just of military dictators, but also of their civilian counterparts, whose corruption knows no bounds.<br><strong>Tariq Ali</strong></p>",
  "<p>My children are enthusiastic about food, it's great when you see them with girlfriends or boyfriends and they talk about food in a knowledgable way. </p> <p>I got them involved in cooking from a very young age, got them stirring, dropping a bit of pancake mixture in the pan, or watching the food cook in the oven, cakes rising, or cheese bubbling up. I just wanted them to feel comfortable in the kitchen. It should be a domain where you feel very much at ease. After all, sitting round a table, sharing your food, that is at the heart of how human beings live. One of the nicest things about taking your kids to a restaurant - Thai or Chinese for example - is having all the dishes in the middle of the table so that you can try a little bit of everything. And I try - not for every meal, but pretty often - to get that feeling at home, to put the food out in serving dishes on the table so that everyone can help themselves, because I think that's what makes children feel comfortable. </p> <p>I get loads of letters from desperate parents whose kids won't eat this and that, and I always say, just give it time, think back to what you were like as a kid. I've got one friend, I've known him since we were boys, and he gets furious when his kids put ketchup all over their dinner, and I had to remind him that as a kid he used to absolutely bury his mum's cooking in ketchup and then mash it into everything. He was like: \"Oh yeah, I'd forgotten about that\". Children's tastebuds are still developing: what they like one week they won't like the next, and the important thing is not to get too upset about it. </p> <p>We do have an obesity problem in this country. I think part of the problem is that some people just can't be bothered and plonk down cheap fatty food in front of their children every night. </p> <p>Planning meals is key: don't just grab something off the shelf, or pick up the first two-for-one offer you see, without some idea of what you're going to do with it. If you buy two heads of broccoli, for example, it will start to yellow very quickly, so you need to make one of those heads into a lovely soup, maybe with some blue cheese or a bit of chorizo, straightaway which you can freeze and have another day.</p> <p>My family is now in a slightly awkward phase, we quite often seem to have meals at different times because, for example, my son Jimmy is off playing golf or footie, or my daughter Maddy is just hanging out with her friends. There's no doubt that Clare, my wife, would like us to eat together every day, but we usually only manage it a couple of times a week. </p> <p>It's all really about spending some time with them. Cooking is about love, really, and cooking for your children is all about caring for them, building relationships. If you can't cook every day, perhaps you can have a couple of cooking days a week, where you make some fresh food and freeze portions of it for the other days. In our house caring about food is pretty instinctive. Of course I'm off travelling a lot, but when I'm home then we'll say, all right, let's make muffins, let's make gingerbread, lets just make some time in these hectic lifestyles to be together in the kitchen. </p> <p>And it's worth it. When I see my boy making scrambled eggs - he makes wicked scrambled eggs, tipping the pan to check their consistency - I get a feeling: that's what I've done. It's what it's all about. </p> <p>\u2022 A new series of Ready Steady Cook will begin later this autumn</p>",
  "<h2>Crew 'were not warned of flaw in Hercules aircraft'</h2> <p>The RAF officer who headed an inquiry into the shooting down of a Hercules plane in Iraq with the loss of 10 lives expressed anger yesterday that crews had not been warned about a key weak point on the aircraft. Wing Commander John Reid, a former Hercules squadron commander, said the plane would not have been flying so low had warnings about its vulnerability to small arms fire been passed on to crews. He told he inquest into the deaths at Trowbridge, Wiltshire, that since the tragedy in January 2005 the Hercules had been stopped from flying so low unless absolutely unavoidable.<br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2>Twin toddler dies three days after pond rescue</h2> <p>A twin toddler rescued after falling into a pond with his brother has died after three days on a life support system. George Bostock was found underwater with his brother Harry when much of the Staffordshire village of Tean answered a search appeal by the two-year-olds' parents on Monday evening. The boys somehow found a way out of their gated garden and crossed shrubberies and grassland to the pond. They were resuscitated by a neighbour, 52-year-old Pauline Dalmas, and Harry was later discharged from the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.<br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>Tuba predecessor makes Mendelssohn appearance</h2> <p>A Mendelssohn oratorio at Birmingham's town hall tonight will have as its centre-piece an instrument thought to be the world's only fully functional monstre, or contrabass ophicleide. The 6ft (1.8-metre) brass wind instrument a predecessor of the tuba, has, according to its player tonight, Anthony George, a unique sound - and 11 closed keys that make its playing like \"riding a unicycle through a mudbath\". The instrument is on loan from New York, where George tracked it down, and appears this evening in a revival of the 1846 version of the choral work Elijah. <br><strong>Mark Brown</strong></p> <h2>Palace gardens to open to the public from next year</h2> <p>Buckingham Palace is to open its garden gates to tour groups for the first time next year, it was announced yesterday. For more than 200 years the public has only been allowed to glimpse the 16-hectare (39-acre) garden if invited to official events. Now groups of up to 25 people will be able to book a tour of London's largest private garden on selected dates in April, May and June for \u00a320 a head. The tours are one of the palace's seasonal initiatives to open up different parts of the Queen's residence to the public. It is still to be decided whether they will continue after next summer. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Exhibition marks 50 years of Blue Peter</h2> <p>Film clips, scripts and strange objects made by presenters of the children's TV show Blue Peter go on display in Bradford today at an exhibition marking 50 years of the programme. Borrowing the show's most famous catchphrase, the Here's One We Made Earlier exhibition at the National Media Museum includes the original Blue Peter version of the Thunderbirds' Tracy Island and young viewers' designs for roof bosses which were installed in York Minster after the 1984 fire.

Reviews and blog postings have poured scorn on the two-night appearance at the Echo Arena in Liverpool, which is this year's European Capital of Culture. Comments from disappointed fans included: \"I would rather jump on plug sockets with angry wasps in my mouth than listen to that dross again.\" Scores of others denounced the celebrity evening, with tickets at almost \u00a370 for two, as a waste of money. <br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>Couple forced to pull plug on Christmas display</h2> <p>A couple who for 20 years have lit their home with 50,000 brightly coloured lights every Christmas have pulled the plug on the extravagant display because of soaring electricity prices and the cost of carrying out a health and safety check. Bernard and Denise Lumsden's electricity bill for six months last year was \u00a31,200, largely because of their festive display in Brislington, Bristol. A safety bill of \u00a3300 needed to test every light, decoration and even the kettle was the last straw. Mr Lumsden, 58, a retired lorry driver, said: \"We are both so sad and choked up about it. Just talking about it is upsetting.\" <br><strong>Steven Morris</strong></p>",
  "<p>My eyesight is going, so I have a hideously magnified mirror with an in-built light that shows every pore and cranny. I get a shock when I start putting on make-up and see the moonscape in front of me. I constantly check between an ordinary mirror and the magnifying mirror to see what I look like at a normal distance. </p> <p>I'm lucky with my hair. Seven years ago it started to thin, but then it stopped and, at 48, I'm past the danger zone. I've never dyed it. If I start to go that horrible, Michael Heseltine tobacco-stained shade, I'll dye it white. When blonds go grey, it can look as if they smoke a lot. </p> <p>Transvestites are good at conning themselves about what they see in the mirror. You are used to seeing yourself as a man, so when you put on make-up and a wig, you see only additions. It's easy to persuade yourself that you're looking glamorous and feminine. When you meet other transvestites, you see the whole package come through the door with the wonky wig and the lunar landscape make-up, and you think, \"Oh my God, that's what I look like!\" </p> <p>I have several styles of [my alter ego] Claire - the little girl is probably best known. I also have fetish clothes. I work with students at St Martins and they make me weird and wonderful outfits. I wear them to parties and openings, or to the shops if I am in the mood. </p> <p>Over the summer, I might not have any occasion to get dressed up - heat is the enemy of drag, as Boy George once said. If I've a long period of abstinence, I grow a beard. It's a novelty and makes my face look interesting.</p>",
  "<p>Kindling fire was one of the turning points of human evolution, right up there with learning how to put it out. Fire was vitally important to early man because it gave warmth for heating and cooking, light for protection and homework, and charcoal for cave paintings and barbecues. </p> <p>According to the Ancient Greeks, Prometheus was the man who first stole fire from the gods. Mankind was then punished for this theft by being sent woman for the first time in the shape of Pandora. This says something very significant about either fire or women or the Ancient Greeks. </p> <p>One of the secret attractions of cigarettes is the fact that they burn. They wouldn't be half so attractive if you had to take nicotine via a suppository. The fact that you have to light up is in itself comforting, because you are in effect standing round your own one-person campfire. Pipes have an even more comforting effect because it's like building your own bonfire and setting light to it. </p> <p>Firefighters have an almost mythic status in society because they tackle the uncontrolled forces of nature. It's the same with lifeboat crews. If traffic wardens also dealt with tornadoes and flooding, they might enhance their status. </p> <p>Fire often gets a bad press, possibly because it can destroy cities in one big night out. On the other hand, there's nothing nicer than sitting round a roaring log fire on a cold winter's night. The trick is to make sure the latter doesn't become the former. Fire is like a naughty child: quite cute to begin with, but liable to get out of hand if not kept well under control. </p> <p>It is possible to burn without a flame. For example, you can burn with desire. You can also burn with a fever. These two are remarkably similar in that both make you feel very hot and slightly delirious. The cure for both is bed and complete rest/passion. </p> <p>Watching flames dance is an elemental and deeply moving experience, and it's no wonder many aboriginal tribes such as the Comanche and the 2nd Faringdon Brownies like to perform sacred rituals around them. Fire can have a purging, cathartic effect, except for a firing squad, which is more permanent and less life-enhancing.</p>",
  "<p>The French government is to take sanctions against one of the country's biggest savings banks, the Caisse d'Epargne, after it suffered a \u20ac600m (\u00a3466.6m) loss on unauthorised equity derivatives trading.</p> <p>The finance minister, Christine Lagarde, yesterday ordered an emergency audit of all French banks after the Caisse indicated that a team of four or five traders had exceeded their limits. </p> <p>They were caught out in the panic surrounding last week's stock market crash by what the bank called \"routine control procedures\". The positions were immediately closed, the Caisse said. The traders had been disciplined.</p> <p>Lagarde said she was \"particularly frustrated and depressed\" by this latest incident of unauthorised trading to hit French banks as the country's banking commission began an investigation into the incident.</p> <p>The Caisse, which is merging with Banque Populaire to form France's second largest retail bank and is known as \"the Squirrel\", is the third to be stung by losses caused by rogue traders.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale took a \u20ac4.9bn hit on up to \u20ac50bn of futures positions allegedly run up by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, while Cr\u00e9dit Agricole last year lost \u20ac250m through a rogue trader based in the US.</p> <p>Lagarde said the government had been informed of the Caisse losses late on Thursday. Ministers had then been steering legislation through parliament to set up the bank refinancing company which has up to \u20ac320bn to guarantee bank loans. It is the latest European government to follow the British lead in bailing out banks in the wake of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Lagarde's comments came after she attended the first meeting of the refinancing company, which is chaired by former IMF managing director Michel Camdessus. France has also set aside \u20ac40bn of capital to inject into any ailing banks but has repeatedly insisted its banks are \"sound and robust\". The Caisse, which was already closing its proprietary trading desk, earlier this month denied reports that it was seeking a \u20ac6.5bn capital injection to offset huge trading losses. </p> <p>In a statement it said: \"In view of the size of its capital base - more than \u20ac20bn - and its substantial liquidity, this loss has no effect on the financial strength of the group.\"</p> <p>It is understood that an assistant of the rogue traders' team leader has been dismissed. Others have been moved to different jobs.</p> <p>The French rogue trading came to light as Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, ordered a regulatory crackdown on parts of the opaque $600 trillion (\u00a3346 trillion) derivatives market.</p> <p>Gordon Brown earlier this week urged global action to control the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading market which accounts for the vast majority of the total market and takes place between two parties off-exchange, largely to limit foreign exchange or interest rate risks.</p> <p>McCreevy, pointing to the surge in credit default swaps (CDS), said the OTC market could cause \"new tremors\" in the fragile market conditions if one of the parties could not meet its liabilities.</p> <p>He indicated that there should be a central clearing house for \"standardised\" derivatives and he could table EU legislation along these lines before the end of the year. </p> <p>\"No one is able to say how these swaps [CDS] will unwind. Regulators have little sight of the potential liabilities that could be building up,\" he said.</p> <p>Separately, Deutsche Bank confirmed that its executive board had agreed to waive any multimillion bonuses this year.

  "<h2>How to keep apples</h2> <p>Many apples store well, so don't look on the harvest as a glut. Wrapping will keep them in peak, just-harvested condition. Choose the most perfect, slightly under-ripe ones (no windfalls, they really should be used now), pack into small plastic bags and pierce once. This may sound like a recipe for a bag of mould, but as long as they're stored somewhere evenly cool, such as a shady shed or cellar, condensation will not form and the plastic will prevent shrivelling. This is Apple Weekend, so go to <a href=\"http://www.commonground.org.uk\">commonground.org.uk</a> for local apple-related events, and much, much more.</p> <h2>House plant check-up</h2> <p>There is a silver lining to the descent into fuel poverty: happy house plants. They would far rather be a little cool than surrounded by hot, dry air. Should you, however, manage to trade in the family silver for a few hours' central heating use this winter, consider a houseplant reshuffle. Move them off draughty windowsills above desiccating radiators and into happy little rainforest-like groups, surrounding trays of moist pebbles. You should reduce watering now, but keep misting all winter.</p> <h2>Plant of the week</h2> <p>Delicate snake's head fritillaries are surprisingly tough once established, and will seed themselves and produce their early summer purple, bell-shaped flowers in abundance, given moisture and light shade. Readers can order 25 bulbs for \u00a37.95, or buy three packs (75 bulbs) for \u00a315.90. Prices include UK mainland p&amp;p. To order, call 0870 836 0908 quoting reference GUPW154.

  "<p>\u2022 We knew Jane Beale from <strong>EastEnders</strong> had an especially dark sense of humour from the moment she agreed to a lifetime of Ian. Jane's face may be a permanent fug of strained bewilderment and seething anger, but we know deep inside she's laughing. She's laughing about Ian's raw egg-white skin pallor, his interminable children and her life in a mauve tabard supervising a sausage swimming in lard. Life with Ian is hilarious; that's why Jane has started doing stand-up comedy.</p> <p>Yes, that's where Jane's been sneaking off to. Stand-up comedy lessons! We thought she was having another affair. Actually, we hoped she was having an affair. The poor woman hasn't had a good rattling since 2006 when she was, cough, supervising Grant Mitchell's sausage. Anyway, Jane's first comedy set in a down-market boozer was rather good, drawing heavily from her own experience. OK, it was just Jane holding a microphone slagging off Ian's sexual technique through a PA system. Jane's \"art\" is very confessional, very Tracey Emin in its approach, ie: really rather exciting for everyone involved aside from the one poor bloke clutching his face staring at it going, \"Hang on, that's me she's talking about! My penis looks like a what?\" Ian wasn't supposed to hear Jane's first set; this was her little secret, her chance to regain a bit of control of her life. However, Ian followed her to the pub and now he's bloody livid.</p> <p>\"Give up comedy!\" he quacked angrily, along with lots of other ridiculous stuff, clearly forgetting he was shouting at a woman with a 10-minute open spot at the Bull &amp; Gate next Thursday to fill who was in dire need of material. \"Do I not satisfy you sexually?\" he yelled. \"Yes! Yes! Of course you do!\" shouted Jane, trying to omit the image from her mind's eye of Grant Mitchell's chinos lustfully discarded over the deep fat frier, \"You're the only man for me Ian,\" Jane pleaded, \"that's just a character I'm playing on stage! None of it is true.\" Jane, you're a liar and a terrible one at that.</p> <p>Two people who are completely sexually compatible are Ronnie Mitchell and Jack Branning. They're not an item any more, but they fall into the category of couples who can never ever be left alone in an empty room without merging into one grappling, panting body of unfinished business. They've been at it again this week. Jack is meant to be in love with Tanya (his sister-in-law) right now and they're about to move to France for \"a fresh start\". Crikey, I hope they take a documentary crew with them. We're all crying out for another primetime Channel 4 or BBC2 series about people \"giving it all up\" to \"follow their dream\", before spending 10 tearful weeks in a dilapidated g\u00eete trying to speed read Tricolore Textbook 1, staring blankly at their olive grove and wishing they were back in Britain. It could be called, say, Jack's Olives. Oh let's face it, Jack and Tanya will never get to France anyway. They're just saying it to keep Tanya's kids on their toes. \"Cheer up kiddies,\" Tanya can tell them, \"Uncle Jack is now your daddy, and your real daddy is a shambolic drunk, chucked out for sleeping with Aunty Stacey. And Uncle Brad and Aunty Stacey have split again because she loves Callum off the market and Aunt Suzie seems to be having it off with Peggy Mitchell's fiance Archie who is an OAP, but don't worry, 'cos we're leaving for France on a whim tomorrow. Get those cases packed! Allez allez vite!\"</p> <p>\u2022 In <strong>Coronation Street</strong>, Tony, Carla's fiance, has murdered Liam. What a relief. Carla and Liam had ample chance to get together, but they completely blew it. Meanwhile, John Stape appears to have kidnapped Rosie and is holding her at his dead gran's house. It's all a bit Silence Of The Lambs. \"I need to go and, ahem, feed Gran's cat,\" John keeps claiming. I wish I was more worried about Rosie rather than just curious (and slightly amused) as to what he's done with her. This is the trouble with being horrid and self-serving; there's a distinct dearth of people available to cry on Sky News when you don't make it home for tea. \"Eeeeh, I wish she'd ring or summat,\" sighed Sophie Webster, half-heartedly, \"she's well doing me'ead in.\" Sophie is becoming one of the stars of the show right now. She's so lovable and backchatty. Sophie's role has always been as the invisible Webster. She's incredibly wise and loyal but no one listens to a word she ever says, aside from Rita (who, incidentally, is looking hotter and more glam now than she did in 1998. That woman has a good hair colourist). </p> <p>\u2022 Over in <strong>Emmerdale</strong>, Andy Sugden took an overdose this week after his secret \"hobby\" of beating up girlfriend Jo was discovered by the village. Andy sat defiantly at the kitchen table with a bottle of tequila when Diane turned up for a strong word with him, putting pills into his mouth one by one. \"You'll need to do it faster than that,\" sighed Diane, \"or it will just be slower and more painful.\" Andy is still alive, by the way. And Diane's application to the Samaritans for Christmas shifts is still very much \"pending\".<br><a href=\"mailto:worldoflather@hotmail.com\"><br>worldoflather@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Around 30 million shoppers will buy at least some of their Christmas presents online this year - that's twice as many as five years ago. The amount we spend has also been rising dramatically. During November and December last year, it topped \u00a310.7bn, up 62% on the \u00a36.6bn over the same period in 2006.</p> <p>Nobody is yet ready to predict what this crisis hit year's Christmas e-commerce spend will be, though IMRG, the body for the e-retail industry, does expect another rise. \"If really pushed, we'd probably say it'll be up around 15%, but that's very, very much conjecture,\" it says.</p> <p>But while millions have cottoned on to the convenience of online shopping - being able to do it any time of day or night, often at better prices, without the hassle of trailing through crowds and lugging heavy bags home - are we equally savvy about safety?</p> <p>Fraud losses from \"card-not-present\" fraud - where criminals get hold of people's card details and use them to buy goods online, over the phone and by mail order, are still rising rapidly year on year, according to the UK bank payments association Apacs. </p> <p>The good news, of sorts, is that online fraud is decreasing as a percentage of all card-not-present fraud. But it is still going up in value terms - losses hit \u00a396.9m in the first six months of this year. To that end, Apacs will be launching an advertising campaign from Monday, Be Card Smart Online, along with a dedicated website, <a href=\"http://www.becardsmart.org.uk\">becardsmart.org.uk</a> to raise consumer awareness.</p> <p><strong>Here are some of the key tips:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Keep your PC protected by ensuring you have the latest operating system, browser and up-to-date anti-virus software. </p> <p>Make sure your browser is set to the highest level of security notification and monitoring, and check you are using a recent version. Enable automatic system updates or do this manually on a regular basis. And install anti-virus and anti-spyware software - there are free versions available online.</p> <p>\u2022 Shop only on secure sites. Before entering your card details, ensure that the padlock symbol is showing in the bottom right corner of your browser window (don't be fooled by a padlock that appears on the web page itself). The beginning of the web address should change from \"http\" to \"https\" when a connection is secure. </p> <p>Click on the padlock to check that the seller is who they say they are and that their encryption certificate is current and registered to the right address. </p> <p>The address on the certificate should match the primary address in the address bar.</p> <p>\u2022 Look after your passwords. Never disclose them to anyone, write them down or send them by email. Use different passwords for different services and change them regularly. Avoid \"weak\" passwords that are easy for fraudsters to work out, such as your partner's name or your favourite football team. The most commonly used is \"password\", so avoid that one.</p> <p>\u2022 Deal only with reputable sellers and know who you are dealing with. Get the seller's phone number (not a mobile) and postal address (not a post office box number).</p> <p>\u2022 Always print out and keep a hard copy of your order form, confirmation email and the retailer's terms and conditions as proof for your card issuer should problems arise. Be wary when buying from overseas companies - it may be more difficult to seek redress if problems arise.</p> <p>\u2022 Register your credit and debit cards with Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode when prompted, or contact your card issuer direct to sign up. </p> <p>These schemes allow you to authenticate your identity when shopping online at participating merchants, through the use of a private password. By signing up, you prevent fraudsters from using your card details on participating sites, as they won't know your password.

  "<p>It has variously been described as the demise of capitalism, the end of modern banking or the day we stopped trusting our financial institutions. Whatever your view of this week's unprecedented \u00a337bn part-nationalisation of three of Britain's biggest banks, one thing is clear - it's time to take back control of your finances.</p> <p>Millions of us have entrusted Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS (owner of the Halifax) and Lloyds TSB with our money, but - to put it bluntly - they ballsed it up. We as taxpayers must now bail them out, and five of the bosses are paying the price.</p> <p>It is more important than ever to be on top of where your money is, and to ensure it is working as hard as it can. That does not necessarily have to be an onerous task. It might just mean spending a little more time going through your paperwork, making sure your savings are in the right place, that the mortgage is still appropriate for your circumstances, and that your pension arrangements stand some chance of being worth something when it is gold-watch time. Remember financial companies rely on customer inertia.</p> <p><strong>Savings</strong> The events of recent weeks underline the importance of knowing exactly where your savings cash is: which bank, building society or financial services provider is looking after it? Are they a stand-alone player or an offshoot? Who owns them? Is the parent company based in this country or overseas? What are the compensation arrangements, should it go belly-up?</p> <p>A lot has been happening in the world of depositors' compensation schemes lately - the UK scheme saw its maximum payout hiked to \u00a350,000, and now there is a proposal to up it to \u20ac100,000 (\u00a378,000) - and it is vital to stay on top of what is happening.</p> <p>The \"glass-half-full\" way of looking at this week's part-nationalisations is that, while arguably bad news for taxpayers, it is good news for savers, as it is impossible to imagine any of these banks being allowed to fail.</p> <p>Some people will probably feel that if the financial meltdown has taught them anything, it is that savings that are easily accessed on their local high street are worth more than those held in an account halfway around the world.</p> <p>Obviously you don't want to find yourself relying on a Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which could take months to return your money if your bank bites the dust.</p> <p><strong>Mortgages</strong> Many homeowners who have been running the same mortgage for several years are probably thanking their lucky stars that they are not having to try and find a new deal now. But that doesn't mean you should simply sit back and do nothing.</p> <p>Do you know what sort of mortgage you are on? With some experts claiming the Bank of England base rate could fall as low as 2% next year, those with tracker deals may well be happy. If you are on your bank or building society's standard variable rate (SVR) check whether your lender has passed on the full 0.5% interest-rate cut. The Halifax has, but several others have not. Nationwide this week announced a 0.3% cut, while the government-owned Northern Rock said it would cut its SVR by just 0.15% from November 1.</p> <p>If your mortgage is \"interest-only\", you can no longer count on rising house prices to repay the loan. This week saw claims that the average price of a house in the UK will not return to its 2007 peak until 2023. If you have an interest-only home loan, and can afford to pay more, then do. If you are able to, move to a repayment basis.</p> <p><strong>Pensions</strong> Millions of people have seen their pension pots hit hard. Most money purchase or \"defined contribution\" plans are based to a large extent on shares. These can be switched into safer havens such as cash or bond funds, but it could be too late.</p> <p>If you are in a company scheme, do you know what your money is being invested in? In many larger workplaces, up to 90% of employees will be in the \"default\" fund, which is often 100% invested in shares, says Damian Stancombe at financial services company Punter Southall. Many workers are unaware that they have choices about where their money is invested. It's time to get the pension documents out and start reading them.</p> <p>For those with decades to go before retirement, riding out the storm could be good advice. When it comes, the upturn could be sudden and swift. Many schemes have \"lifestyle\" plans for those in their last five or 10 years where holdings are gradually moved into less volatile investments.</p> <p>But if you're about to retire and your fund has halved, your best option may be to work longer.</p>",
  "<p>Bank of Scotland - part of HBOS, which is being bailed out by the taxpayer - lent a couple reliant on City bonuses eight times their joint salary to buy a \"dream Sussex farmhouse.\" It agreed a \u00a31.5m mortgage without investigating their earnings, despite monthly repayments almost equalling their combined take-home pay.</p> <p>Peter and Josie Connell - not their real names - are City traders. They could not believe their luck when the bank approved the loan last December. </p> <p>He says: \"We were moving up from a \u00a3750,000 London flat to a \u00a31.75m country home. We needed \u00a31.5m. We asked a broker for help - it was amazing when the bank said yes.\"</p> <p>But the bank admits it did not check the couple's real earnings. A spokesman says: \"Based on the information supplied and the credit score we obtained, we were able to proceed without income verification.\" The credit score showed they had no consumer debt and a credit card with a zero balance. Then, after failing to look at their \u00a3446,000 income, BoS doubled its typical income multiple.</p> <p>Peter says: \"We didn't lie. Last year we had guaranteed bonuses which nearly doubled our income, but this time they will be zero.\"</p> <p>Their mortgage bill was \u00a39,100 a month - leaving them just \u00a31,300 from the combined take-home pay.</p> <p>He says: \"After four months, we had to give up. The bank refused a payment holiday because we admitted we had problems. We had to put the property back on the market. We are victims of irresponsible lending which was unsustainable - the brokers picked up \u00a36,450 for this.\" This week the house was sold, raising enough to repay the bank in full.</p> <p>The bank says: \"This loan was sold via an adviser, so it is the adviser's responsibility to satisfy themselves that the income quoted is correct and can be evidenced.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Think of it as paid practice. Find a narrow passageway with nice acoustics - people can more easily avoid you in wide open spaces.

Check if you need permission from the council. <br><strong>Olwen Williams,</strong> Cambridge</p> <p>\u2022 Teaching in Germany in the 80s (shortly before the collapse of communism), I was enchanted by a Polish trio playing classical music in the square. Along with their personal luggage, cello and other instruments, the three were travelling, living, and sleeping, in a minute Fiat. This (and their music) so touched me, I invited them to stay the night at my place - albeit on the floor - and plied them with chips, baked beans and beverages, and waved them on their way next day.<br><strong>Frederick Robinson,</strong> Bexhill-on-Sea</p> <p>\u2022 If you have the will, the courage and the skill to entertain and earn some cash - go for it. I think people who pass you by might be miserable.<br><strong>Alwynne Cartmell,</strong> Bolton</p> <p>\u2022 I survived the recession of the 80s largely on income from busking in the London Underground. Play what you love and keep trying to play better. London Underground has a licencing scheme for buskers, but they only take on new people once or twice a year. </p> <p>Otherwise, try spots (markets, etc) and hope not to be moved on straight away. The Licensing Act 2003 exempts incidental music from the need for a licence, and most councils consider busking to be incidental. </p> <p>I've observed that poor people give buskers money more often, and in larger amounts, than the rich. If your main concern is money, you'd be better off with any minimum-wage job. </p> <p>If you want to try and understand the fundamental interaction between your music and the people that hear it, busking is ideal.<br><strong>Caroline Kraabel,</strong> by email, who wins this week's \u00a325 National Book Token</p> <p>\u2022 Please remember the local residents.

  "<p>When guide dogs are retired from service, it is common for them to enter a state best described as old-aged adolescence. As they begin to understand that they're no longer responsible for the safety of their owner, the dogs can become almost puppyish, amazed by the unfamiliar freedom of irresponsibility. </p> <p>It's now 12 years since the first ever female, publicly named director general of MI5 retired from duty, and when we meet this week she is unrecognisable from then. The severe-looking woman with the brutally sensible crop and the dry, institutionalised reserve has softened into velvety folds of laughter, and a warmly engaging ease. Stella Rimington has just published her fourth novel, Dead Line, an elegantly pacy thriller starring a female MI5 agent, and at 73 she gives the impression of someone enjoying the novelty of speaking her mind. The effect is not strident so much as touching. Usually when people are being interviewed, you can see them telling themselves not to say too much, but before Rimington answers a question she often seems to be reminding herself that she really can let go. </p> <p>\"Yes, it is a gradual process,\" she agrees, smiling. \"The shades of one's former existence do hang around for quite a long time. It takes a long time to get rid of that. And I still haven't entirely got rid of it.\" </p> <p>She isn't doing badly though. She spoke out against 42-day detention last month, and this week welcomes the government's climb-down unequivocally. \"We shouldn't introduce new intrusions into our civil liberties unless they are absolutely necessary - and nobody had demonstrated that they were necessary. If there isn't any need, then don't move the boundaries.\" She argues that we should \"treat terrorism as a crime, and deal with it under the law - not as something extra, that you have to invent new rules to deal with.\" She is opposed to ID cards, because she can't see how they could be \"a significant counter-terrorist measure\", and although she admits she's \"had more time to think about it since I left the service\", she says her attitude to civil liberties has always been liberal. The big change, she argues, has been not her position, but the politicisation of the issue. </p> <p>\"One of the things I have observed in the last few years, since I left, is that national security has become much more of a political issue. And that parties are tending to use it as a way of trying to get at the other side. You know,\" she adopts a mocking playground tone, \"'We're more tough on terrorism than you are.' I think that's a bad move, quite frankly. </p> <p>\"After the vote in the House of Lords, one heard the home secretary saying something like, 'Well nobody can say I'm not tough on terrorism'. As though the implication was there are people who aren't. Which strikes me as very odd. Because most of the people in the House of Lords whose contributions to that debate I'd read were serious people, who'd possibly spent a life, as I have, trying to protect the country from serious threats. So the implication that, you know, a politician was going to say 'I'm tougher on terrorism than you are' struck me as ... \" and she flicks a wrist, batting away the boast with the back of her hand like a fly. \"And it's happened broadly since 9/11.\"</p> <p>The response to 9/11 was \"a huge overreaction\", she says. \"You know, it was another terrorist incident. It was huge, and horrible, and seemed worse because we all watched it unfold on television. So yes, 9/11 was bigger, but not ... not ...\" Not qualitatively different? \"No. That's not how it struck me. I suppose I'd lived with terrorist events for a good part of my working life, and this was, as far as I was concerned, another one.\"</p> <p>Rimington hopes President Bush's successor will stop using the phrase \"war on terror\". \"It got us off on the wrong foot, because it made people think terrorism was something you could deal with by force of arms primarily. And from that flowed Guant\u00e1namo, and extraordinary rendition, and ...\" And Iraq, I suggest. \"Well yes,\" she says drily. \"Iraq.\"</p> <p>Jacqui Smith gave a speech this week on international terrorism which rather remarkably failed to mention the war in Iraq at all. I ask Rimington what importance she would place on the war, in terms of its impact on the terrorist threat. She pauses for a second, then replies quietly but firmly: \"Look at what those people who've been arrested or have left suicide videos say about their motivation. And most of them, as far as I'm aware, say that the war in Iraq played a significant part in persuading them that this is the right course of action to take. So I think you can't write the war in Iraq out of history. If what we're looking at is groups of disaffected young men born in this country who turn to terrorism, then I think to ignore the effect of the war in Iraq is misleading.\" </p> <p>These might not be unremarkable views for most Guardian readers - of whom Rimington is one. But according to Rimington, they are widely held within the intelligence service - much more so than most members of the public, and perhaps particularly Guardian readers, ever suspect. </p> <p>\"I don't think I'm unusual, frankly. It's the general public's, or whoever's it is, view that's out of date.\" She points out that Baroness Manningham-Buller, another former head of MI5, has been \"saying broadly the same things. I think what that reflects is that the caricature of the service is out of date now. </p> <p>\"People [in the intelligence service] are very conscious of the possibility of intrusions into civil liberties - and therefore the importance of restricting that to the extent of what's strictly necessary. I think people are fully aware that the more you intrude into people's civil liberties, the more you set up grievances for people to, you know, encourage people to do all the unpleasant things that are going on.\"</p> <p>At times the picture Rimington paints of MI5 seems almost too good to be true. She has always said she never carried a gun; none of her agents were ever killed; MI5 does not kill people; it does not spy on the prime minister - not even Harold Wilson - or even vet BBC journalists (even though the BBC has admitted submitting names for vetting). As I run through the list, she anticipates the next question, and grins: \"So what do we do?\" No, I say. My point was going to be that, well, you would say that, wouldn't you? </p> <p>What I mean is that we all know she's not at liberty to tell the whole, unedited truth about her old job - so how can we know how much of her account to trust? She looks hurt, and then insulted. </p> <p>\"Why would I wish to engage in this and tell you a load of garbage? It would be a waste of everyone's time, including my own. Maybe what you ought to be looking at is, are you pursuing a myth about what British intelligence does? Are you still back in the days when people thought that we were like the Stasi? If that's where you're coming from then you shouldn't be surprised when my answer to your questions is no that doesn't happen. Because it doesn't. </p> <p>\"The point I'm making is that if journalists ask me certain questions and get the answer no, could it be that they're asking the wrong questions? You're assuming if you get the answer no, I'm saying we don't do anything - so I must be lying. But the thing is subtle. If the answer's no, it's because the question isn't the right question.\" Has she ever given an untrue answer to a question? \"I'm not in the business of giving untrue answers,\" she says coolly. \"I don't think it's helpful.\" </p> <p>Rimington has herself, though, been on the receiving end of some deliberate unpleasantness from her old service, and admits it shook her. In 2001 she wrote her autobiography, infuriating her former employer - and when she submitted the manuscript for clearance, someone put it in a taxi and sent it to the Sun. Suddenly, she discovered what it felt like to be on the wrong side. I ask if the experience had ever made her reconsider or doubt anything she'd done in office.</p> <p>\"I don't think I doubted anything we'd done,\" she says quickly. \"But - well, I think I maybe did think more about people's reaction to the secret state. When you're in the secret state you are, hopefully, pretty confident of the probity of everything you're doing, and the reason for it. And perhaps you don't think that much about how it looks to people outside. Not that I think you necessarily should be thinking that - because it's not your role. </p> <p>\"But I think I had this sense suddenly that, having been in the heart of it, here I was on the outside submitting this manuscript to the system and I had no control or knowledge of what was going on in that system. And I thought, hmm, I think this must be how people feel when they're dealing with the state machine in many of its manifestations - this Kafka-esque thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the US presidential election reaches a climax against the background of the financial crisis, another silent, dark, time bomb of an issue hangs over the two candidates: torture. For now, there seems to be a shared desire not to delve too deeply into the circumstances in which the Bush administration allowed the US military and the CIA to embrace abusive techniques of interrogation - including waterboarding, in the case of the CIA - which violate the Geneva conventions and the 1984 UN torture convention. </p> <p>The torture issue's cancerous consequences go deep, and will cause headaches for the next president. New evidence has emerged in Congressional inquiries that throw more light on the extent to which early knowledge and approval of the abuse went to the highest levels. What does a country do when compelling evidence shows its leaders have authorised international crimes?</p> <p>For three years I have followed a trail which leads unambiguously to the conclusion that the real bad eggs were not Lyndie England or others on the ground in Abu Ghraib, but the most senior officials in the White House, the Pentagon and the department of justice. Over recent months, Congress has been looking into the role of senior officials involved in the development of interrogation rules. These have attracted relatively scant attention; little by little, however, senators and congressmen have uncovered the outlines of a potentially far-reaching criminal conspiracy. </p> <p>The first hearings were convened before the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives, at the instance of its chairman, Congressman John Conyers, apparently off the back of my book Torture Team. Parallel hearings have been held before the Senate armed services committee. </p> <p>The evidence that has emerged is potentially devastating. It confirms, for instance, that the search for new interrogation techniques for use at Guant\u00e1namo began not with the local military but in the offices of Donald Rumsfeld and his chief lawyer, Jim Haynes. It shows that when the career military expressed objections on legal grounds, Haynes intervened to stop the normal process of review. And it shows a previously unknown interplay between the department of defence and the CIA: a visit to Guant\u00e1namo in September 2002 by the administration's most senior lawyers was followed days later by a senior CIA lawyer, to brief on the new techniques. \"If someone dies while aggressive techniques are being used,\" he explained, \"the backlash of attention would be severely detrimental.\" </p> <p>Last month the Senate armed services committee received new material from Condoleezza Rice, the first cabinet-level official to confirm high-level involvement in discussions on interrogation techniques. \"I participated in a number of meetings in 2002 and 2003 ... at which issues relating to detainees in US custody, including interrogation issues, were discussed,\" she said. Those present at such meetings included Rumsfeld, attorney general John Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Paul Wolfowitz and CIA director George Tenet. The meetings, which concerned the CIA programme, \"occurred inside the White House\". Rice confirmed she was aware of the existence of, but did not read, the justice department legal advice of August 1 2002 that abandoned the international definition of torture and replaced it with a definition drawn from a US Medicare statute. </p> <p>Buried away in this testimony lies the most dangerous material of all: evidence which may establish that abuses on detainees in Iraq in September 2003, in the period perhaps including the events at Abu Ghraib, were the result of decisions taken at the highest levels of the administration. The administration has long proclaimed it did not allow aggressive interrogations in Iraq, since the Geneva conventions applied. Last month we learned this was false: not everyone had protection under Geneva. If you were considered to be a terrorist, you had no protection at all. A senior US intelligence officer visited Iraq in September 2003. He witnessed abusive interrogation techniques that violated Geneva and complained. The response? He was told the techniques \"were pre-approved by DoD GC or higher\". DoD GC is the general counsel at the department of defence, Jim Haynes. Who could be higher? His boss: Rumsfeld.</p> <p>I have testified before Congress on these issues, and have been asked if there should be criminal investigations and prosecutions. At the very least, the next US president must ensure the full facts are established. It will then be for others to decide what follows. But if the US doesn't get its own house in order and restore its reputation for the rule of law, others will surely step in. </p> <p>\u2022 Philippe Sands QC is professor of law at UCL, a barrister at Matrix Chambers and author of Torture Team <a href=\"http://mailto:p.sands@ucl.ac.uk\">p.sands@ucl.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<h2>Stringy stretchy omelettes</h2> <p>Eggs are obviously sent from heaven for tired parents. Omelettes make great quick dinners, and you can just bung whatever you've got in the fridge into them: peas, ham, onion, mushrooms. Gouda is particularly popular, as it goes stringy when it melts. For some reason, there is nothing as funny, in the whole world, as stringy cheese.</p> <p>According to Elizabeth David, there is one important rule for omelettes : they are the opposite of scrambled eggs in that you cook as fast as humanly possible. In other words, make sure the pan is scalding before you tip in the egg mixture. For cheese omelettes, mix a bit of the cheese into the egg and then tip the rest of the cheese into the centre once the eggs are nearly cooked . For mushroom omelettes, cook the mushrooms in the pan and take them out before you mak e the omelette. Similarly it's worth warming frozen peas through quickly.</p> <h2>Pancakes</h2> <p>You can buy ready-made pancake mix in the shop, or make it yourself. Children love the drama of the whole flipping thing so much, it's quite ridiculous: pancakes for dinner always does feel like a special occasion. Cook up some spinach and stir in some creme fraiche, cheese and salt for a really delicious savoury filling.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>110g plain flour<br>Pinch of salt<br>2 large eggs<br>200ml milk mixed with 75ml water<br>2 tbsp melted butter</p> <p>Sift the flour and water into a mixing bowl, then make a well in the middle and drop the eggs in. Whisk them gently, drawing the flour in as you do so . Start slowly adding the milk/water until it has all been poured in. Whisk until the batter is smooth. Get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down, melt a bit of butter and pour in a ladleful of batter. Flip over when you see bubbles in the batter, and after a few seconds, take out and serve.</p> <h2>Quick veg pie</h2> <p>You need: frozen puff pastry, a beaten egg, some grated cheese and whatever vegetables you have in the fridge. This works particularly well with leeks, broccoli, mushrooms, courgettes. Slice the veg and cook in a bit of melted butter over a very low heat . Then tip out on to one half of the opened out pastry. Sprinkle with grated cheese , paint egg around the edge of the pastry and then fold it over. Paint more egg all over the top and gently snip holes in the pastry to allow it to breath. Cook for 30 minutes at 200C (400F, gas mark 6). </p> <h2>Fajitas</h2> <p>Children love DIY food, and nowhere is it done better than Mexico.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>Flour tortillas<br>Olive oil <br>Onion <br>Mushrooms and garlic (all chopped finely) <br>Red pepper and chicken sliced into long strips <br>Cumin<br>75ml of chicken or veg stock<br>Red peppers<br>Grated cheese<br>Baked beans<br>Slices of avocado<br>Shredded lettuce<br>Tomato sauce.</p> <p>Soften the onions in olive oil, add the mushrooms and then the garlic, then chuck in the red pepper, the chicken and the cumin and fry for a few minutes. Drop the chicken and increase the mushrooms for a delicious vegetarian version. Then add the stock and let it simmer while you heat the baked beans through.</p> <p>If you've got a gas hob the quickest and most tasty way to heat the tortillas is to put them directly on the flame: turn them quickly with tongs or two forks until they're crispy. A bit of blackening just adds to the smoky flavour. Then just let the kids pile what they like in: the joy of making their own dinner often tempts them into adding all sorts of things they wouldn't normally touch.</p> <p>Tip for folding: line the ingredients down from top along the centre, then fold a flap of tortilla up from the bottom. Then wrap the sides over: this stops everything falling out.</p> <h2>Homemade pizza</h2> <p>Pizza is the greatest. And children love making their own - all you need is a base, some kind of sauce and the topping of your choice \u2026</p> <p>There are several techniques, of varying quickness. Quickest of all is to use the readymade bases they sell in the supermarkets (you can also use those flour tortillas which make lovely small crispy pizzas, perfect for everyone to make their own).</p> <p>Or, best of all, you can make the bases from scratch. This involves a lot more time at some point but then you have them in your freezer and just whip them out when needed.</p> <p><strong>Possible toppings<br></strong>Tomato sauce or ketchup<br>Mozzarella and/or cheddar<br>cheese <br>Mushrooms and ham <br>Olives and tuna <br>Peppers from a jar <br>Salmon and creme fraiche</p> <h2>Pasta bake</h2> <p>You can put any old leftovers into this: it's a kind of dustbin of a dinner, except that makes it sound unappetising. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Pasta<br>1 large tbsp flour<br>2 tbsp butter<br>2-3 large handfuls grated cheese (cheddar, parmesan \u2014 you can mix up what you've got)<br>275ml milk<br>Vegetables - courgettes, cabbage, spring onions, beans, peas, carrots, asparagus - whatever you have to hand<br>Breadcrumbs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190 C (375F, gas mark 5). Cook the pasta and drain . Put the pasta and veg into a baking dish together. Make the cheese sauce: melt the butter with the flour and stir until it forms a paste then slowly stir in the milk (this is slightly easier if the milk is already a little warm), letting it thicken as you do so. Once all the milk is in, take it off the heat and put in half the cheese. Pour it over the pasta and veg, and scatter the rest of the cheese with some breadcrumbs on top. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.</p> <h2>Sausage and beans</h2> <p>Tell them this is what cowboys have for dinner. Children really seem to fall for that stuff.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Olive oil<br>Sausages ( 2 per child)<br>1 onion (finely chopped)<br>1 400g can cannellini beans<br>1 400g can tomatoes<br>1 tbsp black treacle or golden<br>syrup or dark brown sugar <br>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce </p> <p>Fry the sausages in the oil in a heavy-based frying pan, then take them out while you cook the onions in the sausage juice until they're golden. Add the beans (rinsed), tomatoes, treacle/syrup/sugar, the Worcestershire sauce and 150ml boiling water. Cook for a few minutes and then put in the sausages and bring to one glorious crescendo!</p> <h2>Beans and pesto</h2> <p>Canned beans are a great base for a quick meal. Adapt some of the pasta sauces to stir in with them, such as that old favourite - pesto and potatoes.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>2 medium potatoes (peeled and diced)<br>2 tins of your favourite beans (perhaps not kidney)<br>A bit less than half of one jar of ready-made pesto, or some of your home-made<br>50g butter<br>1 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>Cook the potatoes and about five minutes before they are done, add the beans, washed of all their tinny juices. Drain and put veg aside. Put the pan back on the heat, mix the butter, olive oil and pesto until it all sizzles, then gently tip back the beans and potatoes and give a stir. Serve up with grated cheese.</p> <h2>Fried fish</h2> <p>We often forget what fast food fish can be, and a fried fillet of white fish - cod, haddock, plaice - is the simplest, quickest way to get it into your children. Just pat both sides of the fish with flour, put some butter in a pan and put the fish in: it takes between five and 10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillet. You can check by gently pulling it apart: if all the translucency is gone it's done.</p> <h2>Chicken drumsticks</h2> <p>The nicest way to cook drumsticks is to make up a mix of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and tomato ketchup, plus whatever else you have to hand, and then roll the m in it and stick them into a pan and into the oven for half an hour. You'll need to turn them occasionally.</p> <h2>Lamb keema </h2> <p>This is a really easy way to introduce your child to very mild curry flavours.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>1 tbsp veg oil<br>1 onion<br>2 garlic cloves<br>500g minced lamb<br>1 400g tin tomatoes<br>1/2 tsp mild chilli powder<br>1/2 tsp cumin<br>1 tsp ground coriander seeds<br>1 tsp turmeric<br>200ml coconut milk</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large heavybased saucepan, then put in the onion and cook it quickly, stirring to make sure it doesn't catch, unti l it's translucent. Add the garlic and stir. Put in the mince and stir until it browns. Add the spices, then the tomatoes and coconut milk . Simmer for half an hour, then serve with rice.</p> <h2>Vegetable curry</h2> <p>Incredibly easy, and brilliant way of finishing off the veg in the fridge. Use whatever's to hand, there are very few vegetables that don't thrive in this dish.</p> <p><strong>You need<br></strong>Vegetable oil<br>1 onion or 2 shallots<br>1 garlic clove<br>1 small celeriac<br>2 tbsp mild curry paste<br>A few cardamom pods<br>Assorted vegetables (red or green peppers, potato, sweet potato, pumpkin, cauliflower, courgette, broccoli, green beans, peas, okra - what ever you've got in the fridge \u2026)<br>250 ml greek yoghurt</p> <p>Heat the oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic and pepper if you're using any. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celeriac and some salt and pepper . Give it a couple of minutes, then add the curry paste, the cardamom and some of your vegetables (you have to use your judgment here: the more solid veg should go in first, while the veg which have more affinity with water and which will just mush away if they're cooked too long go in later, after you've got the whole thing properly bubbling). Stir again and let the vegetables sweat in the curry paste a little, then tip in the tomatoes, add a can full of water, and bring it all the boil. After that add the quickcookers and give the whole thing about 10 minutes, until the veg are tender.</p> <p>Serve with rice, plain yoghurt, and naan heated through. You could also make some lass i : just pour some plain yoghurt into a blender, along with a good splash of milk, a pinch of ground cardamom and cinnamon. Sweeten to taste with caster sugar . You can add fruit too - mango or banana are particularly lovely.</p>",
  "<h2>Make this with your kids: Bread</h2> <p>It takes longer than a bread machine, but the smell of proving dough is just joyful. </p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>21g dried yeast (3 x 7g sachets) or 30g fresh yeast<br>30g honey<br>625ml tepid water<br>1 kilo strong flour<br>30g salt</p> <p>Dissolve the yeast and honey in half the tepid water. In a large bowl, or on a flat surface, make a mound with the sifted flour and salt, and make a well in the middle, then pour the yeast-honey mix in and, either with your fingers or with a plastic spatula, start to mix them (you can do this part in a mixer too, very slowly and gently). </p> <p>Once the first portion is mixed in, add the second portion of water. By now you should have a fairly moist ball of dough which you can then knead for five to 10 minutes. Then put it in a baking tray, cover it with clingfilm or a cloth, and leave it somewhere warm for at least half an hour, probably more, until your ball of dough has doubled in size. </p> <p>Now knead it again, back down to size. Then make up your mind what you want to do with it. If you want to make bread rolls, preheat the oven to 225C (435F, gas mark 7), divide into a dozen balls, leave them to prove again (ie double in size again), and bake them for 10-15 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty rating</strong></p> <p>Quite high. There's a tricky stage with the dough just after you've combined the ingredients and before it's turned into a lovely ball of dough where an adult may need to step in to check that the texture is right. It's also quite a long process.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong></p> <p>Yes, yes, yes. Paige rated this one of her favourite dishes, and we tore into the bread rolls with gusto. Kneading the dough was fantastically popular: it was the best kneaded dough of all time, as everyone wanted to have a go. Asa's verdict: \"I love bread\". </p> <h2>Pizza bases </h2> <p>If you want to make pizza bases, follow the recipe for basic bread and then, instead of proving it for a second time, divide the dough into four and roll each ball out into a pizza circle. Stretch the dough as far as you possibly can because the thinner you get it the better. </p> <p>If you want to use one of your bases straight away, put it onto a baking tray, load up with ingredients as you wish, and cook, as hot as you can get the oven. If you want to freeze the others, give them five minutes each in the oven and then put in the freezer: you can cook them straight out of the freezer and they're so good.</p> <h2>Nigella's easy buttermilk cake</h2> <p>This cake is ideal for any birthday cake you want to make in a special mould - it holds its shape brilliantly.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>250g plain flour<br>1 \u00bd tsp baking powder<br>\u00bd tsp bicarb of soda<br>\u00bd tsp salt<br>200ml buttermilk (or 75g yoghurt mixed with 125ml semi-skinned milk)<br>1\u00bd tsps vanilla essence<br>125g soft butter<br>200g caster sugar<br>3 large eggs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4), and line a 23cm square cake tin. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb and salt together. Pour the buttermilk (or yogurt mix) into a measuring jug and add in the vanilla. Cream the butter and sugar together, and then add the eggs one at a time. Then add a bit of the flour and then a bit of the buttermilk, one after the other, until it's all mixed in together. Pour into the tin and bake for 40 minutes.</p> <h2>Fairy cakes</h2> <p>These cakes are really easy to make from scratch, and taste a million times better than those ready-made batches which are so weirdly synthetic.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>125g self-raising flour<br>125g soft butter<br>125g caster sugar<br>1 tsp baking powder<br>2 eggs<br>1 tsp vanilla essence</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C (375F, gas mark 5) and put cake cases into a bun tin: this usually makes about 20 or so. Sift the flour and baking powder together, and then pour everything else in and beat until it's creamy: when it drops off the spoon with a fat dollop, the mix is ready. Put a spoonful of mix into each case and bake for about 20 minutes. Children love icing these, so if you're feeling indulgent make up some batches of icing for them and put out a selection of silver balls, hundreds and thousands, smarties and chocolate buttons. It's a cheap way to be the most popular parent for at least half an hour.</p> <h2>Nigella's jam doughnut muffins</h2> <p>Sticky fingers, sticky everything, these are an indulgent treat.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>125ml milk<br>85ml corn or other veg oil<br>1 large egg<br>\u00bd tsp of vanilla extract<br>200g self-raising flour<br>100g caster sugar<br>12 tsps strawberry jam<br>100 unsalted butter<br>150g granulated sugar</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C (375F, gas mark 5), and oil a muffin tin to within an inch of its life. Then beat together the milk, oil, egg and vanilla extract and very, very gently fold the mixture into the flour and caster sugar. Nigella says you don't need to worry about lumps: \"If you overbeat, the muffins will be tough\". Put a spoonful of mixture into each cup and then a teaspoonful of jam, and then another spoonful of mix. Put into the oven and cook for about 20 minutes until gloriously risen. Then (this is where it starts to slip into farcical levels of Nigella-ness) melt some butter and put the granulated sugar onto a plate. Roll the muffins in the butter and then in the sugar. Absurd but delicious.</p> <h2>Marmalade buns</h2> <p>Fragrant little cakes from Jane Brocket's mouth-watering book Cherry Cake and Ginger Beer.</p> <p><strong>For the dough</strong><br>175g butter<br>175g soft brown sugar<br>3 eggs<br>Grated zest of 1 unwaxed orange<br>Juice of \u00bd orange<br>2 large tbsp thin-cut marmalade<br>175g self-raising flour</p> <p><strong>For the icing</strong><br>200g icing sugar<br>Juice of 1 orange</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4). In a mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one by one and mix well. Add the orange zest, orange juice, marmalade and stir. Then gently fold in the flour. Divide the mix between 12 paper cases in a bun tin and bake for about 20 minutes. Leave to cool. Mix the orange juice slowly into the icing sugar until you get the right consistency and ice the cakes.</p> <h2>Cinnamon rolls</h2> <p>A slightly adapted version of Tessa Kiros' cinnamon rolls:</p> <p><strong>For the dough</strong><br>250ml tepid milk<br>100g golden caster sugar<br>3 x 7g sachets dried yeast, or 25g fresh yeast<br>1 egg<br>125g soft butter<br>1 tsp salt<br>650g plain flour</p> <p><strong>For the cinnamon butter</strong><br>2 tsp cinnamon<br>50g golden caster sugar<br>80g soft butter</p> <p>Mix the milk and 100g of the sugar with the yeast: give it 10 minutes to activate. Then add in one of the eggs, the butter and the salt and mix. Sift in the flour, stirring until it begins to hold together, then turn it out onto a floured surface and knead until soft. Put it back into the bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to prove for a couple of hours.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C (355F, gas mark 4). Make the filling by mixing together the cinnamon and the sugar. When risen, roll out the dough and cut into four. Roll out one piece of dough at a time into a nearly square rectangle about 25cm by 30cm, then sprinkle with the cinnamon filling. Roll into a sausage, and cut into fat little V-shapes alternating up and down, and one by one push your fingers right into the middle of the little V so the sides squeeze out a little bit. Bake on a baking tray for about 20 minutes.</p> <h2>Straightforward cake</h2> <p>Given that baking always seems to involve measurements that can tilt out of kilter on a second's dithering, this cake is a relief.</p> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>An equal weight of eggs, butter, sugar, and self-raising flour<br>(start by weighing the eggs in their shells, and then follow on...)<br>Flavouring of your choice<br>(lemon rind, cocoa powder ...)</p> <p>Preheat oven to190C (375F, gas mark 5). Butter a cake tin or get out paper cases if you're going to make baby cakes. Then whip the butter and sugar until fluffy and then add the eggs, one at a time. Finally gently fold in the flour and flavouring, and put the mix into the tin or cases before you slide it into the oven. You'll need about 10-15 minutes for mini-cakes, or just over half an hour for the cake.</p>",
  "<p>Between 1995 and 2002, four young soldiers were discovered dead from gunshot wounds at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. Though the MoD classified the deaths as suicide, the ensuing outcry led to allegations of systematic bullying and an out-of-control binge culture in which the barracks were said to be \"like Saturday night in Glasgow, every night\".</p> <p>The families of those soldiers still await justice after a governmental review closed the lid on the case and insisted there was no need for a full public inquiry. But while media interest in Deepcut has gone cold, theatrical attention has conspicuously heated up. The Sherman theatre in Cardiff commissioned Philip Ralph's verbatim drama Deep Cut, which aroused much attention at this year's Edinburgh festival. Now, writer Fiona Evans has dramatised the experience of the Gray family, whose son Geoff died at the barracks in September 2001, and the Collinsons, who lost their son James six months later.</p> <p>Whereas Ralph's play was a straight verbatim account, Evans and director Deborah Bruce take a more adventurous and much riskier approach. The documentary aspect is minimised in favour of dramatic reconstruction, chronologically mixed reports and forays into expressionistic nightmare sequences. Though such chopped logic is indicative of a fractured state of mind, it raises questions about the validity of using real people as dramatic constructs. </p> <p>At least Evans's script has the courage to question itself. At one point a furious heckler stands up to declare that he's a former member of the armed forces and wants to know what the production hopes to achieve \"by bringing all this shit up\". He is a plant, of course: but it is rare to find a campaigning drama brave enough to admit the opposing point of view. </p> <p>There is no question that if Evans's and Ralph's plays increase pressure on the government to open an inquiry, they will have achieved a vital purpose. But the great difficulty, when presented with this type of work, is gauging whether it is more appropriate to respond as a critic, a factual reporter or simply a sympathetic ear. In terms of the piece as a play, I have to express my reservations; in terms of real-life tragedy there is no question that Evans's Deepcut drama cuts very deep indeed.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Capa's 1936 photograph The Falling Soldier shows the moment of a republican soldier's death in the Spanish civil war. Or so it was claimed and widely believed. Then doubts began to circulate. Perhaps the picture was posed, fake. Capa's biographer, Richard Whelan, has gnawed away at this issue for decades. The explanation put forward by him in the catalogue accompanying an exhibition at the Barbican is that, during an informal truce, a group of soldiers simulated a bit of a battle charge for the benefit of the camera. Fearing a genuine attack was being mounted, enemy troops opened fire. The trigger was pulled, the camera clicked simultaneously - and a man died. Make-believe became tragically real.</p> <p>Whelan's explanation is unlikely to be improved on, but it is worth considering something that David Simon, in his book Homicide, learned from ballistics experts: that \"no bullet short of an artillery shell is capable of knocking a human being off his feet\". This is not to say that people don't fall down when shot. They do, but only as \"a learned response. People who have been shot believe they are supposed to fall immediately to the ground, so they do.\"</p> <p>This adds an unexpected twist to the moment of simulation, but there is a larger irony too: the more one learns about the circumstances in which Capa made his famous photograph, the less those circumstances matter. Even if it is now established that this is what happened, it is too late. Over the years, the photograph has come adrift from those circumstances, floated clear of what it depicts. One of the standard ideas about photography is that it is strong as evidence, weak in meaning. The Falling Soldier shows this formulation in reverse: it has become more and more questionable as evidence, but its meaning has continued to deepen. Somehow the image is able to accommodate all the different accounts of its making, accounts that have themselves assumed the quality of after-the-fact interpretation. Ultimately, the only proof it offers is of something that has long been accepted - that photographs can be as mysterious as works of art. </p> <p>Capa said that he would rather have \"a strong image that is technically bad than vice versa\". He realised early on that a little camera-shake created a dangerous air of bullets whirring overhead. In certain circumstances, then, technical imperfection could be a source of visual strength. When his pictures of the D-day landings were published in Life magazine, a caption explained that the \"immense excitement of the moment made Capa move his camera\". The blurring actually came later, as a result of a printing error at the lab in London. In the excitement of receiving Capa's films, most of the 72 pictures were completely ruined. Eleven survived, all wounded, maimed, but the darkroom accident imbued them with sea-drenched authenticity and unprecedented immediacy.</p> <p>The relationship between imperfection and authenticity continues to run deep. \"Which is the best camera?\" the old photographers' joke goes. \"The one you have with you.\" The one everyone has with them today is a mobile phone. Geert van Kesteren's pictures in the group show On the Subject of War - also at the Barbican - are all from Baghdad Calling, a collection of mobile-phone images assembled by van Kesteren but taken by people in Iraq, while his first book, Why Mister, Why?, showcased his own photographs from the war-torn country. Why the shift? Partly because it had become too dangerous for him to work there, and partly in acknowledgment of the all-pervasive importance of a gadget used by insurgents to detonate bombs, by refugees as family albums, by citizens as a way of warning each other of danger, by soldiers as mementoes. </p> <p>John Moore won a 2007 World Press Photo award for his picture of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto. Moore was in the jostling crowd. As soon as he heard the gun, just as the suicide bomber detonated himself, he held up his camera and hit autowind, shooting blind. The prizewinning image is a swirl of blurred figures and exploded light. Capa said that if your pictures weren't good enough, that's because you weren't close enough. Get this close to the epicentre of history and your pictures are bound to look pretty bad, as if they're being blown apart. The irrefutable truth of the image - I was there - overrides all aesthetic and technical concerns. This could be seen as falling short of the high art of photojournalism as exemplified by a Magnum luminary such as Philip Jones Griffiths - but it's not as simple as that. \"George Bernard Shaw said he would willingly exchange every single painting of Christ for one snapshot. That's what photography has got going for it,\" Jones Griffiths remarked approvingly.</p> <p>Moore is a professional witness, but similar photos have been taken by lucky survivors or random bystanders. These pictures have the special value suggested by the line from Job, quoted by Melville in the epilogue to Moby-Dick: \"And I only am escaped alone to tell thee.\" Occasionally the person who does the telling is a perpetrator who later confesses that such a thing did in fact take place. I say \"later confesses\", but the words might also be \"immediately boasts\". The Abu Ghraib - or Falluja bridge - photos were the latest manifestation of a practice that thrived in America up until the mid-1930s, of photographing lynchings and sending postcards to friends, to advertise one's enthusiastic involvement. </p> <p>The corollary of this is that, if no photographs exist, then nothing happened. This atrocious logic is memorably expressed by a sergeant in Jarhead, Anthony Swofford's memoir of the first Gulf war. \"Because we are US Marines, and honourable, we do not shoot dead men, we do not carve their skulls open with our E-tools, we don't throw grenades into a pit of corpses, and after we don't do these things, we don't take pictures of the resultant damage.\"</p> <p>Alongside the Capa exhibition is another devoted to Gerda Taro, who died in June 1937, aged 26. Taro and Capa were lovers and collaborators, sometimes working together under the rubric \"Capa &amp; Taro Reportage\". After her death, and due to Capa's increasing fame, Taro gradually faded from photographic history, except as girlfriend of the great war photographer. Through no fault of Capa's, several pictures now known to be by Taro were attributed to him. Leaving the gender politics aside, such confusion is hardly surprising. As Susan Sontag pointed out in the early 1970s, \"the very success of photojournalism lies in the difficulty of distinguishing one superior photographer's work from another's, except insofar as he or she has monopolised a particular subject.\" </p> <p>One of the emblematic images from the Vietnam war shows a severely injured civilian woman lying covered in blood, a soldier crouching over her protectively. It was taken in Saigon in 1969 by Larry Burrows. And by Jones Griffiths. The two photographers were right next to each other, snapping away at the same moment. So these pictures are emblematic less of the Vietnam war than of the way images are gathered and presented. A recent documentary showed a correspondent in close-up, reporting on the latest bloodshed in Iraq. The tight camera added to the intensity of the scene - and, the documentary revealed, hid the fact that, a few feet away, another correspondent was doing his to-camera version of the same story. </p> <p>That we are no longer surprised by this kind of thing - that we have a sophisticated understanding of the concealed grammar of the media - is what makes us so susceptible to the myriad uncertainties of Omer Fast's video installation The Casting, part of the On the Subject of War show. Oral testimony from a soldier who served in Iraq is re-enacted, re-edited and spliced together in such a way as to overload our capacity for distinguishing documentary from delusion. What interests Fast, we hear at the end, is the way that \"Memories become stories ... become mediated\". Or, to enlarge on this slightly, the way that eyewitness snaps - \"I was there\" - start to seem like paintings, or dreams. </p> <p>An-My L\u00ea, whose work is also at the Barbican, is the anti-Capa. She is so far from the action that her photographs are worthless as testimony - and the action isn't really action anyway. She takes pictures of re-enactments and rehearsals, coastal scenes in which the only enemy is a calm, not-very-cruel-looking sea. All of this is recorded with a cumbersome, large-format camera using shutter speeds too slow to capture anything faster than the leisurely movement of tides. </p> <p>And she is not alone in this apparently archaic choice of equipment. Imposing on themselves the kind of limitations faced by Roger Fenton in the Crimea, photographers such as Simon Norfolk have opted to lug their un-mobile technology through war zones, documenting the still residue of conflict. Unable to photograph the Charge of the Light Brigade itself, Fenton documented the cannonball-strewn aftermath of the Valley of Death in 1855. In 2002, in Afghanistan, Paul Seawright came across shell casings lying in a shallow ravine. The resulting photograph is not just reminiscent of Fenton's earlier image, nor is it just a visual essay on an earlier phase of photographic history. Rather, it exhumes Fenton from the past and makes him contemporary. </p> <p>Give or take a few details of uniform, variants in weaponry and modifications to camouflage, images of combat from the latest war often look like new prints made from negatives developed half a century earlier. In Vietnam, Don McCullin encounters his version of a Eugene Smith in Saipan or Iwo Jima. In Iraq, David Turnley or Mike Kamber do versions of Burrows in Vietnam. </p> <p>The content - the injuries, the excitement, the terror - remains essentially the same. But every era tends to be marked by a particular technology. As we have seen, today's anti-standard is represented by the mobile phone. Try imagining footage from Iraq shot with a Zapruder-style home-movie camera. It's impossible. (Will there come a time when digital or mobile phone images appear as memory-drenched as Super 8?) So when, at the Imperial War Museum's In Memoriam exhibition, we see a lush colour photograph of French troops in the first world war camping by a river, we assume it's posed - a re-enactment or a movie still. But it's not. It's genuine. We want to know when the photograph was taken - 1914 - but the larger, stupid-sounding question is: how long ago did the first world war take place?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338723519\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/17/dday460.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Capa's shot of the D-day landings, 1944\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Capa's shot of the D-day landings, 1944. Photograph: International Center of Photography/Cornell Capa/Magnum </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: International Center of Photography/Cornell Capa/Magnum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One answer is provided by the large photograph of Harry Patch, the oldest surviving veteran of the war. By any reckoning he is, at 110, a very old man - proof that the war took place a long time ago, at the furthest reach of living memory. </p> <p>A few yards away from this photograph is a display case containing equipment used by a tank commander, Gordon Hassell. First deployed successfully in the Battle of Cambrai in 1917, the tank was a radical technological innovation, one requiring new, specially designed masks for the crew. Imagine what this mask looks like - a version of a pilot's or motorcyclist's helmet? - and then think again. The top part is solid dark, heavy metal, moulded round the bridge of the nose with slits for the eyes; the bottom half is a kind of chain-mail drape. It looks as if it was made for King Arthur and his knights. In the adjacent case is an even more ancient-seeming exhibit: a club, fashioned from a length of wood, used for hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. </p> <p>These items make the war seem like an event from the archaeological past, a conflict that had more in common with the Battle of Hastings than with today's smart bombs and precision weapons. But this huge vista of martial history also brings the first world war into closer proximity with the present: what, after all, is a mere 90 years in the context of 900? </p> <p>A photo by Henry Tonks shows a Nigerian soldier who has suffered horrible facial injuries in the first world war. Glance quickly at it without consulting the caption and you assume it's one of James Nachtwey's photographs of survivors of the Rwandan genocide (a killing frenzy accomplished, for the most part, with weapons only slightly less primitive than the club). Another photograph shows shell casings piled up like cigarette butts - exactly the kind of thing seen in current images of ecological catastrophe by Simon Norfolk or Edward Burtynsky. </p> <p>This perspective of distant adjacency makes the temporary shows at the Imperial War Museum and the Barbican seem like twinned halves of an ongoing, permanent exhibition.</p> <p>At the entrance to the In Memoriam exhibition is a display of three items: a steel helmet, a section of barbed wire and a commemorative poppy from the 1920s. The helmet was found near the body of a Canadian soldier in June of this year. In this way, the past keeps rising to the surface of the present. Looking like a corroded relic of the iron age, the helmet is fragile, flaking, earthy. In the long term, it seems, everything is biodegradable. Given time, even metal becomes a form of compost. Proximity suggests that eventually the helmet will turn into - or, at the very least, fertilise - the poppy lying next to it. </p> <p>The strip of barbed wire is about six inches long - short enough to imply that something which once existed in limitless abundance is now a rare and precious commodity. Though encrusted with rust, it looks vaguely decorative, as if it might be a fragment of the earliest surviving necklace. Notions of progress tend to be overly utilitarian. The emphasis on the discovery of new tools (the spear, the axe), of getting things done faster, more efficiently, downplays the importance men and women have always attached to adornment. Maybe that impulse is, as it were, stitched into our DNA. And that's what this twisted strip of rusty wire looks like: a petrified strand of DNA, evidence that the desire to make war is encoded in the very essence of our being. </p> <p>Not that these two urges - to adorn and destroy - are entirely distinct. Think back to War and Peace, and how the former pervades every aspect of the latter. When the cavalry officers are not charging into battle they're sweeping across ballrooms in shining boots and jangling spurs, bejewelled women blushing in their arms. Or think of Sergeant Troy in Far from the Madding Crowd, bewitching Bathsheba with his dazzling swordplay. Nowadays there is a strict division between the military drab of combat fatigues and the bright tunics of ceremonial function but, as that colour photograph of French troops reminds us, in 1914 soldiers still wore uniforms designed to make them stand out against - rather than blend in with - their surroundings. And it is not for nothing that the bravest, most heroic fighting men are called the most decorated</p> <p>\"It makes no difference what men think of war,\" declares the judge in Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. \"War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him ... That is the way it was and will be.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This Is War!

But if they come here, they would be surprised to see that a man as well can do the same thing.\"</p> <h2>Liberia</h2> <p><strong>Johnette, 16, Northampton</strong></p> <p>\"It all started with the war. I was coming home from school one day and I saw people running about, going crazy. I went down to the bus stop but there were no spaces on the bus; people started fighting, so I decided to walk. To my house was about two hours. I was crying and scared because people were shoving each other, trying to get to safety, so I decided to run. Luckily my mum was coming up the road and she saw me and we went home. We sat down in the house and the shooting ceased. </p> <p>\"A day passed and there was no shooting, so everyone calmed down again and started living normally. But then it all started again. It got worse. Each time someone would come saying, 'The people are getting closer.' Meaning the rebels. So my mum, she was scared but she started acting brave because she didn't want us to be scared. She said: 'We have to stay here because we've nowhere to go. God will protect us.' She's a very strong Christian. Luckily for us her boyfriend came and took us to this place in town. On our way we had things on our head, bundles, and this bullet just missed me and my mum screamed.</p> <p>\"We finally got there and there were so many people in one building. It was well dirty. There was one bathroom for everyone, so it was filthy: disgusting sewage and flies everywhere. Everyone was crowded up in this tiny room, crouching up and praying in the night. Some people would be crying and you'd hear babies screaming.</p> <p>\"During the day, there was a little market outside the fence. My mum would go and buy some stuff. Sometimes she didn't find anything much but she didn't eat and gave us the food instead. </p> <p>\"We were there for a long time and there was loud gun sound everywhere. You could hear rockets dropping next to the American embassy because we were near there in this place called Graystone, where lots of refugees were. My mum said, 'Oh, thank God.' Not that it's nice they were dropping there; she was thanking God they didn't drop where we were. Mum said so many people were dying.</p> <p>\"That war finished and we started moving out. People called it world war one. But then there was world war two, like a replay of everything that happened before. One day a lady went out to get some food and a rocket dropped and she died, outside the house. </p> <p>\"The war ceased and my dad said he was sending for me. I didn't want to go, didn't want to leave my mum - I didn't even know my dad. My uncle said, 'Any child would kill to get this opportunity [to go to England] and you're refusing it? You're going!'</p> <p>\"When I first came here it was cold and I refused to get in the elevator. I started screaming when I was in it. In Africa you get kids everywhere and it's not hard to make friends. In England, look outside: you can't see no one. </p> <p>\"I went back to Liberia last August. It was the best time ever. I didn't want to come back. But what I realised is when I was in Liberia, you don't know nothing. When I was in Liberia I thought people in England float - that they have floating cars and everything. Because I saw a plane and it was in the air, so I thought English people were always in the air. I only saw white people in books. </p> <p>\"I'm way Christian and the war in Liberia made my belief even stronger. When the bullet passed right beside my ears... I always went to church, but from that moment I actually believed in God.\"</p> <h2>Tunisia</h2> <p><strong>Sarah, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"Wearing the veil, I do get quite a lot of discrimination. I went on this ferry to the Isle of Wight. And when they say Isle of Wight, they don't lie - all white people. I was wearing my scarf, and I asked the man on the ferry could I have a tissue and he said, 'Why can't you use your scarf?' We got the captain involved. I saw the man shaking and I goes to him, 'You're shaking because you know you're lying' and he goes, 'No, it's not me, it's the boat, I promise you I'm not shaking.' I really hate it when people lie.</p> <p>\"When I am older, I want to be a lawyer and work in discrimination with Muslim people. Not just Muslim people, people from different religions who feel their religion's getting discriminated. Some people commit suicide because of that. Especially bullying. I know some people, they bully this person because they're from Pakistan and they're Muslim. And they say, 'Oh, you wash in curry instead of shampoo.' When they're born, I bet every parent wants their child to grow up polite, clever, nice and kind to everyone else. Racism isn't nice. Discrimination isn't nice. I don't think anyone likes it. But some people do it for fun. Some people hurt other people because they've been hurt. So maybe that's why they do it.\"</p> <h2>Guatemala </h2> <p><strong>Aura, 9, Oxford</strong></p> <p>\"I was about two or three months old when I came from Guatemala. My actual parents couldn't look after me because I was their seventh child, so I went to an orphanage. My parents now were looking for another child to adopt, and then they saw a picture of me. My mum is half Swedish and half Icelandic, and my dad's English. All I know of Guatemala is that I was born in the mountains and I had brothers and sisters. If I was in Guatemala now, I would probably be making those bracelets or working in fields.</p> <p>\"I have a life book [my parents made] about when I was little. It has my birth certificate, a picture of me when I was really little in the orphanage that my parents saw. A picture of my mum when she collected me. And my ticket for when I went back to England. And there is a picture of me when I first came home. And they just welcomed me home. </p> <p>\"There is a poem my mum wrote:</p> <p>Not flesh of my flesh <br>nor bone of my bone <br>but still miracles, my own. <br>Never forget for a single minute, <br>you didn't grow under my heart but in it.\"</p> <h2>Colombia</h2> <p><strong>Marcella, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"I was seven when I came to live in London. I came because there was a war in Colombia and my mum was scared that something might happen to the family. My dad worked at a car park and Mum worked in medicine. It was really hard for them to leave because my mum, she got the opportunity to become a doctor and that was her dream. She wanted to do that so badly, but unfortunately we had to come. Over here my mum cleans houses and my dad's a manager. He tells people where to clean.</p> <p>\"All our friends are Colombians. We Colombians like to dance a lot, and whenever we start to dance the neighbours downstairs complain and we have to take off our shoes. We Colombians like to have a lot of fun.</p> <p>\"There's a lot [I miss about Colombia]: my family, my grandma, my grandad. For breakfast this morning I had hot chocolate, which is a special Colombian thing. Chocolate in Colombia is really nice. It's better actually than here. [Over there, they eat chocolate] in the morning, in the afternoon, at night, whenever they feel like it. Oh yeah, we eat a lot. Colombians eat triple of what the English people would eat, but they [also] like to keep their body in shape. To be honest, ladies in Colombia have a lot of operations to look good. I saw one, she was, like, 50 and she had an operation. You can see the surgery just by looking at the face. She looked very fake. But she looked nice. </p> <p>\"We went back to Colombia in December when there are special parties. They start at six and finish any time you want to go. We stayed up with my mum, my dad, my cousin and my auntie until about five in the morning. Where we go, it's kind of dangerous because if they know that you come from England and have money, they may rob you or call your parents or family and ask for lots of money. So I was scared. I never spoke English. Only with my family because I didn't want to be talking to a stranger and then the stranger tells a person and then something happens to the family. I couldn't let that happen.\"</p> <h2>Bolivia</h2> <p><strong>Natalie, 10, London</strong></p> <p>\"I've been living in London for nearly three years. [When I started school] I didn't know many words. I'd be speechless, as though I couldn't speak. But then, as soon as I entered class, there was a girl who spoke Spanish. So I got to learn from her. </p> <p>\"In Bolivia my grandma had one maid, my mum had a maid and some other family members had maids. We don't have a maid in London. Before, my mum and the maid helped in cleaning the house, cooking the food, all this stuff, so now we all have to work as a team to finish the work.</p> <p>\"In Bolivia the situation got really bad so we needed to go. We flew to Santa Cruz and on the way we had to take a taxi and go up mountains until we got to the airport. Our maid, me and my sister, my dad and my brother were all coming. We had to leave because there was this prime minister for the people that aren't so wealthy, [who] started to get angry and wanted him in power, so started to cause trouble... it got quite scary.</p> <p>\"I miss my family in Bolivia. I can see them [on] Skype, but I can't see them properly, like you're holding their hands and stuff like that, because you're not that near to them. You're across seas.\"</p> <h2>Bahrain</h2> <p><strong>Amna, 15, London</strong></p> <p>\"There aren't as many arranged marriages in Bahrain as there used to be. Before, there was less choice, but now you see men marrying people that aren't even from their distant family. Because I'm in the royal family, we have to ask the king if the man I want to marry is OK, because he would have to see if he's a good guy. There's probably 2,000 people in the royal family, and they live all over the place. I travel a lot: I've lived in Bahrain for four years, and before that Washington DC for 11 years. In my opinion, anyone who hasn't travelled would have a narrow mind and not really a big imagination as to what is really out there. </p> <p>\"Creating a home is, of course, mostly about who you're with. My dad's the ambassador, and our house is a town house with seven floors. It has a basement. It has an elevator, thank God. And it's mostly Victorian - it's got pictures and paintings of people I've never known before and a bunch of books that I don't think anyone reads but are nice to look at, I guess. </p> <p>\"Here in London they have this rule that you can't really change windows, especially in this part of London, because they want it how it's supposed to look - how it originated. In Bahrain everyone has different architecture and new styles. When I get older I would like to live in ... I was going to say Bahrain, but I don't really know what it's turning into. It's more of a competition between Bahrain and Dubai to see who can build faster, and I'm not sure I want to be part of that. Nowadays, Bahrain is very westernised and any girl that's watched movies wants to be like an American girl or a London girl and go shopping. They're very materialistic. That's why I feel really lucky and grateful that I haven't lived there my whole life - so I know exactly what I'm missing out on. I know what I could have been and what I'm not.</p> <p>\"My school's really friendly. It's easy to find somebody in common because of the diversity of the people and the nationalities. People are accepting within this whole city. I guess because everyone moves in and out of here, and it's filled with people from all sorts of places. Just walking down the street to Starbucks, I see different people, hear different languages. I even hear Arabic a lot around this area and it makes me feel that I'm still connected with my culture, and at the same time I'm learning about other cultures. I mean, you're doing this project now on kids that are from all over the world, so that has to prove something.\"</p> <h2>Macedonia</h2> <p><strong>Sara, 12, London</strong></p> <p>\"English children need to learn to be more free, to go out, to be more kid-like. Because sometimes I get kind of tired of shopping because it's a bit grown up. I still want to live the life of a little child, play hide-and-seek, and stuff like that.\"</p> <h2>Ghana</h2> <p><strong>Kwame, 16, Leeds</strong></p> <p>\"When I got to school here, I didn't know no one. I'd just sit there and watch the teacher. I didn't do no work, because he'd speak fast and all I could hear was some teacher talking. Things turned around when I met some guy who was born here but from Ghana. He couldn't speak my language, but he could understand it. I got lost on my first day at school and on the second day as well. I got lost many times. So in the morning I would wait for him outside school and he would take me to my classes because I was proper confused - in Ghana everything is in the same class. In the morning I'd follow him wherever he goes. I used to be his little slave or something. Now, I have very good friends. I know everyone in Leeds I would say. If I see people standing I just go and start talking. I'm just popular.</p> <p>\"When you go back to Ghana people respect you because you've been in a higher place than them. People will greet you and they expect you to be rich. In some ways I am different from other teenagers in Ghana. I've been in UK, you haven't - you're in Ghana. I've known better English - you haven't, you're still learning the same English I was learning. I've been in better places - you haven't, you stayed in Ghana. Even though we are the same, the same background, the only difference is I've been in a better place - you haven't.</p> <p>\"When I'm older I would like to be a doctor. I'm about to finish my GCSE Science. My predicted grade is B. If I could wish for anything I wish to get better grades, go to a better college and be the doctor I want to be. I will work in Ghana. In Ghana, people suffer from diseases. They don't know the right diet to eat and I just want to help my people. We need proper, qualified doctors there. Always people are getting sick, getting disease of water or food contamination. All I can say is, I want Ghana to improve. I want Ghana to have the best freedom and the best schools as here and all the equipment in hospitals needed.</p> <p>\"I really thank my dad and my mum for giving me a better life, for bringing me here to have the best I can have.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kwame died suddenly on May 15 this year, from meningitis. A teacher at his school said that every day Kwame asked him when he was going to be in the magazine and be famous.</em></p> <h2>China </h2> <p><strong>Zifan (aka Fan), 16, Cardiff</strong></p> <p>\"[When I first came to the UK] I just want to stay home because I can't do nothing and I can't speak English. On my first school day I was looking for friends - I want someone to help me, I feel scared about everything. I've got lots [now], from Pakistan, Oman, Nepal, the UK and one from China. </p> <p>\"I come from near Beijing. A very good place, very beautiful. Since I've been here I've heard lots about the Olympics - that's why I couldn't go back this holiday: there are so many people in Beijing. Lots of people ask: why your father only got you, no sister, no brother? I told them in China it's just like that because they've got a lot of people. </p> <p>\"I ate pizza for the first time here. I like it because it got so much meat and everything. I still eat it, but not too much. I never eat lunch when I go to school. I don't eat breakfast. I want to get skinny. If I'm not skinny, I'll be fat. If I'm fat, everyone will say I'm panda. People say that to me because we're seeing a new movie, [Kung Fu] Panda. And when they see [it], they say I'm panda. If I was in China, I wouldn't mind because it's, like, best animal of China, of the world. If they say you're panda, that means you're very good.\"</p> <h2>Bosnia </h2> <p><strong>Melita, 15, Derby</strong></p> <p>\"I don't tend to ask my mum a lot about the war, because I know it's a painful experience for her to think back and it's quite hard for us to listen to as well, because what my parents saw is something people should never have to see. In 1992, it came to our village. Our house had just been finished - it had taken my parents three years to save up and make it all nice and Bosnian and proper, and then the Serb soldiers came, and my dad just watched it go up in flames. Most of the men got killed, and the women and children were moved out. They took us away in big army trucks. We just went from place to place. We were in a concentration camp at one point. Some people they decided to kill and some they decided to let live. Luckily, we were allowed to live. Then we got moved over into Croatia. My dad joined us there just after I'd been born. From my dad's side, I lost two uncles, one uncle's wife and three sons. And from my mum's I lost one uncle, and several cousins from both sides - one of them thought they were going to a place where they would be safe, but it was a trap and they got killed, because it was just easier to get rid of them all than send them across.</p> <p>\"At first we were planning on going to Germany - I had an auntie there - but we got rejected. We'd heard that England was accepting people, and I've got family in England, so Dad decided we apply. Luckily they accepted us. A couple of years back we got our citizenship, [so] we can stay here for ever. That was a great moment, because my parents had worried for so long that we'd be sent back. I have an uncle that went to Germany but then got sent back to Bosnia. </p> <p>\"In Derby there are quite a lot of Bosnians. I know a couple of people that are half Serbian, like their dad's Bosnian but their mum's Serbian. But most people get on now, because they're not to blame - it was the army doing it.</p> <p>\"At first we weren't accepted. It was mainly teenage kids - they were bored and it was easier to pick on the foreigners than on someone English. It was mainly throwing stones and eggs, and we had our windows broken a few times. [One time]we had two guys wanting to fight my dad. He's never done anything wrong to these people and he didn't understand why they were doing this. But it was his job to protect his family, and he called the police. They asked if we wanted to press charges but these lads were quite young and their mum was there. He thought, 'How would I feel if it were my sons?' But maybe it would have been better if he had. It came to the point when we had to have a security camera installed. When you're a child, you feel, 'What's wrong with me? Why are they doing this?' But as we grew up, we've come to accept it. We're different and we're proud to be different. I'm proud to be where I'm from. It's something I'll never hide.</p> <p>\"I've been back [to Bosnia] four times since 2004 and I love it. It's true what they say, that you do know where you're from, coz my heart belongs over there. It's not just a holiday when we go back because you see all your family - everyone comes back from all the different countries where they live. I've got family in Scotland, family in Finland, a lot in Germany, France, all over the world. If I'd grown up [in Bosnia], there would have been less employment opportunities for me. It was better back then, because obviously after the war everything was ruined, but even back then there wasn't a lot. Girls would get married at 18, 19, have children and then be housewives and look after the sheep and cows. A lot of men couldn't find a job. </p> <p>\"When people hear that I am a Muslim, it's weird for them, because apart from my name they don't have a clue that I'm foreign at all. I sound like a normal Derby person, and my family have never been strict about making us wear a headscarf, so we seem normal. We're celebrating Eid this evening, so we've got a nice big meal. Bosnians like their big meals. Bosnian food is great. When we first came to England it was the only stuff we made - pastry, potatoes, meat. My parents do eat English food now, though, ever since we got them into kebabs, fish and chips and stuff. It gives my mum a rest from cooking, so sometimes we'll get a takeaway. Mum also likes making curries now.</p> <p>\"I've gotten so used to English culture. It's just normal. Our parents used to be dead strict, because you hear these stories about children getting killed, but as we've grown up they've got used to letting us out and if, like, we need dropping off, my dad's always there to drive us.</p> <p>\"I love to read. I love really sad stories about abuse and things - I find it interesting how someone can get through all that and come out stronger. I've read a couple of really good autobiographies ... Peter Kay - legend! I love funny books, too. Anything, to be honest. </p> <p>\"When I am older, I'd like to study law at Oxford, but we all know how hard it is to get there. I like the idea of family law - helping people if there's been domestic violence, things like that. I like the fact that you can put someone away if they've done something wrong. If I get married, I know my parents want a Bosnian. When they were growing up, it was always Bosnians for Bosnians, and they'd just like us to keep our culture. In a way I would like that [too], because I would love the fact that my child could be whole, one thing, totally Bosnian. But you don't know, do you, with there being so many cultures here and so many religions? At the end of the day, you fall in love with whoever you fall in love with.</p> <p>\"I'd like to go back to Bosnia when I'm really old, because I'd like to die there so I can be buried in my own country. Apart from that, I don't think anyone would want to go back really.\"</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p><strong>Nadine, 6, Cardiff</strong></p> <p>\"I have brown eyes and I have one tooth missing. I have, well, sometimes I have red hair - this bit and this bit - and I have brown hair and black hair. I have a mark and I have some earrings. I look stupid because I'm black - I'm disgusting, you know? I look like a snail. I don't like myself. And my tongue is red.\"</p> <h2>Ivory Coast</h2> <p><strong>Inza, 15, London</strong></p> <p>\"When my parents were telling me, Inza, you're coming to England, I was so excited: I thought England was going to be some big thing for me, I thought England was going to be paradise, but it's just a little country, it's a normal country like every country in the world. The houses are nice and everything, but there's no big difference. What I mean is, I met the same black people here as in Africa ... there are more black people here [in Brixton] than white people. </p> <p>\"In Abidjan where I lived, I knew all the people down there, so there ain't nothing going to happen to me. In Africa, if you see anyone walking around, you just say hello. But in England if you see anyone and say hello, they will not say hello back. They have to get to know you properly. When I arrived here I was saying hello to everybody but they wasn't answering me back so I stopped. I tell myself there's no big deal me saying it again. </p> <p>\"Here, age 12, you're already in a gang ... and age 15 you're already making a crime. But I'm 15 and I am not doing that stuff. Mum raised me properly. All I do on the weekends is wake up in the mornings, clean the house quick and go and play football. I miss the free life in Africa. Over there I can go out at six o'clock in the morning and I can come back at one o'clock in the night. Safe, safe, nothing going to happen to me. Here ... already at seven o'clock it's getting dark and if you go out somewhere that your parents don't know ... even if they do know, you can get stabbed on the bus. Too much crime on the streets here. </p> <p>\"I feel happy to be with my parents but I don't feel at home here in England. In the future I want to get some money, go back to Africa, build a big building for all my family to live in. That's my hope. Take my family out of trouble and have a happy ending. If I met other young people in Africa who wanted to get out and come here I'd say, well, true to say in England there's a lot of money. In Africa there's not a lot of money. Maybe that's the only thing I can say you can move to England for. But if I was you I would stay here, coz it's a lot more fun. That's what I would say to them. England is boring, no fun at all.\"</p> <h2>Sudan</h2> <p><strong>Emmanuel, 13, Bolton<br></strong><br>\"We had to leave my village because there was problem of war, so we decided to escape. When we used to stay at school studying [in the refugee camp], we might hear rebels. They're everywhere ... we have to run to find a place to hide. If you want to run to the bush, you run there and hide, to save yourself. If you want to run home, you run home. Sometimes you go in your bed. You don't know if they're outside ... and if they find you, they'll take you in the bush. Sometimes they might make you join their army. And they usually come at dark because nobody can see them coming.\"</p> <h2>Bhutan </h2> <p><strong>Trishala, 14, Huddersfield</strong></p> <p>\"We came from Thimphu in 2000. The Bhutanese weren't getting treated right, so they wanted to get away. My parents had to wear this special uniform. One night, Dad was walking the dog and he didn't have it on. The police put him in jail for the night. Here the fear is the crime, in Bhutan it's the police.</p> <p>\"I don't know about Bhutanese things. I remember it's hilly. And the kids have chinky eyes type. People who don't know me think I'm Chinese. </p> <p>\"My dad wants me to be a doctor. I wouldn't mind that. But I also have my eye on being a fashion designer, living in New York or Boston. </p> <p>\"If I was living in Bhutan I probably wouldn't be as confident as I am. There the girls help their mum with the cooking and cleaning. Here I've been doing tae kwon do for three years and I've got best Northern British Championship. I've got medals from school for netball and badminton. And for football I got player of the match five times and a special award for playing football in the boys' team because they couldn't get anyone else. And I got selected to go to Huddersfield Town and Leeds girls' football teams. I've done majorettes, tap dance, ballet, street dancing, ice skating...\"</p> <h2>Austria </h2> <p><strong>Paul, 13, Richmond, Surrey</strong></p> <p>\"I've been living in the UK for four years now. We came for my dad's work - he's an investment banker. I lived in a small town in Austria. I miss the mountains there because in the winter you can do skiing and ice skating. London is much bigger and it's not as relaxed. You've always got to be guarded by your parents and we have to phone them to tell them where we are and what we are doing. In Austria you can go wherever you want. We might - I don't think so - but we might get kidnapped, or maybe car drivers drive over us, or something like that.\" </p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p><strong>Eve, 8, London</strong></p> <p>\"I came here in 2004 because of Daddy's work. He went back to Canada [but we stayed], because Mummy had a boyfriend and I have school, so I want to stay. Cos my dad moved this year, I'm going to go back more often. I'm going on my own for Christmas. I'm really excited. I miss him.</p> <p>\"In Canada I had waffles and pancakes and cereal for breakfast. Here they have more salty stuff like egg and butter. Canadian people have bigger teeth and most English people have darker hair. If I could wish for anything, I would wish for my dad to come back. And to fly.\" </p> <h2>Lesotho</h2> <p><strong>Mosetse, 16, London</strong></p> <p>\"In Lesotho the majority of kids in orphanages is due to parents dying of HIV. A cousin of mine died of HIV in 2004. It's painful cos when someone is deteriorating like that, you're helpless. I think it's got worse since I left. I remember in school learning that the population is 2 million and now it's a million or something. People have died due to HIV and poverty. Prince Harry went to Lesotho and he was talking about a young girl who got raped by an HIV-positive man. And she got infected and that was very painful. If I could wish for anything, I'd wish for a cure for HIV.\"</p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p><strong>Thorunn, 13, London</strong></p> <p>\"Iceland is a small country, so there's more freedom there. I could go anywhere in Iceland without my parents worrying. I miss that.</p> <p>\"I know a lot about the climate crisis - in Iceland they're doing [a lot of things] to prevent it. We heat our houses with hot water, not electricity, but I guess that's more of a natural resource - hot water comes from the earth there. In Iceland it's popular to wear wool sweaters, but if someone [came] to my school wearing one, people would think that weird. Also, the food is very different. When you say it out loud, I guess it sounds nasty. There's a snack that is basically a dried fish - it smells horrible, but most Icelandic people love it. Once I was on a school trip and I had a bit with me. After a few minutes one of the girls said, \"What is that smell?\" They were grossed out.\"</p> <h2>Angola</h2> <p><strong>Caterina, 14, Leeds</strong></p> <p>\"In Angola you got a lot people living in a house, innit, and you can walk barefoot. I miss people having a laugh. There's many festivals, people dressed up, enjoying themselves and partying -until 6am - when you party, you sleep outside. Here, when it's cold, you stay in and get bored. There you got things to do. Even if it's raining, you can just play in the rain, because it's not cold. </p> <p>\"Angola is a lovely place, I just wish people from England would feel free to go there, instead of thinking we gonna starve. I want to let people know that in Africa there is actually food and we actually eat, and we're healthy. It's a bit annoying when people always show the bad part of Africa on TV. Like, some people actually cry, saying, 'Oh, children need water.' Not all parts of Africa are poor. There are rich ones that are proper nice.\"</p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p><strong>Izabel, 7, Windsor</strong></p> <p>\"I came from Poland a year ago. When it's summer [in Poland] it's very hot. And in winter it's quite cold and lots of snow goes up to your legs. </p> <p>\"First I came on a bus for a visit, for a week. Afterwards I went in a car, drove from Poland. [When Mum has her baby] my granny's going to come and look after me and the baby, and afterwards my auntie and little cousin's going to come. Then maybe my whole family's going to come. </p> <p>\"Polish people look very different. Some have a rash and spots on their face - disgusting. And Polish people's skin is sort of a whiteish colour.\"</p> <h2>Togo</h2> <p><strong>Larissa, 16, London</strong></p> <p>\"I don't think I would ever be able to live back in Togo. It's actually quite hard to live there. We basically have to change the way we eat depending on the seasons. What you would normally eat became expensive when there was a shortage of food. But here it's not like that - you can eat whatever you want, whenever you want. </p> <p>\"The first thing I noticed about here was that the air was so much cleaner - in Togo there's a lot of dust and plastic bags. News reports were also really different. Normally, in Togo, the news report was just one person sitting there telling you about what happens in the country. It was really... subjective. But the news here is pretty much objective. You just have to work it out for yourself - they don't tell you how to think about it.\"</p> <h2>Afghanistan </h2> <p><strong>Sara, 10, Manchester</strong></p> <p>\"I came here to get educated, because [at home] the schools weren't good, and because of the war - my uncle was killed by the Taliban. It's a small country and really hot. [My dad] came [to the UK] to see if we can visit. He's a teacher: he travels to people's houses to revise the Holy Qur'an. </p> <p>\"At home I don't wear trousers with a T-shirt. It's not in the Islamic way. There have been times when I wanted to wear short skirts, with tights under, but I'm not allowed. Skirts should be rainbowy colours. I don't want just boring black or grey or white. </p> <p>\"When I come [home] from school, I pray and read the Qur'an, then watch TV. We always watch Pakistan news - a channel called Geo. Most of the time there's wars, but sometimes there's happiness, because when American soldiers are killed, they celebrate - they don't fight our country again.'</p> <h2>Uzbekistan</h2> <p><strong>Shereen, 8, Orpington</strong></p> <p>\"My mum and dad work for the BBC. They were journalists in Uzbekistan but they were also very famous and a bit rich actually. At school I like maths. It's fun and makes you kind of clever. But when I'm older I'd like to be an author or a poetress, like JK Rowling, because I could live like a celebrity. This is a poem I wrote, Hopping Spring:</p> <p>Hopping spring, hopping spring<br>Let all the bunnies bounce<br>The trees wailing like the sun<br>And the postman is mailing all the letters<br>Let's hop and hop like a rabbit<br>Let's plant some pots in the teapot<br>Let's enjoy the breeze as it goes past the pots as we eat jelly tots</p> <p>\"I wrote it in wintertime because I was excited about spring, imagining how it would be like.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/interactive/2008/oct/18/children-britain-world\">Interactive: meet children from all 193 countries</a></p>",
  "<h2>\u00a31.50 ... to give Iceland the cold shoulder</h2> <p>A good few months ago, when all seemed bright in the world of finance, I was deciding one Saturday morning where I should put my few quids-worth of savings.

This was following a summer during which we had turned off the gas supply (the first time in 18 years), and relied on the immersion heater for hot water, meaning that only 80p of gas had been used in the last quarter. The statement also showed our account was close on \u00a3150 in credit, a \"buffer\" that offsets the higher fuel usage during the colder winter months.</p> <p>On querying the increase, our account was \"reviewed\", and we were told we should be paying just \u00a346 a month, but it was suggested we keep our payments at their current monthly \u00a354, to be reassessed at the end of the next quarter. </p> <p>Following all the recent media reports on fuel price hikes, I wonder how many people will just accept the increases as \"one of those things\" and be paying higher fuel charges than necessary? </p> <p>It seems to me we are providing BG with a large interest-free business loan, for which we gain no benefit.<br><strong>Rebecca Mackett, Wisbech, Cambs</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Re: Sean Powell's story (Default notice and \u00a3300 bill for a flat with no gas, September 27) - we had a similar, though fortunately less tragic and more comic, experience with British Gas. We started receiving bills with the wrong name but correctly addressed.</p> <p>We returned them, pointing out that not only did we have no gas in the house but there was no gas in the village. We received no response, other than escalating threats, culminating in statements that they intended to gain forced entry to disconnect the (non-existent) gas. My husband finally managed to reach someone on the phone and a helpful official arrived to confirm that absence of gas.</p> <p>After a month or two, the bills and threats started again and were only halted when we involved Citizens Advice.

I live in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, and have received communications from British Gas for over four years. Sometimes they are standard bills but at other times are nasty threats about non-payment. From time to time, a nice man calls to take a reading. The fact is, I don't have a gas supply and never have had one. British Gas seems to think there is a meter in the cellar but I don't have one of those, either.</p> <p>I have to explain, countless times, that the bill should go to High Street, Saffron Walden, and not High Street, Hinxton, Saffron Walden.

Towards the end, Ryanair states that they lose just 0.5 bags per 1,000 passengers. Given the exorbitant charges for handling bags and the fact the passenger must check-in in person rather than online (which itself attracts a second fee on the same bag), it would be interesting to know how many bags they actually handle per 1,000 passengers.<br><strong>David Healy, via email </strong></p>",

  "<h2>Prudential's mistake over my pension</h2> <p>The Prudential failed to notify my employer of a \u00a324,000 lump sum Prudential additional voluntary contribution (AVC) pension plan. So I lost out when I retired in March 2007. Pru apologised for the error but I still cannot access the money. I have tried the Pensions Advisory Service but, more than a year on, nothing has been resolved. Where do I go from here?<br><strong>VB, Brighton</strong></p> <p>You took advantage of new pension possibilities after April 2006 to come up with a clever piece of planning. Six months before retiring, you invested \u00a324,000 in a Pru AVC risk-free fund, gaining \u00a39,600 in 40% tax relief. Besides the Revenue refund, all the AVC went towards your tax-free lump sum, avoiding annuity purchase and ensuring you maximised the amount coming from your final salary scheme with East Sussex council, which has built-in annual uplifts. But the Pru forgot to tell your employer about the AVC, so it was ignored in the calculations when you retired in March 2007.</p> <p>In June 2007, the Pru realised its mistake and wrote to the council, asking it to go back to square one because of the faulty computation. But the council said that was impossible under its scheme rules.</p> <p>However, under a little-known Revenue decision which counts before any scheme rules, you have three months to reverse a pensions error. Once this was realised, the Pru worked with East Sussex for a change - but technically, it was too late.</p> <p>It is obvious what you wanted to do with the Pru AVC and that the Pru's error frustrated your attempt to invest the lump sum elsewhere. The Pru accepts this. It will pay you the lump sum (now \u00a326,000) and account for any tax bill that might arise, putting you back where you were. Thanks to the market collapse, your investment fund will now be better value. And it will send you \u00a3500 and a bouquet to say sorry for the delay and inconvenience you suffered.</p> <h2>The unwanted call to my infirm mother</h2> <p>My mother was phoned in June - the week my father died - by the Gift Company, which sells club-style holidays. She passed the phone to my wife, who told the Gift Company that my mother suffers from dementia, and asked them not to bother her again. She was assured my mother's details would be removed.</p> <p>But recently my mother told us, despite knowing she shouldn't reveal card details over the phone, that she had given her number and \u00a3299 on September 18 to the Gift Company for \"three weeks of accommodation\" plus \"free\" offers including a UK hotel break that isn't free at all - there is a compulsory purchase of food at varying sums per hotel. Can you help?<br><strong>KP, Newcastle </strong></p> <p>It may have an 0800 number but the Gift Company phone has a Spanish ringtone. It's in Alicante, outside the UK Telephone Preference Service, to which your mother subscribes.</p> <p>It has her details because she (and your late father) once bought timeshares, which are now worthless.</p> <p>The \u00a3299 buys three separate weeks in a flat somewhere - probably off-season. Anyone taking up the offer still has to pay for travel and food, so it is not a great bargain. But the real problem is section 16 in the terms and conditions, saying you are obliged to attend a \"presentation\" or pay the \"full price\" for the flat rental - whatever that is. You tried complaining and were promised a call - but no one bothered.</p> <p>Capital Letters spoke to the Gift Company, where a \"manager\" said it had no control over the phone call list.</p> <p>But general manager Richard Jinks says: \"There is a system in place to remove people from the list. We are a very professional company.\" He promised to bypass his \"complaints process\" and contact you within 24 hours with a refund. He has failed to do this.</p> <h2>Whirlwind romance cleaned out my cash</h2> <p>I met a woman and, after a whirlwind romance, she moved in with me and we set up a joint NatWest account. It was only four months later I realised she was an alcoholic and I threw her out. Then I discovered she had cleared out the bank account (even though I had never authorised her to have a cash machine card) and pushed the account into a huge overdraft - she's had around \u00a310,500. NatWest refuses to give me the money back. I have issued legal proceedings against the bank. What do you advise?<br><strong>DK, London</strong></p> <p>Don't waste money on legal action.</p> <p>Letting a new woman into your home (and bed) is one thing. Giving her the keys to your money is another. There is little you can do. Having a joint account gives both equal rights, no matter where the money came from, as it is the property of both.</p> <p>Most of the withdrawals were made with the chequebook you were each given. And you have no right to prevent her asking the bank for a debit card. You are both liable for the debt - but as she has fled, the bank will chase you.</p> <p>If a couple breaks up, the bank can set up two separate accounts, but only with the agreement of both parties and provided there is nothing owing. The bank will now move to have your legal action struck out.</p> <h2>Computers do the silliest things...</h2> <p>I use - and like - Nationwide internet banking. But when I logged on recently, I found only three accounts on screen. My fourth, an e-bond about to mature, had disappeared. Worried about fraud, I phoned Nationwide. It said it had removed the account due to a mismatch with my address. It seems the first three accounts do not include my house name, while the e-bond does. There was no further reason. What is going on?<br><strong>JS, Cheshire</strong></p> <p>The computer seems to have lost any concept of common sense. The house name is additional to your address of four years and was accepted by Nationwide when you applied for the bond in October 2007.</p> <p>You were then told to go to a branch, which would verify the address from a Nationwide bank statement. It is not clear how this helps, as your house name is not on the statements, or why the security codes of other online accounts are not enough. Nor does this explain the lack of September interest.</p> <p>When Capital Letters intervened, Nationwide said it froze the e-bond because a letter had been returned by the post office, alerting the computer to the address discrepancy. The return could have been merely a mis-delivery by Royal Mail. If there was a security worry, why were the other accounts left live?</p> <p>Nationwide admits its automated systems are \"not pragmatic\". It will now write to apologise, credit the missing \u00a3433 interest and send you \u00a375 compensation for the time you have spent chasing your own money.</p> <h2>... and can leave you without insurance</h2> <p>My car insurer, Norwich Union, cancelled my cover as it had not had a reply from a letter which I did not receive. Despite being with NU for four years, it wants new proof of my no-claims bonus, which it has cut from four to three years. Why?'<strong>MF, Suffolk</strong></p> <p>To add to your woes, NU wanted a further \u00a355 - and you were unknowingly left without cover. It is not clear what has happened here, but as you went through the internet-based NU Direct, it is probably another case of a computer suffering from a lack of common sense. Because you did not reply to its demands, it automatically wiped out your no-claims discount. NU will now reinstate the policy, increase your discount to five years, wipe out the \u00a355 and send \u00a325 in vouchers to say sorry.</p>",
  "<p>Fresh allegations of misconduct were made against arms company BAE yesterday as the government was condemned for failing to clamp down on corruption. It was disclosed that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has accused BAE of concealing the truth about its Saudi arms deals in order fraudulently to get government insurance cover.</p> <p>International anti-bribery monitors from the OECD published a report detailing allegations made during the aborted investigations into BAE's \u00a343bn Saudi arms deals. BAE got insurance for the deals from the export credit agency, the ECGD. It is alleged that BAE concealed from Whitehall the existence of agents and intermediaries to whom it was making secret payments at the time.</p> <p>SFO representatives told the OECD there had been \"alleged bribery-related fraudulent misrepresentations by BAE to ECGD\". The SFO witnesses told the French and Canadian investigators that \"they had supplied to ECGD the evidence of bribery-related fraud against it ... involving alleged misrepresentations by the company to ECGD in connection with the issuance of insurance\". But the export credit agency had done nothing, according to the report. The OECD monitors said: \"The SFO indicated that it considered that it was up to the ECGD to determine what to do.\"</p> <p>ECGD officials refused to tell the international monitors why they had taken no action, claiming they were bound by \"commercial confidence\". The OECD team said they were \"seriously concerned by the lack of evidence of any response by ECGD to the fraud allegations\".</p> <p>BAE last night refused any comment on the substance of the allegations. The company said: \"At no time has the SFO put to the company any allegation of wrongdoing in respect of the company's obtaining of ECGD cover in relation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, nor has it advanced to the company any evidence.\"</p> <p>The detailed analysis in the 75-page OECD report puts British ministers in the dock. The authors, in a team chaired by Swiss law professor Mark Pieth, condemned the UK's alleged tolerance of corruption.</p> <p>The working group, which monitors whether Britain is abiding by an international anti-corruption treaty, said it was \"disappointed and seriously concerned\" by British official behaviour.</p> <p>The report focused on Britain's repeated failure to make good its promises to pass an effective anti-corruption law, as well as the international uproar when the former prime minister, Tony Blair, forced the Serious Fraud Office to drop its investigation into secret payments made by BAE, the UK's biggest arms company.</p> <p>Gordon Brown nominated Jack Straw, the justice minister, as the government's \"anti-corruption champion\" last week. </p> <p>Straw said he welcomed the OECD's contribution to the debate but failed to make any specific commitment to a timetable for a reformed anti-corruption law. The law commission is due to report again on the subject next month, and Straw said a draft bill would be published.</p> <p>The OECD report accused the government of spending the last six years promising to reform the law, but never doing so. Yesterday's report picked out a few signs of minor improvement in British conduct, but systematically dismantled British excuses for never prosecuting any major corruption cases.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats, the only major political party not implicated in charges of collusion with past bribery on arms deals, last night joined anti-corruption campaigners in welcoming the findings: David Howarth, their justice spokesman, said \"This is a devastating report.\"</p>",

This is everything No Country wasn't: light, high-spirited, amusing, irreverent.

  "<p>Breakfast, as mothers the world over are wont to lecture their kids ad nauseam, is the single most important meal of the day. Now, according to Kellogg's boffins, there's conclusive scientific proof that people who load up on cereal every morning are, get this, less likely to turn into berks. Yep, leave those geeks in Switzerland to find the God particle and let Kellogg's get on with the really important stuff. And now lending credibility to their earth-shattering findings is the heavyweight testimony of the nation's favourite breakfast-eating lesbian icon in a tracksuit. Please be upstanding then for Her Royal Highness Dame Kelly Holmes! We join her as she stands at a bus stop watching some dozy schoolboy struggle as the contents of his bag spill out on to the pavement. \"He obviously skipped breakfast this morning,\" she huffs, without lifting a double Olympic gold digit to help the lad. Cut to a clueless office worker trying to use an unplugged photocopier. \"And she skipped breakfast too,\" she tuts; just tell her to PUT THE PLUG IN! Finally, we segue to an angry goth in his bedroom, his makeup ruined by tears, as he pulls on his trenchcoat, loads up his semi-automatic weapons and heads off to the school gym: \"And he's clearly missed his Coco Pops Straws too.\" OK, so the last one's not entirely true but you get the point, which, of course, is that missing out on your muesli can wreak messy havoc with your mind. \"Wake up to breakfast,\" she concludes, with all the charisma of a sodden park bench, \"and see if you can perform better.\" Clearly Dame Kelly's missing her Crunchy Nut Cornflakes as well then...</p>",
  "<p>Controversy over Britain's abortion laws will be reignited next week when MPs are allowed a free vote on a range of proposals to update the 40-year-old legislation.</p> <p>Pro-choice MPs have put forward amendments for more liberal rules that would allow nurses to perform abortions and end the \"two doctor rule\", allowing terminations to be approved by just one doctor. A third proposal seeks to legalise abortions in Northern Ireland. All are supported by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology.</p> <p>The debate will reopen a row that was put on hold over summer, when the government unexpectedly withdrew its flagship fertility and embryology bill, which has been used as an opportunity to update the 1967 Abortion Act. The government was accused of delaying the debate until after the byelection in Glasgow East, which has a strong Catholic community.</p> <p>Wednesday's vote will include amendments backed by MPs on the religious right that seek to restrict women's access to abortion by demanding up to three doctors' signatures, and fresh restrictions on late abortions when a baby is found to be carrying a severe medical defect. They are also seeking to block moves to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>In May the government defeated an amendment backed by David Cameron to reduce the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. Supporters for the amendment argued there had been a rise in the survivability of babies born before 24 weeks, contradicting evidence from doctors and medical institutions such as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p> <p>The government has set aside only Wednesday to debate the bill and to the dismay of many MPs may leave voting on abortion law to the end of the day.</p> <p>Charles Walker, Tory MP for Broxbourne, is proposing to ban doctors from performing late stage abortions when scans reveal major birth defects, unless the baby would be \"so seriously handicapped that the child would be incapable of having or achieving a recognisable quality of life\".</p> <p>Jane Fisher, head of Antenatal Results and Choices, a charity that provides objective support to parents going through antenatal testing, opposed the restrictions. \"This comes from the misapprehension that parents are making irresponsible decisions. There aren't hordes of parents out there looking for perfection and making decisions on conditions that aren't serious.\"</p> <p>Conservative backbenchers Edward Leigh and Angela Watkinson propose to give women a week-long cooling-off period after seeking an abortion during which they must receive counselling on the risks of a termination. </p> <p>Diane Abbott, whose proposal will extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland, said: \"This is not about coercing people to have abortions. It's about the right to choose, and without that women in Northern Ireland are second class citizens.\" Fears that too little time has been set aside for the debate have been exacerbated by allegations the government has warned backbenchers legalising abortion in Northern Ireland could endanger the peace process. \"The government may filibuster so we don't even get to debate the amendments, in which case they will fall off the table,\" said Abbott.</p>",
  "<p>Former secretary of state <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/colin-powell\">Colin Powell</a> is expected to use a high-profile television appearance tomorrow to end months of speculation by throwing his support behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>.</p> <p>His decision to go on television just two weeks before the election suggests he has finally made up his mind.</p> <p>Powell, a four-star general who worked closely with three Republican presidents, said he would decide between Obama and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>, a long-time friend, after watching the presidential debates, the last of which was held on Wednesday.</p> <p>His endorsement would be the biggest Obama has secured so far. As a prominent member of President George Bush's administration, he may shift some Republican-leaning voters into Obama's camp.</p> <p>McCain's campaign team admitted privately it would be a blow, not least because it would be another day in which Obama dominated the news. But Democratic strategists are divide about the benefits. One said yesterday he was concerned it could backfire. He suggested that Powell's decision might be seen as being based on racial solidarity and that could alienate some white voters already reluctant to back Obama on grounds of race.</p> <p>The sceptical strategist added that Powell, though once so popular he was considered as a potential candidate for the White House, was badly tarnished by his involvement, as secretary of state, in making the case for Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Powell, 71, who is to appear on NBC's Meet the Press, told a conference in Washington last month that he was undecided. \"I've said to my beloved friend and colleague, John McCain, a friend of 25 years - John, I love you - but I'm not just going to vote for you on the basis of our affection and friendship,\" Powell said.</p> <p>\"I've said to Barack Obama, I admire you, I'll give you all the advice I can, but I won't vote for you just because you're black. We have to move beyond this.\"</p> <p>Obama won the endorsement yesterday of the Washington Post. \"There are few public figures we have respected more over the years than Senator John McCain. Yet it is without ambivalence that we endorse Senator Barack Obama for president,\" the Post said.</p> <p>The newspaper said McCain had lost its support because of the way he conducted his campaign - singling out his choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate. The Post was the 40th newspaper to endorse Obama for president. So far McCain has the support of 15 newspapers.</p> <p>The presidential race continued to be transfixed by Joe the Plumber, the Ohio man invoked by McCain in this week's final debate as the symbol of what he claimed was Obama's \"class warfare\" against ordinary working people. Joe Wurzelbacher's 15 minutes of fame is now stretching into its third full day and shows no sign of abating.</p> <p>McCain organisers have been trying to get Wurzelbacher to appear alongside McCain at a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, tomorrow. But invitations to appear on the weekend's TV talkshows may prove more alluring. Though he has refused to say who will get his vote, Wurzelbacher's story has prompted a fiercely partisan reaction from the US media. </p> <p>Liberal bloggers focused on idiosyncracies in his personal details - the fact that he owes almost $1,200 in back taxes, that he has had no formal plumbing training and holds no licence, and that his full name is not Joe at all but Samuel J Wurzelbacher.</p> <p>Rightwing bloggers retaliated against what they called such smear-mongering. \"The left's political plumbers are attacking the messenger ... It's standard operating procedure for the Obama thug machine,\" wrote Michelle Malkin.</p> <p>In Pennsylvania on Thursday McCain told a rally that Wurzelbacher had been the real winner of the debate \"because people are not going to let Senator Obama raise taxes in a tough economy\", prompting chants of \"Joe! Joe! Joe!\" from the crowd.</p> <p>In New Hampshire, Obama asked supporters: \"How many plumbers do you know making a quarter of a million dollars a year?\"</p> <p>Meanwhile McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, is taking her critics at first hand by appearing in Saturday Night Live. The entertainment show has been running a popularly parody of the Alaska governor by comedian Tina Fey.</p> <h2>The week</h2> <p><strong>Confession of the week</strong></p> <p>\"If I were watching Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me, right?

  "<p>After making your own soup and snacks, you'll need good storage solutions if your children want to take the homemade goods to school. To keep things cool and edible, a useful lunchbox should fasten well, be easy to clean and durable. Try to find ones that don't take up too much space and contain a good insulator. Everything else is down to personal choice: do you want frilly patterns? A section for ice packs (very useful in the summer)? A box covered with the face of a popular cartoon character?</p> <p>Look to Swiss company <strong>Sigg</strong> for the best quality. The <strong>Aluminium clip-shut lunch box </strong> in the medium size (\u00a317.99, <a href=\"http://kiddieskitchen.co.uk/store/default.asp\">kiddieskitchen.co.uk</a>) is hardy and the rubber seal inside makes it leak-proof.

The final option is the <strong>Polar Gear Fold Up Lunch Cooler</strong> (\u00a33.99, see <a href=\"http://www.polargear.co.uk/\">polargear.co.uk</a> for stockists), which is insulated and comes in pink, turquoise and dark blue.

Is the outer casing durable? And how many litres does it hold?</p> <p>If you want something that will keep soup warm, then you're obviously after a vacuum flask: the flasks by Thermos are fantastic and come with a five- to ten-year guarantee. A great buy is the <strong>Thermos Multi Purpose stainless steel flask O.8L</strong> (\u00a313, <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/\">johnlewis.com</a>) which keeps food hot for eight hours. The cap doubles up as a cup, and it's easy to carry. A close second is the <strong>Thermos Everyday Stainless Steel Food Flask</strong> (\u00a316, see <a href=\"http://thermos.co.uk/\">thermos.co.uk</a> for stockists) - it only keeps food hot for five hours but is made of \"virtually unbreakable\" stainless steel. Finally a cute design (available from Little Trekkers, \u00a311.99) - the <strong>Thermos CoolKidz Stainless Steel Food Jar</strong>, which comes in purple, blue and pink.

The capital is largely invested in corporate bonds, which are considered a safe haven except when a sharp economic downturn forces corporates into insolvency.</p> <p>Most bonds held by insurers are AAA-rated and invested in large, stable businesses, but around \u00a3105bn of the \u00a3237bn sterling corporate bond market is issued by banks. Property companies are also large bond issuers and their fortunes have collapsed in recent years.</p> <p>Upmarket estate agents Savills said yesterday that its profits were likely to more than halve this year after commercial property deals fell off a cliff two weeks ago. It said any life left in the commercial property sector had drained away after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. </p> <p>While the government has so far worked to protect bondholders in banks, investors remain nervous that the turmoil in the markets could yet get beyond the control of governments and regulators. They also fear other seemingly robust businesses could fail if the western economies suffer severe recessions next year, as many economists expect.</p> <p>But other sector watchers and industry sources said that while further stock market falls would dent the finances of insurers, recent changes in the way regulators set their capital requirements mean that dramatic declines would be required to force dividend cuts or rights issues. </p> <p>Insurance analyst Ned Cazalet said the finances of insurers were overhauled in 2004 following the near-collapse of the industry in 2003. He said some insurers that have invested in property and equities to cover guarantees on annuities and with-profits policies could be forced by the regulator to merge or seek extra capital.</p> <p>However, he said the situation was unlikely to mimic the problems faced by banks as insurers are obliged to hold enough capital to meet their obligations to policyholders as well as an additional buffer to cope with unexpected shocks. The leading UK life insurers hold an extra layer of capital on top of this. </p> <p>In 2003, a sustained downturn in the stock market forced insurers to sell part of their equity holdings in order to maintain their capital strength. The disposals exacerbated the stock market fall. In the aftermath, the Financial Services Authority toughened its capital rules for insurers. </p> <p>Aviva refuted a note from analysts Goldman Sachs which questioned whether the insurer could afford to pay its dividend at the end of the year. Aviva said it pays its dividend out of operational earnings, which were on track. \"While no industry is immune to the turmoil in the stock markets, our capital reserves are robust.\"</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch yesterday railed against British regulators for dealing a \"huge injustice\" to BSkyB over a potentially costly row surrounding the broadcaster's minority stake in its rival ITV.</p> <p>Speaking at the annual meeting of his News Corporation empire, Murdoch attacked the Competition Commission for ordering BSkyB to cut its 17.9% stake in ITV to less than 7.5%.</p> <p>\"The purchase of those shares in ITV was totally within the law,\" said Murdoch. \"It's a huge injustice that Sky has suffered and it's still subject to court review.\"</p> <p>The commission decided last year that BSkyB's substantial interest in ITV was anti-competitive and against the public interest. The ruling was backed by the former business secretary John Hutton and was upheld by an appeals tribunal last month.</p> <p>Murdoch told investors that BSkyB ought to be able to own up to 20% in the broadcaster, citing a ceiling imposed by the 2003 Communications Act. </p> <p>He said the issue had been \"parked up with various quangos and committees\" and was not yet final. BSkyB is considering whether to take the issue to the appeals court.</p> <p>BSkyB bought the stock for \u00a3940m two years ago to foil a takeover of ITV by Virgin Media. It has been forced to write down the value of the investment by \u00a3660m because of a plunge in ITV's share price and BSkyB executives are reluctant to sell at a depressed price.</p> <p>Addressing shareholders at New York's Hudson theatre, Murdoch delivered a gloomy assessment of the global economy, acknowledging that the credit crunch has \"weakened advertising markets and beaten down our share price\".</p> <p>He said that News Corp's diversified interests and strong balance sheet left it well prepared for a downturn but added: \"2009 may be a year of unprecedented challenges - we cannot fool ourselves into pretending otherwise.\"</p> <p>There was little dissent among the 50 or so investors present, except for a question over the appointment to News Corp's board of Natalie Bancroft, a 28-year-old opera singer, to represent the Bancroft family which sold the Wall Street Journal to Murdoch last year.</p> <p>An Australian shareholder activist asked if the meeting could hear from Bancroft on \"what values she adds to the board\", while another investor questioned whether she would stand up to her all-male, middle-aged boardroom colleagues.</p> <p>Murdoch replied that Bancroft, who lives in Europe, had already visited all branches of the company: \"She's one of the most diligent new directors I've ever seen.\"</p> <p>Bancroft said that her age was a strength: \"I'm young - this is a company driven by a younger market. I think I bring a youthful perspective.\"</p> <p>She declined to say how much time she was devoting to News Corp: \"I'm not calculating it in terms of days per month. I'm spending time on both of my jobs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pitching whimsical songs about knicker-stealing transvestites alongside freeform out-of-control wig-outs, Pink Floyd and their enigmatic frontman Syd Barrett kickstarted the British psychedelic scene. An art school kid from Cambridge, Barrett was well versed in the kind of surreal and Dadaist comedy that became synonymous with the Floyd's first album and a half. But, after literally painting himself into a corner - Barrett's flatmate, artist Duggie Fields, remembers him painting the entirety of his room, dusty floorboards and all, and being unable to leave it - Barrett had a breakdown and returned to his hometown.

  "<h2>Why was the Olympic parade held this week?</h2> <p>Standing by Nelson's Column, wearing a scarf to keep at bay the chill of a crisp October morning, with a union flag in one hand and a coffee in the other, might have seemed a rather odd way to celebrate a sporting success that ended weeks ago in the 100-degree heat of Beijing. But have you ever organised a dinner party for 10? One couple are not sure they can make it. The others have trouble with the babysitter. And as for the closest friends, why won't they tell us right now that they are free? </p> <p>Try, then, putting together a \"do\" for 500 athletes - not all professional, so it means time off work - which needs a 1.6-mile stretch of the capital's busiest streets to be closed, let alone finding a television timeslot. And, above all, making sure it can take place on the day the athletes are spending the evening with the Queen.</p> <p>The \"parade of heroes\" on Thursday was a glorious reminder of a summer of triumph not only for Britain's Olympians, who won 47 medals in Beijing, but that of the Paralympians, who brought home 102 gongs from China. </p> <p>The athletes had their date at the Palace, and while it was hardly easy to bring together 500 competitors just the once, it would have proved impossible to do it twice if the parade was on a different day to their date with the Queen.</p> <p>Unlike regular team sports, where the players meet up on a day-to-day basis, the majority are individual performers. Some live at different ends of the country yet are part of the same squad. As Christine Ohuruogu, Britain's Olympic 400m gold medallist, said a day before the parade: \"It will be great to catch up with the team and have everyone in the same place at once.\"</p> <p>Indeed, but for the organisers, not something that can be done overnight.<br><strong>Michael Phillips</strong></p> <h2>Why is Moyles losing listeners to Wogan?</h2> <p>Because people are growing up, that's why - it's down to demographics. As people get older, their taste changes. The natural gravitation is from Radio 1 to Radio 2, and this is the way it should be. </p> <p>The mystery for the austere Today programme listener is why anyone would want to listen either to Terry Wogan or Chris Moyles at all. Both men pull in more than seven million listeners a week, though the latest Rajar figures give Wogan the distinct advantage: up 60,000 on this time last year, while Moyles's show was down for the second consecutive quarter. Neither, after all, does much more than provide inconsequential wittering to anaesthetise the listener while he or she prepares for work. You are not meant to listen all that attentively to breakfast radio. As a radio critic, I once made the mistake of examining Terry Wogan's technique and ended up in despair that such a seasoned pro could actually sound so amateur. (Pauses, chuckling at his own jokes, utterly lame remarks - well, of course, this is the point.) Wogan did me the honour, I was told, of insulting me on air. </p> <p>Moyles, though, has a larger cast on his show and the wittering can go on for quite some time. On last Friday's show you would have had to wait a full 20 minutes after it started before a song was played. This technique might have served him well in the past but it can get on the nerves, unless you will yourself into a state of calm. </p> <p>The thing is that the great DJs are not at their best in the mornings. Can you imagine John Peel or Bob Dylan (his Theme Time Radio Hour being one of the wonders of the medium) doing a morning slot? When Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley took over the Radio 1 breakfast slot, they seemed to set a new benchmark as to how fast a station could lose listeners. And they were a great team. </p> <p>So perhaps another reason Moyles's audience is shrinking is that he's actually getting better. Which is, in itself, a frightening thought.<br><strong>Nicholas Lezard</strong></p> <h2>Do over-30s make better parents?</h2> <p>Apparently, yes - or at least, that's what the Millennium Cohort Study suggests. It is charting the lives of 15,000 families, and this week it reported that children whose parents were over 30 at the time of their birth tended to be brighter, healthier and less likely to have behavioural difficulties.</p> <p>But is it really having parents aged 30-plus that brings advantages, or is this research more to do with the fact that middle-class parents - whose offspring tend to do better - are more likely to wait until later to have their children? The report's director, professor Heather Joshi at the University of London, says it's probably a bit of both: being middle-class does definitely give children an advantage, and the middle classes do tend to wait to start their families. </p> <p>But separate the class bias out of the equation, and the likelihood is there are benefits, whatever your background, to waiting to breed. \"As you move through your 20s into your 30s, you do acquire all sorts of assets that could prepare you to be a parent,\" says Joshi. \"You pick up a lot of life skills that could help in raising children.\" You're also, she points out, likely to be better off and in better housing - and that's as true if you're working-class as if you're middle-class.</p> <p>Over recent decades the trend towards later parenting has been marked - in 1971 the average age of women having a first baby was 23.6, rising to 25.7 in 1991 and 27.6 in 2006. But these figures have been boosted by an especially strong trend among middle-class, university-educated women to wait until their late 30s or even early 40s to have a first baby. And while later parenting does seem to confer advantages, there has to be what Joshi calls a \"watershed age\" at which parents have accumulated enough life skills and material advantages, but are still young and fit enough to be able to cope with the demands of young kids. </p> <p>\"After all,\" says Joshi, \"athletes peak in their early 20s, and parenting is physically demanding as well. It doesn't all cut one way.\"<br><strong>Joanna Moorhead</strong></p>",
  "<p>A grey October's afternoon in Manchester, the grinding routine of training is over for another day and Micah Richards is playing a game that everyone connected with his football club has probably had a go at over the last few weeks - the which-player-would-we-like-next game. Ronaldo or Ronaldinho? Kaka or Messi? Villa or Torres? It is a long list of the super-rich and super-talented and Richards, eyes sparkling, needs a few seconds to make up his mind. \"Thierry Henry,\" he eventually announces. \"That's one cool dude.\"</p> <p>The stuff of fantasy? Maybe, maybe not. There is so much money swilling around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a> these days it would not be the biggest shock in the world. On the flipside it could also be argued that the club's young English footballers should be watching with as much concern as awe. Yet Richards, alone, should ensure Mark Hughes never has to field a team made up exclusively of foreign players. Among the Brazilians and other assorted nationalities it is inconceivable that there will be no place for the boy from inner-city Leeds who played his first game for England at the age of 18 and 144 days and had Sir Bobby Robson talking of him becoming \"our best defender since Bobby Moore\".</p> <p>Richards himself is engaging company - polite, generous with his time and happy to talk despite an image for being reluctant to do interviews. He is understandably excited about City's future and there is a boyish innocence when he talks of playing alongside Robinho, the club's showpiece signing. \"One of my mates heard before me,\" he recalls. \"He rang me to say, 'We've signed Robinho.' I just went, 'Yeah, whatever . . .' I mean, he's the sort of player you would usually only pick for City in a computer game.\"</p> <p>Robinho, he reports, has quickly won over his new team-mates. \"When he turned up for his first day it was really weird for everyone,\" says Richards. \"It needed a week before we could get our heads around it and stop staring. But he's just one of the boys now. Coming from Real Madrid, we were all thinking, 'What's he going to be like? Is he going to be a superstar? Up his own arse?' But he's a really nice lad. He went around the dressing room and shook hands with everyone and he speaks a lot better English than we imagined.\"</p> <p>The beauty of City's new-found wealth is that Robinho is just the first of many \u00a330m-plus signings. The plan, in case anybody in the sporting world is not yet aware, is global domination and, even though Richards warns \"it will not happen overnight\", he is confident the club can win the Premier League within three years. \"We could probably go out and get another 10 superstars in January,\" he points out.</p> <p>These, however, are strange times for Richards and the smile disappears as he contemplates how, almost unnoticed in the Michael Owen debate, his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England </a>career appears to have stalled. He has not played a single minute since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fabio-capello\">Fabio Capello's</a> appointment and admits to being \"frustrated\" as he tries to find a reason. \"I'd played 11 games, been constantly hyped in the media and I thought I had a good chance of keeping my place. Then I got an injury and ever since then I don't know why it is, but I can't get back in. I do believe I should be in the squad.\" </p> <p>That last sentence should not be construed as arrogance. Richards simply belongs to that new breed of footballer who is supremely confident, with his snazzy designer gear and tram lines shaved into his eyebrows. He has been called cocky; in reality he is just full of proud self-belief and strong of mind, a useful trait for any sportsman and something that can be traced back to his upbringing in Chapeltown, an unloved district of Leeds synonymous with the Yorkshire Ripper murders, social deprivation and crime.</p> <p>\"It was hard growing up there,\" says Richards. \"There was a lot of drugs and gun-shooting. But my dad [Lincoln] was always by my side and because I always played football I didn't get involved in the drug scene and all the other kinds of stuff. I saw it all and I knew what was happening but I never went down that road.\"</p> <p>Lincoln, a dreadlocked Rastafarian, moved to England from St Kitts in the 60s. \"I wasn't always as disciplined as I should have been and I'm not going to lie - there were times when I was younger and did things that I shouldn't have,\" says Richards. \"My dad knew what the area was like and he would say to me, \"You've got the opportunity to make something good of yourself - don't screw it up by doing something stupid.' I listened to his advice and that's why I'm here today.\"</p> <p>His journey took him via Leeds United, who failed to recognise his potential and let him go. Oldham Athletic picked up the pieces and signed him on schoolboy forms, and it was not long before City got wind of his talent.</p> <p>There is a tragic twist. While Richards dedicated himself to becoming a professional, a parallel can be drawn with another of the talented young players from Chapeltown. Daniel Nelson grew up on a nearby street and shared Richards's expectation to make a career out of football. Then he fell in with the wrong crowd and slipped out of the game. By the time Richards made his debut for City, Nelson had hanged himself in prison while facing drug charges. \"We were good friends and we grew up playing football together,\" says Richards. \"It was just a horrible waste of life - a mate of mine who had been in the same team as me. I can still remember finding out and how upsetting it was. I guess he felt he had no other option but to end his life. It just shows what can happen if you are not focused.\" </p> <p>There were other evils, too. At the age of 12, playing for Leeds City Boys, Richards was bewildered by the loud grunts when the ball came near him. \"After a few seconds I realised they were monkey noises,\" he says. \"It wasn't just the boys but their parents as well. There were mums and dads around the pitch and they were joining in.\"</p> <p>Eight years on Richards is an ambassador for Kick It Out and, though he has no desire to be seen as a crusader or political campaigner, he does admit to being dismayed by the \u00a314,920 fine that Fifa imposed on Croatia for the racist abuse suffered by Emile Heskey during England's game in Zagreb. \"I don't think it is acceptable,\" he says. \"In this day and age that kind of money is pigeon-feed. I'm realistic and I know my opinion is not going to change anything. But if a crowd is making racist chants, I think the authorities should just ban them, end of story.\"</p> <p>Does he agree with the Football Association's insistence that England's friendly against Spain is not played at the Bernab\u00e9u, the stadium where Ashley Cole and Shaun Wright-Phillips were targeted in 2004? \"I wouldn't make that condition because it makes it look like they [the racists] have won. It's a nice gesture from the FA because they obviously don't want our players to hear those chants again. </p> <p>But it defeats the object. We should go over to Madrid, play the match there and, if there is racist behaviour, Spain should be banned.\"</p> <p>The game is on February 11 and by then Richards, now 20, hopes to have convinced Capello to resurrect his England career. Time is on his side - and it is worth remembering that when he broke into the team he was young enough to be still living in digs. \"That was the really weird thing,\" he says. \"I didn't have my own house and shared a place in Stockport with Karl Moore, who's at Millwall now. When I got the call to say I was in the squad I just thought it was one of the other academy lads winding me up. But when I got my first cap I wanted my second and third. And that's what it's like now.\" Richards' time will surely come again.</p> <h2>Kick It Out plans 1,000 events over next 10 days</h2> <p>Young, black and successful, it is easy to understand why Kick It Out considers Micah Richards as the type of footballer it wants to promote its campaign. The organisation's 2008 week of action began on Thursday and there will be awareness events across the country at this weekend's fixtures.</p> <p>\"Micah is one of our most high-profile ambassadors and he's also one of the youngest players involved with us,\" Danny Lynch, the Kick It Out spokesman, said at the launch of the annual One Game, One Community event. \"Player support like this is absolutely vital to the continuing success of our campaign.\"</p> <p>There will be more than 1,000 events over the next 10 days, with all 92 clubs in England's top four divisions holding their own anti-racism programme. As well as racial prejudice and anti-Semitism, the topics will include the problem of homophobia, the lack of British-Asian professionals in the game and the difficulties that disabled fans encounter at stadiums.</p> <p>\"It's an opportunity to highlight our work at every level of the game,\" says Lord Herman Ouseley, chairman of Kick It Out. \"It's a time to celebrate the diversity football offers.\"</p> <p>Paul Ince, who made history this season by becoming the Premier League's first British-born black manager, has joined Richards in supporting the campaign. \"Being a part of the weeks of action is an honour for me,\" said the Blackburn Rovers manager. \"Kick It Out has been pivotal in fighting discrimination in the English game.\"</p> <p>Other ambassadors include Park Ji-sung (Manchester United), Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea), Ledley King (Tottenham Hotspur) and Freddy Eastwood (Coventry City).</p> <p>Richards has represented City for the past two seasons. \"I haven't experienced any form of racism in the Premier League but I know it does happen in some places abroad and it isn't going to go away overnight,\" he says. </p> <p>\"As a black person I know what it is like to be on the receiving end. I've heard monkey noises and it's hurtful and upsetting. Players shouldn't be judged on the colour of their skin. Everyone should be equal and that's the message Kick It Out wants to get across.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zombies. I've always loved zombies. Not literally - I'm not a necrophile, not yet anyway - but I've always loved watching them. In my view they beat all other screen monsters hands down. Ghosts? No thanks. Only an imbecile would believe in them anyway. You might as well be frightened of unicorns. Freddy Krueger? A bad stand-up comic with Swiss Army hands. Werewolves? Supergrass in a bad mood. Serial killers? The only decent ones are Tony Curtis in The Boston Strangler and Kevin Spacey in Se7en (and he was playing a deranged artist, not a serial killer per se). And since Silence Of The Lambs, it's been the law that all serial killers must be depicted as sophisticated cop-outwitting geniuses who'd be more at home being the controller of Radio 3 than slicing someone's kneecap off in an abandoned warehouse. Real serial killers are so mental they can scarcely tie their own shoelaces. So bollocks to the screen version.</p> <p>And don't even think about mentioning vampires, with their gothic pretension and crappy teeth. They're annoying, not scary. Fuck vampires.</p> <p>But zombies - now there's a threat I can relate to. Zombies are the misanthrope's monster of choice. They represent fear and disgust of our fellow man. The anonymous animal masses. The dumb, shuffling crowd. Them - the public. They're awesomely stupid. They have an IQ of one. Proper zombies can't operate a door handle or climb a ladder. Toss one a Rubik's Cube and it'll bounce off his thick, moaning head. All they do is walk around aimlessly, pausing occasionally to eat survivors.</p> <p>Except they don't walk these days. They run. Zombies started jogging in 2002, when 28 Days Later came out. OK, so technically they weren't zombies in that movie - being still alive, albeit infected - but from that point on it was difficult to return to the old-school shambling George Romero zombies of yore. They're dumb and they can run? Brilliant.</p> <p>The idea for my TV show Dead Set (in which zombies attack the Big Brother house) came about one night in 2004 while I was watching 24. Jack Bauer was performing a tracheotomy on a terrorist with a splintered peg or something, and another terrorist came running through the door. \"I'm enjoying this,\" I thought, \"but these terrorists are just ridiculous. They're like waves of Space Invaders. They might as well be zombies.\"</p> <p>At the time, Shaun Of The Dead and the Dawn Of The Dead remake were about to come out. Zombies were clearly \"in the ether\", so I figured it would only be a matter of time before the US made some epic big-budget TV series about the undead. But they didn't, the idiots.</p> <p>Time passed. And then one night I was watching Big Brother when another thought struck me. All zombie movies eventually boil down to a siege situation. What better place to hide than a fortified house thronged with cameras? Every person in the country must've fantasised at some point about what would happen if some terrible apocalypse occurred during a run of Big Brother, leaving the contestants oblivious. So that would be the starting point.</p> <p>At the time, I had no idea just how long it can take to get a project this daft and huge on to TV. Sadly you can't just think things on to the screen. It takes ages. Suffice to say the first draft was written back when Derek Laud, Science, Maxwell and Saskia were the housemates du jour. After that, the project was repeatedly killed off, resurrected, killed again, dragged back to life... and finally, somehow, written, shot, edited and produced.</p> <p>My involvement is, if anything, a bit of a red herring. For one thing, it's a huge team effort requiring the input and imagination of hundreds of people, all working their arses off. And, for another, I'm known for championing series like The Wire. Dead Set very much isn't The Wire; instead, it's unashamed populist schlock. Warped and disgusting populist schlock, I hope, but shlock nonetheless.</p> <p>We wanted to make something that die-hard zombie fans like myself would love, see. Hopefully we've pulled it off. Throughout the series there are little winks and nods in the direction of various zombie classics, all of which I spent hours rewatching when I was supposed to be writing. And make no mistake - it's grisly. Obviously there's a lot of comedy in there too (just look at the setting), but we were keen from the start to differentiate Dead Set from Shaun Of The Dead. I loved Shaun Of The Dead, but that's a comedy first and a horror movie second; ours would be the other way round. We aimed for a tone closer to American Werewolf In London. Bleak but preposterous. And is it a satire?</p> <p>Yes and no. Primarily it's a romp. Still, you be the judge.</p> <p>Also: I wanted to try and strongarm a bit of proper horror back on to TV. Telly used to be nasty. Hammer House of Horror, Tales Of The Unexpected, The Twilight Zone: these shows were often shockingly cruel, and I loved them for it. Apart from the news, practically the only show doing effective horror in recent years has been Doctor Who (the episode Blink in particular being a mini-masterpiece just as scary as the movie Ring). Most shows are inherently cosy and reassuring. Or they're set in a fucking hospital and are therefore intrinsically boring. We wanted to redress the balance. We're nasty.</p> <p>If nothing else, Dead Set should set some new benchmark (or low point, depending on your point of view) for onscreen gore. There's a particularly explicit bit of skull-smashing in episode one, but that's nothing compared to what happens later. There's no point making a 15-certificate zombie flick. Money shots, that's what you want. And that's what you'll get. I sincerely hope some of you vomit.</p> <p>Anyway, I've only had one real disappointment: I wanted a zombie cameo. And I got one, but not as a \"featured\" zombie. They tried putting the white contact lenses in but my eyes are too buggy and weird. Every time I blinked, they came off. So I'm only on screen for a nanosecond, in the dark. They gave me a nice neck wound, though.</p> <p>\u2022 Dead Set, Mon 27 to Oct 31, 10pm, E4; the DVD is out Nov 3 </p> <h2>Spawn of the dead</h2> <p>Dead Set was inspired by about a billion other zombie movies.

Dawn Of The Dead is the greatest splatter movie ever made.</p> <p><strong>Zombie Flesh Eaters (1980)</strong></p> <p>The film that made Italian director Lucio Fulci a legend among the sort of crowd that like to watch people getting their eyes gouged out with wooden splinters for no good reason.

Its magazine held commercially manufactured ammunition, rather than \"homemade\" bullets - something often seen by detectives - and the ageing weapon was probably purchased for between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The trail left by the firearm can be reported following the life sentences handed down yesterday to two street gangsters for murder.</p> <p>It was discovered on a November morning in 2006 when a teenage boy set off for school telling his mother not to look in his room. </p> <p>Whether it was something in his tone, or just a mother's instinct, she ignored him. In his bedroom he kept a toy safe for his belongings, and inside she found the gun. She called the police and the firearm was taken away to a forensics laboratory where it was identified as a CZ .32 Colt Model 1927, manufactured by Ceska Zbrojovka of Strakonice, Czechoslovakia. </p> <p>The gun was loaded, with three live rounds in the magazine. A bullet was lodged in the barrel.</p> <p>A few weeks later Detective Inspector Dave Manning, of the Metropolitan police's Trident unit, received a telephone call. After more than eight months investigating the murder of a notorious drug dealer, killer and kidnapper called Andrew Wanogho, he had all but given up on receiving such a contact.</p> <p>His inquiry was fraught with difficulties. At 26, the victim was running a syndicate of teenage armed robbers who would also do his drug running. Shortly before his murder Wanogho complained to the woman he called his \"baby mother\" - the mother of his child - that he did not have a friend left in the world.</p> <p>His killing was, on the face of it, just another inner city gangland shooting; the sort officers from Trident deal with all the time but which pass almost un-noticed by the media.</p> <p>But this inquiry opened a window on to a criminal subculture which exists cheek by jowl with ordinary families in ordinary neighbourhoods; the class A drug dealing, the incredible reach of the criminal networks, the threatening and taking of lives, the kidnappings, sexual violence, extortion and witness intimidation. </p> <p>And at the heart of it all, the tool used to enforce and protect: the gun.</p> <p>Wanogho, known as Sparks, was a powerful amateur boxer who had fought successfully in the United States. Held in awe and fear in equal measure by his peers, he was seen as a protector by some but a mercurial and extremely violent man by others. </p> <p>A Pentecostal pastor described to the 350 people at his funeral in Brockley, south London, how he would push his disabled brother to church each week in a wheelchair. Less was said of his history of violence. </p> <p>\"He was a formidable boxer and would beat people to a pulp and get pleasure out of it,\" said one source. </p> <p>He once kidnapped and tortured a bus driver whose brother was a rival drug dealer. </p> <p>The man was driven to a flat and chained to a radiator before Wanogho held a hot iron against his face. It was all done to intimidate the man's brother into giving up his drug stash. Four years before his murder Wanogho was charged with the murder of a man shot dead outside an east London nightclub. He escaped conviction after two witnesses withdrew their evidence because they were in fear of their lives.</p> <p>In August 2005, Wanogho survived an assassination attempt as he left a courtroom where he had watched a girlfriend plead guilty to possession of one of his guns in order to save him from jail. Eight months later he was not so lucky.</p> <p>Manning was convinced the hit on Wanogho in April 2006 had been organised by an inmate at HMP Belmarsh on a mobile phone that was smuggled into the prison system and which, investigations revealed, had made 17,000 calls in seven months. </p> <p>But facing a wall of silence, Trident officers spent months scanning thousands of pages of mobile records until a pattern emerged. The inmate, Delphon Nicholas, had made a flurry of calls in the hours before the killing to his best friend, a gunman, rapist and drug trafficker called Trevor Dennie.</p> <p>Both men had fallen out with Wanogho over drugs and women and Dennie was heard telling a friend: \"I've had enough of Andy, he's gone too far. He's barred from the ends.\" </p> <p>At 1.30am on April 8 2006 Wanogho stepped out of a car outside the home of Nicholas's former girlfriend. </p> <p>He told Sean Albert, who had driven him, that he was \"up for a bit of a shagging\".</p> <p>Albert drove a discreet distance away to wait until he was called again. But Dennie was lying in wait and as Albert pulled up a few houses down the road he heard a series of gun shots in rapid succession. </p> <p>He looked in his rear view mirror and saw Wanogho, head down, sprinting towards him. But just as he reached the car he crumpled to the ground, hit in the back by a bullet that pierced his heart. </p> <p>On Wanogho's body police found the incongruous possessions of a Class A drug dealer and gangster - a \u00a317,000 diamond encrusted Cartier watch and \u00a31.11 in cash. They also recovered two of the four bullets fired, including one that had ricocheted off a parked car and landed in a front garden.</p> <p>The closest they got to the gun, however, was a witness who described seeing Dennie brandishing it over his head at an east London nightclub a few hours later and boasting that he had killed Wanogho.</p> <p>Eight months on Manning was told that the gun found in a 14-year-old boy's bedroom was his murder weapon. Somehow it had passed from Dennie through several hands to being stored by the boy on the orders of an older hood, probably as some kind of initiation rite. Ballistics tests showed that the .32 caliber handgun had been used in at least seven shootings in less than two years, six in south London and one in Sussex.</p> <p>On New Year's Eve in 2004 a police officer was responding to a 999 call from a victim of a robbery in Brockley Cross, in the heart of what Dennie described as his \"manor\". He arrived to find three men nearby, and as he walked up to speak to them, the trio ran. But one man turned, pulled a gun and shot at the constable as he fled.</p> <p>This time the bullet missed its target. Police made inquiries but never made any headway. No arrests were made and the firearm disappeared back into the shadows.</p> <p>It emerged 10 months later at the Cube nightclub in Camberwell Green, south London, in a petty dispute. The victim happened to bump into a man as he went to the toilet and was shot in the thigh for his clumsiness.</p> <p>In April 2006 the handgun reached its zenith with the murder of Wanogho, leaving a bullet lodged in his heart and two others at the scene which provided the vital link. Three weeks after the murder the firearm emerged once more at M-Blax nightclub in Peckham. At around 5.40am in the final hour of clubbing, a group of young men from a north London gang burst into the venue carrying weapons, intent on shooting up their south London rivals. </p> <p>Clubbers screamed and ran as a gunfight broke out in the crowded club. At least 21 shots were fired and three men were taken to hospital. Cartridges found at the scene matched the firearm found in the boy's bedroom.</p> <p>By June 2006 the gun had been passed on or stolen once more, its value by now diminished because of its use in a murder. It appeared again at the unlikely venue of Pontins in Camber Sands, when a group of teenagers from the capital travelled to the Sussex holiday camp for an urban music weekend. </p> <p>Large crowds gathered on the Sunday at the main hip hop stage, but in the midst off the rave the sound of gunshots sent young people running for cover. By the time local police arrived with firearms teams the elusive weapon had melted away into the background once more.</p> <p>A month later it was back in south London again, when shots were fired at a car. The gun was probably last used in the autumn of 2006 when it was accidentally fired by a would-be gangster.</p> <p>In the remaining four weeks of its criminal life the firearm was passed into the hands of the teenage boy, who according to sources, was bullied by the hoods because he suffered from Asperger's syndrome.</p> <p>It provided a forensic treasure trove. \"It is quite rare to recover guns at all, so to recover a weapon that is linked to seven shootings is unusual,\" said Manning. \"Everyone talks about guns being available on street corners, but it's not quite as easy as that to get hold of one. It's even more difficult to get hold of real ammunition.\"</p> <p>The boy's experience gave credence to anecdotal evidence that criminals are forcing younger boys to store their guns to test their mettle and once the gun was found the teenager was said to be terrified of repercussions. But his mother's actions in calling the police perhaps saved him from being sucked into a life of crime.</p> <p>Nicholas and Dennie began life sentences for the murder of Wanogho yesterday, closing the final chapter on the story of a gun that ended the life of one veteran gangster before initiating a young boy to follow in his footsteps.</p> <h2>History of gun crime</h2> <p>Intelligence on how many illegal firearms are in use on Britain's streets is limited and sometimes <strong>contradictory</strong>. Senior officers believe that weapons are often rented out and are therefore linked to multiple offences but in recent times there has been an influx of weapons from eastern Europe, particularly the Russian made <strong>9mm</strong> <strong>Baikal</strong>, a self defence pistol used for firing CS gas which is converted to carry real bullets in factories in Lithuania.</p> <p>Sources close to the new <strong>National Ballistics Intelligence Service</strong>, which contains intelligence and ballistic reports on every recovered illegal firearm, say at least 250 Baikals have been recovered in the last two years. But at around <strong>\u00a32,500 on the street</strong>, the Russian pistol is out of reach for some members of urban gangs. Many of the weapons held in the NBIS armory are pre-war semi automatic pistols, which despite their <strong>decrepit</strong> state have still killed and wounded. It is these type of weapons - which can be bought for a few hundred pounds - that are often used by young men in <strong>London</strong>, <strong>Manchester</strong>, and <strong>Liverpool</strong>. In Manchester, where certain areas are not penetrated by police, getting hold of a gun is easier than in London. </p> <p>Home Office data shows gun crime is up since last year, despite the doubling of the sentence, to a five year minimum, for possessing or supplying firearms. </p> <p>The last three years have seen the ages of those carrying and using weapons fall dramatically from around 27 to 16 and 17 year olds. A 13-year-old boy became the <strong>youngest </strong>to be charged with possession of a firearm this year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008. Homophone corner: \"The boy's experience gave credence to anecdotal evidence that criminals are forcing younger boys to store their guns to test their metal ... \". This has been corrected.</p>",

Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A 23-year-old who played rugby for England as a teenager has committed suicide in a Swiss euthanasia clinic after having become paralysed from the chest down in a training accident. Police are investigating.</p> <p>Nuneaton rugby club hooker Daniel James felt his body had become a \"prison\" and lived in \"fear and loathing\" of his daily life, his parents said last night, having accompanied him to Switzerland from their home in Sinton Green, near Worcester. He had attempted to kill himself several times since March 2007 when a scrum had collapsed on him and dislocated his neck vertebrae, trapping his spinal cord and rendering him immediately tetraplegic.</p> <p>West Mercia Police have begun an investigation into his assisted suicide, which took place on September 12. Details were made public yesterday when police published a statement relating to an inquest in progress. Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK, and family or friends who help face up to 14 years in jail. Officers have questioned a man and a women in the case and are preparing to submit a report to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>James' parents, Mark and Julie, said last night that their son had been \"an intelligent young man of sound mind\" and \"not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence\".</p> <p>He is one of the youngest Britons to have travelled abroad for assisted suicide. Earlier this month, Dignitas, the centre for assisted dying in Zurich, said that 100 Britons have travelled to Switzerland to make use of its more liberal laws. It is thought James attended a clinic in Berne.</p> <p>James was a talented player who seemed destined for a professional career. He played for England at under-16 level and went on to play for Loughborough University, where he was an engineering undergraduate. The training accident happened four days after he helped England Students beat a France side in Oxford.</p> <p>In a training session for forwards, he was practising a scrum when the pack came crashing down. Under their weight, he dislocated bones in his neck and trapped the spinal cord.</p> <p>In the following weeks he had several operations and spent eight months in rehabilitation, including a stay at Stoke Mandeville hospital, before returning home; he only ever regained a small amount of use in his fingers. Early last month he travelled to Switzerland. His funeral took place in the UK on October 1.</p> <p>\"His death was an extremely sad loss for his family, friends and all those that cared for him, but no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become and the day to day fear and loathing of his living existence,\" the James family solicitors said last night. \"This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end, but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed, and some say determined young man.\" </p> <p>Yesterday the Spinal Injuries Association expressed shock. \"When someone has an injury like this, you think its the end of the world as life is going to change for ever,\" said Daniel Burden, head of public affairs. \"But our mantra is that life need not end if you are paralysed. We know of people with similar or worse injuries than Dan who have lived fulfilling lives.\"</p> <p>The case comes as Debbie Purdy, 45, who has primary progressive multiple sclerosis, awaits a high court judgement seeking clarification of the legal status of family and friends who accompany people who commit assisted suicide. </p> <p>Her action is being supported by Dignity in Dying, which campaigns for a law change to allow terminally ill and mentally competent patients to choose assisted death in the UK. James, who was not terminally ill, would not have been eligible under any such alteration of the law. </p> <p>Prior to his death, James's uncle, Mark Roebuck, who started The Dan James Trust which raised nearly \u00a325,000 for spinal research, paid tribute to his nephew.</p> <p>\"On Monday March 12 2007 Dan was just like thousands of 23-year-olds, full of life, hope, excitement and dreams. Whatever he chose to do, he would have done it with the good humour and lovely nature that made him a lovable young man.\"</p> <p>The message boards on Nuneaton rugby club's website carried tributes yesterday. \"This is really sad and tragic news, and it makes all the silly arguments with the rugby and football club very trivial and unimportant,\" said Nutty Nun. \"My thoughts, sympathy and prayers are with Dan's family. RIP Dan.\"</p> <h2> Forbidden by law </h2> <p>Although suicide is no longer a crime in England and Wales, it is still an offence under the Suicide Act 1961 to \"aid, counsel or procure the suicide of another\"; the penalty is up to 14 years' imprisonment, and there have been 12 prosecutions since 2005.</p> <p>The only jurisdictions where assisted suicide is not illegal are Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the state of Oregon in the US. </p> <p>Although Swiss law does not specifically permit assisted suicide or provide any details about how it can be done legally, it does not prohibit it either. Several clinics have been established, providing facilities for terminally ill people to commit suicide, including Dignitas in Berne, the only clinic which offers its services to people not living in Switzerland. Since it opened in 1998 it has helped 868 people to end their lives, 100 of them from the UK.</p> <p>Dignitas's motto is \"to live with dignity - to die with dignity\". It offers a service to the terminally ill and their families including accommodation, access to doctors and a dose of a drug causing a deep coma and painless death. However, anyone who accompanies a relative to Dignitas risks prosecution on their return for assisting suicide contrary to English law.</p> <p><strong>Afua Hirsch</strong></p>",
  "<p>The novelty factor may have worn off but the romance between Parisians and le V\u00e9lib continues. Back from their long summer holidays, 215,000 of my fellow Parisians have renewed their annual subscription to the city-wide bicycle scheme. These, together with other occasional cyclists, such as tourists, make up the 100,000 daily rentals. Needless to say, the scheme is a \"succ\u00e8s formidable\".</p> <p>Young entrepreneurs have turned the V\u00e9lib into businesses, organising paid-for V\u00e9lib tours for American tourists in the Latin quarter. You can spot the riding hordes with their red jackets on, led by a lean Parisian student in a yellow vest. For those who prefer to go at their own pace, we thought the time right to devise a Guardian V\u00e9lib tour. One which will take you from the world's oldest and biggest flea markets of St-Ouen to those of Vanves. This three-hour \"mini tour de Paris\" with its ups (to Montmartre) and downs (from Montmartre it's downhill all the way) includes, bien-s\u00fbr, bistro and cafe stops. It's a north-south 15km ride that is best enjoyed on the weekend when the flea markets are lively with jazz bands, and the Paris street traffic is at its quietest.</p> <p>In a few weeks, St-Ouen, like another 30 surrounding suburbs of Paris, will be equipped with V\u00e9lib stations, but until then, let's go to the V\u00e9lib dock station at Porte de Montmartre. Always choose a bike with a straight saddle (a saddle tilted backwards means it needs repairing), check your tyres, light and brakes, and adjust the saddle to your height, making sure it's not loose: I remember one epic ride with the saddle turning on its base like a weather vane. </p> <p>My favourite route starts with a cycling fl\u00e2nerie through the streets of St-Ouen that bear revolutionaries' names (the area has had communist mayors for a century). In St-Ouen, the urban landscape changes drastically from that of bourgeois Paris: low-rise 19th-century red brick factories and typical tiny 1930s workers' houses. St-Ouen wouldn't be the same, of course, without its many flea markets spread either side of rue des Rosiers: march\u00e9s Paul Bert, Biron, Dauphine and Vernaison, to name but a few, have attracted junk fetishists like me since 1885. And the great thing about the V\u00e9lib is that it has a basket which can hold anything up to the size of a cabin suitcase: very useful for that 1930s Bakelite hairdryer. </p> <p>At the weekend, I often stop at <strong>La Chope des Puces</strong> (point 1 on map) for live jazz (122 rue des Rosiers, +1 40 11 02 49; jazz every Saturday and Sunday, 2pm-7pm) and the bistro<strong> Paul Bert</strong> (point 2) for a p\u00e2t\u00e9 sandwich (20 rue Paul Bert, +1 40 11 90 28). The waiter there is always grumpy; it's part of the folklore.</p> <p>From St-Ouen, I usually cycle through Porte de Clignancourt, with its French West Indies locals living in 1930s council estates, and ride up, up, up rue Hermel where the view over the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur gives me just enough strength to keep going. My favourite 18th-arrondissement street is rue Lamarck, a winding road of blond stone Haussmannian buildings encasing the Montmartre hill like a snake. I always think of the chanteuse Edith Piaf, who often stopped at <strong>Le Relais Bistro </strong> (point 3) (48 rue Lamarck, +1 42 64 04 17). As a child I couldn't understand why people preferred Notre Dame to Sacr\u00e9 Coeur - to me there was nothing more beautiful than this big choux \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me.</p> <p>In Montmartre, the best bit comes when you suddenly realise that from there on, it's all downhill. Among my favourite stops in the descent is the leafy square sheltering the artists' cafe, <strong>Le Botak</strong> (point 4) (1 rue Paul Albert, +1 46 06 98 30). At the bottom of the hill, boulevard Rochechouart reminds the innocent cyclist that in Paris, the sex industry and romance are often intertwined: throngs of tourists come here to ogle Pigalle's sex shops and buy a ticket to Le Moulin Rouge's evening spectacles.</p> <p>Time to leave the 18th arrondissement and cycle through the aristocratic 9th with its private cul-de-sacs and art nouveau squares such as place St Georges, a wonder of architecture best admired from the cafe <strong>A la Place St Georges</strong> (point 5) (60 rue St Georges, +1 42 80 39 32). In comparison, the 10th arrondissement feels very industrious, with its narrow streets and delivery vans. I always marvel at 48 rue des Petites-Ecuries which displays some of the most beautiful caryatids to be seen in Paris. The ride through rue St-Denis (the street may be one-way but cyclists are allowed to ride southward) is the best advert for little-known multicultural Paris with Asian, Vietnamese, Algerian and Turkish street vendors cohabiting with madames waiting for clients on their buildings' doorsteps. St-Denis is, after all, the original haunt of Parisian prostitutes.</p> <p>Across the Seine lies the Latin quarter and its bookish feel. No delivery vans, no prostitutes, just handsome students and their professors. These days, I stop at the <strong>Caf\u00e9 Le Rostand </strong> (point 6) (6 place Edmond-Rostand, +1 43 54 61 58), just to check on the last French intellectuals. The final leg of the journey is a very pleasant affair, cycling through the 14th arrondissement and its many colourful markets. And here you are, in Porte de Vanves, where antique and vintage clothes dealers have set up their stalls along avenue Marc Sangnier. Let's find ourselves another classy bargain - using the money saved on the guided tour.</p> <h2>Follow our step-by-step guide to the route</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338730501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/10/17/PARIS-MAP.gif\" alt=\"PARIS-MAP.gif\" width=\"470\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Start at the V\u00e9lib station on Rue Ren\u00e9 Binet in the 18th arrondisement </p> <p>Turn right into Avenue de la Porte de Montmartre</p> <p>Pass under p\u00e9riph\u00e9rique (physical frontier of Paris)</p> <p>You're now in St Ouen</p> <p>Turn right into Rue Neuve Pierre Curie</p> <p>Left into Rue Lecuyer</p> <p>Right into Rue Plaisir</p> <p>Left into Rue des Bons Enfants</p> <p>Right into Rue Louis Dain</p> <p>Right into Rue des rosiers</p> <p>Puces de St Ouen</p> <p>To P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, pass under.

  "<p>Normally, it would have been a dire week. Inflation rose to a 16-year high of 5.2%, the jobless total hit its highest level in 17 years and there was gloomy news from the high street and the housing market. The US was in equally bad shape. Consumer confidence, according to figures out yesterday, suffered its sharpest ever one-month fall last month as the public digested the implications of a month of mayhem on Wall Street.</p> <p>But these are not normal times and in London, Washington, Paris and Berlin last night there was a sense that the week could have been much worse; in fact, that the world was back from the abyss.</p> <p>When Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF, warned last Saturday that the world's financial system was \"on the brink of systemic meltdown\" he was voicing the views of every central bank governor and finance minister attending the gloomiest and most crucial meeting of the fund for a generation. </p> <p>The talk in the corridors of the IMF was of what could be done before markets opened on Monday morning to prevent the collapse of the western banking system and a descent into a 1930s-style slump. The emergency package hammered out first in Washington and then in Paris averted the catastrophe. Markets remain nervous, share prices have moved up and down, the mood in the City and on Wall Street has remained downbeat as traders have woken up to the notion that the global economy is heading for recession - and probably a big one at that.</p> <p>But Lord Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, spoke for many this week when he said last weekend would prove \"a watershed\". Contingency plans were put in place last week for the apocalyptic scenario. The reason Alistair Darling, the chancellor, and Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, will sleep easier this weekend is that catastrophe has been averted. For now the sense of relief goes no deeper than that.</p> <p>Last Friday was a day of blind panic on the London stock exchange. Bank shares were hammered, with Royal Bank of Scotland losing a quarter of its stock market value. The Edinburgh-based bank was worth almost \u00a360bn a year ago, but as the City closed for business it was valued at just \u00a311.5bn.</p> <p>It was clear to the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA that the banking crisis had not been solved by Darling's announcement two days earlier of a grand bail-out. By last Friday, febrile markets were searching for details on which banks would need capital and how much.</p> <p>The Treasury and the FSA summoned the banks to find a solution before the markets opened on Monday. It was not just bankers who spent a weekend locked away. Lawyers, accountants and top City investors were all engaged in a frantic attempt to end the uncertainty and put an amount on the capital cushions that the banks would need appease regulators worried about the strength of the system.</p> <p>The mood was bleak. So were some of the contingency plans being considered by the authorities to ensure some of calm could return on Monday. Darling had been at the IMF on Friday but left the meetings early to deal with the crisis at home. A number of contingencies were discussed, with consideration given to suspending stock markets.</p> <p>In London \u00a3250bn had been wiped off the value of the top 100 shares in the previous week. The fear was that the market would go into a fatal spiral if fears about the strength of the major banks could not be abated before Monday morning.</p> <p>Even if stockmarkets did not need to be closed discussions were held about halting trading in bank shares which had been dragging the wider markets lower. Consideration was also given to calling an emergency bank holiday, such was the anxiety about how bank customers would respond to further falls in share prices of the banks holding their savings.</p> <p>While cash machines would have probably kept dispensing money, banks would have closed their doors for the day to give themselves a breathing space.</p> <p>In the event, such drastic steps were deemed unnecessary. The deal hammered out with RBS, HBOS, Lloyds and Barclays on Sunday night - at audiences with City minister Paul Myners that were described by one banker as \"not so much a meeting as a drive-by shooting\" - provided officials with enough confidence to believe that markets would be reassured.</p> <p>Stock markets soared on Monday and strains in the world's money markets also started to ease. It proved a temporary reprieve; by the middle of the week shares were on the slide and again and by Thursday night the FTSE 100 was lower than it had been the previous Friday.</p> <p>That was not the end of a rollercoaster week: a late rally on Wall Street allowed the FTSE to claw back above 4,000 points and close modestly up on the week. Amid fears that next year could see the economy contract for the first time since 1991 and unemployment surge above 2 million, there was concern about insurance companies, hedge funds and pension funds. But the banks are thought safe - for now.</p>",
  "<p>With a recession looming, and unemployment rising rapidly, it is not a good time to be job hunting - especially if you are the former boss of a bank that needs a government bail-out.</p> <p>There are now four such executives on the market: Lord Stevenson and Andy Hornby, the chairman and chief executive respectively of HBOS, and Sir Tom McKillop and Sir Fred Goodwin, their counterparts at RBS.</p> <p>But the prospects are not good. The likelihood of them landing another high-powered job in one of the UK's biggest organisations is slim, shareholders said yesterday. The fact is that the bosses who make the biggest mistakes have the least chance of a comeback - and if they ever do, the stigma is likely to follow them.</p> <p>One leading City shareholder described the chances of any of the four securing another top UK job is \"almost nil\".</p> <p>He added: \"Hornby might get a non-executive role eventually, mainly because of his youth and his experience in other sectors, but not the others. They have cost investors too much.\" He suggested they lie low, \"do some charity work\" and \"not try to blame others for what went wrong\".</p> <p>A City headhunter, who places executives in part-time, non-executive director positions, said he would not be willing to suggest any of the four to a big company \"for a very long time\". The alternative for fired executives in recent years, he said, was to move into the world of private equity, but the credit crunch has meant business there has dried up and highly paid consultancy roles have disappeared.</p> <p>The four don't even have the usual cushion of a whopping pay-off to help them over the coming months; they waived all payments before they were forced to.</p> <p>Previous bank bosses shown the door have never made it back into the big league of corporate life. </p> <p>Sir Derek Wanless was a big name in British banking. When he got the top job at NatWest he was one of the first forty-something bank chiefs, but he was bundled out after a failed takeover bid.</p> <p>Wanless was never going to get another such role, but he worked his way back by heading the government's review into the NHS. He also made the most of his Geordie roots, getting the chairman's job at Northumbrian Water and another directorship which has done nothing to help his rehabilitation: Northern Rock, where he monitored - or failed to monitor - the lender's risk.</p> <p>Ian Harley, who was ousted from Abbey National when shareholders tired of waiting for better results, has since picked up just a couple of boardroom seats - at British Energy and the employment agency Remploy. His commercial talents are also put to work on two charities and a pension fund.</p> <h2> The CVs </h2> <p><strong>Sir Fred Goodwin, 49 </strong></p> <p><strong>Previous job</strong> RBS chief, \u00a35.4m</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Glasgow law degree; accountancy</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Liquidator of BCCI.

  "<p><strong>The Sultan's Battery, which appears on the way towards Salt Market Village, is one of the prime tourist attractions of Kittur.</strong></p> <p>He walked fast towards the white dome of the Dargah, a fold-up wooden stool under one arm, and in the other a red bag with his album of photographs and seven bottles full of white pills. When he got to the Dargah, he walked along the wall, without paying any attention to the long line of beggars along the wall: the lepers who were sitting on rags, the men with mutilated arms and legs, the men in wheelchairs and the men with bandages covering their eyes, and the one creature, with little brown stubs like a seal's flippers where he should have had arms, a normal left leg, and a soft brown stump where he should have had a second leg, who lay on his left side, twitching his hip continuously, like an animal getting galvanic shocks, and intoning, with blank, mesmerised eyes: \"Al-lah! Al-laaaah! Al-lah! Al-laaah!\" </p> <p>He walked past this sorrowful parade of humanity, and went behind the Dargah. </p> <p>Now he went between the vendors squatting on the ground in a long line that extended for half a mile. He passed rows of baby shoes, bras, T-shirts bearing the logo \"New York Fucking City\", fake Ray-Ban sunglasses, fake Nike shoes and fake Adidas shoes, and piles of Urdu and Malayalam magazines. He spotted an opening in between a counterfeit shoe-seller and a counterfeit bra-vendor, and unfolded his stool there, and put a glossy black sheet of paper with gold lettering on the stool. </p> <p>The golden words read: </p> <p>RATNAKARA SHETTY, SPECIAL INVITEE, FOURTH PAN-ASIAN CONFERENCE ON SEXOLOGY, HOTEL NEW HILLTOP PALACE, NEW DELHI </p> <p>APRIL 12-14 1987</p> <p>The young men who had come to pray at the Dargah, or to eat lamb kebabs in one of the Muslim restaurants, or simply to watch the sea, began making a semicircle around Ratna, watching, as he put down on the stool a mauve photo album, and the seven bottles of white pills. With grave ceremony, he then rearranged the bottles, as if their position had to be exactly right for his work to begin. In truth, he was waiting for more onlookers. </p> <p>They came. Standing in pairs or alone, the crowd of young men had now taken on the look of a human Stonehenge; some with their hands folded on a friend's shoulder; some standing alone; and a few crouched by the ground, like fallen boulders. </p> <p>All at once, Ratna began to talk. Young men came quicker, and the crowd became so thick that it was two-or three-persons deep at each point; and those at the back had to stand on their toes to get a partial glimpse of the sexologist. </p> <p>He opened the album, and let the young men see the photos in plastic folders inside. The onlookers gasped. </p> <p>Pointing to his photographs, Ratna spoke of abominations and perversions. He described the consequences of sin: he demonstrated the passage of venereal germs up the body, touching his nipples, his eyes, and then his nostrils, and then closing his eyes. The sun climbed the sky, and the white dome of the Dargah shone more brightly. The young men in the semicircle pressed against each other, straining to get closer to the photographs. Then Ratna went in for the kill: he closed the book, and held up a bottle of white pills in both of his hands. He began shaking the pills. </p> <p>\"With each bottle of pills you will receive a certificate of authenticity from Hakim Bhagwandas of Daryaganj in Delhi. This man, an experienced old doctor, has brought wisdom from Egypt, and has used his scientific equipment to create magnificent white pills that will heal all your ailments. Each bottle costs just four rupees and fifty paise! Yes, that is all you pay to atone for sin and earn a second chance in this life! Four rupees and fifty paise!\" </p> <p>In the evening, dead-tired from the heat, he got on to the 34B bus with his red bag and fold-up stool. It was packed full at this hour: so he held on to a strap hanging from the ceiling of the bus and breathed in and out slowly. He counted to 10, to get his strength back, then put a hand into the red bag, and took out four green brochures, each of which had an image of three large rats on the cover. He held the brochures up high in one hand, in the manner of a gambler holding up his cards, and spoke at the top of his voice: </p> <p>\"Ladies and gentlemen! All of you know that we live in a rat race, where there are few jobs, and many job applicants. How will your children survive, how will they get the jobs you have? For life in this day and age is a veritable rat race. Only in this booklet will you find thousands of useful general knowledge data, arranged in question and answer form, that your sons and daughters need to pass the civil service entrance examination, the bank entrance examination, the police entrance examination, and many other exams which are needed to win the rat race. For instance\" - he took a quick breath - \"The Mughal empire had two capitals; Delhi was one of them. Which was the other? Four capital cities of Europe are built on the banks of one river. Name that river. Who was the first king of Germany? What is the currency of Angola? One city in Europe has been the capital of three different empires. Which city? Two men were involved in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Nathuram Godse was one of them. Name the other man. What is the height of the Eiffel Tower in metres?\" Holding the pamphlets up with his right hand, he staggered forward, bracing himself as the bus bumped over the potholes of the road. One passenger asked for a pamphlet, and handed him a rupee. Ratna walked back, and waited near the exit door; when the bus slowed down, he dipped his head in silent thanks to the conductor, and got off. </p> <p>He walked into his house , hung his shirt on a hook next to the door, kicked the door open, and walked in scratching his armpits and hairy chest. He sat down on a chair, exhaled, said \"O Krishna, O Krishna,\" and stretched his legs out; even though they were in the kitchen, his daughters knew at once that he had come in - a powerful odour of stale feet went through the house like a warning cannon shot. They dropped their women's magazines, and rushed at once to their work. The wife was making noise with some plates and pots. </p> <p>After he had smoked his second beedi, and his body had visibly relaxed, she built up the courage to come near: \"The astrologer said he would come at nine.\" </p> <p>\"Uhm.\"</p> <p>The radio was turned on; he put it on his thigh, and slapped his palm on his other thigh to the beat of the music, humming constantly, and singing the words whenever he knew them. </p> <p>\"He's here,\" she whispered. He turned the radio off, as the astrologer came into the room and folded his palms in a namaste. </p> <p>Sitting down on his chair, he took off his shirt, which Ratna's wife hung for him on the hook next to Ratna's own shirt. While Ratna's wife and the girls waited in the kitchen, the astrologer showed Ratna the choice of boys. </p> <p>He opened an album, in which he had black and white photos; he gazed at the faces of boy after boy, who looked back at him in tense, unsmiling portraits. Ratna scraped one with his thumb. The astrologer slid it out of the album. </p> <p>\"Boy looks OK,\" Ratna said, after a moment's concentration. \"The father does what for a living?\" </p> <p>\"Owns a firecracker shop in Car Street. A very good business. Boy inherits it.\" </p> <p>\"His own business,\" Ratna exclaimed, with genuine satisfaction. \"It's the only way ahead in the rat race: being a salesman is a dead end.\" </p> <p>His wife dropped something in the kitchen; then coughed; then dropped something else.</p> <p>\"What's going on?\" he shouted.</p> <p>A timid voice said something about \"horoscopes\". </p> <p>\"Shut up!\" Ratna shouted. He jerked the photo at the kitchen - \"I have three daughters to marry off and this damn bitch thinks I can be choose?\" - and he threw the photo back into the astrologer's lap.</p> <p>The astrologer drew an X across the back of the photo. </p> <p>\"The boy's parents will expect something,\" he said. \"A gesture.\" </p> <p>\"Dowry,\" Ratna gave the evil its proper name in a soft voice. \"Fine. I've saved money up for this girl.\" He breathed out. \"Where I'll get dowry for the next two, though, God alone knows.\" </p> <p>Gritting his teeth in anger, he turned to the kitchen and shouted. </p> <p>The next Monday, the boy's party turned up. The younger girls were made to go around with a tray full of lemon juice, while Ratna and his wife sat in the drawing room. Rukmini's face was whitened by a thick layer of Johnson's baby powder, and streams of jasmine ran through her hair; she plucked the strings of a veena and recited a religious song, while looking out the window at something far away. </p> <p>The prospective groom's father, the firecracker merchant, was sitting on a mattress directly opposite Rukmini; he was a huge man in a white shirt and a white cotton sarong, with thick tufts of glossy, silvery hair sticking out of his ears. He moved his head to the rhythm of the song Rukmini was playing, which Ratna took as an encouraging sign. The prospective mother-in-law, another enormous fair-skinned creature, looked around at the ceiling and the corners of the house. The groom-to-be had his father's fair skin and features, but he was much smaller than either his father or his mother, and seemed more the family's domestic pet than the scion. Halfway through the song, he leaned over and whispered something into his father's hairy ears. </p> <p>The merchant nodded. The boy got up and left. The father held up a small finger and showed it to everyone in the room. </p> <p>Everyone giggled. </p> <p>The boy came back, and squirmed into place between his fat father and fat mother. The two younger girls came with a second tray of lemon juice, and the fat firecracker merchant and his wife took glasses; as if only to follow them, the boy also took a glass and sipped. Almost as soon as the fluid touched his lips, he tapped his father and whispered into his hairy ear again. This time the old man grimaced; but the boy ran out. </p> <p>Perhaps to distract attention from his son, the firecracker merchant asked, in a raspy voice: \"Do you have a beedi, my good man?\" </p> <p>Searching in the kitchen for his packet of beedis, Ratna saw, through the grille in the window, the bridegroom-to-be urinating furiously into the trunk of an Ashoka tree that grew in the backyard. </p> <p>Nervous fellow, he thought, grinning. But that's only natural, he thought, feeling a little affection already for this fellow who was going to be part of his family soon. All men are nervous before their weddings. The boy appeared to have done with his piddle; he shook his penis, and stepped back from the tree. But instead of walking away, he stood frozen. After a moment he craned his head back and gasped for air, like a man drowning. </p> <p>The matchmaker returned in the evening to report that the firecracker merchant seemed satisfied with Rukmini's singing. </p> <p>\"Get the date fixed up soon,\" he told Ratna. \"In a month, the rental rates for the wedding halls will start to -\" he made an upward gliding motion with his palms. </p> <p>Ratna nodded, but seemed distracted. </p> <p>The next morning, he took the bus to Umbrella Street, walking past the furniture and fan shops until he found the firecracker shop. The fat man with the hairy ears sat on a high stool, in front of a wall full of paper bombs and rockets, like an emissary of the God of Fire and War. The groom-to-be was also in the shop, down on the floor, licking his fingertips and turning the pages of a ledger. </p> <p>The fat man gave his son a light kick. </p> <p>\"This man is going to be your father-in-law, aren't you going to say hi?\" He smiled at Ratna: \"The boy is a shy one.\" Ratna sipped tea, chatted with the fat man, and kept an eye on the boy all the time. </p> <p>\"Come with me, son,\" he said, \"I have something to ask you in private.\" </p> <p>The two walked down the road, neither saying a word, till they got to a banyan tree growing near the side of a Hanuman temple. Ratna indicated that they should sit down in the shade of the tree. He wanted the boy to turn his back to the traffic, so they were staring at the temple. For a while Ratna let the young man talk, doing nothing except observe his eyes, ears, nose, mouth and neck. All at once, he seized the fellow's wrist. </p> <p>\"Where did you find this prostitute that you sat with?\" </p> <p>The boy wanted to get up, but Ratna increased the pressure on his wrist to indicate there would be no escape. The boy turned his face to the road, as if pleading for help. Ratna increased the pressure on the boy's wrist. </p> <p>\"Where did you sit with her? By the side of a road, inside a hotel, or at the back of a building?\" </p> <p>He twisted harder. </p> <p>\"By the side of a road,\" the boy blurted out; then turned to Ratna with a face about to burst into tears. \"How do you know?\" </p> <p>Ratna closed his eyes; breathed out; let go of the boy's wrist. \"A truckers' whore.\" He slapped the boy on the head. The boy began crying. \"I only sat with her once,\" he said, fighting back his sobs. </p> <p>\"Once is enough. Do you burn when you pass urine?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, I burn.\" </p> <p>\"Nausea?\" </p> <p>The boy asked what that English word meant, and said \"yes\" when he understood. </p> <p>\"What else?\" </p> <p>\"A feeling that there is something large and hard - like a solid rubber ball between my legs all the time. And then dizziness, sometimes sickness.\" </p> <p>\"Can you get erect?\" </p> <p>\"Yes. No.\" </p> <p>\"Tell me what your organ looks like. Is it black? Is it red? Are the lips of your penis swollen?\" </p> <p>Half an hour later, the two men were still at the base of the banyan tree, facing the temple. </p> <p>\"I beg you ...\" The boy folded his palms. \"I beg you.\" Ratna shook his head. </p> <p>\"I have to cancel the wedding, what else can I do now? How can I let my daughter get this disease too?\" </p> <p>The boy stared hard at the earth, as if he had simply run out of ways to beg. A drop of moisture on the tip of his nose gleamed like silver. </p> <p>\"I'll ruin you,\" he said quietly. Ratna wiped his hands on the back of his sarong. \"How?\" </p> <p>\"I'll say that the girl has slept with someone. I'll say that she's not a virgin. That's why you had to cancel the wedding.\" </p> <p>In one swift motion, Ratna seized the boy's head, yanked it back, held it for a moment like that, and then slammed it against the tree. He got up and spat on the boy. </p> <p>\"I swear by the god who sits in the temple before us, I will kill you with my own hands if you do that.\"</p> <p>Three months or so passed. One morning, he was back at his spot behind the white dome, shouting at the Stonehenge of worried young men, when he saw a face that made his heart stop. </p> <p>Afterwards, when he was done with his talk, he saw the face again, in front of him. </p> <p>\"What do you want?\" he hissed. \"It's too late. My daughter's married now. Why have you come here now?\" </p> <p>Ratna folded his stool under his arm, dropped his medicines into his red bag, and walked fast. A flurry of footsteps followed him. The boy - the firecracker merchant's son - panted as he spoke. </p> <p>\"Things are becoming worse by the day. I can't pass urine without my penis burning hard. You must do something for me. You must give me your pills.\" </p> <p>Ratna gnashed his teeth. \"You sinned, you bastard. You sat with a prostitute. Now pay for it!\" </p> <p>He walked faster, and faster, and then the footsteps were gone and he was alone. </p> <p>But the next evening, he saw the face again: then the quick steps followed him all the way to the bus stand, and the voice said, again and again, \"help me\", but Ratna did not turn round. </p> <p>He got on to the bus. When the dark outline of the fort appeared in the distance, the bus slowed down and stopped. He got off. Someone else got off with him. He walked. Someone else walked behind him. </p> <p>Ratna spun around and seized his stalker by his collar. \"Didn't I tell you, leave me alone? What has got into you?\" The boy pushed Ratna's hands away, and straightened his collar, and whispered: \"Help me. I think I'm dying. Help me.\" </p> <p>\"Look here, I can't. None of those young men is going to be cured by anything I sell. Don't you get it?\" There was a moment of silence, and then the boy whispered: \"But you were at the sexology conference ... the sign in English says so ...\" </p> <p>Ratna raised his hands to the sky. </p> <p>\"I found that sign on the ground.\" </p> <p>\"But the Hakim Bhagwandas of Delhi ...\" </p> <p>\"Hakim Bhagwandas, my arse! Those are white sugar pills that I buy wholesale from a chemist in Karwar; then my daughter bottles them and sticks labels on them at my house!\" </p> <p>To prove his point, he opened his leather case, popped a bottle open, and scattered the pills across the ground, as if broadcasting seed on the earth. \"They do nothing! I have nothing for you, son!\" </p> <p>The boy sat down, picked up a white pill from the earth, and swallowed it. He got down on all fours, and scrambled about the black mud for the white pills, which he began swallowing in a frenzy along with any dirt attached to them. \"Are you mad?\" </p> <p>Getting down on his knees, Ratna gave the boy a good shake, and asked the same question again and again. </p> <p>And then, at last, he saw the boy's eyes. They had changed since he had last seen them; teary and red, they were like pickled vegetables of some kind. Individual blood vessels bulged and swelled large. </p> <p>For several hours that night Ratna stayed awake, wriggling in his bed, and disturbing his wife. He had soliloquies with the boy, who seemed to be somewhere around his bed. </p> <p>The next day, in the evening, he took the bus into the city, back into Umbrella Street. When he got to the firecracker shop he stood at a distance, with his arms folded, until the boy saw him. The two of them walked together in silence for a while, until they came to a sugarcane juice stand. As the machines turned and crushed the raw cane, Ratna said: </p> <p>\"Go to the hospital. They'll help you.\" </p> <p>\"I can't go to the hospital. They know me. They'll tell my father.\" </p> <p>Ratna had a vision of that immense man with the tufts of white hair growing out of his ears, sitting in front of his arsenal of firecrackers and paper bombs. </p> <p>The next day, as Ratna was folding up his wooden stand and suitcase, he saw a shadow on the ground in front of him. He went around the Dargah; he walked past the long line of pilgrims going in to pray at the tomb, and past the rows of lepers, and past the man with one leg who was lying on the ground, twitching from the hip and chanting: \"Al-lah! Al-laaaah! Al-lah! Al-laaah!\" </p> <p>He looked up at the white dome and stared for a moment. He went down to the sea, and the shadow followed him. A low stone wall ran around the edge of the land, and he put his right foot on it, and looked out at the sea. The waves were coming in violently; now and then there was a big crash of water against the wall, and thick white foam rose up into the air and spread out, like a peacock's tail coming up from the sea. Ratna turned around. </p> <p>\"What choice do I have? If I don't sell those white pills, how will I marry my daughters off?\" </p> <p>The boy, avoiding his glances, stared at the ground, and shifted his weight about uncomfortably. </p> <p>The two of them caught the no 5 bus and took it all the way to the heart of the city, getting off near the Angel Talkies. The boy carried the wooden stool, and Ratna searched up and down the main road, until he found a large billboard of a husband and a wife standing together in wedding clothes: </p> <p>HAPPY LIFE CLINIC </p> <p>Consulting Specialist: </p> <p>Doctor MV Kamath MBBS (Mysore), B Mec (Allahabad), DBBS (Mysore), MCh (Calcutta), G Com (Varanasi). SATISFACTION GUARANTEED </p> <p>\"You see those letters after his name?\" Ratna whispered into the boy's ear. \"That's the man for you. He's a real sexologist.\" </p> <p>In the waiting room, they saw a half dozen lean, nervous men sitting on black chairs, and one married couple, in a corner. Ratna and the boy sat down in between the single men and the couple. Ratna looked curiously at the men; all of them avoided his glance. These were the same fellows who came to him - older, sadder versions; men in whom venereal disease had taken a deep bite, who had thrown bottle after bottle of white pills at it, to find no improvement - who were now at the end of a long journey of despair, that led from his booth at the Dargah, through a long trail of other hucksters, to this doctor's clinic, where they would be told the truth at last. </p> <p>One by one, the lean men went into the doctor's room, and the door shut behind them. Ratna looked at the married couple, and thought - at least they are not alone in this ordeal. At least they have each other. </p> <p>Then the man got up to see the doctor; the woman stayed back. She went in later, after the man had left. Of course they are not husband and wife, Ratna told himself. When he gets this disease, this disease of sex, every man is alone in the universe. </p> <p>\"And who are you in relation to the patient?\" the doctor asked. They had taken their seats, at last, at his consulting desk. There was a giant chart showing a cross-section of a man's urinary and reproductive organs on the wall behind the doctor, and Ratna looked at it for a moment, and then said: \"His uncle.\" </p> <p>After examining the boy's genitals, the doctor moved to a washbasin with a mirror attached over it; he pulled a cord, and a tube-light flickered to life over the mirror. </p> <p>Letting the water run in the basin, he gargled and spat, and then turned the light over the basin off. He took care of janitorial duties around his office - wiping a corner of the basin with a palm, then lowering a blind over a window, casting a glance into the state of his green plastic waste-basket. When he ran out of things to do, he returned to his desk, looked at his feet, and practised breathing for a while. </p> <p>\"His kidneys are gone.\" </p> <p>\"Gone?\" </p> <p>\"Gone,\" the doctor said. </p> <p>He turned to the boy, who was trembling so hard that his seat had begun to totter. </p> <p>\"Are you a homosexual?\" </p> <p>The boy covered his face in his hands. Ratna answered for him. </p> <p>\"Look, he got it from a prostitute, there's no sin in that. He's not an unnatural fellow. He just didn't know enough about this world we live in.\" </p> <p>The doctor nodded. He turned around, to the image of the male reproductive system behind him, and put his finger on the kidneys, and said: \"Gone.\" </p> <p>Ratna and the boy came together to the bus station the next day, at six in the morning, to catch the bus to Manipal, to see if there was a good doctor at the Medical College who might help them out. A man in a blue sarong, sitting on the bench in the station, told them that the bus to Manipal was always delayed by a few minutes, maybe 15, maybe 30, maybe more. \"Everything's been falling apart in this country since Mrs Gandhi got shot,\" the man said, and kicked his legs about merrily. \"Buses are coming late. Trains are coming late. Everything's falling apart. We'll have to hand this country back to the British or the Muslims or the Russians or someone, I tell you. We're not meant to be masters of our own fate, I tell you.\" </p> <p>It was late on the way back as well. The two of them had to stand in the midst of the thick crowd returning to Kittur for over an hour, until a pair of seats emptied near them. Ratna slid into the window seat and motioned for the boy to sit down next to him. \"We got lucky, considering how packed the bus is,\" Ratna said with a smile. </p> <p>Gently, he disengaged his hand from the boy's. The boy understood too; he nodded, and took out his wallet, and threw five-rupee notes, one after the other, on Ratna's lap. </p> <p>\"What's this for?\" </p> <p>\"You said you wanted something for helping me.\" </p> <p>Ratna thrust the notes into the boy's shirt pocket. \"Don't go and get an attitude now. I have helped you out so far; and what did I have to gain from it? It was pure public service on my part, remember that. We aren't related: there's no blood in common between us.\" </p> <p>The boy said nothing. </p> <p>\"Look! I can't keep coming around with you as you go from doctor to doctor. I've got my daughters to marry off, I don't know where I'll get the dowry for -\" </p> <p>The boy turned, plunged his face into Ratna's collar-bone and burst into sobs; his lips rubbed against Ratna's clavicles, and began sucking on them. The passengers stared at them, and Ratna was too bewildered to say anything. </p> <p>It took another hour before the outline of the black fort appeared on the horizon. The man and the boy got off the bus together. Against the black rectangle of the fort, Ratna had a vision, momentarily, of a white dome, and he heard a throng of mutilated beings chanting in unison. He put a beedi in his mouth, struck a match and inhaled. </p> <p>\"Let's go,\" he told the boy. \"It's a long walk from here to my house.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger is published by Atlantic (\u00a312.99).

You don't need A-level German to grasp that message - Golf is the bestselling, all-conquering life-blood of VW, if not its soul.</p> <p>The importance of the car to VW explains why it has chosen to unveil Golf's sixth incarnation in Iceland, no expense spared. It has built a handsome timber-and-glass pavilion in the mountains, where handsome Germans dressed in black efficiently commandeer a fleet of Golfs. But Iceland is a mistake. Its breathtaking black mountains, erupting geysers and shops selling cosy, hand-knitted mittens are just too distracting. VW would have been better launching the Golf on a particularly ugly stretch of the M25 - without cute Icelandic churches to divert the attention, you'd have nothing better to do than contemplate the dashboard or fiddle with the stereo. Furthermore, VW says this is the quietest Golf yet, thanks to improved door seals and thicker window glass: on eerily empty mountain passes, you never really put this to the test. </p> <p>The Mark VI arrives indecently hot on the heels of the Mk V, which was launched in 2004 and had the shortest model life of any Golf to date (the original lasted from 1974 to 1984). Quite simply, Mk V wasn't shifting enough cars, we are told over lobster thermidor, so its successor has been rushed out, production time slashed and costs lowered.</p> <p>Accordingly, there is no drastic redesign, just a gentle evolution overseen by design chief Walter de Silva to make it \"more unmistakably Golf\"-like. Translation: the front grille is designed to resemble the 1974 original - remember those? - with the Mk V's boxier version elongated horizontally. A small face-lift now that, at 35, the Golf is getting a few wrinkles around the eyes.</p> <p>It's the inside that's had the most work done. The finishes are more luxurious, the seats plumper and the white, deeply-set dials are stylishly backlit and trimmed in aluminium. All very Marc Newson. The steering wheel has new buttons to control the sound system and trip computer, but the result is too cluttered: I'm having enough trouble avoiding oncoming Nordic 4x4s with snow tyres without figuring out which of the many paddles turns down Bj\u00f6rk. And the wheel itself is contoured to such a degree that it acts like a driving instructor: my co-pilot is forced into the 10-to-two position by dint of it being the comfiest, when really he's a one-handed, six-30 kind of guy.</p> <p>The new 2.0-litre TDI diesel engine we drive has an impressive, six-speed automatic DSG gearbox and a nannyish optional cruise control that keeps you a safe distance from the car in front. More importantly, this model is one of the most efficient around. It will also be available later in 2009 as a BlueMotion 1.6-litre model, VW's laudable sustainability concept first introduced with the Polo in 2006. This hopes to achieve a positively planet-saving 74.3mpg, emitting 99g CO2/km. </p> <p>But, best of all, the new Golf rips along merrily: slam the gear stick into \"sport\" mode and it powers you with surprising ease up even the steepest Icelandic volcano - should you ever find yourself at the foot of one.</p>",
  "<p>Introducing your baby to food is an adventure. It's also the moment at which all your most powerful anxieties may rear their heads: do whatever you have to - shadow boxing, Vedanta meditation, even parachute drops if that's what it takes - to find a way to relax and just enjoy it.</p> <p>A very quick run through the basic rules. The point at which the World Health Organisation recommends introducing solid foods is six months. Start by pureeing, and then graduate (as quickly as possible because the sooner babies get used to texture the better) to forking up and fingerfoods. The sooner you can let them make a mess and feed themselves the better. Some foods should be completely avoided for the first year: honey, egg whites (some health officials suggest avoiding the yolks too)and nuts. Not too much salt or chilli. Fruit juices too may cause stomach problems. Some avoid tomatoes, others don't. And that's it - you're off. It's really no more complicated than that. </p> <p>These rules don't exclude giving your baby little tastes of whatever you're eating from as young as four months. The thing to remember over and over again is that you are introducing them to your food. Not to jars of baby food (these certainly have their uses, but should only be used occasionally for convenience, not as the main source of food, otherwise you risk a child with a narrow and fussy palate); not to fromage frais, not to mashed banana forever, but to the foods that you like. Vegetables, mild curries, stews, omelettes, baked potatoes, all these and more make lovely food for baby too. This is where your freezer comes in handy: make up batches and freeze them in ice-cube trays. </p> <p>Here are a couple of very simple recipes which make lovely dinners for babies ...</p> <h2>Lorraine Kelly's cheesy lentil savoury</h2> <p><strong>You need</strong><br>2 tbsp red lentils<br>250ml water<br>1 carrot, peeled and sliced <br>1 small onion (finely chopped)<br>2 tbsp cheddar cheese (grated) </p> <p>Put the lentils, water and vegetables in a saucepan.

  "<p>In the first half of the 19th century, the British began to discover Normandy. Previously, the point of entry into France for most travellers had been Calais, which felt safely half-English, and where even the beggars importuned new arrivals in their own language. Those prepared to make the longer crossing to Dieppe were rewarded with a greater sense of strangeness: typified by the women in red-and-blue regional costume, clacking sabots and high white coifs that made them look like a cross between chefs and nuns. Hazlitt, passing through in 1824, noted that such headdresses were \"much the same as those which the Spectator laughed out of countenance a hundred years ago in England\"; and he concluded more generally that \"In France one lives in the imagination of the past\". For the tourist, this meant antiquities and picturesque ruins within easy reach. The coastline was a further attraction: for those addicted to the new health-kick of sea-bathing, to the gentler pleasures of gambling (the casino at Dieppe opened in 1822), or to painting and sketching. Gradually, the journey from London became quicker - a combination of the London to Brighton railway and the new steam-packets brought the time down to a mere 11 hours by the 1840s. For centuries Dieppe's main relationship with Britain had consisted of suffering occasional bombardment from the Royal Navy; now there were not just summer tourists, but year-round residents. There was even a quartier des Anglais (on the hill between the Paris road and the chateau), served by an Anglican chaplain and a British consul. And since the French more or less simultaneously decided to make Dieppe a sophisticated destination, the town flourished.</p> <p>British artists had started coming here as soon as the Napoleonic wars were over. John Sell Cotman delighted in the luminous quality of the Dieppe light (it is an unpatriotic truth that looking north from Dieppe is more visually complex than looking south from Brighton); Turner came several times in the 1820s; Richard Parkes Bonington in the 1830s. We tend to associate the Normandy coastline - Etretat, Pourville, Varengeville, F\u00e9camp - with Monet and the impressionists; but (as with C\u00e9zanne and Mont Sainte-Victoire) previous generations of painters had preceded them. Boudin, who later taught Monet the principles, and the necessity, of pleinairisme, painted in Dieppe, as did Corot and Daubigny; while Delacroix came here in 1850 and 1852. His diary contains an unflattering depiction of the English colony, whose invitation he had accepted out of boredom. He went to the salon of a certain Mrs Sheppard, and the next day rebuked himself: \"What a fool you are, getting a sore throat from talking to idiots, arguing with petticoated silliness for a whole evening, with everyone going on about God, and 'the justice of the world' and 'good and evil', and 'progress'!\"</p> <p>Now that the Channel tunnel has restored most traffic to the more northerly crossing, and the ferry service from Newhaven runs at unfriendly hours, Dieppe has sunk back into being largely French again. Serious war damage makes it harder to recreate in the mind the century - from 1815 to 1914 - during which the town became so fashionable. By the 1850s it had \"the smartest and most popular plage in France\"; the casino was rebuilt at regular intervals, each time more extravagantly; the British laid out what was only the fourth golf course in France, while the Paris crowd came down for steeplechasing at the new racetrack. The Prince of Wales kept a mistress and perhaps an illegitimate child in Dieppe; Lord Salisbury, while prime minister, built himself a chalet outside the town and maintained that, thanks to the telegraph station at Beachy Head, he was in better contact with London than if he had been on a Scottish grouse moor.</p> <p>Simona Pakenham, who chronicled Dieppe's Anglo-French entente in 60 Miles from England (1967), commented tartly that \"The English colony was generally indifferent to any form of culture\". But the French needed the arts as the British needed sports. So Liszt played at the Bains Chauds; Meyebeer came; Rossini composed an operetta for the theatre. By the end of the 19th century, the casino summer band was recognised as the best in the country, since it was filled by Parisian orchestral players on holiday. In 1907, one of its violists was promoted to conductor, and surprised everyone by directing all Beethoven's symphonies from memory: this was Pierre Monteux, who six years later conducted the premiere of The Rite of Spring. </p> <p>Not all the British visitors were philistines. The town was Sickert's second home for several decades; and the British feature strongly in the impressive (and highly cosmopolitan) list of belle \u00e9poque visitors to the town. These include Monet, Pissarro, Whistler, Degas, Renoir, Beardsley, Conder, Fritz Thurlaw (the Norwegian painter), Henry Harland (the editor of The Yellow Book), William Rothenstein, Proust, Saint-Saens, Faur\u00e9, Debussy, Maeterlinck, Puvis de Chavannes, Percy Grainger, Adelina Patti, George and Gerald du Maurier, Ernest Dowson, George Moore, Max Beerbohm, Annie Besant, Marie Tempest, John Barrymore and Gladys Cooper. The night boat of May 20 1897 brought Oscar Wilde, freshly sprung from Reading jail and carrying the manuscript of De Profundis. It is a small but interesting footnote to the history of the Dieppe ferry terminal that the two most noteworthy events there both involved pseudonyms. In 1848 Louis-Philippe, the last king of France, heading for exile in England, was hustled aboard a packet of the General Steam and Navigational Company bearing a passport in the suspiciously ordinary name of William Smith. Half a century later, Wilde came ashore, cloaked in the look-at-me alias of Sebastian Melmoth.</p> <p>The British brought trade, money and work to Dieppe; they laid the railway, and built the town's station with English bricks. Neither race was or is as hospitable as they like to imagine themselves, but a working cordiality existed between the French and the British. The portrait painter and socialite Jacques-Emile Blanche (1861-1942) operated for many years as a one-man diplomatic service, summering in Dieppe and wintering in London: his studio, just beneath the walls of the castle, was used by Degas, Whistler, Sargent, Boldini, Sickert, Conder, Beardsley and Helleu. \"My dear friend,\" Henry James said to Blanche, \"Your Dieppe is a reduced Florence, every type of character for a novelist seems to gather there\" - not that the Great Dieppe Novel was ever written. Such Anglo-French conviviality was helped by a willingness to speak one another's language. Sickert was regarded as \"un vrai Dieppois\", even managing the local fisherfolk's patois; Wilde and Dowson both spoke and wrote excellent French. So did an English poet whose passing residence along the coast in 1868 led to one of the stranger Anglo-French literary encounters, one that echoed on for decades, in France at least. It also encapsulated the way the French preferred to see the British - and perhaps still do.</p> <p>Etretat, some 50 miles west of Dieppe, has become a high point of pilgrimage for the artistic faithful, who gather above its white cliffs - especially the one that curves down into a great chalk flying-buttress - to compare eroded reality with visual memories of Monet's pictures. By 1868 the impressionists had not yet arrived: Etretat was a fishing town that also attracted a certain number of tourists and summer residents. Among their number that year were the 18-year-old Guy de Maupassant and his mother (the family chateau of Miromesnil, where Guy had been born, was a few miles outside Dieppe). The water and its attendant pursuits - swimming, boating, rowing - were to become a thematic constant in Maupassant's life and work; so it's appropriate that the water was what provoked the encounter between this muscular, boastfully heterosexual French prose writer and a petite homosexual English poet: Algernon Charles Swinburne.</p> <p>Swinburne, then aged 31, was staying outside the town in a low thatched cottage belonging to his friend George Powell. The people of Etretat had Frenchly decided that Powell was a milord - even if one modestly concealing his real identity under his mother's maiden name. (In fact, Powell was his real name, and he was uncoroneted. He was brought up on the family estate at Nanteos, near Aberystwyth, went to Eton and Oxford, and died at 40.) Maupassant later wrote that Powell's \"solitary and bizarre\" way of life had astonished the local bourgeois and mariners who were \"little used to British fantasies and eccentricities\"; he himself was to be afforded a closer look at what such Britishness consisted of. </p> <p>One September morning, Swinburne went swimming from the beach at Etretat and got into difficulties. According to Powell, treacherous undercurrents had carried the poet out to sea \"through a rocky archway\" (that very cliff formation Monet later celebrated). Ten minutes later Powell heard shouts from the clifftop that a man was drowning. He ran to the water's edge, and after a few minutes received the news that Swinburne had been safely picked up by a fishing smack heading for nearby Yport. The poet, writing to his mother (and doubtless downplaying the event), described \"a real sea adventure\" in which he had been swept two miles out: \"Luckily I was all right but very tired, and the result was that I made immense friends with all the fishermen and sailors about - who are quite the nicest people I ever knew.\" Maupassant, who was somewhere near the scene, claimed that the poet had been \"dead drunk\" (despite it being ten o'clock in the morning); also, that he himself had gone out in one of the rescue boats; alternatively, that he had at the very least waded into the water and got soaked to the waist. </p> <p>Whatever the specifics of the near-drowning and the rescue, Maupassant received an invitation to lunch the next day from the grateful Powell. According to Swinburne (again writing to his mother), the place where they lived was an idyllic retreat: \"Powell has got the sweetest little farmhouse fitted up with music, books, drawings, etc ... and of course he pokes me into the nicest room ... There is a wild little garden all uphill, and avenues of trees about. The sea is splendid, and the cliffs very like the Isle of Wight - two arches of rock each side of the bay, and one needle only, exactly like half the Freshwater pair.\" Maupassant described his visit to the cottage on three separate occasions: orally to Flaubert, Alphonse Daudet and Edmond de Goncourt in February 1875, an account that Goncourt transcribed into his Journal; in a newspaper article of November 1882 for Le Gaulois (\"L'Anglais d'Etretat\"); and in his introduction to the French translation of Swinburne's Poems and Ballads in 1891. Though the versions overlap and at times contradict one another, the main story line would have been enough to send the honest burghers of the Isle of Wight scaring up the libel lawyers.</p> <p>Maupassant noted \"an inscription over the door which I didn't read on that first occasion\" - though if he had, he would have known more what to expect. There were pictures everywhere, some \"splendid\", others more like \"the imaginings of a lunatic\". Powell was short and fat, Swinburne short and thin, \"with a pointed face, a hydrocephalous forehead, pigeon-chested, agitated by a trembling which affected his glass with St Vitus' dance, and talking incessantly like a madman.\" Here and there were laid out displays of bones; while a flayed human hand, supposedly that of a parricide, was the bohemian equivalent of a talking point. A large pet monkey was noisily present, being \"titillated\" by Powell, and trying to shove Maupassant's head into his glass whenever he took a drink. Lunch included what the Frenchman assumed to be some kind of fish; though when he asked its name, his host \"replied with a peculiar smile that it was meat, and I could not get any more out of him.\" The fact that spirits rather than wine were served with lunch also struck the young Frenchman as peculiar - though perhaps was not all that surprising. Many of the British who were attracted to France at this time (not just artists and writers, but bankrupts, runaway fraudsters and bogus priests, mixed up with respectable folk seeking to make a pension stretch further than it did in England) were struck by the cheapness of French spirits - which also, of course, made them drunker quicker.</p> <p>After lunch the two Englishmen brought out some gigantic portfolios and showed young Guy - perhaps in a misguided attempt to groom him - pornographic photographs taken in Germany, all of male subjects. \"I remember one of an English soldier masturbating on a pane of glass.\" Powell was by this time very drunk, and kept sucking the fingers of the flayed hand (which was apparently used as a paperweight). A young servant came in, and the portfolio was swiftly closed. In these exotic and ghoulish surroundings, the conversation proceeded at the highest cultural level. Swinburne, who had published his first series of Poems and Ballads two years previously, and was already notorious in his own country, displayed \"an immense fund of learning\". He translated some of his poems into French for Maupassant's benefit, and enthused about Victor Hugo (whose entry in the Encyclopaedia Britannica he was subsequently to write). Powell for his part had been to Iceland and brought back a store of old songs and legends which he had translated. The two men struck Maupassant as \"singularly original, remarkable and bizarre\", a pair of hallucinatory visionaries in the tradition of Poe and ETA Hoffmann. \"If genius,\" he concluded, \"is, as people say, a kind of delirium of the higher intelligence, then Algernon Charles Swinburne is assuredly a genius.\"</p> <p>Maupassant accepted a second invitation to lunch a few days later. This passed more peacefully, since the intrusive monkey was now dead, hanged from a tree by the young servant. Powell had ordered a huge block of granite for its tomb. At the end of the meal the two visionaries gave the Frenchman some liquor which nearly knocked him out; taking fright, he fled back to his hotel. Even so, he made one last visit, in the course of which he drew attention to the inscription above their door. It read: Chaumi\u00e8re de Dolmanc\u00e9 (Dolmanc\u00e9's Cottage). Maupassant asked the Englishmen if they knew who Dolmanc\u00e9 was (the hero and homosexual corrupter of Sade's La Philosophie dans le Boudoir). They said that indeed they did. \"Then that is the sign of the house?\" Maupassant asked. \"If you like,\" they replied, \"with terrifying expressions on their faces.\" The Frenchman again fled, avoiding Swinburne and Powell thereafter.</p> <p>The account in the Goncourt Journal, as translated and edited by Robert Baldick (OUP, 1962), breaks off at this point. Perhaps for reasons of space, but more likely for reasons of taste in that only just post-Chatterley era, the rest of the French text was excised. In it, Maupassant continued:</p> <p>Yes, they lived there together, satisfying themselves with monkeys or with young servant lads of fourteen or fifteen, sent out to Powell from England every three months or so: little servant boys of exquisite cleanness and freshness. The monkey that slept in Powell's bed and shat in it every night was hanged by the servant boy, partly out of jealousy but also out of annoyance at having to change the sheets all the time.</p> <p>The house was full of strange noises and the shadows of sadism; one night, Powell was seen and heard firing a revolver in the garden at a black man. Those two were real Sadeian heroes, who wouldn't have held back even from crime. Then this house, so full of living mystery, was suddenly silent, suddenly empty. Powell just disappeared, and no one knew how he had got away. No carriage was ever called for him, and no one had met him on the roads.</p> <p>This is a rather novelistic ending, perhaps unsurprising given that Maupassant had had seven years to work up the story, and that it was being both told, and written down, by a fiction writer. At other times he ended the story differently. The 1882 account concludes with Maupassant going back to the Sadeian cottage a couple of years later, discovering that its contents were being sold off, and buying, as a souvenir of the two Englishmen, the parricide's flayed hand. The block of granite had by now been raised into the monkey's sepulchre, and the incident with the revolver is given fuller explanation. It was the young servant who was black, and it was he who was being shot at by an enraged Powell for having hanged the monkey. \"Afterwards, the lad wandered around for days without food or a roof over his head, and then reappeared and began to sell barley-sugar in the streets of Etretat. He was finally expelled from the district after having very nearly strangled a customer who complained about his goods.\"</p> <p>Maupassant's later versions also elaborate on the suspicious protein the Englishmen served. In his 1882 account, he strongly suspects that it might have been monkey, not least because it was said to be common knowledge in Etretat that \"this Englishman [Powell] ate only monkey - boiled, roasted, saut\u00e9ed, or in a confit\". By the time of the 1891 account, Maupassant claims he had knowingly eaten spit-roasted monkey - indeed, the joint had been ordered in his honour from a purveyor of exotic meats in Le Havre. However, \"The mere smell of the dish as I entered the house made me feel queasy, and the dreadful taste of the animal permanently removed all subsequent desire ever again to repeat such a meal.\"</p> <p>This gastronomic queasiness did not imply any broader moral or social revulsion; quite the contrary. Maupassant, doubtless hoping to provoke readers of Le Gaulois, concluded his 1882 account thus: \"The world would be a lot jollier if one came across m\u00e9nages like that one a little more often.\" He certainly played up the theme of the innocent young Frenchman (even if one already alive to Sadeian reference) falling into a nest of genial English perverts intent on displaying national characteristics. Goncourt deliberately drew on Maupassant's description of Swinburne and Powell when writing his novel La Faustin (1882), in which an 18th-century English sadist called George Selwyn not only displays many of Swinburne's mannerisms, but also happens to retire to a cottage on the coast called Chaumi\u00e8re de Dolmanc\u00e9. However, all of Maupassant's versions, despite their dwelling on perversity, are underpinned by deep admiration for the duo: for their literary and artistic passion, their rejection of bourgeois living, their recklessness and bravado. </p> <p>The French have traditionally regarded biography as a rather low form, being either mere gossip, or at best a reductive process, one that tethers the work to the life, rather than recognising the extent to which the work flies free of it. The Anglo-Saxon tradition is more tethering and more moralising; the biographer's overt or tacit intention too often being, as John Updike has put it, to \"reduce celebrities to a set of antics and ailments to which we can feel superior\". Whereas it never occurred to Maupassant to feel superior, or think that Swinburne's extravagant life in any way invalidated, diminished or necessarily coloured his work. This is partly a matter of Flaubertian aesthetics; partly the consequence of how the French saw, and to some extent still see, the British. They think of us as polite, unspontaneous beings trained to such control and self-control that sometimes the lid has to blow off, both in art and life. Hence our personal eccentricities and a line of artistic non-conformity. Contemporary British writers are still being fitted into this historic schema. I remember once trying to keep a straight face when a French journalist, seeking to place me in my proper English context, proposed that my key literary ancestors were Laurence Sterne, Lewis Carroll and Monty Python. Of course I enthusiastically agreed.</p> <p>Maupassant never doubted that Swinburne was a genius. \"He is a poet of exalted and frenzied lyricism, who is not in the least interested in the humble, decent reality which contemporary French artists obstinately and patiently seek; rather he strives to depict dreams and subtle thoughts which are sometimes ingenious and grand, sometimes inflated, but even so magnificent.\" And it was the same when other British writers and artists of the time came up for French description and judgment. The French expected them to behave in peculiar ways, but declined to allow amusement or shock at their habits to affect aesthetic judgment. Jacques-Emile Blanche wrote of Sickert living in Dieppe for \"thirty years, married, divorced, remarried, widower, or about to remarry\", moving between smart society and the obscure lodgings he shared with a red-haired fishmongress, and doing crazy things such as cutting off his hair to surprise a small girl; and in all those 30 years nobody ever saw him paint. None of this stopped the French accepting him as a true Dieppois and a true artist: \"He was to be the painter of Dieppe. No other artist so perfectly felt and expressed the character of the town, whose Canaletto he has become.\" Degas's judgment on Wilde, after the 28-year-old Oscar had visited the painter's Paris studio, was: \"He behaves as if he's playing Lord Byron in some suburban theatre.\" Goncourt called Wilde un puffiste (a braggart, a blagger), and thought even his homosexuality wasn't particular to himself, but imitative, if not plagiaristic: he had copied it from Verlaine, and also from Swinburne. The diarist Jules Renard wrote cuttingly, \"He has at least the originality of being an Englishman\" - the French never quite got hold of Wilde's Irish connection. But while they saw him as a false human being, they judged him a true poet.</p> <p>The British who disembarked at Dieppe the century before last were often surprised by the cheerful affability of the people they encountered. When Hazlitt was staying in Dieppe, \"A man and woman came and sang 'God Save the King' before the windows of the Hotel, as if the French had so much loyalty at present that they can spare us some of it.\" (Hazlitt correctly noted that a reciprocal gesture beneath the windows of a Brighton or Dover hotel would be highly improbable.) A year after the incident at Etretat, Swinburne returned to stay with Powell at the Chaumi\u00e8re de Dolmanc\u00e9 once again. In the town, he was \"rather astounded at finding myself rushed at, seized by the arms and legs, hoisted and cheered, and carried all down the street with shouts of welcome, by the fisher folk and sailors who knew me again at once\". Powell said to him, \"Why, don't you know you're their hero?\" - a status Swinburne thought unmerited by the mere act of not quite drowning.</p> <p>The poet memorialised his time on the Normandy coast in two ways. For the rest of his life he kept the \"outsize garments\" (outsize because he was so tiny) in which the rescuing fishermen had dressed him. And in his 1883 collection, A Century of Roundels, he published a poem called \"Past Days\":</p> <p>Above the sea and sea-washed town we dwelt,<br>We twain together, two brief summers, free <br>From heed of hours as light as clouds that melt<br>Above the sea.</p> <p>The poem is partly a lament - for the dead Powell, and for passing time; also an idyll recreating \"the days we had together\" among \"The Norman downs with bright grey waves for belt\" and the \"bright small seaward towns\". It is singularly lacking in references to monkey meat or Sadeian practices. Despite Swinburne's considerable reputation in France, it seems that he and Maupassant never again met. What Maupassant, or his heirs, did with the flayed human hand is not recorded.</p> <p>\u2022 Misfits in France, a three-part series presented by Julian Barnes and Hermione Lee, will be broadcast on Radio 4 at 11.30am on Thursdays October 23 and 30 and November 6.</p>",

  "<p>David Moyes has revealed his fear over the fading influence of managers in the Premier League and admitted he signed a lucrative new contract with Everton only after being assured his authority would not diminish in the event of a foreign takeover at Goodison Park.</p> <p>The Everton manager finally banished uncertainty over his future on Tuesday when he committed to a five-year deal that has transformed his pay from \u00a330,000-a-week to \u00a365,000-a-week. Negotiations had dragged on for almost a year as Moyes waited on the release of his summer transfer budget and then, having broken Everton's transfer record for a fourth time to sign Marouane Fellaini for \u00a315m, by several contractual issues.</p> <p>A principal reason for the delay, however, was Moyes' insistence that his contract should guarantee a continuation of the autonomous reign he has been granted by Bill Kenwright. The Everton chairman, whose close relationship with Moyes ensured the delay did not dissolve into acrimony, is actively looking to sell the club through Keith Harris of Seymour Pierce, the man also charged with finding a buyer for Newcastle United.</p> <p>Unlike Kevin Keegan at St James' Park, Moyes has enjoyed complete control of football matters, with his remit including all player purchases and sales and even extending to the design of the new \u00a314m training facility at Finch Farm. With a possible takeover on the horizon therefore, the 45-year-old wanted assurances his role would be unaffected by a director of football, for example, before finally signing.</p> <p>\"That was one of the reasons things took a little bit longer. It [a change of ownership] made me have to question things,\" Moyes said. \"I look around football just now and I see situations at football clubs that I'd rather not be involved in. I have a lot of trust and faith in the board here and the club. I want Everton to be run correctly and properly, and I hope that in the six years we've tried to do that. We're trying to improve all the time and behind that is the chairman. We're fortunate in that myself and Bill have a working relationship. It's sad that not many managers and chairman can work together.\"</p> <p>Moyes believes the influx of new wealth into the Premier League has distorted owners' views on how to achieve success and away from the proven structures that have reaped such rewards for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsenal, who Everton face at the Emirates today, under Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.</p> <p>The Everton manager added: \"You look at other clubs with directors of football and head of recruitment and you wonder 'Is this the future? Is this the way that clubs are going?' That's not the way this club has been run. I'm a football manager, I've always had the sole responsibility on how we run the club and the direction the club goes in, and for me that's important. Sir Alex Ferguson has a great saying - 'the manager has to control the football club'. You look at lots of other clubs where the managers aren't in control and other people are. It was never a case of Bill wanting to change how things are run, it was more about me asking what the scenario would be if and when someone buys the club.\"</p> <p>Moyes also revealed that Kenwright hopes to remain involved at Everton even if he does sell his majority shareholding. \"Bill hopes it's the case that he would stay on, but he doesn't know that exactly.\"</p> <p>Despite the current financial limitations and ownership uncertainty, Moyes feels he can fulfil his ambitions at Everton and still hopes to emulate Ferguson and Wenger. Albeit on a fraction of their spending. \"When the time comes for them to leave their clubs they will leave a massive impression on football, a massive impression on how their teams play. I would like to think that by the time I leave Everton I will leave some kind of impression,\" said Moyes. \"You see what's happened at Manchester City and Aston Villa. Maybe in the future they will become the biggest clubs in England. I hope we can become like that over the next five or six years. Look at the squad Everton have got, look at the fan base Everton have got and look at the history Everton have got. I think there would be only three or four managers in the country who would not want the Everton job.\"</p> <h2>Managers v owners</h2> <p><strong>Alan Curbishley West Ham</strong></p> <p>Resigned as both George McCartney and Anton Ferdinand were sold to Sunderland against his wishes.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Keegan Newcastle</strong></p> <p>Transfers and contracts were handled by executive director (football), Dennis Wise, making Keegan \"just the coach\".</p> <p><strong>Juande Ramos Tottenham </strong></p> <p>Chief executive Daniel Levy sold Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane before identifying replacements. </p> <p><strong>Mark Hughes Manchester City</strong></p> <p>He says transfers are within his remit, but what assurances has he that the owners won't swoop for another marquee name in January?</p>",
  "<p>It's Mum's birthday and I'm not spending it with her. I'm away. In Amsterdam, in fact. This is the first time for many years that I haven't been with her on her birthday. I ring before leaving to say sorry that I won't be with her to celebrate her 84th birthday. \"Is it my birthday?\" she says. \"Oh well. I'm not bothered about that stuff. I'm all discombobulated.\" </p> <p>Although it feels strange not to be with her, I am also relieved. It's a time to get away and take stock: of Mum's care, of my exhaustion and my decision to finish the column, which I've been writing since January 2007..</p> <p>My exhaustion is not physical, because others are now taking on more of Mum's care - my brother and sister, and her grandchildren. My exhaustion is mental, the result of the parallel existence that has to be lived trying to keep someone with dementia relatively independent - the organising and paying of carers, the endless appointments, the worrying about Mum's shopping and supplies, dealing with emergencies and, of course, wondering when the next one will strike. </p> <p>The aim of the column was to document what it was like coping with an elderly and increasingly dependent relative. Over the past two years I've become increasingly aware how little the medical profession and social services recognise the reality of looking after people with dementia. I've been with doctors who insist on talking only to Mum, giving her complicated instructions that she'll never follow. I've witnessed hospitals treating Mum as if she is just a collection of different ailments all requiring endless follow-up appointments, which it is assumed she will travel to herself. I've seen the way that there is no coordination or continuity of her care. Most strikingly, I've witnessed what sometimes feels like a convenient blindness as to just how much goes into keeping a dementia sufferer afloat in her own home, what they call \"coping reasonably well independently\".</p> <p>So I need a break. But once away in Amsterdam, I'm assailed by sadness. It's Mum's enthusiasms that keep waylaying me. We're walking in the Hortus Botanicus and all I can think of is how, with her enthusiasm for plants and gardens, she would have loved to be here. Hers has never been the sort of enthusiasm of the doughty ladies who appear on Gardeners' World strolling round beautifully tended grounds identifying plants by their Latin names. Mum has lived most of her adult life in a council flat with a small balcony. But she was always passionate about plants and greenery and nature, and had a strong eye for design. In the 1960s she was one of the first to get a cheeseplant and put it in our G Plan flat. We were the only people on the estate whose flat wasn't all swirls and colours. Mum painted it white and put hessian on the walls, bought Swedish minimalist furniture, and bold plant prints, despising chintz nearly half a century before Ikea. </p> <p>Later in Amsterdam, we go to the Van Gogh museum. He was never one of her favourites but again it's Mum who immediately comes to mind, with the passions she had at one time for drawing and, latterly, art. Like many things she did, her drawing was untutored, but she was naturally able - \"teachable\", as my artist friend would say. She used to sketch branches, trees and flowers so it's Van Gogh's rather Japanese blossom paintings that remind me of her. </p> <p>I buy her a print to take back, but what I really want is for her to be here, for her to be able to enjoy it. Why did I never make the time to bring her? Sadly, Mum never had any confidence - in her intuition, her abilities, her tastes or herself. When we were young, she was always ashamed of our small flat and discouraged us from bringing our \"posh friends\" home. We stayed crammed into this flat even through adolescence with tensions between my parents and us children seething and erupting mainly because my father - prescient man - thought that mortgages were \"immoral\". But Mum hated it and hated domesticity and railed against her fate. \"You can't bring them back to this pigsty,\" she would say, usually in my father's hearing, as a dig at what she felt were his failures.</p> <p>I've long ceased to dwell on those difficulties and have come to appreciate her extraordinary spirit. What she lacked as a mother she more than made up for as a grandmother. Not through gifts, but by \"being there\", offering to take them out, riding the front of buses, taking them to galleries, never judging through adolescent excesses. In return, they all adore her. For all its terrible problems, what this period of dementia - and writing about it - has given me is a chance to process ambivalent feeling and old resentments, something denied to people who lose their parents suddenly. It's like a long, slow goodbye.</p> <p>In spite of beautiful weather in Amsterdam, it's the sadness that clings. Everything reminds me of her. I buy bulbs thinking that I'll plant some for her balcony and then wonder, where will she be next spring? I want so much to take her to places like this and now I'll never have that chance. </p> <p>I only took her abroad twice, once to Venice for a week, which she adored. The children were small and she threw herself into their enthusiasm and pleasures, getting on and off vaporettos just for the hell of it, beside herself with pleasure when on the flight home the pilot invited her and the children into the cabin to go over the Alps. I can still see her expression when she ordered a glass of wine at a stall in the square at Verona. \"It cost 50p,\" she said ecstatically. Her attitude to abroad was like the St Trinian's cartoon that has the girls by a town fountain, one of them saying, \"It's wine!\"</p> <p>The only other time was when she and I had a \"free\" Eurostar trip to Lille. It was brilliantly sunny and brilliant fun, with Mum enthusing round the town. We ended up in the square in the sun with Mum raising her glass - \"This is the life!\" Why didn't I do this more often, I ask myself now? Why was I always so busy?</p> <p>This is why there will be no more columns. Because the person I want to remember is that one, with her enthusiasms and energy, raising her glass to life, greeting most things with \"Oh sooper.\" Already it's becoming difficult. It's as if someone has taken a rubber and smudged the edges off her. So much is about health and illness now, about tussles with the NHS, the horrors in which Mum and her sharp humour find ever fewer opportunities to shine. I feel I've been able to pay Mum tribute not as someone pathetically dependent and old but still with her sharpness intact, and her free spirit, still somehow outfoxing the patronage of the medical institutions and, even in the havoc her condition brings, causing laughter. But if I am to remain truthful, the coming hardships may strip her of this. I want to leave it where, as one reader kindly said, there is still joy among the sadness.</p> <p>If I continued, it would be increasingly with the indignities and decline. Mum herself does not really seem to mind. \"No, no,\" she said the other night, \"write what you like. I'd like to find out about myself.\" But not everyone in my family has seen it that way and I've met some opposition for \"invading her privacy\". I know there are greater difficulties ahead, decisions we will have to take about how she is looked after, how we deal with decline, and sadly there will probably be more family conflict. While I genuinely believe it has been, and would continue to be, a good thing to explore this publicly - because these issues affect so many people now - simultaneously I know that to continue would not leave open the possibility of healing family division.</p> <p>My mind was focused on this when I went to a showing of a film made by a talented Argentinian director about his mother. In his talk he described the problem of \"sacrificing his family\", which he felt was justified by how much he had also given of himself. But in the pub afterwards, someone asked, \"Could you have made it if your mother was alive?\" He hesitated. Another filmmaker there turned to me quietly and said: \"I couldn't. Because of my siblings. They all have different stories of my parents. It's their story as much as mine.\" In the coming, more difficult times, I recognise that it's important that they have their own stories not dominated by mine.</p> <p>Writing this column, I've realised that there is a taboo about being explicit about the process of ageing. This is not so much about death, but about the disintegration, decay and indignities of ageing and the shifts in dependency that come with it. Ageing may be a perfectly natural process, but somehow detailing these changes, and the care needed, is seen as \"shaming\" the person involved, robbing them of their personhood. It can rub off on the writer. I think some people are so horrified by the process that they would rather not have to think about it.</p> <p>In the mid 1980s, when my children were born, I remember the late Angela Carter advising me in typically flamboyant terms never to let newspaper editors hear the children in the background. If they knew I was distracted by caring for children they wouldn't take me seriously. Well, feminism, including Angela herself, changed those attitudes, but not attitudes towards that other caring that goes on unseen, the care for elderly parents. I've sat through several work meetings recently where men have left early. \"I have to pick up the children on Tuesdays,\" they say, striding out with an aura of being \"good dads\". I wait to the end. How would it go down if I said, \"I need to get over to my old mother's to check she's had her tea\"?</p> <p>It will take another revolution like feminism to make society accept that this is something that can't be hidden away, needing as much respect and support as childcare. I know from the large amount of correspondence that vast numbers are affected by this, people who are struggling with the lack of coordinated support for them as carers and the lack of recognition of the needs of the elderly, especially the increasing numbers of those with Alzheimer's and dementia. </p> <p>I've also learned from readers' emails that the seeds of change are there. I've been told about support networks such as the Alzheimer's Association, about new research into caring for dementia. But there's a long way to go before this awareness becomes so powerful that it changes social attitudes and provision. As one reader wrote to me about fighting for improvements to her mother's treatment, \"I'm doing this not for my mother but because this is the fate that awaits all of us.\"</p> <p>Strangely, my mother knew Angela Carter, although she never realised that she was a \"famous novelist\". Our kids were at the same primary school and if my mother collected them she often sat chatting to Angela on the bench outside. </p> <p>It was typical of Angela Carter that she related to my wayward, eccentric mother, another spinner of yarns, who would tell Angela about her wild childhood in the Potteries, the local boys who courted her and the arrival of the mysterious older teacher (my father) who romanced her as a sixth former and then destroyed her spirit, a veritable Bluebeard in the telling. When my daughter was born, Angela suggested I should call her Sybil after my mother who often says of herself, \"I'm a wicked witch.\" Perhaps I should have done but I had inherited my mother's dislike of her own name. As it turned out, it didn't matter. My daughter was a kindred spirit anyway.</p> <p>The birthday present I've left her turns out to be strangely apposite. Earlier in the year at the Chelsea Flower Show I had bought various things bearing this year's insignia - tulips. Not so long ago, before her dementia, Mum had come to Chelsea with me, my partner, John, and my friend Lee. At one point, in true Chelsea style, it poured with rain and we found ourselves sitting watching a brass band playing with rain dripping into our Pimm's, dressed in giveaway macs. We laughed so much at the daftness of it all that we were hysterical, and no one more than Mum.</p> <p>When I ring her from Amsterdam I ask her whether she likes the present from Chelsea and whether it brings back memories of that day. But she doesn't seem to have registered the presents at all. \"Well, there's such a big heap here it might have got lost.\"</p> <p>\"Really?\" I say and I'm wondering if I'm jealous.</p> <p>\"No,\" she says. \"I'm being sarcastic.\"</p> <p>So although we spend her birthday apart, she's on my mind. I feel sad, free, torn. I'm sad I didn't do those things with her I always thought I would one day. I wonder if I have done enough. Happy birthday, Mum.</p>",
  "<p>It was, said the organisers, as historic and radical an act as Emmeline Pankhurst chaining herself to railings outside the Houses of Parliament. But for others a Muslim service led by a woman was sacrilege. </p> <p>Amina Wadud, an American academic, yesterday became the first woman to lead British Muslims in mixed congregational prayers and deliver the Friday sermon. </p> <p>Wadud, who converted to Islam more than 30 years ago, addressed a group of about 15 men and women at the Oxfordshire Masonic Centre. It marked the start of a two-day conference on Islam and feminism but, more significantly, broke 1,500 years of tradition regarding a woman's place in the mosque. </p> <p>Wadud, who received death threats and worldwide condemnation following a similar service in New York three years ago, said: \"There is nothing in the Qur'an or the hadith that forbids me from doing this. The prophet did it himself during his time, when he assigned a woman to lead a mixed prayer.</p> <p>\"This is not a movement, it is just a reality. It is part of the living tradition of Islam, Islam has not died. It is important British women take up the mantle and fulfil the possibility of prayer leadership.\"</p> <p>The Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, which organised the event, anticipated demonstrations and these fears secured a police presence. </p> <p>Wadud, 56, a professor from Virginia Commonwealth University, stressed the importance of prayer. Seeing her flock were outnumbered by the media and sitting away from her, she told them: \"I'm not going to bite you, I promise. It would make me feel better if you were closer to each other.\" They duly shuffled together.</p> <p>Rawand Osman, 25, who travelled from Birmingham, said: \"It's good for the psychology of Muslim men to start seeing women in these positions.\"</p> <p>Taj Hargey, chair of Meco, claimed conservative imams in Oxford threatened to disown Muslims attending the prayers. </p> <p>\"We know 40 or 50 people who were committed to coming but, in the last few days, they had personal visits from mosques, pressuring them not to go, saying their spiritual destiny would be in danger if they did.\" </p> <p>Maryan Ramzy, one of a small group of Muslim women brandishing placards outside, said: \"We have to speak out to try to stop them. You're not allowed to change God's law.\"</p> <p>While there is no text explicitly barring women from leading mixed prayers, women and men do not pray in the same room. The exception is the Grand Mosque in Mecca, thought to be the only place in the world where mixed, public prayers are commonplace.</p>",
  "<p>Susan Hill is arguably too versatile for her own good. As a writer of general fiction, crime novels, children's books and successful ghost stories such as The Woman in Black, her name is solidly well known, but she evades categorisation in a market that prefers its brands clearly defined.</p> <p>Of course, such adaptability should be admired, and The Beacon is an almost perfect little literary novel outside any genre. A cross-generational family story barely longer than a novella, it possesses the light tug of menace and almost invisible haze of tension that characterise Hill's ghost stories, yet there is nothing supernatural about this tale of a farming family grounded in the seasons. The slippery nature of memory is what casts an atmosphere of unease over the novel.</p> <p>The Beacon is a farm in a remote and bleak part of England, a \"distant and uphill place\". Here Colin, Frank, May and Berenice Prime have been raised in a farming family, enjoying a seemingly stable and uneventful upbringing. Their father, like his father before him, expects nothing beyond an existence of hard agricultural labour in which griefs, still births and family oddities are tolerated or ignored.</p> <p>The novel begins with May, a spinster, ministering to her mother during her last minutes of life and running briefly from her death bed \"because she could not bear the dying a second longer\". When May returns from the yard, Bertha Prime is dead, and May is alone in an empty house with only memories and a new burden of guilt.</p> <p>Time is handled as an exquisite layering of chronology that builds the momentum of the story itself, the swirling structure so disciplined that it never confuses. May has been the bright child of the four, her shimmering future a given; Berenice has grown up the family charmer, Colin the farming boy, and Frank the oddity, largely left to his silences. May's academic drive earns her a scholarship and university place, and she fulfils her destiny by forsaking the stultifying backwater of her childhood for London. To her father, by attending university, \"she might have been going to the moon\"; her mother is all pursed-lipped wariness. However, within her first university year, \"the terrors\" have gripped May in the form of visions, sensations, and voices. She can explain neither the cause nor the exact nature of these mental distortions, and she flees back to the Beacon and an unchanging round of filial duties. Only \"the odd flares of memory from that year remained\".</p> <p>While May's siblings Colin and Berenice marry locally, the mute observer Frank pulls off the family's only real escape, to Fleet Street. Once liberated, he is garrulous and ambitious, rising through the newspaper ranks before producing the work that will make his name and fortune while wreaking havoc on his family. Frank's book, The Cupboard Under the Stairs, is a misery memoir expertly attuned to the era of Oprah, reading groups and ever more shocking grief porn. It describes the pitiful childhood of Frank Prime: bullied, abused, and locked in a cupboard in his home. There they all are - Colin, May, Berenice, John and Bertha Prime - named and shamed. </p> <p>The family is utterly bewildered. Shock spills into outrage, despair, and settles into a pained sense of bemusement. Why would Frank invent an entire personal history? Having dredged their memories, the siblings agree that the book is nothing but a pack of howling lies. While neighbours and friends begin to shun the family, Frank's bestselling book is filmed and he becomes a poster boy for a voiceless nation of abused children. Eventually, however, thoughts of these victims begin to haunt him in a way reminiscent of his sister's \"terrors\". </p> <p>The Beacon uses a small canvas, but it examines larger issues of truth, mental health and memory. It is about the almost universal need to shake off the past to forge an adult identity, and it comments subtly on the dynamics of prescribed family roles. The child expected to escape is the one ultimately imprisoned by parental assumptions, male freedom contrasted with female duty. Ideas about wasted lives, about grinding exhaustion at the expense of self-expression and about rank injustice are all here in a novel of great structural and stylistic control. </p> <p>The ending throws up questions about the representation of emotional as opposed to factual truths, and delicately tilts the balance of the entire novel so that the reader is left suspended in an intriguing state of uncertainty, eternally wondering.</p> <p>\u2022 Sleep With Me by Joanna Briscoe is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>Exposure is the third of Mal Peet's novels to feature Paul Faustino, a world-weary football reporter in an unnamed South American country. Faustino is a useful hero, who can go anywhere and ask questions of anyone. He mingles with millionaires at an elegant cocktail party, then plunges into the slums, investigating the murder of a homeless teenager. Faustino has devoted his life to football, amassing a library of cuttings and photos about the world's best players, and a match is the only time that he \"feels as clean as a child, bathed in what he loves\". </p> <p>In each book, Peet has used his journalist hero to explore different aspects of his imaginary country. He has a lot of fun with the incidental details: for instance, the newspapers include El Sol and El Guardian, which is \"only read by intellectuals, leftwing politicians and other people of no importance or influence\". </p> <p>But Peet is also engaged in a serious and intriguing project, gradually building up an enthralling depiction of a fictitious state, complete with its own politics, religion and geography. Its wealth was built by slaves and the culture is still profoundly racist. The Spanish-speaking inhabitants are obsessed by football, which keeps them from thinking too much about their authoritarian rulers or the brutal poverty endured by a large proportion of the population.</p> <p>In Exposure Peet tells several interlinked stories simultaneously, exploring every level of society, showing us the connections between cosy politicians trying to rig an election and skinny kids on the street who earn a few pennies by running errands.</p> <p>The central plot is an updated version of Othello, featuring a celebrity couple - a footballer and a singer - who meet at the beginning of the book and swiftly get married. Otello is a striker who has just moved clubs in a multimillion-dollar transfer; he shares his shirt number with David Beckham. Desmerelda is a pop star whose career shudders to a halt after her marriage, so she turns to fashion instead. Unlike Victoria, she really is posh - she's the daughter of a wealthy politician.</p> <p>To the outside observer, Otello appears to be in control of his own life. In fact, all the important decisions are made by his agent, Diego Mendosa. Peet seems to be saying that this is the fate of the modern celebrity: he has given himself to the world so fully that he has surrendered all volition. But there's an added twist: though Otello doesn't even suspect that he has any enemies, his closest adviser is secretly determined to destroy him.</p> <p>The novel is divided into five acts. Peet prefaces the action with a cast list. He often uses dialogue and \"stage directions\" rather than ordinary prose. Even the minor characters draw their names from the original: Otello's bodyguard and driver is called Michael Cass; Diego's intimate companion is called Emilia; and so on.</p> <p>It's a risky way to write a novel. Anyone who knows Othello will constantly be comparing one to the other. Diego is the character who suffers most by the comparison; he's a much thinner and less absorbing character than Iago, and his motiveless malignity is implausible rather than fascinating. But if you can forget the play - or are a teenage reader who hasn't yet encountered it - Exposure is an exciting, engaging story in its own right, packed with dramatic set pieces and witty insights into celebrity culture.</p> <p>\u2022 Josh Lacey's Bearkeeper is published by Scholastic.

  "<p>He's back. Daniel Craig allays any fear that he was just a one-Martini Bond, with this, his second 007 adventure, the perplexingly named Quantum Of Solace.</p> <p>I've got to admit that this didn't excite me as much as Casino Royale and the villain is especially underpowered. But Craig personally has the chops, as they say in Hollywood. He's made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-cum-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage. If the Savile Row suit with the Beretta shoulder holster fits, wear it. And he's wearing it.</p> <p>This is a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement.</p> <p>Under the direction of Marc Forster, the movie ladles out the adrenalin in a string of deafening episodes: car chases, plane wrecks, motor boat collisions. If it's got an engine, and runs on fuel, and can crash into another similarly powered vehicle, with Bond at the wheel, and preferably with a delicious female companion in the passenger seat - well, it goes in the movie. </p> <p>There are plenty of references to other Bond moments. A horribly dangerous skydive recalls The Spy Who Loved Me. A pile-up in Haiti which spills a macabre lorryload of coffins recalls the voodoo creepiness of Live And Let Die. And, most outrageously of all, the grotesque daubing of a female corpse brings back Goldfinger - though Sean Connery got an awful lot more mileage out of that sort of thing. </p> <p>As in Casino Royale, the famous John Barry theme tune is saved up until the end; a baffling, decision, I always think, not to use this thrilling music at the beginning of the film.</p> <p>Bond has hardly got his 007 spurs, when he's infuriating M, Judi Dench, with his insolence and insubordination. Out in the field, he's whacking enemy agents in short, sharp, bone-cracking bursts of violence when he should be bringing them in for questioning. </p> <p>In theory, he is out to nail a sinister international business type: Dominic Greene, played by French star Mathieu Amalric, who under a spurious ecological cover plans to buy up swaths of South American desert and a portfolio of Latin American governments to control the water supply of an entire continent. As Greene, Amalric has the maddest eyes, creepiest leer, and dodgiest teeth imaginable. </p> <p>Clearly, Bond has to take this fellow down. But he also wants to track down the man who took his beloved Vesper away from him in the previous movie: he is pathologically seeking payback, and to the fury of his superiors, this is getting personal. But it hasn't stopped him cultivating female company in the traditional, fantastically supercilious manner. His companions are as demurely submissive as ever. Olga Kurylenko plays Camille, a mysterious, smouldering figure, out to wreak vengeance on the corrupt Bolivian dictators who killed her family. </p> <p>Britain's Gemma Arterton plays Agent Fields; she greets 007 wearing a trenchcoat with apparently little underneath, like some sort of MI6 strippogram. And she is the recipient of his ardour in the luxury hotel suite - that quintessential Bond habitat. This movie is, in fact, a reminder of how vital hotels are in Bond films, providing the essential narrative grammar: the checking in, the fight with the stranger in the room, the messages left at reception, the luxury cars lovingly photographed outside.</p> <p>I was disappointed there was so little dialogue, flirtation and characterisation in this Bond: Forster and his writers Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade clearly thought this sort of sissy nonsense has to be cut out in favour of explosions. Well, perhaps that is what Bond fans want (not this Bond fan, though). But I was also baffled that relatively little was made of the deliciously villainous Amalric: especially the final encounter.</p> <p>But set against this is the cool, cruel presence of Craig - his lips perpetually semi-pursed, as if savouring some new nastiness his opponents intend to dish out to him, and the nastiness he intends to dish out in return. This film, unlike the last, doesn't show him in his powder-blue swimming trunks (the least heterosexual image in 007 history), but it's a very physical performance. Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I'm 50 and have to drive a lot. In the last few months, glare from the sun and oncoming cars has affected me much more than before. What can I do to lessen my reaction to glare?</strong></p> <p>See an optometrist. Increased sensitivity to glare can be the first sign of a cataract, in which your lens may be clouding over. Also see your doctor. If you are starting to have a cataract at this early age, you need a complete health check for conditions that increase the risk of cataracts, such as diabetes.</p> <p><strong>My 72-year-old brother, who smoked 20 a day, died suddenly last year from an aortic aneurysm in his abdomen. I'm 69 and my doctor has asked me to have a scan to see if I have one, too. Do I really need it? I'm a lot fitter than he was and don't smoke. What are my chances of having an aneurysm?</strong></p> <p>About one in five, regardless of your smoking habit. Your doctor is right. If you do have an aneurysm, it is far easier to treat it before it bursts or leaks than to wait for an emergency. Aneurysms are weak, balloon-like areas in the wall of the main artery in the abdomen. About one in 20 men over 65 have them, but if you have had a near relative with a lethal one, your risk rises. By not smoking, you are likely to have healthier arteries than your brother had, so the surgery, if you need it, should be safer. </p> <p><strong>I conceived my now six-year-old son through ICSI and read recently that it's such a relatively recent fertility treatment, we still have no way of knowing to what extent ICSI babies could be different from ones conceived naturally, in terms of DNA, immunities, etc. Should I be concerned? Is there any research?</strong></p> <p>I don't know any research that has ever shown babies born from laboratory techniques have different immunities from those conceived in the usual way. We don't have definite proof that babies born from ICSI are always unaffected by the process, but it's difficult to see why they should be different from any other baby once they have developed and been born. As for possible changes in DNA, I don't know of any mechanism by which it could be altered by this method of fertilisation. Your son is now six and is presumably healthy in every way.

  "<p>People of Great Britain: your pubs are under threat!\" No, not a line from a 1950s sci-fi flick, but the latest bulletin from the Campaign For Real Ale (Camra). According to new figures, up to 36 pubs are closing their doors every week, an increase even on the numbers for 2007, where a total of 1,409 pubs rang last orders for the final time. Although some of these premises will be reborn as gastropubs or undergo the indignity of a cosmetic nip'n'tuck to re-emerge as swanky cocktail bars, many will face the worst fate of all: being gutted and refitted for sale as flats or offices. It's not just our city centres that are beginning to look like pub graveyards, either. According to Camra's Iain Loe, \"For the first time since the Domesday Book, more than half our villages are without a pub.\" </p> <p>The victims of a triple whammy involving corporate pub chains, cheap supermarket booze and last year's smoking ban - a law which David Hockney described as \"destroying bohemia\"- local pubs across the UK are vanishing. While researching The Rough Pub Guide, I saw countless reminders of this disturbing shift: a once-proud army of Duke Of Wellingtons, Marquis Of Granbys and bedraggled Red Lions standing forlornly by the roadside, defeated by an invincible enemy. Such cultural vandalism has some alarming side-effects too, as a tour around some of the most iconic pubs from stage and screen reveals... </p> <h2>The Mother Black Cap</h2> <p><strong>Withnail And I, 1986</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Classic inner-city boozer where Withnail orders \"two large gins, two pints of cider. Ice in the cider\" as warm-up for an Olympian drinking binge. Local colour is provided by hardcase clientele, eager to vent frustrations on out of work actors. All together now: \"I called him a ponce. And now I'm calling you one. PONCE!\" </p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> After a brief spell spent bearing the name of the fictional pub, the film location is now The Tavistock, on Tavistock Crescent in London, W11, a minimalist gastropub where media types strain to hear each other over the sound of bleeping Blackberrys.</p> <h2>The Railway Arms</h2> <p><strong>Life On Mars, 2006</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Pub excelsis: nicotine-heavy hangout for Gene Hunt and the local CID where Slade are on the jukebox, KP peanuts are on the menu, and there's always a take-out option of Watney's Party Seven. Pubtopia.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Exterior scenes shot at the Angel Inn, Royton, Oldham. Mercifully still a traditional pub, although you hear a lot less Alvin Stardust these days.</p> <h2>The Winchester</h2> <p><strong>Shaun Of The Dead, 2004</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Boozy hub of Edgar Wright's genre-busting rom-zom-com where Shaun (Simon Pegg) and pals fight off lobotomised locals to the sound of Queen's Don't Stop Me Now blasting from the jukebox.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Based on Pegg's favourite pub, The Winchester on <br>Archway Road, N6 (itself since gastroed). The exterior scenes were shot at the Duke Of Albany in Bermondsey, now shut down and being converted into flats. The For Sale sign outside reads: \"One, two or three-bedroom apartments available including garden and duplex units.\"</p> <h2>The Kebab &amp; Calculator</h2> <p><strong>The Young Ones, 1982</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Featured in the infamous episode Boring, the K&amp;C brilliantly reflected a pre-alcopops climate where young drinkers were tolerated rather than tempted. Madness play live to an audience seemingly superglued to their chairs. Welcome to the house of fun, indeed.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Filmed at the Cock O' The North in Bristol, one of only a couple of circular pubs in Britain. The pub reopened following a complete refurbishment in May 2007, and is now called The Westbury Park Tavern.</p> <h2>The Slaughtered Lamb</h2> <p><strong>An American Werewolf In London, 1981</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Inhospitable rural local stumbled upon by ill-fated backpackers, complete with a pentangle on the wall and a cryptic Brian Glover: \"Beware the moon, lads!\" </p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Exterior shots of the \"Lamb\" were shot at a private house in Wales - but the interior scenes were shot at the Black Swan in Effingham, Surrey. A former bikers' pub, it was completely modernised in 2006. Bar snacks now include potted salmon with pickled cucumber.</p> <h2>The Jockey</h2> <p><strong>Shameless, 2004 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> The Star Wars cantina as re-imagined by Irvine Welsh, The Jockey exists as an alternative front room for northern antihero Frank Gallagher, who lives by the motto: \"Stop whingeing. Drink more!\"</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> The Wellington Inn, West Gorton - the inspiration for writer Paul Abbott- was used for exterior shots until 2007. It remains a diamond-hard bedrock of estate-pub fundamentalism. Its chances of being gastroed are remote, though plans are afoot to redevelop the whole area.</p> <h2>The Vick &amp; Comet</h2> <p><strong> Get Carter, 1971</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> An actual boozer on Neville Street in Newcastle. In the smoky Spit &amp; Vomit, heavy-lidded hood Jack Carter (Michael Caine) asserts cultural dominance over the flat-capped locals.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Now an O'Neill's Irish theme pub boasting notices reading \"Cead Mile Failte\" (\"One hundred thousand welcomes\"). As Carter might put it: \"The only reason I came back to this craphouse was to find out who did it.\"</p> <h2>The Coach &amp; Horses</h2> <p><strong>Last Orders, 2001</strong></p> <p><strong>Fiction</strong> Den of male pub solidarity, where Bob Hoskins, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings sing songs and provide \"there's-something-in-my-eye\" reminiscences about departed friend Michael Caine.</p> <p><strong>Fact</strong> Interiors shot at the Larkhill Tavern, Wandsworth, since closed. The exteriors were shot at the Wishing Well in Peckham, SE15; it recently had a makeover as part of Peckham's transformation from inner-city no-go zone to \"urban village\".

  "<p>Maybe it looked too delicious to resist or perhaps the hours of waiting had simply provoked appetites beyond control.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, Iran's eccentric bid to set a world record for making the biggest-ever ostrich sandwich ended when the evidence was eaten by the hungry watching crowds.</p> <p>Organisers were trying to enter the Guinness World Records by producing a 1,500-metre-long (4,921ft) sandwich containing one tonne of ostrich meat.</p> <p>More than 1,000 cooks laboured from early morning in Tehran's Mellat park to assemble the monster sandwich. But as soon as their task was completed, popular enthusiasm overwhelmed the need for attention to detail as crowds began devouring the snack before its measurements could be verified.</p> <p>Chaotic scenes ensued as the sandwich was gobbled up, leaving Guinness representatives who were present unsure if a new standard had been set.</p> <p>With local and international media on hand, organisers hope footage will be accepted as proof that the previous record of 1,378 metres, set in Italy in May, has been broken. \"We still think the sandwich will be recorded because of all the evidence we will send them,\" organiser Parvin Shariati said.</p>",

Use a cutter to cut out scone rounds and put them on a greased baking tray, brush the top with a little milk and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese . Cook for 10-15 minutes, until risen.</p>",
  "<p>If my life was confined to a patch of land 200 metres square, beyond which the environment was either so dangerous or so incomprehensible that I never strayed, it would matter less to me whether or not I ended up in jail. It may be possible in this country to feel freer while imprisoned than not. This is a thought I had when looking at drawings, published this week by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, by young people showing the pitifully small areas in which they feel safe.</p> <p>Two 11-year-olds in Glasgow drew almost identical maps of their locality, but the streets they regarded as safe or unsafe to traverse were mirror images of each other. An 18-year-old in Peterborough drew the sole route he can take to the shops without fearing violence, adding the precise locations of the CCTV cameras that line it. There were no walls to contain them but those created by their own perceptions. </p> <p>Fear overshadows the lives of people growing up in poor and, in many respects, resource-starved areas. There is the literal fear of being attacked, but there's also the fear of the unknown. I have never doubted that your living environment shapes your experience - and, if you're not careful, can come to define and limit it. When the area you consider to be free from threat narrows to a couple of hundred metres, being told that there's a whole world out there sounds like an insult. You know there is; it's just not for you. If it was, there really would be nothing to be scared of. </p> <p>There are remarkably few areas of your life of which you can wrest control, which only increases the scope for anxiety. If you or your parents are housed by the local authority, have no job and few qualifications on leaving school - and therefore little money - the desire for autonomy in at least some aspect of your life has to find some expression. The universal capacity for complex thinking is more likely to be channelled, in the absence of other opportunities, into mapping, classifying and guarding single pages of the A to Z.</p> <p>But, as one of the young people interviewed about their experiences infers, the respect you get from controlling - or appearing to control - an area is as empty as it is instant. It only matters to people whose lives are very similar to yours. It has no standing in the wider world, and they themselves know it; yet still they need something to offer up as their own. </p> <p>For many young people the world truly is their oyster, and this is reflected in the fact that they tend not to expend valuable energy on \"repping their endz\". There are no \"endz\" in sight for those brought up to assume that no experience is closed to them on the basis of who they are. But for many others the outside world is another planet, for all they are equipped to grasp its opportunities. So they act as though it doesn't, and do their best to pretend it doesn't matter. </p> <p>If it was really so great being poor, urban and working class, pride would exist in place of territoriality. The latter is mean, negative, defensive, isolating: instinctively ungenerous. To have pride in your locality suggests there's enough interest and variety in your daily life to consider it worth celebrating. </p> <p>That's not what you see on YouTube, where the kids who cycle in ever-decreasing circles around my old East End neighbourhood paint a brutal, hyperbolic, but nonetheless truthful, picture of the estate they regard as the seat of their identity. There's simply not enough good stuff to go around.</p> <p>You don't need to be incarcerated to live an unfree life. Ignorance, fear and perceived lack of freedom form an endless trapping pattern. \"Not leaving or going anywhere, that's just normal, that's just life. It's the right thing to do,\" a young resident of a north London estate told the Guardian this week in response to the JRF's findings. </p> <p>Who needs bricks when you can build walls in your head?<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A good week to bury good news. During the financial crisis, ministers have inverted New Labour's notorious first law of spin. On Monday the pernicious plan to imprison suspects for 42 days was decisively dumped. On Tuesday sinister plans for secret inquests with no jury were quietly put on ice. The same afternoon the children's secretary, Ed Balls, finally listened to the critics' chorus - which came from parents, teachers and educationists alike - and axed the hated Sats for 14-year olds, which are mandatory in England.</p> <p>The tests were introduced in 1993, with three aims: injecting rigour into education, assessing pupil performance and monitoring schools. As a gauge of schools, the 14-plus was always superfluous - the benchmarks that mattered were tests at 11 for primary level, and GCSEs for the secondary phase. By this summer, when botched administration by the outsourcing firm ETS Europe resulted in 1 million pupils getting their marks late, it was painfully plain that the 14-plus tests were serving no purpose at all. The chaos catalysed a new wave of resentment, one which proved as powerful as it did only because of deeper anxieties.</p> <p>Arguably, ETS Europe ended up with the contract precisely because the tests had little educational rationale: two of the three big exam boards thought marking the scripts was a box-ticking exercise, and so declined to bid for the work. More fundamentally, the run of formal exams - at 11, 14, 16, 17 and 18 - reduced schooling to a series of hurdles. That system has made youngsters unduly anxious and - as university teachers increasingly complain - produces school-leavers who are less comfortable with thinking for themselves than being spoon-fed with exam technique. Tony Blair's former right-hand man, Matthew Taylor, recently summed up the consensus neatly: \"Too many schools are drab, joyless assessment factories.\"</p> <p>Ditching the uniform Sats at age 14 is a welcome response to this reality, as is the accompanying suggestion of a report card for schools, which would cover extra-curricular activities as well as exam results. Questions remain about the tests at 11, which suffer from similar defects. Outright abolition is trickier here, as these do have a role, albeit a questionable one, in assessing primary schools. If these tests are to be retained, though, there must be a rapid move from the stressful one-size-fits-all regime towards a new model - which is already being trialled - that lets teachers decide the level at which individual pupils are ready to be tested. </p> <p>The unexamined life, Socrates said, is not worth living. This week ministers belatedly recognised that the overexamined life of the young is not as worthwhile as it should be.</p>",

  "<p>We know election day is approaching when Republicans start screaming about voter fraud, but the McCain campaign has reached a new low and the death rattle of the Republican party has entered its last violent spasm. At this week's debate John McCain accused the Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now (Acorn) of \"one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy\". His running mate, Sarah Palin, warned that they were trying to \"steal this election\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-republicans-acorn\">These kinds of allegations</a> are absurd and obviously false and the McCain campaign knows it. It is McCain himself that is damaging to our democracy because it calls into question the legitimacy of our election process in a deceitful way. </p> <p>Voter fraud and voter registration fraud are two different things and they are being deliberately conflated for political purposes. Voter fraud is simply bogus. Study after study, and major nationwide enforcement efforts by the department of justice and other enforcement agencies in the states have never, ever produced any evidence of anything more than a handful of cases, and I mean two or three, of actual voter fraud. The failure of many US attorneys to actually find cases of voter fraud to prosecute was the motivation for Karl Rove to push a scheme to fire nine of them and the resulting scandal ultimately led to attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/27/usa.marktran\">Alberto Gonzalez's resignation</a>. </p> <p>Voter registration fraud is real, but the kinds of allegations about Acorn are actually frauds perpetrated on Acorn and not the political process. Organisations that engage in voter registration drives are required by law to submit every registration form that they receive, no matter how obviously fraudulent the information. That law is in place as an extremely important protection for the process so that organisations are not able to go on a mass registration drive and then throw out all the Republican registrants or Democratic registrants before they submit the forms to the state government. They have a responsibility to flag those forms that they believe are fraudulent or invalid, but they cannot disqualify them on their own. For example, <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/\">Acorn</a> goes and registers 100,000 people in Ohio out of which they identify 5,000 registration forms that are clearly phony that they flag, but they have to turn them in anyway. Then Republicans go around spreading malicious stories about Acorn turning in thousands of fraudulent registrations, but they know Acorn is required by law to turn them in and they know that those registrants will never be added to the voter rolls.</p> <p>Acorn is uniquely susceptible to these kinds of problems because it engages in the questionable practice of paying its organisers by the number of people they register. I can understand why they do this \u2013 to give unemployed or low-income people a paying job \u2013 but it opens them up to fraud perpetrated on them by paying for sham registrations. They believe that the multi-layered system of first flagging questionable registration forms and then having the voting agencies provide further checks is adequate protection against actual fraudulent registrants ending up on the voter rolls and the benefits of helping these people earn a living outweigh these risks. </p> <p>The reason why voter registration fraud does not lead to actual voter fraud is that voter fraud is hard and voter registration fraud is usually very transparent. The charges flying around right now \u2013 people registering as Mickey Mouse, or a guy filling out 73 registration forms \u2013 are simply not credible as voter fraud. It would require us to believe that an election board would place Mickey Mouse on the rolls and poll workers would then allow someone to vote who is claiming to be Mickey Mouse, or to allow the same person to vote numerous times. That is just ridiculous and impossible to imagine occurring in the real world. </p> <p>For systemic voter fraud to occur, the organisers of such an effort would need hundreds if not thousands of people to participate in a massive conspiracy to show up at the polls claiming to be someone else (a felony) who had been fraudulently registered and placed on the rolls, they will often now need to have a government issue photo ID with that other person's information (another felony), then actually vote for the chosen candidate in a secret ballot, and then keep this massive clandestine conspiracy hidden in the face of numerous investigations designed to uncover that very situation. It's even harder for systemic mail-in voting fraud because the ballots can only be mailed to each voter's registered address meaning that hundreds of households would need to be part of this conspiracy that adds mail fraud to its list of felonies. It's more likely that Mickey Mouse would be allowed to vote than systemic voter fraud to occur undetected.</p> <p>Republican officials know this. They know that this election cycle has seen an unprecedented surge in new voter registrations and that those registrations have been disproportionally Democratic. They are raising the spectre of imaginary voter fraud to further their efforts to disqualify a large number of those registrations through cumbersome requirements that elections boards cannot complete by November 4 to fix a problem that does not exist. It is a deliberate effort to delegitimise both their probable defeat and, combined with despicable efforts to portray Obama as a supporter of terrorism, an Obama presidency. Should Obama win, a large percentage of the country will think that he is a terrorist supporter who conspired to steal the election, that will present a real governing problem for Obama. The reason they will believe that outrageous suggestion is that the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates have told them it is true. This from the man who claims to put country first.</p>",
  "<p>A 23-year-old rugby player who represented England as a teenager has committed suicide in a Swiss euthanasia clinic after he was paralysed from the chest down in a training accident. Police are investigating.</p> <p>Daniel James, who was a hooker with Nuneaton rugby club, felt his body had become a \"prison\" and lived in \"fear and loathing\" of his daily life, his parents said tonight after they accompanied him to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/switzerland\">Switzerland</a> from their home in Sinton Green, near Worcester. </p> <p>He had tried to kill himself several times since a scrum collapsed on him in March last year, dislocating his neck vertebrae, trapping his spinal cord and rendering him instantly tetraplegic.</p> <p>West Mercia police have launched an investigation into his assisted suicide, which took place on September 12. Details were made public for the first time today when police published a statement relating to an ongoing inquest. </p> <p>The practice is illegal in the UK and family or friends who help can face up to 14 years in jail. Officers have questioned a man and a woman in the case and are preparing to submit a report to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p> <p>James' parents, Mark and Julie, said their son was \"an intelligent young man of sound mind\" who was \"not prepared to live what he felt was a second-class existence\".</p> <p>James is one of the youngest Britons to have travelled abroad for assisted suicide. Earlier this month, Dignitas, the centre for assisted dying in Zurich, said 100 Britons have travelled to Switzerland to make use of its more liberal laws. It is thought James attended a clinic in Berne.</p> <p>James was a talented player who had seemed destined for a professional career in rugby union. He played for England at under-16 level and went on to play for Loughborough University, where he was an undergraduate engineering student. </p> <p>The training accident happened four days after he helped England Students beat a France side in Oxford. In a special training session for forwards, he was practising a scrum when the rest of the pack came crashing down on him. Under their weight, he dislocated the vertebrae in his neck and trapped his spinal cord, which paralysed him from the chest down in an instant.</p> <p>In the following weeks he underwent several operations and spent eight months in rehabilitation, including at Stoke Mandeville hospital, before returning home. He only ever regained a small amount of use of his fingers and early last month he travelled to Switzerland. His funeral took place in the UK on October 1.</p> <p>\"His death was an extremely sad loss for his family, friends and all those that cared for him but no doubt a welcome relief from the prison he felt his body had become and the day to day fear and loathing of his living existence,\" the James family solicitors said in a statement tonight. </p> <p>\"This is the last way that the family wanted Dan's life to end but he was, as those who know him are aware, an intelligent, strong-willed and some say determined young man. The family have suffered considerably over the last few months and do wish to be left in peace to allow them to grieve appropriately.\" </p> <p>The Spinal Injuries Association expressed shock at the suicide. \"When someone has an injury like this you think it's the end of the world because life is going to change for ever,\" said Daniel Burden, the head of public affairs. \"But our mantra is that life need not end if you are paralysed. We know of people with similar or worse injuries than Dan who have lived fulfilling lives. A lot of people I have spoken to here are shocked he has taken his life.\"</p> <p>The case comes as Debbie Purdy, a 45-year-old sufferer of primary progressive multiple sclerosis, awaits a high court judgment seeking clarification of the legal status of family and friends who accompany people who commit assisted suicide. </p> <p>Her action is being supported by Dignity in Dying, which campaigns for a law change to allow terminally ill and mentally competent patients to choose assisted death in the UK. James, who was not terminally ill, would not have been eligible under any such alteration of the law. </p> <p>Prior to his death, James' uncle, Mark Roebuck, who started the Dan James Trust, which raised nearly \u00a325,000 for spinal research, paid tribute to his nephew.</p> <p>\"On Monday March 12th Dan was just like thousands of 23 year olds, full of life, hope, excitement and dreams. His life at university was full, active and successful, surrounded by fantastic mates with the promise of employment in construction management if his rugby career had not continued to blossom. Whatever he chose to do, he would have done it with his usual good humour and lovely nature that have made him the loveable young man that he has grown in to. He truly was on the threshold of life and he lived his life to the full and embraced every opportunity that came his way.\"</p> <p>The messageboards on <a href=\"http://www.nuneatonrugby.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=1\">Nuneaton rugby club's website</a> were full of tributes today. \"This is really sad and tragic news, and it makes all the silly arguments with the rugby and football club very trivial and unimportant,\" said Nutty Nun. \"My thoughts, sympathy and prayers are with Dan's family. RIP Dan.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Who is running? </strong><br>Democratic senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> of Illinois and Republican senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a> of Arizona are the major party candidates. Their vice-presidential running mates are Delaware senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> and Alaska governor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, respectively. </p> <p>Also running are Ralph Nader, the liberal consumer advocate whom Democrats blame with spoiling the 2000 election by siphoning votes from Al Gore and Cynthia McKinney, a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia who is running on the Green party ticket. Former Georgia Republican congressman Georgia Bob Barr is running on the Libertarian ticket, hoping in part to win over conservative gadfly Ron Paul's backers.<br> <strong>How were Barack Obama and John McCain chosen as their parties' nominees? </strong><br>They were nominated by a vote of delegates to their respective national conventions in the late summer. They earned the support of those delegates by winning the long series of primary caucuses and elections held in the winter and spring. The Democratic nomination also need to be secured by the allegiance of party insiders and elected officials known as \"superdelegates\". <strong>So whoever gets the most votes on November 4 wins?</strong> <br>No. US presidential elections are awarded to the winner of what is known as the electoral college. Under the system, each state is allocated anywhere from three to 55 votes according to its population. </p> <p>The winner of the popular vote wins a state's electoral votes - with two exceptions, Maine and Nebraska, which award electoral votes by district. The candidate that wins 270 electoral votes takes the White House. <br> <strong>What happens if the winner of the electoral college has tallied fewer popular votes? </strong><br>This has happened three times in US history, most recently in 2000. Under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/constitutionandcivilliberties\">US Constitution</a>, the presidency nevertheless goes to the candidate who wins the electoral college. <br> <strong>What are the most important states?</strong><br>California, New York and Texas offer the most electoral votes, with 55, 31 and 34 respectively. But those mammoth lodes are not up for grabs: the first two states are safely Democrat, and Texas has voted Republican every year since 1976. The candidates typically spend most of their time in a handful of large \"swing states\" that could vote either way, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/florida\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ohio\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>. <br> <strong>When do Americans vote?</strong><br>Election day is November 4, but many states allow voters to cast a ballot before then.  <strong>Why vote early?</strong> <br>Voters like early voting because it adds convenience and precludes having to wait on a long queue at the polls. This year, the Obama campaign is encouraging supporters to vote early to mitigate the chances of a late McCain surge in momentum. Research shows early voting does not dramatically increase turnout, as early voters would have cast a ballot on election day anyway.  <strong>How many Americans vote?</strong> <br>US citizens must be at least 18 years old and be registered with their local elections supervisor in order to vote. In 2004, 64% of voting-age citizens cast a ballot, up from 60% in 2000. This year Americans are expected to vote in record numbers, in large part because Obama has energised young voters and African-Americans in unprecedented levels. </p> <p><strong>What is the vice-president's role in the campaign? </strong><br>Vice-presidents run alongside presidential candidates on the party ticket. They have few official governing duties under the Constitution, and it is often joked that the most important day in a vice-president's career is the day he (or she) is brought onto the campaign. During the campaign, vice-presidential running mates are often tasked with attacking the record and character of the opposing presidential candidate, and this year Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Sarah Palin have embraced that role.  <strong>What does the president actually do? </strong><br>The president is commander in chief of the US military, sets foreign policy and negotiates treaties, oversees dozens of executive agencies and departments, signs bills into law and submits a budget to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/congress\">US Congress</a>. </p> <p>The president also appoints federal judges including new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/supremecourt\">US supreme court</a> justices. From the White House \"bully pulpit\", the president can wield extraordinary influence over legislation. <br> <strong>Who can run for president? </strong><br>The Constitution states only that the president must be a \"natural born citizen\", at least 35 years old and have resided in the US for 14 years.  <strong>John McCain was born in the Panama Canal zone. Is he a \"natural born citizen\"? </strong><br>The term has been widely interpreted to mean people born in the US, although the Constitution does not define it. </p> <p>Politicians in Washington are in broad agreement, however that McCain is a natural born citizen because he was born on a US military base in a US territory and his father was in the US navy. The Senate in May passed a resolution affirming that McCain is eligible to be president. <br> <strong>My friend in America wants to run for president. How does he go about doing this?</strong> <br>It is very, very difficult to run for the highest office in the nation. With the noteworthy exception of Barack Obama, serious presidential contenders have typically spent decades positioning themselves for a White House run, building political support by winning lower office, campaigning for other candidates, assembling coalitions of supporters and financiers, and mapping an electoral college strategy. </p> <p>Presidents and major-party nominees often fail their first attempt. Richard Nixon lost to John Kennedy in 1960 and spent the next eight years out of office, plotting his return to power in 1968. John McCain sought the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost to George Bush. He soon began positioning himself for this race. <br> <strong>How did Barack Obama manage to put himself in contention after less than three years in the Senate and eight years in the Illinois legislature? </strong><br>Obama first gained national attention in 2004 as a candidate for Senate in Illinois. He made a well-received speech at the Democratic convention that year, and struck party faithful with his charisma and his call for an end to divisive partisan and racial politics. </p> <p>But his relative lack of experience was a top issue for his opponents for the Democratic nomination. <br> <strong>Running for president sounds expensive. How much have the candidates spent so far?</strong> <br>Up until the end of August, McCain and the Republican party had spent $197.4m on the campaign. Obama and the Democrats had spent $391.4m.</p> <p><strong>How do they raise so much money?</strong><br>An individual may donate only $2,300 per election to a presidential candidate, so the campaigns rely on \"bundlers\" - well-heeled and influential people who can gather checks from large numbers of wealthy associates on behalf of the campaign. Obama's campaign this year has raised large sums of money in small contributions from a broad network of supporters, while McCain's campaign has relied on a smaller number of big checks. The political parties may take up to $28,500 from an individual every calendar year, but the federal government restricts how much they can spend in coordination with the campaign.</p> <p><strong>McCain and Obama are both senators. Do candidates always hold this office? </strong><br>No. In fact, the last sitting senator elected president was John Kennedy in 1960. Americans prefer electing governors or former vice-presidents, largely because governors have executive experience that is in many ways analogous to the presidency. Former vice-presidents have already stood on the national and international stage.  <strong>What else is up for grabs? </strong><br>The whole of the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100-member Senate are elected every two years, so those seats are up on November 4. Plus 11 states will hold elections for governor.  <strong>I won! Now what? </strong><br>The next president will be sworn into office on January 20. In the meantime, the president-elect will this year have one of the most urgent transition periods in history because of the fast-changing turmoil in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>. The president-elect will immediately begin naming his cabinet and preparing to take the reins in the White House and in the executive agencies. <br> <strong>How much does the president get paid? </strong><br>The president is paid $450,000, including a $50,000 per year expense fund. </p> <p><strong>That does not sound like very much, considering the power and prestige of the job. </strong><br>The president does not have to pay rent, or for meals and transportation, and takes holiday at Camp David, a retreat in the mountains of Maryland. Also, former presidents make large sums on book deals and speaking fees.  <strong>The White House sounds like a pretty neat place to live. </strong><br>It is. It is one of the most secure places in the entire world. The 200-year old mansion has had several additions and renovations, and every president has put his own stamp on the interior. For the president's off-hours, the White House features a tennis court, jogging track, swimming pool, movie theatre and bowling alley.</p>",
  "<p>An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/australia\">Australian</a> historian wanted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> for alleged Holocaust denial \"never sought to cause offence by his work,\" an extradition hearing was told today. </p> <p>Fredrick Toben, 64, was arrested at Heathrow airport on October 1 over allegations that he published material on the internet \"of an anti-Semitic and/or divisionist nature\". </p> <p>The German-born historian, who was travelling from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\">United States</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dubai\">Dubai</a>, was detained by Scotland Yard's extradition unit after an EU arrest warrant was issued by the district court in Mannheim, Germany. It was alleged that between 2000 and 2004, Toben posted information online that denied, approved of or played down the mass murder of six million Jews by the Nazis. </p> <p>Ben Watson, representing Toben, told the hearing at Westminster magistrates court, in London, that Toben \"never sought to cause offence by his work\" and he was \"not right-wing or a nationalist\".</p> <p>Watson said his client \"always understood that he was free\" to pursue his research, which he described as establishing \"the precise facts around the Holocaust and other academic events that are taboo\". </p> <p>Toben's lawyer questioned the validity of the EU warrant, saying his client should only be extradited if he committed the offence while \"standing in Cologne market place or had posted the claims on a German website\".</p> <p>Melanie Cumberland, prosecuting, said there was enough information within the warrant to suggest that a full extradition hearing should take place: \"The conduct alleged against this defendant is clearly indicated in the application.\" </p> <p>She said that the offence of Holocaust denial was not specifically against the law in the UK, but offenders could be prosecuted under anti-racism laws. </p> <p>The district judge Daphne Wickham remanded Toben in custody until a further hearing on October 29 when she will give her judgment on whether the case should be thrown out.</p>",
  "<p>A would-be suicide bomber who died after a failed attack on Glasgow airport chanted prayers as he was engulfed in flames, a court heard today.</p> <p>Kafeel Ahmed, 28, soaked in petrol and on fire, fought police officers who attempted to put out the flames after he drove a burning Jeep Cherokee into Glasgow airport's main terminal building last June.</p> <p>Ahmed stepped out of the vehicle after it became trapped in metal railings. He died from severe burns several weeks later in hospital.</p> <p>Two NHS doctors, Mohammed Asha, 28, and Bilal Abdulla, 29, are on trial at Woolwich crown court accused of launching the attack at Glasgow airport and planning car bomb explosions in London.</p> <p>PC Stewart Ferguson, who was picking his parents up from the airport on the day of the attack, told the court he tried to put the flames out using a fire extinguisher. \"He thereafter lay down on his back and raised his hands to the air almost as if in prayer. He was chanting some kind of prayer,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I would say it was not normal speech. It was more of an audible prayer. I could not understand some of the words, but it was an impassioned prayer. He had his hands in the air lying back chanting, but the only phrase I could make out was 'Allahu Akbar' [God is greatest].\"</p> <p>Ferguson told the court that as he tried to put out the flames, Ahmed got up from the floor and tried to fight off police who were trying to restrain him. He was brought under control after being dragged to the ground by a number of people including police officers who used CS gas, Ferguson said.</p> <p>The witness said he went to the aid of a uniformed colleague who was fighting with Abdulla, who is accused of being the passenger in the jeep. He was \"wild eyed\" and \"extremely agitated\" Ferguson said, and he too shouted Allahu Akbar as he threw punches.</p> <p>Another member of the public, Michael Kerr, ran to assist Ferguson and described to the court how he severely fractured his leg and lost a tooth during a vicious fist-fight with Abdulla.</p> <p>PC Gordon McKenzie, who ran to the scene after receiving a radio call for assistance, told the court that Abdulla was standing with his back to the car with his arms spread \"like a goalkeeper\". McKenzie said he tried to get Abdulla to move away from the vehicle.</p> <p>\"I fixed eye contact with the man and as I'd talked to him he moved left and right. It was exceptionally unusual behaviour,\" he said. \"I could not say at that time I had informed an impression of what his intentions were. Having asked him to come towards me, I beckoned him in case he could not understand and the man turned left and ran into the building.\"</p> <p>He said Abdulla was arrested after officers used batons to hit him on the shins and legs. \"He was completely tensed up. He was a big man. It was difficult, we could not make an impression to take him down and we resorted to hitting him with the baton. It had an effect after a number of times and strikes to the legs. </p> <p>\"He went down to his knees and we managed to get him in the prone position and handcuffed him, hands to the rear and we double-locked it,\" McKenzie said. </p> <p>The court also heard details of how the desperate car bomb attack unravelled. A taxi driver, William Gibson, told the jury how Ahmed tailgated him to get past control barriers and gain access to the restricted road close to the terminal.</p> <p>Another taxi driver, Brian Roan, remembers \"the tremendous focus\" of Ahmed as he revved the engine after hitting the terminal. \"He was expressionless,\" Roan said. \"He was staring straight ahead, not left or right, just straight ahead. He did not look like he was in a panic, not like he was in a crash, just straight ahead and determined.\"</p> <p>Ian Caldwell, the taxi rank marshal and one of the first at the scene, said the car was impaled on low metal railings. He described how the spinning tyres created clouds of smoke before the occupants began throwing petrol bombs.</p> <p>Earlier in the trial, the court was shown CCTV footage of Ahmed trying to fight off police and members of the public while doused in burning petrol.</p> <p>Asha and Abdulla deny charges of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life between January 2006 and July 2007. The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>Fears that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/insurance\">Britain's insurers</a> could be forced to call on shareholders to boost their finances sent stock prices tumbling today despite assurances that the industry remained in good shape.</p> <p>Insurers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/avivabusiness\">Aviva</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/prudential\">Prudential</a> suffered the biggest falls as shareholders panicked over the effects of an economic downturn on investments held by the two groups. </p> <p>Aviva lost more than 12% of its value after a similar fall on Thursday, while Prudential fell 10% after a 20% drop the previous day.</p> <p>Some investors said they were concerned that insurers faced the same collapse in confidence that undermined the credibility of the banks. </p> <p>Both firms said their finances remained robust and they had sufficient reserves to chart their way through deteriorating economic conditions.<br>Regulators are understood to be in regular touch with all the UK's 130 life insurance offices and have insisted they test their solvency against further steep falls in the stock market.</p> <p>Prudential had a surplus of \u00a31.4bn in the summer and it is understood it would take a fall of more than 40% in the market from the end of September before it needed to consider boosting its reserves. Aviva, which owns Norwich Union, had \u00a31.9bn of surplus capital in June.</p> <p>Insurers must set aside spare capital to cover guarantees attached to retirement annuities and with profits policies. The capital is largely invested in corporate bonds, which are considered a safe haven except when a sharp economic downturn forces corporates into insolvency.</p> <p>Most bonds held by insurers are AAA rated and invested in large stable businesses, but about \u00a3105bn of the \u00a3237bn sterling corporate bond market is issued by banks. Property companies are also large bond issuers and their fortunes have collapsed in the last years.</p> <p>Upmarket estate agents Savills said today that its profits were likely to more than halve this year after commercial property deals fell off a cliff two weeks ago. It said any life left in the commercial property sector drained away after the Lehman Brothers collapse. </p> <p>While the government has so far worked to protect bondholders in banks, investors remain nervous that the turmoil in the markets could yet get beyond the control of governments and regulators. They also fear other seemingly robust businesses are set to go bust if the western economies suffer severe recessions next year as many economists expect.</p> <p>But other sector watchers and industry sources said that while further stock market falls would dent insurers' finances, recent changes in the way regulators set their capital requirements meant that dramatic declines would be required to force dividend cuts or rights issues. </p> <p>Leading insurance analyst Ned Cazalet said the finances of insurers were overhauled in 2004 following the near collapse of the industry in 2003. <br>He said some insurers that have invested in property and equities to cover guarantees on annuities and with-profits policies could be forced to merge or seek extra capital by the regulator.</p> <p>However, he said the situation was unlikely to mimic the problems faced by banks after insurers were obliged to hold enough capital to meet their obligations to policyholders, plus an additional buffer to cope with unexpected shocks. The leading UK life insurers hold an extra layer of capital on top of this. </p> <p>In 2003, a sustained stockmarket downturn forced insurers to sell part of their equity holdings in order to maintain their capital strength. The disposals further exacerbated the stockmarket slump. In the aftermath, the Financial Services Authority toughened its capital rules for insurers. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Aviva refuted a Goldman Sachs analysts note questioning whether the firm could afford to pay its dividend at the end of the year. </p> <p>She said the firm paid its dividend out of operational earnings which were \"on track\". She said earnings increased 7% at the half-year stage. \"While no industry is immune to the turmoil in the stock markets, our capital reserves are robust,\" she said.</p>",

He is a great loss to his family and friends and the people he served.\"</p> <p>Ross's defence barrister, Donald Findlay QC, told the court Ross believed he was innocent, not a racist, and that his conviction was a \"great loss\" to his family and country.</p> <p>The murder was the first on Orkney for 25 years and today's verdict ended a 14-year quest for justice.</p> <p>The procurator fiscal for the Highland and Islands, Andrew Laing, described the murder as \"callous\" and said the \"cowardly act\" had shocked the local community and Scotland.</p> <p>\"Prosecutors and officers from Northern constabulary were determined that justice would be done in this case,\" he said. \"Many people have worked on this investigation over the years and all will be satisfied with today's outcome.\"<br> Laing thanked the \"great public spirit\" of people who came forward from Kirkwall, the administrative centre of the Orkney Islands and its largest settlement.</p> <p>A Northern constabulary spokesman said: \"The sentencing today finally brings a conclusion to a long and difficult period for the family of Shamsuddin and the community in Orkney.\"</p> <p>Despite circumstantial evidence, the crime went unsolved until a new witness came forward last year and Ross was convicted. His father, Eddie Ross, who was a 57-year-old policeman on the island at the time, spent four years in jail for covering up vital evidence. He was stationed outside the restaurant after the killing.</p> <p>0n June 20 this year the jury found Ross guilty by majority verdict after a six-week trial.</p> <p>After the verdict was read out, Ross leapt over the witness stand and fled through the side exit at Glasgow's high court.

  "<p>The OECD <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/5\">bursts the banks of normal diplomatic nicety</a> with its public denunciation of Great Britain's behaviour in its <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/8/0,3343,en_2649_34487_41515464_1_1_1_1,00.html\">latest bribery report</a>. </p> <p>The UK claims to be fighting corruption, and regularly lectures African countries and the like about the need to clean up their act and stop taking bribes for arms and engineering contracts. But the OECD anti-bribery international working party party and its feisty Swiss chairman, <a href=\"http://www.baselgovernance.org/about-us/foundation-board/mark-pieth/\">Professor Mark Pieth</a>, have drawn up a report that depicts the behaviour of the UK administration itself as, in effect, corrupt.</p> <p>The report paints a picture of a Labour government that spent many years, under Tony Blair, obstructing justice, evading action and making a series of dishonest promises about its non-existent intention to pass legal reforms. Ministers' real intentions, it would appear, were to do nothing that would inconvenience British business and its traditional methods. </p> <p>None of this will come as a surprise to students of history. The government archives at Kew contain the formerly top secret cabinet records of the Callaghan Labour government of the 1970s, at the time of the great overseas bribery scandals involving US arms companies like Lockheed.</p> <p>Behind closed doors at Chequers, Labour ministers admitted that British companies were themselves also paying big bribes to get contracts, and so were nationalised aerospace, engineering and shipping firms for which Whitehall was directly responsible. What was to be done?</p> <p>The answer, it was readily agreed, was to hush up the truth, while stalling international efforts at reform for as long as possible. British exports, and the jobs of British voters, were more important to Labour ministers than ethical considerations or international reputation. </p> <p>It would appear that absolutely nothing has changed. And the exceptionally exasperated language of the OECD report is there because the OECD has no power to make Britain change. It only has the power to name and shame, when Britain flouts the terms of the international treaty outlawing overseas bribery, to which it has ostensibly signed up.</p> <p>The 75-page OECD report is a detailed analysis of British shortcomings \u2013 lack of political will, archaic laws, under-funded investigators and interfering politicians. But it focuses on two key areas, one looking backward and one forwards.</p> <p>The backward look is at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bae\">BAE affair</a>, which the Guardian can take some credit for first bringing to light. The Serious Fraud Office then tried to investigate the case, after this paper published evidence that millions of pounds in secret payments were being distributed by one of the world's biggest arms companies. </p> <p>The then prime minister, Tony Blair, aided and abetted by a compliant attorney general, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/bae.tonyblair\">personally intervened to stop</a> a criminal investigation into BAE, on the grounds it was upsetting the company, and upsetting the Saudi royal family, who had received many hundreds of millions of pounds in secret payments.</p> <p>The then director of the SFO, Robert Wardle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/18/bae.armstrade\">was bullied into closing down</a> the case. It marked a new low in the degeneration of British justice, and the OECD report slips in illuminating fresh details of how it was done.</p> <p>As far back as December 2005, BAE was writing \"private and confidential\" letters to the attorney general, trying to get the case against the company dropped. BAE said the Saudi ambassador, Sir Sherard Cowper-Cowles, was busy meeting the Saudis to try and promote the new Typhoon deal and pave the way for a sales trip by the then defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. (This was the same Cowper-Cowles who later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/31/bae.armstrade2\">unblushingly assured</a> the head of the SFO that British lives would be at risk from Saudi terrorists if the case was not dropped.)</p> <p>BAE also recruited ministers and officials to put pressure on the SFO. They wrote in the same month that there was \"a high risk the Saudis would take their business elsewhere, at the least the Typhoon procurement, if not the maintenance of the existing equipment\". </p> <p>But as well as rehearsing the sordid story of BAE's grant of impunity, this OECD report also looks forward. It makes clear that the fundamental touchstone of British good intentions in future will be whether the government makes good its endlessly delayed promise to reform the law on corruption, and turn it into an effective instrument for corporate discipline. </p> <p>The omens are not good. Jack Straw, justice minister, and the third successive, and hapless, \"anti-corruption champion\" to be nominated by the government, has not responded by making a definite promise to legislate, with a firm timetable. Without that commitment, all the government's words will be seen as worthless by anti-corruption campaigners.</p>",
  "<p>The moral basis of the Conservative party's education policy is a belief in the innate worth of every individual. Every child has a talent to be nurtured and we fail, in ethical terms, if we neglect the potential of any young person. We also fail, economically too, because in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/unemploymentdata-economics\">chillier employment climate</a> of the future there will be fewer and fewer jobs for those young people without good qualifications.</p> <p>That is why so much of our party's research effort in education over the last 18 months has been driven by our anger at the waste of talent we see in a system where the gap between the performance of the richest and poorest is diverging. We published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/16/secondaryschools-gcses\">data this week</a> which highlighted the shocking scale of inequality between the best and worst performing areas. In one Bradford neighbourhood, just 3.3% of pupils reach the government's target of five good GCSEs including English and Maths, while it is only 7.2% in one Nottinghamshire area and 8% in parts of Hull. </p> <p>The government claims it is closing this attainment gap, yet its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/16/gcses-secondaryschools\">own GCSE data</a> published on Thursday shows that the gap has widened since last year. While under 30% of pupils in Hull and Knowsley get five good GCSEs including English and Maths, it is over 60% in Sutton, Trafford and Redbridge. </p> <p>Schools should be many things \u2013 great places to work and wonderful environments in which to grow up \u2013 but they must, crucially, be engines of social mobility. Schools exist to help young people overcome the disadvantages of birth and background through hard work, talent and great teaching. But the current system just <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article4951691.ece\">isn't allowing that to happen</a>.</p> <p>We believe that's because this government, instead of trusting professionals and empowering parents, has preferred to centralise, constrict and bully. Whether it has been their ever more prescriptive approach to the curriculum, their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/15/sats-schooltables\">mishandling of assessment</a> or the clumsily intimidatory way they went about tackling under-performance through the National Challenge, ministers have taken a Whitehall-knows-best attitude to everything.</p> <p>Well I don't think I know best. I think heads, teachers and parents know best. Which is why we want to shift power away from Whitehall and back into civil society. We want to empower heads with more powers to enforce discipline, enhance teachers' security with anonymity when facing malicious allegations, liberate all teaching staff with a less prescriptive curriculum and reduce teaching to the test with fewer, more rigorous, exams. </p> <p>We also want to see great leadership and innovation rewarded. We've campaigned to draw attention to the brilliant teaching in the best comprehensives and we propose to offer high-performing comprehensives the same freedoms from bureaucracy academies currently enjoy. There's one condition \u2013 they have to show how they would use their freedoms to help another, under-performing school. It is autonomy within a culture of collaboration. And it helps advance our progressive Conservative mission of liberating the strongest specifically to help those who are weaker.</p> <p>We're applying the same progressive radicalism when it comes to helping parents in the poorest areas. We have been impressed by the educational gains made in social democratic <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schools/swede-dreams-the-tories-controversial-plans-for-school-reform-955014.html\">Sweden</a> since they introduced school reform 15 years ago. They've allowed parents to take the money currently spent by local authorities and take it to new schools, set up within the state system, by new charities, foundations and others. In a country one-sixth the size of England they've seen 900 new schools open. </p> <p>Standards in the new schools have risen, and their presence has helped improve all schools in areas those areas where they operate. We want to replicate the same virtuous dynamic here, and we would apply the same funding mechanisms which have been so successful. We want, however, to spend more to concentrate the benefits of reform in poorer areas. Which is why we've said we would introduce a pupil premium, with children from more disadvantaged backgrounds having more spent, per capita, on their education. It is a direct incentive for new schools to locate, and expand, in the areas of greatest need. And it means teachers in those areas can be better rewarded for the work they do.</p> <p><em>This article replaces an earlier version that was published at 11:30 on Friday October 17.

  "<p>Normally, it would have been a dire week. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation</a> rose to a 16-year high of 5.2%, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">jobless total</a> hit its highest level in 17 years, and there was gloomy news from the high street and the housing market. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">United States </a>was in equally bad shape. Consumer confidence, according to figures out today, has suffered its sharpest one-month fall to date as the public digested the implications of four weeks of mayhem on Wall Street.</p> <p>But these are not normal times. In London, Washington, Paris and Berlin, there is a sense that the week could have been a lot worse; in fact, that the world was back from the abyss. </p> <p>When Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned last Saturday that the world's financial system was \"on the brink of systemic meltdown\", he was voicing the views of every central bank governor and finance minister attending the gloomiest and most crucial meeting of the Fund for a generation. </p> <p>The talk in the corridors of the IMF's 19th Street offices in Washington was of what could be done before markets opened on Monday morning to prevent the collapse of the entire western banking system and a descent into a 1930s-style slump. </p> <p>The emergency package hammered out \u2013 first in Washington and then in Paris \u2013 averted the catastrophe. Markets remain nervous, share prices have ballooned up and down, and the mood in the City and on Wall Street has remained downbeat as traders have woken up to the notion that the global economy is heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">recession</a> \u2013 and probably a big one at that. </p> <p>But Adair Turner, the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), spoke for many this week when he said the events of last weekend would prove to be \"a watershed\". </p> <p>Contingency plans were put in place last week for the worst-case scenario. The reason that the chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the Bank of England governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Mervyn King</a>, will sleep easier this weekend is that apocalypse has been averted. </p> <p>For the present, the sense of relief goes no deeper than that.<br>Friday October 10 was a day of blind panic on the London stock market. Bank shares were hammered, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> losing a quarter of its stock market value. The once-proud Edinburgh-based bank was worth almost \u00a360bn a year ago, but as the City closed for business today, it was valued at just \u00a311.5bn. </p> <p>It was clear to the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA that the crisis in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking industry</a> had not been solved by Darling's announcement two days earlier of a grand bail-out plan to inject much-needed capital. By last Friday, febrile markets were searching for details about which banks would need to raise capital and by how much.</p> <p>Officials from the Treasury and FSA issued a summons to the banks to find a solution before the markets opened on Monday. </p> <p>It was not just bankers that spent a weekend locked away. Lawyers, accountants and top City investors were all engaged in a frantic attempt to end the uncertainty and put a size on the capital cushions the banks would need to appease regulators worried about the financial strength of the banking system.</p> <p>The mood was bleak. So were some of the contingency plans being considered by the authorities to ensure some semblance of calm could return on Monday. </p> <p>Darling had been at the IMF meeting in Washington on Friday but left early to deal with the crisis at home. A number of contingency arrangements were discussed, with consideration given to suspending stock markets. </p> <p>In London, \u00a3250bn had been wiped off the value of the top 100 shares in the previous week. The fear was that the market would go into a death spiral if fears about the strength of the major banks could not be abated before Monday morning. </p> <p>Even if stockmarkets did not need to be closed in their totality, discussions were held about halting trading in bank shares which had been dragging the wider markets lower. </p> <p>Consideration was also given to calling an emergency bank holiday such was the level of anxiety about how bank customers would respond to further falls in share prices of the banks holding their savings. </p> <p>While cash machines would have probably kept dispensing money, banks would have closed their doors for the day to give themselves breathing space.</p> <p>In the event, such drastic steps were deemed to be unnecessary. The deals hammered out with RBS, HBOS, Lloyds and Barclays on Sunday night with the new City minister, Paul Myners \u2013 described by one banker as \"not so much a meeting as a drive-by shooting\" \u2013 provided officials with enough confidence to believe markets would be reassured.</p> <p>Stockmarkets soared on Monday and strains in the world's money markets also started to ease. </p> <p>It proved a temporary reprieve; by the middle of the week, shares were on the slide and again and, by Thursday night, the FTSE 100 was lower than it had been the previous Friday. </p> <p>That was not the end of a rollercoaster week: a late rally on Wall Street allowed the FTSE to claw back above 4000 points and close modestly up on the week. Amid fears that next year could see the economy contract for the first time since 1991 and unemployment surge well above 2 million, there was concern about insurance companies, hedge funds and pension funds. But the banks are thought to be safe \u2013 for now at least.</p>",
  "<p>When asked to write an article about my black hero, I was attracted to the likes of <a href=\"http://www.nkrumah.net/\">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.zulu-culture-history.com/shaka_zulu_life.htm\">Shaka Zulu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/16/race-blackhistorymonth\">Martin Luther King</a>, to name a few. But in reality no one had made a greater impact on my life as my father, the late ambassador, D D Obunge. Although born in quite humble circumstances in Abonnema, an small Nigerian village, this man was to rise to become a pioneer and one of Nigeria's finest ambassadors.</p> <p>I recall a story of how my dad had once been held at gunpoint in the embassy in Sweden and on refusing to lie on the floor he was struck with the butt of the gun. Although the offenders \u2013 who were Nigerians \u2013 were caught by the Swedish authorities, he asked for them not to be repatriated and punished but rather that they be forgiven. To my amazement these same men where invited to our family's annual Christmas party! Such acts of love and reformation illustrated my father's life and influenced mine.</p> <p>He was a well-known philanthropist and heaven alone knows how many other children, including his own nine, he assisted with scholarships. He was fondly called \"daddy\" by many whose life he had touched.</p> <p>He gave me every desire to emulate him, and his life was later to influence my work in the Peace Alliance and my passion to see people from all walks of life succeed despite the odds.</p> <p>Our family prayed together every morning and night. More than anything else my father instilled in us a strong belief that we gain our identity from who we are rather than from other people's assumptions of us.</p> <p>Unlike the comic heroes who never die, at his death I realised I was not merely burying my dad but my hero. However, he had left a legacy that lives on.</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire media mogul <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupertmurdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a> today railed against British regulators for dealing a \"huge injustice\" to BSkyB over a potentially costly bust-up surrounding the broadcaster's minority stake in rival ITV. </p> <p>Speaking at the annual meeting of his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/newscorporation\">News Corporation</a> empire, Murdoch attacked the Competition Commission for ordering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bskyb\">BSkyB</a> to cut its 17.9% stake in ITV to less than 7.5%. </p> <p>\"The purchase of those shares in ITV was totally within the law,\" said Murdoch. \"It's a huge injustice that Sky has suffered and it's still subject to court review.\" </p> <p>The commission decided last year that BSkyB's substantial interest in ITV was anti-competitive and against the public interest. The ruling was backed by the former business secretary John Hutton and it was upheld by an official appeals tribunal last month. </p> <p>Murdoch told investors that BSkyB ought to be able to own up to 20%, citing a ceiling imposed by the 2003 Communications Act. </p> <p>He said he issue had been \"parked up with various quangos and committees\" and was not yet final. BSkyB is considering whether to take the issue to the appeals court. </p> <p>BSkyB bought the stock for \u00a3940m two years ago to foil a takeover of ITV by Virgin Media. It has been forced to write down the value of the investment by \u00a3616m because of a plunge in ITV's share price and BSkyB executives are deeply reluctant to sell at a depressed price. </p> <p>Addressing shareholders at New York's Hudson Theatre, Murdoch delivered a gloomy assessment of the global economy, acknowledging that the credit crunch has \"weakened advertising markets and beaten down our share price\". </p> <p>He insisted that News Corp's diversified interests and strong balance sheet left it well prepared for a downturn but said: \"2009 may be a year of unprecedented challenges - we cannot fool ourselves into pretending otherwise.\" </p> <p>There was little dissent among the 50 or so investors present except for a question over the appointment to News Corp's board of Natalie Bancroft, a 28-year-old opera singer, to represent the Bancroft family which sold the Wall Street Journal to Murdoch last year. </p> <p>An Australian shareholder activist asked if the meeting could hear from Bancroft on \"what values she adds to the board\", while another investor questioned whether she would stand up to her all-male, middle-aged boardroom colleagues. </p> <p>Murdoch replied that Bancroft, who lives in Europe, had already visited all branches of the company, saying: \"She's one of the most diligent new directors I've ever seen.\" </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian at the meeting, Bancroft said her tender age was a strength: \"I'm young - this is a company driven by a younger market. I think I bring a youthful perspective.\" </p> <p>She declined to say how much time she was devoting to News Corp: \"I'm not calculating it in terms of days per month. I'm spending time on both of my jobs.\" </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>The French government is to take sanctions against one of the country's biggest savings banks, the Caisse d'Epargne, after it suffered a \u20ac600m (\u00a3465m) loss on unauthorised equity derivatives trading.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, finance minister, today ordered an emergency audit of all French banks after the Caisse indicated that a team of four or five traders, since disciplined, exceeded their limits. \"She wants to make sure that what happened does not happen again,\" her spokesman said.</p> <p>They were caught out in last week's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\"> stockmarket crash</a>, when panic seized traders and investors, by what the bank called \"routine control procedures\". The positions were immediately closed, the Caisse said.</p> <p>Lagarde said she was \"particularly frustrated and depressed\" by this latest incident of unauthorised trading to hit French banks as the country's banking commission began an investigation into the incident.</p> <p>The Caisse, which is merging with Banque Populaire to form France's second-largest retail bank and is known as \"the Squirrel\", is the third to be stung by losses caused by rogue traders.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/04/banking\">Societe Generale</a>, took a \u20ac4.9bn hit on up to \u20ac50bn of futures positions allegedly run up by Jerome Kerviel while Credit Agricole last year lost \u20ac250m through a rogue trader based in the US.</p> <p>Lagarde said the government had been informed of the Caisse losses late on Thursday after being told of the incident the evening before.</p> <p>Ministers had then been steering legislation through parliament to set up the new bank refinancing company which has up to \u20ac320bn to guarantee bank loans - the latest European government to follow the British lead in bailing out banks in the wake of the credit crunch, with the German parliament approving the country's \u20ac500bn rescue package today.</p> <p>Lagarde's comments came after she attended the first meeting of the refinancing company which is chaired by former IMF managing director Michel Camdessus. France has also set aside \u20ac40bn of capital to inject into any ailing banks but has repeatedly insisted its banks are \"sound and robust\".</p> <p>The Caisse , which was already closing down its proprietary trading desk, earlier this month denied reports it was seeking a \u20ac6.5bn capital injection to offset huge trading losses. SocGen and semi-nationalised municipal lender Dexia issued similar denials this week.</p> <p>In a statement it said: \"In view of the size of its capital base - more than \u20ac20bn - and its substantial liquidity, this loss has no effect on the financial strength of the group and will have no impact on its customers.\"</p> <p>It is understood that an assistant of the rogue traders' team leader, Julien Carmona, has been dismissed. Others have been moved to different jobs.</p> <p>The French rogue trading came to light as Charlie McCreevy, EU internal market commissioner, ordered a regulatory crackdown on parts of the opaque $600 trillion derivatives market.</p> <p>Gordon Brown earlier this week urged global action to control the so-called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trading market which accounts for the vast majority of the total market and takes place between two parties off-exchange, largely to limit foreign exchange or interest rate risks.</p> <p>McCreevy, pointing to the surge in credit default swaps (CDS), said the OTC market could cause \"new tremors\" in current fragile market conditions if one of the parties involved could not meet their liabilities.</p> <p>He indicated that there should be a central clearing house for \"standardised\" derivatives and he could table EU legislation along these lines before the end of the year. \"No one is able to say how these swaps (CDSs) will unwind. Regulators have little sight of the potential liabilities that could be building up for individual participants,\" he said.</p> <p>Separately, Deutsche Bank confirmed that its executive board had agreed to waive any multimillion bonuses this year. The decision, affecting 10 directors, including Josef Ackermann, chief executive, who earned \u20ac14m last year, and Anshu Jain, City-based head of global markets, who earned even more, could more than halve the \u20ac97m they earned last year.</p>",
  "<p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama tout their green credentials on the campaign trail, but today their frequent absences from Congress doomed them to abysmal ratings on a leading US environmental group's annual scorecard.</p> <p>The League of Conservation Voters has ranked the environmental commitment of members of Congress for 37 years on its annual scorecards, which tally votes that legislators take on green issues. Missed votes detract from one's score, however, which proved bad news for Obama and McCain.</p> <p>Obama missed nearly all of the League's environmental \"key votes\" this year due to his whirlwind campaign schedule, earning an 18% green rating. His score during 2007, when a primary battle against Hillary Clinton also pulled Obama away from Washington, was 67%.</p> <p>But even those diminished rankings were better than McCain's. The Republican nominee, who depicts himself as a conservationist, got a 0% score for the second straight year after missing every vote tallied by the League.</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain voted on the US Senate's climate change legislation, which was defeated in a test vote in June. Although both men submitted public letters declaring that they would have backed the carbon-emissions plan, the absence still counted against their score for the League's purposes.</p> <p>Even if the presidential nominees had shown up to vote on the climate proposal, however, it still would have fallen 10 votes short of passage.</p> <p>Tiernan Sittenfeld, the League's legislative director, noted ruefully that Congress had scored a promising environmental victory last year, agreeing to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in decades.</p> <p>\"The success of 2007 should have led to even more progress in 2008,\" Sittenfeld added in a statement, \"but a vocal minority of big-oil allies instead turned the year into a series of missed opportunities and major steps backward.\"</p> <p>Members of Congress who seek the White House commonly miss the overwhelming majority of legislative votes while campaigning across the US. John Kerry missed so many Senate votes during his bid to unseat George Bush in 2004 that one government watchdog group tried to force him to give back his congressional salary.</p> <p>But rarely do those missed votes make the difference between success and failure for major legislation. When a package of clean-energy tax credits came within one vote of passage in December, McCain was the only senator missing from the Capitol \u2013 although he was in Washington at the time. </p> <p>McCain joined David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, as the only senators receiving 0% ratings from the League this year. Seventy members of the House of Representatives earned zeroes. </p> <p>Among the senators receiving perfect 100% scores, all but one are Democrats. The exception to that trend is Susan Collins of Maine, whom the League has endorsed in her difficult re-election fight against Democratic challenger Tom Allen.</p>",
  "<p>I note that <strong>Jo Burgin</strong>, a former executive with <strong>Al Jazeera English</strong>, has lost her \u00a31m employment tribunal claim against the channel. </p> <p>She had alleged that she was unfairly dismissed, and suffered discrimination on the grounds of sex, race and religion or belief while working as head of planning at the channel's Qatar headquarter for two years until April 2007. </p> <p>Evidence given on her behalf against Al Jazeera was headline news early last month. Coverage reached a crescendo when her husband, <strong>Steve Clark</strong>, who was the channel's director of news, told the London hearing that <strong>Ibrahim Helal</strong>, the deputy managing director, was sexist and anti-Western, with the \"mangerial skills of Saddam Hussein\".</p> <p>A couple of things strike me about this. First, the coverage suggested a willingness to accept Burgin's views because they fitted the relentless anti-Arab/anti-Muslim narrative of the Britain's press in recent years. </p> <p>Here was a woman claiming discrimination partially on the grounds that she was a Christian from the West. She must be right.</p> <p>Well, our job is to report what is said at a public hearing, so covering it was fair enough. However, Al Jazeera's argument - which prevailed as far as the tribunal was concerned - got much less space with smaller headlines. </p> <p>For the record, its point was that journalistic staff felt Burgin's managerial style was harmfully affected by her being Clark's wife. As a result she was offered a role in a different department, but refused to accept it. </p> <p>Second, the tribunal's decision in favour of Al Jazeera was hardly covered at all. As far as I can see, only three papers bothered to mention the fact that Burgin lost her case (the London <strong>Evening Standard</strong> in print, <strong>The Guardian</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/16/tvnews-television\">online</a> and <strong>The Times</strong> <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4956732.ece\">online</a>).</p> <p>There used to be an informal rule that when covering court cases - and an employment tribunal is rather like a trial - the verdict was <em>always</em> published. </p> <p>It is surely the case that Al Jazeera's reputation has been muddied by this affair, despite it having been declared the innocent party. Perhaps the editors serving on the code committee that reports to the <strong>Press Complaints Commission</strong> might like to think about adding a clause to the editors code of practice to deal with this kind of oversight.</p> <p>That said, removing anti-Arabic and anti-Muslim prejudice from newspaper decision-making can only hope to succeed if more cases like this are brought to light.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Dublin. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Laura Izibor (vocals, piano). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> According to the contestants on X Factor, the most influential performer of the last 40 years isn't Elvis, it isn't the Beatles, it's probably someone like Ruby Turner or Joss Stone. How else to explain the legions of Brit-born wannabe American R&amp;B divas queuing up to demonstrate their vocal prowess and gospel fervour, all those possessed young females who mistake pyrotechnics and melismas for sincerity, passion and soul? Laura Izibor, a 20-year-old soul-singing songwriter and pianist from Dublin, is no stranger to talent contests, actually. Having been introduced to the piano at 13 (\"Hello, Mr Piano,\" she said. \"Hi,\" it replied, tentatively, somewhat terrified of the imminent pounding and vocal onslaught), in February 2003 the precocious warbler, aged just 15, entered, and won, Ireland's prestigious 2FM Song Contest before making Irish music history in 2006 by becoming the first unreleased artist ever to be nominated for a Meteor Irish Music Awards, Ireland's equivalent to the Brits. She won that, too. <br> Because she's really quite talented, see. Impressive, even; impressive enough, in fact, to have been invited to open concerts for the good (Angie Stone, the Roots), the great (James Brown, Al Green) and Jamie Cullum. If you don't happen to have an Irish passport, her music may already be familiar to you anyway, because her tracks have appeared in films such as PS I Love You and TV shows such as Grey's Anatomy and MTV's The Hills. And she wrote all those tracks herself, which is one step up from the cover-versions-and-autocue brigade. And some of those tracks aren't half bad, or they could reasonably be described as authentic facsimiles of the real thing. From My Heart to Yours, her first single, wouldn't sound out of place tucked away on side two of a Lauryn Hill or Alicia Keys album. Other songs from her own entirely self-penned album, which she also co-produced and was recorded in Dublin, New York, Atlanta and Philadelphia, have the mellifluous tunefulness of a Mica Paris record at least. But Candi Staton, Roberta Flack, early Aretha Franklin and some of the other all-time legends she's being compared to? We're not so sure.  They're going mad for her in Ireland. \"The soul of Ireland,\" was the headline of one Irish newspaper article. \"Laura is undoubtedly one of the greatest voices Ireland has ever produced, a brilliant soul singer, an exceptional performer and a fine songwriter,\" continued the journalist, froth appearing at the corner of his mouth. \"She is also strong-willed, confident and brave.\" Brave?

  "<p>It was inevitable that Australian actor-writer-director Matthew Newton would end up in showbusiness. As the son of Australian television royalty Bert and Patti Newton, Matt is a household name in Australia, but still relatively unknown outside his home country.</p> <p>That's set to change if he keeps making <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">films</a> of the calibre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126366/three.blind.mice\">Three Blind Mice</a>, which is screening at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a> this month.</p> <p>Three Blind Mice \u2013 which won a jury commendation at this year's Sydney film festival, and was shown at Toronto last month \u2013 is a fast-paced comedy-drama about three naval officers on shore leave in Sydney, the night before they are due to ship out for Iraq.</p> <p>It's a clever, well-made film with smart, realistic dialogue that belies the fact that its only Newton's second film as a writer/director. It was independently funded \u2013 although Screen Australia paid for the print - and was made with a cast and crew made up of Newton's friends and recent graduates of the Sydney Film School. It was even edited by Newton's girlfriend, Gracie Otto (sister of actor Miranda), who also has a small role in the film. </p> <p>\"It's a gamble, but what you get out of it is a film you're happy with and a film you want to see,\" he says.</p> <p>The idea for Three Blind Mice, with three vastly differently personalities out for a night of revelry, was one that Newton had been mulling over for a while.</p> <p>\"I was thinking about having that truncated period of time before you are going to go and do something phenomenal - like fight in a war, a huge life-changing experience - and what you would want to do to fill those last hours, or what you'd HAVE to do,\" he says.</p> <p>\"So I was thinking about that, but not in terms of a film \u2013 just as one of the weird things that I think about. I was doing an acting job at the time, so I put it to the back of my mind. And then one night I went to the computer and wrote it really quickly. It came out in three days, and that was what we shot.\"</p> <p>I'm sitting chatting to Newton over a coffee at his London hotel. As he speaks, his passion for film \u2013 and for this project in particular \u2013 sparkles in his eyes.</p> <p>He's very critical of a lot of the mass-produced cinema we see today, and was adamant that he wanted to do something different.</p> <p>\"I tried to write it so the dialogue is very natural, and every scene has multiple points of view,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I didn't want to make a hero-driven film, I wanted to make it multi-narrative in the sense that every character has their point of view and I wanted every character to treat the film like they're the lead. I really wanted everyone to bring their own opinion and personality.</p> <p>\"And I guess I also wanted to show what young men should be doing with their evenings as opposed to going and getting killed or having to kill someone else \u2013 making mistakes, getting in trouble, meeting girls, playing cards, trying to figure out what it is to be a man.\"</p> <p>For the three main characters, though \u2013 Dean (Toby Schmitz), Sam (Ewen Leslie) and Harry (Newton) - it's not a normal night out. They are about to ship out to a war zone, and they are fully aware of where they are going and what could happen to them. Although it's not, strictly speaking, an anti-war film, Newton did intend the spectre of war to hang over proceedings.</p> <p>\"The argument of whether we should or we shouldn't be fighting is irrelevant: we are,\" he says of the current conflicts in Iraq and elsewhere.</p> <p>\"It's not irrelevant to everyday politics, but I don't want to make a film about that. We are going there, and there are young men and women who are being sent over to fight, and I guess what I wanted to do was to show the human face of that. So that anyone who sees the film strips past the uniform and looks at that face.</p> <p>\"I made a film that I want people to argue about, and have opinions on. It's impossible to make a good film that's trying to please everyone. It's like trying to pick up a person in a nightclub, trying to be everything they want you to be. You know when someone's playing you. I hate people trying to manipulate me and I certainly hate trying to manipulate other people. I didn't want to make a film that tried to manipulate anybody.\"</p> <p>Newton is proud to be classified as an independent filmmaker, and critical of a lot of films now that call themselves independent but aren't. His love of film came from sitting and watching classic movies on television with his father, Bert \u2013 an Australian television legend comparable to Bruce Forsyth in the UK or Dick Clark in the US.</p> <p>\"I didn't understand a lot of it when I was really young, but by the time I was 10 or 11 I was starting to have my own opinions on it.</p> <p>\"So I went, 'Well, I want to do that, I want to make those films'. And then when I started working [as an actor] I realised that the person who has the most fun and most responsibility is the director \u2013 they get to do everything. It was something I always knew I wanted to do.\"</p> <p>Coming from a family of performers, Newton says he had no exposure to directing \u2013 so in his early days as an actor, while sitting around on film and TV sets, he watched directors to learn the craft. \"That was my education. I'd just watch what was going on, and bother people.\"</p> <p>Newton has managed to assemble a cast of old and young Australian talent \u2013 talent like Pia Miranda (who he worked with on the coming-of-age drama Looking For Alibrandi), Barry Otto, Marcus Graham, Jacki Weaver and Charles Tingwell.</p> <p>Did his family background have any influence on getting the great cast, or has it helped in his career?</p> <p>\"I'm the wrong person to ask, I don't know why that would. I'm not being coy, I have no understanding of it, I'm the one person who's not part of the conversation \u2013 I'm never in the room when those things are being talked about.\"</p> <p>And what's next for Newton? He's heading back to Australia to begin work on a new TV series, but film-making is now in his blood.</p> <p>\"I want to keep making films \u2013 the best drug for me on set was collaborating with people, and helping them do something they didn't think they could do. It's a very heady feeling. Making films is what I want to do. I've been spoiled, because I've made this film the way that I want to make it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 22 2008. Gracie Otto is the sister, not the daughter, of Miranda Otto. </p>",

  "<p>Theatre and film are a bad mix. As a theatre journalist, I'm sometimes sent DVDs to give me an idea of shows that are coming my way from abroad. I rarely watch them. Film has such a deadening effect on theatre that I reckon I'm better off imagining a production than seeing it killed on screen. <br> There are several reasons for this. Foremost among them is that film is a realistic medium where theatre is metaphorical. It jars on screen when we see actors pretending to be someone or somewhere they are not. In theatre, we expect such pretence - what else is there? We understand that the opening scene of any production will establish the rules of the make-believe game we are going to play. In theatre those rules are always changing; in film they rarely vary. Consequently, the conventions of cinema find it difficult to cope. Then there are practical problems. In the theatre, we do our own editing, choosing the long-shot and the close-up as we see fit. In film, the editor is in control of what we see and it takes a special sensitivity to a play's rhythms - not to mention access to a variety of camera angles \u2013 to be able to emulate the experience of sitting in an auditorium. Throw in the question of spatial relationships and of theatre's wordiness and it's not surprising film tends to make such a clunky job of it. It's the same in reverse. Theatre often makes a bit of a hash of film, although there are exceptions. Last week at the <a href=\"http://www.dublintheatrefestival.com/\">Dublin Theatre Festival</a> I caught up with Katie Mitchell's <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/23945/podcast-episodes/katie-mitchell-on-emwavesem.html\">Waves</a> and, although my reaction was not dissimilar to that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/nov/17/theatre\">Michael Billington</a>, I can only agree with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2006/dec/04/wavessetsahighwatermarkfo\">Lyn Gardner</a> that it's a rare example of film being as live and spontaneous as everything else on stage.<br> Another exception is the newly released DVD of <a href=\"http://www.johnwilliamsproductions.com/products/product_info.asp?ProductID=468\">Black Watch</a>, the National Theatre of Scotland's much talked about show that's about to end its tour of duty in New York. I won't claim it deserves a cinema release, although it has already been broadcast by the BBC in Scotland, but as theatrical documents go, it is tremendously effective. I'd strongly recommend anyone who didn't see this fantastic production to give it a watch.<br> Nothing beats the live experience, of course, but even those who did see it on stage will appreciate details the camera makes apparent. John Tiffany's production, performed in drill halls and sports centres with the audience on two sides of a wide playing area, was very much in long shot. If the film loses some of that sense of spectacle, it gains in the intimacy of the close-up. It makes no pretence at being \"real\" - the audience is frequently in view, the stage is a stage, this actors' voices echo - but by filming it twice, once with an audience, once without, it allows for a wide variety of shots and a filmic rhythm that matches the energy of the show. It's almost enough to convince me that good editing and sensitive direction is enough to make theatre work on screen. But is it a one off?</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/08/thecrusaderreturns\">Nadine Dorries</a> and the pro-life brigade hijacked the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/humanfertilisationandembryology.html\">human fertilisation and embryology</a> (HFE) bill earlier this year, significant parliamentary time was given over to debating the anti-choice amendments they'd submitted to it. Thankfully, their desperate attempts to turn back the clock on women's reproductive rights <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/21/health.stemcells\">failed</a> during the nail-biting Commons vote that followed, and when the bill gets its third and final reading next Wednesday it's highly likely that they'll lose the argument again.</p> <p>But even though Dorries has submitted exactly the same amendment as before, proposing <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmbills/120/amend/pbc1202506a.2843.html\">a reduction</a> in the abortion time limit to 20 weeks, the debate next week shouldn't just be a re-run of the one that took place in May. While there's no doubt that the anti-abortionists will be trotting out the tired and discredited arguments they used the last time around, and that Dorries will once again be waxing lyrical about <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/2008/05/14/nadine-dorries-mp-and-her-hoax-science/\">miracle foetuses</a> that can survive outside of the womb before they've even been conceived, there are other, <a href=\"http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/images/stories/0809briefinglores.pdf\">more progressive amendments (pdf)</a> up for discussion, ones that give MPs the welcome opportunity to finally modernise UK abortion law.</p> <p>Strange, then, that the government seems so intent on shutting down this crucial debate. And stranger still that they've apparently been <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/3203333/Plans-to-legalise-abortion-in-Northern-Ireland-shelved.html\">busy telling</a> pro-choice MPs to forget any ideas they might be harbouring about supporting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/23/northernireland.law\">Northern Ireland amendment</a>, a change that merely seeks to give the women of Northern Ireland the same freedoms and rights as the rest of us.</p> <p>There were rumours back in June that Gordon Brown had <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4116811.ece\">done a deal</a> with the Democratic Unionists in order to secure the vote on 42 days detention, rumours that at the time both Brown and the DUP denied. But while it might be hard to believe that Brown really did promise no interference in the province's abortion law in exchange for votes, and that women's rights are held so cheaply by our prime minister that they can be auctioned off to the highest bidder, this week's shenanigans have surely put paid to any lingering doubts that might have remained on that score. The women of Northern Ireland have <a href=\"http://www.thefword.org.uk/blog/2008/10/northern_irish\">been sold out</a>, and the one remaining chance to secure the same abortion rights for all UK citizens has been lost. Brown should hang his head in shame.</p> <p>And it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>Not content with denying the women of Northern Ireland a voice, it would appear that Brown is working hard at <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1078046/PM-clashes-deputy-Harman-plans-relax-abortion-laws.html\">denying anyone</a> a voice in next week's debate. It's being mooted that a procedural motion known as a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P10.pdf\">programme motion (pdf)</a> is set to be applied on Wednesday, that will severely limit discussion time on the HFE bill, and that will probably mean that none of the liberalising amendments can be taken. So we can forget about getting rid of the two-doctor rule that treats women as children and completely denies us agency over our own bodies; we can forget about allowing nurses more involvement in terminating unwanted pregnancies; we can forget about extending abortion access across the country by <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmbills/070/amend/pb0701206a.2669-2670.html\">allowing other healthcare providers</a> besides hospitals and abortion clinics to administer terminations; in fact we can forget about any of the moves to introduce a more progressive and woman-centred abortion law into the UK. From all accounts, if we're very lucky on Wednesday the status quo will remain. If we're unlucky, and Dorries and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/09/health.health\">religious fundamentalists</a> get their way, women's reproductive rights could be set back by decades.</p> <p>This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve the abortion law in this country, and Brown is about to blow it.</p> <p>Brown <a href=\"http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/content/view/288/106/\">needs to listen</a> to Diane Abbott, Dr Evan Harris, Jacqui Lait and all those who have campaigned so passionately on this issue, and he needs to listen to the 85 academic lawyers and ethicists who have called on him <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4958547.ece\">in the Times today</a> to scrap the qualifying conditions on abortion. If the government wants to see a reduction in the number of later term abortions, the only way they're going to achieve that is by making abortion services easier for women to access. This is what next week's amendments are trying to achieve, and why maintaining the status quo should not be an option.</p> <p>So, while it might be mildly entertaining to watch Dorries fail again in next Wednesday's debate, in the context of everything else that's going on with the HFE bill, the religious right's refusal to retire gracefully from the ring in the face of overwhelming opposition to their anti-woman agenda is really little more than a distraction. There are far more important debates than the one over the time limit to be had, and in the interests of fairness and democracy, MPs must insist that those debates be allowed to take place. Pro-choice MPs from all sides of the House held back from submitting their progressive amendments during the bill's second reading, in the interests of defending the existing abortion law, and in the face of the barrage of submissions from those who oppose women's reproductive rights. They knew they would get another opportunity to liberalise the law during the bill's later progress through parliament, but Brown seems determined to deny them that chance. This cannot be allowed to happen.</p>",
  "<p>Most of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/film+tone/reviews\">reviews</a> of the new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125688/brideshead.revisited\">Brideshead Revisited</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a> compared it unfavourably to the novel and the TV mini-series. The critics, all of whom we have to believe have read the book and/or seen the TV version, assumed that most audiences would be able to make the same comparison. However, whenever a classic novel or play is adapted for the big screen, the source work is always lurking like Banquo's ghost and there is no way an intertextual reading can be avoided.</p> <p>Adaptations from one medium to another are usually judged by their fidelity to the original source without taking into account the specificity of the art form. But the more \"faithful\" a film version is to the novel or play on which it is based, the more redundant it becomes, unless the form and content, not the spirit, are betrayed. That is perhaps why great screen versions of great works of literature are extremely rare.</p> <p>On the whole, the novel has been less intransigent to transposition than the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatre\">theatre</a>, mainly because the latter is narratively closer to film. Most film adaptations of plays fail to take into account the vast structural differences between a play and a screenplay. Therefore, no matter how much the director, often self-consciously, tries to \"open it out\", the theatrical framework is still discernible.</p> <p>Next month, inevitable comparisons will be made between stage and screen during an interesting season at the BFI of films based on the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tennesseewilliams\">Tennessee Williams</a>. Ironically, although he was one of the most filmed of playwrights, Williams was also among the most bowdlerized and censored. Because of the timidity and puritanism of Hollywood, there was always a tense relationship between Williams' plays and films. Hollywood adapted them despite fearing that the subject matter would be too provocative for middlebrow audiences.</p> <p>The recent death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paulnewman\">Paul Newman</a> has reminded us of his beauty and acting skills while in his 30s, notably his appearance in two Williams adaptations directed by Richard Brooks, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79091/cat.on.a.hot.tin.roof\">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a> (1958) and Sweet Bird of Youth (1962), both of which suffered from bowdlerization, betraying the source material in a superficial sense.</p> <p>Leaving aside aesthetic considerations, the textual modifications changed the slant of the plots to a substantial degree. Williams strongly denounced the movie version of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and even asked for his name to be removed from the credits because of the elimination of Brick's possible homosexual relationship with his football buddy Skipper. The playwright felt that repressed sexuality was a crucial element in the drama. In the play, Brick is drinking himself into oblivion as he longs for the dead love of his life, while denying the truth behind their bond. In the film, Newman's reluctance to bed the ravishing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/elizabethtaylor\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> is inexplicable, and the \"happy ending\" fails to convince when she mendaciously claims to be pregnant before he lures her to bed.</p> <p>Perhaps the most risible bowdlerization of Williams' work occurs in Sweet Bird of Youth. Newman, as a gigolo moving ineluctably towards his comeuppance, is seized by frat-boy thugs led by Rip Torn, who cries, \"We're just gonna take away loverboy's meal ticket\" and then breaks Newman's nose. Instead of the character being emasculated, the film was.</p> <p>Hollywood's Production Code demanded major revisions in Elia Kazan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78196/streetcar.named.desire\">A Streetcar Named Desire</a> (1951), such as toning down the language and eradicating any reference to Blanche DuBois's gay husband, while only hints of Blanche's nymphomania were allowed. A final scene was forcibly added to show Stella leaving her husband as punishment for Stanley's rape of her sister. One thing the censors couldn't control was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/marlonbrando\">Marlon Brando</a>'s raw sexuality. Nor the wonderfully witty and erotically-charged performances in Kazan's Baby Doll (1956), condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency because it \"dwells upon carnal suggestiveness\". </p> <p>In fact, despite many of the concessions made to pander to the \"moral majority\" in the US, and the disjunction between theatre and cinema, enough has been retained in the films of Williams' enduring theme, described by Arthur Miller as \"the romance of the lost yet sacred misfits, who exist in order to remind us of our trampled instincts, our forsaken tenderness, the holiness of the spirit of man.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today St George's Hill in Surrey boasts some fine stockbroker-belt residences and an exclusive golf course to accommodate idle hours. Here opulent private properties sit untouchable behind security gates and surveillance cameras. It was not always so. In 1649, as the civil war drew to a close and Charles I stepped out on to a Whitehall balcony to face the executioner, the landowners of St George's Hill were confronted by an influx of nightmare neighbours, the so-called Diggers.</p> <p>These Diggers brashly laid claim to the common land, arguing that if the title meant anything it meant communal agriculture, the tilling of the soil and the cultivation of crops by the people. Local gentry, vigorously abetted by the incumbent Presbyterian parson, called on General Fairfax's army to intervene in defence of their traditional grazing rights. The Diggers were intruders, trespassers, ploughing the commons and cutting down vast quantities of wood to erect their dwellings, to cook, and to fend off the cold. Their eloquent leader, Gerrard Winstanley, advanced their claims in the name of natural justice \u2013 an end to the hideous \"Norman yoke\", history's theft by force of the people's birthright \u2013 but also in the name of God.</p> <p>A band of discharged soldiers from the New Model Army, the hardcore Diggers of St George's Hill were arraigned before Kingston Court and fined beyond their means. Their huts were periodically levelled by local bailiffs, tradesmen and villagers jealous of their acres. In the end the Surrey Diggers were put down, scattered from their makeshift huts by winter weather and force of arms. Yet what these desperate upstarts achieved during 12 fraught months of sowing and praying has so inspired later generations that San Francisco radicals of the 1960s adopted the name. We possess a record of their songs, which uncannily anticipate Orwell's Beasts of England from Animal Farm: \"Though we have been sad/ Yet now we are glad/ To see such a joyful time/ Our Miseries they,/ Are passing away/ And truth begins to climb ...\"</p> <p>Our main window into the souls of the Diggers is the collected writings of the Lancashire-born tradesman's son, Winstanley, who had recently lost his business in London and earned his keep by grazing cattle near Walton. The Diggers were certainly communists, in some respects anarchists, and modern scholars continue to argue how much \"Marxism\" is to be found in Winstanley's credo, alongside the dominant religiosity of the Puritan revolution which temporarily turned Cromwell's England into a theocratic republic. Clearly Winstanley himself experienced semi-mystical trances, dreaming of the divine spark releasing the purging, cleansing fire from the bush. \"The whole of creation of fire, earth, air and water and all types of body created from them, this is the clothing of God, but in the days since Adam's fall, since Esau's triumph over the younger brother Jacob, the masters have taken a profit from the workers of the world, setting up parliaments to legalize their privileges, employing corrupt priests and parsons to sanctify the order of society.\" But in Isaiah it is written, \"The lion and the lamb shall feed together.\"</p> <p>I became acquainted with the Diggers in Oxford University tutorials with the great historian of our 17th-century upheavals, Christopher Hill, who at that juncture was severing his links with the Communist party in the wake of the Hungarian revolution. Out of this came a novel, Comrade Jacob, published in the spring of 1961. But how to climb into the heads of Fifth Monarchists, Quakers, Ranters and the other mushrooming sects? We find it easier, surely, to understand the strictly secular doctrines of Jacobins and Bolsheviks. I divided the storytelling between Winstanley's own self-righteous narrative and scenes in which his actions and personality are viewed through a more sceptical authorial lens. Much of it was mere conjecture - the evidence is hazy. But this haze, which became the oxygen of the novel, was later lost in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a> version.</p> <p>Some of my left-wing contemporaries embarking on careers in TV, the theatre and film took an immediate interest in Comrade Jacob. As it turned out they were little interested in the religious dimension of the story. If memory serves, an early TV adaptation, screened by the BBC drama department, somewhat resembled a civil war jousting society of Roundheads and Cavaliers firing muskets and clashing steel in Duke's Meadows. A few years after that my friend, the greatly gifted John McGrath, adapted the novel for the stage, as the opening production of the Gardner Arts Centre at the University of Sussex.</p> <p>The recurrent problem in these adaptations during the 1960s and 70s was the erosion of two central themes of the novel by the partisan passions of the New Left. Winstanley's mystical religious fervour went out of the window \u2013 he was always found on his feet rather than his knees. Also defenestrated was the rising personal power this opinionated prophet exercised among his poor followers, and how his \"moral parsonage\" may have entered his soul. In the stage and screen adaptations he was to be found striding out of a socialist realist manual, a clear-headed tribune of the people, a steadfast hero unburdened by the shadow of Esau. The lessons of Orwell's Animal Farm did not surface.</p> <p>By the time I was approached by two gifted young film-makers in the early 1970s, Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo, I was cautious enough to make it a condition of assigning the rights that I should write the film script myself. I didn't know that Kevin and Andrew had been beavering for some years to raise money for the project, and that various scripts (to be found in the BFI archive) had already been presented to potential producers. The BFI production board funded the enterprise, shooting went ahead near Hindhead, and I duly discovered that screenwriters do not count for much. Not until I was shown the final product did I realise what had been going on. I duly withdrew my screenwriting credit. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80993/winstanley\">Winstanley</a> is certainly a remarkable achievement which has earned itself film society and television screenings around the world for more than thirty years. It was shot on a shoestring budget (the BFI contributed \u00a317,000), the brilliant cameraman Ernest Vincze and all but one of the actors giving their services out of love. The film comes across as unflinchingly authentic in naturalistic terms, not unlike Brownlow's earlier fictional documentary about a Nazi occupation of Britain, It Happened Here. Brownlow and Mollo captured the surface detail of civil-war England \u2013 ploughs, weapons, uniforms - with the same devotion to detail, and the black-and-white camerawork is spellbinding. </p> <p>But here lies the problem: Winstanley is a vivid commentary on the physical condition of 17th century rural England, but it is reluctant to penetrate the intense religious motivations of the time. Winstanley believed that to know the secrets of nature is to know the works of God within the creation. This extends to the characters. I make no great claims for my novel in this regard but it did attempt to convey individuals' sometimes perverse changes of mood and motivation. This is certainly retained in the person of the army commander, Lord General Fairfax, but Winstanley, the eponymous hero of the film, remains from start to finish a decent, upstanding, strangely well-spoken Left Book Club idealist. The rough edges of a Lancastrian, the religious torment, the mood swings between pride and humility, Winstanley's mounting confusions about God and Reason, have utterly gone.</p> <p>The film does introduce one major coup nowhere to be found in the novel. By the early 1970s London was in the grip of a squatter crisis. They were occupying vacant premises (and not always so very vacant) across London, resorting to illicit stratagems to extract free electricity. Among the movement's more flamboyant leaders was the high-voiced Sid Rawls, who in the film is parachuted into the Digger camp with several fellow-Ranters: idle hippies shocking the worthy colonists by prancing naked and uttering a stream of blasphemies. This theatrical happening never took place but the episode works well dramatically, evoking the modern thrust of freewheeling druggies and exciting an enthusiastic response from London's squatters.</p> <p>Winstanley remains a remarkable film about the desperate claims of impoverished, landless English people \u2013 a heritage now buried beneath St George's Hill golf club. I remember Kevin showing me clips from the austere eye of Carl Dreyer, a fertile influence, and one also finds beguiling versions of Bergman's silhouetted figures trudging in pursuit of destiny across distant horizons. Wonderfully done, but now, as 30 years ago, my admiration remains somewhat rusted by regret. When the committed artist speaks to the present through the past, he must always stay in touch with what is awkward and strange, with what remains elusive in terms of the modern.</p> <p>\u2022 Winstanley is screened on October 17 and October 19 as part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a></p>",
  "<p>Lawyers are circling the carrion from the US financial crisis for a steady diet of lawsuits and litigation. Hundreds of lawsuits vying for \"class action\" status had been filed even before the latest downward spiral in the crisis.</p> <p>Leading the way is Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman &amp; Robbins (www.csgrr.com), the law firm that last month revealed it had squeezed $7.2bn (\u00a34.1bn) from Enron scoundrels \u2014 the highest recovery in a class action lawsuit in the US.</p> <p>Darren Robbins, a partner at the firm, said it was involved in dozens of lawsuits, despite turning away as many as 80% of the contacts received from large private and public funds. Issues of recoverability and jurisdiction dictate whether CSGRR becomes involved, he said.</p> <p>According to a recently released study by Navigant Consulting, there were 607 sub-prime related cases filed in US federal courts at the end of June \u2014 310 were filed in the first six months of 2008 \u2014 more than the 297 total cases filed during the whole of 2007. </p> <p>CSGRR is probably the first firm many would-be plaintiffs contact because last month it hit a home run in Enron litigation. It represented the lead plaintiff in the <a href=\"http://www.txs.uscourts.gov/notablecases/newby6028.pdf\">class action lawsuit against Enron</a> and its executives where $7.2b was recovered after Robbins said the initial assessment of recovery would be $500m. </p> <p>Robbins is undaunted by the task of tracking down the loot from bankrupt entities and scattered executives. Again in September it was announced he helped recover $30m from the former CEO of United Health, William McGuire, who was part of a stock option backdating scam.</p> <p>The firm has filed lawsuits against well-known companies such as AIG, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Citibank; against mortgage brokers; against foreign institutions; and against funds that \"packed clandestinely some of their most conservative investment vehicles with high risk mortgage-backed CDO (collateralised debt obligations) products\", said Robbins.</p> <p>Particularly egregious was what happened at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, he said. \"They artificially inflated their balance sheet by billions of dollars, which were used to justify hundreds of millions of dollars in payments to senior executives in the form of improper bonuses. They also falsified their income statements.\"</p> <p>Federal prosecutors have said they are now examining the books for 2007 at the two entities, neither of which is a stranger to trouble. Fannie Mae paid $400m to the SEC in 2006 to settle charges that senior staff used accounting gimmicks to hide $10.3bn in losses from 2002 to 2004 to maximise bonuses.</p> <p>Freddie Mac paid $125m in fines in 2003 after regulators charged that the company manipulated its accounts to push about $5bn in earnings to future quarter.</p> <p>Of the two companies, Robbins said: \"If you are willing to agree that the balance sheets of Fannie and Freddie were appropriately stated over the last nine months I've got an impressive bridge to sell you.\"</p> <p>Some legal observers speculated that the number of lawsuits would be curtailed by a US Supreme Court decision earlier this year. Stoneridge Inv Partners LLC v Scientific-Atlanta curtailed the ability of plaintiffs to sue peripheral players even though they had deep pockets. But Robbins said that would not be the base as the \"financial sphere\" was exempted in the decision.</p> <p>Just last week AIG auditors PriceWaterhouseCoopers agreed to pay $97.5m to settle investors' claims in class action litigation spearheaded by the <a href=\"http://www.ag.state.oh.us/press/08/10/pr081003.pdf\">Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS)</a>. </p> <p>The settlement is one of the 10 highest to be paid by an accounting firm to settle a securities fraud class action, and Chris Geidner, the state's principal assistant attorney general, said he believed the suit would have stood if it had been filed post-Stoneridge. \"Auditors are not 'non-speaking actors' and they have to issue opinion letters which are part of a company's SEC filings,\" he said.</p> <p>The suit now continues against AIG and its former CEO Hank Greenberg. Already 40m documents have been filed in discovery, said Geidner.<br></p>",
  "<p>One of the great claims about the internet has always been that it doesn't respect borders. John Perry Barlow, in his \"<a href=\"http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/Declaration-Final.html\">declaration of cyberspace independence</a>\" \u2013 written way back in 1996 \u2013 claimed that national governments couldn't hold sway against the determined electrons of cyberspace: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours,\" he wrote.</p> <p>And then we have a week like this, in which police forces acting for those boring nation-based governments shut down some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/spam-usa\">spammers allegedly responsible for generating one-third of all the world's spam</a>, and then a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/17/identity-fraud-darkmarket\">scammers' website where criminals traded stolen bank and card details</a>.</p> <p>Sounds like a bit of a win there for the nation state. Though to be fair, Barlow was writing a long time before the spammers and scammers had really discovered the net, and trying to make a point about free speech.</p> <p>What's also interesting is that the geeks' favoured solutions \u2013 technological ones \u2013 really didn't work. Bill Gates famously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/jan/25/billgates.spam\">pronounced that spam would be solved</a>, and put Microsoft's brightest (well, I hope they were the brightest: how would you feel if you were drafted into it, looked around and realised everyone else on the antispam team was an also-ran?) into coming up with ways to beat it through technical fixes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/aug/26/newmedia.it1\">such as SPF</a>.</p> <p>Didn't work. Spam kept growing.</p> <p>Antivirus companies have been selling people products to safeguard their machines against trojans, bots and so on for years. Hasn't stopped a dramatic number of machines being infected (though one has to accept that more would have been infected than without), and people's details stolen. There have been more than 60 arrests so far.</p> <p>I score that as 2-0 to solutions based on law rather than technology. True, the technological fixes are often quicker \u2013 but they don't discourage in the way that say, a jail sentence or even the process of having your assets, computers and possessions seized, frozen and inspected by the police will. And with the greater transparency being forced on banks all around the world, it becomes harder for the illicit gains to be stashed away.</p> <p>It has taken some while for the law to catch up. There was the way that the creator of the Love Bug virus (the first that really had a global impact) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/08/philippines\">got off scot-free</a> because there were no laws in the Philippines against writing viruses. The author of the Melissa virus (which preceded Love Bug) was <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/melissaSent.htm\">sentenced to 20 months in jail</a>. But it is common in a field that's rapidly developing that the law takes a while to pull on its shoes and socks. Driving under the influence of alcohol (as opposed to being completely drunk) hasn't been illegal forever; in England (I'm astonished to have discovered in the course of writing this piece) <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=drunk+driving+law+first+introduced+england+1967&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zuaGgdk26m&amp;sig=k4g6l7E3j67gI2asevLMtcy6rN4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result\">strict limits were only introduced in 1967</a>.</p> <p>But once you have laws in place, the game changes. That's the difference between technology and law. When you introduce a new technology \u2013 such as the internet \u2013 it creates huge, rippling effects on society as a whole. You can't predict them, and it's probably wiser not to try. But you can predict that criminals will try to exploit its downside, just as entrepreneurs will try to exploits its benefits.</p> <p>The wave washes over society, and then the ripples become smaller; we've integrated it into our lives. The internet hasn't finished overturning how we live, but it's a lot clearer what role it has. And that's where the law finally has a chance to catch up.</p> <p>Even so, governments have a way to go. The FBI in the US has done well, but in the UK the government hasn't shown enough signs that it's really au fait with what's going on. Richard Clayton, a security researcher at Cambridge University and one of the writers of the Light Blue Touchpaper blog, <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2008/10/02/epolicing-tomorrow-the-world/\">notes</a> that earlier this month the Home Office <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/new-specialist-ecrime-unit\">announced</a> there will be a <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/pceu/index.htm\">Police Central e-Crime unit (PCeU)</a>, which \u2013 once it's operating next spring \u2013 will be able to tackle crime that's not big enough for the Serious and Organised Crimes Agency (which helped in the arrest of the ID fraudsters' ring), yet not localised enough for local police.</p> <p>Clayton thinks there's still a way to go, and points to Bonnie and Clyde \u2013 whose 1930s' inter-state bank robberies created jurisdictional problems, until robbing banks was made a federal rather than state crime \u2013 as the classic pre-internet example. </p> <p>As Clayton notes, we do have modern Bonnie and Clydes, \"with criminals in one country fleecing consumers in another while using systems hosted in a third\".</p> <p>But he says the problem isn't being tackled properly. \"What isn't happening, or at least only in a handful of very specialised areas, is any international cooperation in setting priorities or selecting cases to pursue. Every country is doing its own thing about e-crime, and there's a widespread impression that any criminal who can operate from 'across the state line' is essentially immune from serious investigation.\"</p> <p>Well, that might have felt like it was true earlier this month. But maybe this week marks the beginning of a change in cooperative policing. It's about time, after all.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe it looked too delicious to resist or perhaps the hours of waiting had simply provoked the appetites of spectators beyond control.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, Iran's eccentric bid to set a world record for making the biggest-ever ostrich sandwich appeared to end in failure today after the evidence was eaten by the hungry watching crowds.</p> <p>Organisers were trying to enter the Guinness Book of World Records by producing a 1,500 metre-long sandwich containing 1,000kg of ostrich meat. More than 1,000 cooks laboured from early morning in Tehran's Mellat park to assemble the monster sandwich.</p> <p>But as soon as their task was completed, popular enthusiasm overwhelmed the need for attention to detail as crowds began devouring the snack before its measurements could be verified.</p> <p>Chaotic scenes ensued as the sandwich was rapidly gobbled up, leaving three Guinness representatives present bewildered and unsure if a new standard had been set.</p> <p>With a battery of local and international television crews on hand, organisers voiced the hope that video footage would be accepted as proof that the previous record of 1,378 metres, set in Italy in May this year, had been broken.</p> <p>\"We still think the sandwich will be recorded in the Guinness book because of all the evidence and footage that we will send them,\" Parvin Shariati, a spokesperson for the organisers, told Reuters.</p> <p>The event was organised jointly by Tehran municipality's women's committee along with industrial ostrich farmers and food and catering groups as part of the city's second international food and health festival.</p> <p>Besides setting records, the long-term goal was to create a new cultural appetite for ostrich, which is lower in fat and cholesterol than other meats traditionally popular in Iran. Today's overwhelming response may indicate that the promoters have succeeded more quickly in that aim than they dared hope.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/17/military-afghanistan\">appointment of General Sir David Richards</a> to be head of the army next summer will bring a breath of fresh air to the job and some new thinking. But don't expect him to sound the retreat for British forces from Kabul, Kandahar and Helmand.</p> <p>He has decided views on Afghanistan, as he commanded the international force, Isaf, there from 2006 to 2007, and he's definitely up for an early bath for UK plc in the region. He acknowledges comments by our man in Kabul, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/afghanistan.usforeignpolicy\">Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/06/afghanistan.military\">Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith</a> that the campaign cannot be won by \"kinetic means' (ie force and firepower) alone, but differs from them. </p> <p>He is supportive of the bid by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/23/usa.iraq\">General David Petraeus</a>, the new US strategic commander for both the Iraq and Afghan theatres, for a surge of some 30,000 extra troops for Afghanistan. Petraeus believes his surge of 35,000 extra troops helped reduce violence in large parts of Iraq. In particular, he wants to get some three extra US brigades into the sensitive regions near the Pakistan border. </p> <p>With all the reservations about trying to win by firepower alone, Richards believes a quick reinforcement could prove vital to success or failure of the entire international enterprise in Afghanistan. \"As Petraeus said in London recently 'a bit of extra kinetic power sure would be useful now' and I am bound to agree,\" he told friends recently. He is sure to heed the American request for more forces from Nato allies. It is likely that Britain could be sending a further 2,000-3,000 troops by the spring \u2013 two battle groups, or a small brigade. </p> <p>In his time David Richards has had his differences with his American colleagues and superiors, but by temperament and outlook he is ideally suited to work with the cerebral and charismatic David Petraeus. He has a rare combination of being able to talk to soldiers under his command and gain their trust. Unusually in the increasingly bitchy atmosphere of inter-service rivalry, he is liked and respected by colleagues from the other services. He is also an extraordinarily effective communicator to mixed audiences of civilians. \"He really makes people want to listen,\" a senior politician told me at the annual Anglo-Italian conference at Pontignano last year. \"He was the one speaker everyone wanted to hear.\"</p> <p>But don't expect any premature ejaculatory quotes about the condition of British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the way his predecessor and present head of the army Sir Richard Dannatt did within weeks of taking over the top job. Richards is too fly for that. He knows the media well from his time as commander in Sierra Leone, East Timor as well as in Kabul \u2013 all of which brought honours for gallantry and leadership. </p> <p>It is what he will do beyond Afghanistan which will be most significant. As head of the army, as in the present job as commander in chief, he will have little day-to-day running of strategy and tactics, though of course he has an input along with the other service chiefs. On Afghanistan he realises that the tempo of Taliban operations is ratcheting up. There are no closed seasons in the campaign as there were a century and a century and a half ago. The Taliban are better equipped and trained, they are brilliant at propaganda through any means including internet and the mobile phone, and they have a new and more nihilistic command.</p> <p>Much of this new command operates out of deep sanctuaries inside the Pakistan border. How to tackle this, against a background of worsening security and growing political fragility across Pakistan, is now the major issue for Petraeus and the commander in Kabul, General David McKiernan. Supply routes for the international forces from the port of Karachi to the transit of the Khyber are now under direct threat. The focus for international security is as much on Pakistan now as Afghanistan itself.</p> <p>This has been compounded by a new strategy by al-Qaida and its affiliates in northern Pakistan. According to a <a href=\"http://mondediplo.com/2008/10/08neotalibans\">detailed analysis by Syed Saleem Shahzad</a> in October's Le Monde Diplomatique, al-Qaida has switched groups of fighters and affiliate groups from Kashmir to fighting and disrupting Nato and Isaf in Afghanistan. He also suggests that a new crop of Turkish militants has been trained in the new camps in northern Pakistan and Baluchistan and many are being sent back to Turkey and on into Europe. </p> <p>Richards' task \u2013 and he could command both the army and later all three services as chief of the defence staff in succession to Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup in 2011 \u2013 is to shape the forces and the British security philosophy for the long, ragged, open-ended campaigns and counter-insurgency operations ahead. They will not be limited by time and place, either.</p> <p>There will be a major defence and security review very soon. Resources are tight, but no one is talking seriously about defence and security cuts given the current scenario of threats and requirements, piracy, nuclear proliferation, insurgency, terror, and humanitarian and disaster relief requirements. </p> <p>The US army is to expand by 60,000 and the marine corps by 25,000. The UK forces will have to expand too by about 15,000 to 20,000, as they are too small for all the current jobs in hand and those looming on the horizon, though the politicians refuse to admit this. The trick is to make them agile and adaptable \u2013 along the lines that the Australian forces are now evolving. To do this at a reasonable price, politicians and military chiefs need to abandon the high spending the vanity projects of procurement, such as the \"deep strike\" aircraft carriers. Richards appears to be the man to navigate the choppy waters ahead. \"He's the best of his entire generation\" according to Admiral Lord Boyce, a former chief of the defence staff who also knew how to speak to power.</p>",
  "<p>With the news that the EU has identified a <a href=\"http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article4958503.ece\">risk of hearing loss to anyone listening to in-ear music over a volume of 89db</a>, we must consider the way we consume music.</p> <p>Do you listen to music on the tube? Or walking down a crowded high street? Chances are that if you do, you're whacking the volume up on your MP3 player or mobile phone to levels above what is considered safe to compete with the background noise.</p> <p>Apparently, most MP3 players go up to 100db and can reach up to 120db if you have a pair of plug-in earphones. I listen to my iPod when I'm commuting, but after I've got on the tube and the doors hiss shut, I take my headphones off. There's no way I want to slam up the volume to a ludicrous level to compete with screeching brakes and whooshing rails \u2013 it's just not worth it.</p> <p>But I'm in a minority. I'm surrounded by others who seem more than happy to risk their hearing in the name of metal, hip-hop or a Russell Brand podcast.</p> <p>The difference between us is that I already have tinnitus. I got it over a decade ago, probably from one too many terrible gigs at the Barfly \u2013 I was an A&amp;R man you see. I know the risks associated with \u2013 to paraphrase <a href=\"http://kristenhavens.typepad.com/my_back_pages/images/2008/03/17/larry_david_photo.jpg\">Larry David</a> \u2013 treating your ears like an amusement park. So the alert from the ungainly-titled <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scher/04_scher_en.htm\">European Union Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks</a> on restricting the volume on portable MP3 players sounds sensible to me.</p> <p>Don't misunderstand me, I loathe the police state of Health and Safety in which now live, where it's difficult to do anything without a team of inspectors requiring certification. But in this case I do think that it's irresponsible when it's kids who will mainly suffer. I'm old enough and deaf enough to recognise the problem: allowing your kids to damage their hearing is like letting them buy cigarettes, or live almost entirely on crisps.</p> <p>The music industry isn't helping either. Each year, record companies compete by mastering albums louder \u2013 it's been christened the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/01/metallica.popandrock\">Loudness War</a>. There is now little light and shade in new records, where digital compression makes sure that even the verse booms like a chorus and every single hi-hat beat hisses like an aerosol can.</p> <p>Add to that the fact that we're listening to these new releases on compressed and often distorted MP3s, then throw in some earphones and you've got a whole new meaning to Def Jam. So what do you think \u2013 should we retain the right to deafen ourselves? </p>",

Inspired by - and created for 'electro-pop artist RiK' - the game gets you intimate with the song and the musician so you've got no other option but to buy it. Nice piece of marketing, that. </p> <p>Keep reading for the details, and find out what other games he's got on his plate (that's a reference, that is).<br></p> <p><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words</strong><br>It's a music game with a new twist. The animated electro-pop artist RiK has launched a new single called Essex Girl, and simultaneously launched this game as a 'game single' to promote it at http://www.rikworld.com. You can control RiK on the bass guitar, and direct the lights and camera of his live performance. The better you learn the tune and the more accurately you play, the higher your score.  <strong>How do players control the game?</strong><br>Players use they keyboard, mapped to represent an ascending scale on the guitar, so you really are playing a version of the tune note by note and testing your musical ability. Additionally, you can gain bonus points by triggering lights and camera moves with the keys.</p> <p><strong>What is your background?</strong><br>I set up <a href=\"http://www.stateofplaygames.com\">State of Play</a> this year to start making bigger games. As a freelance games designer I've been making games for around five years, usually taking on all the design and programming work myself, when I'd really like just to be designing and animating. The games have become very popular and gone on to win awards at festivals like SXSW, and the time came when, to continue to create ambitious titles, the business needed to grow. State of Play was born, and we've now got full-time programmers and a producer. In the casual gaming world you don't need a big team, and we're smaller than most, but that makes us more flexible.<br> <strong>Name your competitors.</strong><br>We don't really see it as 'us versus them', the plan is just to create innovative titles each time. It's not like trying to sell a new brand of washing powder to jaded masses, and that's a very good thing. It's about creating new game experiences which will draw in existing casual gamers, and grab new audiences along the way.  <strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong><br>Our games have been featured as the Number 1 game on Miniclip.com, which has over 43 million unique visitors per month, so it's fair to say we've had millions of players. The target in twelve months is to make numbers like that come directly to our sites, rather than through one portal, which will give us more revenue and a greater control over where we take our business. <strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>Almost everything feels like a challenge when you place high an importance on innovation, and the most stressful things are often short term problems like code fixing, when you just desperately want to see your concepts working, although after much wailing and gnashing of teeth these things are always ironed out. In a broader sense, the biggest challenge will be to keep this sense of innovation whilst building the business, but the best thing with the relatively low cost of creating casual games is that innovation can be economically viable. And the online gaming audience positively demand innovation, so that helps. <strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far?</strong><br>I created a Baseball game for Miniclip last year, and I needed reference to draw all the player animations. 3D motion capture is reserved for the kinds of budgets only the big console developers can afford, so I found myself, in January in the middle of Kent, dressed in full Detroit Tigers baseball kit, leaping around a field infront of a video camera in the drizzle, freezing my baseballs off. When I thought about how it would eventually look like I was in a beautfully sunny field in the USA, that seemed pretty weird.  <strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong><br>The RiK game is distributed effectively for free on flash portals like Newgrounds and Hallpass, and the cost of hosting is borne by advertising partners like Gamejacket, and this method has already generated thousands of hits worldwide. RiK's presence on Facebook, Bebo, YouTube and MySpace is part of an integrated campaign, where the music promotes the game and vice verca, and the RiK community grows. Our upcoming project, <a href=\"http://www.basebods.com\">Basebods</a>, is building up a fanbase before launch with a similarly integrated presence on the web. The plan is that the games will all become something much larger than before - they'll have their own communities built around them.<br> <strong>Are indie games the latest killer app?</strong><br>Oh yes. The power is shifting from the big players in the console market to those making online games. Eventually, the amount of money spent on online casual gaming might creep up to that spent on console games, in which case companies will be tackling those challenges associated with large development teams. For now though, the freedom we have is kickstarting a lot of interesting experimentation. <strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong><br>Yes, we think so. The RiK game and Basebods will have millions of players soon, and the communities around them are flourishing. We also have lots of exciting ideas lined up in the new year, and can't wait to get started. Onward!</p>",
  "<p>Dealing with one's parents' troglodyte political views can be an exasperating business. But this campaign, perhaps because of its endlessness or because of its increasingly high stakes \u2014 the economy <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/business/16markets.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">melting down</a> or the prospect of Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrzXLYA_e6E\">a heart beat away</a> from the presidency \u2014 may have made many families more than ordinarily testy about the race. </p> <p>\"I get enough spam as it is, without having to weed through additional emails from family members to determine whether or not they are worth my time. The jokes and cute kittens emails are OK, but please discontinue the forwarding of political and religious emails,\" my brother wrote my mother earlier this year, precipitating several rounds of back-and-forth recrimination in our family.</p> <p>To me, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgHHX9R4Qtk\">Sarah Silverman's comical notion</a> of <a href=\"http://www.thegreatschlep.com/site/index.html\">convincing Jewish relatives in Florida to vote for Barack Obama</a> through familial threats and intimidation, hints at a darker problem: what if yours won't come around? What if you find yourself having to decide: my politics or my family? And having to conclude that these people who I've mostly cherished are cretins?</p> <p>My mom, for instance, likes Palin much more than she likes me. Palin turns out, in fact, to be my mom's soulmate. She's dreamy over her: \"She's fresh like a daisy.\" She's an articulation of my mom's dreams and ambitions: \"I see her as a role model for my daughters.\" </p> <p>My mother is a Republican-committee-woman type who recently moved from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckhead_(Atlanta)\">Buckhead in Atlanta</a> to a gated community called Big Canoe an hour from the city in the north Georgia mountains. If she had political opinions beyond some traditional Republican bromides as well as the irksome articles and emails she forwards, I'd long ago become inured to them. To me it was just mom-ish background noise. Whatever my mother's politics, we comported ourselves like any more or less liberal (certainly for the south we were liberal), upwardly mobile family \u2014 an emphasis on culture betterment, Ivy League schools and, ultimately, an apartment for me in the East Village in Manhattan.</p> <p>I never suspected this might not be what my mother wanted for her daughter. But Palin seems now to suggest on her part some sort of reverse snobbery \u2014 an attack on the way I was raised by the woman who raised me. Maybe that was the point: her over identification with Palin is a way to punish her children for not taking her politics seriously (or for not even listening). Which, indeed, was suddenly another sore point: my mother is truly taken with Palin's horrifying family.</p> <p>\"If I had gotten pregnant at 17,\" I demanded, \"would you have made me get married?\" </p> <p>\"We don't know that Sarah Palin made her daughter get married. Though I am glad if she did.\" </p> <p>\"Huh? Hello? You were a member of <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\">Planned Parenthood</a>!\"</p> <p>Be calm. I tried the patient daughter approach (or the impatient daughter trying to act patiently): \"OK Mother, but on the issue of Palin's intelligence and experience ... .\"</p> <p>\"Sweetheart, I would like you to get past taste,\" said my mom in what seemed suddenly to me like the eerily placid voice of a cult member, \"and judge people for what they stand for and how they feel about things. Reject Palin for her views, but not who she is.\"</p> <p>We broke down shortly. \"Mother, the decision you have to make is between Sarah Palin and me \u2014 you can't have it both ways. You can't love her and love me. We negate each other. The point of my life is not to be Sarah Palin.\"</p> <p>Fury. Apoplexy. Embarrassment. Still, my family.</p> <p>\"Is your mother a complete moron?\" Asked my New York boyfriend as a I tried to describe my frustrating and confounding conversations. Family pride briefly won out over political sense, rousing me suddenly to attack the boyfriend and defend my moronic mother. </p> <p>A few weeks after Palin's nomination, I was forwarded an article about why New York-sort of people necessarily oppose Palin (which I forwarded to my mother \u2014 why not?). This condescending view spurred another effort on my part of trying to see this as an issue of the elites in places like New York versus my salt-of-the-earth parents in their gated community. </p> <p>Families exist, after all, in complicated contexts. If my life had become different from my parent's life, that did not mean that we had to turn on each other, that we could not somehow understand each other. Right? </p> <p>Nuts. That's the thing with Palin. There just isn't any real way to rationalise her \u2014 or to think well of the people who might, or even to quite comprehend the people who might. The fact of her sudden existence is crazy. If the rise of George Bush toyed with good sense, Palin stomps it. She's beyond logic. She may be as bizarre and loopy a political development as any in our time. It's all the more bizarre for the fact that vast numbers of people get the joke \u2014 it's there in primetime. Palin is the national joke. She can't be taken seriously \u2014 and she isn't. She defines the purest, most stubborn, most brazen, knuckledheadness in America. And even more infuriatingly, it's an empowering knuckledheadness (which is exactly the problem with knuckleheadedness). </p> <p>\"I believe,\" said my mom in one of our recent conversations, growing testier by the moment, her in the flush of her Sarah excitement, \"I should be president\".</p> <p>\"You? Mother, you?\"</p> <p>\"I have as good a brain as any up there,\" said my mom. \"Our nation was not founded by professional politicians.\"</p> <p>Calm down, breathe regularly. There was, possibly, some good news here. My mother seemed to be disregarding the relative awe with which she has always held Republicans in Congress. Palin might be a kind of acknowledgement of how badly the Bush years had turned out. Palin is, after all, a kind of rejection of politicians \u2014 that's what her having, practically speaking, no experience in government was about. Anyone can do it better than it has been done. You can't expect diehard Republicans to admit their own failure and obsolescence. So a Palin figure is just the agent of this understanding. She's hyperbole. Insisting on this ridiculous figure could be my mom's way of helping the Bush years end. Maybe. </p> <p>But then there is another sort of conclusion. Our own politics emerge from our families during stubborn, implacable, contrary conversations. In a family debate there is no hope for a fitting riposte, no standard of logical argument, no need of a factual basis. Just an absolute determination to insist, to not give in, to fight to the bitter end. Win or lose. The craziness here is deep. That's what explains Sarah Palin: my mom must be angry with me.</p>",

For decades he has been one of the world's most famous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/programming\">computer programmers</a> and holds a position as a research affiliate at the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology. </p> <p>As founder of the free <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/software\">software</a> movement in the 1980s, Stallman has been the inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/hacking\">computer hackers</a> around the world, and these days the 55-year-old spends his time travelling the globe and speaking about his work.</p> <p>But despite this hi-tech pedigree, he is one of a number of people who chooses to restrict his use of popular technologies in a way that may seem contrary. </p> <p>As a privacy campaigner, for example, he refuses to carry a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/mobilephones\">mobile phone</a>. And even though most of his work takes place on a computer, Stallman only sporadically connects to the internet and purposely avoids surfing the web. </p> <p>\"Very often I'm on planes or buses, or in a place where there's no internet, so I couldn't possibly do my work if I couldn't do it offline,\" he told the Guardian from his office in Boston. \"Fortunately I have a powerful computer, and it's capable of doing an awful lot without a web connection \u2013 something which many users don't seem to know about any more.\"</p> <h2>'I don't do e-commerce'</h2> <p>Stallman said that he might surf the web \"if I'm visiting somebody's house\", but says he refuses to indulge himself too much. \"I don't identify myself, and I don't do e-commerce,\" he added.</p> <p>Stallman's approach is partly philosophical and partly about keeping on top of things. He only checks his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/email\">email</a> after answering the existing messages, for example. In this he is not alone. Most of us know the feeling of dread when our computer pings and announces the arrival of yet another email, and research from the University of Glasgow has shown that 34% of us feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they receive.</p> <p>People working in the computer industry are often among those most affected by the weight of modern communications, since they frequently adopt the newest systems to help them stay always-on and constantly connected. </p> <p>However, despite the lure of email, blogs and the internet, some of the most accomplished technologists react by choosing to severely limit their interaction with the hi-tech world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll\">Clifford Stoll, an astronomer who helped catch Soviet computer hackers in the 1980s,</a> was an early internet sceptic and now campaigns against the introduction of computers in schools. Stoll rarely uses the net, although he retains a website where he sells homemade glass bottles. </p> <p>In the most extreme cases, technologists can become so disenchanted with the touted benefits of new systems that they end up disconnecting almost entirely. </p> <h2>Life without email</h2> <p>Retired professor Donald Knuth, like many 70-year-olds, doesn't use email, but his lack of involvement was the result of a conscious decision made nearly 20 years ago. The computer scientist, who lives in a house on the campus of California's Stanford University \u2013 the institution that has spawned giant technology corporations including Google, Hewlett Packard and Yahoo \u2013 says he simply doesn't want to waste his time.</p> <p>The hours he saves from not indulging in constant communication allow him to carry on work on his most famous book, The Art of Computer Programming \u2013 which has so far taken nearly 40 years to write, and he's only reached volume four of seven.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html\">Email is a wonderful thing for those people whose role in life is to be on top of things,\" Knuth says on the university's website.</a> \"But not for me: my role is to be on the bottom of things.\"</p> <p>The handful of high-technologists who have retreated from digital life are part of what Kevin Kelly, a founding editor of Wired magazine, has labelled the \"Neo-Amish\". Rather than succumb to hi-tech temptations, these highly competent engineers and programmers are choosing to drop out of the always-connected culture in favour of a better quality of life. </p> <p>\"Lots of people complain about being overloaded with email, blogs, Twitter, and so on,\" he wrote on his website earlier this year. \"But very few who complain reach the ultimate logical solution: turn it all off.\"</p> <p>Such solutions may appear drastic, but the problem of information overload is remarkably common, according to Mark Hurst, author of Bit Literacy, a guide to keeping your digital life under control. He believes that many people are crushed by the amount of communication they receive, even if they won't admit it.</p> <p>\"People are carrying enormous amounts of stress and anxiety over this, and most people don't even understand how much it affects them,\" he said. \"Untamed, this problem achieves gigantic proportions in their lives.\"</p> <h2>Technology worship</h2> <p>Stallman believes the problem is that too many are in thrall to the promises made by new developments. \"It's almost as if they worship technology and they don't care about the social consequences of using it,\" he said.</p> <p>However, Hurst says that unlike Knuth, who has an assistant who brings him a new batch of messages every three months, or Stallman, who has the luxury of running his own organisation, not everybody is in a sufficiently privileged position to give up entirely.</p> <p>\"There are people on the extremes who can afford to do that. If you're extremely rich you can have an assistant, or if you live off the grid somewhere you might have little need for these technologies,\" he said. \"But the vast majority of people have responsibilities that require them to be connected.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>On 27 July 2010 following a complaint from Barry George we would like to make it clear that Barry George was never prosecuted in connection with the allegations made in this article and he tells us that he was never interviewed by the police in connection with the allegations. We accept his assurance that he was not obsessed with Kay Burley.</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>The TV news presenter Kay Burley has gone to police with concerns about the self-confessed stalker who was cleared of murdering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/jilldando\">Jill Dando</a>, sources said today. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bskyb\">Sky News</a> anchorwoman contacted the Metropolitan police this week over fears that Barry George was taking too much interest in her. </p> <p>George visited the Sky News headquarters in west London last month to ask for a tape of Burley's interview with him after his acquittal in August. It was reported this week that he has downloaded pictures of the presenter to a laptop and smuggled the computer into the hostel where he has lived since August. </p> <p>Burley is off work after falling ill while presenting Afternoon Live With Kay Burley on Wednesday. </p> <p>George walked free from the Old Bailey on August 1 after a retrial cleared him of Dando's murder eight years after he was jailed for the crime. </p> <p>The second trial heard that he admitted following, approaching and photographing women. During three weeks of police surveillance before his arrest, George was seen to go up to 38 women and attempting to make conversation with them. Hundreds of photos of women, including other television personalities, were found at his home. </p> <p>In an interview after his acquittal, George said he could not have killed Dando because he was following another woman at the time of the shooting in April 1999. He said of his history of stalking: \"I know I have done wrong in the past and if I could go back in time and change that I would.\" </p> <p>It is understood Burley was not at work when George visited the Sky News studios last month, and he was turned away at the gatehouse. </p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm we have received an allegation from a woman. We are not prepared to discuss the location or details of the complaint and inquiries continue.\" </p> <p>Sky News declined to comment. Many Sky News staff will attend the funeral today of the channel's former presenter Bob Friend. It is not known whether Burley will be among them.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/16/greenpolitics-edmiliband\">statement by the new secretary of state for energy and climate change, Ed Miliband</a>, making Britain's emissions reduction target even more ambitious took many by surprise. We have now pledged to reduce our emissions not by 60% but by 80% by 2050, a massive cut from 1990 levels.<br><br>On a day where other European countries were seeking to lower their own carbon reduction targets and the world remained focused on economic volatility, Miliband's statement was bold and welcome. </p> <p>Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice. It fails to recognise that climate change and our carbon reliance is part of problem \u2013 high fuel prices and food shortages due to poor crop yields compound today's financial difficulties. And probably the biggest threat to our future economy is climate change and energy insecurity. </p> <p>What's more, setting and enshrining in law such green ambitions, along with creating a policy framework around them, will help to create jobs, trade and industries of the future.</p> <p>In the industrial revolution Britain led the world in advances that enabled mass production: trade exchanges, transportation, factory technology and new skills needed for the new industrialised world. With the right kind of investment, incentives and stimulus there's no reason we can't once again lead the world in advancements to enable the low-carbon revolution that is necessary to come into being.</p> <p>We have a strong and growing science base. We have now created a planning framework that enables faster growth in renewable energies. We are providing incentives for household and business energy saving. But we must do more. </p> <p>It's not a matter of if economies around the world becoming low-carbon, but when and how: through struggle and strife or through advancement and progressive leadership. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/17/globaleconomy-banking\">Larry Elliot described it today as the \"Green New Deal\"</a>. It's a leadership we in Britain can provide, and from which our economy can benefit.</p> <p>A global deal will only be possible if Britain plays its part, leading the way with other developed countries. </p> <p>Based on both the timing and the content of Miliband's first statement as the new climate change secretary, I am confident that we have the bold and challenging leadership we need.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's your favourite piece of technology?</strong><br>I love my iPhone, but I'm sure you've already had that though. I always used to have a cell phone AND an iPod, now I have it all in one. I just like to carry one device. I even have books on there. I have Eckhart Tolle on there reading The Power of Now and any time I need to fall asleep I listen to his very odd, soothing German voice talking about living in the moment and it just knocks me out. And I've got the calendar and I can synch it up \u2013 I'm a huge Mac fan. But I also love Xbox. Call of Duty 4, online, is a lot of fun because you can go online and shoot people. You can get all of your aggression out at the end of a long day. There's nothing more relaxing to me than shooting people in the side of the face. </p> <p><strong>How has it improved your life?</strong><br>If you turn it on, you get really adrenalised but it's also very relaxing at the same time. I have a three-and-half-year old son and he doesn't even know it exists. He found my Xbox controller and asked what it was, so I told him it was the controls to a spaceship. So for several days he walked around in a pretend spaceship with my Xbox controller. He even took it to pre-school for show and tell. But a lot of actors get online with each other and team up and shoot other people. </p> <p><strong>When was the last time you used it, and what for?</strong><br>I last used it when I was last at home and I used it for achieving harmony and inner peace. </p> <p><strong>What additional features would you add if you could?</strong><br>I think it should be like a Wii, so you could run around in your TV room and aim the controller like a gun and shoot people. Although that's getting awfully violent. That might inspire kids to take guns into their high schools and colleges and cause far too much mayhem on the planet, so cancel that. </p> <p><strong>Do you think it will be obsolete in 10 years' time?</strong><br>I think in 10 years' time there will be gaming devices surgically implanted in your cerebral cortex and just any time you want you'll be able to turn it on with a single thought and go online in your head, battling imaginary demons and monsters and soldiers of fortune. </p> <p><strong>What one tip would you give to non-Xbox users? </strong><br>Get a life.</p> <p><strong>Do you consider yourself to be a luddite or a nerd?</strong><br>I think I'm a combination. I love a lot of geeky technology but I'm not a total techno-nerd, it doesn't come easily to me and I have to get other people to teach me how to use it. But I look very convincing when using a gadget, I look like I should know what makes it tick but I need a lot of coaching. We need more geek coaches. You get personal trainers, why not a geek that shows up and teaches you how to be more geeky. </p> <p><strong>What's the most expensive piece of technology you've ever owned?</strong><br>I don't own that much expensive technology. I bought a big flatscreen TV for my Xbox, I think that was $3,500. That would probably be it. </p> <p><strong>PC or Mac? </strong><br>Mac all the way. Once you've had a Mac you can never go back.

  "<p>He came to call it \"the day of days\". Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Tootal, commander of the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, lost three of his men and personally zipped up and carried the body bag containing one of his dead soldiers from a helicopter as it landed in Camp Bastion in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a>.</p> <p>That man was Corporal Mark Wright, a 27-year-old from Edinburgh, who was posthumously awarded a George Cross for bravery to mark his actions on that terrifying day on September 6 2006. In the hours leading up to his death, three of the soldiers beside him were to lose a limb.</p> <p>A mortar fire controller with 3 Para mortar platoon, Wright was operating in the Kajaki Dam area when it came over the radio that a fellow para had been injured after treading on a landmine less than a mile from his location. </p> <p>While on patrol, Lance Corporal Stuart Hale had jumped over what he thought was a dry riverbed when he heard an explosion. As he looked down through a dusty maelstrom, Hale realised he was missing a finger and part of his leg.<br> Wright and eight other men, including medics and stretcher bearers, set off in the direction of the explosion. A path had been cleared to Hale, and he was given morphine. A tourniquet was applied to what remained of his leg. </p> <p>The party then began prodding the arid, rock-strewn ground for landmines so they could plot out a helicopter landing strip for a casualty evacuation. </p> <p>Back at Camp Bastion, Tootal's screams for a Black Hawk rescue helicopter were lost in Nato bureaucracy. He had a choice, wait 12 hours until engineers could clear the area of any potentially fatal ordnance and have his soldier bleed to death, or send in a Chinook that risked landing on a mine \u2013 he picked the latter.</p> <p>There was no winch equipment on board the helicopter and the crew faced a perilous task.<br> Stepping back across the cleared path Sergeant Stuart Pearson stumbled and set off another landmine. Within seconds it became clear to everyone that any move could be their last \u2013 they were stranded in the middle of a minefield. </p> <p>No one could help Pearson, so he had to apply his own tourniquet and stab an ampoule of morphine into himself.</p> <p>Over the shouting of orders, the whirring thump of a Chinook's rotor blades could be heard. Landing precariously on its two back wheels, the crew motioned to the paras to cross the cleared path to the helicopter.</p> <p>But the terrified soldiers were signalling to them to take off \u2013 they knew the downdraft from the blades could set off more mines. As the paras crouched to the ground, there was another blast. Fragments flew everywhere, hitting Wright in the chest, face, arms and neck.</p> <p>A medic who was next to him was also hit in the chest. In spite of his injuries, Wright continued to give first aid to those around him.</p> <p>In his testimony to the inquest, Tootal said: \"Perhaps something could have been moved by the helicopter, perhaps the helicopter taking off could have caused Mark Wright to move or move a bit of equipment. I think there is definitely a causal link to the helicopter and the detonation. That is implying no fault on the helicopter crew \u2013 they were doing their best.\" </p> <p>With seriously injured soldiers lying everywhere, a medic, Corporal Paul Hartley started throwing his medical rucksack into the minefield so that it would detonate any mines it landed on.</p> <p>He then jumped onto the cleared spot on which the bag had landed so that he could get to the injured. As he reached Wright, one of the soldiers standing close by him, Fusilier Andy Barlow, stepped back a few inches to make room. He too lost a leg. </p> <p>Back at headquarters, a furious Tootal \u2013 who had been following what was happening to his men on the radio \u2013 finally had his request for Black Hawk helicopters granted, three hours after the first landmine had exploded. No longer in the army, the former commander said he believed red tape and delays cost one of his men his life and others their limbs.</p> <p>On the ground, the men stayed as still as they could, stemming the blood from their wounds and trying to stay conscious by talking about girlfriends and family at home. After what seemed like an interminable wait, the Black Hawks arrived and with a winch began hoisting up the injured and the rest of the party.</p> <p>Although he was conscious for some of the journey, Wright succumbed to his injuries and died before reaching the field hospital. </p> <p>His citation for the GC read: \"Despite this horrific situation and the serious injuries he had himself sustained, Cpl Wright continued to command and control the incident. He remained conscious for the majority of the time, continually shouting encouragement to those around, maintaining morale and calm amongst the many wounded men.\"</p> <p>When survivors of that day gave evidence to the inquest, they were told by Andrew Walker, the deputy Oxford coroner: \"You are courageous and utterly fearless. I have nothing but admiration for you and your fellow soldiers.\"</p> <p>The Kajaki landmine trap was just the first of three major incidents on that day of days. In total, three of Tootal's men died, 18 soldiers were injured, with three of those losing their limbs.</p>",
  "<p>Is David Cameron at liberty to attack Gordon Brown's economic record as chancellor and prime minister? Of course he is. That's what we pay an opposition for: to oppose. He also produced a joke I hadn't heard.</p> <p>Yet to hear some of this morning's talk about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/davidcameron-politicalnews\">breaking the \"political truce\" during a financial crisis</a>, you'd think he'd done something terrible like push the Brown kids off their tricycles and grazed their tiny knees.<br><br>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/17/davidcameron-economy\">Tory leader's breakfast speech</a> at the all-singing-all-dancing high-tech Bloomberg News HQ in London (politicians seem to love all those flashing lights and glass) is actually rather a good one in its overall analysis. It's been a tricky week, what with having to support Saviour Brown's rescue plan, now being franchised everywhere. Today Dave's getting back into the game.</p> <p>We could pick holes in it - as I intend to in a moment. But its condemnation of Britain as a case of \"irresponsible capitalism presided over by an irresponsible government\" is as likely to upset rightwing Tory activists and the Daily Telegraph as it will the Brown bunker. </p> <p>Its tone is pragmatic \u2013 almost New Labour. Dave's complaint is that Blair and Brown abandoned socialism and fell for capitalism as a magical little black box. Free markets are essential, but never enough: they need to be regulated by people who know stuff, he explains.</p> <p>Cameron exaggerates, of course, when he writes off Brown's decade at No 11 as a \"complete and utter failure\". It's much more complicated than that. I lunched this week with the Engineering Employers' Federation where they were sombre about the economy, but basically in good fettle.</p> <p>\"In contrast to the popular image of decline, UK manufacturing has restructured itself in recent years and is now an increasingly high-value, high-skill sector of the economy\" with two-thirds of its output exported, says EEF publicity. </p> <p>Its officials have a direct line into government policy on everything from skills to taxes \u2013 and would do if Cameron and George Osborne were in charge. Osborne was a recent guest, they tell me, and impressed them more than some listeners expected. But they also respect Brown as a serious and clever man.</p> <p>But Cameron is surely right to complain that the financial boom \u2013 fuelled by cheap Asian goods and floods of Asian savings \u2013 led to gross irresponsibility in the west's financial services industries, on which governments should have called time. </p> <p>As a result Britons and their government went on an unsustainable spending spree. Hence Dave's joke, that the Consumer Price Index introduced by Brown - unlike the old RPI it does not include housing costs \u2013 is known as the \"China Price Index\". China's modernisation allowed it all to happen.</p> <p>True enough, but all governments colluded with the bubble in varying degrees. If Cameron thinks Brown was a socialist big spender who \"didn't fix the roof when the sun was shining\" he should check out that rightwing politician George W Bush \u2013 whose debt legacy will be even worse than Reagan and Bush Sr bequeathed to Bill Clinton. </p> <p>We could note in passing, incidentally, that then-chancellor Ken Clarke spent the 1997 election campaign denying our taunts - I did a bit of taunting myself - that he had dangerously ducked putting up interest rates for election purposes and that whoever won would have to put them up right away. Which is what happened.</p> <p>My second complaint? That he claims the left is saying that capitalism has failed and that state intervention is the permanent answer. Well, no, Jon McDonnell may say that, decent man that he is, but the real answer is more nuanced. Better regulation, if you prefer. Check out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/17/marketturmoil-banking\">the interview Adair Turner, the technocratic new chairman of the FSA, did with my colleague Larry Elliott</a> today.</p> <p>Turner, incidentally, makes the point that if the FSA had demanded more and better paid staff with which to set about party pooping the bubble before it burst the City would have complained that interference was ruining its global edge. Alan Greenspan's memoirs made the same complaint. Remember the Bears Sterns banker who said he \"had to keep partying until the music stops\"? He's flipping burgers now.</p> <p>In the more puritan times now open to us state intervention will have more legitimacy. I'm sure Cameron understands that; he's a smart man. He'll sanction plenty himself if he wins big in 2010, as his speech today confirms.</p> <p>But he's storing up trouble in today's speech by again talking about tax cuts (freezing council tax for instance) and shrinking the public sector, not least by tackling our old friend, waste.</p> <p>That's fine, but it's not going to be what the next few years are about. Ireland this week whacked up taxes to pay for the financial crisis now upon it and Ireland is arguably in better macroeconomic shape than we are. No wonder the Telegraph's urban guerilla columnists (no longer the urbane kind) get cross with Dave 'n' George for being so - Dave's word - \"responsible\".</p> <p>We'll see. Cameron's team has devised all sorts of mechanisms to guard against government wickedness (his own, presumably?) like the independent monitor of government spending and - a new one today? - a \"debt responsibility mechanism\" which will require the Bank of England to lean on the FSA if it's worried about lending, forcing it to raise capital requirement of errant banks.</p> <p>There's a passage in this morning's speech which we should all cut out and paste to our shaving mirrors - yes, even you ladies.</p> <blockquote> <p>That means discipline in opposition. No spending commitments which will never be delivered. No promises of upfront, unfunded tax cuts which will never happen. Instead, responsibly focusing on what can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be done. And it means discipline in government. Saying \"no\" more than \"yes\". Not borrowing to try and buy yourself a byelection. Living within your means.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We should judge shadow cabinet speeches by this yardstick as well as the cabinet's because the word didn't seem to have reached the Tory conference in Brum, which was awash with pledges, wholesome and otherwise.</p> <p>Yet for me the most interesting omission from Cameron's speech is any indication that we as individual citizens are in any way to blame for the crisis. Yes, the banks behaved badly, the government went along with things it should not have tolerated, the financial regulator dozed while teenage drivers tore off their City L-plates.</p> <p>But no one forced us to do daft things like take out 125% mortgages, use the old homestead as an ATM machine, flip buy-to-lets like the aforementioned burger or max six credit cards.

  "<p>The hundreds of visitors descending on the Baby Show at Earl's Court today are there to check out buggies, prams, babygros and maternity clothes. <br>But behind the scenes a row has broken out over the organisers' links to the defence industry, leading to the sponsors Bounty withdrawing their stand at the exhibition. </p> <p>Unicef has also stopped accepting donations from ticket sales because the exhibition's owner Clarion Events also runs controversial arms trade fairs. <br>Clarion, which will also be running the Spirit of Christmas show next month, picked up the DSEi, ITEC and LAAD defence shows from the publishing company Reed Elsevier earlier this year. </p> <p>Then in September it added the submarine exhibitions UDT Europe and UDT Asia Pacific to its portfolio. </p> <p>DSEi \u2013 Defence Systems and Equipment International \u2013 is an exhibition held every two years in London for the defence industry and last year attracted 26,500 visitors and 1,352 exhibitors from 40 countries. </p> <p>Clarion's brochure for the next show \u2013 to be held in September next year \u2013 boasts that the east London venue ExCeL allows \"warships to berth alongside the exhibition halls\". </p> <p>The Campaign Against the Arms Trade wrote to Baby Show exhibitors to inform them of Clarion's defence shows, prompting letters from Clarion reassuring them that their exhibitions served the \"legitimate global defence industry\". </p> <p>\"Congratulations to those companies and customers who have stood up and said that the owners of the Baby Show should not be running arms fairs,\" said a CAAT spokesman. \"Clarion is out of touch with public opinion. They can restore their reputation only by ending their involvement in the arms trade.\"<br> Clarion chief executive Simon Kimble said: \"Our ethics are important to us and we serve only the legitimate defence and security industry. Exhibitors and visitors must adhere to the highest regulatory scrutiny. We insist they not just comply with, but exceed, UK and international law.</p> <p>\"Defence and security is a legitimate business and like any other show we run we apply the same very high standards, rigour, experience and skill to organising events in this sector as we do in all of our others. </p> <p>\"Our defence and security exhibitions are just that, exhibitions, no weapons are for sale at the events and any business done would, in any case, be regulated by the toughest export regime in the world. We agree with the UN that the legitimate defence industry, regulated by a binding international treaty, is the best way to end the illegal trade in weapons.\"</p> <p>Bounty, the baby products company that has more than 3 million members in its parenting club, confirmed it was not intending to exhibit at the Baby Show. <br>But it remains a sponsor of the show, with its name featuring prominently at today's event and with a high-profile credit on the Baby Show website. </p> <p>\"We are not exhibiting at the Baby Show this weekend,\" a spokeswoman for Bounty said. </p> <p>Unicef was going to take donations from ticket sales to provide tetanus vaccines, as part of a scheme it runs with Pampers nappies, but decided to sever ties after it learned of the Baby Show's link to DSEi. </p> <p>\"We have taken the matter very seriously and can confirm that we will not be accepting any donations from Clarion Events,\" Unicef said in a statement. </p> <p>\"Clarion Events is not a corporate partner of Unicef UK and we have not received any money from them to date. We would like to make it clear that neither Pampers nor Unicef will be accepting any financial donation by Clarion Events. </p> <p>\"We would like to reassure the public who have already bought tickets to the Baby Show that their donation will be recognised by Pampers who have offered to make an additional donation to the vaccine campaign, covering the entire amount that was expected to be raised from ticket sales.\"</p>",
  "<p>In football, even the most sorry gull, one who has swallowed the Soccer AM &amp; Nike Book Of Showboating Jogo Bonito Bull hook, line and sinker, recognises that substance is as important as swashbuckle. Eric Cantona may be recognised at Old Trafford as the catalyst for the modern-day Manchester United, for example, but everyone there knows in their heart that the whole thing would have been a flash in the pan were it not for Roy Keane.</p> <p>Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with rugby realises that Jonny Wilkinson's boot would have counted for little were he not pretty adept at putting his shoulder into the tackle. Don Bradman wouldn't have had a Test average of nearly 100 if he didn't know when to play it with a straight bat now and then, Muhammad Ali didn't step into the ring windmilling like it was closing time on a Friday night in Basingstoke, Michael Schumacher needed to apply the brakes as often as he pressed on the gas, and\u2026 well, you get the idea.</p> <p>In snooker, however, judgement goes out of the window. Ask anyone who the greatest players in the history of the sport are, and more often than not you'll get the following 1-2-3: Ronnie O'Sullivan, Alex Higgins, Jimmy White. The usual caveat will of course be applied: \"They may not have won so many world titles as Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, but\u2026\"</p> <p>Snooker players are judged in a very strange fashion, all potting, preening and backstory. Now, there's no denying that the sport would be nothing without crowd-pleasers like the Rocket, the Whirlwind and, especially, the greatest pure talent the sport has ever seen, the Hurricane. The three best entertainers, yes. The three greatest rags-to-riches backstories (with the possible exception of Cliff Thorburn's real-life Paul Newman stylings)? Yep. The three best players? Ah. Not quite.</p> <p>Apart from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dViH2UERKBs\">this utterly preposterous Higgins effort</a> \u2013 the greatest break in the history of tournament snooker, a masterclass in brinksmanship, one frame and 59-0 down with two to play in a <em>world semi-final</em>, the exception that proves the rule \u2013 most of these three entertainers' signature moments came away from the white heat of cutting-edge matchplay. While you can't denigrate their outrageous ambidextrous cuemanship one bit, five-minute 147s in best-of-19-frame first-round matches against Mick Price simply do not compare to the staunch efforts of the greatest player the sport has ever seen. A man who gets no credit for his efforts despite \u2013 or perhaps because of \u2013 a period of utter dominance never seen before and unlikely to be seen again.</p> <p>Despite winning seven world titles, Stephen Hendry somehow gets little or no credit for his own, slightly subtler, brand of outrageous showmanship. His problem, of course, is that his upbringing was decidedly uninteresting, putting him instantly on the back foot with a public understandably more taken with stories of youthful hustling and carousing in smoky halls up and down the land. He also has the demeamour of a Dickensian landlord, arriving at the front step, same time every week, in a stovepipe hat to take the rent from baby's mouth. Sadly, this image of middle-class Presbyterian aloofness has obscured the fact that Hendry had a pair of balls the size of the Elgin Marbles.</p> <p>Let's look at the evidence.</p> <p>When 14-8 down in the 1992 world final against Jimmy White, and a red and colour away from losing frame 23, Hendry sank an almost impossible red down the right-hand rail to kick-start his title bid. He cleared the table and won the frame, the first of ten in a row which landed him the crown. White was simply unable to respond.</p> <p>The 1994 world final saw Hendry clear up in the deciding frame after White choked a black from the spot. He did this after playing the entire tournament with a broken left arm. (White, incidentally, still gets pelters for bridling at the final hurdle here, but it's worth remembering that he'd probably have got another chance to tidy up against any other player in the world.)</p> <p>Hendry completed the greatest comeback in the history of tournament snooker, after being 7-0 and 8-2 down in the first-to-nine 1991 Masters final against Mike Hallett. (Check his expression, facing defeat at 8-2 with Hallett in the balls, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrDFFyFF4EQ\">at 1min 38sec here</a>: he simply <em>does not give a flying one</em>.)</p> <p>Hendry nixed potentially the greatest comeback in the history of tournament snooker, after being 8-2 up but pegged back to 8-8 in the first-to-nine 1997 Liverpool Victoria Charity Challenge final by Ronnie O'Sullivan. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe-8l_8BeYk\">He won the final frame \u2013 with a 147.</a> (\"It can't possibly happen,\" exclaims the commentator at 5min 41sec, \"it's not possible!\")</p> <p>He ran in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTizFFIskEI\">the greatest 147 of all</a>, at the World Championship in 1995. Unlike Rocket Ronnie's admittedly astounding and practically perfect first-round effort in 1997 against Price, this was in a semi-final against White when the outcome of the match was still in the balance. He also had to sink an incredibly difficult final black, one of the great pressure pots of all time.</p> <p>And then there's his response to Alex Higgins at the 1991 UK Open. \"Hendry brushed him aside like a beggar at a cashpoint and led 6-2 at the interval,\" recounts Bill Borrows in his <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hurricane-Turbulent-Life-Times-Higgins/dp/1843540118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1224240920&amp;sr=1-1\">must-read biography of Higgins</a>, The Hurricane. \"Higgins appeared in the players room and began a foul-mouthed tirade before making eye contact with Hendry just before the start of the next session. 'Hello,' he announced, 'I'm the devil.' Hendry, resolutely unshocked, went on to win 9-4.\"</p> <p>Essentially, during his glory years, Hendry took everything that was thrown at him, and flung it back with interest. Rarely has there been a British sporting superstar so talented, so determined \u2013 and so under-rated. </p> <p>There's no denying that O'Sullivan has more pure talent, but then the game isn't just about the spectacular, and unlike The Entertainers, Hendry had it all. When he needed to be, he was as outrageous a long potter as anyone to have ever played the sport \u2013 but then he rarely ran out of position, so had to take ludicrous thrashes at the ball less frequently. Nobody, in order to keep the scoreboard ticking over, has ever found the middle pocket with such precision. And rarely, if ever, was Hendry fazed: compare and contrast to Ronnie, who even in his glory era has been known to unravel spectacularly, most famously when he walked out against Hendry mid-match, most instructively when he was whitewashed in a world semi-final session by Graeme Dott. Out-psyched by Graeme Dott, let's just leave that hanging there.</p> <p>It's a shame that the two greatest players of all time, Hendry and O'Sullivan, never competed when both were on top of their game. O'Sullivan hadn't become the force he is now when he was beaten 17-13 by Hendry in the 1999 world semi-final, while Hendry had long traversed the brow of the hill when O'Sullivan returned the favour by walloping him 17-4 in the 2004 semis. Had they, though, and they were competing in a single frame to pay off your credit card, who would you have backed, relentless as O'Sullivan can be on his day?</p> <p>The size of the Elgin Marbles, they were.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has been strongly criticised for its \"continued failure\" to meet its international obligations on tackling \"foreign bribery\" in a damning report published today. </p> <p>An international watchdog called for swift measures to introduce foreign bribery legislation in Britain and to \"establish effective corporate liability for bribery as a matter of high priority\". </p> <p>The demands are made in <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/document/32/0,3343,en_2649_34487_41508320_1_1_1_1,00.html\">a 75-page inquiry report</a> by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's working group on bribery. </p> <p>The OECD, the only international body enforcing anti-bribery accords, launched a review of UK anti-bribery measures in the wake of the 2006 decision of the Serious Fraud Office to drop an investigation into BAE Systems over an arms deal with Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>The result is a hard-hitting condemnation of government failure to implement the OECD's \"anti-bribery convention\", due in force nearly nine years ago. </p> <p>Today's report said: \"The working group is disappointed and seriously concerned with the unsatisfactory implementation of the convention by the UK. </p> <p>\"The continued failure of the UK to address deficiencies in its laws on bribery of foreign public officials and on corporate liability for foreign bribery has hindered investigations. </p> <p>\"The working group reiterates its previous 2003, 2005 and 2007 recommendations that the UK enact new foreign bribery legislation at the earliest possible date.\" </p> <p>The SFO decided to drop the investigation into BAE Systems after being told that this could result in Saudi Arabia refusing to cooperate with British anti-terrorism investigations, with the result that lives could be put at risk. This decision was challenged in the courts, but the House of Lords eventually ruled that the decision was lawful. </p> <p>In its report, the OECD said the government \"did not engage in sufficient efforts to develop and explore alternatives to dropping ... the investigation\".</p> <p>It also said the SFO should consider reopening the investigation if in the future it was satisfied \"that the circumstances that led to the decision to discontinue the investigation sufficiently changed\". </p> <p>The report expresses strong regret about the \"uncertainty\" surrounding the UK's commitment to establish an effective corporate liability regime in line with the convention, as recommended in 2005. </p> <p>It acknowledges measures taken by the UK government to strengthen the fight against foreign bribery, including allocating \"significant\" funds and national jurisdiction to a specialised City of London police unit dealing with foreign bribery investigations. </p> <p>And it notes the UK's first convictions of an individual for foreign bribery in international business transactions came only last month. The government also has introduced an \"anti-corruption strategy\" to improve and strengthen UK foreign bribery laws and structures. </p> <p>However, the report states \"reforms are urgently needed and should be dealt with as a matter of political priority. Recent cases have also highlighted systemic deficiencies that make clear the need to safeguard the independence of the Serious Fraud Office and eliminate unnecessary obstacles and prosecution\". </p> <p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, said the UK was \"fully committed\" to tackling corruption and would study the report's findings carefully. </p> <p>Straw, who was appointed the government's \"anti-corruption champion\" this week, said: \"The government welcomes the working group on bribery's report and will now carefully consider its recommendations, alongside the Law Commission's imminent proposals on bribery law reform. </p> <p>\"Reform of our bribery laws is a key part of the strategy I announced to parliament this week, on my appointment as anti-corruption champion. </p> <p>\"It is crucial that we get these reforms right and I appreciate the OECD's contribution to this process. </p> <p>\"The UK is fully committed to combating foreign bribery, which hurts honest companies and raises the costs of doing business.\"</p>",
  "<p>The new minister for communications, technology and broadcasting, Stephen Carter, is to create a wide-ranging \"action plan\" for the digital media economy that could include greater regulation for the internet.</p> <p>Former Ofcom chief executive and ex-Downing Street strategy director Carter will prepare a report, called Digital Britain, which will look at \"a range of issues affecting internet users, such as user security and safety and a workable approach to promoting content standards\".</p> <p>The report will \"consider what future legislative and non-legislative measures are required to support the development of these critical sectors,\" according to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</p> <p>An interim report is due in January, before the action plan is unveiled in the spring.</p> <p>The outcome of Digital Britain is likely to contain three tiers: proposals that can be set in motion straight away; those that require some legislation; and those that are long-term visions. </p> <p>Carter will not have a formal panel of advisers to help him, but will talk to all government departments and pull together the myriad of recent reports about convergence, including Ofcom's second review of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>Last month, the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, said the government planned to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/26/digitalmedia.internet\">crack down on the internet to \"even up\" the regulatory imbalance with television</a>.</p> <p>Another area that the report will examine will be how to achieve \"universal access to high-quality, public service content through appropriate mechanisms for a converged digital age\".</p> <p>Also on the agenda are: broadband development, digital radio, investment in content, spectrum, the internet, media literacy and IT skills, public service broadcasting and independent production. </p> <p>When at Ofcom, Carter tried to solve the PSB issue with a proposal for a so-called \"public service publisher\", a quango that would allocate money for PSB content and show programmes on broadband. </p> <p>Burnham called Digital Britain a \"change of gear for the government\". </p> <p>The report - which will be published in spring 2009 - \"has at its core an ambition to accelerate the rate of growth, and cement the UK's position as a world leader in the knowledge and learning economy\", according to the DCMS. </p> <p>Carter said: \"Our ambition is to see Digital Britain as the leading major economy for innovation, investment and quality in the digital and communications industries. </p> <p>\"We will seek to bring forward a unified framework to help maximise the UK's competitive advantage and the benefits to society.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state for business, Peter Mandelson, said: \"For the present financial and banking crisis, Britain must get through the worst and prepare for the upturn. </p> <p>\"The digital economy will be central to this.

  "<p>A man who planned the murder of a former friend from his cell in a high-security prison was jailed today for a minimum of 30 years.</p> <p>Delphon Nicholas, 29, from Lewisham, south London, organised the execution of 26-year-old Andrew Wanoghu while an inmate in Belmarsh prison, south London.</p> <p>Wanoghu was shot in the street after being lured to an address in Brockley, south London, in April 2006.

  "<p>As a species, we often appear to have two deeply held but conflicting attitudes towards the period of our lives that we call childhood. On the one hand, children are seen as fragile, innocent and in need of protection. On the other, they are seen as inherently corrupt and threatening and we set up rituals, ranging from religious initiations to ASBOs, to protect ourselves from them.<br> This almost Manichaean duality in our attitude to the young is often found in media and politics, but it fails to reflect a reality that is much more complex. Fortunately, we can turn to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/poetry\">poetry</a> of childhood for a picture that is more subtle and suffused with finer gradations of colour and tone. <br> The poetry of childhood is rarely simple; even an apparently straightforward poem of childhood memory, <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=\" 171947\" \">At the Sea-Side</a> by Robert Louis Stevenson, has a deeper undercurrent running just below the surface. We are reminded that even children are subject to the tide that governs our affairs.<br> Dylan Thomas, in the great hymn to the joys of youth that is <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=\" 175908\" \">Fern Hill</a>, is at pains to remind us that even in these almost mystical transports of discovery, time lurks in the background and holds us \"green and dying\". Anne Stevenson's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=180223\">Four and a Half Dancing Men</a> tells an even starker truth: our children must destroy what we give them in order to make a thing their own.<br> Of course, we can grow to be grateful for the gifts our parents give us and the sacrifices they make for us, and this sense of gratitude is found in Diane Wakoski's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176003\">Thanking My Mother for Piano Lessons</a>. Sometimes these gifts are less tangible: in Robert Lowell's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=177953\">My Last Afternoon with Uncle Devereux Winslow</a> they appear to be a sense of the self and others and the growing independence this brings with it along with a first awareness of the meaning of death.<br> For the adult, a gift to a child can carry with it memories of their own childhood and a sense of regret for all that they have lost. These feelings emerge, in very different ways, in Hilaire Belloc's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176026\">On the Gift of a Book to a Child</a> and Kenneth Rexroth's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171527\">Proust's Madeleine</a>. <br> One of the great arenas of childhood is, of course, the playground. Toys and games are ways for children to expand their physical and mental capacities and to learn to understand the world they find themselves in. To adults, the games that children choose to engage in can often seem odd, to say the least. This may be because, as in <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=177870\">Mary Barnard's Playroom</a>, the play is unexpectedly grave. Denise Levertov, in a poem called <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171238\">Partial Resemblance</a>, reminds us that the qualities that a child finds most important in her toys may not be those that an adult values. Most strikingly, perhaps, E E Cummings' poem <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176657\">in Just-</a> shows that play, to the adult eye at least, is sometimes just plain weird. <br> And then, of course, there are those poets who just do not get childhood at all, try as they may. I mean, what are we to make of a poet who can, with no trace of irony, call one of his works <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174791\">Influence of Natural Objects in Calling Forth and Strengthening the Imagination in Boyhood and Early Youth</a>?<br> And so, this week's theme is childhood. Up to the attic with you and drag out those early memories. Run with them, play with them, share them here.</p>",
  "<p>A draft agreement that would see US combat forces withdrawn from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraqi</a> towns and cities by the middle of next year is being considered by US officials.</p> <p>Baghdad and Washington have been negotiating for seven months over the continued role of troops in the country after a UN security council mandate expires on December 31.

Mandelson introduced an order to allow the merger of HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p><strong>Football</strong></p> <p>Norman Lamb (Lib Dem, Norfolk North) urged the government to look into \"very serious allegations\" of match-fixing in a Championship football match. </p> <p>He said \"very unusual betting patterns\" had taken place on a game between Norwich City and Derby on October 4. </p> <p>Harman told Lamb she would ask the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, to write to him. </p> <p><strong>Shares</strong></p> <p>The short selling of shares is \"a wart on the face of capitalism\", pension fund manager Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, warned. </p> <p>He said it was \"very dangerous\" and \"effectively a bet against the taxpayer\" and added that \"hedge-fund hyenas\" should not be allowed to do it. </p> <p>Lord Davies of Oldham, for the government, said: \"In the extreme turbulence in the markets short selling played its part in aggravating the problem.

  "<p>When Robert Frank travelled across the country in 1955 to take photographs for the book he called The Americans, he inspired a younger generation to follow his example. Since then many photographers have made personal journeys to take the cultural and political temperature of the United States, but none has done so with more conviction than Joel Sternfeld. </p> <p>Supported, as Frank had been, by a Guggenheim fellowship, Sternfeld set off cross-country in 1978, driving a camper van. His quest, he says, was that \"of someone who grew up with a vision of classical regional America and the order it seemed to contain, to find beauty and harmony in an increasingly uniform, technological and disturbing America.\" The photographs that resulted would become his first, now classic book, <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/87-American-Prospects.html\">American Prospects</a>.</p> <p>Sternfeld is part of a line that began with the photographer-explorers of the 19th century and was continued in the 20th, particularly by <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/photography/photographerframe.php?photographerid=ph022\">Walker Evans</a>, with his 1938 book American Photographs, and then by Frank. Indeed, when Frank put in his Guggenheim application, Evans was one of his referees. But whereas Frank had stipulated that he wanted to use the \"miniature\" hand-held camera \"exclusively\", Sternfeld was seeking another form with which to portray the contemporary landscape. Ironically, considering the final outcome, he'd been given his grant money in order to continue a series of New York street photographs, in colour, using the same type of camera that Frank had used for The Americans. But whereas it allowed Frank to achieve spontaneous, sometimes covert-seeming glimpses of American life that made his work so personal, Sternfeld felt the hand-held approach would no longer serve his needs. By the time he took to the road, he had abandoned the small camera and determined to make another kind of picture altogether. </p> <p>He took with him an 8\" x10\" view camera similar to those used by pioneering photographers such as Carleton Watkins a century before. The large format allowed him to focus on the details of individual experience and yet show it in its wider context. It was an approach that echoed the importance the landscape played as a backdrop to the small-town dramas of 1970s American cinema, and to the way small, individual experiences found universal significance in the short stories of Raymond Carver. His use of colour and the all-over detailing on the picture plane enabled Sternfeld to establish his own strain of colour landscape photography.</p> <p>Since then he has used it to investigate aspects of American society in a series of books. On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam, published in 1996, made a record of 50 locations in America where acts of violence had occurred. Some were well known: the Dallas cinema where Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in 1963, or the corner in Los Angeles where Rodney King, an African-American, was beaten by four white policemen in 1992, inciting the Los Angeles riots. Others were sites of local tragedies: the street in Des Moines, Iowa, from which a 12-year-old paperboy disappeared while on his rounds in 1982, and the bus shelter in front of the housing department in Washington DC where a woman froze to death after being turned away from a homeless shelter. Cumulatively, they presented a picture of a society in trouble. </p> <p>Stranger Passing used portraits of ordinary Americans to explore ideas about image and class; Walking the High Line was a series of sequential landscapes that recorded the derelict New York central railroad track, an elevated stretch of goods track that ran along the west side of Manhattan and was scheduled for demolition. In Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America he photographed alternative communities, from the Gesundheit! Institute in West Virginia, and its plans \"to humanise health care\", to cohousing communities, based on ecologically sound principles. </p> <p>He has worked during a time when digital technology and staged photography have undermined the assumption that a documentary photograph is a record rather than a construction, and yet Sternfeld has (so far as I know) never resorted to staging as such. Two of his best-known pictures, both from American Prospects, are entitled Exhausted Renegade Elephant, Woodland, Washington (1979) and McLean, Virginia (1978). The first shows an elephant collapsed in the middle of a suburban highway with a truck, a small group of onlookers and the sheriff in attendance. The other depicts a farmer's market, with a stack of orange pumpkins out front; in the background a house is on fire with flames pouring from its roof. The flames are exactly the same shade of orange as the pumpkins. A customer standing casually at the market with a pumpkin under one arm turns out to be a fireman, bagging a pumpkin or two while his colleagues tackle the blaze. In the present photographic climate, such pictures might have been assumed to be fictions, but in Sternfeld's case they were repayment for his diligence; chance encounters in the strange and disturbing reality of American life.</p> <p>None of these surveys, it has to be said, are particularly optimistic, giving the lie to the ideal of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Much of what he photographed, from American Prospects on, shows brokenness and decay, whether in old industrial plants, wrecked automobiles, ugly contemporary housing developments, or people whose demeanour reflects displacement and disorientation. But there is also a sense of the absurdities of life, of humour, and even hope among the photographs to offset a blanket statement of defeat. </p> <p>Now, though, he is publishing two new books which, taken together, constitute his most political statement so far, and it is no surprise that his investment in the American landscape over the past 30 years should have brought him to its largest and most intractable problem: climate change. When It Changed is a small paperback book of portraits, taken in 2005 at the eleventh United Nations conference on climate change in Montreal. The portraits are, collectively, faces of concern, but the text that accompanies them, culled from reports in the international press since 1957 (though the majority covers the past 20 years), are an indictment of the apathetic disinclination of America, and the world as a whole, to pay attention to the warnings, scientific and anecdotal, that the planet is heading for self-destruction. Though the conference portraits are a consistently strong photographic element, this book lacks any redeeming beauty. It is a bleak handbook for the future, and should be issued to every family in the land. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339280628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/11/03/joel46022.jpg\" alt=\" Changing climate ... image of a field from Oxbow Archive.

Taken in isolation, Oxbow Archive might appear to be a serene study of the way one particular stretch of landscape - a field within the oxbow of the Connecticut river in Massachusetts - changes with the seasons over the course of a year. But when it is seen, as Sternfeld intends, as the third part of a trilogy with When It Changed, and Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias, any innocent pleasure is replaced by the realisation that this ordinary field is threatened by the changing climate, and may never appear quite the same again. </p> <p>The Oxbow field appears in one of the famous paintings of the American sublime: View From Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, After a Thunderstorm (The Oxbow), painted by Thomas Cole in 1833. Sternfeld first photographed it in 1978, as part of American Prospects. The photographs in this new book seem to express everything that Sternfeld believes in and holds dear. These pictures come from a moral sense of the fragility of the landscape, and from a belief in what photography can do to express the temporary nature of the Earth - and, possibly, to assist in its preservation.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/426-When-it-Changed.html\">When It Changed</a>, by Joel Sternfeld, published by Steidl, \u00a340.<br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.steidlville.com/books/782-Oxbow-Archive.html\">Oxbow Archive</a>, by Joel Sternfeld, published by Steidl, \u00a317.50.</p>",
  "<p>The work print is the holy grail of film collecting. These are the vastly long, rough versions of a picture, containing much of the movie-making fat that is trimmed out by the editing process. For years, film collectors tap their keyboards until their fingers bleed in attempts to track down the bum-numbing versions of movies such as Dune and This Is Spinal Tap for the unseen gems they may or may not hold. </p> <p>Of all the legendary work prints out there, the most persistently tantalising prospect is seeing the rumoured 289-minute version of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. The theatrical release print runs a mere 153 minutes, and the Redux reissue 202 minutes, so the work print offers almost an hour and a half of unseen footage. To a serious film geek, the prospect is unthinkably exciting - surely it couldn't be true?</p> <p>Despite a lack of tangible proof that it even existed - including denials from the film's producers - the most dedicated collectors spent years searching for it, until something supposed to be this grail-like object found its way into the public domain. After exhaustive negotiations with an American film collector who had tracked down a copy, I found myself signing for an airmail package, booking the day off work and settling down for some serious viewing.</p> <p>The first thing to point out is that to call this five-hour work print a \"rough cut\" is a mistake. It's an \"everything-and-the-kitchen-sink\" cut, which takes almost all the material from the 238-day shoot and tapes it together in a linear form. The work print moves at a snail's pace, with unfeasibly long scenes. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter episode alone accounts for well over 30 minutes of footage. Scenes that, with expert editing, would become tense and compelling simply drift along aimlessly, interesting only to anoraks for the extra line of dialogue here and there.</p> <p>There are, however, gems amid the mass of footage, which leave the viewer wondering how Coppola could have taken the scissors to them. Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz has three extra scenes, which more than quadruple the size of his part. In one, Brando reads from Time magazine to an imprisoned Martin Sheen. In another he delivers a monologue to Sheen about the \"master liars\" in Washington who \"want to win, but can't stand to be thought of as cruel\". In a third, he reads TS Eliot's The Hollow Men, while Dennis Hopper gets excited and says \"man\" a lot.</p> <p>One of the things removed from the film for the cinematic release, along with the extra footage, is its political conscience. Scenes in which the characters question and criticise the US involvement in Vietnam and the conduct of American government are cut. Themes of politics give way to an exploration of the human nature and psychology.</p> <p>Of all the cuts, the unkindest are dealt to Scott Glenn's character, Colby, Willard's predecessor, who was charged with killing Kurtz, but instead falls under his spell. In the work print, Colby is revealed to be a significant character who taunts an imprisoned Willard and, more importantly, shoots Hopper's character before being killed himself. Likewise, the character of Lance (played by Sam Bottoms) gets extra scenes designed to show his instability. In one, he inexplicably machine-guns a water buffalo, while screaming: \"I control the destiny of every living thing which passes before my sights.\"</p> <p>It took Coppola and his editors more than 700 days to turn a million feet of celluloid into a watchable film. What the work print makes clear are the choices editors are forced to make when faced with almost unlimited footage. Scenes that drove the crew to the brink of madness and Coppola to the edge of financial ruin were dropped without sentiment - simply because they didn't improve the story.</p>",
  "<p>European leaders arrived in Brussels on Wednesday for another quarterly <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-10/15/content_10200561.htm\">summit</a> meeting dominated by crisis management. Last August it was the Russia-Georgia war; in June it was Ireland's no vote on the Lisbon treaty. Now, of course, it's the banking crisis.</p> <p>Indeed, some believe crisis management is what the EU does best \u2013 and even that one crisis can be the antidote to another. For <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2008/10/15/01003-20081015ARTFIG00287-les-crises-ont-ressoude-l-union-europeenne-.php \">Le Figaro</a>, the EU's performance during the financial crisis could serve as a lesson to the Irish on why they should vote yes to the Lisbon treaty second time round. EU member states were initially tempted to go it alone, pursuing beggar-thy-neighbour policies to shore up their own financial systems. Yet within 10 days most realised that only a pan-European plan would do, and came within the EU fold.</p> <p>The problem is that the EU isn't actually very good at crisis management. It can certainly be a useful way of hiding internal political disagreements behind the rhetoric of pan-European consensus and cooperation. In a national context, we'd call this a fudge. But because it's the EU, a fudge is considered a success \u2013 an exercise in progressive European-style compromise politics.</p> <p>For an example, let's go back to February 2008, when Kosovo declared itself independent. A raging disagreement broke out within the EU, pitting the Spanish, Romanians, Slovaks and Cypriots against the other member states. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/04/kosovo.serbia\">One side</a> saw in Kosovo's independence a challenge to the principle of territorial integrity and a dangerous precedent for other secessionist conflicts. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/10/helpkosovostayfree\">The other</a> believed Kosovo's independence posed no immediate dangers and could be safely managed by the EU's overlord, the international civilian representative. To avoid the charge of weakness and bury this disagreement behind a show of unity, member states agreed to launch a rule of law mission in Kosovo, <a href=\"http://www.eulex-kosovo.eu/\">Eulex</a>, their largest and most ambition mission to date. The point of Eulex at the time was to distract attention from a divided EU and to demonstrate collective European resolve on the Kosovo issue, thus burying the vexed question of Kosovo's independence.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Eulex has not extracted itself from the underlying political disagreement over Kosovo's rightful status. Since February, very little has happened. Eulex's authority has been rejected by Kosovan Serbs, who believe it represents a de facto recognition of Kosovo's independence, and it will probably only be fully deployed by early 2009, more than 6 months late. The political will behind Eulex has waned. Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, hasn't made a public speech supporting it since February. Even the head of Eulex, the French general Yves de Kermabon, has begun to justify the mission on merely technical grounds, distancing it from its more political implications and origins. This is the reality of EU crisis management: internal political conflicts are resolved in a way that eschews principles in favour of pragmatism. The actual impact of the EU on the ground figures only as an afterthought.</p> <p>Georgia is another example. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/russia.georgia1\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> made a great fuss about the importance of the EU being number one broker in the conflict. He travelled to Moscow and to Tbilisi and secured an interim peace agreement. Speaking to the European parliament in late August, his foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, applauded the fact that this time, when foreign ministers had to meet at the drop of a hat and decide what to do over Georgia, they were all in agreement. A positive contrast, argued Kouchner, from the divisions and acrimony over Iraq in 2003, the last time foreign ministers met at such short notice.</p> <p>Again, the point of EU diplomacy was to manage the conflicting interests of its member states more than any principled defence of Georgian sovereignty. The EU has deployed a monitoring mission to survey Russia's retreat from Georgian territory. But the question of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence is a moot point. The talks that were due to begin between Russia and Georgia in Geneva yesterday, mediated by the EU, would have pointedly avoided this fundamental issue. In the working groups on security and humanitarian issues, all name plates indicating the origin of the participants were removed \u2013 as if this kind of false anonymity could efface the dominant political question of Georgia's territorial borders and the status of its breakaway provinces.</p> <p>This is vintage EU: to bury the political disagreement under a mound of negotiations, working groups and consensus-seeking initiatives, then dress it all up as a glorious example of the EU's progressive \"soft power\", free from grubby realpolitik or national interests. The reality is that the EU's impact on the ground is as negative and destabilising as any egotistical nation state. It's time we did away with the rhetoric of \"soft power\" and called national governments to account for the fudge that is EU crisis management.</p> <p><em>Chris Bickerton is chairing a forthcoming debate on the EU at the <a href=\"http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/\">Battle of Ideas</a></em>.</p>",
  "<p>A question. What adjective is most closely associated with Barack Obama on Google, and what epithet is linked with John McCain? Answers: \"professorial\" and \"fighter-pilot\", respectively. </p> <p>This is what the 2008 gladiatorial combat has boiled down to: mortarboards versus flying helmets. Swots versus warriors.</p> <p>The standard descriptions of Barack, in newspaper reports of the presidential debates, have been: \"cool\", \"detached\", \"wry\" and - time and again -\"professorial\". </p> <p>And McCain? \"Hot-tempered\" comes up routinely, as does \"aggressive\" (\"Grumpy McNasty\" has also been popular). </p> <p>\"Academic\", although not as dirty a word as \"liberal, is not something any politician wants strung round their neck. It suggests ivory-tower unworldliness. </p> <p>\"Professorial\", on the other hand, is what Orwell calls a \"plusword\". You can be a professor and worldly.</p> <p>Professors have not, of course, always been admired by real-world politicians. George Wallace was scathing about \"pointy-headed professors that can't park a bicycle straight\".</p> <p>Henry Kissinger (a Harvard prof in his early years) memorably declared that he would rather have as president of the United States anyone in the first 100 pages of the Boston telephone directory rather than someone on the Harvard faculty. No pointy-heads in the White House, thank you very much.</p> <p>None the less, \"professorial\" has worked powerfully for Obama in this keenly contested election. Why?<br> Four reasons suggest themselves: </p> <p>\u2022 First: do a free-association exercise on the word \"professorial\". What image comes to mind? My guess is: \"dignified white male\". To be blunt, \"professorial\" works against the stock associations of \"African-American\" - or less savoury variants of that term. It subliminally blanches the candidate.</p> <p>\u2022 The second reason, I suspect, is that American professors have scooped up all the Nobel prizes this month for science and social science. </p> <p>Particularly relevant is the economics award, won by Paul Krugman. Krugman is a distinguished professor at Princeton, a syndicated op-ed columnist on the New York Times, and a relentless critic of Bush's.</p> <p>\u2022 There's a feeling that whereas fighter-pilot aggression might help in the hills of Afghanistan, it's not going to get America out of the ditch into which George Bush (another ex-fighter pilot) and his deregulation policies have crashed his country. </p> <p>It's not dash and derring-do that's needed, but thoughtful reflection. Not warriors, but professors. Enter \"professorial\" Obama.</p> <p>Barack Obama is very brainy. An alumnus of Columbia and Harvard, he was president of the Harvard Law Review. He could easily have followed an academic track and, at 47, would surely by now have been, yes, a very distinguished professor, had he not elected, instead, to become the most powerful man in the world. If, that is, his country so elects.</p> <p>Time and again, Obama (unlike his opponent) has stressed how vital it is for working and middle-class Americans to be able to send their kids to college. </p> <p>What's the current package at an Ivy League institution? Around $50K a year. If you've got three children, and are in receipt of the national average income (under $50K, as it happens) what hope do you have of doing what Obama and his wife, in a more generous era, managed to do? The American dream is just too expensive, nowadays, for the Barack Obamas and Michelle Robinsons.</p> <p>Famously, Obama and his wife have barely finished paying their student loans. Democracy, Obama asserts - and demonstrates in his own career - depends as much on assisted access to higher education as on invading Middle Eastern oil-rich countries. Most professors would agree with him.</p> <p>\u2022 It used to be pastors who led the African-American community. Dr Martin Luther King broke the mould. He was a preacher with a PhD (no president of the US, incidentally, has had an earned, as opposed to an honorary, doctorate). Now black professors are moving into leadership roles.</p> <p>In spite of what I described above as the male-whiteness of the term, there are nowadays a significant number of African-American professors of both sexes among the very top echelon of \"public intellectuals\". </p> <p>They include: Cornel West III (Princeton); Henry Louis Gates Jr (Harvard); Houston A. Baker Jr (Vanderbilt); Toni Morrison (Princeton). And, of course, there is Condoleeza Rice (formerly president of Stanford, before that, a professor there). There is, in short, a black professoriate. And it is an increasingly powerful player in American public life. Obama slips easily into that company.</p> <p>If Obama wins - and the polls strongly suggest he will - it will be because of, not in spite of, his professorial demeanour. Professors, for the moment, are cool. And admired for being level-headed, not pointy-headed. Gaudeamus.</p>",

is that the free enterprise economy is now deprived of legitimacy, and that only increased, permanent state intervention can save us from a repetition of the problems we face.</p> <p>These critics also assert that the centre-right has no solution and the change we need is a turn to the left.</p> <p>They are wrong.</p> <p>My argument today is that the change we need is the modern Conservatism that I have been advocating.</p> <p>In Birmingham a few weeks ago I explained that the central political idea underlying my Conservatism is the idea of responsibility.</p> <p>Not freedom, which some may wrongly assume is the animating force of Conservatism \u2013 but responsibility.</p> <p>The problem with freedom is that it can too easily tip over into licence \u2013 the idea that people can do whatever they please regardless of the consequences for others.</p> <p>And that is exactly what has happened to our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, we have seen a total breakdown of economic responsibility.</p> <p>From the government, as it has spent and borrowed without restraint.</p> <p>And from our financial sector, which has taken decisions which have harmed the rest of our economy. </p> <p>So it is not more freedom that our economy needs; it is more responsibility.</p> <p>Just as this Party under my leadership has stood for social responsibility, now it must stand also for economic responsibility.</p> <p>We've had irresponsible capitalism presided over by irresponsible government.</p> <p>Instead, what we need is responsible free enterprise, regulated and supported by responsible government.</p> <p>Today, I want to set out how we got to where we are \u2013 financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>I will show how a responsible government should act to mitigate the immediate effects of the crisis.</p> <p>Because though Gordon Brown is trying to rescue the banks, we now need a plan to rescue the economy.</p> <p>And I will show what we need to do to establish the centre-right alternative, which consists of fiscal responsibility, financial responsibility and a balanced economy.</p> <p>The crisis that we face has deep roots.</p> <p>We all know the simplistic version.</p> <p>People in America were given sub-prime mortgages they couldn't afford.</p> <p>The banks devised new ways of chopping up debt and selling it on.</p> <p>No one understood the assets they were buying.</p> <p>So when the merry-go-around stopped, it all came tumbling down.</p> <p>That's all true.</p> <p>But it's only half the truth.</p> <p>It's only by understanding the deeper causes of this crisis that can we hope to find the long-term cures.</p> <p>The underlying dynamic was this global boom presented those in charge of economic management in Britain with a temptation\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and they succumbed to it.</p> <p>And the result was a combination of irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government that has brought us to instability and our present crisis.</p> <p>Over the past two decades, two billion people - a third of the world's population - left subsistence agriculture and joined the global economy. </p> <p>The result was cheaper goods for all of us in the west, and an enormous increase in wealth among those who began to trade. </p> <p>It's why some economists call the Consumer Price Index - or CPI - the \"China Price Index\".</p> <p>The new middle classes in the east, and their governments, saved a huge proportion of their new wealth. </p> <p>For example in China, for a time, the average family saved over half its income. </p> <p>These savings were invested in the West, giving us and our governments the licence to borrow from overseas like never before. </p> <p>In Britain we took advantage of this new debt without stopping to think of the consequences. </p> <p>In other words, the emerging economies offered us a cheap loan, and we borrowed and spent like there was no tomorrow. </p> <p>Low inflation meant that interest rates could stay low and the financial system found new ways of channelling this flood of money into asset prices and debt.</p> <p>Government made things worse.</p> <p>The Chancellor who prided himself on prudence came to believe that he uniquely in the history of economics had ended the trade cycle and abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>So he thought the good days would never end, and borrowed and borrowed and borrowed, and racked up the biggest government deficit in the developed world. </p> <p>And he stood aside as our households racked up over a trillion pounds of personal debt. </p> <p>So when the boom did turn to bust and the value of assets fell our financial system was hit harder than most.</p> <p>The Government couldn't complain about financial institutions lending too much money because the Government itself was borrowing too much from them.</p> <p>Added to this was a regulatory mistake that I believe history will judge as one of the most irresponsible.</p> <p>Rather than trying to restrain lending, in 1997 the Government removed the Bank of England's historic ability to ensure that banking credit was kept within responsible limits.</p> <p>The one organisation with the experience, and authority, to call time on debt was taken out of the picture.</p> <p>It is now clear that the resulting, irresponsible borrowing by both private and public sectors was unsustainable.</p> <p>As the head of the Financial Service Authority, Lord Turner, has said, they \"allowed a boom to go on for too long\".</p> <p>So why did our Government let this happen?</p> <p>Was it negligence \u2013 or was it intentional?</p> <p>There is a strong case for saying it was intentional.</p> <p>New Labour took a new approach to economic and social policy.</p> <p>Having previously opposed free market economics, they decided to accept it without question, seeing it as a 'black box' to produce ever-growing tax revenues\u2026</p> <p>\u2026without properly understanding how it worked.</p> <p>The intention was to ride the wave of debt-fuelled growth to fund top-down government programmes in an attempt to \"guarantee fairness\".</p> <p>Of course, these mistakes were not only made in Britain.</p> <p>In other countries, too, excessive debt and irresponsible capitalism have led to serious crises, with implications for the whole world's financial system.</p> <p>The problems are now global and \u2013 as I argued back in March when I discussed the need for changes in the Basel Accords \u2013 some of the solutions will indeed need to be global.</p> <p>We all agree about that. </p> <p>But we mustn't let that consensus hide the truth.</p> <p>The underlying failures of policy were national.</p> <p>The failure to regulate U.S. sub-prime mortgages was an American failure.</p> <p>And the failure to regulate public and private debt in Britain was a British failure.</p> <p>It was a failure Gordon Brown was warned about time and again. </p> <p>And time and again he ignored those warnings. </p> <p>Four years ago he was telling the city: \"I want us to do even more to encourage the risk takers\".</p> <p>Two years ago, he was dismissing calls for what he called a \"regulatory crackdown\" on the City. </p> <p>And only last year, he was celebrating what he called a \"golden age for the City of London\"\u2026.</p> <p>\u2026Now he's describing that very same time an \"Age of Irresponsibility\". </p> <p>\"A Golden Age\" to an \"Age of Irresponsibility\" \u2013 in less than a year. That's what I call a Rock of Stability.</p> <p>Does Gordon Brown really think he's going to get away with that?</p> <p>He cannot hide from his mistakes. </p> <p>He cannot hide from the truth.</p> <p>The truth that over the past ten years, Britain has built up more personal debt than any other major economy in history. </p> <p>The truth that house prices rose higher in the UK than even in the US. </p> <p>The truth that the boom has now turned to bust. </p> <p>And perhaps most damning of all, the truth that while all economies have been hit by this financial crisis, Britain's banking bail-out has had to be the biggest in the world. </p> <p>So let me set out exactly where we've come to. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's policies \u2013 his entire economic strategy - has fundamentally failed. </p> <p>The first result of this failure in domestic policy in the UK was a debt-induced asset bubble in the private sector that has now burst, generating both downturn and serious threats to the stability of our financial system.</p> <p>The second result of this failure in UK policy is that our Government \u2013 having spent all the money in the good years - is less able to help people in this country get through this downturn than the government of almost any other developed country.</p> <p>The Government's deficit is so big that the cupboard is now bare.</p> <p>The third result of this failure of UK policy is that excessive debt-fuelled fiscal expansion, allied to rising raw material prices, has driven the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher \u2013 for longer - than they would otherwise be in order to control inflation.</p> <p>That's put further pressure on families, businesses and our financial institutions.</p> <p>And let's be clear what all this all now means in the real economy.</p> <p>We've got more and more families unable to make the mortgage repayments and losing their homes.</p> <p>We've got more and more good businesses going to the wall because they can't get the credit.</p> <p>And we've got more and more people losing their jobs through no fault of their own.</p> <p>And to this Government and to these Ministers who say that anyone mentioning these things is somehow \"talking Britain down\", everyone knows what you're trying to do \u2013 to close down debate, to shut people's eye, to hide the truth\u2026</p> <p>\u2026to mask your failures.</p> <p>I will never pull my punches in explaining how this Government has brought Britain down.</p> <p>The immediate consequence of all this is, of course, a combination of financial crisis and economic downturn.</p> <p>Before I address the question of how to prevent this from happening again, I want to talk about how we deal with the immediate crisis \u2013 to reduce, so far as possible, the pain suffered by families and businesses over the coming months.</p> <p>And I want to take head-on an idea that has been suggested in some quarters \u2013 the idea that the centre-right's whole economic philosophy is somehow undermined by our support for state action at this juncture.</p> <p>We did support the action taken to re-capitalise banks.</p> <p>Given the irresponsible levels of debt in our economy, it was the only way to minimise the downturn in the real economy \u2013 a downturn costly not only to families and businesses but also to the fiscal accounts.</p> <p>And as I've said two weeks ago, \"there is only one thing worse than state aid for banks, and that is doing nothing\".</p> <p>It was an action that had to be supported by any responsible, centre-right Party.</p> <p>But stabilising the financial system is not by any means enough.</p> <p>In the coming downturn, with unemployment already sharply rising, with real pain for many small businesses, many home-owners, many pensioners and many others besides \u2013 we cannot stand idly by.</p> <p>Some of the strain is being taken by monetary policy \u2013 as the Bank of England responds to circumstances in its decisions on interest rates.</p> <p>Another part of the strain will automatically be taken by the cyclical elements of the fiscal policy.</p> <p>In a downturn, tax revenues will decrease and spending on benefits will increase \u2013 the so-called 'automatic stabilisers'.</p> <p>This will help to counter deflationary pressures.</p> <p>And in the process, it will, of course, add to even further public sector borrowing \u2013 that is the inevitable consequence of economic downturn.</p> <p>But it only re-enforces the point that we have consistently made that it was irresponsible for the Government to borrow so much when the economy was booming.</p> <p>And to those who say we have not been consistent on this, I say go and read our 2005 election manifesto, which we fought on a commitment to cut waste principally to bring down government borrowing.</p> <p>In some countries, like Australia and Sweden, people and businesses can also be helped through significant tax-cuts that are affordable because governments did save for a rainy day.</p> <p>John Howard's responsible fiscal policies now put people in Australia in a very different position from us.</p> <p>But, even if upfront net tax cuts are much more difficult for us than for Australia, we can at least seek to minimise pain on families by preventing those taxes that most affect them from going up.</p> <p>That's why we'll freeze council tax for two years by reducing wasteful spending on advertising and consultancy in central government.</p> <p>There are, however, further, pro-active steps that government itself needs to take \u2013 and which any responsible party of the centre-right can and should support.</p> <p>These are actions to change the law in order to prevent vicious circles of insolvency making the downturn worse than it need otherwise be.</p> <p>That is why we have already proposed to reform insolvency law, to give sound companies breathing space when they face credit problems. </p> <p>And we should immediately suspend the annuities rule, which forces people to buy an annuity at retirement or at age 75. </p> <p>The current volatile markets mean that many pensioners are forced by this rule to lock in lower incomes for the rest of their lives.<br> Over the coming weeks and months we will set out many more ways to help families through the downturn.</p> <p>But short term action to get through the crisis is not enough. </p> <p>We need a long-term plan to rebuild our economy.<br> In a single phrase, we need to change from irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible Government, to responsible free enterprise and responsible Government. Just as I have made the case for social responsibility in our social reforms, our long term plan is based on the principle of economic responsibility. The principles that underpin our social reforms and our economic reforms are the same. That's hardly surprising. </p> <p>After all, to understand how an economy functions, you need to understand far more than the exchange rate and the money supply.<br> The centre right understands that society and the economy are both made up of the same thing: people. You need to get the incentives right, get the framework right, and give people responsibility to do the right thing.</p> <p>You also need people to know that they will be punished if they do the wrong thing.</p> <p>Just as we've argued in welfare, that if you don't accept a good offer of a job you should be denied your benefits\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so too should we say to bankers if you don't succeed, you shouldn't get your bonus.</p> <p>As George Osborne said in his conference speech in Birmingham, it's about demanding responsibility from all of your society \u2013 no matter what your wealth or income. </p> <p>We set out our plan for economic responsibility at conference.<br> It has three central elements. Fiscal responsibility - the Government must live within its means. Financial responsibility - you cannot build an economy on debt. And a balanced economy - as you cannot rely on unsustainable growth in a few areas to increase prosperity for everyone. The free enterprise economy, which has lifted billions out of poverty, is the fairest, strongest and most effective wealth-creator the world has ever known and we would be so much the worse off if we abandoned it. </p> <p>We shouldn't replace the free-market \u2013 we've got to repair it.</p> <p>Repairing our public finances.</p> <p>Repairing our financial services.</p> <p>Repairing our skills, infrastructure, and enterprise culture \u2013 to create a balanced economy.</p> <p>So let me set out exactly what we will do.</p> <p>First, we need to get our public finances back in order \u2013 the traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>This means having the character and judgement to impose discipline.</p> <p>That means discipline in opposition.</p> <p>No spending commitments which will never be delivered.</p> <p>No promises of upfront, unfunded tax cuts which will never happen.</p> <p>Instead, responsibly focusing on what can \u2013 and cannot \u2013 be done.</p> <p>And it means discipline in government.</p> <p>Saying 'no' more than 'yes'.</p> <p>Not borrowing to try and buy yourself a by-election.</p> <p>Living within your means.</p> <p>Cutting the costs of social failure, reforming public services and clamping down on public waste.</p> <p>Spending responsibly, borrowing responsibly and saving responsibly\u2026</p> <p>\u2026so in the long-term we can cut taxes responsibly.</p> <p>But to help governments stick to the right course, we need radical a plan for fiscal policy.</p> <p>So we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility \u2013 which will hold every government to account.</p> <p>And to those who say this is just a duplication of what's already there, or just an admission of politicians' inability to take tough decisions, I say: \"wrong on all counts\".</p> <p>It will have far more authority than a select committee or a Westminster think-tank.</p> <p>But, it will not be a substitute for making tough decisions on tax and spending. </p> <p>We will not, as some have wrongly assumed, be subcontracting this core function of government.</p> <p>Quite the reverse: it is because we are so serious about taking those tough decisions on tax and spending that we want to be monitored by an independent authority.</p> <p>They report.</p> <p>Government's decide.</p> <p>So there will be no more fiddling the figures, dodgy statistics, political motivations and machinations to mess around with taxpayers' money \u2013 just good, honest, responsible government.</p> <p>Second, we need strong, responsible and proper regulation of the financial systems that underpin our economy \u2013 another traditional role of the centre-right.</p> <p>I believe in markets that work \u2013 not in the assumption that laissez-faire is enough.</p> <p>As I argued back in March, \"the modern, globalised economy, created to a large extent by laissez-faire economics, demands more than laissez-faire economics for success in the future\u2026.Even a free-marketeer understands that economic liberalism alone is not enough.\"</p> <p>Free markets need rules and frameworks, to make sure they work in the public interest.</p> <p>We regulate utility companies \u2013 and there is a good reason.</p> <p>If they fail, our lights go out \u2013 so we've got to make sure they work.</p> <p>And it's why we need proper, responsible regulation of our banking industry too.</p> <p>Because of the central role that retail banks and building societies play in our economy, they are just like utilities \u2013 if they fail, our economic lights go out.</p> <p>So we need to improve the way our financial system is regulated.<br> For a start, we must ensure that the regulators have the capacity to do the job. </p> <p>For too long, City firms have been able to poach the best regulators. </p> <p>So we will ensure that we get more good staff at the FSA, paid for by an increased levy on the City, and introduce a system similar to the Shareholder Executive so that banks send their best people to the FSA on secondment.<br> But the changes we need to ensure financial responsibility run much deeper.</p> <p>We need radical plan to change our approach to debt.<br> We need to reverse the fundamental mistake made a decade ago that meant that the authorities took no view at all over the level of debt in the economy. That view has been central to the financial irresponsibility that allowed debt and asset prices to get out of control. So we will introduce a new Debt Responsibility Mechanism to ensure that this does not happen again. We will instruct the Bank of England to write regularly to the FSA, setting out its concerns about the sustainability of the level of debt in the economy. </p> <p>The FSA will then be obliged to take that view into account when setting the amount of capital individual banks must hold.<br> So if the level of debt is growing unsustainably, the Bank will instruct the FSA to ensure banks either slow their lending or put aside more capital. The Debt Responsibility Mechanism explicitly rejects the irresponsible attitude of the last ten years that we can just let rip on debt, and not care about the consequences.</p> <p>It will be a fundamental and far-reaching reform of monetary policy.</p> <p>If it had been in place over the last ten years we would not have seen taxpayers forced to recapitalise the banks \u2013 they would never have become so fragile in the first place.</p> <p>But real financial responsibility will not be achieved simply through rules - we need a cultural change on the part of bankers too.</p> <p>No longer must they think just that because they are abiding by all the rules, morality goes out the window. </p> <p>Instead, they must recognise the massive responsibility they have to our society. </p> <p>So just as important as setting the right regulation is introducing the right incentives to create the right culture.</p> <p>The problems we currently face have come about because, for the past decade, the incentives have been distorted. </p> <p>The Executives at the very top of our banks were paid according to the short-term profits they made, rather than the success of any long-term decisions they took. </p> <p>So we've got ask the right questions about whether bankers have too many incentives to increase leverage to increase their returns.</p> <p>Rating agencies were paid only if deals were done, so no wonder they gave out AAA ratings like they were going out of fashion. </p> <p>And banks lending people money for their houses securitised the mortgages in order to get rid of the risk. </p> <p>We could respond in two ways.</p> <p>We could write detailed codes and establish an army of enforcers.</p> <p>Or we could get the incentives right \u2013 to steer people in the right direction and then trust them to make their own decisions and live by the consequences.</p> <p>So we should consider requiring the initiator of a mortgage to retain more of an interest in that mortgage.</p> <p>We should ensure that the regulators take Executive compensation schemes into account when regulating institutional risk.</p> <p>And we should look at the way that rating agencies earn their fees, with more transparency and perhaps some relation to the performance of the securities they rate. </p> <p>All of these measures are about retaining the fundamental strength of the market \u2013 freedom \u2013 but endowing it with the fundamental value \u2013 responsibility \u2013 upon which it depends.</p> <p>Sound public finances by restoring fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>The right framework of rules and incentives in the financial markets so we restore financial responsibility. </p> <p>These are necessary if we are to repair our free-enterprise economy for the long-term.</p> <p>But there is a third requirement.</p> <p>A responsible party has to include rebalancing our economy.</p> <p>Over the past decade, seventy percent of our economic growth has come from just three things.</p> <p>From housing \u2013 which is now declining.</p> <p>From the financial sector \u2013 now in turmoil.</p> <p>And from government spending \u2013 now slowing.</p> <p>And in addition, much of the growth has been driven by immigration \u2013 an unsustainable basis when you consider the impact on public services and our national infrastructure.</p> <p>Unlike many other countries in Europe, we can't turn to a strong manufacturing base to provide export-led growth, because manufacturing has shrunk by more than a million jobs over the past decade.</p> <p>And we can't put our faith in the high-tech service sector \u2013 like in America \u2013 to drive growth, because we haven't created the right conditions for it to flourish sufficiently over the past decade.</p> <p>We've got to change this \u2013 and build an economy that is balanced and resilient. </p> <p>We have to broaden our economic base to include more science, more hi-tech services, more green technologies, more engineering and more high-value manufacturing, drawing upon a much wider range of industries, markets, people, towns and cities.</p> <p>And how will get there?</p> <p>We need a radical plan. </p> <p>We need to do far better in bringing into everyday use technologies that are still in laboratories\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and developing in the laboratory technologies that haven't even been thought of yet.</p> <p>We need to reconfigure our energy systems, wean our economy off its dependence on imported hydrocarbons and turn Britain into a world leader in green innovation and engineering.</p> <p>We need to decentralise our economy so the south doesn't overheat and instead every part of our country plays a significant part in our growth.</p> <p>This won't happen overnight. </p> <p>For a start, this means creating an economic framework that enables new businesses to flourish.</p> <p>That is why we are committed to cutting the headline rate of small business tax to 20p, paid for by abolishing complex reliefs. </p> <p>And that is why we have asked David Arculus, a leading businessman and former head of the Better Regulation Task Force, to head an independent task force examining ways in which a Conservative Government could cut red tape.</p> <p>In the weeks ahead, we must not let this Government make the mistake of thinking that the answer to this crisis is to tax and regulate small businesses even more heavily. </p> <p>But creating a balanced enterprise economy is not simply a matter of government<br>getting out of the way. </p> <p>As I have said many times before, while we must be aware of the limitations of Government, we should never be limited in our aspirations for Government. </p> <p>It is not enough for Government to get out of the way \u2013 they've got to get involved.</p> <p>Government must also do more to secure the skills, energy and transport infrastructure that will help create new jobs in new industries and new markets.</p> <p>That's why we have set out a radical agenda of supply side reform in the education system, to create more and better school places in every community. </p> <p>That's why we are committed to a bold series of environmental policies, from feed-in tariffs for microgeneration to unleashing a green coal revolution.</p> <p>That's why we have proposed a series of policies to make it easier for innovative start-up businesses to win government contracts.</p> <p>And that's why we have pledged to introduce a high speed rail system that will link cities across Britain and transform regional economies. </p> <p>This is the right vision, the right plan, and above all, the right ambition, to create a balanced economy that is built to last. </p> <p>Britain has incredible resources at its disposal.</p> <p>World beating companies.</p> <p>Some of the best, brightest and most creative minds. </p> <p>Universities that are envy of the planet.</p> <p>But as we look at the wreckage of our economy after ten years of irresponsible Government, it's clear that if we're going to make the most of those resources we need change \u2013 not more of the same.</p> <p>Gordon Brown is hoping that his whirlwind of summitry will mean that we will forget what has come before.</p> <p>Forget that he stripped the Bank of England of its powers to supervise the city.</p> <p>Forget he accelerated - how he actively encouraged - the risk taking culture in our banks.</p> <p>Forget that he promised - time and time again - that he had abolished boom and bust.</p> <p>Forget that \u2013 as we enter a downturn, where jobs, home and livelihoods will be lost \u2013 that he was the one who created this mess in the first place. </p> <p>But I won't forget \u2013 and the British people won't forget.</p> <p>A fire has engulfed the house that is our economy.</p> <p>Stopping the fire from spreading \u2013 averting an even deeper financial crisis - has required everyone \u2013 opposition included \u2013 to man the pumps.</p> <p>Now, no doubt, Labour will start to talk about emergency repairs.</p> <p>But this isn't good enough. It's time to construct a house that is genuinely built to last.</p> <p>And we will only build an economy that is strong and there to last if we\u2026</p> <p>\u2026apply the same philosophy as I have been advocating in the social sphere for the last three years\u2026</p> <p>\u2026the philosophy of responsibility.</p> <p>To repair the broken society, in the long-term, we need social responsibility.</p> <p>And to repair the broken economy, in the long-term, we need economic responsibility.</p> <p>That means\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible fiscal policy, bolstered by independent oversight\u2026</p> <p>\u2026a responsible financial policy, bolstered by a renewed role for the Bank of England\u2026</p> <p>\u2026and a responsible attitude to economic development, that fosters more balanced economic growth.</p> <p>And today, it's only the Conservative Party that is offering that change.</p>",
  "<p>Booms on the Irish border used to mean bombs, rockets and landmines exploding. Now they equate to something entirely different. </p> <p>Towns and cities on the northern side of the Irish frontier are enjoying rapid retail growth despite the credit crunch. Places once synonymous with terrorism, destruction and division such as Newry and Derry are benefiting from a mass influx of shoppers from the Irish Republic. The southern bargain hunters are driving up to 50 miles to stock up on food, drink and other goods that are substantially cheaper in Northern Ireland's sterling zone as opposed to the euro one of the republic. <br><br>The flow of cash into knock-down price shopping malls like the Quays or Buttercrane centre in Newry prompted Ireland's finance minister, Brian Lenihan, this week to partially blame Ireland's economic woes on the vast numbers of southern consumers shopping in Ulster. </p> <p>Striking a rather sour note, Lenihan warned that there had been a huge loss of revenue to the Irish exchequer because southern citizens were buying their weekly shopping across the border. That is why, Lenihan said, the Irish government had to impose higher taxes to maintain essential public services. This was the consequence of the republic's people buying in another state, he added.</p> <p>That reference to \"another state\" is quite telling, especially in the context of the current political stalemate in Stormont. The power-sharing executive has still not met since June, even though Northern Ireland faces the same problems as everyone else in the republic and Britain: rising fuel bills partly due to energy companies enjoying near monopoly status, a declining property market and the spectre of 1980s-style unemployment looming over the horizon. The northern airwaves are filled with disgruntled members of the public berating their political leaders for failing to act in unison during these turbulent times. </p> <p>The sticking point between the two largest parties - Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionists - remains the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland assembly. </p> <p>The DUP insists it will agree to the transfer of these powers from London to Belfast once there is \"community confidence\". Sinn F\u00e9in meanwhile claims the DUP is reneging on commitments agreed to in the 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/oct/17/northernireland.devolution1\">St Andrews agreement</a> about the assembly taking control of the police and the judiciary. </p> <p>On the surface the row appears somewhat superficial. Because the DUP has in principle agreed to the transfer while agreeing with Sinn F\u00e9in that one possible compromise is that the centrist Alliance party join the cabinet and take charge of a joint police-justice ministry. </p> <p>Behind this however lies a possible deeper reason for Sinn F\u00e9in's refusal to allow a full cabinet meeting to take place. </p> <p>There is increasing evidence of internal problems within mainstream republicanism, with grassroots members complaining that much of what the Adams-McGuinness leadership promised has not been delivered. There is a growing, if somewhat belated realisation among some of the republican rank and file that the Sinn F\u00e9in project of Irish unity by 2016 (the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising) is a complete illusion. </p> <p>If the Stormont coalition \u2013 a devolved administration still inside the UK \u2013 is no longer envisaged as a \"stepping stone\" towards fusion with the republic, then perhaps it would be better to be outside rather inside the devolved institutions, to be a party of protest and retain your old radical edge. </p> <p>This devolution-doomsday scenario is probably a far away prospect even for disillusioned Provos. There is no other game in town. Instead the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership is seeking to re-engage the British and Irish governments in the political process, which will entail urging Brian Cowen and Gordon Brown to apply joint pressure on the DUP to bend to Sinn F\u00e9in's will. </p> <p>The trouble with this strategy is that it belongs to another world that has long passed. The Cowen government in Dublin might issue statements urging the DUP to move on policing, now echoing Brown's plea for them to do the same during his last visit to Belfast. But the idea that two prime ministers currently engaged in an existential struggle to save their banking systems and stop their economies sliding into recession and mass unemployment are going to focus their energies to resolve the petty squabbles at Stormont is hopelessly naive. </p> <p>Lenihan's exasperation over his fellow citizens opting to shop in \"another state\" betrays the commonly held view of southern society that has welcomed the final fruits of the peace process but has little enthusiasm for paying the huge economic, social and political costs of absorbing the north. They don't say it too loud down in Dublin - they are often drowned out by the romantic republican ballads struck up in pubs just before closing time - but the Ireland's silent majority believes the north should already be at rest; neither they nor their political leaders in the D\u00e1il are going to expend most of their energy on the sectarian circus at Stormont. </p> <p>The parties up there are on their own. </p> <p><strong>\u2022 Henry McDonald's new book on Irish republicanism, Gunsmoke and Mirrors, will be published by Gill and Macmillan next month</strong></p>",

  "<p>Today, we leave John McCain's home turf. As it turned out, Sedona wasn't exactly McCain country. Far from the bastions of south-west conservatism like Phoenix, this town of 11,000 has become a prime New Age destination because of the \"vortexes\" - special areas of \"enhanced energy flow\" - that supposedly lie amidst the surrounding spectacular landscape of red rock formations. Spas, galleries, and crystal stores outnumber saloons and gun shops - and from all appearances, Obama voters outnumber those loyal to their not-quite-native son.</p> <p>Out in the countryside where McCain has one of his many homes, things were a little more rustic. But even there, the main business are wineries and RV parks, epitomizing the schizophrenic nature of a area whose white population seems evenly divided between working-class Old West and New Age.<br> It also turns out, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/16/uselections20081\">I wrote yesterday</a>, that McCain's \"ranch\" is really more of a \"vacation home,\" just like George W. Bush's Crawford spread. Earlier this month, in a cover story called \"Make-Believe Maverick,\" Rolling Stone's Tom Dickerson pointed out other similarities in the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/make_believe_maverick_the_real_john_mccain\">mythos that surrounds W. and McCain.</a> \"Both were born into positions of privilege against which they rebelled into mediocrity ... At each step, with the aid of their fathers' powerful friends, both failed upward. And both shed their skins as Episcopalian members of the Washington elite to build political careers as self-styled, ranch-inhabiting Westerners who pray to Jesus in their wives' evangelical churches.\"</p> <p>My favorite take on McCain as maverick (not) comes from <a href=\"http://prorev.com/2008/10/swampoodle-reort-mccain-mugwump-not.html\">my old friend Sam Smith, who writes</a>: \"Mavericks have been best described as cattle that drink upstream from the herd. No one's pissin' in their water.\" He tells the story of the real-life Texas rancher and politician Samuel Augustus Maverick, whose present-day descendants object to McCain's co-option of the term. In any case, Smith concludes, it's looking more and more like \"America will be sending this fake maverick to the feed lot.\"</p>",

  "<p>New strip, October 2008. Click to enlarge.</p> <p><strong>Keith Hackett's official answers:</strong><br><strong>1) </strong>Play on \u2013 but you may wish to take action against the attackers for dissent. The fact that the ball went forward is irrelevant. The law, often misunderstood, clearly states that the keeper must not touch the ball with his hands inside his own area after it has been <em>deliberately</em> kicked to him by a team-mate. <em>Thanks to Brian Greaney for the question</em>.<br><strong>2) </strong>Give the goal. The striker is right: this is a normal part of open play. <em>Thanks to Francis D'Souza for the question. </em><br><strong>3)</strong> Allow the game to proceed: there is limited action you can take during the game \u2013 but you should call the two captains together and make it very clear that their teams' actions will be reported to the authorities. The authorites, in this situation, would be likely to take significant action. As Vastariner mentions below, something like this happened in the 1982 World Cup in Spain when West Germany and Austria knew that a 1-0 win for the Germans would put them both through. West Germany duly went 1-0 up after 10 minutes, and the remaining 80 minutes were a non-contact farce. At the next World Cup, Fifa ensured final round kick-off times would all be simultaneous, which means that incidents like this are now exceptionally rare. <em>Eilif Gustafson wins the shirt for this question.</em> </p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.
