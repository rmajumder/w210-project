  "<p>It has been hailed as the most realistic screen depiction of the mafia ever made, a gritty affair with an almost documentary-like quality that has been tipped for Oscar glory after winning second prize at Cannes. But if the Italian film Gomorrah does pick up any Academy Awards, its director, Matteo Garrone, may be without a cast member or two to cheer him on. Since the movie opened in Italy, two have been arrested and a third is being investigated over allegations of real-life mafia involvement.</p> <p>To maximise realism, Garrone cast a number of locals from Naples's most crime-ridden suburbs in several roles. Bernardino Terracciano, 53, who plays Uncle Bernardino in the film, was seized on Saturday on suspicion of extorting protection money and having ties to the Casalesi clan, part of the Camorra mafia, which has terrorised small towns north of Naples this year in a campaign that culminated in the shooting of six African migrants on September 18.</p> <p>His arrest follows that of Giovanni Venosa, who plays another boss in the film and who was detained in July on suspicion of playing the same role in real life. A third actor plucked from the streets of Naples to play a hit man, who is seen in the film bursting into a sun-tanning parlour and opening fire, is being investigated for drug dealing, the Italian newspaper Il Giornale reported yesterday. </p> <p>Garrone has said he approached the film as if it were a \"war documentary\" where \"the director is invisible\" and which works \"on an emotional level, not a rational level\". He cast theatrical actors alongside known cinema stars like Toni Servillo, combining them with a handful of Neapolitans with little or no acting experience hired on the spot, a formula he used in an earlier film set outside Naples, L'Imbalsamatore, or The Embalmer. </p> <p>One actor in Gomorrah, a fruit and vegetable seller in real life who was cast as an aspiring mobster, made his first ever trip outside Naples to help promote the film in Cannes. After deciding to use Neapolitan dialect for the dialogue, Garrone then added subtitles in Italian for the film's domestic release. </p> <p>One murder scene filmed in a rough Naples neighbourhood was videoed by locals using mobile phones and circulated, prompting a police investigation. \"I met bosses who showed me that footage on their cell phones and told me that in addition to carrying out hits, from now on they would film them too,\" Garrone said. </p> <p>The mob has long provided a rich seam for filmmakers, and like mobsters around the world the Casalesi have been inspired by on-screen mafiosi, notably Al Pacino in Scarface. Walter Schiavone, a senior boss, gave an architect a video of the film and told him to build a replica of the villa in which Al Pacino is murdered by rivals. Now standing empty, the villa appears in Gomorrah.</p> <p>Terracciano's appearance in the film however marks a new trend for mobsters. No longer content to sit back and study celluloid gangsters like Pacino, suspected real life bosses are upping the ante by starring in the films themselves.</p> <p>To make Gomorrah, Garrone was happy to take tips from locals when he filmed in some of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in Naples. \"When we shot these scenes, they were always looking on\", he has said, \"providing advice and actively participating.\"</p> <p>Based on the best selling book by the Italian journalist Roberto Saviano, Gomorrah describes the vice-like grip of the Camorra on Naples through drug dealing, building contracts, prostitution and the dumping of toxic waste in fertile agricultural land, as well as control over the city's rubbish collection.</p> <p>Saviano, who is now under police protection, has continued to campaign against the rule of the Casalesi clan, the most feared grouping within the Camorra, which has this year launched a campaign of killings, prompting the dispatch this month of 400 extra police and 500 soldiers to the clan's fiefdom around Casal di Principe. Yet killings have continued, despite the arrest of suspected hit men.</p> <p>\"The plan has been to terrorise businessmen and family members of turncoats as well as discouraging future turncoats,\" one of those arrested, Oreste Spagnuolo, told police, Corriere della Sera reported yesterday. </p> <p>Despite the erection of army roadblocks and a wave of arrests, the Casalesi were suspected of last week ransacking the flat of a local journalist, Rosaria Capacchione, who has documented the clan's empire and who also lives under police escort.</p> <h2>Made men</h2> <p>Gomorrah is not the first time cast members have fallen foul of the law in real life. The Sopranos had a litany of cases in which actors were charged with criminal offences. In 2006 Louis Gross, cast as bodyguard to mob boss Tony Soprano, was charged with criminal mischief for an alleged break-in. He cut a deal with prosecutors. Another actor, Lillo Brancato Jr, goes on trial next month charged with the murder of an off-duty police officer in 2005. Vincent Pastore, \"Big Pussy\" Bonpensiero, pleaded guilty in 2005 to attempted assault on his girlfriend and was sentenced to community service. Robert Iler, Soprano's rebellious son, pleaded guilty in 2001 to mugging two youths and stealing $40; he got three years' probation. Tony Sirico, Paulie Walnuts, had before the series been arrested 28 times, and was sentenced to four years for holding up a nightclub in the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Caroline White</strong></p>",
  "<p>Three newsmen I respect have taken it upon themselves to absolve journalists of responsibility for the fall of newspapers. I must respectfully if bluntly disagree. Adrian Monck, the head of journalism at City University, opened the defence when he blogged (at bit.ly/monck): \"Declining newspaper readership has nothing to do with journalism ... The crops did not fail because we offended the gods.\" </p> <p>Paul Farhi of the Washington Post issued a resounding apologia for journalists in the American Journalism Review (at bit.ly/ajr), arguing: \"Newspapers are in trouble for reasons that have almost nothing to do with newspaper journalism and everything to do with the newspaper business.\" </p> <p>Then, in his Guardian blog (at theguardian.com/media/greenslade), Roy Greenslade leapt in with a ringing hear! hear! \"There cannot be any doubt that journalists themselves ... cannot be held responsible for either the financial woes of the industry nor for the public turning its back on the 'products' that contain their work ... They are blameless.\" They have \"no reason to feel guilty ... It isn't our fault ... The truth is that we are being assailed by revolutionary technological forces completely outside of our control ... You are not the cause of the current calamity.\" He doth protest too much. </p> <p>The fall of journalism is journalists' fault. It is our fault we did not see change coming soon enough and ready our craft for its transition. It is our fault we did not exploit - hell, too many resisted - the opportunities new media and new relationships with the public presented. It is our fault we lost readers and squandered trust. It is our fault we did not give adequate stewardship to journalism and left business to the business people. It is our fault we sat back and expected some princely patron to support us. </p> <p>Farhi makes the mistaken and common assumption that a newspaper is an immutable product. He acknowledges that papers should update their sites with Twitter, social networking, Google Maps and video. But he ignores the greater need and opportunity to rethink and reinvent journalism itself. The internet is not just a glittery gadget. It presents the circumstances to change our relationship with the public, to work collaboratively...#65279; in networks, to find new efficiencies thanks to the link, to rethink how we cover and present news. </p> <p>By maintaining the newsroom as a static entity, Farhi also retains the common and dangerous belief that its budget is thus fixed: it is what it is because it always has been. But a newsroom is inefficient and too many of its expenses are fuelled by ego. </p> <p>Finally, Farhi glosses over the state of journalism's relationship with its public. He brags that almost 50 million Americans still buy papers and so, he argues, readership is not the issue. But circulation is down more than 14% since 1970 while population has risen 50%. Penetration is roughly half what it was: a mere 17% v 30%. In the UK, daily national newspaper readership dropped 19% in 15 years. I'd say our relationship with readers is a problem. A Gallup survey says 52% of Americans do not trust news media, up from 30% in 1972. Who's responsible for that? My purpose in rebutting Farhi, Greenslade and Monck is not to flagellate journalists but to empower them. To take responsibility for the fall of journalism is to take responsibility for its fate. Who'll try to save it if not journalists? There's not a minute to waste whining. </p> <p>\u00b7 Jeff Jarvis is a journalism professor at the City University of New York and blogs at buzzmachine.com</p>",
  "<p>There are certain assumptions when it comes to junkets - and that you'll be flying easyJet isn't normally one of them. Clearly nobody had told Abta (the Association of British Travel Agents), which last week booked around 40 journalists who had been at their annual convention in Gran Canaria onto Stelios' finest. It's not quite the luxury many journalists have become accustomed to.</p> <p>Yet this wasn't a one-off. Press trips have traditionally been to earn what PR Week editor Danny Rodgers calls \"an incalculable amount of positive coverage and long-term goodwill\" - but companies have started to tighten their belts. </p> <p>Take Ford's recent overnight trip to Tuscany with 80 journalists and photographers to launch the new Fiesta. \"Five years ago, a press trip as important as this one would have lasted several days and would have involved perhaps 120 journalists going somewhere really exotic,\" admits Ford UK's PR manager, Fiona Pargeter. \"But in the new media landscape - in which a car review can be uploaded and appear within a day - no firm wants to spend more time and money than they need to.\"</p> <p>In consumer electronics, junkets are also being scaled back to some extent. \"Most people in gadget journalism have been on those trips where a whole pack of you are flown halfway round the world to inspect the electronics equivalent of a new ruler, but they're getting less frequent and far less crowded,\" says Michael Brook, editor of T3 magazine.</p> <p>There's also the question of what journalists are expected to do on these junkets. \"Rather than spending hours on the beach, as was once the case, factory visits tend to dominate the itinerary, and there is invariably a flurry of emails about what you are expected to cover before you are even allowed on the plane,\" says Brook.</p> <p>Daily Express show business editor, Elisa Roche, whose father, Tom, was a Fleet Street reporter, says today's junkets always come with strings attached. \"I can remember my dad going away for a week at a time and near enough forgetting where he'd been, but for me, no press trip is viable unless I know I can get a story out of it.\" And when it comes to the Oscars or Emmy awards, the Express foots the bills. </p> <p>Rogers says many firms now crave one-to-one deals with specific titles or journalists rather than the \"scatter-gun\" approach of the group trip. \"Targeted visits are becoming the order of the day as clients expect more control over their coverage and journalists want exclusive angles and stories.\"</p> <p>In travel journalism, where what tour operators like to call \"familiarisation\" trips are standard, the problem of PR-generated copy has led to a number of publications - including Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller and the FT - choosing to preserve editorial integrity by refusing all paid-for trips or by offering to share the cost of them with the organisers. \"The splitting it 50:50 thing is a logistical nightmare for us,\" says Frances Tuke, PR manager at Abta.</p> <p>The cost of flying is prompting many Caribbean-based property and travel companies to invite US journalists, rather than UK ones, to sample new products, says Charlotte Heath-Bullock, director of the PR firm Luchford APM. \"What's important is to have a relationship with the 'right journalists' for your particular market.\" </p> <p>But some companies are not holding back on the group press trip. In the past two years, Virgin Atlantic has hosted at least 12 three- to four-day trips to long-haul destinations such as Kenya, Jamaica and Dubai. And a trip to India is planned for this month.</p> <p>\"We take around 50 journalists representing a whole range of different national and trade titles,\" says director of communications Paul Charles. \"Our job is to ensure that every journalist gets their own exclusive story.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wired </strong><br>9pm, ITV1</p> <p>As vital to just-about-everything as high finance is, why should we invest in a drama set in a complex world full of unsympathetic characters, which, despite its import, just doesn't feel that dramatic? It's a question that Kate Brook's three-parter answers, not entirely unsuccessfully, by focusing on Louise (Jodie Whittaker), a banker/single mum newly promoted at work and immediately drawn into a scam run by Laurence Fox. When he's not brandishing a knife near a child (boo!), he appears to be engaging in a sneer-off with fraud cop Toby Stephens. A by-numbers thriller, obviously. </p> <p><strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall</strong><br>9pm, Channel 4</p> <p>Though Channel 4 has, for shame, all but abandoned new drama series, and the cynical among you may view its one-off films as exercises in nabbing Baftas and ticking boxes, there's no denying the power or punch of the likes of The Mark of Cain and Boy A. Similarly, Simon Block's take on the shooting of British peace activist Hurndall in Gaza in 2003, and his family's quest for answers, is compelling, urgent and solemn.

  "<p>I've never been a massive fan of Alastair Campbell. Not because of his bullying and warmongering - that can be quite endearing in a man. But there's just something so utterly charmless about him. I've always thought of him as being like a cold wind: someone who can, I imagine, suck the warmth out of a room, simply by being in it.</p> <p>In <strong>Cracking Up</strong> (BBC2, Sunday), though, we see another side to him. This is his film about his depression and the breakdown he had. What a breakdown it was, too. There weren't just voices in his head, there were brass bands and entire orchestras. Men were following him, others testing him. Road signs and adverts contained coded personal messages, colours took on a sinister significance. He was sure he was going to die. Campbell ended up naked in a police cell, and then hospitalised - bewildered, isolated, paranoid.</p> <p>It was a spectacular and terrifying fall, into a deep dark chasm - from which he clambered back, obviously, to bully and to warmonger, and to be in Tony's gang. But ever since he has suffered bouts of severe depression. </p> <p>Here he talks about it all with incredible honesty, and a refreshing matter-of-factness. That has to be applauded. He's doing his bit - a considerable bit - to remove the fog of fear and hush that surrounds mental illness. </p> <p>There's no better way to humanise someone than through a bit of openness and honesty. A chink in the armour helps, too, and in Campbell's case it isn't a chink, it's a bloody great gaping hole. Oh, and the other thing that makes Campbell less odious, of course, is that he is no longer in a position of such power that he can seriously affect our lives.</p> <p>Anyway, he's also very good - surprisingly good - at describing it all. I especially like the way he talks about his recovery. He took each day as Geoff Boycott (Campbell's favourite batsman) would face a delivery. Nothing fancy, no heavy hitting or lashing out. Just steady, methodical and safe - one at a time, batting them back, counting them off. Staying in. </p> <p>He even smiles, laughs a couple of times, too, in this film. Could it be that it's genuine laughter, not sneery and mocking? Are we going to have to rethink Campbell completely? That would be overdoing it. \"I think I'm highly lovable,\" he says at one point. No, Alastair, you're not. But it is possible that you are human, after all. </p> <p>If Simon Schama's American programme on a Friday night is just a bit too brainy for you, here's <strong>Stephen Fry in America</strong> (BBC1, Sunday). Not that this is America for thickies, it's just that in with the history, there are lobsters and ice-cream, hunting trips, and huge dollops of creamy English charm, which of course they just love over there. </p> <p>What's nice about it is that he doesn't do the usual British thing, which is to sneer at Americans for not knowing about the rest of the world, and for being fat and stupid. This is more of a celebration of the States. They love him, he loves them. And if there is just the tiniest hint of mockery, it's so gentle that the mockees wouldn't know it was happening, and even if they did, they'd probably enjoy it. </p> <p>Stephen Fry is driving a black London cab (as he does at home) through every single state, slowly working his way west. He stops off at the Ben &amp; Jerry's factory to invent a new flavour, goes deer shooting in the woods with a bunch of rednecks - though Stephen doesn't want to kill the deer (he's less squeamish about the lobsters, which are plunged, live, into boiling water for lunch). Happily, there are no deer today - maybe they heard him coming. He goes for a sail on a beautiful yacht, gets a tour of a nuclear submarine, takes a steam train up a mountain, and has tea and a chat with a black, gay, Republican Baptist. He meets an Englishman in New York, the one who once sang a song on that very subject, and gives him a ride, presumably so he can say he once had that Sting in the back of his cab. </p> <p>This is travel booked through Michael Palin Tours, more charming than purposeful. I'm not really sure if I'm learning anything. Who cares, though - there's Schama on a Friday for that. This is just a jolly road trip, very jolly, for a Sunday night.</p>",
  "<p>'Have a cannoli,\" says Cyndi Lauper, pushing a bakery box across the coffee table. She's about to eat one of the cheese-filled, ruinously calorific Italian pastries. \"Here, eat it from the box - you never know who's been on the table.\" </p> <p>It's hard to imagine Madonna making such a gesture, let alone watching approvingly as the cannoli is swallowed. It may be unfair to still be comparing Lauper to Madonna 25 years after the pop rivalry that resulted in the arguably more talented Lauper being relegated to runner-up, but the similarities make it hard to avoid. Both are Italian-American Catholics whose personalities engulf their music; both are in their third decade in a business that often measures a career in months; and both have influenced subsequent generations of singers. Gwen Stefani and Alison Goldfrapp certainly seem to have taken Lauper's full-colour kookiness as their model.</p> <p>There is also a new point of comparison: Lauper's first album of new material since 1997, Bring Ya to the Brink, is a back-to-the-disco record that has things in common (including the use of hip young producers) with Madonna's recent return to her early 1980s sound. The difference is that the crackling Bring Ya to the Brink sounds like it was made not with platinum discs in mind but to sate Lauper's massive appetite for musical experimentation. That's just as well; its first single, Into the Nightlife, sold well, but the album, despite thrilling the critics, hasn't had the same success. Is she bothered? Well, one of her favourite expressions is \"I don't give a hoot!\", and she does seem to mean it.</p> <p>\"David and Declyn,\" she says, referring to her husband and son, \"have said to me that they wish I had Madonna's business sense. I don't have good business sense. You never get much money for the arts. But I like independence. I like to grow.\" As an artist - a word she much prefers to singer, since she's also a producer, video director, occasional actor and organiser of True Colors, a multi-band outfit that travels America with a human-rights message - she's grown significantly since her 1984 signature hit, Girls Just Want to Have Fun. Although she was never again so in tune with the zeitgeist as she was then, dressed in those thrift-shop petticoats and urging girls to fight for their right to party, she has done far more interesting things since. </p> <p>There have been, among her 12 albums, a bravely sparse acoustic adventure, a covers set that reinvented standards such as Walk On By, a self-written Christmas collection and now this new disco record, which was co-produced by youths so screamingly hip they don't mind being known as The Scumfrog and Digital Dog. (The better-known Basement Jaxx also figure.) \"My music is about a joyful experience,\" she says. \"I've learned that if you can affect other people, you should. I'm not gonna worry about what people think about me. I'm too busy. I don't give a hoot.\"</p> <p>There's a lullaby sweetness to her speaking voice that contrasts markedly with both her powerhouse singing style and the New York accent that coats every word. Years ago, as a guest on Terry Wogan's TV show, she was ribbed by Wogan about the accent and, supremely straight-faced, told him: \"Most people think I'm cockney.\" It transpires that she was being serious. \"People do say I sound English sometimes,\" she says. \"At home, sometimes they say that.\" Home is still New York, where they clearly have a novel perception of the English accent. </p> <p>But maybe I've misunderstood: Lauper's thoughts aren't always easy to follow, sometimes emerging as a stream of images that don't bear much relation to the question she's meant to be answering. Asked how she'd hooked up with Basement Jaxx, who co-wrote the album's fabulously spaced-out track Rocking Chair, she instead tells a story about taking the Eurostar to London from Paris. \"The train goes under the water, so you don't see the white cliffs of Dover! When we went through the tunnel, I was sitting there, quietly singing The White Cliffs of Dover to myself.\" She then describes what she'd been wearing on the train - lots of enveloping layers and a fedora - and then sighs, saying: \"When you're young and walk down the street and look eccentric, that's cute. But when you're older, they're scared of you. Get to the other side of the street! The difference between the way you look and the way you think you look! I thought I looked like Greta Garbo.\"</p> <p>There's nothing eccentric about her appearance today. She's downright glamorous: stylishly angular platinum hair, black jeans, black sweater and fierce, high-heeled black boots. She looks years younger than 55, and is very pleased when I say so. \"Ageism? There's ageism in everything. I don't give a hoot. It isn't what other people think; it's what you think. But it's hard to come to terms with getting older. I admire people like Vivienne Westwood.\" And Madonna? \"She's fantastic. She's like Wonder Woman.\"</p> <p>She's keen to discuss Bring Ya to the Brink, written and recorded in Europe. \"I wanted to experience writing in a different place. I never went to Europe to write before. I didn't go as a famous person, I went as a writer and stayed at a hole-in-the-wall hotel in Chelsea, and I could come and go without being noticed. I went to Brixton [to work with Basement Jaxx] and that was so great.\" </p> <p>Despite having sold around 25m records - including one, Girls Just Want to Have Fun, that's considered the definitive pop moment of its year, if not the early 1980s - Lauper doesn't relish the limelight, and worries about its effect on Declyn, 10. \"He was two when he first realised I was famous,\" she says. \"It's hard for him. People look at him, and he feels the pressure of being my son. Someone came up to me in the street and kept talking and talking. Declyn said afterwards, 'Who are you?' And I said, 'I'm a mommy.' And he said, 'No, you're not - you're Cyndi Lauper!'\" She searches through her handbag and pulls out photos of a long-haired little boy wearing a hockey mask. She laughs: \"I'm a hockey mom.\"</p> <p>This leads to a brief discussion of the moment's other renowned hockey mom, Sarah Palin, for whom Lauper has mixed feelings: \"She gives a good soundbite. It's great McCain picked a woman, but it's sad he picked one who's unqualified.\" On her blog, she has reproduced an essay by Gloria Steinem, the US feminist icon, that rues the choice of Palin, and the site provides a link to register to vote. On her True Colors tour this summer, she banged home this same message, telling audiences: \"It's more important to vote for the American president than the American Idol.\"</p> <p>You don't do a bad soundbite yourself, I say. She looks dubious, as if I've insulted her, then decides no offence was intended. She's a sensitive person, she says, who's always felt herself an outsider, \"and not through choice. I've always been the outsider looking in.\" So the title of her multi-platinum 1983 debut album, She's So Unusual, was apt? \"It wasn't a joke,\" she says.</p> <p>The back cover of Bring Ya to the Brink shows Lauper standing outside a suburban house, gazing into a window. This photo, inspired by a painting she did while studying art as a teenager in Vermont, has only one interpretation: exclusion. Despite the professional success, the 17-year marriage to Law &amp; Order actor David Thornton, and the warm reviews that greeted Bring Ya to the Brink, she still sees herself as the odd one out. Not that she's bothered. </p> <p>\"Do people know who I really am, what I really do?\" she says. \"No. Do I care? No\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Cyndi Lauper </strong>plays Shepherds Bush Empire, London W1 (0870 771 2000), tomorrow. Then touring. <strong>Bring Ya to the Brink</strong> is out now</p>",
  "<p>Iceland's authorities last night appeared close to agreeing a repayment package to help cover the losses of British savers with deposits in Icesave, the UK operation of one of the country's stricken banks.</p> <p>Officials from the Treasury, Bank of England and FSA flew back from Reykjavik yesterday having made \"significant progress\" in talks with banks and government officials aimed at securing a rapid payout for British depositors. </p> <p>However, the deal does not yet include the billions of pounds invested by councils, charities and other public bodies. </p> <p>The Icelandic government took control of three of the country's largest banks last week and froze deposits, including an estimated \u00a34.5bn from British savers.</p> <p>The UK government has used anti-terror laws to seize an estimated \u00a34bn in Icelandic resources, and ministers said yesterday these will not be released until a deal has been struck.</p> <p>Iceland had originally guaranteed the first \u00a316,000 of savings, and if it meets this obligation on British deposits in all its stricken banks, it could cost Iceland's taxpayers \u00a32.2bn. A further \u00a334,000 has been guaranteed by the British government.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman said the talks in Iceland had been conducted in \"a friendly atmosphere\" and arrangements had been \"agreed in principle for an accelerated payout to depositors\".</p> <p>Last week, Gordon Brown said Iceland's refusal to guarantee British savings was \"totally unacceptable and illegal\". On Saturday, the Dutch government secured a commitment from Iceland to pay out to its savers using a different tactic. It has offered to loan Iceland the money.</p> <p>The Treasury this week hopes to continue talks to forge a similar agreement to help wholesale investors, including councils, charities and universities with frozen deposits in the Icelandic banks.</p> <p>This weekend, councils' exposure rose towards \u00a31bn, and the Open University said it had invested \u00a36.5m in Heritable and Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander. An estimated ten universities have deposits in Iceland running to tens of millions of pounds, it was reported yesterday.</p> <p>The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, has asked ministers to allow councils to keep, temporarily, \u00a31bn in business rates they are due to pay the Treasury this week. That would help councils continue to carry out essential services, the LGA said. The chairwoman of the LGA, Margaret Eaton, will also meet the Icelandic ambassador to the UK \"to push the case of the British council-tax payer and ensure they are top of the list when the refunds come,\" a spokeswoman said. The LGA insists councils, such as Kent, which deposited \u00a350m in Icelandic banks, had invested prudently.</p> <p>Over the weekend, dozens more small charities reported potential losses from the Icelandic crisis ranging from \u00a325,000 to \u00a375,000, according to Stephen Bubb, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations. Estimates of the threat to good causes continued to vary from \u00a3125m to \u00a31bn.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Bubb will meet Liam Byrne, the cabinet office minister, to demand a two-pronged rescue package.</p> <p>\"The government has to do something to cover the Icelandic deposits and they cannot ignore the charitable sector,\" said Bubb. \"We will also call for a \u00a3500m emergency fund to support charities which are close to the edge and those which are facing a huge rise in demand for their services. </p> <p>\"One charity, the Elizabeth Finn Trust, which provides a service for people in financial crisis, saw applications rise 400% in the last four months it recorded compared to the same time last year.\"</p>",

The Hyundai was taken away by a recovery lorry, but police said the Ford could not be removed because it was so badly damaged.

Its latest Digital Music Survey, now in its fifth year, suggests that the industry should use growing opportunities to make money out of music online to make up for a long-term decline in CD sales.</p> <p>\"Despite the ubiquity of free music, there's a real willingness by consumers to pay for music products if the package is right,\" said Alexander Ross, music partner at the media law firm Wiggin, which co-authored the study. The optimistic verdict contrasts with last year's survey, which warned that illegal downloading was at an all-time high and set to rise further.</p> <p>The survey - a poll of 1,500 British consumers - found that online piracy fell by 10% this year, attributing this partly to more aggressive noises from internet service providers, which agreed this year to send warning letters to customers suspected of illegal file sharing.</p> <p>The report also pointed to the popularity of music videos on YouTube as a further reason for optimism. YouTube plans to develop e-commerce opportunities that would allow people to buy music directly after viewing videos.</p> <p>\"The music video is now more influential than ever and has become the industry's trump card for engaging consumers and creating that long-term emotional connection required for monetisation,\" said Russell Hart, chief executive of Entertainment Media Research. \"It is now the vital component in music marketing.\"</p>",
  "<p>The biggest ever sale of oil assets will take place today, when the Iraqi government puts 40bn barrels of recoverable reserves up for offer in London.</p> <p>BP, Shell and ExxonMobil are all expected to attend a meeting at the Park Lane Hotel in Mayfair with the Iraqi oil minister, Hussein al-Shahristani.</p> <p>Access is being given to eight fields, representing about 40% of the Middle Eastern nation's reserves, at a time when the country remains under occupation by US and British forces.</p> <p>Two smaller agreements have already been signed with Shell and the China National Petroleum Corporation, but today's sale will ignite arguments over whether the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a \"war for oil\" that is now to be consummated by western multinationals seizing control of strategic Iraqi reserves.</p> <p>Al-Shahristani is expected to reveal some kind of \"risk service agreements\" that could run for up to 20 years, with formal offers to be submitted by next spring and agreements signed in the summer.</p> <p>Gregg Muttitt, from the UK-based social and ecological justice group Platform, says he is alarmed that the government is pushing ahead with its plans without the support of many in Iraq.</p> <p>\"Most of the terms of what is being offered have not been disclosed. There are security, political and reputational risks here for oil companies but none of them will want to see one of their competitors gain an advantage,\" he said.</p> <p>Heinrich Matthee, a senior Middle East analyst at the specialist risk consultant Control Risks Group, also believes there are many pitfalls for those considering whether to make an offer.</p> <p>\"Currently it is unclear which party in Iraq is authorised to award a contract and at the same time to deliver its side of the bargain,\" he said. \"Any contract with an independent oil company will be subjected to opposition and possible revision after pressure by resource nationalists.\"</p> <p>Oil companies will find their reputations at risk from the actions of their Iraqi counterparties, such as joint venture partners, suppliers and agents. They will also have to contend with oil smuggling and the possibility that the ruling alliance could collapse, Matthee said. </p> <p>He said that if the conspiracy theory that western oil companies egged on US and British governments to invade Iraq were true, the plan could backfire on them and benefit rivals in Asia instead. \"It is possible the American army has provided the economic stability that will encourage Malaysian, Chinese and other Asian companies to become involved,\" he said. </p> <p>There is no precedent for proven oil reserves of this magnitude being offered up for sale, said Muttitt. \"The nearest thing would be the post-Soviet sale of the Kashagan field [in the Caspian Sea], which had 7bn or 8bn barrels.\"</p> <p>China's state-owned oil group, CNPC, has already agreed a $3bn (\u00a31.78bn) oil services contract with the government of Iraq to pump oil from the Ahdab oil field.</p> <p>The deal is the first major oil contract with a foreign firm since the US-led war and was followed up by an agreement with Shell, potentially worth $4bn, to develop a joint venture with the South Gas Company in Basra. </p> <p>This deal has also triggered controversy. Issam al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister between 1987 and 1990, questioned why there had been no competitive tendering for the gas-gathering contract and claimed it had gone to Shell as the spoils of war. </p> <p>\"Why choose Shell when you could have chosen ExxonMobil, Chevron, BG or Gazprom?\" he asked. \"Shell appears to be paying $4bn to get hold of assets that in 20 years could be worth $40bn. Iraq is giving away half its gas wealth and yet this work could have been done by Iraq itself.\" </p> <p>The Baghdad government says it aims to increase crude oil production from 2.5m barrels a day to 4.5m by 2013, but faces internal opposition from regional governors and political opponents.</p> <p>The sale today comes as oil prices have plummeted after stockmarket turmoil on Friday. The price of crude fell by more than $4 at one point to $75 a barrel - the lowest point since September last year and a sharp drop from its peak of $147 in July. Opec, the oil producers' cartel, has called an emergency meeting to agree a cut in output to bolster prices in spite of protestations from politicians including Gordon Brown. Brown said on Friday: \"We've had some success in getting the price of oil down: the price this morning is roughly $80, about half what it was a few months ago. I want these price cuts passed on to the consumer as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\"I'm concerned when I hear that the Opec countries are meeting, or are about to meet, to discuss cutting production - in other words, making the price potentially higher than it should be. </p> <p>\"I'm making it clear to Opec it would be wrong for the world economy and wrong for British people who are paying high petrol prices and high fuel prices to cut production and therefore keep prices high.\"</p> <p>A government source said: \"The one chink of light has been the fall in the price of oil. The last thing we want is to head into a difficult period with a return to high oil prices. People need to act responsibly.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gloucester's director of rugby, Dean Ryan, could not stop grinning, despite a dour 80 minutes which emphasised again how the experimental law variations are stifling initiative and counter-attacking play.</p> <p>Winning ugly has not been a feature of Ryan's side, with key matches invariably ending in defeat, but the chokers turned stranglers in a performance high on discipline rather than daring.</p> <p>The fly-half Ryan Lamb summed up Gloucester's new approach, which has been partly forced on them by the ELVs. There were times when he received a kick in his own territory and, initially trusting his instinct, looked to run and counter. Then he remembered Ryan's game plan and put his boot to the ball to peg back Biarritz.</p> <p>There were more than 70 kicks out of hand: it was hard to keep count as neither side dared keep the ball in hand in their own half. Territory was king and Gloucester were aided by a generous penalty count in their favour, 17-6, which allowed them to kick deep and, usually, win the resulting lineout.</p> <p>The referee Peter Allan infuriated Biarritz not so much with his interpretation of the tackle and ruck laws, but with what the French side saw as inconsistency. \"The better side won, but the referee cost us a bonus point,\" said the Biarritz coach, John Isaac. \"He blew us for certain things, but not them. I am in need of some answers.\"</p> <p>When Gloucester stole Biarritz's ruck ball by illegal use of a hand, they kicked upfield and forced a lineout five yards out. Beno\u00eet August overthrew and Luke Narraway caught the ball, only to knock on with the line at his mercy. Allan waved play on and, as some Biarritz players stopped, James Simpson-Daniel enjoyed a two-man overlap to score.</p> <p>Lamb's more muted role at No10 emphasises the new Gloucester, who have worked hard on their set-pieces. Olly Barkley, at inside-centre officially, often played first receiver, although he twice, unforgivably, forgot that kicking directly to touch after receiving a pass from outside his 22 now gains no territory.</p> <p>Biarritz scored a well-worked try through the wing Jean-Baptiste Gobelet, but they lacked position through the high penalty count against them and Gloucester's refusal to move the ball in their own half. \"This was a big step for us,\" said Ryan. \"We did not try and overplay.\"</p> <p>Ryan singled out Lamb and Iain Balshaw as \"flamboyant\" players who had reined themselves in for the cause, which is hardly something for the game to celebrate. The gains of recent years, in terms of attacking intent, are being sacrificed for a whim. Does anyone care?

  "<p>With all the publicity being given to the fight against the egregious 42-day detention clause, I am worried that another questionable part of the bill will not get the thrashing it deserves. Clauses of the counterterrorism bill dealing with inquests come up for debate in the Lords on Thursday. The government's proposals are ill-thought-out, unnecessary, an overreaction, open to abuse and capable of creating injustice. </p> <p>The main objection is to clause 77, which would give a home secretary the power to order that an inquest be held without a jury if he or she believes that evidence given should not be made public \"a) in the interests of national security, b) in the interests of the relationship between the UK and another country, or c) otherwise in the public interest\". For instance, a home secretary could decide that an inquest into the death of a British soldier killed by friendly fire be held without a jury, because the evidence disclosed might make the US cross with the UK; or that it was against the public interest for us to know about the police's behaviour when they killed Jean Charles de Menezes. There are circumstances in which sensitive information ought not to be made public; but the government's plan is overkill, gives the home secretary too much power and greatly reduces the public's right to know the truth about suspicious and controversial deaths. </p> <p>I don't blame Iceland's prime minister for coming to the angry conclusion that the UK government had frozen Icelandic assets here by using a law meant to combat terrorism. The real culprit is the British habit of cramming lots of subjects into one act of parliament. The Icelandic freezing was done under the 2001 Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act, but not under that part of it which dealt with terrorism. Section 4 says that if the Treasury reasonably believes that someone is taking action to the detriment of the UK's economy, the assets of that person (which includes a bank or a government) can be frozen. Nothing to do with terrorism; and there are several other bits of the act similarly free from a terrorism link. Perhaps this will be a lesson to whoever makes up the titles of statutes. If it had been called the We Can Freeze Your Assets Act, Reykjavik could have had no complaint. </p> <p>I'm pleased to see the Judicial Appointments Commission using papal precedents to announce new judges. A pope occasionally appoints a cardinal in pectore - in the breast, or heart. His name is not revealed, for fear that the country in which he operates might make life more difficult for him or the church. The JAC has announced the appointment of three women high court judges - which would bring the total to an admirable 17 (from 11 earlier this year) - but won't say who they are, on the grounds that the vacancies they are to fill have not yet occurred. I do hope their identities are disclosed sooner than those of the cardinals, whose names may not be made public for many years, and sometimes not in their lifetimes.</p>",
  "<p>Today sees the return to the House of Lords of the contentious issue of extending to 42 days the time someone can be held by the police without being charged. I would have wanted to take part in the debate, though unavoidably I will be absent overseas. My view is that this pernicious provision should be removed from this bill now. </p> <p>I regard it as not only unnecessary but also counterproductive; and we should fight to protect the liberties the terrorists would take from us, not destroy them ourselves. This proposal is wrong in principle and dangerous in practice.</p> <p>During my time as attorney general I studied the issue of how long suspects can be held before being charged, and was closely involved with a number of the terrorist plots with which the bill is designed to deal. I had been a solitary voice in government in questioning 90 days. I am confident that it is a wrong-headed and dangerous approach to extend still further the time for pre-trial detention.</p> <p>It is now hard to find anyone outside the ranks of government who regards this as a sensible proposal. It has been rejected by two former directors of MI5; the experience of prosecutors is that 28 days is sufficient; it has been condemned by former attorneys general, lord chancellors and senior police officers. In the House of Lords, eminent speaker after speaker spoke against it, cataloguing its faults and dangers. It is unnecessary, unworkable, a constitutional muddle and an easy propaganda coup for the extremist radicalisers.</p> <p>There is now no public support from the police. Last week former assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, one of the most senior officers to have dealt with anti-terrorism and one of the original proponents of the 90-day plan, revealed that the police do not support the proposal. He says that it is unworkable because of the procedures the government had to put in place to buy support in the Commons.</p> <p>It is particularly unfortunate that a Labour government has been so committed to this. There are other things that would improve our prospects of prosecuting and convicting terrorists and on which we could better spend energy and time: in particular, to allow prosecutors to use evidence from eavesdropped communications.</p> <p>Among our allies, we alone do not allow intercept evidence (though Britain does allow it if the interception was by someone other than our own state agencies). Of course, if this were to be allowed, there would have to be safeguards to protect secret sources of information. But there is, I believe, a way of doing this. If only the government had used the effort it has spent on trying to force 42 days past sceptical and unwilling parliamentarians, on polishing the plans to allow intercept into evidence, we would be making a really useful contribution to tackling terrorism.</p> <p>I too want to support the party and its leadership. But in the long run, Labour's reputation for decent values will be seriously tarnished if we force through an unnecessary and draconian restriction on liberty.</p> <p>The timing of this vote is especially telling. Both presidential candidates in the US have said that they will shut Guant\u00e1namo Bay. We are about to see some of the most visible and wrong practices of the \"war on terror\" come to an end. So, right at the moment that the US would be turning decisively against such draconian anti-terrorist laws, a Labour government could have the shameful distinction of being the last to enact a reviled piece of law that undermines the fundamental values of our society. Forty-two days should be consigned decisively to the bin. The house has the chance to do that today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lord Goldsmith QC was attorney general from 2001 to 2007 <a href=\"mailto:goldsmithp@parliament.uk\">goldsmithp@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>\"You find yourself approaching middle age, playing another scuzzy rock club ... I'm still playing places for kids,\" Juliana Hatfield said in August. In that case, the quilted interior of the half-full Queen Elizabeth Hall must be balm to her soul. There's even a vase of flowers on a side table next to the microphone.</p> <p>It's been years since the Boston songwriter wielded the kind of clout that had music magazines putting her on the cover and Jeff Buckley touring as her opening act, but she has never stopped making albums. There's a new one, How to Walk Away, but this show is pegged to the publication of her autobiography, When I Grow Up. It's a gig of two halves: in the first, Hatfield reads extracts and sings acoustically; later, she returns with a plugged-in band and delves into her back catalogue.</p> <p>The first half is the more engaging by a long way. Contrary to what you might expect from this wan, Winehouse-skinny woman, Hatfield has written a cracking story about her life as a leading member of Boston's 1990s alt-rock scene. She reads expressionlessly, her sweep of shiny hair hiding her face, but the content is fascinating. She falls for a junkie, plays clubs so wretched the backstage \"toilet\" is a plastic cup, is traumatised by her mother's affair with a rock star - all of which repeatedly underscores the fact that Hatfield doesn't think much of herself. Accompanying acoustic numbers such as Tourist are frail and bruised.</p> <p>The all-music second half is anticlimactic. Though there are joyous squeals when she plays the near-hits My Sister and Your Way Or the Highway, she's hampered by her wafer-thin voice and propensity for fading into the background at her own gig. A clear case for giving up the day job and starting afresh as an author.</p>",

But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it. We will renegotiate until an agreement is reached, but that does not mean we will compromise for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>Mugabe gazetted the appointment of new cabinet posts at the weekend, allocating his party control over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which controls Zimbabwe's highly partisan state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\" and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit to unblock the logjam over the distribution of ministries. \"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" Tsvangirai's party said.</p> <p>The MDC says it will agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military, but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But his position remains weak. There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million percent, but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power-sharing government. </p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration had no solutions to the economic crisis. While he can block implementation of the deal and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the agreement. </p> <p>Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Motlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing will inside the new government to confront Zimbabwe's leader.</p>",
  "<p>More than 60 Taliban fighters were killed yesterday as hundreds of insurgents tried to launch a surprise attack on Afghan forces in Lashkar Gah, capital of Helmand province. A convoy armed with mortar weapons was bombed by Nato aircraft as it began an assault on the outskirts of the city early yesterday morning.</p> <p>Daud Ahmadi, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said the fighters had attacked the city of Lashkar Gah from three sides but were pushed back after a battle involving airstrikes. Rockets landed in various parts of the city but there were no civilian casualties, he said. He added that Nato reported \"multiple enemy forces\" killed but had had no reports of casualties for its own organisation.</p> <p>The death toll yesterday - in the province which is the British troops' base in Afghanistan - could not be verified independently.</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said British forces had \"supported\" Afghan allies in the attack but would not say if the troops had fought alongside the Afghan army. It is thought British forces could have provided intelligence on the Taliban action. </p> <p>The US commander General David McKiernan, head of the Nato-led force in Afghanistan, said that hundreds of fighters had gathered for the attack. Brigadier General Richard Blanchette, spokesman for the International Security Assistance Force, said: \"If the insurgents planned a spectacular attack prior to the winter, this was a spectacular failure.\"</p> <p>Authorities recovered the bodies of 41 Taliban fighters on the city's outskirts, from where the attack began, Ahmadi said. He added that another 20 dead fighters were carried away by militants.</p> <p>Taliban fighters traditionally have relied more on suicide bombings and roadside bombs in their campaign in Helmand. If yesterday's attack represented a departure from the insurgents' usual tactics it was one that had \"failed miserably\", the MoD spokesman commented. Afghan officials also said yesterday that troops had retaken the Nad Ali district of Helmand. Ahmadi said the three-day fight ended Saturday and that Afghan security forces were in control of the district centre. </p> <p>Helmand is the largest drug-producing area in the world and the region alone accounts for more than half of Afghanistan's opium poppy production. More than 90% of the world's opium is produced in Afghanistan and up to $100m (nearly \u00a359m) of the trade's profits are used to finance the Taliban insurgency.</p> <p>Yesterday a roadside bomb reportedly struck a civilian vehicle in the Shamulzai district of Zabul, killing five people.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing that strikes you about Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's writing room is how clean it is. There are a few Star Wars action figures and the odd movie poster but mainly it's white walls and untouched carpet - which seems a little inappropriate for the nation's greatest on-screen slobs. \"It's just been decorated,\" says Pegg defensively. \"And we're married men now,\" adds Frost.</p> <p>It may also be because the duo are just too busy to make a mess. With How to Lose Friends still pulling in the punters at the cinema, and two movies going into production next year - their road movie, Paul, and the third in Pegg and director Edgar Wright's blood-and-ice-cream trilogy, The World's End - Pegg has decided this would be a good time to return to the small screen, writing and producing Life and Other Distractions - a 13-part comedy drama for Channel 4.</p> <p>\"These days, if you want to be a film actor you have to be careful with TV because it's that old thing - if people see you all the time on TV they're not keen to pay to see you at the cinema,\" he explains. \"That doesn't mean I don't love TV. This idea really appealed.\" </p> <p>The show will be a light drama about a family aimed at younger viewers, Pegg says. \"My involvement will be limited but I want to be a showrunner and have script control. I was interested in that age group, having grown up with shows like Grange Hill, and I wanted to do something outside my comfort zone. It's more kitchen sink than my usual stuff - having said that, any episodes I write will probably involve aliens and monsters.\"</p> <p>Pegg's ambitions reflect those of Big Talk, the company behind all his ideas since the 1999 sitcom Spaced. It has just sold a 25% stake to the BBC's distribution arm BBC Worldwide - which has been charged with seeking massive commercial expansion - and has recruited senior executives from across the industry. Kenton Allen, the BBC's former creative head of comedy, who has the Royle Family and Ideal on his CV, joins as joint chief executive; Luke Alkin, C4's ex-head of drama commissioning, is on board as executive producer for drama; and Skins producer Chloe Moss is drama development producer - all following Matthew Justice, who left Lunar Films to become Big Talk's managing director. </p> <p>The hope is that Big Talk will be able to develop movies, dramas and TV comedies with guaranteed global distribution through the Worldwide deal and a tight relationship with Working Title - which has funded all of Pegg's previous movies.</p> <p>With so much in development, Big Talk has had to expand, says its founder and chief executive, Nira Park.\"We've just signed a deal with Film 4, we have 18 films in development, we have drama in development with Channel 4, three films with Working Title and there was just me, Simon, Nick, Edgar and our head of production,\" Park says. \"We needed other people and people similar to us.\"</p> <p>At the same time, however, Allen's move from broadcaster to indie reflects a trend across the industry. ITV's controller of drama, Andy Harries, Michele Buck, controller of ITV productions, and Damien Timmer, executive producer at United Productions, have all made similar moves in the last 12 months. Could C4's budget cuts, ITV's exit from the FTSE 100 and threats to the BBC's licence fee mean talent is fleeing to the indie sector?</p> <p>\"I don't agree British broadcasting is collapsing,\" Allen argues. \"The BBC spends more money on comedy than any other broadcaster, but there's a bigger world out there. If you make a brilliant show for the BBC, more often than not, when the transfer happens it doesn't happen with you. As much as you want to look after that show as it crosses the Atlantic, your heart should be in giving the licence payer what they pay for - more British programming. With all the excitement about British comedy in the US - from The Office to Peep Show - it's a good time to not be in-house.\"</p> <p>A US influence can also be found in \"first look\" and development deals that Big Talk are in the process of signing with Robert Popper - who commissioned Spaced at Channel 4 and produced Look Around You and Peep Show - and Simon Curtis, the drama producer-director behind Cranford. The company's slate includes Jeremy Dyson adapting Jonathan Coe's What a Carve Up! for TV and a \"will they won't they?\" sitcom for Channel 4 called Free Agents, starring Sharon Horgan, Anthony Head and Stephen Mangan, which is due to hit screens in January. </p> <p>Will so many projects dilute the family atmosphere of Big Talk? \"There's no ambition to grow into a monolithic entity like Talkback that produces gardening programmes and series on dog training,\" Allen insists. </p> <p>\"It would be a shame if Big Talk lost its quirky editorial slant through huge growth,\" says Andrew Newman, C4's head of comedy and entertainment. \"They are one of the few companies who are yet to have made anything bad. It's all down to quality control and I think Nira has the judgment and relationships with people to make sure that doesn't happen.\"</p> <p>Pegg certainly doesn't see a problem with Big Talk replicating something like a US studio on a smaller scale. \"Working Title is the only British film production house that can get a British film made by itself,\" he argues. \"We like working with them. But it would be nice if there were other companies like that because it would mean a healthy British film industry.\"</p> <p>Big Talk's Worldwide deal, which will provide cash and confidence for expansion, is key to the company's aspirations. </p> <p>\"Distribution is becoming crucial to your business plan,\" Park says. \"Broadcasters are cutting what they pay per hour, so we have to use our knowledge of film financing, co-production and the like to make the kind of shows we'd simply get the budget for a few years ago.\"</p> <p>However, with Worldwide executives shortly to appear in front of the culture, media and sport select committee to explain its rapidly expanding commercial agenda, government curbs on Worldwide's activity could yet seriously hinder Big Talk's expansion. </p> <p>Not that the talent would be likely to leave if that were the case. \"Working with anyone other than Nira would be a step down,\" says Frost. \"I've worked with other independent companies and, to be honest, they've always seemed a bit hackneyed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sectarian cyber warfare in the Middle East has claimed its highest-profile victim yet, forcing a leading pan-Arab TV station to change its internet domain name.</p> <p>Al-Arabiya Television, based in Dubai, is taking legal action in the US to prevent further hacking after its website was hit by \"organized cyber piracy by extremists,\" the channel said at the weekend.</p> <p>Last Friday its hacked website displayed a burning Israeli flag and a statement that read: \"Serious warning: If attacks on Shia websites continue, none of your websites will be safe.\" </p> <p>No group claimed responsibility for the incident, but it followed weeks of hacking that apparently reflects rising tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims across the region.</p> <p>Al-Arabiya is owned by a Saudi company and is considered close to the conservative kingdom and bastion of the mainstream Sunni world.</p> <p>Someone claiming to be the hacker told Gulf News by email that al-Arabiya was a Wahhabi channel that wanted to \"start a war\" with Shia Muslims. Wahhabi is the term commonly used to refer to the puritanical Sunni Muslims who control the Saudi religious establishment.</p> <p>\"We are unbiased in our reporting and because of that we are constantly accused of backing the opposite side,\" said Anas Fouda, the channel's website editorial manager.</p> <p>The most controversial of the recent attacks targeted the website of Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani of Najaf, the Shia world's leading religious authority. Hundreds of other Shia sites were also affected.</p> <p>Sistani's site carried a statement accusing him of issuing \"perverse\" fatwas or religious edicts. Also posted was a YouTube clip of the American comedian Bill Maher joking about an edict on sexual behaviour allegedly handed down by Sistani. </p> <p>Iranian websites linked this action to controversial statements by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a leading Sunni cleric and host of a popular programme on al-Jazeera TV. Qaradawi had accused Shia of being \"heretics\" seeking to \"invade\" Sunni societies like his native Egypt. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards came a spate of attacks on several popular Sunni sites. </p> <p>The cyber warfare has provoked animated debate on Arab internet sites, with many bloggers calling for unity in the face of sectarian divisions and suggesting sinister motives or provocation are involved. \"Do you think the Zionists are doing this to make sure Muslims keep fighting with Muslims?\" asked one.</p>",

But it is Duncan's dreams that have been lost after the risks and costs involved in launching C4's three planned new radio services - including a spoken-word competitor to BBC Radio 4 - were deemed too great.</p> <p>Three Channel 4 stations were originally due to launch this year on the second national digital radio multiplex, awarded by Ofcom to the 4 Digital Group, in which C4 was the majority shareholder. The music and entertainment station E4 Radio was the last remaining station to be axed, saving the broadcaster an estimated \u00a310m next year, part of its bid to cut \u00a3100m in costs across the group.</p> <p>The remaining shareholders, who include UBC Media and Carphone Warehouse, will hold an emergency meeting this week to decide whether to go it alone or follow Channel 4's lead and call a halt to their digital investment.</p> <p><strong>Full-scale retreat</strong></p> <p>Such a full-scale retreat would deal a body blow to the commercial sector, which offers the 7.7 million people who have bought a digital audio broadcasting (DAB) radio set in the UK just one national digital station that is not already available on analogue - Planet Rock.</p> <p>Fifteen jobs will go because of C4's withdrawal, including the likely departure of its director of radio, Bob Shennan, the former BBC Five Live controller who quit the corporation under a year ago. And what next for Channel 4's other great digital radio champion, its director of new business and corporate development, Nathalie Schwarz?</p> <p>After last week's decision, not only have the three Channel 4 services been lost, but the other proposed stations run by former partners in the 4 Digital Group - including a spin-off of Bauer women's magazine Closer, UTV's Talk Radio and Sky News Radio - have also been thrown into doubt.</p> <p>DAB has been on the back foot since the former GCap Media chief executive Fru Hazlitt announced she was pulling the plug on the Capital and Classic FM parent's digital investment in February. The cuts were not enough to keep Hazlitt in a job. She was not the only commercial radio boss to be pessimistic about the future of digital radio, but industry executives have a habit of being rather more cheerful about the platform in public than they are in private.</p> <p>While take-up among listeners has been encouraging - in the second quarter of this year digital platforms accounted for 17.9% of all radio listening - commercial groups have so far been unable to make their investment pay. C4 estimates that its aborted plans cost less than \u00a35m, although the cost in time and credibility is much higher. Of total digital listening, 11% is via DAB radio sets, with another 3.3% via digital TV, and 2% on the internet, which has become a much more attractive proposition with the launch of the BBC's iPlayer almost a year ago.</p> <p>Commercial radio bosses had hoped that relatively cheap DAB radios would prove a success at Christmas and believe they can still maintain momentum in the all-important run-up to the festive season, despite C4's withdrawal. About 800,000 sets were sold in November and December last year, and this Christmas will see the first joint campaign across the BBC and commercial radio to promote the sets.</p> <p>But a DAB radio offering based solely on the BBC's digital services - including the comedy and drama station BBC7 and the Radio 2 spin-off 6 Music - is surely not a long-term option.</p> <p>Yet Simon Cole, the chief executive of 4 Digital shareholder UBC Media, says at least C4's withdrawal, after months of dithering, removes the uncertainty from the market. \"It is very regrettable that Channel 4 caused the excitement that they did, only to dash everyone's expectations in this way, but it doesn't mean the rest of us [have to follow suit],\" says Cole, whose company does not yet offer a digital station. </p> <p>\"For the last six months the radio industry has been repiecing the jigsaw of digital radio, and Friday's announcement was part of that. If anything it helps because it creates certainty and that is always a good thing. Difficult times force people together.\"</p> <p>When Duncan told staff the news on Friday, the reaction was muted. Given the need for cost-cutting - slashing into the programme budget so deeply that C4 is even considering dropping horse racing - it was seen as inevitable. Yet in private, there was amazement and anger that it had taken so long for Duncan to admit the obvious: the venture had no future. He seemed to have stubbornly backed a dead horse for much longer than anyone expected - but then he had bound himself to it.</p> <p>Beyond Duncan and a handful of supporters, the diversification had little internal support. An increasingly agitated board, led by the chairman, Luke Johnson, had debated the matter openly in February, and asked for a budget rethink. Digital radio was even seen, rightly or wrongly, as a distraction, perhaps (cruelly) as a displacement activity for a chief executive who came from a marketing rather than television background.</p> <p>Yet as late as June, the board signed off a scaled-back version, giving permission to launch the Digital 2 multiplex it controls while mothballing Channel 4 Radio, the expensive public service bit.</p> <p>At this point, says Duncan, it seemed to have takers for all the spare slots on the multiplex, which would have provided a rental income. But then they melted away as the recession loomed, leaving the 4 Digital Group.</p> <p>The venture has left many insiders bitter. \"What a mess. The truth is, nobody in programming or advertising sales thought it was a good idea,\" says a senior executive.</p> <p>Another simply says: \"I am furious about the waste of time. It isn't just the waste of millions of pounds at a time like this.\"</p> <p>More experienced hands, including Dorothy Byrne, C4's head of news and current affairs, had long warned Duncan that it would be impossible to challenge Radio 4 and its well-resourced programming with Channel 4 Radio's original budget of around \u00a312m.</p> <p>But Duncan stands by his argument that the plan was fundamentally sound - it was the ever-worsening economic circumstances that were to blame. \"It couldn't have been anticipated. The next 15 months are going to be very grim,\" he says.</p> <p>But where does that leave him? Duncan survived a huge professional challenge in 2007 over Celebrity Big Brother, which also knocked Luke Johnson. It is common knowledge that the two men have never really hit it off, but they manage to work together. Duncan has no intention of standing down over an abortive radio bid and, anyway, can point to having the board's backing.</p> <p>And these are certainly difficult times - not least for the media regulator, Ofcom, which will have its own questions to answer after awarding the licence to a consortium that has fallen apart in such spectacular fashion. Indeed, the owner of the first national digital radio multiplex, Digital One, told the regulator three years ago that it should not issue a second licence at all. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, there was an over-supply of capacity, which was always the biggest risk to be caused by another national multiplex at a time when the industry quite clearly was not able to afford it,\" says the former Digital One chief executive Quentin Howard, now president of WorldDMB, a forum to promote the take-up of DAB-based services worldwide.</p> <p>\"There is no pleasure in saying it, but those of us who were close to the industry and understood these things knew this was a likely consequence. It is regrettable that we had to go through all this faffing and instability; it has done short-term damage, no question about it.\"</p> <p>Tony Moretta, chief executive of the Digital Radio Development Board - the trade body supported by the BBC and commercial radio - says operators are queuing up to launch a national radio station on DAB. But who exactly? And why have they not already found a berth on Digital One, which has had plenty of spare capacity for some time?</p> <p>High prices might be to blame, as might the uncertainty caused by Channel 4's dithering. Such was the paucity of interest that a channel playing nothing but birdsong can be heard on Digital One, filling in airtime until a serious operator is found. NME Radio, which already broadcasts online and on digital TV, might be interested, as might Jazz FM, which relaunched online and on regional digital multiplexes earlier this month. But when MediaGuardian pressed one industry executive to name names, they came up with BFBS, owned by the British armed forces. A worthy service in its own right, no doubt, but unlikely to get them piling through the doors of Argos in the hunt for radios for Christmas.</p> <p>The launch of a new music digital station could cost anything between \u00a35m and \u00a310m in its first year of operation. A speech format, anything between \u00a310m and \u00a315m. If the history of DAB tells us anything, it is that new stations done on the cheap - jukebox broadcasters run by computers out of an empty studio - do not attract advertising.</p> <p>The BBC's director of audio and music, Tim Davie, who succeeded digital's great champion, Jenny Abramsky, last month, said Channel 4's withdrawal was \"disappointing news\" for UK radio.</p> <p>But he said the corporation remained \"positive\" about the future of digital radio and DAB. \"DAB will continue to offer high-quality services that are proven to have significant appeal to radio listeners, and we look forward to working in partnership with all the industry to drive further growth of the platform.\"</p> <p>But now the BBC has lost its most high-profile commercial partner. Freeview, which has long been mooted as a model for the relaunch of DAB radio, would not have worked if it had only offered BBC stations. Neither will digital radio.</p> <p><strong>Tuning Out</strong></p> <p><strong>July 2007</strong> Channel 4 wins the licence for a second national digital multiplex, taking a controlling 55% stake in a consortium of investors.

  "<p>Controversial plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism\">detain terror suspects</a> without charge for up to 42 days are likely to be rejected overwhelmingly by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a> today, piling fresh pressure on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> to abandon the proposal.</p> <p>The strength of feeling among peers is highlighted today by Lord Goldsmith, Tony Blair's long-serving attorney general. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/uksecurity-labour\">an article for the Guardian</a>, Goldsmith writes: \"This pernicious provision should be removed from this bill now. I regard it as not only unnecessary but also counterproductive; and we should fight to protect the liberties the terrorists would take from us, not destroy them ourselves. This proposal is wrong in principle and dangerous in practice.\"</p> <p>Peers will today have their first chance to vote on the detention plan when the government's counterterrorism bill is debated at committee stage in the upper house. It is widely expected that peers will reject the measure in large numbers, with Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peers joining forces.</p> <p>Rejection by the Lords would mean that Brown would have to muster a majority in the Commons for a series of new votes if he wants to see the measure passed into law. Peers are prepared for a lengthy session of parliamentary \"ping pong\", the process in which an amended bill is thrown back and forth from one chamber to another for repeated votes. If this ends in deadlock, Brown would have to wait a year before using the Parliament Act to force the measure through against the will of the Lords.</p> <p>Campaigners against 42-day detention believe that Brown is not prepared for such a battle as he cannot guarantee another Commons majority. The measure was passed in the Commons in June by only nine votes after the nine Democratic Unionist MPs supported the government. Since then, the number of opposition MPs has increased by two. John Howell replaced Boris Johnson, who had already stood down as MP for Henley and therefore did not vote, and John Mason won Glasgow East for the SNP from Labour.</p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of the human rights group Liberty, said: \"We are all learning the lessons of abandoning ethics in the marketplace. But it is just as dangerous to abandon them in the fight against terrorism. We hope and believe that the Lords will reject the discredited plan and that in the spirit of national unity the government will then drop it.\"</p> <p>The vote comes as 42 British writers come together to make plain their anger at the detention plans. Among those involved in the campaign, which is coordinated by Liberty, are Philip Pullman, Monica Ali, Julian Barnes, Ian Rankin, Alain de Botton, Ali Smith and AL Kennedy. Each has produced work attacking the legislation, which is published online at <a href=\"http://www.42writers.com\">42writers.com</a>.</p>",
  "<p>How do we die? With drugs, oblivious, in a basement, frozen nobly on a mountain top, screaming in a car crash, or traditionally in a bed surrounded by our family and children, croaking out our last wishes? Or in hospital, where there are tubes and bleeps, where we are monitored, fed intravenously and kept alive till the last moment? Most of us shudder, try to think about something else and admit that we are with Woody Allen when he said he didn't fear death, he just didn't want to be there when it happened.</p> <p>But there are places where they have tried to bring death more under our control. Holland has an excellent assisted suicide plan and was the first country to adopt one. Less liberal ones exist in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany, which all have some way for the clued-up and determined to end their own lives. I had always thought it wouldn't work in Britain because we're too inefficient - if we can't even ensure that a sad old woman gets her shitty sheets changed, how can we be sure she has really chosen to die? - and that it wouldn't work in the US because it was so commercial. But Oregon is different.</p> <p>When the Pacific north-west state passed legislation in 1994 - finally implemented in 1997 - to make physician-assisted suicide legal, there were all manner of dire predictions: the old and tiresome, the poor and the marginalised would be wiped out; people in other states would pour in, demanding to be helped out of this world; the state's biggest city, Portland, would become the death city of America. There were nightmare memories of Jack Kevorkian, a maverick in Michigan who helped 130 people to kill themselves with no safeguards to speak of and was known as Doctor Death: he only came out of prison last year. Most importantly, there were fears that no one would bother with palliative care any more, because patients could simply be discontinued.</p> <p>None of this has happened, although the British Medical Journal last week reported that doctors in Oregon prescribing lethal doses of barbiturates may on three occasions have administered them to people with clinical depression. In cases where there is any doubt, patients should be referred to a psychiatrist, just one of many safeguards that were built into the legislation: a request must be made twice, two weeks apart, to prevent someone in a fit of gloom signing something they might later regret, and the signature has to be witnessed by two people, only one of whom may be a relative, so no two avaricious offspring can shunt mom into her grave.</p> <p>A doctor also has to certify that the patient has not long to live and is of sound mind, which includes not being clinically depressed; the doctor can write a prescription for the lethal dose, but the patient, or someone chosen by the patient, must get it from the pharmacist - and any pharmacist who has moral objections can refuse to supply it. </p> <p>A flood of suicidal incomers has been prevented - if there ever was a threat of them - by the fact that only residents can apply for physician assisted suicide (PAS). If someone arrives, says that they want to live in Oregon and please can they take advantage of PAS, there has to be extensive proof - house deeds, car licence and so on - that they really do want to live there as well as die. This can have sad consequences. I talked to a man who had lived in the state all his life, as had his wife. When he retired, they sold their house and went to live in Hawaii, but after only two years she developed terminal cancer and hoped she need not suffer to the end. But they were no longer Oregon residents and didn't qualify for PAS. </p> <p>Since the introduction of the Death With Dignity Act in 1997, remarkably few people have actually \"gone the Oregon way\" - only 431 (one death in 1,000). And only one in 10 of those who ask for a prescription actually end up using it - they feel secure knowing they have it as a last resort. Far greater numbers have an advance directive, setting out the treatments they don't want to have, even to prolong life. </p> <p>Of course, PAS is not the only way to go. There's an organisation that seems the equivalent to our Exit called the Hemlock Society that goes in for, in the scornful words of one nurse, \"booze and a plastic bag\". A surprising number of patients simply stop eating and drinking - not a pleasant way to go, but apparently one that upsets families and nurses less than taking a lethal dose. I talked to a diabetic who casually mentioned a cousin who had deliberately overdosed on insulin. And on my first morning in Oregon my middle-aged waitress asked me why I was there, and, when I told her, said approvingly that her sister had taken her own life after six years in pain: \"When she'd done it her face looked like she was 20.\" But this was before the change in the law, so how had she done it? \"She shot herself,\" she said cheerfully. \"There wasn't more than a little blood.\"</p> <p>The last time a euthanasia bill came before our parliament, much was made by Baronesses Knight and Finlay of the fact that allowing any form of assisted death had impacted badly on palliative care in Oregon. This was firmly refuted by the Oregon Hospice Association's then chief executive, Ann Jackson, who pointed out that hospice care in the state had doubled since the Act, that Oregon was rated the second best state in the US for it, and that the only measure on which they did not score highly was palliative care in hospitals - not surprising, since hospice care in Oregon follows the patient and 95% of it is done at home, where people prefer to die. They see their work as a British invention, revere the memory of Cicely Saunders and use \"hospice\" as a synonym for palliative care, not just for a care home. </p> <p>A survey of Oregon doctors also showed that, since PAS, they have actually taken more care with areas such as pain relief - presumably in the hope of making their patients content to stay alive. Of patients who opt for assisted suicide, 86% are hospice patients, and the hospices, originally opposed to it, now mostly accept and help with it, though any nurse with conscientious objections can give the patient a \"warm hand transfer\" to another. They also have foster care for some older, sicker people - a useful idea for families that can't cope or aren't around.</p> <p>Many hospice people, and their volunteers, see PAS as a friendly, reasonable way to end a life, better than being strung up to tubes and monitors in intensive care. Some of the volunteers create colourful quilts, to make things a bit less bleak for those who are in hospital. George Eighmey, of Compassion and Choice, the body that originally fought for the law and now helps people towards decisions in dying, told me of a woman who had had a double mastectomy and made a display of her three or four dozen bras on a clothesline, and of a man who had had bladder trouble who filled a row of potties with petunias and pansies - all part of trying to make illness and even death more homely, more bearable. </p> <p>The legislation is extremely tightly drawn, and efforts to prove it unconstitutional have so far failed. Some argue that all this could only happen in Oregon: California and Hawaii tried and didn't manage to introduce PAS, though Washington state is toying with the idea at the moment. Oregon, and Oregonians, are certainly cussed about not being told what to do by Washington DC or anyone else. They pride themselves on being the only state that refuses to allow any private building on the seashore that might keep people from getting to the beach; they refused to assure Homeland Security, the federal terrorist-chasers, that their local police force would cooperate with them; they coped with their litter by insisting on a return charge payable on bottles, and have the first oscillating water column for producing wave energy off the west coast. (It is also a state in which skateboarding is a legal form of transport on roads.) \"These are the rugged individualists who conquered the west,\" says Dr Linda Ganzini, who has done extensive research on assisted dying. Their conviction that people should be able to choose how they die is part of their insistence on their own autonomy - and in patient autonomy, as opposed to meekly doing what the doctor says. </p> <p>Far from being the sad and disadvantaged, the poor and the unwanted who are shuffled off into the hereafter, it is mostly the strong-minded and competent who achieve the death they have chosen. Patients don't always choose PAS for the most obvious reason, intractable pain: men can't bear the collapse of normal bodily functions and the fact that other people have to cope with them; women are more likely to despair of lives in which all the things that gave them any joy or satisfaction are now beyond them.</p> <p>So, is it all dead easy in Oregon? Not really. The very safeguards in the rules also serve to exclude some who might dearly love to have access to a planned and dignified death. It is the educated, the competent, those with a decent relationship with a doctor - which, in practice, usually means those with a decent relationship with health insurance - who are likely to seek it. The very poor have Medicaid, (which doesn't pay too well so not all doctors welcome it), those in employment or pensioned retirement have good insurance, and the elderly have Medicare. But it is very difficult for those who are hard up, in erratic employment but not actually on the streets - those who make up the 17% of those who have no insurance at all - to raise the required cash to form a satisfactory relationship with the doctor, who has to certify the patient has less than six months to go. This often excludes those with Aids or MS or, of course, Alzheimer's. Of the European countries that have assisted death, only Holland does not require death to be more or less imminent. Yet if you are bleakly in pain and not going to die pretty soon anyway, you might ache even more for an ending to it all.</p> <p>The hospitals that are in any sense religious won't have anything to do with it, and neither will federal hospitals - their personnel are told that if they even tell patients how they might access PAS, they'll be fired - though a few supporters of the legislation managed to ensure that it's only on hospital premises that they aren't to tell patients about it (it's OK, apparently, to slip them the word in the Starbucks across the street). The Oregon Health and Science University will take on such patients, the Kaiser Permanente HMOs - they are like mini health services - are not opposed, but any idea that it's a breeze in Portland, let alone in remoter areas, to demand an easy death is definitely wide of the mark.</p> <p>There is still virulent opposition. Many religious people are unalterably opposed (though there hasn't been any of the violence associated with anti-abortionists). Questions of life and death were brought into fierce public debate nationwide in 1998 by the case of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who had been kept alive in a coma for years following a heart attack. Her husband wanted her artificial feeding and breathing withdrawn, but her mother thought that even if she were never to regain consciousness, her life had value - and many agreed. After a prolonged legal battle, her feeding tube was withdrawn in 2005, leading to her death.</p> <p>The national organisation of the disabled, Not Dead Yet, thinks any suggestion that lives should be deliberately ended devalues the lives of the disabled, that the law \"deprives the disabled of the benefit of suicide prevention\". Many doctors, too, are deeply uncomfortable with the whole idea; their instinct is to keep the patient alive, come what may. Ganzini says that \"physicians feel uncomfortable because it is not what they know how to do and feel the patient is rejecting them, saying their care isn't good enough\". Quite a few will have nothing to do with it, which makes it even harder for the less competent or poorer patients to find the right help.</p> <p>On the Sunday I was in Portland, a friend took me to a barbecue, under towering, dark trees in warm autumn sunshine. There I met two or three people who had had some contact with PAS. They spoke sadly of dying but did not question the decisions of the deceased. One gentle woman who worked as a volunteer with patients said she had nothing against assisted suicide, but didn't think that was what we ought to be worrying about. What concerned her far more was the people who never, under their system, got good health care, who were old or sad or desperately poor and had no one to care for them; that, she said, was where we should be putting our efforts. </p> <p>She's probably right, but Oregon at least shows the way forward for dealing with the problem that is not brought about by too little health care, but almost by too much - by our ability to keep people alive long after they would once have served their term. The Oregon way of dealing with death is principled, comforting and a model of how things might be, once we face up to rethinking the end of life as we have rethought the beginning.</p> <h2>'It was the most peaceful, loving moment of my life' <br>One woman's account of her mother's assisted suicide </h2> <p>Some families have warm and precious memories of such a death. I spoke to Julie Macurchie, whose mother, Margaret Sutherland, chose to die this way at the age of 68. Sutherland was a feisty woman; divorced after 40 years, she made a life of her own. She discovered new friends, joined boards and became a volunteer in a local hospice. In 1985 she was diagnosed with lung cancer, having smoked for years. It appeared to be cured, but returned in 2000 and by September of that year her condition was diagnosed as terminal.</p> <p>\"There was no pretending,\" her daughter remembers. \"She was practical and pragmatic, as she had taught us to be. She was not weepy or depressed, and did as much as she could, but in December she woke up and couldn't get out of bed for pain.\" For three weeks they tried to get it under control in hospital and she had a morphine pump, but she still couldn't get out of bed. \"We brought her home and she said, 'I'm going to use Oregon's law.'\"</p> <p>There was the 15-day waiting period; her daughter got the medication. \"The morning she died there were five of us there; she was in her lovely big bed by the window, looking out on the river. She wanted a poem by Anne Dillard, and the 23rd psalm. We weren't a religious family but we found a Bible and began to read, then she said, 'No, not that version - I want the King James version,' and we managed to find that.</p> <p>\"She drank the medication with us all around her. She might have died alone in the dark but she was looking at all her children. It was the most peaceful loving moment of my life. I feel so lucky and fulfilled that I was able to do that for her. In five minutes she was unconscious and in 15 minutes she'd gone.\"</p>",
  "<p>England's position in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">Group Six</a> was strengthened by the goalless draw between <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Croatia</strong> in Kharkov, which left Fabio Capello's team two points clear at the top. </p> <p>The visitors had the better chances on Saturday evening, Ivica Olic heading against the crossbar in the 50th minute, while he and Luka Modric drew fine saves from the Ukraine keeper Andriy Pyatov.

  "<p>Last week, I wrote about a controversial hand from the WSoPE, where Brian Johnson bet 20,000 with A8, on a board of 7-K-Q-8-5, and Dave \"Devilfish\" Ulliott called with a pair of sixes. The debate was whether Johnson had made a brilliant value bet, or a suicidal play that just happened to win.</p> <p>Johnson has replied to that column on the internet, and it's worth reporting his own explanation of this action on the river. He gives various reasons, but this section is the most interesting: \"I had three possible moves on the river: fold (that ain't happening), check or fire out. I've played Dave enough to know checking in that situation would simply leave me having to answer a question (ie a bet) rather than being the one who asks it. He would definitely have come out blazing, regardless of his hand ...\"</p> <p>I am amazed to realise that, after three years of this column, we still haven't discussed \"the stopper bet\". This is a small or medium bet that you make, with a hand you think is winning but don't love, in order to stop your opponent betting bigger and giving you a tough decision.

  "<p>Sarah Palin was forced to expend precious time and political capital over the weekend fighting to contain the fallout from the so-called Troopergate affair, following an official investigation in Alaska that reprimanded her for abusing her office as governor in pursuit of a family feud.</p> <p>Palin attempted to neutralise the findings into her official conduct by labelling the inquiry a \"partisan circus\". </p> <p>\"I'm thankful that the report has shown that there was no illegal or unethical activity there,\" she told reporters at a campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Saturday, adding that the investigation was \"a partisan kind of process that had been undertaken by some of the legislators who haven't been real happy with anything that I've done along the way as governor\".</p> <p>The vice-presidential candidate emphasised the fact that the investigation, carried out by a former prosecutor, Stephen Branchflower, had exonerated her from any impropriety in her decision to sack the head of Alaska's public safety commission, Walt Monegan, soon after she came to office. The inquiry concluded that as governor she had every right to choose her top officials.</p> <p>But she glossed over the findings that she had broken ethics rules, which amounted to an abuse of her office. The report found that she had applied pressure on Monegan to dismiss her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, a state trooper who had been through an acrimonious divorce with Palin's sister.</p> <p>Palin's husband, Todd, came under particular scrutiny in the 300-page Troopergate report, which was published on Friday. It noted that he spent half his time in the governor's office, making full use of state facilities and participating in official meetings.</p> <p>He also made extensive approaches to officials in which he called on them to fire Wooten. Branchflower concluded that these were \"impermissible\" and put officials in a conflict of interest.</p> <p>In an official representation to the inquiry, Todd Palin denied any wrongdoing. \"I have heard criticism that I am too involved in my wife's administration,\" he said. \"My wife and I are very close. We are each other's best friend. I have helped her in her career the best I can, and she has helped me.\"</p> <p>Republican officials likened his role to that of the politically engaged first lady Eleanor Roosevelt during the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>Palin's characterisation of the report as a \"partisan circus\", made during a conference call with reporters, is likely to be strongly disputed by the cross-party committee of the Alaskan legislature, which commissioned the inquiry and unanimously agreed to publish it. </p> <p>The events put under the microscope by the report occurred before Palin was nominated by John McCain to be his Republican presidential running mate. </p> <p>But the findings come as a further blow to the standing of the Alaskan governor who has already been damaged by a series of clumsy television interviews, and provides further distraction from McCain's attempts to revitalise his campaign in the face of a Democratic surge.</p>",
  "<p>On April 15 1945, the British 11th Armoured Division, chasing the remnants of the Nazi army in Lower Saxony, came upon and liberated the notorious Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, then under SS control. Accompanying the division was Richard Dimbleby of the BBC and the Rev Leslie Hardman, then a young Jewish army chaplain, who has died aged 95. </p> <p>Dimbleby's brilliant, chilling account of the suffering and degradation that he found at the camp shocked the British public. For Hardman, charged with the task of officiating at the burial of tens of thousands of the corpses of his co-religionists, the liberation was also a defining moment. For a brief instant he questioned his own faith. His doubts were answered, in and through a determination to assist in and witness the re-establishment of an independent Jewish state. His Judaism and his Zionism were inseparable thereafter.</p> <p>Hardman was born in Glynneath, South Wales, less than two years after a series of organised attacks, carried out mainly by mineworkers, that had driven many orthodox Jewish families out of the Welsh valley communities in which they had settled as refugees from Tsarist persecution. His family moved to Liverpool, where he grew up within a practising orthodox Jewish household. He evinced a vocation for the ministry, but combined purely religious studies at yeshivot (seminaries) in Liverpool and Manchester with attendance at Leeds University, where he gained a BA and then an MA degree in Hebrew and Semitics. In due course he obtained a ministerial appointment at St Anne's in Lancashire, subsequently moving back to Leeds. </p> <p>Hardman was then a run-of-the-mill Anglo-Jewish clergyman, complete with clerical dog collar (then worn even by the likes of Chief Rabbi Joseph H Hertz), combining the duties of synagogue officiant with teaching in religion classes and acting also as local shochet - poultry and cattle slaughterer. He was not a \"rabbi\" - that is, a recipient of a rabbinical diploma awarded after prolonged study and intensive examination - and neither was, nor ever claimed to be, an authority on the Talmud. His great strength lay rather in his capacity for pastoral work, in which he was immeasurably assisted by his wife, Josi, whom he had married in 1936. Hardman possessed all the qualities necessary for social work. He was a good listener. He was imbued with a great deal of common sense. He never talked down to those (and they included non-Jews) who sought his advice. </p> <p>These qualities were put to the supreme test during the war. In 1942, with Chief Rabbi Hertz's support and imprimatur, he joined the British Army as a chaplain. Famously, Hardman insisted on carrying a gun in his holster. Through the experience of Belsen he gained a deep insight into the ideology of the anti-semite. He was present at an early interrogation of the camp commandant, Josef Kramer; the experience of this encounter made as great an impression on him as the horrors of the camp itself, for Kramer (hanged in December 1945) was without the slightest regret or remorse. In 1958, assisted by Cecily Goodman, Hardman published The Survivors, a grim record of his Belsen days, which became a sourcebook for the 2007 BBC TV docudrama The Relief of Belsen.</p> <p>In 1947, Hardman was appointed minister of the Hendon Synagogue, in north-west London. The Hendon community was well-to-do, but not very observant. It boasted a mixed-sex choir, which Hardman abolished in 1951, and its interior was practically rebuilt in 1963 so as to conform to strict orthodox requirements. </p> <p>Hardman was no fundamentalist. He had no qualms about politely kissing his female congregants in public, and more than once was known to berate his congregation for being more concerned with the performance of ritual than with the pursuit of ethics. He supported the \"heretic\" rabbi Louis Jacobs, whom Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie prevented from becoming principal of Jews' College on account of Jacobs' views on the divine origin of the Torah. Yet Hardman believed strongly in the inclusivist mission of the United Synagogue (of which Hendon was a constituent); there was never any question of him following Jacobs into whatever lay beyond its boundaries.</p> <p>Hardman's relationship with his congregants was not a uniformly happy one. He was a Zionist, but, more than that, he was a paid-up member of Herut, the party of the violently anti-British Menachem Begin. Hardman was also acutely aware of the political influence that the Jews of Hendon might wield, if they chose to, and he positively delighted in disobeying the admonitions of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the leadership of which deprecated any invocation of Jewish political pressure at the hustings. During and after the Yom Kippur war (1973) he was unashamed in his use of the pulpit for political purposes. In 1974, he urged Jews in Hendon North to support John Gorst, the sitting Tory MP who had voted against the Heath government's embargo of arms shipments to Israel. Six years later, he issued a scarcely veiled warning to Margaret Thatcher, in neighbouring Finchley, after Lord Carrington (as foreign secretary) had declared that the Palestine Liberation Organisation was not \"terrorist\". Generally, however, Hardman's relationship with Thatcher was positive, even amiable. </p> <p>On his retirement in 1982, Hardman was made emeritus minister of the Hendon Synagogue. He immersed himself in Holocaust education work, and was appointed MBE in 1998. His wife died in 2007. There were four daughters of the marriage, two of whom predeceased him. He is survived by two daughters, seven grandchildren and 26 great-grandchildren.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Leslie Henry Hardman, clergyman, born February 18 1913; died October 7 2008</p>",
  "<p>For retail magnate Sir Philip Green, the rationale for his weekend shopping trip to Iceland to buy debts held by the country's collapsed banks should be obvious.</p> <p>\"If you're on your way home and you go past a house with a sign outside saying 'half price', you're going to knock on the door, aren't you?\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>The Topshop owner jetted to Iceland last Friday to negotiate a deal with the stricken Icelandic retail investor Baugur. It could deliver him, at a big discount, stakes in or control of high-street brands including House of Fraser, Mappin &amp; Webb, Oasis, Warehouse and Whistles. If it comes off, shoppers will be able to throw a stone on London's Oxford Street and be pretty sure it will hit a Green-owned store.</p> <p>As his advisers tried to untangle Baugur's web of debts and holdings, Green told the Guardian yesterday that the dynamic behind the deal was simple: \"There's a buyer and there's a seller and that's how business has always been done. It's just that there's not many buyers now.\"</p> <p>Green, 56, is one of the few tycoons with the funds to spare. With a personal fortune estimated at more than \u00a34.3bn by the Sunday Times rich list, he is Britain's ninth wealthiest man. He expects a significant discount on debts that he said yesterday could be worth \u00a31bn to \u00a32bn.</p> <p>His proposal may appeal to Iceland's authorities because it would inject a substantial amount of foreign currency into the country's monetary system. With most banks and private investors unable to raise funds, Green's move has highlighted the power of cash-rich individuals in the current climate. </p> <p>Green denied he was preying on a crippled investor, and said that the deal could help prop up confidence on Britain's high street, which is facing a recession.</p> <p>\"Its not my fault they have to sell,\" said Green. \"I don't want to see any of these brands fail. If something happens to shock the high street, that may get out of control. We don't want a major retail accident.\" </p> <p>He said the deal would take up to 48 hours to complete.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/12/CREDIT.pdf\">Map: State aid: how governments have intervened</a></p> <p>The European Union's core countries last night agreed a common rulebook to bail out their banking sectors, kickstart the stalled markets, partly nationalise distressed financial institutions, and try to rebuild public confidence in capitalism through massive state intervention.</p> <p>The radical rescue measures, designed to be flexible but also modelled on the emergency plan unveiled last week by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, are expected to be followed by a flood of legislative action this week as key governments in the eurozone move to shore up their national markets and systems.</p> <p>The French cabinet is to rush through a new bill today aimed at recapitalising banks although the finance ministry says that few if any French banks are requesting the kind of assistance being promised.</p> <p>More substantially, Germany's Bundesbank, finance ministry and Chancellor Angela Merkel's economics adviser have drafted emergency legislation that is to go before a special cabinet session today and is expected to be rushed through both chambers of parliament in Berlin this week.</p> <p>The German plan is expected to offer up to \u20ac400bn (\u00a3315bn) in bail-outs, liquidity funds, and to guarantee inter-bank lending. The German plan, resisted by Merkel for the past week, is said to make \u20ac100bn available for recapitalising the country's banks by perhaps establishing a national \"bank trust\". Most of the remaining funding would be aimed at freeing up bank lending in order to get money coursing through the economy again. Merkel yesterday denied the state aid would be tantamount to nationalising any of the banks.</p> <p>Portugal said yesterday it would provide around \u20ac20bn to try to shore up the markets and the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, is also said to be an admirer of the British bail-out scheme.</p> <p>Last night's Paris summit of the 15 leaders of eurozone countries was the first such session since the euro was launched. It was called at the last minute on Friday at Spanish insistence and because some of the smaller EU countries were angry at last weekend's Paris summit of the EU big four, Germany, France, Italy and Britain.</p> <p>The scheme being agreed last night is effectively a Franco-German version of the British blueprint, finessed at a summit on Saturday between Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy in eastern France.</p> <p>Merkel described last night's session as \"an extremely important summit. The aim is a coordinated and common process for the eurozone, so that in the days ahead national measures can be taken that do not discriminate against member states.\"</p> <p>That meant that she remained firmly opposed to the establishment of a pan-European rescue fund. Merkel and Sarkozy ruled out any such fund on Saturday. Instead the scheme agreed last night created common rules and a \"toolbox\" for the 15 countries of the eurozone that all commit to observe and to use in dealing with their specific national problems.</p> <p>The aims of the 13-point plan are to;</p> <p>\u00b7ensure appropriate liquidity for banks and lenders</p> <p>\u00b7facilitate bank funding \"which is currently constrained\"</p> <p>\u00b7allow for efficient recapitalisation of distressed banks.</p> <p>These three key points are the core elements of the British plan unveiled last week. Unusually, Gordon Brown was permitted to address yesterday's summit, although Britain is not a eurozone country. Afterwards he sounded satisfied that his selling of the British scheme had gone well.</p> <p>The central measure of last night's plan and the aspect that the prime minister views as the most important is the move by governments to underwrite the banks' short- and medium-term lending in order to release orthodox banking activities.</p> <p>\"People are looking not only to the markets, but to governments,\" said Brown. \"The purpose is that banks can resume and are able to lend to small businesses and homeowners.\"</p> <p>The guarantees for inter-bank lending under the eurozone scheme are to last only until the end of next year and are to operate \"on appropriate commercial terms\", underwriting \"new medium-term (up to five years) bank senior debt issuance.\" The action can vary from country to country to reflect the variations in national market conditions.</p> <p>The guarantees are valid for all banks operating in the eurozone countries and for subsidiaries of foreign banks \"with substantial operations\".</p> <p>With the action plan agreed by 15 countries last night and with Britain delighted to be accorded a trailblazing role in the measures agreed, the scheme will go to a full EU summit in Brussels on Wednesday, where it is certain to be joined by the other 11 member states.</p> <h2>Three key points</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> European Central Bank to intervene in attempt to boost liquidity</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Eurozone governments to underwrite bank debt until end of next year</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Governments to commit to prevent collapse of \"systemically relevant institutions\" through recapitalisation if necessary</p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/10/12/CREDIT.pdf\">Map: State aid: how governments have intervened</a></p>",
  "<p>John Toshack was entitled to claim Craig Bellamy should have departed with the match ball, but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/wales\">Wales</a> captain did not sound like someone who was struggling to come to terms with his contribution. Numerous chances were spurned against a country ranked 135th in the world but relief and not regret was Bellamy's overriding emotion as he celebrated his return from injury and pointed to a record that promises a more rewarding evening in Germany on Wednesday.</p> <p>On another occasion and against less forgiving opposition it might have been difficult to adopt such a positive approach. But after starting his first competitive match for Wales in almost 12 months, the striker was not about to let a bout of profligacy, including an embarrassing first-half penalty miss - \"It was that bad the keeper nearly dived over it,\" he joked - overshadow the satisfaction he took from completing 81 minutes without once looking in the direction of the medical staff.</p> <p>\"If I scored a hat-trick and played as well as I could have, and I ran into the corner and pulled up lame, that would have destroyed me,\" said the West Ham forward on Saturday night. \"So to come off and feel I am ready to play on Wednesday is great, as I have not been able to play consecutive matches for a long time. Not for one minute did I feel I winced. But do I think that I will be running corners, coming deep and running at people and looking a million dollars? Of course not.\"</p> <p>While his match-sharpness is likely to return over the coming weeks, Wales need Bellamy to rediscover his scoring touch in time for the meeting with the Group Four leaders in M\u00f6nchengladbach. There was a feeling it was not going to be his day here long before Peter Jehle, the impressive Liechtenstein goalkeeper, produced a one-handed save to turn over a near-post flick in the 71st minute following Simon Davies' adroit cut-back.</p> <p>\"I've missed bigger chances in games,\" said Bellamy, who will relinquish penalty duties after he became the third Wales player to miss in this campaign. \"It is like San Marino [last October] where the keeper got a hand to everything. It just seems to happen to me in these games. I don't seem to score against these teams. My goals have been against the decent sides at international level and there is no more decent team than Germany.\"</p> <p>With Bellamy's tally of 15 for his country including strikes against Italy and Argentina, it is a claim that is not without foundation. Either way, there is little doubt that the captain and his team-mates will need to be in more ruthless mood against Germany, when chances are sure to be at a premium. </p> <p>David Edwards provided good energy, the Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder marking his eighth cap with his first goal when he swept home after Davies and Chris Gunter combined on the right. A second should have arrived when Gareth Bale was upended but Jehle's save from Bellamy's weak penalty meant that Wales had to wait until Mario Frick deflected a header from the substitute Ched Evans into his own net 10 minutes from time.</p> <p>It can be assumed that the Wolves manager Mick McCarthy, who had described Liechtenstein as \"a pub team\", was expecting a more convincing victory. \"I told my team-mates about [McCarthy's comments] and it is a question about respect,\" said Franz Burgmeier, the Liechtenstein midfielder who plays his club football for Darlington. \"He was the Ireland coach 10 years ago when they drew in Liechtenstein, so maybe he didn't remember that.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> David Edwards (Wales)</p>",
  "<p><strong>On a recent documentary Kate Moss seemed to design her collection for Topshop by just getting things out of her wardrobe or finding vintage pieces and telling Topshop to copy them. Is this how designers work these days?</strong></p> <p><strong>Sarah Morris</strong>, London</p> <p>Oh, you picky, picky public people! What do you want from the poor, hard-working, straining-by-the-grit-o'-their-teeth fashion designers? Donatella, Karl Lagerfeld, Miuccia Prada - honestly, most of the time, they look as if they work down mines. Especially Karl, when he wears that little Chanel hard hat (quilted, obviously) - faaaaabulous. </p> <p>Anyway, there they are, making clothes that are quite nice and what do they hear? \"It's not original!\" \"You just nicked that from Oxfam!\" \"My gran wore something like that 70 years ago!\" I mean, WTF? Poor Marc Jacobs suffered a true arrow of outrageous fortune earlier this year when some totally tedious old Swedish dude complained that the pattern on a scarf in Jacobs' spring/summer collection was maybe a tiny bit similar (\"tiny bit similar\" being Swedish for \"exactly the sodding same\") to one his dad designed a trillion years ago in a totally foreign country and therefore completely irrelevant.</p> <p>But let's look at this from a different perspective. Clothes are great but after more than 2,000 years, most things have been done with them. This explains why Coco Chanel's designs from the early half of the 20th century keep being \"referenced\" by designers today, such as Luella Bartley and that kleptomaniac, Marc Jacobs. And why not? Why should we, modern-day dwellers, be denied nice clothes just because we were unfortunate enough not to have been born in 1922? </p> <p>Anyway, when designers do try to reinvent the wheel and proffer things such as wetsuits with giant cutouts trimmed with ruffles, what do they get for their pains? A massive photo in the tabloids with some hilarious and never-before-seen headline of the \"Do Designers Really Expect Us To Wear THIS?!?!?!?\" ilk. </p> <p>So take your pick, Sarah: either an expensive version of something your mum gave to a charity shop 27 years ago, or a humpbacked coat made out of patent leather and fish scales. Yes, this does raise the query asked by pretty much everyone who's seen a Turner prize exhibition: why can't modern designers make nice things like in the old days? I cannot resolve the mystery as to why instead of Rembrandt we are stuck with Damien Hirst and his Blue Peter-esque skull, diamonds and glue gun, but I would argue that some designers today are, if not exactly Michelangelo, pretty handy with the ol' needle and thread. And also pretty good at spotting things to copy, which, after all, is a talent. Well, sort of.</p> <p><strong>I seem to have mutated back to a size 10 after having been size 12 all through my 50s. I am still fatter than I was in my 40s, so have the sizes changed?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kate Davis</strong>, by email</p> <p>Yes, and thank the good Lord for it. I've never been totally clear whether it's due to good nutrition or bad nutrition, but we are all much bigger than generations in times of yore, ushering in what is euphemistically called by the industry, \"a change of measurement scale\". This means that what was once a size 28 is now a size 12. Now there's a whole new set of neuroses for women's magazine readers. </p> <p>Partly this is a sop to sensitive consumers' feelings: just as you shouldn't buy something from a shop where the sales assistant made you feel as if you were asking her to be a surrogate mother because you asked where the underwear section is, so you wouldn't hand money over to a label that told you that you are 10-tonne Tessie. Yes, yes, we should all get beyond size concerns but, for the moment, most people don't seem to be able to, except you, Kate, whose reaction to this size malarkey is more \"baffled into writing a letter to a newspaper\" than \"flattered into buying lots of clothes\".

  "<p>While most of the world spent the weekend trembling for its wealth, in Afghanistan the Taliban busied themselves dying in quite large numbers, during an ill-advised assault on Helmand's provincial capital, Lashkar Gar. Around 50 insurgents were killed, for no loss to Nato and Afghan security forces.</p> <p>This fits the war's pattern. Almost every time the Taliban fights a battle, it loses to overwhelming firepower. Unfortunately, such western successes are strategically meaningless. Nato is absent from vast areas of this intractable country, where the insurgents prosper. There is greater gloom about the conflict than at any time since the Taliban was ousted in 2001.</p> <p>I spent a week in Afghanistan in September, and was shocked by the deterioration since my last visit two years ago. The British army, which justly prides itself on its \"can-do\" philosophy, has been sobered by recent experience. Its casualties are acceptable within a context of progress. But they become dismaying against a background of growing Taliban influence and slumping confidence in the Kabul government.</p> <p>President Bush has decreed an American troop \"surge\" in Afghanistan. Some 10,000 additional troops will be committed under General David Petraeus, the Iraq \"miracle worker\" who now runs US Central Command.</p> <p>Petraeus, the most impressive soldier America has produced since Colin Powell, is a clever and charismatic leader who might one day emerge as a presidential candidate. But he is well aware that Afghanistan is not Iraq. It is a far more primitive society, whose people find it hard to perceive the merits of any central government - least of all one as corrupt as President Hamid Karzai's - and which is now trapped in a narco-economy.</p> <p>It is almost impossible for westerners, military and civilian alike, to engage with Afghans. Almost none speak the language. It is only possible to travel outside heavily fortified bases in helicopters or armoured vehicles. Afghan gratitude for the creation of a few schools and hospitals is outweighed by the simple fact that, in a diplomat's words: \"Seven years ago most of the population felt safe. Now they don't.\"</p> <p>He added brutally: \"The British army has been irresponsible in suggesting that it could do the business in Helmand. We should never have taken it on. It's much more than we can handle.\"</p> <p>The only bright spot in an overwhelmingly dark picture is the growing effectiveness of the Afghan army. Its troops are fighting well, as Afghans usually do, whoever they happen to be shooting at. Smart westerners argue that we should abandon any notion that Nato can win this war with its own troops, instead concentrating on helping Afghans to defend their own government - if they are willing.</p> <p>The Kabul regime is pitifully short of credible people to run the country. I met Barna Karimi, the deputy local government minister, a 34-year-old former exile who spent 17 years in California before returning here to work for Karzai. Unsurprisingly, he talks the language of US business schools: \"We have developed a strategic framework,\" he says. \"We are constantly evaluating the performance of our governors and district governors. We have formulated a social outreach programme which revives the traditional role of the community. You guys\" - he means westerners, of course - \"don't have the problem of lacking a system. I am trying to create a system without qualified people.\"</p> <p>Listening to this fluent but unmistakably Californian young social engineer, parachuted into Afghanistan from an unimaginably alien culture, I found it impossible to believe that Afghans relate to him as one of themselves.</p> <p>The newish governor of Helmand, Gulab Mangal, is much more convincing. He is 52 years old and a former commissar in the Afghan army in Russian times; he was a businessman and ruler of two other provinces before he was transferred to Helmand during the summer. The British are much in love with Mangal, whom they perceive as one of the country's only honest and able officials. Their enthusiasm is dangerous, however. It feeds Karzai's morbid suspicions of him as a prospective rival.</p> <p>When I told Mangal how much his efforts are admired, he said wryly: \"Nobody in Kabul seems to appreciate them.\" He acknowledges that more than half of Helmand is today under Taliban control. \"When government can't deliver,\" he said, \"people think it better to have no government. We need to convince people that we are working for them. If we cannot do that, it would be better to go.\"</p> <p>I found it easy to understand why foreigners are so impressed by Mangal's poise and courage. There are few people in Afghanistan whom more people want to kill. Every time he goes out to walk in a bazaar, there is a real chance that he will come back dead.</p> <p>The British are desperately impatient for the impending US change of government. They believe that an Obama presidency will recognise the impossibility of military solutions in Afghanistan. It might throw its weight behind finding a substitute for Karzai and talking a way out of this shambles. </p> <p>On these pages Simon Jenkins has said from the outset that the Afghan war is unwinnable. I have always shared his dismay about western blundering. Yet it seems to me that we must keep trying, though the odds against success are greater than ever. It is futile to escalate the Nato troop commitment. The only slender chance of stabilising Afghanistan lies in sustaining military and economic aid for Afghans to help themselves.</p> <p>The highest aspiration must be for controlled warlordism, not conventional democracy. A civil war may prove an essential preliminary before some crude equilibrium between factions can be achieved. If this sounds a wretched prognosis, it is hard to find informed westerners with higher expectations.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago today the law lords brought a stop to the Spycatcher juggernaut. The British government's obsession with preventing the publication of the memoirs of a bitter ex-spy - a man described in a Guardian leader of the time as a deranged fascist - came to matter more than anything his book revealed. It led to the humiliation of the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, who (paraphrasing Burke) told a Sydney court room that he had been \"economical with the truth\". It forced the security services on to a shady legal footing. And it caused the courts to rule in favour of an open press, after a legal battle which dragged in 21 British judges, as well as others in that famous Sydney courtroom. For much of that time an injunction against the Guardian and the Observer prevented this paper from revealing anything about the content of the book - one, said Andrew Rawnsley, that \"no one is allowed to have, but everyone has read, about a plot nobody can mention to undermine a government which must remain nameless\". On October 13 1988, the ruling was lifted. Along the way, the case made the Peter Wright's lawyer, Malcolm Turnbull, famous - he is now leader of the Australian opposition. As for Mr Wright's rambling prose: how many of the many people who smuggled Spycatcher in from abroad, or borrowed it from those Labour-run libraries brave enough to stock it, would even have given it a second glance if the government had not stirred up such excitement by trying to ban it?</p>",
  "<p>This evocative old ground has staged its final European match but as the curtain fell in Llanelli reality dawned for Scarlets. By the time they cross town on December 12 to play their first Heineken Cup match against Ulster in their \u00a323m spanking new stadium, Parc y Scarlets, the club could be out of the competition.</p> <p>Scarlets travel to Paris this weekend for a difficult game against Stade Fran\u00e7ais and, after a remarkable turnaround here in a game they contrived to lose after leading 19-3 at the interval, the waters in Pool Four look to be closing over their heads. It was a game of two halves and, well, a game of two halves. For the first 40 minutes Stephen Jones helped control the match for the Welsh while Chris Malone, an unsung Australian apparently keeping the No10 seat warm until Nick Evans returns from injury this month, had a shocker.</p> <p>Malone was not alone. Quins, whose second string had come within two points of beating Ospreys in Swansea the previous weekend, looked like a third team as Scarlets ran rings around them from the opening minute when Morgan Stoddart cruised past Charlie Amesbury for their first try. Amesbury, a David Strettle lookalike who is standing in for the injured England wing, was again powerless as Mark Jones squeezed over for a try in the same corner 10 minutes later and the script appeared to have been written. The swankpots from Twickenham, who failed to win a game in the Heineken Cup last season, would be pulling out of Stradey Park on their luxury coach, howls of derision ringing in their ears.</p> <p>John Kingston, the gruff Harlequins coach, had different ideas. \"At half-time he gave us an absolute bollocking,\" said Malone, as he clutched a glass vase, his reward for being man of the match. \"John smashed into us with some strong words. If Mike Brown hadn't have made a try-saving tackle just before half-time we might not have been able to turn the game around but we had mountains of experience on the bench and in the second half we did to them what they had done to us in the first.\"</p> <p>Malone, who could hardly find the safety of the touchline in the first half, suddenly began to look like Phil Bennett. His kicks at goal cut into the Scarlets lead, Danny Care slipped over for an opportunist try from a tapped penalty and the colour began to drain from Scarlets' cheeks. Crucially their hooker Matthew Rees was sent to the sin-bin on the hour for a late tackle on the replacement hooker Tani Fuga. Fuga, Nick Easter and George Robson had come on five minutes earlier and all three galvanised the visitors' pack. By the time Malone hoisted a perfect kick towards the corner for his wing Ugo Monye to gather and blast over for the winning try the Scarlets were chasing shadows in the mellow autumn sunshine.</p> <p>\"The Heineken Cup passed us by last year,\" added Malone. \"This year we have vowed we don't want to just get to the end of the pool stage having just made up the numbers. We have a strong squad and I want to be the first-choice No10.\" The All Black Evans may have a fight on his hands to wrest the No10 shirt from Malone.</p> <p><strong>Scarlets</strong> Stoddart; Daniel, King (Higgitt, 68), Evans, M Jones (C Thomas, 76); S Jones, Martens (Roberts, 62); I Thomas, Rees, Meeuws, Cooper (N Thomas, 74), Maling (MacLeod, 30), Easterby (capt), G Thomas, Lyons. </p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Stoddart, M Jones. <strong>Pens</strong> S Jones 4. </p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Rees, 60. </p> <p><strong>Harlequins</strong> Brown; Amesbury, Tiesi (Taione, 64), Turner-Hall, Monye; Malone, Care (Gomarsall, 75); C Jones, Botha (Fuga, 55), Ross, Kohn (Robson, 55), Evans, Robshaw, Skinner (capt), Guest (Easter, 55). </p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Care, Monye. <strong>Cons </strong>Malone 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Malone 5. </p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>C Berdos (France).</p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 8,236.</p>",
  "<p>Charl Schwartzel won the Madrid Masters yesterday with a flawless five-under 66 to finish three shots ahead of Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez at the Club de Campo course, and that despite nearly withdrawing from the tournament before the weekend.</p> <p>The South African admitted afterwards that a shoulder problem and a virus had made him think twice about competing, but he persevered following a telephone conversation with his father on Friday. \"I spoke to my Dad and he told me to tee off and see how I feel,\" he said. \"I haven't felt great. I had a shoulder problem and some sort of flu bug which has been going around - several other players on the Tour have had it. I've been waking up in the mornings feeling achy and sore and not having any energy, but this morning I actually felt a bit better and I'm glad I kept my swing going the way it has been the past three days.\"</p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez, the Argentinian who shot a nine-under 62 in the third round, threatened in patches, while Spain's Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal produced two early birdies but could not find the spark that ignited his nine-under 62 on Saturday. A 67 saw him finish third on 15 under.</p> <p>The 7th hole was the turning point in the battle between Schwartzel and Gonz\u00e1lez. The former hit his second right of the green but produced a controlled chip out of the trees to within three feet and sank the putt for birdie. Gonz\u00e1lez, however, had a five-footer for birdie which slid wide, allowing the South African to go three ahead.</p> <p>England's Robert Rock launched a barrage of birdies on his way to a 64 and a tie for fourth place. \"My goal was to finish in the top 10 and it's great,\" he said. \"I'll have to check if I've secured my [Tour] card. Next week is also important but if I play half decent, I'll get it done.\"</p>",
  "<p>Following the controversial police shooting of solicitor Mark Saunders, a high court judge has expressed serious reservations about the \"opportunity for collusion\" being \"institutionalised\" in the \"production\" of police statements (Shot solicitor's case throws spotlight on gun police, October 11). This precedes the Association of Chief Police Officers' meeting to revise guidelines regarding sharing \"recollections\" by officers prior to constructing individual statements.</p> <p>It is nearly 20 years since the Hillsborough disaster, when officers on duty were instructed not to make entries in pocket books but to submit handwritten recollections to a team of senior officers. Their recollections were then submitted to the force solicitors and on their advice altered, in some cases substantially. How did \"collusion\" work? An officer I interviewed, who subsequently gave evidence to a judicial scrutiny, stated that he and fellow officers were taken for a drink by a chief superintendent who said: \"Look, unless we get our heads together and straighten this out, there are heads going to roll.\" Many of his colleagues felt their integrity had been compromised by a force management determined \"to sanitise the whole event and protect themselves\". </p> <p>The process of \"institutionalisation\" did not end there. The external police inquiry team, the South Yorkshire coroner and Lord Justice Taylor who headed the Home Office inquiry, were aware of the process through which officers' recollections were collected and transformed into evidential statements. Given the scale of collusion after Hillsborough it is remarkable that two decades on little has changed.<br><strong>Professor Phil Scraton</strong><br>Queen's University, Belfast</p>",
  "<p>The boom years for burlesque and variety were during the Great Depression, so it is with a consummate timing that Edinburgh Fringe favourites La Clique shimmy into the Hippodrome. They bring a show that will wipe away the blues with its sheer bare-faced cheek, ability to send itself up, and a gaudy aesthetic that owes more to the dressing-up box than to designer chic. </p> <p>In its glory days at the start of the 20th century, the Hippodrome's novelty acts included polar bears, elephants, and lions and tigers. Here, the attractions are of the human variety, and if the performers toy like naughty children with the illusion of danger and transgression, all of them are pussy cats who soon have the audience purring.</p> <p>Previous attempts to do burlesque in the West End have floundered on inappropriate venues and a deluded notion that the merest glimpse of a nipple tassel is worth 30 quid. La Clique ups the game through artful attention to detail, seamless stage management and the sheer levels of skill and wit involved. The lowbrow comes with a raised eyebrow here, whether it's in the subverting striptease spectacle of Ursula Martinez's infamous \"Hanky Panky\" act, or the English Gents (Australians, actually) who combine a slick balancing turn with a send-up of British stiff upper lips. Everything is just so; small but perfectly formed, and a lesson for credit-crunch theatre in working up something from nothing. </p> <p>Like all circus, there is a touch of the freak show, but lurking amid the supremely executed turns of Yulia Pikhtina's enchanting hula hoop routine is a perfect match of skill and content that gives rise to unexpected meaning and metaphor. Contortionist Captain Frodo's party piece may be dislocating his shoulder, but when he climbs up an increasingly precarious tower made from upturned buckets of diminishing size, his precarious ascent becomes a comment on the absurdity of all human endeavour. David O'Mer's jeans-clad bath-time aerial routine works both as a sexy showstopper and a knowing subversion of advertising's eroticisation of everyday life. And when the naked Martinez produces her final red hanky with a flourish, it is a reminder of who is in control here, and that women's bodies are not just objects to be fetishised. </p> <p>It's an evening that works on many levels, but most triumphantly as a piece of old-fashioned popular entertainment that is good, clean, dirty fun.</p>",
  "<p>The cost to the taxpayer of bailing out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">Britain's weakest banks</a> will escalate today when the government announces an injection of more than \u00a340bn into the country's struggling high street lenders.</p> <p>In a sign of the deepening financial crisis, the government is standing by to take majority stakes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbos\">HBOS</a>, owner of the country's biggest mortgage lender Halifax, and smaller stakes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">Barclays</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a>.</p> <p>Top executives from the big banks were in discussions with the Financial Services Authority, Treasury and Bank of England last night about how they would participate in the bail-out, originally intended to allow for \u00a325bn to be injected into banks immediately, with a further \u00a325bn later.</p> <p>But RBS and HBOS are likely to use \u00a325bn alone, and there were estimates last night that the total bill could rise to \u00a375bn. The three-part package also includes \u00a3200bn of fresh funds for interbank lending and a \u00a3250bn guarantee of bank debt.</p> <p>Last night Lloyds' emergency takeover of HBOS, brokered by Gordon Brown, was hanging in the balance. The government intervention is believed to have changed the dynamics of the emergency takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB and negotiations were thought to be under way last night to try to hammer out new terms by this morning.</p> <p>The continuing drama in the banking sector is likely to force the departure of Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS. The government is preparing to demand a seat on the board of the Edinburgh-based bank, which is expected to name Stephen Hester, a current non-executive director, as a successor to Goodwin. There may also be boardroom changes at other banks.</p> <p>Amid anxiety about how the febrile stockmarkets will react to the mounting role of the taxpayer, there were discussions last night about whether to temporarily suspend trading in bank shares to give traders time to digest the news.</p> <p>The banks and the authorities were working through the night with the intention of making a statement before markets open at 8am. Sources said yesterday that the government would assume a larger than expected control of banks after the dramatic fall in their share prices. They cite the example of RBS, which is now worth \u00a312bn but needs at least \u00a320bn to help it recapitalise. \"On these figures we are suddenly the majority shareholder,\" one government source said.</p> <p>HBOS, which had a market value of \u00a36.5bn on Friday, could need to raise up to \u00a312bn and Lloyds TSB \u00a35bn, with Barclays needing up to \u00a39bn. The terms of the fund-</p> <p>raisings are complex. Some of the shares may be ordinary shares, which give voting rights, and some could be preference shares, which do not. HBOS, for instance, could raise around \u00a39bn in ordinary shares and a further \u00a33bn in preference shares, while RBS could raise \u00a315bn in ordinary shares and \u00a35bn in preference shares.</p> <p>The rise in the size of the capital injections being demanded by the FSA over the weekend surprised some banks. But it is thought that the regulator is determined to draw a line under concerns about whether the capital cushions held by the banks are enough to prevent them collapsing.</p> <p>The government insisted it was not taking control of banks in the long term. \"This is not nationalisation. This is the banks coming to us requesting capital,\" the government source said. \"If we are going to take a significant share of these banks, we have got to protect the interests of the taxpayer. But we have no intention of taking a long-term stake. We will sell once we have returned to normality.\"</p> <p>Communities secretary Hazel Blears admitted the government was deciding whether to demand representation on bank boards. She told BBC Radio 4's The World this Weekend: \"This is not about bailing out very, very well-off people. This is about saying the immediate issue is getting sound banking, making sure that for the money we put into those banks then we get influence around lending policies, around bonus policies, because that's what the taxpayers want to see.\"</p> <p>Asked if the government would put people on the banks' boards, she said: \"I think we will certainly be giving [that] consideration.\"</p> <p>Chancellor Alistair Darling, who has returned from the IMF meeting in Washington, said everybody recognised the need to tackle three big problems - lack of liquidity, shortage of capital and the frozen state of credit markets.</p>",

  "<p>You can worry about pension funds losing great chunks of money, about firms going bankrupt, about the government getting morbidly obese with debt. But if you insist on worrying about the direction of prices then you should worry about deflation, not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">inflation</a>. </p> <p>Chris Payne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/inflation.banking\">wrote</a> on Wednesday that the various government interventions to try to save the markets \u2013 buying toxic assets, buying bank shares, and lowering interest rates \u2013 will cause inflation. In a sense this is exactly right, because they all involve releasing more credit into the market, which will increase the total amount of money in the system, lowering the value of existing money, meaning inflation. But the reason that the government is madly trying to pump credit into the system is because the banks, who control most of the private credit, are starting to turn off their own taps; without government intervention the worry would be <em>deflation</em>.</p> <p>Recessions always have a pressure towards deflation, just as booms are inflationary. There will be less demand everywhere \u2013 less demand for workers, for land, for cars and clothes \u2013 and so prices will fall.</p> <p>This much is true for a normal recession, but the deflationary pressure is even stronger for the particular type of recession we're falling into, the type that starts with banks not lending money. The fall in lending from banks reduces the amount of money in the system, which further causes prices to fall. When previous recessions have been started with credit crises, it often resulted in serious deflation, as in the US in the 1930s, Thailand in the late 1980s, and Japan in the 1990s.</p> <p>But what about the high world prices of oil and food? The members of the monetary policy committee at the Bank of England spent the first half of 2008 wringing their hands about the inflation that these high prices were causing, and it was this anxiety that made them delay cutting interest rates for such a long time. </p> <p>Does the deflation from a credit crunch trump the inflation from these commodity prices? Yes, by far. First, the commodity-price inflation was just a one-off jump in the price of imports, it's not the kind of systematic change that would get embedded into expectations of inflation continuing into the future (and it's when inflation gets into peoples' expectations that it causes real damage). Second, those prices have already fallen a lot since their peaks in March: oil, rice and corn are all back to the levels they were in late 2007.</p> <p>The one real reason to worry about inflation would be if the government over-reached in trying to stimulate the economy. The high inflation rates of the late 1970s and early 1980s, throughout western countries, were mainly a result of central banks trying to stimulate demand: they overestimated what could be done, and kept feeding money into the system. Like too many cups of coffee, instead of energising the system it just caused headaches (and further headaches in the 1980s, when the coffee was suddenly removed).</p> <p>The high-inflation mistakes of the 1970s have been pretty well picked over by economists - economic journals and textbooks are littered with little \"lest we forget\" reminders of those mistakes - so the Treasury and Bank of England probably can be trusted not to make the same mistake again. They'll have new mistakes of their own to make.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, today threatened to pull out of a power-sharing deal after the country's president, Robert Mugabe, unilaterally announced he had taken control of all major cabinet posts, including those responsible for the military and police.</p> <p>South Africa's former president, Thabo Mbeki, is expected in Harare tomorrow to try and rescue the agreement he brokered, under which Tsvangirai is appointed prime minister and Mugabe remains president but with far few powers than before.<br> Tsvangirai told a rally in Harare today that he would not be pressured by Mugabe into joining an administration dominated by the president's Zanu-PF party when the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won the last reputable elections in March. </p> <p>\"If they do it that way, we have no right to be part of such an arrangement,\" said Tsvangirai. \"The people have suffered. But if it means suffering the more in order for them to get what is at stake, then so be it. We will renegotiate until an agreement is reached but that does not mean we will compromise for the sake of it.\"</p> <p>Mugabe announced the appointment of new cabinet posts this weekend, allocating his party jurisdiction over the various security and intelligence forces as well as the justice portfolio and the information ministry, which has control over Zimbabwe's highly partisan pro-Mugabe state newspapers and broadcasters.</p> <p>The MDC described the move as a \"giant act of madness which puts the whole deal into jeopardy\" and as a ploy to pre-empt Mbeki's visit to unblock the logjam over the distribution of ministries. </p> <p>\"The elite in Zanu-PF is not interested in addressing the current challenges in the country. Instead, they are obsessed with power retention at all costs,\" Tsvangirai's party said.</p> <p>The MDC says it will agree to Zanu-PF having authority over the military but that Tsvangirai must control home affairs, which oversees the police, and the justice ministry. That is important to Tsvangirai to ensure that Zanu-PF does not repeat its violent campaign at the next election.</p> <p>Mugabe's move is a demonstration of his power to obstruct the political deal he described as \"humiliating\" after he was forced to sign it last month. But the Zimbabwean president's overall position remains weak.</p> <p>There will be no foreign aid to rescue an economy collapsing under hyperinflation - officially put at 231 million percent but which in reality runs into the trillions - without Tsvangirai wielding real authority at the head of a genuine power sharing government. </p> <p>Mugabe only signed the political agreement with the opposition because his administration has no solutions to the economic crisis. Thus, while he can block implementation of the deal, and keep control of the government, he will be left facing even deeper problems than when he was forced into the deal.<br> Neither can Mugabe count on Mbeki to protect him after a change of administration in South Africa. Although Mbeki remains the mediator, South Africa's new president, Kgalema Montlanthe, and those around him are hostile to Mugabe and there is a growing mood inside the new government to confront Zimbabwe's leader.</p>",
  "<p>The Colombian government is very, very keen for you to come and spend your time and money here. This week in capital Bogot\u00e1 as the 25th <a href=\"http://www.bogocine.com/xxv/\">international film festival</a> rolls out across the city's wonderful 1940s art deco picture houses, the tourist board is chasing dollars and euros and pounds.</p> <p>A slick new marketing drive <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxHQO1kXFng&amp;feature=related\">shows</a> Europeans and Americans telling us how they came to visit and just couldn't leave, mingled with footage of the country's spectacular beauty. It ends on the slogan \"Colombia: the only risk is wanting to stay\" \u2013 which while slightly mangled in translation, is as punchy as it is pithy. It is also \u2013 at least if you're a tourist \u2013true.</p> <p>At a launch in London for the marketing campaign recently, I almost spat out my <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicharr%C3%B3n\"> chicharron</a> in surprise when a friend who lives on the country's pristine Caribbean coast appeared on screen as the promo video rolled. </p> <p>Johannes, a scuba instructor, came to Colombia from Belgium five years ago and made his home in Santa Marta. He smiled at the camera and said the slogan like he meant it. It turns out everyone else on the video is real, too, and their stories all check out. </p> <p>Third-division travel journalism is littered with the phrase: \"XXX \u2013 Land of contrasts\". But Colombia is more like a land of opposites. In the country that popularised <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism\">magic realism</a>, that shouldn't be a surprise. Nothing is as you expect it to be here. Every perception that you may have of the place is confounded the more you travel about. </p> <p>The people were recently voted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/7487143.stm\">third-happiest</a> on earth. That the Colombians have kept their sense of humour when poverty, warfare, narcotrafficking and ultra-violence have benighted the place for so long beggars belief. But somehow, they have. Even in Bogot\u00e1, where the elegant, educated locals, or cachacos, are renowned as the country's most reserved bunch, strangers greet each other with courtesy, joke easily, and swap pleasantries. </p> <p>The country is still in thrall to President Alvaro Uribe, the ultra-popular right-wing Washington favourite who has driven the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia\">Farc</a> guerrilla force out of the cities and into the jungles and plains, far from the tourist areas. </p> <p>The cinematic, bloodless rescue of French-Columbian presidential candidate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8Dngrid_Betancourt\">Ingrid Betancourt</a> in July after more than six years of jungle imprisonment by the Farc crowned a stellar year for Uribe, who has overseen a massive increase in foreign direct investment, tourism and economic growth in Colombia. </p> <p>While his human rights record is rightly questioned by many, critics cannot deny his government's success in ravaging Latin America's oldest leftist insurgency. From a 17,000-strong army able to shut down major highways and spread terror in urban centres with car-bombs and kidnapping, the Farc now has just 9,000 soldiers and is widely unpopular. And in 2008, the rebels have lost their three top commanders, and hundreds have taken the bait of government rewards and deserted. </p> <p>Ten years ago, you couldn't drive to the seaside in Colombia without hitting a Farc roadblock. Now, the guerrillas are battered, bruised and bleeding in the jungles, their populist \u2013 and necessary \u2013 cause of land reform and wealth distribution tainted by their undeniable links to the drugs trade, and their use of extortion and kidnapping. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the idyllic Caribbean beaches of Parque Tayrona and Santa Marta are rammed with laughing locals and tourists: in 2007, 2.1m tourists visited Colombia \u2013 up from 830,000 in 2005. </p> <p>Life has got better here, the majority of Colombians say, thanks to Uribe's military offensive. However, it's a campaign waged with Washington's dollars \u2013 $6bn of them since 1999 \u2013 under Plan Colombia, a controversial military aid programme which also attacks the coca trade (many campesinos' only means of survival). </p> <p>Colombia in 2008 is not perfect; life has not improved for the millions of rural poor still caught up in the struggle between the guerrilla, the ill-famed army and the murderous paramilitary groups. Trade unionists are still targeted by death squads with impunity. </p> <p>This is not a place where black-and-white certainties hold true; there are few purely good guys or bad guys here. But just five years ago, fearful tourists dodged Colombia. It's time that changed. If you want to help Colombians escape the grinding cycle of poverty and warfare, the best thing you can do is to put ideology, fear and prejudice to one side, visit here and spend your money.</p> <p><em>This article was edited on October the 13th, 12:40.</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> was today holding key talks with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">European</a> officials desperate to prevent a continent-wide meltdown in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/banking\">banking sector</a> when the markets reopen tomorrow.</p> <p>The prime minister, who has travelled to Paris for the negotiations, wants the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> to adopt a plan along the lines of his \u00a3500bn banking system bail-out, announced last week. </p> <p>But he now believes the government could end up having to take seats on the boards of rescued banks to keep control of bosses' pay and bonuses.</p> <p>Brown said the next few days would be critical as the world tried to drag itself back from the financial brink after Friday's stock market panic wiped \u00a32.7 trillion off global share values.</p> <p>\"The decisions that we take now will not just affect what happens in the next week or two but what happens in the next year or two,\" he told the Observer. </p> <p>He was backed by the International Monetary Fund chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who warned that the world was looking at a \"systemic financial meltdown\" if countries did not push through coordinated action to ease the current crisis.</p> <p>World leaders are keen to see major economies adopt similar plans to re-capitalise banks and guarantee interbank lending for fear that panic selling in the stock market will move to those countries with the weakest banks. </p> <p>While Brown wants the rest of the EU to follow Britain's lead in offering to recapitalise stricken banks and provide funding and state guarantees for their money market operations, not all eurozone leaders are enthusiastic.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has already shown that she is set against a common eurozone plan because she does not want Germany, as the zone's biggest economy, to have to pay the lion's share of it. </p> <p>Merkel is due to unveil her own plan for capital injections into German banks today, and a government guarantee of savings and lending between banks that could cost as much as \u20ac400bn.</p> <p>Italy is negotiating a similar plan, although France has proved less concerned about its own banks. </p> <p>The Financial Stability Forum, in Washington, has forecast a future for banks as one of more capital, less risk and lower profits as a result of much tighter regulation. </p> <p>The prediction came as the UK continued to thrash out details of its own bail-out plan with bank leaders today.</p> <p>The Treasury is believed to be looking at taking stakes in Britain's leading banks, giving it more control over their business and even representation on boards.</p> <p>Last week, Treasury officials made \u00a325bn of public money available for the country's eight largest banks and another \u00a325bn in reserve in case other banks needed more.</p> <p>But the indications today were that the biggest four banks would now require \u00a335bn alone, such is the battered state of their balance sheets after the recent weeks of turmoil in the markets. </p> <p>Halifax Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland are likely to take the majority of that money, with the government becoming the majority shareholder in both.</p> <p>If that is the case, the liabilities of both banks will almost certainly have to appear on the public finances, pushing the national debt hugely higher in the same way Northern Rock did.</p> <p>Yesterday, Treasury officials said they had held constructive talks with their counterparts in the Icelandic capital, Reykjavik, over British deposits held in the collapsed Icesave bank. </p> <p>They said the Icelanic government had agreed in principle to accelerate payouts to retail depositors. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, today called for tax cuts to help hard-pressed families through the financial crisis. </p> <p>\"It's time for the government to help the millions of struggling families, not just the banks,\" he said. \"Low and middle-income families need tax cuts now to help them through the recession. </p> <p>\"These could be funded by simple measures to crack down on tax avoidance and by making the system fairer.\"</p>",

He added that the bodies of another 20 fighters had been carried from the battle site by militants.</p> <p>Taliban fighters have traditionally relied more on suicide bombings and roadside bombs in their campaign in Helmand. </p> <p>The MOD spokesman said that if today's attack represented a departure from the insurgents' usual tactics, it was an approach that had \"failed miserably\".</p> <p>Afghan officials also said troops had retaken the Nad Ali district of Helmand after a three-day battle. </p> <p>Ahmadi said the fight, which also involved airstrikes, had ended on Saturday, adding that Afghan security forces were now in control of the district centre. </p> <p>There were no casualties among Afghan or NATO troops.</p> <p>The death tolls could not be verified independently. The Nato-led force said it was aware of fighting in Helmand but could not provide any information.</p> <p>Helmand is the largest drug-producing area in the world, accounting for more than half of Afghanistan's production of opium poppies. </p> <p>More than 90%of the world's opium is produced in Afghanistan, and millions of dollars of the profits from the trade are used to finance the Taliban insurgency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a roadside bomb detonated by a civilian vehicle in the Shamulzai district of Zabul province on Sunday, killing five people, a provincial official said.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a> personally intervened to secure an exemption for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> from a tobacco advertising ban just hours after meeting the sport's boss, Bernie Ecclestone, according to Whitehall documents.</p> <p>Previously secret papers, obtained by the Sunday Telegraph, show that the former prime minister personally intervened in pushing for the exemption hours after meeting the formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone. </p> <p>The incident, in the first few months of Blair's premiership, became known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">New Labour</a>'s first sleaze scandal. </p> <p>The government has always maintained that Blair's meeting did not influence the final decision over the exemption, even though Ecclestone was a major donor to the Labour party. </p> <p>At the time, Blair denied any personal involvement in the issue, appearing on the BBC's On the Record programme to insist he was a \"pretty straight kind of guy\". </p> <p>But briefing notes prepared by officials - obtained by the Sunday Telegraph under freedom of information laws - raise questions about his account.</p> <p>They reportedly show that he instructed his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, to signal his support for an exemption after meeting Ecclestone on October 16 1997.</p> <p>The following day, Downing Street wrote to Tessa Jowell, then the public health minister, stating: \"The prime minister would like your ministers to look for ways of finding a permanent derogation for sport, in particular F1.\"</p> <p>On October 24, Jowell wrote to Blair setting out possible options including an exemption as well as a suggestion for a longer phasing-in period for the ban.</p> <p>However, five days later, she received a letter insisting: \"His (the prime minister's) view remains that we should seek to negotiate a permanent exemption for Formula One, backed up by a voluntary agreement with the FIA.\"</p> <p>Jowell then wrote to the EU - where the tobacco advertising legislation was being drafted - seeking a total exemption for formula one.</p> <p>The documents also reveal concern among Whitehall officials that they were at risk of being \"disingenuous\" about the situation.</p> <p>John Maples, the Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon, had tabled a parliamentary question asking on which date Blair had informed the health secretary, Frank Dobson, of the decision to push for an exemption.</p> <p>A reply, which gave the date as October 29, was drafted, but a briefing note warned: \"The draft reply is strictly true in terms of the final decision which resulted in the letter to EU colleagues and is consistent with the prime minister's references on On the Record to the decision having been taken two or three weeks after the meeting (with) the FIA on 16 October.</p> <p>\"However, if the correspondence were in the public domain, critics could argue that the answer was disingenuous in that the prime minister's views had been clearly conveyed by the telephone call on October 16 and the letter on October 17.\"</p> <p>Before the question had been answered, Blair told the Commons that the decision to exempt formula one had been made on November 5.</p> <p>When the answer to Maples' question was finally given, it referred him to Blair's statement.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \"These revelations blow the lid off what looks to have been a culture of deceit in Downing Street under Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"Mr Blair assured us at the time that there was no deception and if, as is now thought, this claim was untrue, Mr Blair has some serious questions to answer.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Blair yesterday said: \"There is nothing new here. All these issues were debated at the time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Coming at the end of a week of turmoil for private capital, the news that Amey plc, a major services consultancy and sponsor of the Unity city academy in Middlesbrough is in talks regarding the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7663484.stm\">dissolution</a>\" of its sponsorship lays bare some of the key problems with giving private companies a controlling stake in our public services.</p> <p>Much of the criticism of the academy model has focused rightly on their undemocratic makeup. But as the troubled history of Unity shows, there is little tangible proof that they work, certainly not in the long term.</p> <p>Since its opening in 2002, Unity has struggled with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/20/politics.schools\">poor results</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jun/03/schools.education\">staff discontent</a> and discipline issues. In its first two years, it was criticised for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/4113655.stm\">expelling</a> large numbers of disruptive pupils. Despite a positive Ofsted report last month, only 12% of its pupils got five good GCSEs, including English and maths, this year.</p> <p>Of course, like many poorly performing local schools, Unity is dealing with a disproportionately disadvantaged intake. The trouble is, bringing in outside sponsors does not address any of the deeper structural problems, such as the effect of selection on many local schools. The new leaders often have little knowledge of how schools actually work. And, unlike the much-maligned local authorities, private sponsors can simply jump ship when things don't work out. As we now see.</p> <p>We don't know yet why Amey wants to pull out of Unity. It may be something to do with the recent market turmoil, another good reason not to let commercial bodies take direct charge of our children's education.</p> <p>Some say it is connected to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/06/newschools.schools\">transfer</a> earlier this week of Lord Adonis, the leading academies champion, from the Department for Children, Schools and Families into transport. Opposition parties were quick to jump on this as a sign that the government is stalling on, even \"strangling\", its flagship policy. Of course, it is possible that Adonis himself requested, or at least sanctioned, the move.</p> <p>Either way, this week may come to be seen as a turning point in the story of this controversial educational experiment. The existing academies have not just lost their biggest political supporter within the government; Adonis apparently also played a highly active brokering role in the establishment of many of the new schools. Without him there, sponsors' enthusiasm, already dented by the loans-for-peerages scandal and now surely further eroded by the recent market collapse, might just drain away.</p> <p>Let's hope that some of the strong political, and local, arguments against academies will now get a wider hearing in both the government and the media. As I write, protesters from Sheffield to Camden and from Bolton to Barrow are taking a stand against the setting up of academy schools in their areas.</p> <p>These campaigners are not against high-quality schools in deprived urban areas. They too want new buildings, greater freedom for teachers and heads, better teaching and learning and more innovation in the curriculum. But they want links to the community maintained and strengthened, and the local authority given a supervisory role in key questions like fair admissions. This means the revelation by the chief adjudicator on school admissions, Philip Hunter, that an astonishing half of state schools are still in breach of new rules designed to protect fairness is potentially far more significant than the news about a failed individual sponsor.</p> <p>The government's belief in the apparently magic powers of private ownership and control was bound to come unstuck sooner or later. In this week of all weeks, maybe New Labour will finally rediscover a belief in the benign powers of the state, particularly in the running of our precious public services.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/bluemandy/2817332670/\">Homeless near Venice Beach</a> by <a href=\"http://flickr.com/people/bluemandy/\">Lewisha Jones</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en\">Some Rights Reserved</a></p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/12/uselections2008-useconomy\">I said in my last post</a>, here in southern California, apart from communities like Riverside hard hit by the housing crisis, it's not immediately apparent the economy is on the rocks. Homelessness is a chronic problem in the US. I lived in Washington DC for almost seven years, and you'll see people sleeping in many areas of downtown and even near the White House.</p> <p>Joel John Roberts is the CEO of the housing development organisation <a href=\"http://www.pathpartners.org\">PATH Partners,</a> and he also writes the <a href=\"http://www.lahomelessblog.org\">LA Homeless blog</a>. The federal government says that homelessness is down, but he says that all you have to do is <a href=\"http://www.lahomelessblog.org/2008/10/world-watches-growth-of-american-tent.html\">read local newspapers across the US</a> to realise that the economic crisis is driving people onto the streets and into new tent cities and shanty towns.</p> <p>The rise in foreclosures and a rise in homelessness could affect the election because Republicans have moved to challenge voters who are registered at the addresses of foreclosed homes. </p> <p>Joel said that many of the homeless of LA are hidden. They disappear along the freeways, under bridges, bushes and in parks. It's difficult for him to estimate whether the homeless organisation that he heads is seeing an increase in homelessness. \"We're always maxed out,\" he says.</p> <p>Nationally, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5htD-5rvP6yK7RZ008IAiqfAI5ZGgD9398LEG0\">61 percent of local and state homeless coalitions say they've seen a rise</a> in homelessness since the foreclosure crisis began in 2007, according to a report by the National Coalition for the Homeless.</p> <p>About 1% of the US population is homeless, in a large urban county like Los Angeles that means tens of thousands of people. The US government has targeted chronic homelessness, spending more than a billion dollars to reduce chronic homelessness by 15-20%. In 2005, the US government counted 80,000 homeless people in a three-day count in Los Angeles County, and two years later, they found 72,000. Joel calls this a \"homeless numbers game\" and said that government had just perfected their counting. Even with the reduced number, there are only 15,000 shelter beds in LA. And that count was last year before the housing crisis really gathered steam. </p> <p>The count is also might misrepresent the problem of homelessness. Social services departments in LA say about 225,000 people say they were homeless at one point in time over the last year.</p> <p>\"To me, it's very disgusting to be a part of a country that allows this. I get angry when political people tell me that it's getting better. I see people losing homes right and left,\" he said.</p> <p>However, most people who have lost their homes to foreclosure are not ending up on the streets, Joel said. Most of them are returning to the rental market. What he worries is that affordable housing has not kept pace with demand in the Los Angeles area. If large numbers of people are forced back onto the rental market, it might cause prices to increase, which would force people at the lower end of the market into homelessness.</p> <p>Banks loaned money to people who couldn't afford their mortgages in the first place, he said. In late 2006, some families with sub-prime mortgages <a href=\"http://www.thislife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355\">defaulted on their loans without ever making a payment</a>. He advocates taking foreclosed homes and turning them into affordable housing.</p> <p><strong>A rise in tent cities</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-vergara5-2008oct05,0,5231600.story\">Shanty towns have existed for decades</a> in American cities, but with anxiety about the economy, people are watching to see if large scale camps develop like the 1930s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooverville\">Hoovervilles</a>, named after President Herbert Hoover who was blamed for causing the Great Depression.</p> <p>Joel says that while shanty towns may have existed in US cities that his monitoring of local media across the country shows a spike in stories about them. \"I don't buy the political perspective that homelessness is getting better when local papers are writing about more tent cities around,\" he said.</p> <p>In Reno Nevada, joblessness has jumped 60% and a tent city of 170 people grew. <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_10660008\">Reno is trying to shut down the tent city</a> and move people to newly opened shelters. CBS News has reported <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/01/eveningnews/main4493104.shtml\">tent cities in Seattle, Portland, Fresno, Columbus, and Chattanooga.</a> There are also reports of encampments in <a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/382847_nickelsville11.html?source=mypi\">Seattle</a>, San Diego, and Columbus, Ohio, Santa Barbara and Fresno California.</p> <p><strong>How does this impact the election?</strong></p> <p>The chronic homeless usually don't vote. They have no fixed address to register. Some states such as <a href=\"http://www.daytondailynews.com/n/content/oh/story/news/local/2008/10/09/ddn100908voting.html\">Ohio have tried to help homeless to vote,</a> but Republicans challenged the voter registration drive even though the law that allowed it was passed by the Republican-controlled Ohio legislature in 2006.</p> <p>The wave of foreclosures, which in some areas of the country disproportionately affect black voters, could also come into play. The Republican Party of Macomb County Michigan, one of three counties that make up Detroit, is planning to use list of <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/12/politics/animal/main4443434.shtml\">foreclosed homes to challenge people</a> who try to vote using those addresses.</p> <p>Republicans claim that they are trying to prevent voter fraud. Homeless and voting rights advocates are trying to make sure that people don't <a href=\"http://www.lahomelessblog.org/2008/10/voting-foreclosures-and-homelessness.html\">lose their homes and their right to vote</a>.</p> <p>Technorati Tags: <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/politics\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">politics</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/US\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">US</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/elections\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">elections</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/economy\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">economy</a> <a href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/homelessness\" rel=\"tag\" class=\"techtag\">homelessness</a></p>"
