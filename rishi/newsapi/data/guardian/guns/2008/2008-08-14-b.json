  "<p>To their hot-blooded fans, the Dandy Warhols are dizzyingly inventive alternative-rock heroes. To the rest of the western world, they are the arrogant stars of rock documentaries and Vodafone adverts, and their achingly dull eighth album does little to alter that assessment. It starts with The World the People Together (Come On), a totally vague stadium anthem that has no heart or spine. Then things go downhill. Mission Control sounds like Marilyn Manson on an off day, Valerie Yum sounds like a post-lobotomy Super Furry Animals, and the lumpen funk of Welcome to the Third World is built around the lyric \"You dance pretty good for an almost white girl\", one of the band's many terrible attempts at hilarity. Mark Knopfler's weary guitar on Love Song is telling - revealing that a band who claim to offer more are actually content to peddle MOR.</p>",
  "<p>Guitarist Wolfgang Muthspiel enjoys a fittingly world-class regular partnership with Wayne Shorter's drummer, Brian Blade. This joint audio/DVD package features their duo caught live in Muthspiel's native Austria. Though no clone, Muthspiel has been compared with Pat Metheny and John Scofield. But lately he's broadened his world music horizons, and this all-original set includes a dancing, chanting dedication to singer/percussionist Youssou N'Dour - unleashing the full Blade works on shakers, water-trickling sounds and speeding tom-tom patterns, and a free-rolling guitar improvisation over the looped original melody. Muthspiel's resourceful mingling of electronic and acoustic sounds and improviser's imagination allows Blade (the most melodious of drummers) to stretch out over changing backdrops, and there are two lovely ballads. A train-rhythm blues chugs over Blade's soft rumbles and admonishing snaps on Between the Beats, and Muthspiel the postbop swinger (taut and darkly McLaughlinesque behind the driving drums) hurtles through the finale of the grooving End On 4. You have to check the credits to remind yourself there are only two of them. <br></p>",
  "<p>1. Madonna's \"Confessions ...\" tour was the highest-grossing tour by a female artist. In your face, Lisa Scott-Lee.</p> <p>2. Madonna was only inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year because the Hall of Fame requires a minimum career length of 25 years. Therefore, we still have a while to wait until the Hall of Fame is able to recognise the genius of Gary Lightbody, Roy from Scouting for Girls or Shaggy. Perhaps it is time they looked at making a few exceptions for these titans of popular song.</p> <p>3. Madonna likes clothes. Madonna also likes money. Happily, she has found a way to combine these two passions, having appeared in advertisements for Gap - with Missy Elliott - and H&amp;M, for whom she designed (\"designed\") a range of clothes.</p> <p>4. During the course of their training all local TV news reporters and tabloid journalists are coached in referring to Madonna as \"The Material Girl\" at least twice every 18 months. This is in reference to Madonna's hit single Material Girl.</p> <p>5. According to her brother Christopher, the only thing Madonna can cook is Rice Krispie cakes. This means that dishes she is incapable of serving up include La Isla Bolognese, Dear Jelly, Hanky Lamb Shanky, Don't Cry for Me Polenta, and Crazy for Yule Log.</p> <p>6. People call her Madge, although not to her face.</p> <p>7. Felix Howard, the fresh-faced 13-year-old in the Open Your Heart video, is now a music business bigwig and has written songs for artists including Amy Winehouse, Kylie Minogue and Sugababes.</p> <p>8. Like A Virgin was originally written for a MAN. Disgusting.</p> <p>9. Artists to have sung songs about Madonna include Robbie Williams (the Pet Shop Boys collaboration She's Madonna was the best song on Rudebox, whatever that counts for), Sparks (\"Madonna\" tells the story of a late night cab right with The Madgster) and the Androids (Do It With Madonna is about rumpo). Madonna is also referenced in Sophie Ellis-Bextor's New York City Lights: \"Madonna says it's true, the town gets hold of you\". Quite a good line.</p> <p>10. It's a myth that Madonna went to Times Square with only $35 and some ballet shoes, according \u2013 once again! - to her brother. Apparently, she went there with money and loads of contacts, although if you're going to have a go at a master manipulator like Madonna for rewriting her own past then you might as well go around shouting at cows for mooing and shooting milk out of their tits.</p> <p>11. The best Madonna headline ever to have appeared in the popular press was Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies, although for that to make any sort of sense you need to know that it was just after she fell off a horse, and even then you'd still be confused if you weren't familiar with British 80s sitcom Allo Allo. You had to be there, etc.</p> <p>12. Madonna has performed at Live 8, Live Aid and Live Earth, although somehow the world is STILL plagued by hunger and poverty and the environment STILL looks like it is all going tits up. The looming inevitability of the latter catastrophe is all the more surprising given that Madonna actually wrote a new song, Hey You, for Live Earth. Clearly, \"the environment\" is no fan of good music.</p> <p>13. Betty Boo tells an amusing story about Madonna giving her one of her jackets. Madonna was quite keen on Betty Boo at one point in the 1990s, describing her as \"criminally overlooked\" and attempting to sign the cat-headed songstress to her Maverick label.</p> <p>14. Other artists to have been signed to Maverick include Alanis, the Prodigy, Mirwais, and a load of people you have never heard of.</p> <p>15. Norwegian songbird Annie sampled Madonna's Everybody on her debut single, Greatest Hit. Establishing a pattern that continues to plague Annie's career in 2008, the song was not in fact a great hit at all, but was very good indeed.</p> <p>16. Madonna reportedly turned down Prince when he asked her to take the female lead in his Graffiti Bridge movie, because the screenplay was awful. To give you an idea of how bad she thought the screenplay was, films Madonna said yes to include Shanghai Surprise, Swept Away, Dick Tracy, Body of Evidence and The Next Best Thing. She has received Razzie awards for Worst Actress (several times) and Worst Supporting Actress (twice), also being half responsible for winning Worst Screen Couple (twice), and, in 2000, Worst Actress of the Century.</p> <p>17. Madonna has scored 64 (SIXTY FOUR) UK Top 40 hits. That will be a flash, but probably quite expensive, box set when Warners put it out in time for Christmas now that Madge has pissed off to Live Nation.</p> <p>18. Like a Virgin has made a huge impact on British popular culture, and for evidence of this we need only direct our attention toward the Okey Cokey Karaoke episode of sitcom Birds of a Feather in which comedic nymphomaniac Dorien sings the song in a nightclub. It's testament to this set piece's earth shattering amazingness that the directors of the half-hour sitcom opted to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyqLWrNfWN8\">include the song from beginning to end</a>. </p> <p>19. At the UK media playback for Confessions on a Dance Floor there were Madonna-branded DJ slipmats. Very clever. Dance floor. DJs. Decks.</p> <p>20. At the UK media playback session for Hard Candy there was a massive mosaic of the album's sleeve, made out of Jelly Belly sweets. Very clever. Candy. Candy.</p> <p>21. Also at the Hard Candy playback was an ocean of free booze which, with hindsight, may go some way to explaining the largely glowing reviews of what, in the cold light of day, turned out to be a deeply underwhelming album that has alienated even some of the singer's hardcore fans. Many of these fans still admire Madonna's continued hunger for success, but feel that in chasing the popular music style of the day rather than setting her own agenda she has, for perhaps the first time, begun to show her age.</p> <p>22. Her age, incidentally, is 50. Hence these 50 amazing facts. Other singers to be 50 this year include Michael Jackson, Prince, Kate Bush and Ice-T. If one were to put them in order of who had grown old the most gracefully, Madonna would be slap bang in the middle.</p> <p>23. Other dishes Madonna cannot cook include Another Fruitcake in Another Hall, Take a Bowl of Porridge, Who's That Grill and What it Feels Like for a Viennese Whirl.</p> <p>24. Madonna's wealth is estimated to be well in excess of $400m, although you can expect this to rocket when the Hard Candy \"millions\" start rolling in.</p> <p>25. During the recording of Hard Candy one of the album's producers, Pharrell Williams, made Madonna cry \"like a baby\".</p> <p>26. It can be stated without any waiting or hesitating that Madonna is not the world's greatest lyricist, although her words do have \"a certain charm\". Her best lyrics are on the Like a Virgin album, but she didn't really write those, except for album track Shoo-Bee-Doo. (Oh dear.)</p> <p>27. Madonna once noted: \"I want to be like Gandhi and Martin Luther King and John Lennon - but I want to stay alive.\"</p> <p>28. A song Madonna quite likes is the Todd Terry remix of Everything But the Girl's Missing.</p> <p>29. The Babyface-produced single Take a Bow remains Madonna's longest-running No 1 single in America \u2013 it topped the charts for seven weeks, but in the UK the ballad ended a 10-year run of consecutive Top 10 singles when it wound up at No 16 around Christmas in 1995. Shouldn't have chucked in some sleigh bells.</p> <p>30. Madonna has had a single in the UK Top 40 every year except 1988, 2004 and 2007. After these \"breaks\" she returned with Like a Prayer in 1989 (amazing), Hung Up in 2005 (amazing) and 4 Minutes in 2008 (sort of amazing).</p> <p>31. Vogue was originally going to be a B-side because Madonna didn't think it would be strong enough to be released as a single.</p> <p>32. Madonna is the best-selling female artist of all time, but you probably could have guessed that.</p> <p>33. Madonna gave her song Love Won't Wait to Gary Barlow for his second solo single which, despite being absolutely terrible, became a No 1 hit single. Madonna's version remains unreleased \u2026</p> <p>34. Film soundtracks on which Madonna appears include Die Another Day, At Close Range, With Honours, The Next Best Thing, A League of Their Own, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and various others.</p> <p>35. American Pie, from The Next Best Thing, is actually brilliant. Although you cannot buy it on iTunes, for some reason.</p> <p>36. In 1982, as Everybody was proving \"big in the clubs\", Madonna auditioned for Fame but didn't get the part of Leroy.</p> <p>37. Madonna's first band was called The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>38. 4 Minutes is actually four minutes and four seconds long \u2013 a disastrous misfire which could have been remedied if Timbaland had increased the song's speed by just one beat per minute.</p> <p>39. Madonna lost her virginity in the back of a Cadillac, later explaining that she saw it as a career move.</p> <p>40. Madonna once stated that she thought her Dick Tracy album I'm Breathless was her best because it was \"different\".</p> <p>41. Ingredients Madonna does not have in her kitchen \u2013 because she cannot cook \u2013 include Cumin Nature, Bedthyme Story, and This Used to Be My Playground Nutmeg.</p> <p>42. The Immaculate Collection is one of the best titles of a greatest hits album in the history of pop.</p> <p>43. It is certainly better than GHV2.</p> <p>44. Earlier this month Madonna's was named the \"ultimate face\" in a New Yorker feature on plastic surgery, with surgeons explaining that hers is one of clients' most sought-after \"visages\".</p> <p>45. Men to have recorded cover versions of Madonna songs include Marilyn Manson (Justify My Love), Marc Almond (Like A Prayer), KMFDM (Material Girl) and Teenage Fanclub (Like a Virgin).</p> <p>46. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Madonna at No 36 in their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time poll. Not bad for a girl, right lads?</p> <p>47. True Blue remains Madonna's most successful album, shifting 24m units.</p> <p>48. Madonna's family own a vineyard in Michigan where one can purchase limited-edition Madonna wine.</p> <p>49. Supernatural, the B-side to Cherish, is about a ghost who has sex with Madonna.</p> <p>50. Back to the cooking, though. Because she cannot cook very well she probably eats a lot of biscuits. One can imagine her emerging from a kitchen brandishing a plate containing including a Bourbonline and a Guy Richtea. Maybe there would be a choc ice, too, but she'd bring that out later because it's Frozen. She is certainly not a True Cordon Bleu. You might even (That's quite enough of that \u2013 Ed)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2008/jul/30/madonna.popandrock?picture=336082414\"><em>See a picture for every year Madonna's been alive!</em></a></p>",
  "<h2>Vale to spend 5bn on new Amazonian mill</h2> <p>Vale will spend $5bn (\u00a32.7bn) on a new steel mill complex and related operations in the Amazon state of Para, Brazil. The mill will produce 2.5m tonnes a year when it begins production in 2013 and expand to 5m tonnes, the Brazilian mining company said. Vale estimates construction costs at about $3.3bn. The company said that it will also spend $900m on a 600-megawatt plant in Barcarena to power the mill, in addition to other investments in operations and environmental and social programmes. It will be the first steel mill that Vale operates without an outside partner. <br><strong>Associated Press</strong></p> <h2>Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan pay $60m in fines</h2> <p>Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan have become the latest Wall Street financial groups to accept fines and promise to buy-back frozen bonds once sold as safe investments. The two have reached a deal with the New York attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, to pay fines totalling $60m. They will also repurchase \"auction-rate securities\" worth billions from investors. Last week UBS and Citigroup agreed to buy back $26bn in securities and pay fines of $250m; Merrill Lynch has offered to buy back up to $12bn. Such securities became impossible to sell when the market froze in February. <br><strong>Julia Finch</strong></p> <h2>Rolls-Royce plans joint venture with US firm</h2> <p>Rolls-Royce is planning a joint venture with Goodrich, the US aerospace systems supplier, to develop and supply engine controls. It would combine Goodrich's British engine control design and manufacturing business and Rolls-Royce's expertise in integrating control systems. The Goodrich operations employ around 1,100 in Birmingham and Belfast and the joint venture will involve up to 500 Rolls-Royce employees at Bristol, Derby, Dahlewitz in Germany and in Indianapolis in the US. Negotiations with employee representatives are expected to take place shortly. <br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>BP blames partners after Russia bans Dudley</h2> <p>The divisions between the warring factions at TNK-BP deepened yesterday after its chief executive, Robert Dudley, was reportedly banned from working in Russia for two years for breaching labour laws. BP said it was \"very disappointed\" by the decision and that Dudley would remain chief executive pending the outcome of an appeal. The company claimed the decision was a further example of what it called administrative activity orchestrated by the other shareholders, a consortium of Russian billionaires. Dudley has already left Russia but continues to run the company from abroad. <br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>Lower margins push down npower profits</h2> <p>German utility RWE said operating profits from its UK energy business, npower, fell 3% in the first half of the year after adjusting for currency movements. The decline came on the back of lower margins in npower's retail arm, which supplies energy to homes and businesses across Britain. Group first-half revenues were up 13% to \u20ac24.7bn, though operating profits fell 8% to \u20ac3.9bn as energy trading failed to match last year's record results. RWE said the outlook for full-year earnings prospects was positive and it expected to at least match last year's operating performance. <br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p>",
  "<p>Lewis Altman, who has died aged 90, was the stockbroker who, in the words of a senior London Stock Exchange official, \"tweaked the council's nose too often\". Extremely able but abrasive, the secretive Altman was anti-establishment, with colourful clients and a penchant for transactions that outwitted bigger rivals and tested regulators. He was also prepared to challenge the then all-powerful council - obtaining an unprecedented high court injunction on one occasion to prevent disciplinary action being taken.</p> <p>Altman also upset many in the exchange's hierarchy by supporting the admission of women as members. In 1973, his long-time personal and business partner Anne Hall\u00e9, who died last year, was among the first to join.</p> <p>Altman became a major trader in far eastern tin and rubber shares, often buying and selling control of British-owned mines and plantations to local Chinese interests. He was an expert in guanxi - the complex network of personal relationships and favours that still dictates a lot of Chinese business. </p> <p>But involvement in a major currency scandal resulted in Altman's expulsion from Stock Exchange membership after three decades, in 1978. He and his firm, Lewis Altman &amp; Co, were convicted of breaching exchange control regulations in the biggest prosecution of its kind.</p> <p>This system, introduced in 1947 and ended in 1979 by the Thatcher government, required UK-resident purchasers of foreign shares to buy investment dollars at a premium above the official exchange rate. On sale, 75% of that investment dollar premium was repaid. During the early 70s, with the dollar premium high, \"premium stripping\" - obtaining reimbursement of inflated or even unpaid premiums - became a costly scam for Britain's foreign exchange reserves.</p> <p>In February 1977, Altman, his firm and others were charged with conspiracy and breaches of the Exchange Control Act. Circular transactions totalling \u00a36.7m between November 1974 and May 1975 generated profits of \u00a32m - worth \u00a312m today - by reclaiming premiums that had never been paid. Altman's firm handled the currency deals, and the money disappeared into bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The mastermind behind the scheme was said in court to have been one of Altman's biggest clients, a former London solicitor, Judah Binstock. He lived on the continent and was never tried.</p> <p>In April 1978, Altman was fined \u00a354,700 and his firm \u00a3155,500. Fines of just over \u00a31m were imposed on two companies involved in the fraud. \"Altman knew that Binstock was the puppet-owner pulling the strings of the corporate marionettes,\" stated the Guildhall magistrates' judgment. Altman denied he had known of the fraud. </p> <p>The Stock Exchange refused to accept his resignation and expelled him in September 1978. However, Altman continued to work in the City through a new company, mainly doing business in the far east, for another 10 years until tougher new regulations closed him down once again.</p> <p>The Binstock connection also resulted in Altman featuring in a 1979 report by Department of Trade inspectors into the affairs of the Peachey Property Corporation and its chairman Sir Eric Miller, knighted by the Labour prime minister Harold Wilson. Miller was an Altman client: he shot himself in September 1977, months after the investigation was announced.</p> <p>The inspectors highlighted a \u00a370,000 loan by Peachey in 1972 made via Lewis Altman &amp; Co to an offshore Binstock-controlled company. Altman told the inspectors this had been arranged between Miller and Binstock. Miller had given contradictory explanations. The inspectors accepted Binstock's version that it related to a private transaction with Miller.</p> <p>Altman was born in Stepney, London, the son of a warehouseman whose family had arrived as refugees from Russian pogroms. On leaving school, he went to work in the City at a newly formed firm, Raymond &amp; Bekhor, to which he returned after war service, before forming Lewis Altman &amp; Co in 1954.</p> <p>Altman's influential contacts in the far east started with relationships formed during three years as a Japanese prisoner of war. He had enlisted in the RAF in 1940, and was captured in Bandung, Java - where he was working in the headquarters hospital - in March 1942. Shipped to Singapore, he was imprisoned first at Changi PoW camp, and then, from May to December 1943, in Thailand at various camps on the infamous Burma railway. He was at Changi from May 1944 until it was liberated in August 1945, entertaining fellow prisoners with talks on the stock market. He kept records of deaths and sickness that were handed over to war crimes investigators.</p> <p>In 1945, he married Florence Camp. They were separated, and she died in 2006. He is survived by their daughter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lewis Altman, stockbroker, born November 21 1917; died June 28 2008</p>",
  "<p>The government has been accused of creating laws that have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in the UK in a sharply critical report from the United Nations' committee on human rights. The report calls for the reform of Britain's libel laws and controls introduced under recent terrorism laws.</p> <p>The government's use of the Official Secrets Act to prevent issues of public interest being published is also condemned in an intervention from the UN which warns that public servants are being gagged even where national security is not at risk.</p> <p>The criticisms are made as part of the committee's analysis of a report which the UK is required to submit to the UN every three years, appraising human rights in its jurisdiction. </p> <p>Among the problems identified, the UN says:</p> <p>\u00b7 Terrorism Act 2006 provisions covering encouragement of terrorism are too broad and vague, and should be amended so that their application does not lead to \"a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression\".</p> <p>\u00b7 Libel laws should be reformed to end so-called \"libel tourism\", whereby wealthy foreigners have gone to the high court to sue over articles that would not warrant action in their own country.</p> <p>\u00b7 Powers under the Official Secrets Act have been \"exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest, and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters\".</p> <p>The committee also warns that, in the age of the internet, Britain's unduly restrictive libel laws create the danger of affecting freedom of expression worldwide, contrary to a UN covenant on civil and political rights which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and to exchange ideas and information \"regardless of borders\".</p> <p>On the phenomenon of libel tourism, the case which has provoked most concern is that of the American researcher Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld, who was sued in London by a Saudi businessman and his two sons over a book which was not published in the UK, although 23 copies had been sold here via the internet and one chapter was available online. The action led to the New York state legislature passing legislation to protect writers and publishers working there from defamation judgments elsewhere, unless the defendants enjoyed the same freedom of speech rights as under New York and US federal law. </p> <p>The UK government has been urged to consider \"a so-called 'public figure' exception\", which would require a would-be claimant to prove actual malice by a publisher or author. This would apply in cases involving public officials and prominent public figures, as currently exists in the US, where a public figure can only sue for libel if he or she can demonstrate malice, recklessness or indifference to the truth.</p> <p>The 2006 Terrorism Act's \"broad and vague\" definition of the offence of \"encouragement of terrorism\" - an offence which can attract a jail term of seven years - was also criticised by the committee. </p> <p>\"In particular, a person can commit the offence even when he or she did not intend members of the public to be directly or indirectly encouraged by his or her statement to commit acts of terrorism, but where his or her statement was understood by some members of the public as encouragement to commit such acts,\" concluded the committee.</p> <p>The government's abolition earlier this year of the common-law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel in England and Wales was noted and welcomed, as was the adoption of the civil partnership act recognising unions between gay and lesbian couples.</p> <p>The UK also came under fire for its treatment of the Chagos Islanders, whose case for return to their former homes was heard by the law lords last month. The committee urged that the islanders be allowed to return, and also be compensated.</p> <p>There was also condemnation over the extension of detention without charge from 14 to 28 days under the Terrorism Act. The committee was \"even more disturbed\" at plans to extend this to 42 days.</p> <p>On the issue of the libel laws, media law specialist Mark Stephens said yesterday that \"libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the UN\" .</p> <p>The civil rights organisation, Liberty, has already expressed concern about the Terrorism Act and its potential effect on free expression. \"Free speech has been a victim of the 'war on terror', with offences of 'encouragement' and 'glorification' of terrorism threatening to make careless talk a crime,\" said a spokesperson.</p>",
  "<p>Solange Knowles's self-penned blurb makes exhausting reading. At 22, she can point to parallel careers in singing, acting, songwriting and modelling for sister Beyonc\u00e9's clothing line. But when it comes to star quality, only one family member has it, and it's not Solange.</p> <p>The long-delayed follow-up to her 2003 debut Solo Star, Sol-Angel is savvy R&amp;B with a gloss you can check your reflection in, but it falls short of what she intended: to make the record Dusty Springfield or Minnie Riperton would have made, were they around in 2008. Busy production from Mark Ronson and Pharrell isn't helped by a lack of both memorable tunes and the steely spined ardour that makes Beyonc\u00e9 so compelling.

Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/17/news.culture\">a Vatican ban on the film's makers shooting in two churches</a> - a spokesman for the diocese explained: \"We would be helping them create a work that might well be beautiful but that does not conform to our views\" - the adaptation of Dan Brown's book, filmed on location in Rome, is bang on schedule. \"Beautiful\" or not, you can be sure that Angels and Demons will have the credit: \"A Ron Howard Film\". However, I defy anyone to define what \"A Ron Howard Film\" is, because Howard is the very antithesis of an auteur. </p> <p>Ever since Francois Truffaut coined the phrase \"la politique des auteurs\" in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in 1954, critics have discussed the \"auteur theory\", though it only became fully recognised in America eight years later in an essay by <a href=\"http://www.artandculture.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/ACLive.woa/wa/artist?id=837\">Andrew Sarris</a>. It is an often misused term - for example the \"auteur theory\" does not refer to directors like Jean Renoir, Yasujiro Ozu, Alfred Hitchcock, Carl Dreyer, Luis Bu\u00f1uel, Robert Bresson or Ingmar Bergman, because there is nothing theoretical about their being auteurs. It applied mainly to directors, working as contractees of the Hollywood studios who, nevertheless, revealed a distinctive style and personal vision, for instance, Nicholas Ray and Vincente Minnelli.<br> In 1957, in Art, another magazine for which he was a harsh critic, the 25-year-old Truffaut wrote: \"The film of tomorrow appears to me as even more personal than an individual and autobiographical novel, like a confession, or a diary. The film of tomorrow will not be directed by civil servants of the camera, but by artists for whom shooting a film constitutes a wonderful and thrilling adventure. The film of tomorrow will resemble the person who made it, and the number of spectators will be proportional to the number of friends the director has. The film of tomorrow will be an act of love.\" This was two years before he started to practise what he preached. </p> <p>Ron Howard, one of the most successful Hollywood directors for over 20 years, is a paradigm of the non-auteur, a middle-brow, middle-of-the-road film-maker who adapts his \"style\" to whatever subject comes his way. Whether churning out comedies (Splash, Parenthood), kids' movies (Willow, How the Grinch Stole Christmas), dramas (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind) or period pieces (Far and Away, Cinderella Man), there are other directors who could have made them better. A bad film by Lars Von Trier (and you can't get much worse than Dancer in the Dark) is more interesting than a \"good\" film by Ron Howard. </p> <p>Paradoxically, although Howard's filmography is more eclectic than most, all his films are similar, not in any auteurist sense, but because they are merely what audiences expect of a genre film, competently made commercial stuff with no individual signature. Ron Howard, who, to many people, will forever remain the lanky ineffectual teenager Richie Cunningham in television's Happy Days, once said he became a director to avoid being typecast as an actor. Certainly, he has refused to be typecast as a director. </p> <p>Yet auteurism and thematic or aesthetic eclecticism are not necessarily mutually exclusive - Howard Hawks, Jean Renoir, Fritz Lang were eclectic, while Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and John Ford were less so. Also there were studio hacks such as Allan Dwan, WS Van Dyke, Tay Garnett, Victor Fleming, Henry Hathaway and Michael Curtiz who made excellent films because of the backing of the streamlined major studios, with their permanent crews of production designers, directors of photography, editors and costume designers. In fact, one could say that MGM, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros were the true auteurs of their films. </p> <p>Directors like Ron Howard, Ridley and Tony Scott, Adrian Lyne, Barry Sonnenfeld, Steven Soderbergh, Joel Schumacher, Rob Cohen and Stephen Sommers would probably have been better directors under the old studio system, and might even have been considered \"auteurs\". Since most directors today have far more autonomy than the directors of Hollywood's golden era, the \"auteur theory\" died when the studio system died in the late 50s. Thank goodness auteurism is still alive and well.</p>",

  "<p>Logica raised its revenue expectations yesterday after reporting better than expected half-year results. Chief executive Andy Green said the IT services firm had seen some slowdown in spending by financial services firms but income from other sectors was holding up well. </p> <p>\"There is uncertainty out there,\" he said. \"As we get into the fourth quarter of this year, many people will re-set their IT budgets for 2009, and we do not know what they will do. If they do decide to set them lower, then we will see some slowdown.\"</p> <p>Green also predicted that Europe, where the British firm earns 95% of its revenue, would hold up well despite yesterday's gloomy data on the eurozone economies. \"I still remain of the view that Europe as a whole will deliver low GDP growth - zero, 1% or 2%; that sort of level - and the IT services business will grow at a few percentage points above that. The big players like ourselves will do better than the smaller players.\"</p> <p>Green took over at Logica in January after the ousting of Martin Read. When Green announced a turnaround plan in April, he predicted revenue growth this year would be 3%, suggesting the market would slow as the year goes on. </p> <p>Yesterday, however, he increased that forecast to 4%, suggesting a stronger second half than expected, and helping shares to gain more than 10%. Over the first six months of 2008, Logica's revenue rose 6% to just under \u00a31.77bn, well ahead of the City's forecasts of \u00a31.67bn. Half-year operating profits up 16% at \u00a3118m were also slightly better than many expected.</p> <p>\"Interim results are a shade ahead of our estimates,\" said George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon, while the technology team at Piper Jaffray added: \"This is a solid statement from Logica, showing that the operational performance has remained strong despite the major changes as part of the strategic plan.\"</p> <p>Logica saw a much better performance from the core UK unit, which accounts for a fifth of Logica's revenue. Last year saw its profit margins plunge to 1.3% as a result of over-runs on big contracts. Over the first six months of this year the UK business reported margins of 6.3% as revenues grew 6% to \u00a3354m, and operating profits leapt to \u00a322m from \u00a34m last year.</p> <p>Green's plan to turn around the business includes cutting 1,300 jobs out of a workforce of 39,000, and beefing up its offshore facilities in countries such as Morocco and India to meet demand from customers seeking to reduce their costs.</p> <p>Over the past six months Logica has increased this offshore workforce from 3,450 to 3,900, and expects to have 8,000 by the end of next year.</p> <p>Green said that what its customers, who include many of the world's largest corporations, require is changing. </p> <p>Rather than starting big IT projects they want to use technology to reduce costs. \"We were talking a lot [to customers] about new customer relationship management (CRM) systems and business intelligence systems, and now they are asking, 'how are we going to do some of the work we do today in Morocco and India, to get costs under control?'.\"</p>",

  "<p>The planning application for the rebuilding of the Donington Park circuit in preparation for the 2010 British grand prix is due to be lodged with North West Leicestershire Council within the next few weeks, according to sources close to the race promoters yesterday.</p> <p>Ever since Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial rights holder, said he had signed a long-term contract to move Britain's round of the world championship from Silverstone, there has been scepticism over whether the upgrading of Donington could be completed in time.</p> <p>However, the circuit's owners are not anticipating any undue problems with the planning process as they believe it falls within the framework of the existing Donington motor sport legislation. The news will disappoint those British Racing Drivers' Club members who had predicted there was insufficient time for the work to be completed and that the race would remain at Silverstone beyond next year's expiry of the current contract. But BRDC president, Damon Hill, said: \"As far as we are concerned the British grand prix is moving to Donington in 2010. What we now have to do is knuckle down and work to ensure that Silverstone remains a centre of excellence for British motor sport.\"</p>",
  "<p>My dear, the drama of it all! A podium storm-off, a bronze medal cast in protest to a still sweat-flecked mat, and the suggestion that some Olympic judges may not be the paragons of competent impartiality one might hope. But that's Greco-Roman wrestling: one turns up expecting to watch various pairs of psychopaths play Twister, and it swiftly descends into accusations of institutionalised corruption and the first medal refusal of the Beijing Games.</p> <p>And so to the Chinese Agricultural University, venue for a sport you are dared to understand the rules of, where yesterday Sweden's 84kg-class wrestler Ara Abrahamian ripped his bronze from his neck the minute it had been hung there, and stalked out, leaving it lying in the centre circle. The medal is now in the hands of wrestling's governing body, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Luttes Associ\u00e9es, which is helping the IOC with its inquiries. Abrahamian has declared himself finished with the wrestling game.</p> <p>A silver medallist in Athens, the Swede had been set on gold, and believes he was denied by erroneous scoring in the semi-final against the Italian Andrea Minguzzi, who went on to take gold. Something to do with those controversial reverse clinch calls we've all been hearing so much about, perhaps, or some unauthorised mankini-tugging during the bit where one of them gets down on all fours like a dog and the other one has to try and flip him over like a beetle. Your correspondent couldn't be more on top of the rules, naturally, but the Swedish wrestling coach Leo Myllari was good enough to provide the following technical summary of the complaint: \"It's all politics. They're all corrupt.\"</p> <p>\"They\" being the judges, who had been borne down upon by Abrahamian after he fought back for bronze in the repechage. The Swede - who in compliance with unwritten Greco-Roman wrestling law looks Russian - marched toward them, shouting furiously, before swatting away an official urging restraint and punching a metal barrier. He and his coach are considering taking the whole business to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Minguzzi, a policeman, declined to open his own investigation, accusing Abrahamian of spoiling the medal ceremony. \"In sports,\" he declared tartly, \"it is appropriate to show sportsmanship and accept the results.\"</p> <p>Frankly, it felt wrong to attempt to defuse the tension by saying something along the lines of: \"So come on Andrea - do you want The Undertaker next? Could you just stare menacingly into a TV camera and yelp 'I want you, Undertaker, you can't hide from me!'\" </p> <p>And yet, given Abrahamian's obvious gift for theatrics, and that promised career change, perhaps it will be the Swede who will entice the call from WWE overlord Vince McMahon. And those calls do come. The path from Olympic wrestling to the gilded cages and nuanced storylines of the WWE has been trodden, which some might argue does few favours to a sport which can struggle to be taken seriously. Still, why not just celebrate the success stories like Kurt Angle, who won gold in the 100kg freestyle wrestling at Atlanta and went on to become a WWE superstar (WWF, as it was)? He even beat The Rock at No Mercy in 2000, and though The Rock would eventually return from that and take the championship at No Way Out in February of the next year, it should remind us all that there can be second acts in wrestling lives. </p> <p>One who resisted the call, though, was the two-time Olympic medallist Rulon Gardner, who has been commenting for NBC this week, and underscoring Greco-Roman's reputation as a sport so fiendishly esoteric even former champions get in a muddle about the rules. \"Even Rulon gets confused when he's commentating sometimes,\" explained Danny Macy, a wrestling fan who has travelled to Beijing from Oregon. \"They're always changing the rules to bring in new fans, but they're just driving people away.\"</p> <p>Whatever the rules are at the minute, the Beijing announcer rattled through them yesterday in the same high-speed mumble as the advert voiceover which warns that a medication can-cause-dizziness-numbness-palpitations-fevers-and-in-some-cases-death. Given much more airtime were the soft rock classics by Van Halen and Starship, interspersed with constant reminders that \"YOU are at the China Agricultural University!\" And here come the big-eared farm boys. That's nonsense, actually: not all the competitors worked their way up from the notoriously competitive cattle-wrestling leagues. Indeed, a 37-year-old Canadian with his own city law firm had wrestled earlier in the day. Unfortunately, Ari Taub lost in his first bout, and will be going home to Calgary, probably to listen to a lot of people think they're the first person to joke that these days, he's just wrestling with his case files. Overall, though - and despite several favourites going out perplexingly early - it was Russia's event, as they gained three golds and a silver, with the Cuban Mijain Lopez triumphing in the 120kg class.</p> <p>All of which would have wrapped up this Olympiad's Greco-Roman news, had it not been for Abrahamian's protest. Where it will all end now we cannot say. But a bronze medal has hit the mat, and we must officially class this story as developing.</p>",
  "<p>Danny Care is the only one of the Auckland four, the quartet of England internationals who found themselves caught up in rape allegations during the tour to New Zealand last June before being cleared in a subsequent inquiry, who is still in the senior squad. The 21-year old scrum-half describes the events that month, when media speculation abounded but the players were advised by lawyers to remain silent, as a \"life experience\" and believes he will emerge the stronger for it.</p> <p>Care was the only one of the four to escape without censure from Jeff Blackett, the Rugby Football Union's chief disciplinary officer who conducted the inquiry into the claims made by an 18-year-old waitress after the first Test against the All Blacks in Auckland. Mike Brown and Topsy Ojo were fined after admitting staying up most of the night, while David Strettle received a warning after becoming the victim of a kiss-and-tell story sold to a red-top newspaper.</p> <p>\"I knew I would be cleared because I had done nothing wrong, but it was a difficult time,\" said Care. \"There were various stories in newspapers and we were unable to say anything in response. Family and friends were clearly concerned, but there came a time when I had to turn my phone off for a couple of days so I could focus on the second Test. It is now time to draw a line under that matter and concentrate on the rugby but it has made me stronger.\"</p> <p>The 32-strong squad, which gathered in London on Monday for its first training camp under the new team manager, Martin Johnson, has had two meetings about discipline. \"They were led by the players, even if it is something that has to be driven by the coaches,\" said Johnson. \"What the squad went through in New Zealand cannot happen again. The players are aware of that and we have talked about responsibility.</p> <p>\"What happened doesn't reflect the calibre of the people in the squad, but it's done now and we have to deal with it. We've had a couple of really good meetings. That's part of the process of being a team and everyone is keen to make amends. Four days and two meetings will not put everything right: it is an everyday process. It's all about being successful and we don't want the headlines we've had this year on a couple of occasions. That makes it difficult for us to operate. We're not doing this to appease the media, we're doing it because we think it's the right way to be a successful team.\"</p> <p>Care said that Johnson had already made a difference as England looked to put the June jolts behind them. \"While it was a difficult tour, it was also a source of pride because I won my first two England caps,\" he said. \"I started last season third in line at Harlequins and getting injured on the opening weekend, so to finish it by playing against one of the best teams in the world was memorable, even if the results were not. I was pleased with parts of my game, but I clearly have lots to work on and I have been doing that with the coaches in training this week. Martin Johnson commands unqualified respect and it is clear that we are under a new regime.\"</p> <p>Care will face the challenge of Harry Ellis, who missed most of last season after a knee operation, in the coming months, and scrum-half will become an even more influential position as sides tackle the experimental law variations which came into force in Europe this month.</p> <p>\"I think games will become more open and there should be more opportunities for scrum-halves to make breaks,\" said Care. \"I have done a lot of work with Brian Smith [the England backs coach] on my running, kicking and passing. I am going to find myself in the outside-half channel a lot more often and I expect a lot more counter-attacking rugby from teams.</p> <p>\"I am aware that it is going to be tough to hold on to the England jersey and I need to play well for Harlequins. I want to play for my country as many times as I can and be part of a successful team. We learned a lot in New Zealand, on and off the field, and there were positives to take from the trip. We are all looking forward now and this is going to be a massive year for me ... I can't wait.\"</p> <h2>Smith calls for clarity</h2> <p>The backs coach Brian Smith yesterday promised a new-look England next season, but he refused to reveal the form the tactical overhaul would take. \"I am not going to give much away ahead of the November internationals, but we will reflect the talent we have in the squad,\" said the former Australia and Ireland outside-half who was appointed last month. \"A problem teams can have in unsuccessful times is churn and burn, when they react to defeats by changing the cattle. We have picked 32 players and we are right behind them. It is important that they all have clarity about the way we want to play. We have a mix of world-class players and others who are not the finished article. What is essential is that we go into games with Plan A and B so that players have something to fall back on if things go wrong. They will have freedom, but we will provide the framework and the new laws will open up attacking opportunities from scrums.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gareth Southgate is hoping to persuade Justin Hoyte to become a Middlesbrough player today after the club agreed a fee, thought to be around \u00a33m, with Arsenal for the right-back yesterday. The 23-year-old former England Under-21 international, who has struggled to establish himself in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's first XI, was driving to Teesside to meet Southgate and undergo a medical last night.</p> <p>\"I've got to convince the player this is the place for him to come and play his football,\" admitted Boro's manager. \"Justin Hoyte has got fantastic potential. He's already a very good player and we've done research, we know he's a good professional in terms of his lifestyle.\"</p> <p>Hoyte spent the 2005-06 season on loan at Sunderland and Southgate said: \"I've spoken to his agent and he's said coming up to the North-east is not an issue.\" If he decides on the move, Hoyte will replace Luke Young, who was sold to Aston Villa. </p> <p><strong>Fulham</strong>'s \u00a310.5m summer signing Andrew Johnson has been ruled out of the Premier League season opener at Hull City. The England international has yet to recover from a thigh strain he picked up while still at Everton. The Fulham manager Roy Hodgson also revealed the complex negotiations to take the former Crystal Palace front-man to Craven Cottage had prevented the problem from being treated in time. </p> <p>\"Andy Johnson will not be able to feature because he had a thigh strain when he came to the club and we don't want to take the risk with that,\" he said, \"although I'm pretty sure he will be able to play against Arsenal the following week. </p> <p>\"When we started our negotiations he had taken part in a shooting practice at Everton just before they left for America and got a strain in his left thigh. We started to treat him as soon as we could, which was four or five days after the incident, but that unfortunately has cost us a week.\" </p> <p>Hodgson also made it clear he would not be allowing left-back Paul Konchesky to leave the club. The former West Ham and Charlton player is reportedly a \u00a32m target for Blackburn should Stephen Warnock leave the North-west club.</p>",
  "<p>\"I tell lies. Not, like, proper lies, just little lies. I started telling 'em - jokes, I should call them - when I was very young. I've always had a sense of humour, but people haven't always shared it.\" Solange Knowles opens her almond-shaped eyes wide. \"The problem,\" she continues, \"is that my tone is very dry, so people never know when I don't mean things. When I was younger, I used to have more of a chirpy delivery, but I don't have the energy for that shit no more.\"</p> <p>Energy does not at first seem to be a quality she possesses in abundance - she slouches into the room, half an hour late, wearing just a pink negligee, and for the most part acts as if she has just been dragged from her bed. That is a red herring. Later in the day, showcasing her new album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St Dreams at the Notting Hill Arts Club, Solange performs with demented glee: nailing her frenetic choreography, climbing on the speaker stacks, bobbing and weaving among the audience.</p> <p>Her restless, inquisitive character is confirmed by her music. Sol-Angel is an eccentric mix of 60s Motown throwbacks and cut-and-pasted electronica (\"I wanted it to be like a journey through time,\" she says). On her equally offbeat MySpace blog, Solange says: \"I want to be like the black Bj\u00f6rk!\" and declares that her new year's resolution is to \"use my middle finger a lot more. I always think, what person did that gesture and made it so famous for saying, 'Fuck you!' Why wasn't it a pinky or a thumb?\" In person, her conversation is elliptical and punctuated with long pauses even when she warms up. \"People think I'm high, even when I'm sober,\" she says. \"You probably think I'm high right now.\"</p> <p>That kind of public communique is, perhaps, surprising given Solange's background: she is the little sister of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. Given Beyonc\u00e9's public commitment to moral rectitude, one wouldn't expect her sister to be a divorced mother of one who sings about sex and weed (ChampagneChronicNightcap) and who has tattoos on her wrists (\"They mean that when one life goes, one life comes. One of my friends passed away - and the next thing I knew, I was pregnant. So I was just having lots of thoughts about reincarnation\"). Not that she's willing to talk about her relationship with her sister, and how it might have affected her music. \"I don't find that interesting. At all,\" she says.</p> <p>What is she interested in? Visual art, the history of prostitution in Chicago, and architecture. \"I'm always thinking, if I make a lot of money one day, it'd be ideal to have one of the sketches in my brain built. By the way, I just wanna say: that building in Dubai? The one where every floor rotates? I had a nightmare about it, that everyone ... yeah, I can't share that. Dubai's a pretty powerful place. They might not let me in. But it was definitely not a good dream.\" Does she want to go there? \"Only if I can have sex on the beach. Hang on! That was a joke. Include that. Put L-O-L. Anyway, I really love lofts.There are a lot of historical lofts in Houston and it's amazing for me that a lot of them were built in the 1920s. I love the exposed bricks and the very industrial stuff. They're not so much like the buildings in Dubai.\"</p> <p>Solange's conversational obliqueness also seems like a defence mechanism. Probing too deeply leads to vagueness or flippancy: questions about her time in Idaho, where she lived with her ex-husband for two years, are batted away with the response, \"I loved potatoes. And then I left them behind, because I left the potato man.\" Later, she snaps, \"I think people focus too much energy on getting people to like them, trying to get people to accept them. I've never felt any validation from that.\"</p> <p>Describing what she was like as a child, though, Solange finally provides a clue to her character: \"I was ridiculous and crazy and sporadic. I was just in my own little world. I still am.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the legend goes, if you plant your pocket change on the silty banks of the lower Mississippi River, copper and silver trees will spring up overnight. Maybe that's not entirely true - but what Memphis, Tennessee lacks in monetary riches has, in musical wealth, been harvested a hundredfold. Beginning in the early 20th century and lasting until the mid-1970s, Memphis was the birthing ground for pop music in the truest sense of the word. Popular music - purveyed, initially, by groups such as the Memphis Jug Band and the Mississippi Sheiks (who were the U2 and Radiohead of their day) - then transmogrified into guttural, guitar-based blues; raucous, early rock'n'roll; and sweet southern soul. The hits flowed, initially midwifed by a trio of unlikely doulas: the intense, godlike Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, Hi Records/Royal Studio's cerebrally cool Poppa Willie Mitchell, and Stax head Jim Stewart, a bank teller-turned-soul music maven. They set the standard, and then dozens more would-be producers scrambled to catch up, turning garages, hotel rooms and even YMCA hallways into makeshift studios. </p> <p>Howlin' Wolf, BB King, Ike Turner, Bobby \"Blue\" Bland and Finas Newborn's family band. Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Charlie Feathers, Charlie Rich. OV Wright and Al Green; Elvis Presley and Otis Redding. Even their names serve as onomatopoeic clues to the sonic mysteries that lay dormant for years, then sprang into America's consciousness overnight. </p> <p>Some were born within the city limits; others migrated here from outlying specks on the map to be reborn. Some stopped here for a short layover, on their way to bigger and better things; others put down Memphis roots and remained, no matter how rich or successful they became. Isaac Hayes was one of those who came from the country. </p> <p>Born - literally, in a tin-roofed shack - to a family of sharecroppers in rural Rialto, Tennessee, in 1942, Hayes was orphaned at an early age and handed over to his grandmother, Rushia Wade. Like many African-Americans of that era, Hayes toiled in the cotton fields and found solace at church. He moved, with his grandparents and sister, Willette Hayes, to Memphis in June 1949. They found a home on the north side of town, but by the time Hayes graduated from high school, he'd already found his way across town to an inner-city neighborhood that lay between Sun Studio and Graceland. </p> <p>If Memphis is the birthplace of blues and rock'n'roll music, Hayes's district - Soulsville, USA, as it was eventually called - is recognised as ground zero. Aretha Franklin took her first breath here, on Lucy Street; blues pianist Memphis Slim and R&amp;B singer Johnny Ace hung their hats in houses just a few blocks away in either direction. Two gospel powerhouses, the diminutive Lucie Campbell and her larger-than-life counterpart, Rev Herbert Brewster, saved souls, while Slim Jenkins' Place and the Four-Way Grill addressed citizens' more earthly needs. In the 1950s, an abandoned Soulsville cinema, the Royal, was resurrected as Hi Records' recording studio. A decade later, Jim Stewart and his sister Estelle Axton transformed the Capitol Theatre, located at 926 E McLemore Avenue, into a studio called Stax. </p> <p>Long before Hayes walked through the doors at Stax, a plethora of neighborhood kids - including would-be songwriter David Porter, who bagged groceries across the street, and organist Booker T Jones - had already made it across the threshold, hanging out in the tiny Satellite Record Shop and availing themselves whenever opportunity struck. Hayes, dubbed \"the Smooth Crooner\" by his classmates, tried to gain entry twice and failed, first with a doo-wop group, the Ambassadors, and then with a blues band called Calvin and the Swing Cats. He slipped past Stewart's watchful eye in 1964, as a pianist on an instrumental single called Frog Stomp. </p> <p>Before then, life was tough. Like so many African-American matriarchs eking out a meager existence in the Jim Crow south, Rushia Wade often fell short. She and her grandchildren bounced from a one-room flat above a storefront church to less habitable places where they had to break down the wooden outhouse and burn it for kindling, or trundle buckets of water from the neighbours' apartments in order to cook and wash up. Unconsciously emulating Clarksdale, Mississippi-born Ike Turner and Rosemark, Tennessee native Bobby \"Blue\" Bland, Hayes responded the only way he knew how: mastering the street corner hustle. Turner's method was raising chickens and masquerading as a beggar; Bland preferred parking white folks' cars and transporting moonshine across the county line. Hayes adapted to city life by delivering groceries, shining shoes and passing out fliers for shows at the Savoy Theatre. </p> <p>He'd dropped out of high school once, but, encouraged by his grandmother, stuck it out, attaining his degree when he was 20 years old and married. With a baby on the way, Hayes got a job at a meat packing plant, and in his spare time started hanging out at the American Sound Studios, run by the great white, blue-eyed soul songwriter and producer Chips Moman. By 1961 he was singing three nights a week at Curry's Club Tropicana; Hayes picked up piano by bluffing his way into a gig at the Plantation Inn; and, when Booker T Jones went off to college, he began sitting in on various Stax sessions. From there he became a songwriter, writing hit after hit for Stax with his partner David Porter, then became a recording star in his own right. Hayes was one of the dominating figures in the second decade of Memphis's reign as, arguably, the most important city in the history of popular music.</p> <p>The number of hit singles that flew out of Memphis recording studios and on to the Billboard charts from 1954-1974 is still mind-boggling. Starting with That's All Right Mama, Elvis's Sun debut, Memphis hit its stride with a string of Moman-engineered hits - 122 songs, to be exact, including Sandy Posey's Born a Woman, Dusty Springfield's Son of a Preacher Man, Neil Diamond's Sweet Caroline and Elvis's Suspicious Minds - then wound down with Al Green and Ann Peebles' no-less-astonishing Hi oeuvre. Recounting a list is easy. It's much more difficult to decipher the why.</p> <p>Ask anyone with any amount of interest in Memphis music, and they'll point to the humidity, the aftereffects of segregation, and that fertile Mississippi mud. The truth is, no one quite understands just what happened here time and time again. </p> <p>Race relations were certainly a factor. Like many great art movements, much of Memphis's musical legacy was borne on an unsettling malaise, which hung over the city like a fog. Sun studio, in which Phillips harnessed what he described as \"a raw, black sound\", lay just a stone's throw from the gravesite of the confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest, founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Brought to town to galvanise striking sanitation workers, Martin Luther King Jr was shot down on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, where many Stax staffers, black and white, gathered to eat barbecue, swim and work on songs. Talented African-Americans who tried their luck in the music biz toed a delicate line, as crooner Billy Eckstine discovered when he sat down for a meal at a Memphis restaurant and was served a steak dinner topped with finely ground glass. When that racial tension collided with creative genius, the results were nearly always incendiary. </p> <p>Religion - amplified by the sharp contrast between the devil-may-care attitudes that prevailed on Saturday night and the humble worshippers who prayed for eternal salvation on Sunday mornings - was another factor. Some musicians, such as Jerry Lee Lewis, struggled to make that tough decision between the club scene and the church. Others, including Elvis, who in his early years often snuck out the back door of the all-white Assembly of God Church to take in services at Rev Brewster's East Trigg Baptist Church, capitalised on the dynamics of religious fanaticism and hedonistic fervour. </p> <p>Poverty, perhaps, was the most motivating factor of all. It gnawed at empty stomachs, and spurred countless dreamers into action. Even Elvis started out as poor folk. His father, a one-time cheque forger, did time on Parchman Farm; upon his release in 1948, the Presleys loaded everything they owned into their 1937 Plymouth and moved from Tupelo, Mississippi, to Memphis's Lauderdale Courts housing project in a desperate bid to start life fresh. Elvis's dogged determination put the family on an upward trajectory that rocketed them, in less than a decade, from public housing to the Graceland mansion. </p> <p>At Stax, Hayes embraced and exploited all of it. Teamed with fellow songwriter Porter, he mined his gospel background for potential hits for performers such as the Soul Children and Sam and Dave. As a solo star in the 1970s, he transformed himself into Black Moses, an avatar for the black consciousness movement. And, thanks to (Theme From) Shaft, he was landing $300,000 a year, running his own recording studio, called Hot Buttered Soul, and living part-time in Beverly Hills. The confident, sharply dressed bald-headed figure who strode down McLemore Avenue bore little resemblance to the resolute young man in patched, outgrown clothes who once loitered outside under the Stax marquee. With the purchase of a 1972 Cadillac El Dorado custom-trimmed in white fur and solid gold, the metamorphosis from cotton picker to megastar was complete. </p> <p>But his good thing was about to end. Here in west Tennessee, it's perceived as a matter of fact: the success of many Memphis musicians is often eclipsed by a spectacular downfall. Bo Carter, who as the frontman for the Mississippi Sheiks was once one of the south's biggest recording stars, died blind and destitute in Memphis in September 1964. Johnny Cash, who never quite recovered from the guilt he felt after the death of his brother Jack, wrestled with drug addiction for years. OV Wright, another drug casualty, died of a heart attack at 41 and was given a pauper's burial in an unmarked grave. Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays were killed when their plane crashed into icy Lake Monona in December 1967. Presley died, allegedly, on the toilet in August 1977. Al Green barely survived an attack from a spurned lover, who tossed a pot of boiling grits on his bare skin. And Ike Turner survived a prison stint and accusations of wife-beating, only to die of a cocaine overdose last year. </p> <p>In retrospect, Hayes got off lightly. He was forced into bankruptcy brought on by Stax Records' own financial problems, which cost him royalties from everything he'd written, produced or recorded at Stax. He endured a humiliating public auction, where greedy Memphians pawed over his lavish wardrobe, his jewellery and other personal effects. He was able to return, but never as the star he had been.</p> <p>The Memphis music industry has fared less well. When the once-mighty Stax and American Sound Studios closed their doors in the mid-1970s, a creative diaspora took place, flinging singers and session players far and wide. Those who could packed their bags and moved out of town, following the paths of relatives who fled the south in the great migration of the 1940s. The number of hits recorded here in the past three decades are faint blips on the Billboard charts. There are a handful of rap songs, including Three 6 Mafia's telling It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp, a heavy metal number by a band called Saliva, and Cat Power's charming indie effort, The Greatest, which features one-time Stax and Hi guitarist Teenie Hodges' work. The city's greatest export, Justin Timberlake, is a marquee name, but for the most part, JT prefers the creature comforts of Hollywood to the local scene. </p> <p>Hayes's unexpected death last Sunday - it occurred a few days before the 31st anniversary of Elvis's passing, a hoopla locals call \"Death Week\" - caps off a rough couple of weeks. A local disc jockey, Steve Ladd, was felled by a brain aneurysm on July 20. Five days earlier, 73-year-old Dee Henderson - known to listeners of WEVL, a community radio station, as longtime volunteer blues DJ \"Cap'n Pete\" - was murdered. Henderson, like Hayes, was the son of sharecroppers who came to Memphis in search of a better life. To the horror of friends and family, his grandson, Cortez Thomas, confessed within hours to shooting Henderson in the back as he tended to his garden. Then last Saturday, Chicago-born comedian Bernie Mac unexpectedly died, four months after spending time here filming the movie Soul Men - which features Hayes in a cameo role. Soul Men, due for release in November, was originally intended as a Sam and Dave tribute. Now it will memorialise Mac and Hayes' last work.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty-year-old viola player Lawrence Power is surrounded by the paraphernalia of the international soloist: the Nokia smartphone, the bags of music, and an austere, unadorned instrument case. You wouldn't think to look at this anonymous exterior that it houses Power's holy of holies, the 400-year-old viola by Antonio Brensi that he has been playing for the past six years. \"It's such a fabulous instrument,\" he says. \"It asks questions of me and inspires me. When I first started playing it, it was like driving a Porsche when you've just passed your driving test. It took me four or five years before I came to terms with it. It manages to combine both the deep viola sound, and the sweeter, higher side. But it's temperamental: you have to know how to treat it. It's harder to play than a modern instrument, and sometimes you think, 'Oh for fuck's sake, I just want to play in tune.' But my viola has an endless bank of colour you can access, and there's so much personality in each note. It's very inspiring.\"</p> <p>Power's softly-spoken self-effacement belies his achievements, and his vertiginous rise to the top of the viola-playing world. He's now a sought-after soloist from Switzerland to Tanglewood and, for the past decade, has been one of the Nash Ensemble's principal instrumentalists. Growing up in Buckinghamshire, Power says he began playing when he was seven, \"and I did start on the viola\" - many viola players begin on the violin, the viola's smaller and more glamorous sibling in the string family. But for Power, the viola was never a second choice, or something he was forced to play as a boy because the school orchestra needed some viola fillers - a common experience, and one reason the instrument is the butt of so many orchestral in-jokes. \"I just love the viola,\" he says. \"I find its sound very touching, because it's very close to the sound and the range of the human speaking voice. It can sing, or be dramatic, and it has a lot of emotion in it when it's played well.\"</p> <p>Power gave up studying at the age of 20, after stints at the Guildhall in London and the Juilliard in New York, and immediately embarked on his career, a mix of chamber music and concerto work. Surely these are two completely different roles, the subtle give-and-take of playing Brahms with the Nash Ensemble, as opposed to fronting an orchestra in, say, Walton's Viola Concerto or Berlioz's Harold in Italy? \"No, the two really do feed each other,\" he says. \"The majority of my solo repertoire is 20th-century, whether it's York Bowen or Bart\u00f3k. And musically, I wouldn't feel complete if I wasn't able to work on Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert or Haydn with the Nash. It really nourishes me as a musician.\" </p> <p>Unlike the solo violinist with scores of concertos to choose from stretching all the way back to Bach, the solo viola repertoire is more limited. \"I'm sick and tired of hearing how many great composers were viola players - Schubert, Dvor\u00e1k, Mozart - because none of them left any solo music for the viola. OK, so maybe I can excuse Mozart because of the Sinfonia Concertante [for solo violin and solo viola], but if only there was a solo Mozart concerto!\" </p> <p>In the 20th century, there was a sudden bloom of viola concertos, thanks to the efforts of two British violists: Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. \"It took these two great individuals to establish the viola as a solo instrument,\" Power says, \"and it's wonderful as a British player to have that tradition behind you. I'm really enjoying discovering and performing the repertoire they created - music by Arnold Bax, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Walton, Vaughan Williams.\" (He'll be playing Vaughan Williams's Flos Campi, originally composed for Tertis, at the Proms on Sunday.) </p> <p>So is the viola inherently British? Tongue only half-in-cheek, Power says: \"Maybe it's that slight sense of reserve, inwardness, and saying sorry all the time. Maybe that suits the sound of the viola.\"</p> <p>Outwardly, Power's personality fits the mould of modesty and humility that are prerequisites for the role of the British viola player. Yet his performances are so impressive because of his passion, fire and sheer intensity on the platform. He can make contemporary chamber music - which Power playfully calls \"hard-core squeak\" - by the likes of Elliott Carter and Simon Holt sound as if it were long-standing parts of the repertoire. </p> <p>Five years ago, he was headhunted by the Berlin Philharmonic to lead their viola section. \"It came completely out of the blue,\" he says. \"Apart from at college, I'd never played in an orchestra before. Somebody came to check me out at a concert in Berlin - it was all very cloak and dagger - and asked if I wanted to come over. I went in gung-ho and didn't know what to expect, and ended up absolutely loving it. I was struck by the fact that you don't really need experience to play in an orchestra like that: they're like a big chamber group, and they listen to each other so intensely. I think they liked the fact that I wasn't a nervous wreck - as you probably would be if you really wanted the position. I mean, in one respect, it's the greatest job in the world ... It was a big decision not to go down that road.\"</p> <p>Power is coy about the details, but it seems clear he was offered the job and turned it down. Why? \"My mum, who's not a musician, came to one of the concerts, at the Barbican in London. I was very emotional, you know, leading these musicians, and afterwards - it was Mahler's Third Symphony, conducted by Bernard Haitink - she gave me this sort of blank look, and said, 'Well, we couldn't hear you!' That sort of summed it up: even in that orchestra, ultimately, you're just one of many.\" </p> <p>It might seem a strange decision to give up the Berlin Phil for York Bowen, but Power returned to London, to continue as a Nash Ensemble regular, and international chamber musician and soloist. \"It's something you really have to cherish, when you can really show your personality as a string player.\" </p> <p>And he's especially passionate about Bowen's music: for the Hyperion label, he's recently recorded all of the chamber music with viola, and his lyrical, heartfelt Viola Concerto, another piece written for Tertis, in 1907. \"In his day, Bowen was a megastar,\" Power says. \"It's music that I play all over the world now, and it always goes down well: the sign of a good piece, I think.\" Power is also commissioning concertos of his own: there's music by Gerald Barry and James MacMillan in the pipeline, to add to the premieres he has already given of Mark-Anthony Turnage and Sally Beamish. Tertis and Primrose would be proud: Power is a worthy successor to their legacy, a contemporary catalyst for the viola and all of its repertoires.<br></p>",

  "<p>Bellway, Britain's fourth-largest housebuilder, added yesterday to the gloom that has enveloped the sector with a warning that sales volumes, prices and margins were all falling.</p> <p>The company said that in the year to the end of July it had sold 6,556 homes - more than 14% below the previous 12 months, while the average selling price had slipped from \u00a3173,000 to \u00a3169,000.</p> <p>In the past few days the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said sales had slumped, and Halifax figures showed a 10%-plus fall in prices. Bellway said that, given the current state of the market, it believed it had turned in a satisfactory performance.</p> <p>Shares in the sector have fallen this week on the gloomy outlook and concerns that rising inflation will curb the Bank of England's monetary policy committee's scope to cut interest rates. Yesterday Bellway fell 15.5p to 560p. Other housebuilders also saw their shares marked down.</p> <p>Cazenove analysts noted: \"We continue to believe the relief rally following Barratt's refinancing deal has been overdone and that we will see share price weakness in the lead up to the reporting season.\"</p> <p>In yesterday's trading statement, Bellway said operating margins could fall by up to 3% from last year's 18.7%. The company had been offering incentives to customers who found their mortgage lender had cut the value they were prepared to place on properties.</p> <p>John Watson, chief executive, said: \"We have thrown more money at that.

  "<p>France's reputation as one of the world's prime holiday destinations took a hit yesterday as reports revealed the soaring cost of its hotels and dubious hygiene standards in its tourist-friendly restaurants. </p> <p>The average price of a French hotel room has risen by 41% since 2001 - more than double the rate of inflation, according to figures released by the national institute for statistics, L'Ins\u00e9e. Customers looking to spend the night in a three-star hotel are now likely to have to pay \u20ac137 (\u00a3109), compared with just \u20ac96 eight years ago. </p> <p>This year costs have risen even more steeply, with average hotel room prices going up by 7.4% in the first six months of 2008 - more than three times the rate of inflation. \"The soaring price of petrol has made hotel owners' gas and electricity bills even bigger,\" said Geraldine Seroussi, head of statistics at L'Ins\u00e9e. Also to blame, she added, were rising food prices and several hikes in the minimum wage. </p> <p>According to the Committee for the Modernisation of French Hotels (CMHF), the higher cost does not reflect higher standards. \"Many customers grow tired or disillusioned when confronted by the rise in prices, which hasn't necessarily been accompanied by an improvement in the quality of service,\" said Mark Watkins, president of the CMHF, which classes a quarter of the country's 18,000 hotels as rundown. </p> <p>The standards of another key area of French tourism were also called into question yesterday by figures showing more than one in four seaside restaurants, cafes and snack bars were found to have poor hygiene conditions. </p> <p>Of the 9,403 establishments inspected this summer, more than 2,600 were found to be in breach of hygiene law, said the minister for agriculture, Michel Barnier. The 37 worst offenders had been ordered to close, he added, while hundreds more had had their kitchens raided after they were found to be serving food unfit for consumption. The amount of food stocks seized came to about 30 tonnes of waste - up from 13 tonnes last summer. </p> <p>Monique Eloit, spokeswoman for the agriculture ministry's food directorate, said the eateries that had fallen foul of the law were those where basic cleaning had not been done, staff clothing was dirty, or the food had been badly stored.</p>",
  "<p>A sudden punch in the stomach of everyday existence can lurk around the most familiar corner, changing your life for ever. Two and a half years ago, I was an ordinary 27-year-old, who had just spent a night out playing records and dancing with my friends. Sharing a cab home, I was dropped off at the corner of the road, which is pedestrianised. I declined the offer to be accompanied on the one-minute walk to my front gate, and waved my friends off.</p> <p>With my door key in hand, I suddenly realised that a man had followed me up my front path. I also realised that the double lock was on, and my three flatmates were still out. As I opened the door, this man forced me into the house and put a knife to my throat. I was too terrified to scream. A Londoner for most of my life, I had always been cautious, confident and streetwise, and even at this stage part of me hoped he just wanted to mug me. </p> <p>That hope died quickly. As he pinned my struggling arms to the staircase, burning my elbows on our old red carpet, I knew I would never be the same again. He unbuttoned his fly with one hand, twisting my arm behind my back with the other. I tried to get away, but my attempt was met with a couple of punches and the cold, hard touch of the blade against my neck. \"Do that again and I'll kill you.\"</p> <p>Time paused; I found myself suspended between something dreadful that was about to happen and the second when it actually would. I remember repeating to myself, \"It hasn't happened yet\", and trying to appreciate that - my psyche was the only part of myself that I still had some control over. How far was this man prepared to go? How much was this going to hurt? Would one of my housemates come home and startle him into doing something even worse than he had in mind? Would this man actually carry out his threat to my life? I kept repeating to him the lie that I was pregnant, hoping that I could appeal to some sense of humanity; if he didn't care about raping a woman, then perhaps he might have some qualms about harming a developing baby. It may have worked - I don't know. It's possible that he attacked me less violently than he had planned to.</p> <p>Once it was over, he went through my bag and made off into the night with my mobile phone. I shut the door, hands shaking, and walked into the kitchen before bursting into tears. Picking up the house phone, I dialled 999. I remember noticing my record-filled bag, abandoned by the staircase. I must have clutched it until the very last minute. A bizarre thought occurred to me: thank God he didn't share my love for 60s and 70s country-folk and had left those albums untouched. Then, sitting in the kitchen, in stunned silence, I waited for the police.</p> <p>The rest of the night is a blur of scenes played out on autopilot. The police came within minutes and the house became a crime scene, with police tape around the front gate for all the passersby to wonder at. We had to go immediately - if I wanted to report the attack, they had to get a statement from me as well as whatever DNA evidence they could recover. I stared down at my ripped tights, my knee-length boots still miraculously zipped all the way up. I guessed they'd be needing my clothes, so I asked to be let upstairs to my bedroom to grab a pair of jeans. Then we left. </p> <p>At this point, the situation improved. This is when I met Suzie, the officer from the Metropolitan police's Sapphire unit (the designated sexual assault unit) and one of the people for whom you are grateful beyond words. Professional, compassionate and only a year older than me, she was honest and totally unpatronising as she took my initial statement in a small room at the local police station. This was to be the first of many meetings and updates. My statement was taken in my own time, breaks offered when I needed them and reassurance given when I hadn't even known to ask for it. I was reasonably calm while talking through the evening's events, trying to make sense of them, recollecting the minutiae probably far more than was expected. As someone who works in the media, immersing myself in other people's stories each day, it was weird to be asked to talk through my own. Would those investigating the case think I did something wrong? Would they think it was my fault because I'd had a few drinks? Would they think me foolish for not being walked to my front door? I wasn't breaking down in tears with every sentence - would they think I was unmoved or making things up? I shouldn't have worried. I was assured that no one can be blamed for being raped. It is a criminal attack. And there is certainly no set way to react to trauma; it was the job of the police to establish what had happened to me and find the attacker, not to judge how I coped. </p> <p>As soon as my statement was complete, Suzie drove me to the Haven in Whitechapel (one of three designated sexual assault referral centres in London) for forensic tests and examinations. The Haven aims to provide both holistic care for a victim of rape or sexual assault and to collect the best available evidence. </p> <p>First I had to get the forensic part over with. A doctor and nurse - both female - welcomed me into a small examination room and asked me to undress in an adjacent cubicle. I wasn't allowed to go to the toilet or even have a glass of water, but was handed a small towel. They dabbed, pricked and swabbed me for DNA evidence and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) - I was told they would test me for everything including hepatitis and HIV - and checked my bruises, drawing them on to a person-shaped diagram that would later form part of the evidence if the attacker was ever taken to court.</p> <p>I was checked from head to toe, new bruises announcing themselves on my body throughout. But I was so happy to be among people I trusted in this warm, safe, white room that I would have cartwheeled if they had asked me to. After they had got what they needed, even cutting some of my hair out, I was given a small washbag and allowed to shower. I was also given a new white sweatshirt and black gym plimsolls to wear with my jeans as they would be sending my clothes away for further analysis. Once inside the shower I let the warm water run and run, enjoying the peace and safety and quiet. I knew that after leaving the shower I'd have to face the full reality of what had happened, so I put it off for a few more solitary minutes. </p> <p>Once dressed, I was handed a pile of follow-up information (counselling options and repeat appointments for STD results and further tests), and was reassured that the tests would not appear on my GP's medical records or be disclosed to anyone outside the investigation. They told me I could also keep the sweater and plimsolls. Looking down at those items - which made me look like an eight-year-old in a PE class - I think I managed a smile. </p> <p>Suzie then drove me in an unmarked police car to the spot where my housemate and best friend were waiting, a few streets from our house. The police had left and we tried to walk down the road nonchalantly, so that people would not necessarily think that we were involved in the night's events.</p> <p>The next few weeks were taken up with more meetings, recorded statements, tests and results. Appointments were made according to my availability, and the uppermost levels of discretion were always adhered to. </p> <p>I waited a day to break it to my parents, initially telling them I'd been mugged and that was why I had no mobile phone. I didn't have the energy to deal with their grief, anger and worry. But I knew I'd have to tell them soon, as I was advised that I should leave my flat. (Although the attacker was believed to have been an opportunist, he was likely to have been a local man, and so I was still potentially in danger.) Until I found a new place to live, moving back to my parents' home seemed the most obvious, if not an entirely perfect, option. </p> <p>I kept working, as I had neither the money nor the headspace to take time off and dwell on what had happened. I just wanted control of my life back. I also didn't want people to suspect anything more than that I had been violently mugged. This was to be the start of my somewhat double life. I told a few friends, including those who had been in the cab with me, but no one apart from that. It was not just because I didn't want to be seen as a \"victim\" but also because I know that some people, perhaps unwittingly, revel in this kind of drama. I didn't want this event to define me for good or bad in anyone's eyes; I didn't want to be their sob story or hero, nor the subject of their gossip, however well-meaning. </p> <p>I also began to notice just how much rape and sexual assault is a theme of our television dramas, our cinema releases. I noticed how much the word rape crops up innocently in the English language; we have yellow fields of rape and whenever I write the word therapist I realise I am writing \"the rapist\". I hear how colloquial the term rape has become; \"Ugh, I feel like I've been raped,\" cringed a colleague of mine when a not-so-attractive boss invaded her personal space. I read in the newspapers time and again how low the conviction rate for rape is (the current figure is below 5%) and how unsympathetically the police allegedly treat women who report it. I noticed all of this, and I kept uncomfortably silent. </p> <p>By now the investigation had gone quiet as well. Even though my attacker's e-fit made the papers and the local news, his DNA didn't match any on the database. Unless he was picked up for another offence it was going to be very difficult to find him. I recorded a voiceover for a reconstruction on the BBC's Crimewatch programme, but after it aired the leads didn't really go anywhere. And all the while my life went on, as normally as possible. I got the all-clear from my HIV test while working away in Liverpool (snatching time in a car park to return the call from the Haven), I got together with my unbelievably wonderful boyfriend, found myself a flat that I loved and realised I was enjoying my life again. All this, admittedly, with a personal alarm firmly in my handbag and an avoidance of walking alone after dark. I even got used to the idea that my attacker was still at large. </p> <p>I kept in touch regularly with the Sapphire Unit. Suzie and I were, and are, in regular contact, and we would often meet up for a coffee where I could ask questions or air concerns. She was someone I could really talk to, who I could even, to my relief, have a laugh with. Then, almost exactly a year after the attack - on Friday 13, of all days - I got the call. They had arrested a man on another, unrelated charge, and his DNA was a match. I remember sitting in the local park near my work, the sun shining, the grass warm. I didn't know what to feel. But I did know that this man was now going to be prevented from doing to someone else what he had done to me. </p> <p>The situation was not as simple as I hoped. In the ensuing months he conjured up all sorts of excuses and alibis, wasting a year of police time and delaying the trial date as his story kept changing. Fortunately, he was refused bail. As frustrating as all this was, as the trial date finally approached there were still processes in place to make it easier for me, the witness. For example, I could choose to give evidence either from behind a screen (so he could not see me) or via a video link. Suzie also took me to meet a smiley lady from Witness Service, who had offered to show me around a courtroom comparable to the one I would be in. She pointed out where I and everyone else (including the jury and, of course, the \"defendant\") would be seated. Suzie also reassured me that it was OK if I couldn't remember every single detail of that evening, that I should simply do my best. After all, by now it was two years since the attack.</p> <p>Then, on the first day of the trial, I got a call from Suzie. I had decided to attend court only on the days I was required to give evidence, so I was at work. I took my phone into the stairwell of the office block and she told me the news: he had changed his plea from not guilty to guilty. A wave of stunned relief washed over me. I would not be required to give evidence, as my attacker would be sentenced in court a few weeks later without the need for a full trial. A few weeks later, on a sunny spring afternoon, the judge handed down a total of 10 years imprisonment. </p> <p>After it was over, I decided that I wanted to write this. To reassure people that rapists can, and do, get caught and convicted. That, in my experience, reporting rape can be a better experience than it is often painted. That there are some wonderful, compassionate people working in our police system. That if all the resources are in place, then the system is a good, if admittedly not a great, one. We need to make it better, yes, but by bashing it in the press with crude statistics and generalisations we do nothing to encourage victims - who are already vulnerable and scared - to come forward and report such crimes. When my attacker forced his way into my flat that night, I don't think he thought that his path would eventually lead to prison. I hope that after writing this, a few more like him might be led in that direction too.</p>",
  "<p>To meet Nicole Cooke this week was to gain a privileged glimpse of a world of happiness known only to a select few. The Welsh woman has spent all her cycle racing career on the hunt for an Olympic gold medal and, having finally achieved her goal, she was still in a blissful state 72 hours later, despite the need to dig deep inside herself in the women's time-trial.</p> <p>As she waited for her team-mate, the time-trial silver-medallist Emma Pooley, to emerge from the anti-doping control, Cooke admitted that fatigue from the adrenalin that had followed her gold- medal win had been partly to blame for her relatively slow ride and her near-collapse afterwards. But she noted that in spite of having keeled over after crossing the line, her state of sheer delight enabled her to jump off the tarmac with a beatific smile on her face.</p> <p>\"I couldn't get to sleep until gone 3am on Sunday. I was just lying there thinking. I had the medal next to me. I just couldn't sleep. I was so happy. The first feeling that I had when I woke up was 'I'm an Olympic champion!' It was so crazy. I didn't think 'What time is it, how do I feel? Oh it's dark, it's light.' It was just 'oooh' and [the happiness] all started again. It was really incredible.\"</p> <p>Trying to assess how she had achieved her life's ambition, Cooke pointed first to the dark period at the end of last year when she had contemplated leaving cycling when her knee did not heal as expected after an operation. A critical influence at this point, she said, was the Swiss time- trial bike designer Andy Walser, who had begun making her machines in 2006, having also worked for Jan Ullrich. </p> <p>\"I thought he was the only person who could relate to the situation I was in. Andy said, 'First of all you are my friend whether you ride or not, don't ever think you have to be a cyclist,' which had been exactly what my parents said. Then he said, 'Let's try to fix it, step by step.' And there was also the support I got from British Cycling. It couldn't have been better because they were giving me their full confidence to plan my season around the Olympics.\"</p> <p>Cooke's relationship with British Cycling had not always been smooth, going back to the point in 2000 when she had been refused entry to the Sydney Olympics on the grounds that she was too young, and she felt that they had not been supportive. Getting that relationship on an even keel had been \"critical\" in enabling her to build up to Beijing in a measured way, she said. First came the decision last September to miss out on the world championships for a knee operation she hoped would end the knee problem that had plagued her since 2004. Then came her inclusion in Team Halfords, which was set up by the Olympic squad primarily to enable her to prepare without the pressure to perform that she felt when riding for a trade squad.</p> <p>\"It was really tough not to do the worlds and then try to get back from the injury, but they said, 'Take your time, it's only the Olympics that count. Just think about getting it right.' To have that security from the British Federation and the Halfords team, the way they were fully supportive in the build-up to our one goal meant I could just take the time that was needed. Having that set-up was the best option for this year, because of the whole lack of pressure.\"</p> <p>Cooke revealed another key influence for the first time yesterday: an Italian coach named Fabio Bartolucci who works with the French professional men's trade team Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com, a squad with a reputation for riding clean. Bartolucci is based in the Italian cycling heartland of Tuscany, in a small village between Siena and Grosseto. It was to Tuscany and Bartolucci that she headed after riding a stage race in Wales in early July, to put the finishing touches to her Olympic preparation.</p> <p>\"I knew I still needed to get back on track. I asked the British team if I could go away and train and they said do what you think is best. Again, that was them showing confidence in me, and in me believing in doing the right thing.\" </p> <p>As for Bartolucci, Cooke said: \"He works on facts and logic. He has a lot of experience, he's been very good.\" During her two-week training camp with the Italian, she said, the work they did was \"no secret\". \"We just did another test. We saw how it compared, how the levels had changed, just tweaked the training to that and then continued with the same. It was quality work, a case of working at the levels I needed and getting good recovery.\"</p> <p>Cooke said she felt that while in the past she had ridden what she termed \"the perfect tactical race\" while riding for professional teams, she had not managed the feat until Sunday in a major championship. \"At races like the world championships there was always a question - 'what if?' - at the back of my mind, because single-handedly I couldn't deal with everything.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, on the other hand, the Welsh racer turned up at a major event with a clear tactical plan and team-mates who could stay with her when the racing reached its toughest phase. In the final moments over the top of the climb, she revealed that she was preparing to attack the field on her own. \"Probably getting towards the top of the climb, if our break had not started to go away I'd probably have made my move then. So that was kind of in the back of my mind - as we went up the climb I was thinking, 'I'm within myself here and I can put in a really hard attack here.'\"</p> <p>The race was a triumph of meticulous preparation but, as Cooke said, she has been used to doing things in detail since her earliest years training with her father. What she has probably not prepared for is the next step. After achieving his Olympic dream in 2004, Bradley Wiggins admitted he had struggled to adjust to real life afterwards. Cooke anticipates no such problem, saying she will \"enjoy it, enjoy it, enjoy it\" for the next four years. In the short term, however, she will fly home and \"go and savour it with the people who really helped me, such as my coach\".</p> <p>Afterwards she will attempt to refocus for the world championships in the Italian town of Varese. Already, however, Cooke is able to contemplate defending her title on British soil in London in 2012. \"It's a dream come true here and to have a chance to do it all over again is fantastic.\"</p>",
  "<p>England are fighting an increasingly lonely battle to protect the status of Test cricket against the onward march of Twenty20 after Australia and South Africa bowed yesterday to Indian pressure to reschedule the inaugural Club Champions League to December and at a stroke challenged the supremacy of the international game.</p> <p>The Club Champions League will now take place between December 3-10, sandwiched between the one-day and Test series between England and India, with the Champions League final scheduled for the night before the start of England's Test series against India in Ahmedabad.</p> <p>It brings the appalling possibility that Mahendra Singh Dhoni could finish a floodlit Champions League final for Chennai Super Kings at 11pm and still be expected to be in Ahmedabad for a Test match by 10am the following morning.</p> <p>If Dhoni, who rivals Sachin Tendulkar as India's most high-profile player, pulled out of either match then the prospects of litigation between TV rights holders is considerable. If he plays in both, he demeans the reputation of top-level cricket. In the face of India's supposedly insatiable appetite for one-day cricket, the game has succumbed to untold levels of greed.</p> <p>The ECB is privately aghast at developments, believing that the future of the international game is now under threat because of desperation to attract the Indian rupee, and would refuse any Indian attempt to push back the Ahmedabad Test even by 24 hours. The second Test in Mumbai follows only four days later, leaving England just enough time to return home by Christmas Eve.</p> <p>An ECB spokesman said: \"We have noted the dates of the Champions League. Test cricket must have primacy as far as the ECB are concerned and nothing has changed. India have long been aware of our views.''</p> <p>The Australian and South African boards both need the Champions League revenue to clear their sizeable debts \u2013 so much so that they have now crammed the Test series between the two top nations in the world into an unprecedented three back-to-back Tests, with the first Test in Perth now delayed until December 17.</p> <p>James Sutherland, Australia's chief executive, claimed that to play three Tests in as many weeks, with minimal rest periods, will not devalue the most eagerly-awaited Test series of the winter, but the demands upon players, fast bowlers in particular, have now reached intolerable levels.</p> <p>\"We took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a defacto World Test Cricket Championship but between Australian and South Africa,\" Sutherland said.</p> <p>Micky Arthur, South Africa's coach, conceded: \"It is a financial decision and must be seen as such. It is not ideal but we have found a compromise in the best interests of South African cricket.''</p> <p>England failed to join India, South Africa and Australia as one of the three founder members of the Club Champions League because they were unhappy with arrangements where India claimed 50 per cent of the revenue and 100 per cent of the influence. That has left them powerless to intervene, expect within the ICC where they will continue to argue that such competitions must come increasingly under ICC control.</p> <p>Middlesex remain England's sole representative in an eight-team tournament which has total prize money of US$6m. Kent, the other qualifiers \u2013 were banned by India because they fielded players with links to the unofficial Indian Cricket League. But Middlesex will have to manage for much, if not all, of the tournament without Andrew Strauss and perhaps Owais Shah. Both, if selected for the Test squad, will be expected to make preparations for the series their priority.</p> <p>Vinny Codrington, Middlesex's chief executive, said: \"I imagine that Andrew would be ruled out, but if Owais is not required for the first Test I am hopeful that the England management would be receptive to him playing. We may look to recruit on a loan basis.''</p> <p>The Club Champions League was originally scheduled to begin on September 29, only for organisers to shift the dates under pressure from the ICC and TV rights holders because the start of the tournament clashed with the reserve date for the final of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.</p> <p>Cricket's future has never been more uncertain, its fixture list never more chaotic and overcrowded. As long as uncurbed power resides with India, which regards last-minute itinerary changes and planning on the hoof as an everyday occurrence, no-one is certain where it may end.</p> <p><strong>Meanwhile </strong>Stanford Superstars - the team who will take on England for a \u00a310m Twenty20 purse - today named their squad for the contest on November 1.</p> <h2>Stanford Superstars</h2> <p><strong>Baker </strong>(Montserrat), <strong>Benn</strong> (Barbados), <strong>Bravo</strong>, <strong>Emrit</strong>, <strong>Mohammed</strong>, <strong>Pollard</strong> (all Trinidad and Tobago), <strong>Chanderpaul</strong>, <strong>Sarwan</strong>, <strong>Cush</strong> (all Guyana), <strong>Fletcher</strong> (Grenada), <strong>Gayle</strong>, <strong>Marshall</strong>, <strong>Powell</strong>, <strong>Taylor</strong> (all Jamaica), <strong>Hampson</strong>, <strong>Joseph</strong> (Antigua and Barbuda), <strong>James</strong> (St Vincent)</p>",
  "<p>Two former England players hit out yesterday and the results were equally entertaining. While Andrew Caddick, 40 in November, rebuked the England and Wales Cricket Board for failing to tap into the experience that brought him 234 wickets in 62 Tests, Marcus Trescothick biffed 158 in 186 balls to overshadow a century from Zander de Bruyn that oozed energy of its own.</p> <p>Surrey ought to escape a rain-ruined match with a draw today, but the truth is they have been an absolute shower. Trescothick's third hundred of the summer was thrillingly unencumbered. His first fifty contained 11 fours, his third came from 31 balls, and while he was carting Pedro Collins for 20 runs in four deliveries, Surrey -bottom of the table -were at his mercy. Dropped on 56 and 131, he finally top-edged a sweep off Saqlain Mushtaq during a pre-tea spell which yielded 123 runs in 18 overs as Somerset made up for lost time.</p> <p>De Bruyn had 109 by the declaration, which allowed Caddick and Co 21 overs to try to eat into a Surrey line-up low on confidence. That may not be a problem. Caddick, who promptly removed Scott Newman for a duck, suffers from himself. He has recovered sufficiently from a 5\u00bd-hour back operation before Christmas to earn a one-year contract for 2009 and yesterday aired his concern about England's fast-bowling set-up with customary candour.</p> <p>\"At the moment [the England seamers] portray themselves as though they think they know it all, and I'm sure they don't,\" he said. \"Don't get me wrong: if they were to ask me, 'Would you have a look at me?', I'd love to. I did a little bit with Andrew Flintoff in South Africa in 1999-2000, but the problem we've got is that the ECB regime tends to look after itself and they're not actually having a good look around. I would love to get involved and I could probably help the likes of [Sajid] Mahmood and [Stuart] Broad.\"</p> <p>Caddick called the decision to rest a tired-looking Broad for the Edgbaston Test while making him available for Nottinghamshire \"an obvious no-brainer\", and his view that there are \"too many bullshitters in cricket\" may not win him much influence in the corridors of power. But he can still bowl and while that remains the case Somerset, in the hunt for a maiden championship title, are grateful to have him.</p> <h2>Yorkshire make hay after Cork has his say</h2> <p>Another wretched day for Lancashire can have done nothing to improve the mood of the committee members who were accused of drinking gin and tonic - quite an insult in these parts - during the captain Stuart Law's outburst on Wednesday.</p> <p>Lancashire were all out on 231 and Adil Rashid grabbed his third haul of five wickets or more this season. Andrew Gale and Anthony McGrath then provided a lesson in application in a less than thrilling, partnership of 215 in 80 overs - until McGrath was given lbw for 99 late in the day.</p> <p>Gale, a left-hander from Dewsbury who played with impressive restraint, grafted on to 111 not out. To make matters even less digestible for those on the committee balcony, the early breakthrough had been made by Dominic Cork, the man whose rejection had caused all the fuss. He won an lbw decision against Chris Taylor and his celebrations were directed very deliberately in the direction of the decision-makers.</p> <p>Lancashire should escape with a draw today but the chairman, Michael Cairns, let it be known that the committee are less than thrilled with Law and will discuss whether to take any action next week.</p>",
  "<p>One of my best friends is a Finn. She came to England at 16, but when it came to giving birth to her first baby 13 years later, there was no hesitation: she went home. When she returned, along with her stories of state of the art healthcare, she brought tangible evidence of the largesse of the Nordic welfare state: each new mother was given a box of exquisite new baby clothes and equipment. Everything was a perfect mint green and lavender. In contrast, when it was my turn several years later to give birth in the UK in an overcrowded, dirty hospital, a harassed nurse handed me a plastic bag stuffed with leaflets advertising baby products and a couple of free samples. In Finland, the state signalled its commitment to the wellbeing of each new citizen with an abundance of gifts; in the UK, it was a crash course in consumer capitalism.</p> <p>Ever since those mint green baby clothes - and the tales of extraordinary maternity and paternity leave established decades before the UK grudgingly conceded anything remotely comparable - I've been intrigued and bewildered by how the Scandinavian model works. I'm not talking about the nuts and bolts of how programmes of health, education and welfare are organised, though successive British politicians have pilfered ideas - most recently David Cameron's interest in Sweden's self-governing, parent-run schools. No, what fascinates me are the cultural expectations and understandings that underpin the political consensus that those countries' huge and expensive welfare states have enjoyed for nearly 50 years.</p> <p>On successive visits to Denmark, Norway and now, just back from two weeks in Finland, I've kept bumping up against the same puzzling phenomenon: a kind of unquestioning assumption of how things should be, a form of social control about the way to behave and one's responsibilities to others. The point when it became starkly apparent in Finland was at Sunday family lunch in a country barn restaurant; every table was full but all you could hear were murmured whispers and the scrape of cutlery on china - until our families arrived, anarchic, squabbling and full of chatter, despite my Finnish friend's attempts to get us to be quiet.</p> <p>\"Everyone knows exactly what you have to do in every circumstance, everyone tries to do it, confident that everyone else is doing it and anyone who fails will be subjected to the justified scorn of everybody,\" says Andrew Brown of the remarkable degree of mutual trust and expectation that characterises Scandinavian social relations. </p> <p>Brown's thought-provoking book on Sweden, Fishing in Utopia, explores how this powerful social fabric has been eroding over the past 25 years. He argues that a set of social relations born from Calvinist protestantism and the intense interdependence of small rural communities is unlikely to outlast the decline of both. Consumerism is a direct challenge to the ingrained self-restraint of countries whose grinding peasant poverty is only at a couple of generations' remove. As Brown points out, credit cards were only allowed in the late 90s.</p> <p>Such restriction on personal freedom was regarded as legitimate to achieve general social wellbeing. Central is the concept of jantelagen, adds Brown, defined as the \"Scandinavian code of egalitarian conformity which absolutely forbids anyone to feel superior to their neighbours\". It's an astonishing contrast to the UK where increasingly it can seem that superiority - and the struggle to achieve it - is the dominant social currency of every type of human interaction, from the rat race of corporate bankers to the knife crime of inner cities.</p> <p>It's easy to romanticise this distinctive political culture and its postwar achievements. It's as close as anywhere to Thomas Jefferson's dream of a democracy built on the virtues of small farmers - independent-minded but with a commitment to the common good. Frequently one encounters its generosity, humanity and deep democratic ethos: in the Danish tradition of pedagogy and its professionalisation of the skills of nurturing human relationships and development; or in the accessibility of nature in Finland, with its tradition of retreating to the woods and lakes for the pleasures of wood-cutting, swimming and fishing. \"Every man's right\" ensures that a Finn can always find a place to pitch a tent and make a fire. Unlike the UK, this is not a landscape controlled by land ownership.</p> <p>But it's not hard to see this conformity can also be stiflingly oppressive. In particular, it struggles to cope with cultural diversity, and at its worst, it can even begin to sound like racism. One Swede in Brown's book talks about the need for 100% \"social control\" in which \"everyone works together\": you could call it consensual authoritarianism, and it is profoundly foreign to most Britons. Despite the persistent illusions of the liberal left, it's part of why the Scandinavian welfare state has been one of the region's least successful exports.<br><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\"><br>m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 8 2008. We mentionned the concept of jantelagen, a Scandinavian code of social conformity, but had previously spelt it \"j\u00e4ntelagen\", with an umlaut, which has an contrary meaning.

  "<p>The seventies rock star and convicted child abuser Gary Glitter is to be deported to Britain next week as soon as he is released from jail in Vietnam after serving almost three years.</p> <p>The 64-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was convicted of obscene acts with two Vietnamese girls aged 10 and 11 in the coastal city of Vang Tau in March 2006.</p> <p>When he lands in Britain Glitter will be interviewed by the police and required to sign the sex offenders' register. He will then have to tell police where he intends to live and notify them if he moves.</p> <p>He may also be monitored by police and the probation service.</p> <p>Le Thanh Kinh, Glitter's solicitor, said the former singer told him a few months ago he had no desire to go back to Britain, but Vietnamese law required he be sent back to his native country.</p> <p>\"Police booked his ticket from Ho Chi Minh City to London and I have paid for the ticket on his behalf,\" said the lawyer.</p> <p>A Vietnamese foreign ministry spokesman, Le Dung, confirmed Glitter was not welcome to stay in the country.

But the spokesman said it was up to him which country he travelled to.</p> <p>Two months ago Glitter told a Vietnamese state newspaper he wanted to travel to Singapore or Hong Kong when released.</p> <p>In the interview with Cong An Nanh (People's Police) newspaper from prison he said he wanted to release a new album and resume his singing career that peaked in 1973.</p> <p>Glitter has served his time in Thu Duc prison north of Ho Chi Minh City, but spent a week in hospital earlier this year after complaining of chest pains.</p> <p>He was convicted of possessing child pornography in the UK in 1999 and served half of a four-month sentence before he moved to Cambodia.</p> <p>But he was expelled from Cambodia after his presence caused uproar and the government deemed he posed \"a threat to the security of a country\".</p> <p>He was arrested in November 2005 as he tried to board a flight to Thailand from Ho Chi Minh City. Glitter was arrested on suspicion of rape of minors, though he was only charged with obscene acts.</p> <p>Glitter had a string of hits in the 1970s including I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am).

  "<p>Thirty years after its premiere, and now trimmed to 90 minutes, Pam Gems' play remains a rickety star vehicle. What matters, essentially, is the calibre of the star. First it was Jane Lapotaire and then Elaine Page. Now the role is taken by the diminutive Argentinian Elena Roger, who outdoes her overpraised Evita to become, astonishingly, the living embodiment of Piaf. </p> <p>Gems' play itself is a sketchy affair. It whisks us through Piaf's origins as a street singer (and walker) in 1930s Belleville, and shows her shooting rapidly to stardom. But, while Gems suggests that Piaf retained her gutsy working-class spirit, she never explains what it was that attracted the loyalty of friends like Cocteau and Dietrich. </p> <p>What Roger brings to the role, however, is a furious energy and the orphaned solitude of stardom. Even if Gems' Piaf does not change much, Roger invests the role with her own physical dynamic. Her trump card is that she sings as well as she acts. Each number is delivered with the right dramatic gesture so that, in L'Accord\u00e9oniste, her splayed fingers simulate the expansive gestures of the instrument-player. Later, in Bravo Pour le Clown, Roger rocks from side to side as if being pulled by invisible strings. Even more sensationally, she brings the number to a climax by careering round the stage and charging at the audience like a wild animal. </p> <p>It is a tremendous performance, buttressed by Jamie Lloyd's production, which punctuates Gems' snapshot scenes with the exaggerated click of a camera shutter. Phillip Browne as Piaf's pugilist lover and Katherine Kingsley as a sanely professional Marlene make their mark in thinly written supporting roles. There was an automatic standing ovation, but I felt it was for Roger's triumphant performance rather than for the play.</p>",

Tarantino\u2019s script puts Hitler in an exploding cinema. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Print Collector/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Quentin Tarantino, the master of bloodbath cinema, is to give his trademark comic-book treatment to the Nazis and the second world war in a film that has stirred controversy even before production has begun.</p> <p>Shooting on the film, which has the working title Inglorious Bastards and which Tarantino has described as an \"in-your-face movie\", is due to start in the Potsdam Babelsberg studios west of Berlin on October 13.</p> <p>But the film project by the US director of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, which is a remake of a 70s war film by Enzo Castellaris, has already created a furious response from German critics. One said the effects of the \"collision\" between pulp fiction and Nazi barbarity were \"completely unpredictable\".</p> <p>The film depicts scalpings, disembowelment and swastikas being engraved in foreheads as a group of American Jewish soldiers are airdropped into Nazi-occupied Europe to wreak revenge on the Germans.</p> <p>Film buffs were yesterday poring over what appeared to be the Tarantino script of the film, which has apparently been leaked and posted on several internet sites. Although film experts said the 167 page \"final draft\" had Tarantino's handprint all over it - including his wobbly handwriting, spelling mistakes (Inglourious Basterds) and grammatical errors - it had not been confirmed as genuine last night. There was speculation that it might have been released as a publicity stunt.</p> <p>What has been confirmed is that Brad Pitt is to play the starring role - Lieutenant Aldo Raine - \"known to the Germans as Apache Aldo ... a hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee\", who leads the group of Nazi-hunters.</p> <p>Early in the film, he tells potential recruits: \"I'm putting me together a special team ... and I need me ... eight - Jewish - American - soldiers ... as a bushwackin', guerrilla army, we're gonna be doing one thing and one thing only, killin' Nazis.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"We will be cruel to the Germans and through our cruelty, they will know who we are,\" ordering his troops to \"git me 100 Nazi scalps\". </p> <p>One of the group, known as \"Bear Jew\", has a reputation for \"bashing Germans' brains in with a baseball bat\". He features in at least one scene. </p> <p>Other stars believed to have been signed up or up for consideration who have flown to Berlin over the past fortnight to meet Tarantino, include Natassja Kinski, Leonardo di Caprio and the German film stars Daniel Br\u00fchl and Til Schweiger.</p> <p>If the script is anything to go by, even by Tarantino's blood-curdling standards the film looks likely to be a stomach-churner. Apart from baseball-bat bashing and skin engravings, we see one German officer being shot in the testicles, as well as scalps being peeled \"like a banana skin\" from others.</p> <p>The pulp fiction treatment is even given to the killing of a Jewish family being harboured by a French dairy farmer, who are machine-gunned to death through the floorboards of their hiding place.</p> <p>\"This is pop culture meets Nazi Germany and the Holocaust with an unprecedented force,\" wrote the film critic of the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, Tobias Kniebe, in an attempt to sum up the explosive effect the film is likely to have in Germany.</p> <p>The trouble is that little distinction is made between Nazi and German, ordinary Wehrmacht soldiers or SS officers, to the extent that if the script is anything to go by, there is no such thing as a good German and all of them have to die. The final scene shows Hitler trapped in an exploding cinema in Paris.</p> <p>There was speculation last night that Tarantino was attempting to upstage Tom Cruise's controversial film Valkyrie, which tells the true story of the German count who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler. The film has been pilloried long before its expected release in February.</p>",
  "<p>Rents will fall by up to 10% this year, according to some of Britain's biggest letting agents, as a wave of properties that owners and developers can't sell have started to flood the rental market. </p> <p>The fall in rents will bring welcome relief to tenants but will squeeze buy-to-let landlords who now face a triple whammy of falling property values, sliding rental income and rising mortgage costs. To add to their misery, the Law Commission this week issued proposals on \"encouraging responsible letting\" that are likely to drive up administrative costs for landlords. </p> <p>The forecast fall in rents will bewilder landlords, given that many who would otherwise be buying are sitting out the property market woes by renting instead. Shouldn't that be pushing up rents? </p> <p>The reality, according to property agents Knight Frank, is that although there is a big rise in the number of people wanting to rent, it has been more than offset by a surge in \"forced landlords\" who, unable to sell, are now placing properties with letting agents. </p> <p>Liam Bailey, head of residential research, says rents in the London area peaked in 2007 and will fall 10% this year. \"The problem is that the volume of tenants has risen by 25%, but the volume of property available for rent has risen by 35%. There is a lot of stock coming in from people who can't sell and who are putting it on the rental market instead. There is a lot of choice out there for tenants.\" </p> <p>Jane Ingram, head of lettings at Savills, says: \"Across the UK we are seeing a lot of people choosing to rent rather than buy, and our offices are very busy. But there has also been a surge in stock, and I would say in some areas [rental] prices have fallen by 10%. In Docklands, in particular, we are seeing an oversupply. Developers have decided not to sell and are putting properties through the lettings market.\"</p> <p>Knight Frank and Savills have a strong bias towards higher-priced lets in London and the south-east, but in the rest of the UK there is growing evidence of a wider slide in rents. According to the Gumtree 2008 rental index issued this week, average rents over the past year have fallen by 0.9% in Leeds, 2.7% in Manchester and 3.5% in Birmingham. However, not all surveys suggest rents are under pressure. Buy-to-let lender Paragon says that, in the past year, rents have risen by 9.3%. </p> <p>Many amateur buy-to-let landlords who poured into the market in 2006 and 2007 may be facing huge losses. Hargreaves Lansdown suggested this week nearly 200,000 buy-to-let mortgages taken out in 2007 may be in negative equity as a result of falling house prices, and that 10,000 are in arrears. </p> <p>\"Recent buy-to-let investors may find themselves facing a 90% capital loss if they borrowed 90% of their property value,\" says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Property investors may be forced to sell up prematurely because interest payments become unaffordable. The real test of affordability is to come in 2009/10 when those who borrowed large sums at relatively cheap rates in 2007 come off two and three-year fixed deals.\"</p> <p>Zoe Mernick, 24, this week rented a flat in Clapham, south London, which the owner had spent months trying to sell. When hunting for a flat, she found many \"forced landlords\" had unrealistic expectations about rents. \"We've seen flats with no kitchens and not even enough space for a packet of breakfast cereal - they assume you only need a microwave and a freezer. Lots had no storage space for clothes, and there was one where the second bedroom was separated from the rest of the flat by a curtain. Some have been overpriced by as much as \u00a3500 a month, because that's what they need to pay the mortgage.\"</p> <p>Her flatmate, Sarah Brewer, says: \"Estate agents tell us they have to follow landlords' instructions even if they are ridiculous. Landlords just aren't adjusting to the market.\"</p>",
  "<p>House prices have doubled in a matter of months. Restaurants are opening alongside the waterside corniche. Oil-rich Kuwaitis are beginning to move in, and trade at the port is booming.</p> <p>Welcome to Basra. </p> <p>This is the remarkably rosy picture of life in Iraq's second city outlined by a senior British military figure today.</p> <p>Major General Barney White-Spunner, just returned from commanding British forces in southern Iraq, claims Basra has been transformed. Less than a year ago, British soldiers were being attacked day and night. A week ago, White-Spunner says, he was having supper in a restaurant on Basra's corniche by the Shatt al-Arab waterway.</p> <p>\"Property prices have more than doubled since March. One house is going for \u00a390,000, a threefold increase,\" he says, referring to the now desirable stretch of the city's riverbank walkway. He talks of the \"return of the diaspora\", with Christians and Sunnis coming back to their Shia-dominated city. Soldiers from the new Iraqi national army had recently built a number of Sunni mosques. And it is not only Basrawis buying property - Kuwaitis and others are helping to push up prices.</p> <p>\"The UK is getting close to what we set out to achieve,\" White-Spunner says, referring to British forces training the Iraqi army's local 14th division and to the Iraqi navy which he describes as \"doing a fantastic job\". </p> <p>Basra's port of Umm Qasr is \"booming\", he says. A total of 30 civilian flights a week now come in to Basra's international airport and 20 major international oil companies are planning to invest in the region.</p> <p>The optimistic message is reflected in plans now being drawn up in the Ministry of Defence to cut the number of British troops in Basra from 4,000 to just a few hundred in the first half of next year.</p> <p>The reason, British military officials say, is greater security. Security is now the main concern for just 7% of Basrawis, according to a recent poll conducted for the MoD. White-Spunner points to a recent statement by the radical shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, that his Mahdi army militia was no longer a military organisation. </p> <p>\"There is a view the militia is going to come back. It's not going to happen. We are not going to see parts of Basra going back to militia control,\" the British general says.</p> <p>Attacks are still likely by special groups - a euphemism for Shia militia rebels - and by extremists and criminal gangs, he adds. But Iraqi security forces say there are no more than 1,500 of them and that they can cope with them without the help of foreign forces.</p> <p>White-Spunner is also sanguine about Iran. Some elements there, he says referring to the Revolutionary Guards, are still smuggling weapons over the border to the \"special groups\", a practice he describes as despicable.</p> <p>However, he adds: \"In the long term, Iran wants a stable democracy in Iraq - a stable neighbour with a Shia majority. In the short term, it is totally legitimate that there is Iranian influence in southern Iraq, culturally and religious.\"</p> <p>The message he wants to convey is that by next year, the Iraqi army and security forces will be able to maintain law and order in Basra and greater security will lead to economic development. Britain will maintain a military presence there after next year but it will be a group of a few hundred simply training Iraqi forces in such skills as command and control, and intelligence gathering. </p> <p>It is an optimistic reading of life in Basra, but local Iraqis tell a different story. \"The assassinations are back, especially in the last two weeks, just like before,\" journalist Abu Hend told the Guardian yesterday.</p> <p>\"Two men on a motorbike have been shooting people and five barbers have been killed in the last week alone. The militiamen and some of the commanders of the Mahdi army are still there. They don't carry weapons in public but they are still there. A few months ago if you wanted to import anything through the port you had to bribe the Mahdi army officials who controlled the port. Now the Iraqi army and the government are in control so you only bribe one official now. There is no work apart from collecting garbage. It doesn't matter if you are an engineer or a college graduate. And you have to bribe someone in the municipality to get work as a street sweeper.\"</p> <p>For high school teacher Abu Mustafa, the main difference now is that Iraqi soldiers fill the streets instead of armed militiamen.</p> <p>\"The Mahdi army doesn't exist publicly but the killers and assassins are still there and people are still getting killed - though less than before. The militiamen are wearing government uniforms. </p> <p>\"The army raids remind us of what the Ba'athists and Saddam's mukhabarat [secret police] used to do. We thought that after Saddam we would be living in a new Iraq but the same system is back. For example, now the directorate of education is controlled by a new militia they've started replacing headteachers with their own men.\"</p> <p>But for labourer Ali Khadem the situation has improved since the Iraqi army entered Basra. \"There is less kidnapping and killing but the militiamen are still there though they are not armed in the streets. There are so many of them they can't arrest them. If they did they'd have to arrest half of Basra. If you are a state employee then life is good, but if you don't have a fixed salary then things are very hard.\"</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this week, Nugzari Jashavili was walking across fields to his house in the Georgian village of Tkviavi. Some 50 metres away, he spotted gunmen approaching his neighbour Gela Chikladze.</p> <p>\"They grabbed him round the shoulder and slit his throat,\" Jashavili said. \"There were five of them. They had arrived from South Ossetia in a jeep. They were going across the village from house to house.\"</p> <p>Jashavili, 65, said he hid in a cornfield. He watched the Chechen and Ossetian irregulars help themselves to his furniture and 100-watt generator. Further down the road, he said, they shot his cousin Koba. They also executed another man, Shamila Okropridze.</p> <p>The irregulars had come from the Russian-controlled South Ossetian capital, Tskinvali, five miles (8km) away. According to the villagers' accounts, the militias, with the apparent support of the Russian army, began a campaign of ethnic cleansing, killing teenage boys, stealing vehicles, looting and burning.</p> <p>There is no way to independently verify these accounts.</p> <p>Russia's president, Dmitry Medevdev, had just announced a ceasefire and a putative end to Moscow's war with Georgia. But fleeing villagers say the Russian-backed militias were exacting revenge on Georgians on both sides of the South Ossetian border north of Gori.</p> <p>\"There are bodies everywhere. I saw hundreds of dead. There are people lying in the streets,\" Elene Maisuradze, 73, said. \"The villages of Kurta, Chala and Eredvi are full of corpses.\"</p> <p>She fled from Tkviavi after gunmen arrived at her home. \"They said in Russian: 'Where are the boys and where is your car?' I didn't understand. One of them was Ossetian and he translated. I told them I'd sold my car and they went away. But then some others turned up.</p> <p>\"They asked me where my basement was, and shot it up. I was crying. They said: 'Kill her, kill her.' My neighbour is a Russian woman and she told them: 'Don't do this.' They fired into the ground instead and said, 'Fuck Saakashvili.'\"</p> <p>It took time for these accounts to emerge, the two days it took for Maisuradze, Jashavili and other survivors to reach Gori on foot. They say they survived by eating peaches, apples and plums; one old woman died on the way.</p> <p>They arrived at the edge of the city yesterday morning, at the same time as the Georgian military. Georgian forces were supposed to take back control of Gori. In reality, the Russian army is refusing to leave, blockading the entrance to the town and the road north with dozens of tanks.</p> <p>While negotiations took place between a Russian general and Georgia's national security adviser, in the nearby mountains black smoke poured from a burning Georgian military base. Every few minutes there was a rumbling explosion. The air smelled of cordite.</p> <p>Negotiations broke down yesterday after the Russians insisted that the South Ossetians run Gori's police force. Local radio stations had been replaced by a Russian channel, My Family, which broadcasts dating tips in Russian.</p> <p>\"My husband died 14 years ago. I wished I had died soon after him,\" Maisuradze said yesterday. She said the gunmen had taken hostage two men with Georgian surnames. Yesterday she was still trudging to Tbilisi. \"I had my childhood during the second world war. The situation was terrible. Now I'm so old and I'm in a war again.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Kremlin yesterday fuelled fears that it was bent on annexing Georgia's two contested provinces when President Dmitri Medvedev met the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and pledged to support and guarantee any decision they took on their status.</p> <p>Eduard Kokoity, the pro-Russian leader of South Ossetia, on Georgia's northern border with Russia, and Sergei Bagapsh, the leader of the separatist western region of Abkhazia, were called to the Kremlin to sign up to the truce terms between Russia and Georgia mediated on Tuesday by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.</p> <p>Medvedev delivered a robust statement of support for the two rebel regions, while Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, flatly dismissed western insistence that Georgia's territorial integrity had to form the basis for any eventual settlement of the conflict.</p> <p>\"We don't want the collapse of Georgia, but the de facto situation is such that neither the South Ossetians nor the Abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them,\" said Lavrov.</p> <p>The breakaway Abkhaz administration said it needed to have a significant Russian \"peacekeeping\" contingent on its soil, indicating that Moscow intends to retain a heavy presence there. </p> <p>President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia said there could be no Russian forces in Abkhazia, although he agreed to a \"temporary\" Russian presence in South Ossetia.</p> <p>But the Russians have routed the Georgians, expelling their forces completely from the two regions, and European Union officials involved in trying to cement a ceasefire say it is realistic to expect the Russians to control the breakaway provinces.</p> <p>Medvedev's statement was a green light to the Abkhaz and South Ossetians to organise votes in their territories which would return verdicts in favour of independence or absorption by Russia.</p> <p>\"I'd like you to know,\" Medvedev told the two leaders, \"that we support any decision taken by the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We will not only support them, but guarantee them in the Caucasus and in the whole world ... Right is on your side.\"</p> <p>Medvedev added that any such decisions should conform with the UN charter and the Helsinki act. </p> <p>While effectively controlling the two provinces, Russia, say analysts, may prefer to leave their status open and unresolved in order to use them as bargaining tools rather than incorporating them into Russia and provoking a bigger international crisis.</p> <p>The Russian statements put Moscow on collision course with the west in seeking a diplomatic settlement to the Caucasus conflict. </p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is to meet Medvedev in Sochi on the Black Sea today. Her spokesman said yesterday it was \"sacrosanct for Germany\" that \"the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia are not called into question in future talks\".</p> <p>But Lavrov insisted that any diplomatic formula that sought to settle the conflict would be \"useless\" if it mentioned Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Any reference to the territorial integrity of Georgia would simply be seen as an insult, a deeply human insult.\"</p> <p>The tentative peace formula unveiled by EU negotiators on Wednesday makes no reference to Georgia's territorial integrity, although a statement issued by EU foreign ministers stressed that any peace pact had to be based on respect for Georgia's recognised borders.</p>",
  "<p>It is a measure of how disposable pop music is and how fickle listeners are that Cathy Dennis is, for many, only half remembered. We might struggle to think of one of her songs, only vaguely recall what she looks like. Yet, she was a star: she had 10 consecutive UK top 40 hit singles in the 1990s and was even more adored in the US and Japan.</p> <p>For anyone still trying to remember, the lyrics \"hold me baby / drive me crazy / touch me / all night long\" should ring some bells.</p> <p>Today she is one of the most important women in the pop industry, as one of its most prolific songwriters. She went into the history books when the song she wrote for Katy Perry, I Kissed A Girl, recently became the 1,000th number one record in the Billboard US charts. Last Sunday the single reached number one in the UK charts and has become one of the songs of the summer. Quite simply, without such talented writers as Dennis the whole mad pop machine would fall apart.</p> <p>The number of pop songs that Dennis has had a hand in is staggering. To name but a few: Toxic by Britney Spears, Never Had a Dream Come True by S Club 7, Anything is Possible by Will Young, About You Now by the Sugababes, Sweet Dreams My LA Ex by Rachel Stevens, and on and on.</p> <p>But there is one song she co-wrote, with former Mud guitarist Rob Davis, that will be the subject of pop culture essays for years to come. Not only did Can't Get You Out of My Head rescue Kylie Minogue's then floundering career in 2001, it is, for many, one of the greatest pop songs ever.</p> <p>\"It's completely brilliant and hypnotic,\" says Peter Robinson, editor of popjustice.com. \"And it's probably something that Kylie will never better. Cathy might though.\"</p> <p>Alexis Petridis, the Guardian's pop music critic, agrees: \"It's the ultimate pop record and it's interesting that it gave Kylie more respect than all her other attempts to make supposedly serious records. Dennis' songs are ostensibly throwaway pop songs but they're not, they're serious. Songs like Toxic completely stick in your head.\"</p> <p>Robinson adds: \"If it says Cathy Dennis in the credits to a song then people will always sit up and listen to it.\" </p> <p>Dennis is from Norwich and spent some of her childhood accompanying her dad and his band as they toured local hotels. She was always a musical child but never imagined she would become a pop star. She once said: \"I come from Norwich. Pop stars don't come from Norwich. All my friends were farmers or children of farmers.\"</p> <p>She briefly worked for Norwich Union before coming on the radar of Simon Fuller, one of the most successful music managers of all time. He was impressed enough with Dennis to put her in the band D-Mob, which had limited success, but Dennis soon went solo, notching up hit after hit and touring the world.</p> <p>In fairness, she never had that extra something as a performer. She was, perhaps, a bit too down-to-earth. She said in one interview: \"I'd rather spend \u00a33.50 on a second-hand skirt than \u00a31,000 on some designer gear which I probably wouldn't wear.\" </p> <p>Petridis believes she was slightly uncomfortable as a pop star. \"She started out as a kind of Kwik Save Kylie and then had an attempt at being a faux indie diva, which didn't work.\" </p> <p>Dennis did not seem to enjoy all the extra stuff you do to be a megastar, either, preferring to live an ordinary life and definitely stay out of the papers. </p> <p>She once said: \"I have no tolerance for beer. I prefer to see a film, read a good book or practise my guitar.\"</p> <p>What she could do was write. Incredibly well. Through Fuller Dennis wrote Bumper to Bumper for the Spice Girls and then became heavily involved in the S Club 7 project, Fuller's brainchild after the Spice Girls sacked him in 1997. The group, four girls and three boys, had a string of hits and their own TV show. The band was as cheesy and manufactured as was possible, but very popular, with a string of annoyingly catchy hits.</p> <p>Since then Dennis has remained close to the Fuller empire, involved in Pop Idol and American Idol by writing the themes and songs for singers such as Will Young, Gareth Gates, Clay Aiken and Kelly Clarkson.</p> <p>Dennis has found her niche. She is a writer for hire and this has made her rich beyond her dreams. She is also a top player in a sector dominated by men. </p> <p>Many assumed this would be it for Dennis. She would keep churning songs and maybe win a few more Ivor Novello songwriting awards, of which she has five already. </p> <p>But last month she said: \"I've been working for the last year-and-a-half with a band I put together called Sexcassettes. We're shooting a video for the first single, Killer Love, this month, and I hope to have it out by the end of the year. It has more of a band sound than produced pop. As usual, I have no idea what to expect.\" </p> <p>The truth is, nor does anyone else.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> March 25 1969 in Norwich</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Taverham high school</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Not married </p> <p><strong>Career</strong> At 13 Dennis started singing in her father's band, the Alan Dennis Band. She briefly worked in the pensions department at Norwich Union before she was spotted by Simon Fuller and signed to Polydor Records, aged 17. In 1989 had first chart success with acid-house band D-Mob and the song C'Mon and Get My Love. In 1990 she released her debut album, Move To This, which gave her three US top 10 hits. She made two further albums, but has focused on songwriting since the late 90s. She has won five Ivor Novello awards, for such hits as Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You Out of My Head and Britney Spears's Toxic.</p>",
  "<p>It's summer in the gentle Suffolk seaside resort of Southwold and Adnams ale is flowing freely in the brewery's four pubs and two hotels in the town. In the afternoon sunshine, executive chairman Jonathan Adnams can sometimes be heard practising bluegrass banjo on the East Green, a patch of grass in front of the brew house.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Gordon Brown picked this remote spot for his summer break. A stroll along the beach and a quiet pint of Adnams Bitter, Broadside or Explorer, can make the worries of the wider economy feel a long way away.</p> <p>In conversation, Adnams refers three times to \"the outside world\". The phrase, which also crops up in the group's annual report, hints at the mind-set at the eponymous family-controlled minnow. The company, with a market capitalisation of about \u00a352m, jostles for the attention of a dozen or so multibillion-pound pub and supermarket groups that dominate the national drinks trade.</p> <p>Making Adnams' task even more difficult over the past 10 years has been the rapid rise of two powerful regional brewery groups which have been transformed into insatiable pub-acquisition engines. One is Midlands-based Marston's, the other, which has headquarters 50 miles inland from Southwold at Bury St Edmunds, is Greene King. Since 1996 Greene King has acquired 2,200 pubs in Britain, taking its total to 2,600. Adnams has 78.</p> <p>At first the chairman blocks talk of his powerful neighbours. \"I'm not here to talk about Greene King,\" he says abruptly. But it is hard to articulate the challenges facing the company without mention of the competition.</p> <p><strong>Lockout</strong></p> <p>Before long, Adnams returns to the subject, sketching out how he sees his neighbours' business model. \"What that does is 'lock out',\" he says. \"You buy pubs, you paint them green [Greene King] or you paint them red [Marston's], and you then brew the cask beer and you lock everything else out - that's very much the Greene King model. You buy all the pubs you can and you lock every other producer out.\"</p> <p>The subject is a sore one and only in passing does Adnams suggest that \"perhaps it is something the government ought to look at\", recalling the 1989 Beer Orders that were supposed to unravel the dominance of brewery groups.</p> <p>At the end of June, Adnams, which is listed on the junior Plus Market, issued a profits warning, telling investors half-year profits would be \"substantially lower\" than the previous year. The chairman said Adnams was \"heavily exposed\" in a contracting ale market because it had few pubs of its own.</p> <p>Passionate as he is about the family business, in his early years Adnams showed little ambition for the life of a beer baron. \"I wasn't particularly keen on school and my father said: 'Get an offer to do something else and you can leave.' So I left school at 16 and went fishing for a year.\" </p> <p>Even as a schoolboy, he had spent much of his summer holidays working on a dredger. \"My parents used to wave me goodbye with two pounds of bacon for the galley and I'd help crew the gravel barges taking the aggregate from Southwold to other places. The whole thing was run on a shoestring. It was a bit like Fred Karno's army - the barges were either sinking, breaking adrift, or crushing somebody else's boat ... It was a wonderful experience for somebody of 14, 15, 16.\"</p> <p>Aged 19, Adnams returned and joined the firm, starting as an apprentice engineer, while juggling his day job with what became a 27-year commitment as a lifeboat man. Re-engaging with education through part-time courses, he built the skills to progress to more senior roles in the company. </p> <p>By the mid-1990s another strong personality emerged at the helm of Adnams - Simon Loftus, a Cambridge-educated wine buff and author, whose family had been significant minority investors in Adnams for more than 90 years. At that time the business seemed to be in terminal decline, so it fell to Loftus to set a course that would mark Adnams apart from the staid traditions that were destroying so many regional brewers. A pioneer in corporate social responsibility and corporate transparency, Loftus shaped a modern vision for the firm, encapsulated in a corporate motto - \"Doing the right thing\" - which may seem a little quaint now, but at the time was revolutionary.</p> <p>Loftus, by then working closely with Adnams, who had risen to managing director, began building a name for the small brewery. By the time Adnams took over as chairman in 2006, the pair had doubled sales and quadrupled profits. </p> <p>While new bottled ales, and chilled and filtered beers can upset cask-ale enthusiasts, they helped the Adnams name burst on to the national stage, with listings in supermarkets and contracts with the country's largest landlord groups, Punch Taverns and Enterprise Inns. Adnams is now served in about 5,000 pubs in Britain.</p> <p>One of the most visible legacies of Loftus's chairmanship is a hi-tech energy-efficient brewing facility, painstakingly constructed so as not to spoil the Victorian terrace-cottage facade that forms one side of the Sole Bay brewery in the centre of Southwold. Inside, Adnams likens the computer-controlled machinery to the Starship Enterprise.</p> <p>\"We're not sitting here saying: 'Look at our wonderful old brewery. My grandad used that.' It might have been wonderful 100 years ago, but the world's moved on. And that's our whole mind-set. Some regional brewers can be quite paternalistic - traditional, with things rooted in yesteryear. And they very much pervade that. I'm not knocking it; that's their style. But I think that's very much not our style here.\"</p> <p>Adnams' newly built warehouse in a disused gravel pit is another sight to behold. Built with bricks made from compressed hemp, the 1,200sq metre (13,000sq ft) depot is capped with a curved roof covered in flowering sedum that covers the 13m high structure. The project cost Adnams about 20% more than a conventional warehouse but its construction and operation saved heavily on its carbon footprint. </p> <p>Building on these initiatives, in April Adnams launched a bottled brand called East Green Carbon Neutral, the first product to carry an endorsement from the government-backed Carbon Trust.</p> <p>While awards and plaudits are piling up, Adnams is aware the trading climate for his core beer sales is as unforgiving as it has ever been. Last week Liverpool brewery Cains - another producer with few pubs behind it - was forced to call in administrators. </p> <p><strong>Values</strong></p> <p>The corporate values that have set Adnams apart will be tested to the full in the next two years as the economy slows and the pub trade shrinks. Its chairman, whose family has owned the Southwold brewery since 1872, talks of a \"tipping point\" having been reached in beer sales this spring. As a result he has halted expansion plans for the firm's wine and kitchenware chain, Cellar &amp; Kitchen. A target of doubling profits over five years has also been scrapped.</p> <p>Although Adnams is confident he has the support of the majority of investors who control company votes in the firm's two-tier share structure - largely family members - he acknowledges that as the trading environment worsens there will be pressure from some investors, most notably Guinness Peat, which has a stake of almost 9%.</p> <p>\"In these difficult times there will be some of our shareholders who think short-term gain is better. But it is really about what the majority want. For many years, our ethos has been to run the company for the long-term sustainable benefit of all stakeholders. Our strategy hasn't changed, it's only the pace that has. It's not an expansionist game today, it's a defensive game. Probably will be for the next two years.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong></p> <p>November 25 1956, Suffolk</p> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>Framlingham College; estate management at Southampton Technical College</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>1973</strong> Left school at 16 to become a deep-sea fisherman</p> <p><strong>1975</strong> Joined Adnams as apprentice engineer, quickly moving into distribution management</p> <p><strong>1988</strong> Director of pubs and distribution</p> <p><strong>1997</strong> Managing director</p> <p><strong>2006</strong> Executive chairman</p> <p><strong>Family</strong></p> <p>Single</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong></p> <p>Bluegrass banjo, sailing and learning Lithuanian</p>",
  "<p>British Airways unveiled an alliance with American Airlines and Spain's Iberia yesterday that will allow the three carriers to agree fares and schedules - prompting warnings from rival Virgin Atlantic that passengers will face higher ticket prices.</p> <p>BA must convince officials in Washington and Brussels that the agreement to cooperate on flights between North America, Mexico and Europe will not lead to fare rises and distort the crucial London-New York market. Virgin Atlantic laid down a marker as the deal's most vehement opponent yesterday, when the airline's founder, Sir Richard Branson, warned yesterday that the alliance would be a \"monster monopoly\".</p> <p>BA's chief executive, Willie Walsh, said the partnership would give British customers more reliable and cheaper journeys to American destinations. \"There is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this. For the consumer, it means they will have access to a much bigger network. We will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares,\" he said. </p> <p>Passengers on transatlantic routes would be able to choose between BA and AA fares when booking flights, Walsh said, allowing them to select the cheapest fare for both legs of a return journey. \"There will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with AA outbound and taking a fare with BA on the inbound leg.\"</p> <p>It is the third attempt by BA to forge an alliance with the second-largest airline in the US, six years after the previous attempt foundered when the European commission demanded the sale of 32 take-off and landing slots at Heathrow as a concession.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, BA's fiercest rival in the UK-US market, warned that the deal would give BA and AA control over nearly two-thirds of one of the most lucrative markets in aviation: Heathrow to New York's JFK airport. \"Make no mistake, if this monster monopoly is approved it will be third time unlucky for consumers. It will still be bad for passengers, bad for competition, and bad for the UK and US aviation industry,\" said Branson.</p> <p>Walsh hit back, claiming that the airline industry was now \"completely different\" because the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic airline market had created a competitive market in Heathrow-US flights. The Open Skies treaty in March replaced an agreement that limited the Heathrow-JFK route to four airlines. \"This is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001. Anybody can come in and compete,\" said Walsh, who added that nine airlines now operated between Heathrow and the US.</p> <p>BA is the biggest carrier at Heathrow, owning 42% of the take-off and landing slots, but Walsh ruled out selling some to appease regulators. BA will argue that two global airline alliances, Skyteam and Star Alliance, already have anti-trust immunity for transatlantic flights, allowing Air France-KLM and Germany's Lufthansa to cooperate over capacity, scheduling, networks and fares with their respective partners, United Airlines and Delta.</p> <p>\"We have seen Open Skies and we have seen the effects,\" Walsh said. \"The other two alliances have anti-trust immunity. The issue of competition between the alliances is much more relevant than it was in 2001 and we have a changed industry environment. Things have changed sufficiently for us to apply with confidence this time.\"</p> <p>Walsh added that there had been no preliminary discussions with AA over a full-blown merger, which is currently prohibited under ownership guidelines. BA is already in merger discussions with Iberia to form a \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.96bn) airline but the deal could take up to a year to complete.</p> <p>The flag carriers Finnair and Royal Jordanian are also applying for anti-trust immunity as part of the alliance, but the inquiry by the US department of transportation and the EU competition directorate is expected to focus on the transatlantic market.</p> <p>Discussing commercially sensitive information such as fares and scheduling between airlines is illegal unless it is given prior blessing by competition authorities. Without anti-trust clearance, carriers can face price-fixing charges, as BA found when it was fined more than \u00a3270m by US and UK regulators last year for colluding with Virgin Atlantic over fuel surcharges.</p>",

  "<p>Washington last night ruled out using military force in Georgia after putting the Pentagon in charge of the delivery of aid to the invaded Black Sea state and US non-combat troops on the ground. Robert Gates, the defence secretary, said he saw no prospect of the US engaging militarily in the Caucasus conflict, but warned that Russia's invasion of Georgia could set back its relations with the west for years.</p> <p>He added that Washington wanted to avoid a return to cold war-style confrontation with Moscow.</p> <p>But the east-west climate, already chilly because of the Georgia conflict, plunged further last night when Washington and Warsaw put aside a year of dispute and agreed to station 10 interceptor rockets at missile silos in Poland as part of the US missile defence shield in the Baltic region. </p> <p>As part of the deal, the Americans will reportedly supply Poland with Patriot missiles, build a permanent US military base in the country, and provide mutual security guarantees.</p> <p>The deal will enrage Moscow, which is vehemently opposed to the US facilities in Poland and a radar station in the neighbouring Czech Republic. </p> <p>While the Americans say the shield is aimed at Iran, the Russians insist it is directed at them. Moscow has pledged to retaliate and has warned of a new arms race.</p> <p>The missile shield agreement came in the midst of the worst crisis in Moscow's relations with the west since the end of the cold war. </p> <p>A week into the crisis in the Caucasus, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, is expected in the Georgian capital Tbilisi today to rally \"the free world's support for a free Georgia\", after criticism that the Bush administration had been slow to respond to the Russian attack on the region's key US ally.</p> <p>Despite a French-brokered ceasefire agreement three days ago that required Russian and Georgian forces to retire to pre-conflict positions, Moscow's forces remained deep in what was Georgian-controlled territory yesterday, well outside the two contested provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where the Russians were stationed as \"peacekeepers\".</p> <p>The Russians remained in control of the town of Gori, straddling the main road north of Tbilisi, of Senaki to the west, and were in the Black Sea port of Poti, all home to major Georgian military facilities.</p> <p>Moscow said it did not know when it would pull out. \"We are planning it. It depends on many factors. I can't give you the date. We have stopped building up troops,\" Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, Russia's deputy chief of staff, told reporters in Moscow.</p> <p>Gates said last night there were signs that Russia was withdrawing to the two pro-Russian breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <p>The US landed a second large military transport plane with relief aid in Tbilisi after George Bush warned the Russians not to obstruct the aid effort.</p> <p>Bush's tough statement encouraged speculation that the US military could come into dangerously close contact with the Russians, raising the risk of clashes. Such fears were heightened by President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, who claimed that the Pentagon was taking control of Georgian ports and airports.</p> <p>The US dismissed such claims. \"We are not there to defend the ports, we are there to provide humanitarian aid,\" a White House spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said.</p> <p>The signs were that the Kremlin would effect a retreat, satisfied that it had achieved its war aims and the better to control and dominate the diplomatic mediation effort that is gathering steam.</p> <p>In Tbilisi today, Rice will attempt to bolster the embattled Georgians in the diplomatic tussle launched by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France on Tuesday which resulted in a six-point ceasefire and peace plan.</p> <p>Rice met Sarkozy in France yesterday to attempt to toughen the mediation process being conducted by the French on behalf of the EU. \"The United States of America stands strongly, as the president of France just said, for the territorial integrity of Georgia,\" Rice said pointedly, alongside Sarkozy.</p> <p>Presenting the ceasefire terms in Moscow on Tuesday night, Sarkozy had signally refused to support Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Georgia is an independent and sovereign state and I think this formula, the principle of sovereignty, is broader than the formula of territorial integrity,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Thursday, 2.50am ...</strong> The monkey animations with Damon Albarn's Chineasy listening music are beginning to get annoying, certainly at this time in the morning. What the hell am I doing up? Watching swimming. </p> <p>First comes a quick interview with Mark Foster, team GB's oldest swimmer, as BBC1's Garry Richardson keeps reminding him. Garry wonders how Mark manages to communicate with his team-mates, \"because a few of them you probably can't properly converse with they're so much younger\". Garry's good value like that. Kosuke Kitajima from Japan wins a gold medal, but foolishly allows the green world record line to slip ahead of his fingers right at the end. Loving the green line. </p> <p><strong>4am</strong> I've switched to women's archery, America v Colombia. The American used to be a Georgian; they could probably use some of her sharp-shooting back home right now. It's amazing how much an arrow wobbles in the air, when it's shown slowed down. Makes a mockery of the phrase \"straight as an arrow\". Strangely beautiful, though. </p> <p><strong>5am</strong> The beach volleyball from Chaoyang Park has no commentary at all. Is that because the BBC doesn't have anyone who understands, or because they're not taking it seriously? If it's the latter, then they're right not to. Beach volleyball is something you do on holiday. It should no more be an Olympic sport than doing the Macarena or casual sex.</p> <p><strong>6am</strong> Fell asleep, sorry.</p> <p><strong>7am</strong> Hazel and Adrian (Irvine and Chiles) are wearing the same lilac shirts and beige trousers. Synchronised dressing. They're the best anchors, with the right mix of gravitas (Hazel) and larking about (Adrian). Plus a Scot and a Brum is a lovely combination. And here's another Brum, Hugh Porter, who can always find another gear in a cycling commentary (you can't help doing that kind of thing when talking about this lot, because they do it all the time: Hazel came up with the best, something about a Japanese butcher's son slicing a tranche off the world record). And from Qingdao, another Scot, Shirley Robertson, has the sailing news. There isn't any: no wind. Poor Shirley, having to report on Britain's Yngling crew, who dropped her. Like commentating on an ex and the ex's new lover.</p> <p><strong>8am</strong> Steve Ovett! A childhood hero, on the sofa with Adrian and Hazel. Always - and still - so much more human than Seb Coe. Still needs to sort out the teeth, though.</p> <p><strong>9am</strong> Both the rowing and the canoeing have been cancelled, because of rain. That's pathetic. So no boating action at all this morning. Judo instead. Our Peter Cousins is getting a pummelling from a Georgian called Zhorzholiani. No wonder they're not doing very well in their war; they're all here in Beijing, doing marginal sports.</p> <p><strong>10am</strong> Ah badminton. Very different from the rather gentle game I thought it was. Amazing. A Polish pair against a Chinese pair; guess who wins. It's a lovely noise, the thwang of taut strings on shuttlecock. </p> <p><strong>11am</strong> Another gold for China, in the bow and arrows. And then we fly low over the city, in a CGI, Google Earth kind of way, to the basketball stadium. Which is fun - more fun than the basketball when we get there: Lithuania v Russia. Who cares? I never thought I'd miss rowing. </p> <p><strong>Noon</strong> Mark Foster fails to make the semis: too old, or still hurting from Garry Richardson's interview. \"Thank you for all your hard work over the years,\" Sharron Davies (or Amazon off Gladiators if you prefer) says to him after the race. Presumably they now put him down. </p> <p>It's approaching dusk in Beijing, visible behind Sue Barker, whose watch we're now on. Sue's neither a Scot, nor a Brummie, which is a shame. Devon, apparently, though you'd guess Surrey. </p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Badminton - my new favourite sport. And plucky Brits Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms are about to go out to a pair of Koreans, both called Lee. \"Come on,\" says Gill Clark, commentating. \"Time to step up to the plate.\" They don't, and lose to the Lees. Gail's crying. I'm crying. I hate badminton. There's Princess Anne in the crowd. Extraordinary hair. What's she doing there? </p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> Shouldn't she be here, at the dressage? Sideways dancing horses; now there's a proper sport. \"Don't be stupid, just relax,\" barks Jennie Loriston-Clarke, my favourite commentator of all. I think she's talking to Mistral H\u00f8jris, the horse, rather than Laura Bechtolsheimer, his rider. There's a problem, apparently, with a discipline called the passage. Passage is pronounced to rhyme with massage, as you'd expect in a sport called dressage, which doesn't rhyme with message.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> Hockey. Can't face it. Twelve hours. I've had enough.</p>",
  "<p>The murky abyss of Pakistani politics has been especially murky over recent months, and true to form it just keeps getting murkier. The one thing that is absolute when dealing with the dregs that run my country is this: nothing is ever as it seems. Nowhere is that more true than in the current scenario involving President Musharraf's likely impeachment by the ruling coalition.</p> <p>\"It has become imperative to move for impeachment,\" barked Benazir Bhutto's widower, Asif Zardari, at a press conference in Islamabad last week. Sitting beside the new head of the Pakistan People's party was Nawaz Sharif, twice formerly prime minister of Pakistan. Zardari snarled every time Musharraf's name came up, seething with political rage and righteousness, while Sharif did his best to keep up with the pace of things. He nodded sombrely and harrumphed every once in a while. The two men are acting for democracy, you see. And impeaching dictators is a good thing for democracies, you know.</p> <p>But Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari are unelected. They're not just unrepresentative in that they don't hold seats in the parliament - they have absolutely no mandate in Pakistan. They head the two largest, and most corrupt, parties in the state but hold no public office. Pots and kettles.</p> <p>The rest of the coterie that wields power behind this administration, the attorney general and the interior minister for instance, also happen to be unelected. They serve, and I use the term ever so lightly, by appointment only. Some 170 million Pakistanis have lived under military rule of law for nine years. Musharraf stepping down from his army post has not changed that. Neither did the recent selections. Sorry, I meant elections, obviously.</p> <p>The current administration - a party coalition comprising two formerly mortal enemies, the PPP and the PML - has enjoyed five months in office. And what has this thriving democratic union accomplished? It passed the National Reconciliation Ordinance, an odious piece of legislation that wipes out 15 years' worth of corruption cases against politicians, suspiciously covering 11 years of PPP and PML rule. Bankers and bureaucrats were also given the all-clear. Worse still, the ordinance contains a clause that makes it virtually impossible for future charges to be filed against sitting parliamentarians. </p> <p>But they must have done more than that, surely? Well, all that really changed is that food inflation has accelerated, oil subsidies have been cut, gas prices have doubled, and those pesky militants in the Swat district the tribal regions have turned up the fighting. Several days before the decision to impeach Musharraf hurtled through the airwaves, a small story came in from the tribal areas: the militants are close, the story said, they've vowed to target the government, even to the point of attacking state schools. This is a civil war, the story said. </p> <p>So what does the government do when its country appears to be tearing apart at the seams? Go on the attack. Impeach the tyrant. \"The period of oppression is over for ever,\" declared the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, at an event marking 61 years of Pakistani independence yesterday. \"Dictatorship has become a story of the past.\" Deny everything. Nothing is wrong, democracy is good and we hate dictators. Well done.</p> <p>Pakistan is a sovereign country. We are a proud, resourceful, independent nation. We have options. Zardari is not an option. Sharif is not an option. The army is not our one and only option. The mullahs have not become an option yet. There are close to 200 million of us: I'm sure we can think of something better. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fatima Bhutto is a poet and a columnist for the News in Pakistan </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:fatima.bhutto@gmail.com\">fatima.bhutto@gmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The death of John MacDougall MP this week - and the consequent byelection in his Glenrothes constituency in Fife - confronts Gordon Brown with a decision of considerable delicacy as well as one with major political implications. Get it right, and the prime minister may live on to fight another day against his critics. Get it wrong, and Brown could hand his enemies the opportunity without which they probably cannot bring him down. It is not an exaggeration to say that the future of the Labour party will partly depend on the choice that he makes.</p> <p>The key question right now for Brown is the timing of the new byelection. The rules that govern such matters are elastic but, broadly speaking, Labour can call the Glenrothes byelection any time between now and the middle of November. Once the election writ is moved, the campaign normally takes around three weeks. In practice, therefore, polling day in Glenrothes could currently be on any Thursday between September 11 and December 4. </p> <p>On the face of things, it would seem far better for Brown to delay the byelection than to call it quickly. After all, it is a mere three weeks since Labour, having called the Glasgow East byelection at the earliest possible date, was humbled there by the Scottish National party on a swing of 22.6% in the third safest Labour seat in Scotland. Since then, a YouGov poll north of the border has shown the SNP with a 19-point national lead over Labour. In the current mood there is no such thing as a safe Labour seat in Scotland.</p> <p>Certainly not in Glenrothes, anyway. The SNP already has a strong record of recent success in Fife council elections in the Glenrothes area. It captured the nearly equivalent Fife Central seat from Labour in the Scottish parliament elections in 2007. The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives already trail far behind. To win Glenrothes, the SNP needs a swing of 14.5%, a big swing in ordinary times but a modest target in comparison with its heroics in Glasgow East. Everything therefore points to an SNP triumph in the nextdoor seat to Brown's own.</p> <p>By delaying, therefore, Brown would at least give himself time to work some kind of change in the political weather. Delay would allow his autumn economic package, with its rumoured largesse on fuel bills to child benefit claimants and its possible stamp duty holiday to boost the housing market, to take effect in minds and wallets. Delay might allow the recent easing of the oil price to continue and to feed through into a more general sense that the worst of the recession may be over. Delay could enable Brown to strengthen his government in a reshuffle, or to bolster his authority with a strong conference season performance. Alternatively, something may just turn up.</p> <p>Delay might also give Brown the whip-hand over his Labour cabinet challengers. What challenger is likely to step forward in the face of accusations that their action could endanger or doom Labour's chances in Glenrothes? Only a braver one than any of the possible candidates has yet seemed to be, I suspect. As long as Brown retains the byelection card in his hand, he can use it as a deterrent against those who want him to quit.</p> <p>The case for limited delay could suggest a date of October 16, which would deny the SNP the benefit of publicity from its annual conference, which starts in Perth on that date, and ensure that polling took place before the clocks go back on October 26. On the other hand, October 16 falls in Fife's autumn two-week school holiday break, which could affect turnout. All this points to a very late byelection, perhaps as late as the end of November or even early December. In those circumstances, moreover, even if Labour loses in Glenrothes, Brown could try to ensure that any ugly postmortems and possible leadership plots might become tangled up in the Christmas recess. </p> <p>Point proved? Not quite. For one thing, delaying a byelection goes against current Labour instincts about such matters, which are haunted by the loss of Brent East to the Liberal Democrats in 2003 - a byelection loss now put down by the party to the three-month gap between the death of Labour's Paul Daisley and polling day. Modern byelections have to take place quickly, one former Labour manager argued to me before Glasgow East. Going early maximises your own control, minimises your own weaknesses, denies your opponents time, and, if you lose, it gets the bad news out of the way. </p> <p>This last is a potent factor in any calculations about Glenrothes. If, in the real world, Labour is bound to lose there, then what is the advantage of delaying? In the wake of Glasgow East, nobody expects Labour to hold Glenrothes, so would it not be best - or least worst - to just take the hit?</p> <p>The crucial political question about Glenrothes is whether a defeat there will trigger a challenge to Brown. There are no easy answers, but the impact of a November defeat in Glenrothes on a relaunched, reshuffled and even modestly resurgent Labour party would in my view be much more damaging to Brown than the impact of a September defeat on a Labour party fully braced for the loss and ready, in the aftermath, to stand by its leader as he attempts to turn things around.</p> <p>None of this, let's be clear, does much, if anything, to address Labour's central current problem. That problem, as a former minister graphically puts it, is that the electorate now thinks of Brown in the same way as a householder who sees an unwelcome visitor through the spyhole in the front door when the bell rings. At first, the householder just refuses to answer the door. But if the same visitor simply goes on ringing the same bell, the householder will go to any lengths to get rid of him. Labour's challenge is to work out how to persuade the electorate to answer the door. That's partly about the face they see through the spyhole, but in the end it is even more about the message he brings.</p> <p>Seen from now, in the middle of August 2008, Labour seems willing to allow Brown another chance to ring the bell on its behalf. In my view that is a piece of self-indulgence Labour cannot afford. Yet if I am wrong, as I may be, and the Brown strategy is to have some chance of succeeding - however modestly such success must now be defined - then Labour has to find a way of taking the electorate's punch in Glenrothes and not allowing that punch to lay it on the canvas. That way is to hold the byelection at the earliest possible, if ominous, date: September 11.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Russia's invasion of Georgia strikes at the heart of western values and our 21st-century system of security. If the international community allows Russia to crush our democratic, independent state, it will be giving carte blanche to authoritarian governments everywhere. Russia intends to destroy not just a country, but an idea.</p> <p>For too long we underestimated the ruthlessness of the regime in Moscow. Within 24 hours of agreeing to a ceasefire, Russia's forces were rampaging through Gori; blocking the port of Poti; sinking Georgian vessels; and - worst of all - brutally purging Georgian villages in South Ossetia. The Russian leadership cannot be trusted - and this hard reality should guide the west's response. Only western peacekeepers can end the war.</p> <p>Russia also seeks to destroy our economy and is bombing factories, ports and other vital sites. Accordingly, we need to establish a modern version of the Berlin airlift. The United Nations, the US, Canada and others are moving in this direction, for which we are deeply grateful.</p> <p>As we consider what to do next, understanding Moscow's goals is critical. It aims to satisfy its imperialist ambitions, to erase one of the few democratic, law-governed states in its vicinity - and, above all, to demolish the post-cold war system of international relations in Europe. It is showing that it can do as it pleases. </p> <p>The historical parallels are stark: Russia's war on Georgia echoes events in Finland in 1939, Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. Perhaps this is why so many eastern European countries, which suffered under Soviet occupation, have voiced their support for us. Russia's leaders see us as a threat because Georgia is a free country whose people have elected to integrate into the Euro-Atlantic community. But Russia's rulers do not want their nation or its borders contaminated by democratic ideas.</p> <p>Since our democratic government came to power after the 2003 Rose revolution, Russia has used economic embargoes and closed borders to isolate us, and has illegally deported thousands of Georgians. It has tried to destabilise us politically with the help of criminal oligarchs. It has tried to freeze us into submission by blowing up vital gas pipelines in midwinter. When all that failed to shake the Georgian people's resolve, Russia invaded.</p> <p>Last week Russia, using its separatist proxies, attacked several peaceful, Georgian-controlled villages in South Ossetia. On August 6, just hours after a senior Georgian official travelled to South Ossetia to attempt negotiations, a massive assault was launched on Georgian settlements. Even as we came under attack, I declared a unilateral ceasefire in the hope of avoiding escalation, and announced our willingness to talk to the separatists by any means.</p> <p>But we then learned that columns of Russian tanks and troops had crossed Georgia's sovereign borders. The thousands of troops, tanks and artillery massed on our border are evidence of how long Russia had been planning this aggression. Our government had no choice but to protect the country from invasion, secure our citizens and stop the bloodshed. </p> <p>For years Georgia has been proposing 21st-century, European solutions for South Ossetia, including full autonomy guaranteed by the international community. Russia has responded with crude, 19th-century methods.</p> <p>It is true that Russian power could overwhelm our small country - though even we did not anticipate the ferocity and scale of Moscow's response. However, we had to try to protect our people: any democratic country would have done the same.</p> <p>Facing this brutal invading army, our government decided to withdraw from South Ossetia, declare a ceasefire and seek negotiations. However repeated attempts to contact senior Russian leaders were rebuffed. Russia's foreign ministry even denied receiving our notice of ceasefire hours after it was officially - and very publicly - delivered. This was just one of many cynical ploys to deceive the world and justify further attacks.</p> <p>This war threatens not only Georgia but security and liberty around the world. If the international community fails to take a resolute stand, it will sound the death knell for the spread of freedom and democracy everywhere. Georgia's only fault in this crisis is its wish to be an independent, free and democratic country. What would western nations do if they were punished for the same aspiration?</p> <p>I have staked my country's fate on the west's rhetoric about democracy and liberty. As Georgians come under attack, we must ask: if the west is not with us, who is it with? If the line is not drawn now, when will it be drawn? We cannot allow Georgia to become the first victim of a new world order as imagined by Moscow.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mikheil Saakashvili is the president of Georgia </p> <p>\u00a9 Washington Post</p>",
  "<p> Welcome to another week of Chatterbox action, where gaming takes a distant second place to matters of the stomach - or more accurately, pie-eating. With Olympics chatter and other topical subjects eventually bobbing about, the real question of the week turns out to be - will an APC be useful when the zombies come?</p> <p>The answer may surprise you...</p> <p>Friday kicks off with pies and to be honest never really moves on. Which is the best pie? <em>Where</em> is the best pie? Can there be such a thing as a vegetarian pie? The rules, it turns out, are stringent. \"I cannot accept Shepherds pie as a true pie,\" complains Milkncheese. \"It lacks the requisite pastry shell to truly be considered worthy of the name. I see it more as some kind of relative of the lasagna.\" After several hours of heated debate, <a href=\"http://www.aslr46.dsl.pipex.com/\">Pieminister pies</a> of Bristol come in for special commendation.</p> <p>Next, hangover cures come in for analysis - paracetamol or ibuprofen? With juice? Or coffee? Or nothing? Considering that the risks apparently include liver failure and/or gut rot, it may be best just to stay in bed and sweat it out. And then... back to pies! Or more accurately pies vs pasties, and then - gulp - pie sandwiches. Pie sandwiches?!</p> <p>Finally the subject turns to games... The Olympic Games, that is. CBPodge takes it upon himself to describe the epic majesty of the opening ceremony: \"they've currently got thousands of Chinese people making a giant moving dove around a piano. Which they've now turned into a model of the stadium...\" Sue Barker, eat your heart out.</p> <p>And somehow, more pies. And quiches. And apparently, gooseberry crumble is mankind's greatest gift to the universe. Finally, at around three o'clock someone mentions a game - Chrono Trigger on DS! No one notices however, as the cockney rhyming slang for tramp crops up. Then, for the love of god, more pies. Soul Calibur IV? Oh go on then, just a few comments mind, then back to pies. Oh, and being sick.</p> <p>Over the weekend, a little on the new PS3 and a smattering of Braid love. Monday detonates with game chat - Drake's Fortune, Morrowwind, Rock Band, Fire Emblem, Mario Galaxy - it's like pies never happened. 10.20am and poor old Silverfox mopes up with tales of a hellish weekend, covered in the pox. How bad was it? \"Haven't even had the energy or desire to turn the 360,\" he complains bitterly. Get well soon!</p> <p>Some football transfer gossip, some game tactics on a game I miss the name of and can't identify from subsequent posts. I enjoy BillyBrush's brief but descriptive Saint's Row 2 preview:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>GTA fans prepare to swap sludgy walking and dodgy lock on for dressing up as a hotdog and taking helicopters down with an unlimited shot missile launcher...bwoohaa!...it's teh post GTA irony fun machine, and i think anyone who takes a punt is going to have a rather large smile on their face...GTA is to be admired, Saints row is to have some fun fun fun, then discarded like a dirrty ho.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>It's just like reading Edge...</p> <p>Tuesday. Daniel Aronofsky's forthcoming Robocop re-make: could go either way. Swash gets extra points for name-checking one of my favourite movies, Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo: The Iron Man (check out the sequel, Body Hammer, and also Tokyo Fist). The talk turns to good and bad re-makes, and Ash1975 asks when re-makes got re-branded as re-boots... I agree with Humofevil - re-boot refers specifically to when a new movie/series, goes back to the roots of the original and re-writes it all, rather than simply modernizing a single film. Anyway, The Fly comes out well, Dawn of the Dead less so, someone mistakingly criticises De Palma's Scarface - a movie that characterizes the Thatcher/Regan eighties like no other.</p> <p>Briggsy brings up PS3 Linux, and the hit-and-miss fun of running MAME emulations on it (\"Newer games like Virtua Fighter are unplayable but it's good for stuff like Puzzle Bobble.\") There's some talk of hard and soft Xbox modding, and a little on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/paolitics/2008/aug/13/conservatives.regeneration\">Policy Exchange's conclusion</a> that Northern cities have 'failed'. Failed at what? Being in the South? ChedderFrenzy's, well, frenzied response is largely unprintable here.</p> <p>Dizzyisanegg asks one of those questions that seems obvious, but actually requires a little thought: why <em>do</em> people play Team Fortress? Loser sums it up best: \"The real genius of the game is the balance, the nine different character classes all feel useful and the team that plays as a team pretty much always wins. The variety of game modes is also impressive\". Olympics chat is confined to Emma Pooley's silver medal and the horrific injury sustained by Hungarian weightlifter Janos Baranyai (footage <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/olympics/index.ssf/2008/08/weightlifter_dislocates_elbow.html\">here</a> - if you're feeling sadistic). Then it's back to the North, specifically Liverpool. Is it screwed? Maybe. Partly. But it's screwed in a beautiful Northern way.</p> <p>Wednesday and it's MGO disappointment ahoy - there's no-one online, since the game's server meltdown troubles (just four hundred people hanging around waiting for non-existent games apparently). As the war in Georgia rumbles on, so does the Chatterbox analysis - ImperfectRex asks the questions no TV reporter dares to:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>Are the Russians and Georgians certain that they're fighting the right people? From what I can see, they are using the same weapons, vehicles and uniforms. And there is little ethnic separation. How could you be sure that you've just directed a mortar round into a Russian advance unit and not your own canteen?</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>Can't see that one coming up on Newsnight.</p> <p>Naturally, there's a lot of talk about the best way to fuel an APC in the event of a zombie apocalypse, which leads onto a general discussion about those military mags we all read as impressionable schoolboys. What next? Ah, Cossacks - where <em>did</em> they come from? And who were they? It's a more complicated subject then you could ever know - or indeed want to know. Less complicated is the Daily Mail's hysterical (in all senses of the word) reaction to Mad World, which I ignore on Gamesblog out of sheer mental exhaustion, but which Elquesodiablo brings into the Wednesday mix. Mediawatch-uk blabbermouth John Beyer is rightfully derided for suggesting that the game should be denied a BBFC certificate because it, \"sounds very unsavoury\".

There is something in the belligerent survival of the sprite-driven beat-'em-up that says, 'you know what MediaWatch? Games will win'. And when America attacks Russia, bringing with it the inevitable zombie apocalypse, the roaring sound that follows will be a thousand Russian APCs filled with Gamesblog readers.

  "<p>Also on the philosophy front, <a href=\"http://dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=992\">here's an insightful essay</a> on Hayek by Jesse Larner from the Winter 2008 issue of Dissent, an American quarterly magazine of the left for which your correspondent has from time to time scribbled.</p> <p>If this is your sort of thing, the whole piece is very much worth a read, but here are two of the salient points:</p> <p>1. Hayek, writers Larner, is \"nowhere near as extreme as his ideological descendants. He admits that there are a few rare economic circumstances in which market forces cannot deliver the optimum result, and that when these occur, the state may legitimately intervene. He recognizes such a thing as the social interest and will even endorse some limited redistributionalism\u2014he goes so far as to suggest that the state ensure a minimum standard of living.\"</p> <p>2. Moving away from Hayek per se, Larner argues that conservatives have often critiqued liberalism, any form of it from the extreme to the mildly meliorative, by arguing that liberalism constantly wants to perfect society and to perfect individuals, turning them into soulless robots of the state. Larner shows that this is a terrible misreading of liberalism on conservatives' part; that liberals believe -- indeed, with conservatives -- \"that human societies are jerry-built structures, rickety towers of ad hoc solutions to unforeseen problems. Their development is evolutionary, and as in biological evolution, they do not have natural end-states.\" What we disagree on is why the problems arise and how to respond to them.</p> <p>You can't tell most conservatives this, in my experience. If I had a dime for every time I heard a conservative say that Hillary Clinton wants to control your mind and make you a captive of the state and indoctrinate your children, I'd be at my beach house right now.</p>",
  "<p>Since the primaries, when Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/08/clinton-obama-not-winning_n_100763.html\">declared</a> that she was more likely to get the votes of \"hard-working Americans, white Americans\", the belief that Obama is unable to win over white, working-class voters has been discussed widely <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/us/politics/24obama.html\">across the media</a>. </p> <p>However, the latest <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/03/AR2008080301969.html?sub=AR\">Washington Post poll</a> suggests a noticeable and surprising turnaround. According to the poll, \"even among white workers - a group of voters that has been targeted by both parties as a key to victory in November - Obama leads McCain by 10 percentage points, 47% to 37%, and has the advantage as the more empathetic candidate.\"</p> <p>I have never really understood why the white working class - defined by the Washington Post research as workers ages 18-64 who work at least 30 hours a week and make $27,000 a year or less, although the definition varies quite dramatically depending on which research you read - would be reluctant to support Obama. Funny name and racial differences aside, he has much more in common with the white working class than McCain does. </p> <p>His background, at least, bears more similarity to a working class one than does McCain's. He was raised by a single mother and his grandparents. His mother, at one point, was on welfare. His attendance at a private school in Hawaii was due to sacrifices made by his family. In <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060858209/Obama/index.aspx\">Obama: From Promise to Power</a>, author David Mendell writes that \"By living in a modest apartment and sending Obama (and eventually [his sister] Maya) to private school, his grandparents had sacrificed their own prosperity for the sake of Obama and his sister.\"</p> <p>Whilst Obama had the fortune to attend prestigious Ivy League institutions such as Columbia and Harvard Universities, he got there not because he comes from a rich family or is well connected, but because he worked hard enough to get in. His wife, Michelle, raised on the poor South Side of Chicago <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1706706,00.html\">describes herself</a> as \"a working class girl\". </p> <p>Of course, not all white, working-class families are run by single mothers or are on welfare. The point is, however, that Obama's story is one of humble beginnings, with hard work being the main factor in getting him to where he is now. </p> <p>Contrast this with John McCain. Born into a family of privilege, McCain's father and grandfather were admirals in the navy. He is married to Cindy, an heiress <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0708/11477.html\">said to be worth some $100m</a>, with whom he apparently has a pre-nuptial agreement. He now apparently owns some <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/12/tour-one-of-john-mccains_n_118449.html\">eight to 10 homes</a> and wears <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/isabel-wilkinson/a-week-in-john-mccains-sh_b_115692.html\">$500 Ferragamo loafers</a>. This doesn't sound like a regular guy who is in touch with working-class life to me. </p> <p>Of course, however, neither McCain nor Obama's backgrounds are that important. It's when looking at what voters should really be basing their decisions on - policies - that it becomes clear that a vote by working-class people against Obama in November would be a vote against their own interests. Going by the Washington Post poll, it seems that the white working class is aware of this.</p> <p>According to the Washington Post research, white, working-class voters are particularly concerned about healthcare, with over 70% saying that the \"government should focus on helping people like them find more affordable health insurance\". On healthcare policies, Obama - who pledges to overhaul the current system, reduce premiums, provide coverage for the 45m uninsured Americans and make affordable health care available to all - is clearly their man. </p> <p>McCain, on the other hand, proposes to encourage people to buy their own health insurance rather than have it provided by their employer, which could lead to the 71% of Americans who have employer-based insurance losing their healthcare coverage. He also advocates a more competitive insurance marketplace as opposed to government intervention and essentially is in favour of a healthcare system that remains the same as it now - that is, one that provides the best coverage for those with the most money.</p> <p>The economy is also a key issue for white, working-class voters. Amongst those who are feeling the most financial strain and who describe themselves as \"very insecure\" in that area, Obama leads by 19 points. </p> <p>On the economy, Obama has proposed raising taxes on high income earners, eliminating corporate tax loopholes, raising the minimum wage and ending the war in Iraq, which is costing the US government $10bn a month. All of these are policies aimed at helping lower-income earners. Anyone who believes that the Republicans would be best for the economy only needs to look at the state of America's economy today.</p> <p>By playing on the idea of Obama as an elitist, McCain - and indeed Hillary Clinton - has used the much debated, and somewhat condescending, notion - espoused by the Thomas Frank book <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What's_the_Matter_with_Kansas\">What's the Matter With Kansas?</a> - that the white working class votes against its own interests on social and moral-based issues because of its dislike for the liberal elite, or that it is simply racist and ignorant.</p> <p>However, it's clear that this view has been overstated. The reality is that on the issues that matter most to white, working-class voters Barack Obama - yes, the man with the funny name - is much more closely aligned with them than McCain. Judging by the polls, they will be casting their votes for him in November.</p>",
  "<p>Ruling in a racially explosive case that some forensic experts have described as police torture, a grand jury in the small Louisiana town of Winnfield indicted a white police officer yesterday on charges of manslaughter and official malfeasance for repeatedly shocking a handcuffed black suspect with a Taser device, resulting in the man's death due to cardiac arrest.</p> <p>After two days of closed testimony, Winn Parish district attorney Chris Nevils announced that the grand jury had indicted Scott Nugent, 21, for the death last January of Baron \"Scooter\" Pikes, 21, while in police custody. Two other Winnfield police officers who were present during the incident were not charged.</p> <p>Nugent, who was fired from the police force in May, could face up to 45 years in prison if convicted on the charges. He surrendered to sheriff's deputies immediately after the indictment was issued, a spokesman for Nevils said, and a $45,000 bond was set.</p> <p>\"It is our intention to show at trial that Mr Nugent caused the death of Baron Pikes by 'Tasing' him multiple times, unnecessarily and in violation of Louisiana law, and by failing to get him medical attention when it was apparent he needed it,\" Nevils said in a statement. \"In a civilised society, abuse by those who are given great authority cannot be tolerated.\"</p> <p>Pikes, wanted on a drug possession warrant, was apprehended and handcuffed January 17 after a foot chase. Although Nugent's police report stated that Pikes did not resist after being handcuffed, the officer administered nine 50,000-volt Taser shocks to Pikes' body after he was slow to respond to Nugent's order to stand up.</p> <p>Winnfield police claimed that Pikes told them during the incident that he suffered from asthma and was high on PCP and crack cocaine. But Winn Parish Coroner Dr Randolph Williams found no evidence of drugs or disease in Pikes' system. He ruled the death a homicide and noted that Pikes was unconscious when the last two Taser shocks were administered.</p> <p>Both Williams and Dr Michael Baden, a nationally prominent forensic pathologist who reviewed the case, said the incident \"could be considered to be torture\".</p> <p>The Pikes case aroused fears of a cover-up among family members and civil rights groups because Winnfield, the birthplace of Louisiana governors Huey and Earl Long, has a long history of political corruption.</p>",
  "<p>Prince Charles's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/prince.charles.gm.farming?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">passionate tirade</a> against GM crops has brought <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a73e8580-69a3-11dd-91bd-0000779fd18c.html\">a predictable response</a> from those with an interest in the technology. Biotech scientists have queued up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">denounce</a> his criticisms as \"ill-informed\". </p> <p>They point out that GM crops are already being grown safely by 12 million farmers around the world. It would be morally indefensible, they claim, to ignore a technology that might provide solutions to the challenges of climate change and farmland degradation.</p> <p>The Prince <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7558585.stm\">is also accused</a> of a indulging in a scatter-gun \"rant\" against urbanisation and globalisation as if everything was the result of GM technology, which clearly it isn't.</p> <p>Still, he must have expected this sort of reaction from the research industry. Over the years, they've been bankrolled to the tune of many billions of pounds from both the taxpayer and agribusiness corporations. Few areas of research have provided so many jobs for scientists.</p> <p>Such is our reverence for cutting-edge science that it's not difficult for the research establishment to mobilise powerful support when it comes under attack. A Times leader the day after the Prince's outburst <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article4526157.ece\">dismissed his utterances</a> on GM crops as \"obscurantism, reaction and superstition\".</p> <p>Despite the clamour, however, he is, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">as John Vidal observes</a>, essentially right. The widespread adoption of GM crops may well threaten the world's food supply. It will probably throw millions of small farmers off the land, and it will almost certainly produce shanty cities of the sort he calls \"unsustainable, unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unimaginable awfulness\". While GM technology may not be the direct cause of such horrors, it will perpetuate the system of industrial agriculture that makes them inevitable.</p> <p>It's a threat acknowledged in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/16/food.biofuels\">a 2008 report</a> from the World Bank and UN agencies. Based on the work of more than 400 scientists, it concludes that the present system of food production \u2013 and the way food is traded \u2013 have led to an unequal distribution of benefits and to serious ecological damage. It was also contributing, the report found, to climate change.</p> <p>The report's authors reject the idea that GM crops have a significant part to play in ending world hunger. What they want to see is more research targeted at protecting soils, water and forests. \"We urgently need sustainable ways to produce food,\" says <a href=\"\">Professor Robert Watson</a>, director of multi-disciplinary group which produced the report. At its launch, a group of eight international environmental and consumer organisations commented: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is a sobering account of the failure of industrial farming. Small-scale farmers using ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the food crisis and meet the needs of communities.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The World Bank report merely confirms what shrewd farmers have always known \u2013 that small, mixed family farms produce more food per hectare than large farms. This applies equally to northern, industrial countries as to the south.</p> <p>In Britain, George Henderson wrote a best-selling book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Farming-Ladder-Third-Impression/dp/B0014BTQTK\">The Farming Ladder</a> setting out how simple it would be to feed the population of these islands by switching to small-scale mixed farming. He proved it on the small farm he and his brother ran in the Cotswolds. During the second world war, it was producing so much food that the government brought farmers from all over Britain to look at it in the hope that they'd go home and do it themselves.</p> <p>Tragically, governments around the world now use public subsidies to swap mixed farming for large-scale, intensive cropping. This system of food production <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/12/biofuels.food\">is inherently unstable</a>. It relies on huge inputs of fossil energy in the form of pesticides, nitrate fertilisers, diesel and machinery. And it steadily degrades the soil, making farmland less and less productive.</p> <p>Large agribusiness companies \u2013 together with their supporters in public science \u2013 are now promoting GM crops as the solution to problems they themselves have created. It's a sticking plaster solution to a wound that urgently needs to be cleaned up. If we really want a safe and sustainable supply of food, we must acknowledge that large-scale grain production has failed and needs to be replaced by small mixed farms. Whether or not GM crops have a role in sustaining this sort of farming <em>is</em> a legitimate question for research.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Prince's own dedication to organic farming makes him a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/feb/27/guardiancolumnists\">less effective advocate</a> of reform than he deserves to be. Dominated as it is by the producer interest, the organic movement has allowed itself to be turned into a lucrative brand. Its contribution to the debate on sustainable agriculture has been blunted by supermarkets, which are happy to see it relegated to niche market status. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Prince Charles is to be applauded for raising these issues: he deserves a pat on the back for speaking up.</p>",
  "<p>Texans - or at least <a href=\"http://www.governor.state.tx.us/about\">governor Rick Perry</a> and his supporters - seem to love the death penalty almost as much as flying the state flag. And last week, the good ol' Texan bloodlust came under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/06/usa\">international scrutiny</a> once again when the state put to death a man born in Mexico, where capital punishment is prohibited.</p> <p>During the trial of death row inmate Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn, he was not given the opportunity to seek legal help from Mexican consulates, a right granted under the 1963 Vienna Convention. Appeals from all over the world - including <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ifumpfom5_ZgZdYRyQFgWoF7ixygD91URU080\">one from the UN's International Court of Justice</a> and another from President Bush himself - pointed out the discrepancy and asked the state to delay the execution till Medell\u00edn's case could be further reviewed. But Perry refused to put on the brakes, and Medell\u00edn <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gpkdpV0pGSS_ozv30DC1F1QkVd5wD92CHCNG5\">died of a lethal injection</a> on August 6.</p> <p>\"Texans are doing just fine governing Texas,\" Perry said last year in response to the European Union's request that he reconsider another death row case involving a young man who had never been accused of directly participating in the murder to which he was linked. Given Perry's audacity, perhaps it's no surprise he has single-handedly <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-01-06-execution_x.htm\">overseen more executions</a> than any other governor in the country since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. He also vetoed a ban on the execution of mentally handicapped inmates in 2002. And since 1976, Texas has carried out more executions than any other state: 409 - more than four times as many as Virginia, its nearest competitor, with 99.</p> <p>At the same time, it's not that difficult to understand why Perry might not have been terribly sympathetic to Medell\u00edn: There seems to be no question that the Mexican took part in the raping and killing of two teenage girls in 1993 as part of a gang initiation rite. But the story of a young man named <a href=\"http://www.savejeffwood.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">Jeff Wood</a>, set to be put to death on August 21, more poignantly highlights the injustices of the Texan judicial system. </p> <p>Despite the fact that the death penalty is supposedly reserved for only the most heinous crimes, Wood is <a href=\"http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/29949/\">sentenced to death</a> for a murder that prosecutors have never accused him of committing - one that took place when he wasn't even in the same building. Rather, he was outside in a gas station parking lot, waiting in a pick-up truck for his buddy, Daniel Reneau, to come out of a road-side store with drinks and snacks. Wood contends that he didn't know Reneau was planning to rob the store - a frequent hang-out spot for the two of them - and that he also had no idea Reneau was going to murder the store clerk, Kris Keeran, a friend of both men.</p> <p>But after hearing a shot ring out on the morning of January 2, 1996, Wood ran inside and saw Keeran laying dead from a single .22-calibre bullet that entered between his eye and his nose. Reneau was holding the gun, which he then turned on Wood, ordering him to grab the store's surveillance video. Wood - who suffers from learning disabilities and mental problems as a result of severe physical abuse during his childhood - complied. Reneau took the store's safe, and the two of them fled to Wood's brother house.</p> <p>Wood and Reneau <em>had</em> talked with the manager of the store about robbing the place on New Year's Day, when the register would be full of money from the night before. But after Wood backed out, he assumed, since he heard no more about it, that the robbery plan was kaput. Instead, Reneau decided to go through with it on his own. Wood contends he had no idea Reneau was even packing a gun at the time of the robbery.</p> <p>Reneau was executed for the murder in 2002. But thanks to the Texas \"<a href=\"http://texasdeathpenalty.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=37&amp;Itemid=59\">Law of Parties</a>\", anyone who conspires with another person or a group to commit one crime (like robbery) and happens to commit another crime in the process (like murder) can be found guilty of the secondary crime - even if the individual in question wasn't directly involved in planning it or carrying it out. And when the secondary crime <em>is</em> murder, that person can also be put to death for it. That's the state's justification for why Wood is on death row - except, of course, that Wood claims he wasn't involved in planning the robbery and that he would never have helped Reneau try to get away with it if Reneau hadn't trained a gun on him. As such, there's been a huge public outcry in support of Wood; the second of two rallies this month to draw attention to his plight will take place on Saturday, August 16.</p> <p>Wood's situation is similar to another recent case in Texas, that of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/us/30execute.html?pagewanted=print\">Kenneth Foster</a> - the one that drew the <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14124188\">attention of the European Union</a>. Like Wood, Foster did not participate in the actual murder he was sentenced to die for. Like Wood, Foster did not hold a gun at any point while the crime he was linked to was committed. Like Wood, Foster has maintained \u2013 convincingly - that he had no foreknowledge the murder was going to happen. Like Wood, Foster was forced to drive the \"get-away\" car. <br> Following demands from around the world that Texas review the Foster case, the Texas board of pardons and paroles recommended that his sentence be commuted - a rare occurrence. Even more unusually, Governor Perry actually took the board's advice and, three hours before Foster's execution was set to happen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/30/usa.haroonsiddique\">stopped it</a>: the first time in nearly seven years in office that he had done so (excluding cases in which Supreme Court rulings had barred the execution of juveniles and the mentally disabled).</p> <p>Will Perry commute the sentence this time, for Wood, like he did for Foster? The cases are so similar that there seems to be hope that he will. Then again, when announcing his decision in the Foster case, Perry didn't mention how problematic the Law of Parties is; instead, he cited a procedural flaw. (Foster was tried simultaneously with the guy convicted of the actual murder; that's what Perry referred to after commuting his sentence.) So who knows. </p> <p>But maybe Perry and the state of Texas should finally start to think about how unconstitutional it is to execute someone based on the Law of Parties. After all, in their 1982 ruling in the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enmund_v._Florida\">Enmund v Florida</a>, the Supreme Court found it was unconstitutional to execute the driver of a get-away car in an armed robbery. The court's rationale was that the eighth amendment forbids imposing capital punishment on someone \"who aids and abets a felony in the course of which a murder is committed by others but who does not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing take place or that lethal force will be employed\". Why can't Texas see that by using the \"Law of Parties\" as a justification for execution, they are not just aiding and abetting but planning and carrying out pre-meditated murders which should not be occurring - and contributing to a cycle of violence and injustice?</p>",
  "<p>Stephen Park, the British sailing team manager, is unequivocal: \"If it is down to Ben Ainslie and Zach Railey or somebody else for the gold medal then Ben will kill them. You could put your house on that. You could put the nation's houses on it.\" The price of properties may be going down, but you know exactly what he means. Ainslie is the supreme dinghy sailor of his generation, having won silver in Atlanta, and then gold at both the Sydney and Athens Olympics. Nothing less than another gold will satisfy him this time. Nothing less is expected.</p> <p>\"Two Portugese, guys I did not know, came up to me the other day and said: 'How did Ben get on?' I told them he had won and they laughed and said: 'Well everybody knows what will happen in the Finn.' Railey has sailed the races of his life but now the pressure is on. Ben is the sailor of our time, the sailor of the moment,\" said Park. Like the rowers Sir Steven Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent in their prime, the thought of Ainslie not winning gold on Saturday would be an aberration.<br> By Wednesday, after the seventh race, he already seemed in complete control and from then on there was an element of the Tour de France leader parading the maillot jaune through Paris on the final day. Ainslie knows it is far from that simple. For these Games the schedule has changed, with a medal race on the final day when points count double. So there remains the possibility that all could go wrong at the last moment, although if that were to happen then watch out for the Great Wall of China crumbling into small pieces as well.</p> <p>\"Ben has an incredible talent for making the right tactical decisions at the right time, and with such huge consistency,\" said Park. \"On the downward stage of one leg this week he moved up from eighth to second, and then another time from seventh to first on the final leg. Most of the other boats stayed in their same positions, but he has the ability to make moves like this, even when there isn't much wind.\" Park likens Ainslie to Michael Schumacher. \"It's sheer talent. Schumacher was at one with his machine while being aware of all that was going on around him. Ben is the same. Even in these conditions he can pick out the little gusts of wind and use them to full advantage. It is incredible.\"</p> <p>Talk to Ainslie and he is charm personified. Sail against him and he is implacably ruthless. Viewed from a distance sailing may appear all rather leisurely and pleasurable, but the tactics and their application can come close to the boxing ring in their intensity. Indeed the British sailor has occasionally been criticised for his piratical tactics, but that would be to misplace his intentions. He knows he is the best, and if anybody challenges him then the fight is joined with no holds barred.</p> <p>\"Ben is not arrogant but I think he expects to win and he is very hard on himself,\" said Park. His concentration is legendary. \"Some have it, some don't,\" Ainslie said, \"and I try never to dwell on the prospect of losing.\" Some things are beyond even his control, as when the wind died on him completely in the opening race and he dropped from first to 10th. \"Eight years ago he would have been putting his fist through the deck,\" said Park. On this occasion Ainslie went out in the second race and left the opposition in his wake.</p> <p>He knows that the opposition are constantly looking to close the gap. So far the six times world champion has answered every challenge, switching from the Laser class after his gold at Sydney to the Finn in Athens and here. Victory will secure his place as one of the great Olympians, and the 31-year-old has no intention of missing out on London 2012. Much of his time after Athens was taken up with the America's Cup, making it all the more remarkable that he was able to switch back to the Finn with, to the angst of his fellow competitors, supreme assurance. He is not only fresher, but stronger too.</p> <p>Unlike many Olympic sailing races there will be huge crowds watching the first two final races when there is a strong possibility that it could be a double golden day with Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb, and Pippa Wilson strongly placed in the Yngling. This class made its Olympic debut in four years ago when Shirley Robertson was at the helm to steer Ayton and Webb, the Three Blondes, to gold. This time Ayton will be holding the tiller.</p> <p>The Chinese already have big plans to turn this city of nine million, most of it built within the last 15 years, into the sailing capital of China. \"The mayor dropped by the other day, and told me of his five-year plan to make this the base for sailing in Asia,\" said Park. \"He told me that he intends to make sure that China dominates Olympic sailing in the future.\" Not for now though. Britain is intending doing that - at least as far as Saturday is concerned.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336584226\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>The United States has warned Russia its military operations in Georgia risk seriously damaging relations between Washington and Moscow for years. Speaking to reporters about the delivery of humanitarian aid to Georgia, Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, said: \"If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the US-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come.\"</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, has also stepped up pressure on Moscow, issuing another urgent call for Russia to honour the ceasefire with Georgia. She met with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, this afternoon to discuss the situation and will travel to Tbilisi tomorrow to have the peace agreement signed by the Georgian president. </p> <p>\"We would hope that he would be true to his word,\" Rice said, of the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev. \"The provisional ceasefire that was agreed to really must go into place. And that means that military activities have to cease.\"</p> <p>There are reports of continued fighting in parts of Georgia. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said humanitarian aid groups and UN monitors were struggling to reach civilians caught up in the conflict because of ongoing fighting and lawlessness. </p> <p>A statement issued by his office said he welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Russia and Georgia \"but notes that notwithstanding this agreement, violence continues, with civilians bearing the brunt.\" </p> <p>He urged all combatants \"to respect and protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights law.\"</p> <p>In Washington, Gates launched a stinging attack on Russia for the scale of force used against Georgia, saying Russia's actions were designed to \"punish\" Georgia for daring to integrate with western organisations, such as Nato, which are outside Russia's influence. </p> <p>\"The Russians were prepared to take advantage of an opportunity and did so very aggressively in a way that went far beyond reasserting the autonomy of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\" he said. <br> He ruled out, however, the use of US military force in Georgia, saying there was \"no prospect\" of American troops being deployed in the region. Military personnel will only be used in a humanitarian capacity to deliver aid to civilians, Gates said. </p> <p>The comments from Gates and Rice came as tensions escalated between the US and Russia on the ground in Georgia. The US has accused Russia of sabotaging airfields and other military infrastructure in Georgia, while Russia has expressed concern about the American airlift to the crisis-torn region.</p> <p>An unnamed US official told the Associated Press there was a deliberate attempt by Moscow to cripple the already battered Georgian military.</p> <p>Reports from the scene indicated Russian forces were trying to disable Georgia's ability to fight again.</p> <p>The allegations came as Russia's general staff said it had concerns about the type of cargoes the US was airlifting to Georgia.</p> <p>Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, the Russian army's deputy chief, told a news conference that Russian \"peacekeepers\" were in the Georgian port of Poti to conduct intelligence operations.</p> <p>The general staff had previously denied its troops were in Poti, a Black Sea port with an oil terminal vital to the country's fragile economy.</p> <p>Nogovitsyn said: \"We have information that American military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport, though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago. Let's ask them will they invite you [the media] to check whether it is humanitarian or not?\"</p> <p>What was really in the cargo, he asked. \"It is of major concern to Russians.\"</p> <p>He said over the previous 24 hours \"we are just watching the situation. There are still snipers out there, certain groups have gotten through, and the provocations are continuing.</p> <p>\"We will settle things with everyone, and right now establishing peace is the main issue.\"</p> <p>Reports today suggested Russian troops continued to move in and around Georgian towns despite a tense ceasefire.</p> <p><br>Washington insisted it had had no problems with the Russians in getting humanitarian and medical aid into Georgia.</p> <p>White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: \"We are not there to defend the ports, we are there to provide humanitarian aid.\"</p> <p>The Georgian government said today that Russia had expanded its military presence in Gori, contradicting earlier claims that it was pulling out of the key town where its presence has threatened the ceasefire.</p> <p>At least five explosions were reportedly heard near Gori and other reports suggested a military supply depot near the town may have been blown up by Russians.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Georgia, a camera crew from Associated Press Television News saw heavily armed Russian soldiers and military vehicles in the western town of Zugdidi, some of whom were wearing blue peacekeeping helmets but others wore green camouflage helmets.</p> <p>In Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, reinforced the Kremlin's determination not to guarantee Georgia's borders.</p> <p>\"One can forget about any talk about Georgia's territorial integrity because, I believe, it is impossible to persuade South Ossetia and Abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the Georgian state.\"</p> <p>His remarks came as the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, was meeting leaders of the two separatist regions.</p> <p>As confusion mounted about how Russia was responding to US calls to pull out its troops to end the week-long conflict, a Russian general said they would soon start to return control of Gori to Georgia.</p> <p>Gori lies south of the disputed South Ossetia region on the main east-west road through Georgia.</p> <p>Russian and Georgian soldiers are reported to have briefly confronted each other at a checkpoint on Gori's outskirts around midday local time, with Russian tanks hurrying to the scene to force the Russian troops to back off.</p> <p>Some Georgian police are reported to have said that a Russian withdrawal broke down after their South Ossetian allies refused to leave.</p> <p>Both sides have signed a ceasefire requiring forces to return to the positions they held before the conflict started last week. But the truce allows Russian forces to take unspecified \"security measures\".</p> <p>The Kremlin could try to keep troops in Georgia while claiming to be protecting South Ossetia. Russian troops moved into the region six days ago after Georgia began a military operation to retake it from separatist control.</p>",
  "<p>The Kremlin today fuelled fears that it was bent on annexing Georgia's two contested provinces when the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, met the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and pledged to support and guarantee any decision they took on their status.</p> <p>Eduard Kokoity, the pro-Russian leader of South Ossetia, on Georgia's northern border with Russia, and Sergei Bagapsh, the leader of the separatist western region of Abkhazia, were called to the Kremlin to sign up to the truce between Russia and Georgia, mediated on Tuesday by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France.</p> <p>Medvedev delivered a robust statement of support for the two rebel regions while Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, flatly dismissed western insistence that Georgia's territorial integrity had to form the basis for any eventual settlement of the conflict. </p> <p>\"We don't want the collapse of Georgia, but the de facto situation is such that neither the South Ossetians nor the Abkhaz want to live in the same state with the person who has sent his troops against them,\" said Lavrov.</p> <p>The Abkhaz administration said it needed to have a \"significant\" Russian \"peacekeeping\" contingent on its soil, indicating that Moscow intended to keep a heavy presence there. </p> <p>President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia said there could be no Russian forces in Abkhazia, although he agreed to a \"temporary\" Russian presence in South Ossetia.</p> <p>The Russians have routed the Georgians, expelled their forces completely from the two regions and European Union officials involved in trying to cement a ceasefire said it was \"realistic\" to expect the Russians to control the breakaway provinces.</p> <p>Medvedev's statement was a green light to the Abkhaz and South Ossetians to organise popular votes in their territories which would return verdicts in favour of independence or absorption by Russia.</p> <p>\"I'd like you to know,\" Medvedev told the two leaders, \"that we support any decision taken by the peoples of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. We will not only support them, but guarantee them in the Caucaus and in the whole world ... Right is on your side.\"<br>Medvedev added that any such decisions should conform with the UN charter and the Helsinki Act. While effectively controlling the two provinces, Russia, said analysts, may prefer to leave its status open and unresolved in order to use them as bargaining tools rather than incorporating them into Russia and provoking a bigger international crisis.</p> <p>The Russian statements put Moscow on a collision course with the west in seeking a diplomatic settlement to the conflict.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is to meet Medvedev in Sochi on the Black Sea tomorrow.</p> <p>Her spokesman said today that \"two points are sacrosanct for Germany. The first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia are not called into question in future talks.\"</p> <p>But Lavrov said that any formula seeking to settle the conflict would be \"useless\" if it mentioned Georgia's territorial integrity.</p> <p>\"Any reference to the territorial integrity of Georgia would simply be seen as an insult, a deeply human insult.\"</p> <p>The tentative peace formula unveiled by EU negotiators on Wednesday made no reference to Georgia's territorial integrity, although a statement issued by EU foreign ministers stressed that any peace pact had to be based on respect for Georgia's recognised borders.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigating the murder of two Chinese graduates in Newcastle upon Tyne have begun looking into a new line of inquiry after it emerged that one of the students may have become embroiled in an internet betting scam.</p> <p>Xi Zhou and her boyfriend, Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, were found dead in their flat in Newcastle on Saturday with severe head wounds from a knife and another sharp weapon. </p> <p>In searching for a motive for the killings police have so far ruled out the possibility that either were involved in organised crime, and described them as \"a hard-working, respectable couple\".</p> <p>However, this afternoon it transpired that Yang, who detectives have not been able to trace to any job since he completed his MA from Newcastle University in September 2006, had placed advertisements on UK-based Mandarin language website to recruit people to watch football matches around the world.</p> <p>In one he wrote: \"It is a very simple job, any student who is interested, please contact Zhenxing Yang\" before listing an email address. </p> <p>A similar posting under the name CICI-UK, his girlfriend's nickname, which appeared on the powerappple website last October, said: \"Work: watch football games and send live information to people. </p> <p>\"Requirement: Basic understanding of football rules, no professional background needed, advantage if you have a car. </p> <p>\"Location: Sheffield, London, Blackpool, Portsmouth, York, Hull and many other places.\" </p> <p>In December, Yang advertised for people in South America to do the same. </p> <p>On January 5 2007 he posted on a Mandarin-language site: \"Anyone want a 50/hr job? </p> <p>\"UK-based football 'information' company looking for live information from the Mexican League.\" </p> <p>After the murders, internet posters on the site made a series of allegations about the couple. </p> <p>One theory posted online suggested that because football matches shown on TV in China were a minute behind the live action in the stadium, gambling syndicates were placing employees at games to gain an advantage. </p> <p>A Northumbria police spokesman said: \"We continue to look into the lifestyle of both victims and internet websites form part of this investigation. </p> <p>\"We cannot comment further at this stage.\"</p> <p>Internet rumours suggested Yang was an agent, and that some of the employees were in dispute about missing payments. </p> <p>A Mandarin-speaker said today: \"Things did not go smoothly, according to the forum, and people were not paid on time. </p> <p>\"Complaints were raised and some people felt they were cheated.\"</p> <p>Earlier today they said it was likely that whoever was responsible for the murders had also drowned the couple's pet cat after a postmortem examination revealed the couple's pet had been drowned in the bowl of water under the sink in the bathroom.</p> <p>The officer leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, said: \"Given the recent nature of the cat's death and where it was found, it is reasonable to assume that those responsible for the two murders also killed the cat.\"</p> <p>Police have looked into whether killing a pet had any cultural significance in Chinese culture and whether cats were thought to be lucky.</p> <p>Wade said police were investigating a possible link between the murders and an individual arrested yesterday morning in the Shieldfield area of the city on suspicion of aggravated burglary.</p>",
  "<p>The US primary season played out about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/19/itsafastforwardcampaigna\">the way I expected it to</a>, and the general election season hasn't yet begun in a substantive sense. We're at that point in the presidential campaign in which the presumptive nominees are without presumptive voters. Most voters don't want to think or do much about it until after their summer vacations, the Olympics, the party conventions and Labour day, unless it's to tell pollsters they intend to vote for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barr\">Bob Barr</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nader\">Ralph Nader</a>, are undecided, will sit home, or some other 'truth' which will likely change by November 4. As any <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain\">naval aviator</a> would recognize, the wannabe ships of state are currently becalmed in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doldrums\">Doldrums</a>. No <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_of_Change\">wind</a> for clear sailing, but plenty of hot air.</p> <p>That's not to say the Doldrums are unremittingly boring. They get heavy squalls, thunderstorms and even hurricanes, as in certain political operatives trying to prove they're worth the big bucks, they can turn a sinking campaign around, they can affect poll numbers, they can even snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p> <p>May I <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Consideration\">present for your consideration</a> the recent McCain TV ads and talking points. They appear to be done by committee, a scattergun approach of throwing everything and hoping something sticks, the random responses of a desperate campaign team. Appearances can be deceptive. Check the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove\">Karl Rove</a> playbook (the one he thoughtfully left behind before his current kerfuffle with the Senate's contempt citation) after reminding yourself of Rove's first rule: All's fair in love, war and politics.</p> <p>The way I read the Book of Rove, elections are won by energising your base and reaching the undecideds. (Those who have definitely made up their minds, particularly those enthusiastic about their candidate, are unlikely to change their minds and can be ignored.) Who's your base? Not just those who support your candidate, but also those unlikely to support your opponent. There's a difference. For those not comfortable supporting your candidate, convince them of the importance of voting against your opponent. If the voter doesn't believe there's much difference between them, he's likely to stay home. Hence the need to exaggerate any real or imagined differences until the voter reaches his tipping point. He's already unhappy, so your job is to make him even unhappier. Or angrier, or more fearful, or whatever it takes to push him over the edge.</p> <p>Who are the undecided voters? Generally speaking, those who haven't been paying attention to politics and government (through disinterest and/or boredom), but don't want to admit it because \"knowledgeable about serious matters\" is part of their self-image. Convince them you can be trusted, and they'll buy just about anything you're selling. How do you gain their trust? Same way everyone else does. First flatter them by agreeing with whatever they already believe. Create a bond by pointing out not everyone recognises these truths, only those with intelligence and common sense (call those of other viewpoints \"sheeple\" or \"liberals\" or some other derogatory term. Now share some new information which is then corroborated by (supposedly) multiple reliable, independent sources. Works a treat.</p> <p>From what I've seen, if people are given the same information from at least three (apparently) reliable and unrelated sources, and the information sounds at all plausible, they tend to accept it as true or likely true. And once they've accepted it, they're reluctant to change their minds even after learning the true facts (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\">cognitive dissonance</a> being the term for this). First impressions do count, so get your story out there, and get it out there first. Can't get corroboration because what you're saying is, not to put too fine a point on it, not quite the gospel truth? Or even close? No problem - think <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Chalabi\">Ahmed Chalabi</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball_%28informant%29\">Curveball</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Miller_%28journalist%29\">Judith Miller</a>. Fake it.</p> <p>So how is this being played out in this particular campaign? Check Snopes on <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/obama.asp\">popular anti-Obama emails</a> which have been spread from one friend to another. Now match their messages up with the various <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/tvads/\">McCain ads</a>. Yes, I mean you, dear reader. That's what Cif is for. Connect the dots and share with others.</p> <p>The basis of the technique is simple. The public, through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network\">social networking</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds\">The wisdom of crowds theory</a>, has already done the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development\">R&amp;D</a> for which messages work best in the sense of being both popular and appealing (for whatever reason). The target audience is primed, as they've earlier received multiple copies of each email from various people and groups they're connected with in different circles. Now it's just a matter of reminding them of it, and reinforcing it yet again - this time from a semi-official source even though all the lies, rumours and innuendos aren't being repeated. They don't have to be repeated. The target audience will hear them just the same. It's the reverse of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Matthews\">Chris Matthews</a> line, \"Tell me something I don't know.\" Tell them something they do know (its truth value being irrelevant), but may have forgotten or filed in the back of their memory bank. Don't be specific, just hit a hot button or two with the TV ad or video. Then let all those neurons make their connections. It's the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov\">Pavlovian response</a>, something Karl Rove loves to watch in action. Others may rightly call it a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick\">con game</a> or even an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_%28film%29\">illusion</a> in the sense of the pledge, the turn and the prestige. </p> <p>The genius (so to speak) is in figuring out not just the reaction to the action, but the reaction to the reaction.</p> <p>The skill is in the set-up, the laying of the groundwork, the training or \"grooming\" of the mark. Erm, voter. You need a few <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill\">shills</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot\">useful idiots</a>, but talk radio is filled with those ready, willing and able. Certain <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnist\">columnists</a> (more like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation\">calumnists</a>), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit_%28expert%29\">pundits</a> and TV preachers are also happy to help. The pay-off is biggest when the final act looks unpremeditated and even a bit clumsy, certainly not obvious or slick. It has to be believable, a \"just folks\" moment. And the clumsier it is, the more likely it is to go viral: \"Just look at those incompetent oafs running his campaign.\" Dumb like a fox, as in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel\">Fox News</a>, brought to you by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ailes\">Roger Ailes</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a>.</p> <p>Not that the tactics are limited to the contents of emails. We saw this earlier with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insight_(magazine)\">Insight magazine</a> and their madrassa story being repeated by Fox News and various emails. Even now, a sizable number of people think there's at least a kernel of truth in it. After Obama's response to McCain's celebrity ad, describing Team McCain's general focus of painting him as \"The Other\", <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Davis_%28lobbyist%29\">Rick Davis</a> accused Obama of \"playing the race card from the bottom of the deck\". Why? To remind voters of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case\">OJ Simpson trial</a> in which the verdict was received very differently in black and in white communities. The point? Reinforcing the \"he's not one of us\" meme. A bank shot rather than a dunk shot, but it scored just the same. Or in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Brush\">Basil Brush</a> terms, boom-boom!</p> <p>One not-to-be-missed beauty of this strategy is that the recognizable faces are given plenty of deniability while still fully communicating their desired points. The anonymous emails are where the lies, rumours and innuendo reside, while the official campaign and its surrogates simply remind voters of the topic. We didn't say that! We didn't mean that!

  "<p>Two women have been charged in connection with the murders of British honeymooners in Antigua.</p> <p>Ben Mullany and his wife Catherine, both 31, from Pontardawe, south Wales, were shot in the head during an apparent bungled burglary on the last day of their honeymoon in their cottage at the Cocos Hotel and Resort on the Caribbean island.</p> <p>It is understood the charges relate to goods stolen from the couple. </p> <p>Inspector Cornelius Charles said: \"The investigation into the double murders of Benjamin and Catherine Mullany has been ongoing. </p> <p>\"This morning two females appeared before the chief magistrates at St John's magistrates court, having been arrested and charged with offences connected to the murders. </p> <p>\"At this stage we are not in a position to disclose any further information as the inquiry continues.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a> today unveiled plans for a global alliance with American Airlines that will allow cooperation on fares and schedules - prompting warnings from rivals that passengers will be hit by higher ticket prices as a result.</p> <p>BA chief executive Willie Walsh said the agreement, which must be cleared by competition authorities in the US and EU, would offer consumers more destinations and a wider choice of fares. </p> <p>The partnership will cover 493 destinations in 121 different countries and will, according to BA, give British customers more reliable and cheaper journeys to US destinations. However, Virgin Atlantic warned that it would give BA and AA control over nearly two-thirds of one of the most lucrative markets in aviation: Heathrow Airport to New York's JFK.</p> <p>\"There is no reason why fares should go up as a result of this. For the consumer it means they will have access to a much bigger network. We will coordinate our schedules to make it easier to connect between airlines and you will have greater access to cheaper fares,\" said Walsh. </p> <p>The BA boss added that passengers on transatlantic routes will be able to choose between BA and AA fares when they book flights - allowing them to choose the cheapest fare on both legs of a return journey. \"There will be nothing to stop the customer from taking a fare with AA outbound and taking a fare with BA on the inbound leg.\"</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic, BA's closest rival in the UK to US market, laid down a marker as the most vehement opponent of the agreement, which faces months of scrutiny from competition watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic. Paul Charles, the airline's director of communications, said: \"It is anti-competitive. It will force up fares and it will mean that passengers get a worse service, because if you get rid of competitors by combining BA with AA you have got no one snapping at your heels to make you improve your product.\"</p> <p>Walsh hit back with arguments that will be heard by Department of Transport officials in Washington over the next few months, saying that the recent liberalisation of the transatlantic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">airline market </a>by the Open Skies treaty had created an open market in Heathrow-to-US flights. </p> <p>The treaty scrapped provisions that limited the Heathrow-to-JFK route to four airlines when it was introduced in March this year. Walsh said Open Skies was the biggest difference between now and seven years ago, when BA's application for an alliance with AA foundered on regulatory fears over access to Heathrow. \"This is an open market and that is the big difference between now and 2001. Anybody can come in and compete.\"</p> <p>Walsh ruled out selling Heathrow slots as a makeweight in any regulatory probe - a precondition that led to BA abandoning the previous attempt at an AA alliance. Spain's Iberia, Finnair and Royal Jordanian are also applying for anti-trust immunity as part of the alliance, but the probe by competition watchdogs is expected to focus on the transatlantic market.</p>",
  "<p>There is never a dull moment in Pakistan. As the country moved from a moth-eaten dictatorship to a moth-eaten <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/08/asia/AS-GEN-Pakistan.php\">democracy</a> the celebrations were muted. Many citizens wondered whether the change represented a forward movement.</p> <p>Five months later, the moral climate has deteriorated still further. All the ideals embraced by the hopeful youth and the poor of the country \u2013 political morality, legality, civic virtue, food subsidies, freedom and equality of opportunity \u2013 once again lie at their feet, broken and scattered. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Ali_Zardari\">widower Bhutto</a> and his men are extremely unpopular. The worm-eaten tongues of chameleon politicians and resurrected civil servants are on daily display. Removing Musharraf, who is even more unpopular, might win the politicians badly-needed popular support, but not for long.</p> <p>As the country celebrated its <a href=\"http://voanews.com/english/2008-08-14-voa7.cfm\">61st birthday</a> today, its official president, ex-General Pervez Musharraf, was not allowed to take the salute at the official parade marking the event, while state television discussed plans to impeach him. Within a few days at most, Musharraf will resign and leave the country. Pakistan's venal politicians decided to move against him after the army chief, Ashfaq Kayani, let it be known that there would be no military action to defend his former boss.</p> <p>Washington followed suit. In Kayani they have a professional and loyal military leader, who they imagine will do their bidding. Earlier John Negroponte had wanted to retain Musharraf as long as Bush was in office, but they decided to let him go. Anne Patterson, the US ambassador, and a few British diplomats working under her, tried to negotiate a deal on behalf of Musharraf, but the politicians were no longer prepared to play ball. They insisted that he must leave the country. Sanctuaries in Manhattan, Texas and the Turkish island of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCy%C3%BCkada\">B\u00fcy\u00fckada</a> are being actively considered. The general would prefer a large estate in Pakistan, preferably near a golf course, but security considerations alone would make that unfeasible. There were three attempts on his life when he was in power and protecting him after he goes would require an expensive security presence. Had Musharraf departed peacefully when his constitutional term expired in November 2007 he would have won some respect. Instead he imposed a state of emergency and sacked the chief justice of the supreme court who was hearing a petition challenging Musharraf's position.</p> <p>Now he is going in disgrace, abandoned by most of his cronies who accumulated land and money during his term and are now moving towards the new powerbrokers. Amidst the hullabaloo there was one hugely diverting moment involving pots and kettles. Two days ago, Asif Zardari, the caretaker-leader of the People's party who runs the government and is the second richest man in the country (from funds he accrued when his late wife was prime minister) <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C08%5C11%5Cstory_11-8-2008_pg1_1\">accused</a> Musharraf of corruption and siphoning US funds to private bank accounts.</p> <p>Musharraf's departure will highlight the problems that confront the country, which is in the grip of a food and power crisis that is creating severe problems in every city. Inflation is out of control. The price of gas (used for cooking in many homes) has risen by 30%. Wheat, the staple diet of most people, has seen a 20% price hike since November 2007 and while the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation admits that the world's food stocks are at record lows there is an additional problem in Pakistan.</p> <p>Too much wheat is being smuggled into Afghanistan to serve the needs of the Nato armies. The poor are the worst hit, but middle-class families are also affected and according to a June 2008 survey, 86% of Pakistanis find it increasingly difficult to afford flour on a daily basis, for which they blame their own new government.</p> <p>Other problems persist. The politicians remain divided on the restoration of the judges sacked by Musharraf. The chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, is the most respected person in the country. Zardari is reluctant to see him back at the head of the supreme court. A possible compromise might be to offer him the presidency. It would certainly unite the country for a short time. And there is the army. Last month, the country's powerless prime minister, Yousuf Gilani, went on a <a href=\"http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/27/stories/2008072751961200.htm\">state visit</a> to the US. On July 29 he was <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/publication/16877/pakistans_prime_minister.html?breadcrumb=%2F\">questioned</a> by Richard Haass, president of Council on Foreign Relations: </p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Haass:</strong> Let me ask the question a different way, then \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 beyond President Musharraf, which is whether you think now in the army there is a broader acceptance of a more limited role for the army. Do you think now the coming generation of army officers accepts the notion that their proper role is in the barracks rather than in politics?</p> <p><strong>Gilani:</strong> Certainly, yes. Because of the February 18 election of this year, we have a mandate to the moderate forces, to the democratic forces in Pakistan. And the moderate forces and the democratic forces, they have formed the government. And therefore the people have voted against dictatorship and for democracy, and therefore, in future even the present of \u2013 the chief of the army staff is highly professional and is fully supporting the democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is pure gibberish and convinces nobody. Over the last 50 years the US has worked mainly with the Pakistan army. This has been its preferred instrument. Nothing has changed. The question being asked now is how long it will be before the military is back at the helm.</p> <p><em>Tariq Ali's latest book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Duel-Pakistan-Flight-American-Power/dp/1847373550/\">The Duel: Pakistan on the Flight Path of American Power</a> will be published in September by Simon and Schuster</em></p>",

  "<p><br> Woody Allen and bronze-y Allen in Oviedo</p> <p>The cast of Woody Allen's upcoming film Vicky Cristina Barcelona were surprised to come across a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Estatua_Woody_Allen_en_Oviedo.jpg\">life-size statute of the director</a> while roaming the streets of the Spanish city of Oviedo after a day's shooting. Penelope Cruz said that that upon the discovery, she, along with co-stars Javier Bardem and Scarlett Johansson, \"took pictures with the sculpture, hugging it, and gave the photos to Woody\".</p> <p>Allen himself played down the honour, calling it \"one of the great mysteries of western civilisation\" and ruminating whether Oviedo simply puts a statue up of whichever movie star happens to be in town. \"Oviedo is a lovely town in Spain,\" he said. \"I went there a couple of times, and, without asking me, they erected this statue. I never saved someone from drowning and they put a statue up of me in the town. I thought it was a joke.\"</p> <p>The idea that a minor Spanish city might decide to erect a statue of a bespectacled American auteur out of the blue, without notification, is an appealingly wacky one (though the end result is nowhere near qualifying as one of <a href=\"http://www.oddee.com/item_89236.aspx\">the most bizarre statues in the world</a>). However, Allen's surprise may not be entirely genuine, as the statue was in fact erected in 2002 to mark him winning one of the annual <a href=\"http://www.fundacionprincipedeasturias.org/ing/index.html\">Prince of Asturias Awards</a>.</p> <p>The good news is that Allen approves: \"It's a good statue of me; I've got my sports jacket on and corduroy trousers\".

  "<p>It was 73 years ago today that Franklin Roosevelt signed into law the bill creating <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)\">Social Security</a>, the American public pension system for senior citizens. On the day FDR signed the bill, nearly half of elderly Americans lived in poverty. There was simply no provision at all for many people. Their only recourse was to rely on their children. Every year since, Social Security has paid for itself and saved millions of elderly people from destitution. It was the first such large-scale program in the world. We (Yanks) beat you (Brits) by 11 years if I'm not mistaken.</p> <p>It was opposed by an assortment of right-wing cranks who issued the usual warnings about socialism, although the <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/history/tally.html\">vote tally</a> against it (33 in the House, six in the Senate) turned out to be small. </p> <p>The opposition shriveled even further as the program's obvious success and popularity became irrefutable. <a href=\"http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_eisenhower_quote.htm\">Here</a> was Dwight Eisenhower, in 1954:</p> <blockquote> <p>Should any political party attempt to abolish social security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.

Their number is negligible and they are stupid.</p> </blockquote> <p>They're still stupid, but alas their number is no longer negligible. They run the country. If John McCain wins, they will still run the country, by and large. Do you think McCain changed his position on offshore drilling because of gas prices? Think again. He changed to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/26/AR2008072601891.html\">rake in oil money</a>. </p> <p>And McCain thinks Social Security's financing system is a \"disgrace.\" The disgrace would be giving these people another chance to dismantle history's most successful government program.</p>",
  "<p>America is at war. Make no mistake about it. I check the internet daily for the latest updates. Yahoo in the US has provided a nice little <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/beijing/medals\">counter</a> where I can keep track of the wins and losses. NBC pours out television coverage without end. Every moment of glory, every nadir of defeat is shown live. Like most Americans, I can't get enough. Will we win the war? Will we remain a superpower or are our days numbered? Will the Beijing Olympics be our undoing?</p> <p>Sure, the Russians might <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia6\">still be invading Georgia</a> and the amorphous war on terror is eating up millions of dollars an hour in Iraq and Afghanistan, but for America the real focus is on Beijing. Even George W Bush is there, while the world slowly goes to hell in a handbasket. This is a contest where we know who the opposition is. We know what the goals are. We can define winning and losing. We know that if we don't bring home more medals \u2013 especially those all-important gold medals \u2013 that another nail will be driven into the coffin of American decline. America needs a win for its psychological well-being and it can't afford a loss.</p> <p>For some time now it has been extremely popular to talk of America's fall from grace. The American Century is over, China is on the rise. Given that the US is bogged down in two conflicts, the economy in stagnation and the only place the dollar still has value is in Disney World, the pundits have suitable grounds for their arguments. Perhaps they ignore the assumptions upon which the economic rise of China is predicated: uninterrupted growth at the current rate for the next few decades; continued peace and stability across the country; a compliant population. But these issues do not matter. </p> <p>The zeitgeist is with China, not America. The world believes America is on its way out and China is taking over the driver's seat. The Olympics may be the one place where the US can show it still is the most powerful country on earth. The raw power of youth and talent is a telling indicator of the future, is it not? It is with good reason that politicians and publics alike in the US are enraptured with the games. Great power politics were more the once played out through the games in the 20th century. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics\">1936 Olympics</a> in Nazi Germany was the first case where politics and sport clashed. The Olympics provided a brilliant platform for Hitler to introduce the good side of Nazi Germany to the world. The Nazis put on their happy face, showed off the wonder of National Socialism and even laid off the persecution of the Jews to garner a big propaganda victory for the Reich. Hitler believed that the Aryan athletes of the Third Reich would crush the opposition. Despite the fact that the black American Jesse Owens won four gold medals, Hitler's Germany took home a whopping 89 medals, 33 of them gold. The US came second with 56 overall, 24 of them gold. </p> <p>The great game continued in the 1980s with the US and Soviet Union exchanging the arms race for the race to the medals podium. Politics won out over the games, resulting in a US boycott of the 1980 Moscow games and a Soviet boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles games. The politicians did not suffer, but the athletes did. One can only imagine what Washington thought as the Soviet Evil Empire took home 195 medals in 1980, with East Germany coming second with 126. The mood was one of national despair following the 1973 oil boycott that precipitated an American economic crisis, as well as the embarrassing hostage crisis in Tehran. America was in a crisis of confidence much as it is today.</p> <p>In 1984 when the USSR and the eastern bloc boycotted the games, the US came back with 174 medals and 83 first-place finishes. Not long after, the increasing pace of the arms race and globalisation saw off the Soviet Union. So perhaps there is little reason to fret about these Olympics. Even if America does not win the most medals, it really doesn't mean that the American era is at an end does it really? Surely, Washington has better things to worry about than amateur athletes giving it their all? </p> <p>Oh, gotta go. The rowing is on and in a matter of four years the Chinese have managed to field some amazing boats that will challenge traditionally dominant rowing powers such as the US, UK and Germany \u2013 definitely don't want to miss this. Maybe there is more to this than meets the eye.</p>",

Media regulator Ofcom, which received a number of complaints following the programme, is yet to rule on the incident. </p> <p>The TalkSport programme director, Moz Dee, said at the Radio Festival in Glasgow in July that the decision to let Whale go was a \"very painful one, and made with regret\".</p> <p>Former TalkSport boss Kelvin MacKenzie branded Whale's sacking as \"ridiculous\" and \"cowardly\" in his Sun column in May.</p> <p>Whale did not rule out a return to the station in the future. \"I have said I would come back if we could come to some agreement,\" he said. \"They haven't really filled the position.\"</p> <p>A TalkSport spokesman declined to comment.</p> <p>Whale will be back on the airwaves next week as a guest host on London talk station LBC 97.3.

  "<p>The mainstream Chinese media are on a tight leash during the Olympics. They have been instructed to focus on positive stories, not to adopt too nationalist a tone and to treat all official proclamations with deep respect. But Chinese internet sites are buzzing with irreverence and self-deprecating humour. On bulletin boards, in chat-rooms and on mobile phone messages, the butt of most jokes is the dismal Chinese football team, who crashed out at the group stage after drawing 1-1 with New Zealand, losing 0-2 to Belgium and being trounced 0-3 by Brazil. </p> <p>But there is also a humorous pride in the nation's biggest sporting hero, the hurdling champion Liu Xiang, and a witty take on the politics of sport in an imaginary dialogue between Hu Jintao and George Bush. Perhaps most impressive is the horror story that follows the mock announcement that China might have to go through all this again. </p> <p>A refreshing break from Xinhua and the China Daily, which have columns today with the headlines: \"Highs and sighs of a dream,\" and \"Keeping the torch of hope alive\".</p> <p><strong>On football woes:</strong></p> <p>Alas for Chinese football! Our players are like eunuchs in a brothel: no one can shoot.</p> <p>The other night, I was alone at home so I shut the door, drew the curtains and started watching the Chinese football team on CCTV5. Five minutes later, I was startled to hear a key in the lock so I quickly turned the TV off. My friend came in and saw me looking very embarrassed. \"Have you been watching pornography?\" he said. \"Oh no, of course not, never,\" I replied. But he was still suspicious so he turned on the TV and saw the match. \"Oh my god! You were watching the Chinese team,\" he said. My face went bright red. \"No, no, I was watching porn.\"</p> <p>Advertisement for a television show: There has been a sudden outbreak of disease near a Beijing river, all life in the water has perished and the plants along the banks are withering. Is this because of a deadly new pesticide? Is it a chemical attack? Please tune in and watch tonight's special documentary: \"Chinese footballers wash their feet in the river.\"</p> <p>Brazil are playing China in the football. Just before kick-off, Alex Pato, the Brazilian superstar, is so confident that he says to his team: \"I can handle this match by myself.\" So the rest of the team go to the pub for a drink. Sure enough, five minutes into the game, Pato scores. The team, watching from the bar are delighted and expected a flood of other goals. But after 90 minutes, the game ends 1-0. Pato joins up with his team-mates, looking dejected. \"Cheer up,\" they say, \"You were all alone against 11 Chinese players, yet you still won. You did a great job.\"</p> <p>Pato refuses to be comforted. \"You haven't heard the whole story. After I scored that first goal, I fouled a Chinese player and got sent off.\"</p> <p><strong>On having to go through it all again:</strong></p> <p>News flash on the International Olympic Committee website: Jacques Rogge is so impressed by China's great work that Beijing will also host the next Olympics in 2012. When word gets out, throngs of government officials, police, para-militaries and community workers faint to the ground. There is no one to help them because all the hospital staff are in shock. From the CCTV office to the stock market, the cry is the same: \"Fuck You Rogge!\"</p> <p><strong>On Olympic environmental and traffic regulations:</strong></p> <p>Pigsy took his horse for a walk one morning and came back without it. His master, monk Tong, asked him what happened. \"It was taken away by the police because it farted loudly,\" answered Pigsy. Surprised, the monk asked why a fart was cause for a detention. Pig replied sadly, \"The police were enforcing environmental protection standards controls for the Olympics. The horse's exhuast was over the limit and far too noisy. It also violated the odd-even traffic controls. Today was an even day, but our horse only has one tail.\"</p> <p><strong>On sporting politics (and that football team again):</strong></p> <p>The Presidents of the US and China, George Bush and Hu Jintao, are trying to outdo one another with tales of their countries' Olympic strengths:<br>Bush: Let's go and watch the basketball tonight!<br>Hu: Oh sorry, I will be busy tonight. How about we go together to see table tennis another day?<br>Bush: Do you have time for tomorrow's swimming events?<br>Hu: But I have already decided to see the diving! That's ballet in air.<br>Bush: Let's go and see the football!<br>Hu: Erm, OK, perhaps the basketball is not so bad after all.<br><strong><br>On superstars and eugenic breeding</strong></p> <p>The 110m men's hurdles champion Liu Xiang and the legendary runner Wang Junxia are asked to marry so that the world can see how fast a baby they can produce. Ten months months later, the baby is due and Liu Xiang waits anxiously outside the delivery room. After a while the nurse comes out and Liu asks \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" The nurse replies nervously, \"We didn't have time to check. It ran away right after it was born.\"</p>",
  "<p>Students faced the toughest ever scramble for university places today as record numbers achieved straight As and the pass rate rose to 97% for the first time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of students already at university were being paid to answer calls from applicants who had missed their grades and hoped to get on a course, and from others who could not believe their luck and were phoning to check they really did have a place. </p> <p>At Kingston University 64 students were manning the phones - almost double the number drafted in to do the job last year.</p> <p>They were expecting to take 20,000 calls today and tomorrow - 1,000 every hour. By 11.30am today, students had taken nearly 2,300 calls. </p> <p>\"I've got a caller for pharmacology. Would you like his Ucas number?\" Verere Oyearone, 18, a second year pharmaceutical sciences student at Kingston, asks an admissions tutor on the other line. This is Oyearone's seventh call in the last hour.</p> <p><br>Some 800 places out of a total of 6,000 are up for grabs through Clearing at Kingston this year - a similar figure to last year, professor Martyn Jones, Kingston's pro-vice-chancellor for external relations says.</p> <p>This year the calibre of applicants is higher than ever. The proportion of A-levels awarded an A is expected to rise above the 25.3% it was last year. In 1990 it was 12%.</p> <p>\"There have been lots of Bs, Cs and Ds. No Es so far,\" says Oyearone. </p> <p>In fact, at the Kingston Clearing centre, those taking the calls are noticing that many students have achieved better grades than they expected and are trying to break the contract with what was their top choice university and go elsewhere.</p> <p>That can put universities in a difficult situation, not knowing how many places they have spare.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are ringing to change their courses because their results are better,\" says Nick Bhugeloo, operations manager of applicant services at Kingston. \"That's happening more this year than last. We want to do the right thing by them and try to help. It might mean they are now qualified to apply for a three-year degree, rather than the foundation degree they originally applied for.\"</p> <p>Jones says about 10% of students seem to be doing better than they expected. \"If you think that the process of applying to university started before Christmas, you can see that a lot can happen in that time. We have to be realistic about students who break their contracts with what was their top choice university. No university wants a student who wants to be somewhere else.\"</p> <p>But there are still students disappointed to have missed their grades. An estimated 50,000 out of the 300,000 who received their grades across the country today will go into Clearing.</p> <p>\"Don't worry, it'll all be fine,\" says Shiri Rajput, 20, a second-year law student, to one distraught caller. This is Rajput's 15th call since the hotline opened at 8.30am.</p> <p>\"There was one who was so upset she couldn't speak,\" says Oyearone. \"I try to calm them down and to tell them that everything is going to be fine. This is not the end of the world.\"</p> <p>\"Their voices can go very quiet if they are very panicky,\" says Rajput. </p> <p>This morning, Kingston had places on computing, science and business degrees available through Clearing.</p> <p>Arts, drama and history places were the most sought-after.*</p> <p>\"We are seeing many more well-informed applicants this year,\" says Jones. \"They ask more about the career paths that the degrees will lead to and the 'soft skills' they'll gain than they did years ago. We have very thoughtful discussions with many of them.\"</p> <p>It's a long 10-hour shift for Rajput and Oyearone. \"But it's nice to have helped someone find a place when they start off upset,\" says Rajput.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 22 2008 to remove a reference to places on fashion courses going quickly in clearing.</p>",
  "<p>Let's face it the annual <a href=\"http://www.pesfan.com/\">PES</a> vs <a href=\"http://www.fifa09.ea.com/\">FIFA</a> battle is even more predictable and dull than the Premiership. Everyone knows that FIFA will be polished and sexy but ultimately come second to the on pitch beauty of PES. But could this year finally see the tide turning in FIFA's favour?</p> <p>I'm a card carrying member of the PES Appreciation Society but last year was the first time I seriously considered switching to FIFA. PES 2008 was *still* more fun to play - the trademark delay between button press and on-screen action was still present in FIFA '08 and players generally never felt 100% under control - but the laggy and basic online modes were a a real problem for Konami's game. FIFA '08 may have lacked on the pitch but the online options (leagues, 5vs5) and the play-as-one-player-on-a-team Be a Pro mode meant I spent more time on a FIFA game than I had for years. In fact, for the first time since <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3jVh_IJwO0\">Matt Le Tissier</a> was the world's greatest footballer I'm officially excited about the next FIFA game. Konami, perhaps realising that the tide is turning, have apparently \"pulled out all the stops\" for PES 2009. Let's hope that translates to \"fixing the godawful online play\". Anyway, from today's press release:</p> <p>\"We have pulled out all the stops to make PES 2009 a landmark in footballing games,\" commented Jon Murphy, PES Project Leader for Konami Digital Entertainment GmbH. \"From the most basic controls, through to the wide-ranging additions to game modes such as \"Become a Legend\", all-new visuals, sound, and the Edit mode, Seabass and his team have strived to cram as much as they can into the new game. And with more online announcements to follow, there is every reason to believe that PES 2009 is the football game everyone has been waiting for.\"</p> <p>Let's hope so. Any other PES diehards feeling the pull of FIFA 09?</p>",

  "<p>Six podium finishes apiece this season. That's what Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa have in common. Just eight points separate the three - in that order - at the top of the drivers' championship standings. Sounds like they're evenly-matched, punching at the same weight and getting tricky to separate doesn't it? Well, not quite. The other thing all three share is that they seem incapable of consistently producing the goods.</p> <p>Thanks to Michael Schumacher and, it has to be said, Fernando Alonso, we've become used to consistent (almost predictable) champions. Drivers whose talent only wavers on very few occasions on the way to their crowns; for whom a disastrous weekend might befall them, but is not repeated. Yet this year we are watching Hamilton, Raikkonen and Massa seemingly unable to string together a steady crop of results - and that means that none have been able to make a clear break in the title race. In fact, hovering behind them and gobbling up the crumbs is Robert Kubica - just five points adrift of Massa.</p> <p>In the past 11 races, only twice have we seen all three main contenders stand on the podium together. Firstly in Spain, back in April, where Raikkonen won. Then the following race in Turkey, where Massa took the flag. This has allowed nine other drivers to finish in the top three at least once. In Canada, indeed, not one of them picked up any silverware. You might remember that race as the one where Hamilton took out Ferrari rival Raikkonen while waiting at a red light in the pit lane. It was one of the lows of the Brit's season, the key incident in a significant trough. His season picked up, spectacularly, with a brace of stunning wins at Silverstone and Hockenheim. Things were back on course for the McLaren man and he even taunted Massa for weakly conceding a place to him on way to the latter victory.</p> <p>That comment seems to have worked wonders on the Brazilian, who got his revenge (in what style!) at Budapest with an incredible start that ranks as the best of the season. Until then you were left wondering whether he ought to start worrying about the Italian mafia, as he was in his own dip of form - those five spins in the British grand prix being particularly difficult to forget. So then we come to Raikkonen, who after just two wins this season (both within the first four races) seems to have fallen out with his F2008. Qualifying, the Finn admits, is where he needs to make hay. In the past two grands prix he has lined up sixth on the grid, and knows he is unlikely to win races from the third row.</p> <p>Listening to what the drivers had to say after the Hungarian grand prix gave a hint at the psychology of the three. Massa, who due to engine failure three laps from the end lost a sure-fire victory that would have brought him level with Hamilton on four wins, was calm. Yes, it was frustrating, but he's got his mojo back and he knows it. Hamilton, curiously, stated that he'd made one of his best-ever starts - it's just that Massa's was better. He's been used to being top dog these past few grands prix, and needs to steel himself for a firmer challenge. And Raikkonen, who is not playing the part of the nonchalant reigning champion, admits things aren't going well, that he's making mistakes in qualifying but finds it strange that he can't get the right set-up.</p> <p>If anyone, Massa seems like the man who is ready to pick up the mantle - although I wouldn't have been writing that a couple of races ago. With the next grand prix at Valencia being a completely new circuit we are presented with something of a leveller, where the man to stand out could well be the one who picks up the gong at the end of year ceremony.</p> <h2>The beautiful race</h2> <br> <p>You won't have been expecting to read the words Tottenham Hotspur and Donington Park in the same sentence, but brace yourself for one of the strangest sporting combinations: the Superleague Formula. This new racing venture - billed as football at 300km/h - sees football club-backed cars going head-to-head on the racetrack. AC Milan driver Robert Doornbos (how strange does that sound) topped the recent test at Vallelunga. Other teams include Anderlecht, Olympiacos, FC Basel, Sevilla, Glasgow Rangers and Spurs. Since it pretty much defies description, all I can say is go along to the opening round, at Donington, on August 30-31 or <a href=\"http://superleagueformula.com/\">check out the website</a> to see what a racing car looks like in team kit.</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <br> <p>There was something very apt about Jules Bianchi's victory in the flagship formula three masters event at Zolder, unexpected as it was. The F3 rookie is in only his second car racing season, yet stuck his ART machine on the front row and then capitalised on a bad start from 2007 winner and pole-sitter Nico Hulkenberg to zoom away and claim a fine debut victory. The reason it makes such a great story is that Bianchi's uncle Lucien was a Le Mans 24 Hours winner and grand prix driver of the 1960s and gave his name to turn four.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <br> <p>MotoGP heads to Brno and veteran Rizla Suzuki driver Loris Capirossi will be the focus of some attention as he draws level with Alex Barros' record for the most number of MotoGP starts - 276.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Rod Thomas (vocals, guitar, loop pedal, synth, tambourine).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Rod Thomas is apparently one of the most recognised buskers on the London Underground with features about him on BBC London news and in thelondonpaper. Wait, come back. A crusty dog-on-a-string type wailing painful versions of Lay Lady Lay and Streets of London as you try to squeeze on to the tube he is not. He's a seriously good songwriter with a super-light pop touch who enhances his acoustic guitar-based tunes with a synth, a loop pedal for beats and handclaps, and if he had the chance, the opportunity and the funding, he'd probably chuck in an orchestra as well \u2013 you can just imagine the strings swelling epically as the chorus rises on Same Old Lines, his new single. <br> But don't feel too sorry for him and start scrabbling around in your pocket for loose change. He's not doing badly. He might be unsigned and having to put out his single on his own label, Self Raising, but Same Old Lines was produced by Julian Simmons (Guillemots, Midlake) and has been played for 17 consecutive weeks on Radio 1 Introducing, he's supported the likes of Sparks, Kathryn Williams and Noah &amp; the Whale on tour and the single is accompanied by a video, all 70s kids TV show lunacy and dodgy sock puppets, put together by the team behind recent Noah &amp; the Whale, Laura Marling and Mystery Jets promos.  Mostly, you don't need to pity the boy from Wales because he really is quite talented and the songs he's churning out really are quite lovely. How to categorise them is another matter. They're folky and forlorn, yes, but the beats are electronic and the handclaps crisp and urgent, the sort of rhythmic device you hear on disco records \u2013 this is probably why his music's been described as acoustic disco; we're going to go one further and call it folk funk, but then, we're crazy like that. There are aspects of the techno troubadour's act we're not comfortable with. At Glastonbury and Latitude this year he encouraged his audiences to clap and sing along, and some of his music does tend towards the crowd-pleasingly banal and happy-clappy. But songs like Your Love is a Tease, As If and You Get Goodbyes veer more towards the plaintive pop-with-a-pulse of Pet Shop Boys and Prefab Sprout, and - we're not imagining this - a number of other artists have discerned the music's potential for electrification, providing remixes and all manner of fussy cross-rhythms, although really the songs' beauty lies in their stark simplicity. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Joyous lo-fi folk-pop; folk with a flourish, a snap and a pop, and a few glances in the general direction of disco.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Sad chords + simple beats = the greatest Rod in pop since that bloke with the croaky voice and bird's nest hair.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make you miss your tube. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> See his career go down the tube.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Same Old Lines is released by Self Raising on October 6. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> James Yuill, Jack Penate, Guillemots, Paddy McAloon.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rodthomasmusic\">www.myspace.com/rodthomasmusic</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Playdoe. </p>",
  "<p><br>Tommy James and the Shondells. Photograph: Getty</p> <p>It's all gone a bit Tommy James and the Shondells around here this week. I've become obsessed with their song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ-P8Fgfhvk&amp;feature=related\">Crimson and Clover</a>. It's one of those tracks that everybody knows (I'm referring to people born before the Thatcher years), but files away in their vinyl-to-be-digitized-when-I've-got-a-spare-10-years pile. Well, last week I felt an overwhelming desire to hear it - and I'm still reeling from its perfection.</p> <p>While watching Monster, the biopic of executed serial killer <a href=\"http://thecia.com.au/reviews/m/images/monster-2004-poster-0.jpg\">Aileen Wuornos</a>, Crimson and Clover plays in the background as Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci become sapphically acquainted in a dingy motel room. There's hardly any flesh on display, but the scene is extraordinarily erotic, due to the tender, otherworldly sweetness of this song.</p> <p>Tommy James and the Shondells were one of the big US acts of the mid-60s, scoring massive hits with songs such as I Think We're Alone Now and Monie Monie. However, it was only after his main songwriter, Bo Gentry, went on strike in a dispute with Roulette records, that James had a go at writing himself.</p> <p>In the face of much derision and scepticism over just how far his talents might stretch, he and Shondells drummer Peter Lucia Jr descended into the bowels of New York City's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_Building\">Brill building</a>, and Crimson and Clover was the result.</p> <p>It's fantastically vague - perhaps the song's title is a reference to ladies' parts, or some sort of pharmaceutical, but I'm probably being sordid. More likely, they're just nice (and wonderfully inarticulate) words to sing and rhyme to: \"Now I don't hardly know her\", and \"Well if she come walkin' over\", etc.</p> <p>Several sites on the web mistakenly (or perhaps mischievously) attribute it to the <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/_/Crimson+and+Clover\">Velvet Underground</a>. It has exactly the same three chord-descending riff as the earliest incarnation of Sweet Jane - which was developing in the big apple at exactly the same time. Perhaps a pop detective could place Tommy James at Max's Kansas City, or prove Lou Reed was hiding in a guitar case, but it's just as likely with rock music barely into its adolescence, that two great minds could pluck the same riff from the ether and bring it down to earth. It's possible to love them both, with no overlap.</p> <p>The production is an immaculate accident, sounding like a budget, restrained Phil Spector with a map of The United States, crossing from the east coast to the west, and calling at all points in between. In five and a half minutes, it travels from aching adolescent mating call, to gum-chewing garage punk, to Nashville ballad, and ends in psychedelia - achieved by singing through the guitar amp tremolo input.</p> <p>The song was of course a massive hit in the winter of 1969, although it might have lasted longer, had radio stations not mistaken the title for Christmas is Over and stopped playing it.</p> <p>As the final verse of this hymn, I'll tell you that Kenny Laguna, the Shondells' keyboard player, went on to produce Joan Jett and the Blackhearts - the singer currently being my favourite person, due to her knocking all those dreadful I'll-do-anything-to-be-famous pretenders out of my daughter's affections, and replacing them with her I Love Rock'n'Roll, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdhonK8NMm8\">Crimson and Clover real self</a>.</p> <p>There's a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6444EeeQBiw&amp;feature=related\">fantastic recent clip</a> of Tommy James and the Shondells on YouTube. Although he is beginning to look strangely like <a href=\"http://superherouniverse.com/superheroes/images/fanart2/new/penguin-devito.jpg\">Danny deVito as the Penguin</a>, his voice is still utterly thrilling, and the song remains superb.</p> <p>Oh, one very last thing. Before changing their name to the Shondells, the band was called ... the Raconteurs.</p>",
  "<p>The past few days have posed an almost insurmountable challenge for the international community. Russia finally agreed a <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/about/newsletters/editorial_detail.html?id=1075\">ceasefire</a> \u2013 not because international diplomacy succeeded but because Russia had achieved its goals. Now the work of piecing together a sustainable peace begins, but on a very shaky foundation.</p> <p>This is not just the story of an enraged Russia settling scores with the west in a 21st-century version of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game\">great game</a>\" politics. It is the story of complex political disputes in Georgia that have lain unresolved for years. </p> <p>The tragedy is that this is a war that did not have to happen. Georgia has fallen into a trap laid by a hostile, resurgent Russia. Yet this is partly a trap of its own making. For years the Georgian government has failed to engage seriously with the needs and interests of its secessionist regions. Nor has it pursued a consistent strategy to attract these regions to Tbilisi (and away from reliance on Russia), and to persuade them that they could thrive in a united Georgia. It has instead tried to coerce them back into the fold through pressure, isolation and threats.</p> <p>Russia, an aggressive and unforgiving neighbour, has stepped into the void. It has taken advantage of the alienation felt by South Ossetia and Abkhazia to further its interests and to send a powerful message to the west and to recalcitrant neighbours that it is a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>Georgia's frustration with existing negotiations and peacekeeping formats had been building exponentially. President Saakashvili, who has staked his political career on restoring Georgia's territorial integrity, was keen to shake up political processes that were not delivering. Talk in Tbilisi was of \"unfreezing the frozen conflicts\". Russia, incensed by what it saw as western \"double standards\" over <a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3071363,00.html\">Kosovo</a>, and threatened by talk of Georgian and Ukrainian membership of Nato, also saw fit to escalate the situation, flexing its muscles and provoking Georgia.</p> <p>Saakashvili has always felt that the west should play a greater role in shoring up Georgia's security, and in resolving its conflicts. Latterly, the strategy has been one of \"the worse it gets, the better it gets\" \u2013 the assumption being that if it can be demonstrated to western diplomats that Russia is really a threat to Georgia, then the west will come to Georgia's rescue. But brinkmanship is a risky game, and it appears to have backfired on Saakashvili badly. There are serious questions over whether his leadership can survive this latest blow. </p> <p>The west must also bear a degree of responsibility. Consistently turning a blind eye to the shortcomings of Georgia's fledgling democracy and offering largely uncritical support has done the country no favours. US encouragement of Georgia's bid for Nato membership provoked Russian ire and raised Georgian expectations not only of political but even military backing.</p> <p>The lesson of this past week is surely that we ignore so-called dormant conflicts at our peril. This goes to the core of the problem, though \u2013 that there is a crisis in international systems for managing conflict, and building peace. The UN is paralysed by the veto powers of its permanent members and the world community does not know how to approach the issue of self-determination.</p> <p>At the root of this conflict lies the political visions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 very different from one another in some respects \u2013 visions that do not fit easily into the current world order, where states prevail. The onus is on the international community to find a consistent and creative response to what <a href=\"http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/22786004.html\">Timothy Garton Ash</a> terms the nationalist's question: \"Why should I be a minority in your country when you could be a minority in mine?\"</p> <p>Territorial integrity is not the only international law that has been violated in the past week. There is a need for governments and international organisations to give more prominence to international humanitarian norms and standards and human rights law, and publicly to acknowledge what appears to be the disproportionate use of force by both Russia and Georgia in pursuit of their objectives. </p> <p>It is crucial to the medium and long-term prospects for peace that a high-level investigation takes place into allegations of indiscriminate and targeted killings and human rights violations by all sides. </p> <p>There are many challenges ahead. There is no clear mediator who can be perceived as neutral now that Russia has proved itself to be a party to the conflict, and the west is seen as a friend of Georgia. Peacekeeping formats that are acceptable to Georgia, Russia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia will also be hard to find.</p> <p>Years of painstaking work to rebuild trust, to increase mutual understanding and to begin the long, patient process of reconciling communities have been wiped out by these few days' madness. Now it must start again.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's libel laws have come under attack from the United Nations committee on human rights for discouraging coverage of matters of major public interest. The use of the Official Secrets Act to deter government employees from raising important issues has also been criticised.</p> <p>The intervention by the UN comes in the wake of international disquiet over the use of British courts for \"libel tourism\", whereby wealthy plaintiffs can sue in the high court in London over articles that would not warrant an action in their own country.</p> <p>The criticisms are made as part of the committee's concluding observations on the report submitted by the UK on civil and political rights. UN member states are required to submit reports on human rights in their jurisdictions every three years.</p> <p>The committee warns that the British libel laws have \"served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work, including through the phenomenon known as libel tourism\".</p> <p>The case that has provoked the most concern is that of an American researcher, Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld, who was sued in London by a Saudi businessman and his two sons over a book that sold 23 copies over the internet into the UK, where it was never officially published. One chapter of the book was available online. </p> <p>The action led to the New York state legislature passing legislation to protect writers and publishers working there from defamation judgements in any country that does not give the same same freedom of speech rights as New York and US federal law. </p> <p>The committee's report highlights the grey area created by the internet whereby alleged libel can be read in different countries. There is a risk, warns the committee, that restrictive libel laws could affect legitimate international discussion, contrary to article 19 of the covenant on civil and political rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech \"regardless of borders\".</p> <p>The UK government has been urged to consider \"a so-called 'public figure' exception\" that would require a would-be claimant to prove actual malice by a publisher or author.</p> <p>This would apply in cases involving public officials and prominent public figures, as currently exists in the US, where a public figure can only sue for libel if he or she can demonstrate malice, recklessness or indifference to the truth and that the statement is false.</p> <p>On the Official Secrets Act, the committee \"remains concerned\" that powers under the act have been \"exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest, and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters\". The committee found the act is used even when issues of national security are not involved.</p> <p>The 2006 Terrorism Act's \"broad and vague\" definition of the offence of \"encouragement of terrorism\" was also criticised by the committee. </p> <p>Media law specialist Mark Stephens, of legal firm Finers Stephens Innocent, said: \"I think it is quite remarkable that the UK government has drawn these deficiencies in our libel laws to the attention of the United Nations, while at the same time libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the UN.\"</p>",

  "<p>The inaugural Champions League Twenty20 competition has been rescheduled. Originally slated to start on September 29, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa announced that the competition had been pushed back and would now be held in December. <br> The ICC had been unhappy that the tournament encroached upon the Champions Trophy, which ends on September 28, and requested a reschedule. The organisers of the Champions League, though under no obligation to relent, opted to conform to the ICC's wishes. </p> <p>A statement from the organisers read: \"While the Champions League Twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by ICC event rules, we have agreed to the ICC request as a gesture of goodwill.\"</p> <p>The new dates overlap with England's tour of India, but fall in the interlude between the final one-day international and the start of the first Test on December 11. </p> <p>Lalit Modi, chairman and commissioner of the Indian Premier League and vice-president of the BCCI, explained: \"We are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of December for the inaugural edition of the Champions League Twenty20.

  "<p>First of all, let me tell you what this isn't. It's not some \"I-was-lost-and-now-I'm-found\" sob story. These days, many people reach out to faith \"to find peace\". I had too much peace in my life already. In faith, I was looking to be troubled \u2013 on behalf of other people. Every film and pop starlet, trawling after a reason to exist, says, \"I'm not religious \u2013 but I am spiritual\". I don't have a spiritual bone in my body; but what I am, is religious. I believe, literally, in the God of the Old Testament, whom I understand as the Lord of the Jews and the Protestants. I'm a Christian Zionist, as well as a Christian feminist and a Christian socialist. But over the past two decades, almost without me knowing it, the Christian part has become the most important.</p> <p>These desperately-seeking-something starlets go about seeking enlightenment the wrong way; they see religion as a thing that will take them deeper into themselves, give them more \"me\" time. No wonder they never find what they're looking for; happiness, as survey after survey shows (<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7302609.stm\">the latest</a>, in April 2008, by the Royal Economic Society), is certainly found more often in the religious than the non-religious. But it must be a faith that encourages one to transcend the self rather than dwell even deeper on it, be it in the shape of philanthropy, voluntary work or, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/29/boweek129.xml\">in my case, both</a>. </p> <p>Once, of course, I was a teenage atheist; and it brings me no shame to say that, but it certainly makes me smile. I grew up, and stopped being an atheist, in my 20s, in the 1980s. But it was only when my parents died, within a year of each other at the turn of the century, that I became religious. I'm going to be a bit un-Christian here, but nothing makes me hoot, mock and retch like people who bleat that they stopped believing in God when their parents died. Don't get me wrong \u2013 if a parent buries a child and rails against God, I can see why. But to lose one's faith because of the death of a parent? That's what old people do, the swine, they die on you! And don't tell me about loving your parents \u2013 I loved mine just fine. I am an only child who, well into her early 20s, simply assumed that when the surviving parent kicked the bucket, I would quite cold-bloodedly top myself because life would be simply incomprehensible without them. But when my father died in 1999 and my mother in 2000, I stood in the same church twice in two years and felt the same sense of what I can best describe as joy as I watched the two coffins move away from me. While all around me wept, I was filled with the absolute certainty that they were on their way to a better place. It was all I could do to keep from laughing out loud, both times. Boy, with a nasty rep like mine, how great would that have come across to assembled friends and family. </p> <p>But it wasn't nasty ... it was faith.</p> <p>Although it is often they who accuse us of being babyish, needing a big daddy in the sky to lean on, there is something profoundly immature about atheists. That surly, self-satisfied certainty that insists that one is the first person, ever, to see with a white-hot, burning clarity straight to the heart of society's attempts to manipulate and control us all for its own ends.</p> <p>Today, atheism is big business with the success of books like The God Delusion. If you want to get ahead, be a heretic! Something, however, has been lost. Say the word \"atheist\" 100 years ago and it conjured up a vision of sexy, freewheeling rebels celebrating life, love and creativity in their rejection of a higher power. Say it now and a vision of fun-hating killjoys, desperately scared that somewhere a Christian is having a good time by singing lustily in church on a Sunday morning, comes to mind. And, sadly, the alleged \"humanist morality\" never happened \u2013 to this day, 80% of all unpaid and unself-interested voluntary and charity work is faith-driven. </p> <p>The problem, which western atheists miss, is that to be a heretic here requires no bravery whatsoever. On the contrary, when the mocking of Judeo-Christian belief is a mainstay of prime-time entertainment and has been so since The Life of Brian, being an atheist in the west can easily be seen as a desire to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/religion.usa\">on the winning side</a>. </p> <p>When one considers the shocking plight of British Muslims who seek to convert to Christianity, it seems to me quite offensive that Christianity should be dismissed by Dawkins and his like in the same breath as Islam. Similarly, Dawkins' critique of Judaism seems way too aggressive, when one compares it to the excesses of other belief systems. The oldest and least evangelical of the monotheistic religions, it is also arguably the most civilised and liberal; there are female judges and rabbis in the Old Testament, which makes the C of E's foot-dragging over the ordination of women look a bit sad \u2013 and let's not even mention the Catholic and Muslim attitude to women being allowed to preach. Interestingly, the only truly brave, non-narcissistic atheists I can think of are apostates \u2013 both women, both born Muslims. While their western white brothers in non-belief caper around fancying themselves, like superannuated rock stars, with the super-smug sense of safety that being an atheist in a Protestant country bestows, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2325128.htm\">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> and <a href=\"http://www.irshadmanji.com/\">Irshad Manji</a> move from safe house to safe house \u2013 in fear of their lives rather than bad book reviews.</p> <p>So that's my story. It's not a perfect church, but it's my church. And even though I'd prefer a few more hymns along the lines of Onward Christian Soldiers of a Sunday, I don't mind waiting. Unlike the wretched Church of Rome, our leaders don't hold onto the top spot till they peg out, so, hopefully, Bishops Sentamu or Nazir-Ali will be leading our raggle-taggle legions soon. I've come to the conclusion that the rejuvenation of our church will come from its non-white leaders and worshippers, unburdened as they are with pallid guilt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm about to start my second volunteer job, and I shall doubtless also continue to give away money like a sailor on shore leave. It's not so much the camel and the eye of the needle jive I subscribe to \u2013 more the great Andrew Carnegie's strict Protestant dictum: \"He who dies rich dies shamed.\"</p> <p>My favourite vicar, the <a href=\"http://www.tlig.org/en/testimonies/churchpos/gavin/\">Reverend Gavin Ashenden</a> of Sussex University, never says, \"I am a Christian,\" but rather \"I'm trying to be a Christian\". Me too. Between the darkness that faces me from within and the darkness that faces me from without, it may just prove to be the hardest thing I've ever done. I love it.</p>",
  "<p>As blogs have become mainstream (see TechCrunch etc) and mainstream media have started blogging (in my case, since 2001), the two areas have started to overlap. Bloggers have naturally become PR targets, as just another way to get the message across. But where does this leave bloggers? What value is a sales pitch that says: \"we're like TechCrunch, but smaller?\"</p> <p>This is a question that blogger Robert Scoble has been asking recently, and he's rounded it all up with a long post: <a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2008/08/13/pr/\">What do the freaking tech bloggers want?</a></p> <p>It's a running conversation and the opening section covers the background. However, scroll down to the section that starts: \"<strong>OK, Scoble, wrap it up. What are some things that you tech blogger types want from PR?</strong>\" In nine points, he provides a good guide to the direction PR 2.0 should be going. And as he implies in his first point, it has to be personal:</p> <blockquote> PR people are doing themselves a disservice when they just treat journalists and bloggers like cattle. Every time I get an email pitch it reminds me that I'm being treated like cattle. Especially when I get together with Arrington and Malik and Lacy and other bloggers and we see that we got the same pitch. Moooooo! </blockquote> <br> <p>Of course, Scoble is correct is saying this is true for journalists working for mainstream outlets, as well as bloggers: the personal approach works at all levels. It always has. It's just moved from the pub or the golf course to Twitter.</p> <p>But because there are not enough \"personal hours\" to go around, this means a handful of bloggers (eg Robert Scoble) will get preferential treatment, just the way a handful of tech journalists on The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Business Week and Newsweek get preferential treatment.</p> <p>So how is this different?</p> <p>I'm not saying blogs don't have a point: after all, I've put myself out for years to help get the Guardian into blogging. But it still seems to me that, from a PR point of view, blogs and MSM are all parts of the same very wide spectrum....</p> <p>And at least the boring old press release puts everyone on the same level.</p>",

  "<p><br>The natural urban landscape is making way for sterile corporate developments. Photograph: Graeme Robertson</p> <p>When it comes to the cities of the world the general attitude seems to be: get out! The moment you have enough money, or your work allows, or you begin to think sentimentally about views and birdsong, leave! If cities were people, they'd be the last one to be picked for the football team. If they were food, they'd be Spam.</p> <p>Prince Charles spoke for many when he described cities as \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/gmcrops.food\">unsustainable unmanageable, degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness</a>\", (OK, maybe not exactly how most people would phrase it but the sentiment is the same). </p> <p>Cities are fair game for a kicking. If the authorities want to tear them down and rebuild them, they are doing us all a favour and it can only be an improvement; that is the general sentiment, shared by right-wing gated-community dwellers and deep-green environmentalists across the board.</p> <p>But from where I stand they're all wrong, and every time I come across about a swath of city being destroyed to make way for the modern world, I mourn. </p> <p>One of the most haunting things I've read recently is the description in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Rich-First-Changing-China/dp/0701178973\">Duncan Hewitt's \"Getting Rich First\"</a>, a book about modern China, of the city centres being razed overnight during the past 15 years. Beijing, for centuries, had been made up of '<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2008/jun/05/greenbuilding.ethicalliving?picture=334608097\">hutongs</a>' or lanes, meandering between old courtyard houses, but modernisation began in the early 1990s, and destruction was both tremendous and indiscriminate (in China you do not need to argue with English Heritage for two years if you want to knock down a neighbourhood). </p> <p>Hewitt would periodically leave China and return to find Beijing more and more unrecognisable. He writes that \"a joke went the rounds that Beijing was the only place in the world where you had to phone a restaurant before going out for dinner, not to reserve a table but to check that the building hadn't been demolished. This struck me as a little exaggerated until one evening, when, after driving up and down the same street several times in an increasingly desperate search for a favourite restaurant, we realised that it had indeed been swallowed up by a large building site. We retreated to a large and evidently very popular restaurant on the other side of the road... the food was very good and a few weeks later my friend decided to go there again; when he arrived he found only a corrugated-iron fence, a large hole in the ground, and signs announcing the city's next construction project.\" </p> <p>And here in London we are equally cavalier about our past: I went to Spitalfields market recently, which was, until a few years ago, a market full of raucous vitality, drawing people and mess and life from all over London. Then the City stepped in, and bought it up. They built over most of it leaving a small shell of the old building at one end where - when I went there - there are still a few market stalls. But (I may just have gone on a bad day of course), the stalls feel as if they're more for show than part of a real market: the bustle and chaos of a proper market is eviscerated beneath the glass and steel of the imposing <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/Projects/1146/Default.aspx\">Norman Foster building</a> that has taken over. </p> <p>And now tower blocks are planned for neighbouring Shoreditch: it's the repetition of a pattern which goes back centuries and which perfectly reflects the pattern of behaviour which has got us into so much trouble on the environmental front.</p> <p>This is what we do. We group together, we humans, like certain insect species - ants and bees come to mind - and we build complex hives or nests in which we can live together. Jane Jacob's amazing book <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs\">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>, published in 1961, perfectly anatomises the wondrous and fragile balance of a successful city neighbourhood, with life on the streets, people keeping an eye out for each other, people talking, living side by side and helping with raising children or looking after aged parents. (This balance can obviously exist in a town or a village too: what I am interested in right here is the fact that this can also exist in cities). </p> <p>When a city works well, it can be the best way imaginable to live: you can have a breath of greenery, but also be able to walk to your friend's house, you can stroll with a buggy through energetic streets instead of having to get into a car, you can feel part of humanity instead of cut off from it. </p> <p>So what do we do to these beautiful hives and ants' nests that we have so carefully constructed and maintained for centuries and sometimes millennia? We don't allow people the materials to continue building their nests in the way they wish to build them. Instead we stamp on them. We pull the wings off. We build the <a href=\"http://www.stadiumguide.com/beijing.htm\">Bird's Nest</a>(so ironic to call a huge monolith of steel after the frail brilliance of a bird's home) or Norman Foster's Allen &amp; Overy HQ. </p> <p>We build something new where the old was working perfectly well. I would argue that what is being destroyed here is not something of abstract historical value, but something living, something of the best ways we interact with each other. </p> <p>In Jacobs book (an attack on town-planning habits) she points out that cities need to be thought of as systems of \"organised complexity\". Handled with care and sensitivity, cities could be bright bright green, sustainable, joyful places to live. What, though, are the chances? Should we all forget it, run for the hills, and leave the cities to the people who can't afford an exit route?</p>",

Later, at least five explosions were reported near Gori. It was not clear whether renewed fighting had broken out between Georgian and Russian forces, but there had been a tense stand-off between the two sides earlier in the day.<br> Elsewhere in Georgia, a camera crew from the Associated Press saw heavily armed Russian soldiers and military vehicles in the western town of Zugdidi. Some of the troops wore blue peacekeeping helmets but others had green camaouflage helmets.</p> <p><br>In Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, reinforced the Kremlin's determination not to guarantee Georgia's borders. \"One can forget about any talk about Georgia's territorial integrity because, I believe, it is impossible to persuade South Ossetia and Abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the Georgian state.\" His remarks came as the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, was meeting leaders of the two separatist regions.</p> <p>As confusion mounted about how Russia was responding to US calls to pull out its troops to end the week-long conflict, a Russian general said his forces would soon start to return control of Gori to Georgia.</p> <p>Gori lies south of disputed South Ossetia and controls the main east-west road through Georgia. Yesterday, Russia denied it even had troops in the area despite witnesses saying they saw tanks on the streets.<br> Russia's Major-General Vyacheslav Borisov said: \"For another two days troops will stay in the region to \u2026 hand over control functions to Georgian law-enforcement bodies, after which they will leave.\"</p> <p>Russian news agencies quoted him as saying: \"City police will start working officially here and carry out their duties to maintain security.\"</p> <p>Russian and Georgian soldiers are reported to have briefly confronted each other at a checkpoint on Gori's outskirts around midday local time.</p> <p>Some Georgian police are reported to have said a Russian withdrawal broke down after their South Ossetian allies refused to leave.</p> <p>Witnesses said yesterday that irregular forces had joined up with the Russian army to loot and burn villages and kill civilians between South Ossetia and Gori. The claims of atrocities have not been verified.</p> <p>Both sides have signed a ceasefire requiring forces to return to the positions they held before the conflict started last week. But the truce allows Russian forces to take unspecified \"security measures\".</p> <p>The Kremlin could try to keep troops in Georgia proper while claiming to be protecting South Ossetia. Russian troops moved into the region six days ago after Georgia began a military operation to retake it from separatist control.</p> <p>Russia has rejected calls from the United States and Europe to preserve Georgia's territorial integrity. It argues South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another separatist region, were never part of an independent, post-Soviet Georgia.</p> <p>The US has begun sending humanitarian aid to Georgia, with the first shipment arriving escorted by troops last night. Supplies included cots, blankets and medicine for displaced civilians.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, has warned the Kremlin to \"keep its word and act to end this crisis\".

  "<p>It weighs in at a thumping 1.6 kilograms, and is 365 pages long. But I found there is something oddly familiar about <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/research/cm/cmr08/\">Ofcom's 2008 UK Communications Market Repor</a>t, published today.</p> <p>The theme Ofcom choses to highlight, at a time of galloping inflation, is that the average household spend on communications services, from television to broadband, is on the decline. We're getting more media for our bucks, apparently.</p> <p>This had me scurrying back to check Ofcom's 2006 report, which, sure enough, also announced that average household spend on communications services had fallen as a proportion of total spending - for the first time in five years.</p> <p>In other words, Ofcom is highlighting an ongoing trend and, probably, one of its main claims to success as a regulator.</p> <p>So, in 2007-2008, for the third year running, the cost of communications services have have fallen for consumers, according to Ofcom.</p> <p>Each UK household spent an average of \u00a393.48 a month on media and telecoms services, after a 6% year on year drop in telecoms prices and a 4% cut in broadband prices last year. As if to prove the point, while I was writing this, BT Broadband cold called and offered me a cut of \u00a34 a month in my tariff, and a free printer, if I commit for a year.</p> <p>Back in 2006 communications costs were declining largely due to falling tariffs for fixed line telephony and the start of fierce competition for broadband customers, as local loop unbundling got underway.</p> <p>Now the fall in prices is due to bargain hunting, people finding it easier to switch internet providers, landline and mobile phone contracts.</p> <p>Meanwhile service providers hungry to expand their subscriber base such as BSkyB have bundled together cut price deals for the triple play of pay-TV, a land line and broadband.</p> <p>However, oddly, Ofcom's report for 2008 finds that there has been a significant drop off in the use of voice over the internet protocol services, such as Skype. Why? Perhaps it is because mobile deals with copious free minutes are so good that VOIP only really represent value to international callers. Or perhaps it is just an irritating rigmarole to set up and use?</p> <p>On the media front, the Ofcom report provides little comfort for traditional broadcasters such as ITV.</p> <p>Though the UK advertising market grew by 6.3% - the first year it had outstripped inflation since 2005 - the majority of growth came from internet advertising.</p> <p>For the first time in 2007 the internet outstripped the combined net revenues of ITV1, Channel 4, S4C and Channel Five - \u00a32.8bn compared to \u00a32.4bn.</p> <p>Ofcom points out that the commercial success of the internet is a particular UK phenomenon, compared with the US and Europe. Strip out internet revenue growth and the rest of UK advertising is flat.</p> <p>There's also a growing gap between the fortunes of pay-TV - ie Sky - and everyone else. The UK TV subscription market was worth \u00a34.3bn in 2007, up 6.4% year on year; while advertising funded television, at \u00a33.5bn, was up 2.2%.</p> <p>Accordingly, spending on first run originated UK programming fell back again, by 5.6% year on year, to \u00a32.6bn.</p> <p>The outlook for advertiser-funded commercial TV remains uncertain in both the short and long term and future stability cannot be taken for granted, warns Ofcom.</p> <p>We may not have yet felt the full impact of the economic down turn. Ofcom predicts that this could increase pressure on free to air commercial broadcasters to find new or alternative sources of revenue. However, the regulator does not consider whether belt tightening will lead to households cancelling their Sky subscriptions.</p> <p>In a further dollop of bad news Ofcom explodes the theory that the main channels fare better in Freeview homes because they faced less competition.</p> <p>\"Their popularity has declined faster on Freeview, a drop of 21% per cent between March 2004 to 2008 compared with 3% in cable and satellite homes over the same period,\" Ofcom reported.</p> <p>The one thriving television sector appears to be independent production, which experienced strong growth in 2007-2008, increasing its turnover by 9.4% year on year to \u00a32.14bn. This means that since 2005 independent producers have enjoyed a compound annual revenue growth of 15.6%, scooping up orders for entertainment and sports strands, while in-house production at the BBC and ITV has declined.</p> <p>But can this possibly continue? Will the independent production sector be affected the declining fortunes of their commercial broadcasting customers? Has the balance of power swung too far in their favour?</p> <p>Still, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/14/ofcom.digitaltvradio\">traditional TV remains the medium people would find it hardest to live without</a> - except young adults between 16 and 24, who prefer the internet.</p> <p>Those sharp differences in media and telcoms consumption by age also remain. Older people are much lower users of mobile phones - only 7% of over 65s make a mobile call every day, compared with 50% of all adults. And they spend significantly more time watching television and listening to the radio. Overall over 65s are less trusting of information, including news, on the web.

  "<p><strong>By Robert Andrews</strong></p> <p>While <strong>NBC</strong> faces <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-nbcs-totalitarian-olympics-more-on-restrictions-online-video-only-after/\">criticism</a> over its digital offering, over in the UK, the <strong>BBC</strong> is roaring on with an all-out, open <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/olympics10.shtml\">strategy</a> for its biggest ever interactive sports event, comprising multiple <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/live_action/default.stm\">live streams</a>, rolling text updates, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/bbcsportolympics/\"><strong>Flickr</strong> photos</a> - and no holding live back for prime time. <strong>BBC Sport Interactive</strong> head <strong>Ben Gallop</strong>, a veteran of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/tv_coverage/3839815.stm\">previous <strong>Olympic</strong> campaigns</a>, told me video output has doubled and the website clocked more video views in the first two days of these games than during the entire fortnight at <strong>Athens 2004</strong>: \"We're just seeing enormous traffic, record levels that we've frankly never seen before...\"</p> <p>Though the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/genres/sport/olympics/schedules/\">array</a> of competitons taking place in <strong>China</strong> might give a scheduler a headache, some 2,750 hours of coverage are made available behind the interactive <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/digital/tv/tv_interactive.shtml\">red button</a> on digital TV platforms, where viewers can make their own selection from up to seven simultaneous events, picture-in-picture...</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Interactive:</strong> \"There isn't an event like the Olympics in terms of offering viewer choice, and we know from previous games that nothing drives red button usage the way the Olympics does. In 2004, the first interactive Olympics we did, we had more than 10 million people go interactive just on the satellite platform - that's more than double the next most popular event the BBC's ever done, <strong><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4072922.stm\">Wimbledon</a></strong> with about four million. More than anything we can do - whether it's <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/2008/interactivetv/\">Glastonbury</a></strong> or another sports event - the Olympics gets people looking on interactive TV.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Online:</strong> All the iTV streams are also <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/live_action/default.stm\">pumped on to the web</a>, along with rolling text updates, geo-tagged <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bbcsport_claire\"><strong>Twitter</strong> streams</a> and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics/7493757.stm\">map mashup</a>s. But video is the big draw and the Olympics site is mainly benefiting from <strong>BBC News and Sport</strong> sites' <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-broadband-content-bits-bbc-video-increase-video-traffic-up\">abandonment</a> of pop-up <strong>Windows Media Video</strong> and <strong>RealVideo</strong> in favour of in-page <strong>Flash</strong> video. Short recorded clips within stories are proving popular: \"These games are slightly antisocial, happening when most people in the country are either in bed or in work. The opportunities for people to just sit in front of the telly all day, waiting for the action, aren't as obvious as Athens, when it was a European timezone. They need to get a fix of the action wherever they are - that means we need to offer them a really strong on-demand service and make sure we make the live action available wherever they are.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Rights:</strong> With so much more video being pumped out, Gallop is conscious of the BBC's duty to protect that content: \"The IOC are among the most stringent in sports rights when it comes to digital platforms, and we have a very strict arrangement with them that our content must not leak outside the UK.\" But, while <a href=\"http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-interview-perkins-miller-svp-digital-media-nbc-sports-olympics-seismic-/\"><strong>NBC</strong> has worked hard on fingerprinting solutions</a> to remove its Olympics output from sites like <strong>YouTube</strong>, Gallop's BBC is far more hands-off: \"That's really for the <strong>IOC</strong>, that's their role to monitor and see what happens. We're just not in a position to control how people use TV coverage and put it up online.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 iPlayer:</strong> The VOD service, available online and TV, is used for catch-up of whole sports events, while the website is used to show short clips and live action: \"When it comes to sport, the real appeal is with the BBC Sport website\", Gallop said. What's more, though it hosts all BBC programmes from the last week, the Olympics undertaking is so large that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/categories/olympics\"><strong>iPlayer</strong></a> is unable to host all aired Olympics videos as VOD, Gallop said - not for rights concerns, \"but because of bandwidth issues\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 On NBC:</strong> \"Every broadcaster has a strategy for dealing with something like this. We are not a commercial organisation, NBC are; that may be why they've chosen to hold back some of their content from the web. For us, it's all about universal access, we want universal reach, we're not about making money, we just want more and more people to access the games in however many ways they want to. There aren't any limitations for us, I'm sure they have very different considerations.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 London 2012:</strong> The BBC is experimenting delivering video clips to <strong>T-Mobile</strong> customers via its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/olympics/\">mobile Olympics site</a>; other networks don't seem to have been able to cope with the requirements: \"We've had discussions with all the mobile operators, it hasn't been possible to work with all of them on it, largely for technical reasons. In terms of challenges, that's been an interesting one... We have an editorial vision for what we want to achieve, but it's working in the realities of the UK mobile market; there are challenges. In the future, it's something we want to do with all of them.</p> <p>\"This particular platform is more about how it develops in the future. We don't see it as a mature service. Beijing is an end in itself, but it's also a stepping stone for <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/handover/index.php\">London</a> - we want to try things out, see how they work to learn for four years' time.\" The main priority is to ensure that \"every bit of action\" is made available digitally.<br></p>",
  "<p><br>Playin' the blues ain't like dustin' crops, kid (OK, enough Star Wars references - Ed) ... Tallan 'T-Man' Latz. Photograph: Morry Gash/AP</p> <p>The strange case of <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iy9aOupjrG4OCC_l5hke3lHdmhiQD92GNHS81\">censured eight-year-old blues prodigy Tallan Latz</a> raises all kinds of questions. The Wisconsin wunderkind has found himself the victim of an anonymous smear campaign from local authorities and - most likely - a bunch of vengeful grown-up musos who reckon the blues is no suitable pastime for an eight-year-old. They may have a point. But I'm more concerned about how it's even possible. Apparently, even cowgirls get the blues. Can the same be said of children? </p> <p>Last week, BBC1's The Making Of Me saw former hot-panted teenage violin virtuoso <a href=\"http://www.vanessa-mae.nu/images/Wet_T_Shirt95/VP95.jpg\">Vanessa Mae</a> go on a journey of self-discovery, trying to define whether her prodigious talent was a result of innate talent or her nightmarish, oppressive mother. She came to a suitably vague conclusion. But this doesn't seem to be about innate talent or child labour. This is about the blues itself.</p> <p>Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues\">defines blues</a> as emerging from \"an accessible form of self-expression in African-American communities in the United States from spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads.\"</p> <p>The altogether funkier UrbanDictionary reckons that \"Robert Johnson is The Father; Muddy Waters is The Son; Jimi Hendrix is The Holy Spirit - This is the Holy Trinity of The Blues.\" But for the connotations that most of us would associate with the blues, we'd go with <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blues\">the sixth definition they list</a>.</p> <p>Blues might be a technical term, a music originating from Africa, feeding into the genesis of what we know as rock'n'roll. But when we think of the blues (and indeed, when we play, sing, cry or drink to it), we're thinking of a gruff and grizzled subculture, hard won by the trauma of poverty, hardship, plain bad luck or being done wrong by a woman.</p> <p>So is it even possible for an eight year old to catch the blues? Tallan's precociously talented for sure, and he seems to have a suitably old soul. He might say he enjoys playing the guitar because it \"puts smiles on people's faces,\" but the kid certainly has the chat down. \"Because I got more inspiration, I got more sadness in me,\" he says. \"I'm just feelin' it.\"</p> <p>So why are the likes of Jennifer Ortiz (Wisconsin Equal Rights Division's spokesperson, who's worried about child labour) and the ageing bluesmen so desperate to keep Tallan from playing his blues? Genuine concern for child welfare? Professional jealousy? Or an altogether darker fear of the secret and mysterious blues serum being leaked to those who cannot understand its true nature?</p> <p>Is young Tallan meddling with forces he can't yet hope to understand?</p> <p>(If you want to hear something <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/humanskab\">really troubling</a>, check out Dead Baby Blues by Washington 10-year-old The Human Skab. Yikes.)</p>",
  "<p><strong>11.10am</strong> Despite more overnight rain, play is scheduled to start here at 11.30am, which almost seems a shame given the off-field shenanigans currently convulsing Lancashire.</p> <p>In case you've missed it, a brief summary of events so far: on Tuesday, manager Mike Watkinson announced that the cricket committee had decided not to offer Dominic Cork a new contract. Cork promptly expressed his surprise and disappointment at the decision, and his determination to \"come back and haunt Lancashire\", and yesterday the county's captain, Stuart Law, poured further fuel on the fire by revealing n a typically entertaining press conference that he had not been consulted.</p> <p>The pick of numerous juicy quotes was his reference to \"the people drinking gin and tonics\" up in the committee room, but that could land Law in a spot of bother. Lancashire's cricket committee now consists of Watkinson, Clive Lloyd, Paul Allott - who was recently co-opted back on to the committee because of the serious illness, and now death, of Colin Walker - and Jack Simmons, who are chaired by Geoff Ogden. They will all presumably be furious, especially Simmons, who has never come across as the gin-and-tonic type.</p> <p>Heaven knows what will happen next, but there will surely be plenty of knowing grins in Chelmsford and Derby this morning, from those people who following their first-hand experience of Law and Cork were always convinced that having them in the same dressing room, as captain and senior pro, was a combustible combination likely to land Lancashire in trouble.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> At last some play, and it was worth the wait, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Taunton</em>. Justin Langer added three more frantic fours to the 55 he made on Tuesday before top-edging a pull off Jade Dernbach and watching with what was presumably a mixture of horror and disbelief as Usman Afzaal ran in from the square-leg fence to take a superb tumbling catch. Those of you who can remember Afzaal's fielding on the New Zealand tour of 2001-02 will know what I mean. After that, though, it was all Somerset, which won't surprise followers of Surrey's depressing efforts this summer.</p> <p>As they coasted from 110 without loss to 229 for one at lunch, the spoils were shared between Marcus Trescothick, who is six runs short of a third hundred of the season, and - on 45 - the South African allrounder Zander de Bruyn, who can look both elegant (one glorious back-foot cover drive off Chris Jordan looked like Mike Atherton) and curiously pragmatic (his shovels through the leg-side off the spinners are more Paul Collingwood). But the overall effect was convincing enough.</p> <p>Trescothick reached his half-century in the second over of the day with an extra-cover drive for four off Dernbach, then went quiet before replaying the stroke twice in two balls off Jordan 20 overs later. In the meantime he was dropped by Saqlain Mushtaq off his own bowling on 56 - a sharp but catchable low chance - shortly after pulling Matt Nicholson imperiously for four. Watching him score runs is enough to make an England fan wistful.</p> <p>Whether Somerset can now get anything out of this game other than bonus points depends on a) the weather, which has an unreliable feel to it today, and b) the resilience of Surrey's batting, which has had an unreliable feel to it all season. I favour the weather as the more likely obstacle.</p> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> There was just enough time for Marcus Trescothick to reach his hundred and Zander de Bruyn his fifty before the rain returned, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Taunton</em>. Trescothick eased the second ball of the session from Pedro Collins past mid-on for four to move to 98, then watched as De Bruyn skipped down the track to Usman Afzaal in the next over to hammer him down the ground and bring up his half-century from 101 balls.</p> <p>Two deliveries later, Trescothick dabbed Afzaal to fine leg for a single and celebrated his third ton of the summer, from just 148 balls. Then, with Somerset cruising on 248 for one, the weather closed in. I saw Jon Batty at breakfast this morning and told him it would rain at 2pm. But this isn't the time to be smug - I'd love to see Trescothick cut loose now that he's got his century out of the way.</p> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> Tea at Taunton, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, and it's been quite a mini-session. In the 18 overs made possible by the weather, Somerset added 123 runs for the loss of Marcus Trescothick, who blunderbussed his way to 158 off 186 balls before top-edging a hefty sweep off Saqlain Mushtaq, and, right at the end, James Hildreth. Zander de Bruyn moved to a century of his own, but it was the batting of Trescothick that will linger longest in the mind's eye.</p> <p>When the players came out at 3.30pm following a post-lunch shower, Trescothick had 101, De Bruyn 55 and Somerset were already healthily placed on 248 for one off 55.5 overs. Then Surrey fell to pieces - or rather they were taken to pieces. De Bruyn cut, pulled and swept four boundaries in the first three overs after the break before Trescothick hit the first four balls of a Pedro Collins over for four, six (over midwicket), four and six (over long-on). The next delivery, a no-ball, was scooped just over short midwicket's head, which meant Somerset had scored 24 runs off the first four deliveries of the hapless Collins' over, and it needed two bouncers to prevent further damage.</p> <p>Matt Nicholson duly missed a tough chance at slip when Trescothick edged Saqlain on 131, but a late-cut for four off the same bowler, followed by a slog to the boundary off Nicholson and, next ball, an extra-cover drive brought up his 150. The third fifty had taken just 31 deliveries, and Trescothick celebrated by carting the next one straight back over Nicholson's head for six. When De Bruyn cut Jade Dernbach for four to move to 96, the pair had added 100 runs in the 45 minutes since the resumption. Magnificent stuff!</p> <p>Trescothick fell in the next over, but De Bruyn eased to his third hundred of the summer in the one after that with a quick single off Dernbach, despite Mark Ramprakash throwing down the stumps from midwicket and briefly causing umpire George Sharp to think about a run-out verdict.</p> <p>Hildreth departed soon after for 10, trying to hit Saqlain into Taunton town centre, but it was about all Surrey had to get excited about in a passage of play that pretty well summed up their season. It has also given Somerset the chance to secure maximum bonus points from this match at the very least: at tea they are 371 for three as the rain begins to fall yet again.</p>",
  "<p>Abhinav Bindra, the first Indian to ever win a solo gold medal at the Olympic Games, had his sights tampered with prior to winning the men's 10m air rifle title on Monday, according to an official from the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI).</p> <p>Baljit Singh Sethi, the NRAI's secretary general and chef de mission of the India team, claimed that Bindra \"told us after the final, but I told him 'even if someone had done it you should forget it now that you have won'.\"</p> <p>Bindra's personal mental trainer, Amit Bhattacharjee, suggested that something must have been amiss following the shooter's opening effort. \"When Abhinav fired the first shot in the sighting time, it hit the target between the fourth and fifth rings,\" he told the Hindustan Times. \"It is unthinkable of any shooter competing at this level to score 4.5 points.\"</p> <p>However, the India team has not lodged an official complaint and the IOC is unlikely to launch an investigation based on media reports alone. Sethi was keen to play down the alleged incident, adding that \"once you get a medal, it should be forgotten. Something like this happening is very, very rare and even if it has, it is difficult to prove.\"</p> <p>In the early hours of this morning, Bindra returned to a hero's welcome in New Delhi, attending receptions thrown for him by India's president, Pratibha Patil, and prime minister, Manmohan Singh.</p>",

Some 3.3 million people watched Tom Daley and Blake Aldridge fail to fly in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/12/tvratings.television\">synchronised diving</a> on Monday. The event took place while most of the UK was having its breakfast, outside normal office hours. But what about those that are squarely positioned when working Britons should be, well, working? </p> <p>It's alright for some. In our office, for example, there are flat-screen televisions suspended from the ceilings at strategic points, with the sound down, so that we can keep up with the latest news - or the judo - whether we like it or not.</p> <p>But in plenty of offices a television is not a vital source of information, it's simply a distraction. In previous years when important football games have taken place during the day, bosses have often been persuaded to allow a TV to be brought in or workers to sneak out to somewhere with a big screen.

  "<p><strong>What you've missed</strong></p> <p>Not a lot, in truth - at least on the field of play. There was no sign of Michael Phelps, except in the pancake houses of the Olympic Village, nor a whiff of a British medal. What there was, however, was a joint IOC/Bocog press conference that was feistier than a E102-addled teen. Human rights and press freedoms all came up - as did the question of whether a single Chinese citizen had been granted permission to use the special 'Protest Parks'.</p> <p>Eventually Wang Wei, the general secretary of Bocog, snapped. \"After 30 years of reform China has developed greatly,\" he said. \"People enjoy more freedom. People are living a good life. Everyone is happy. But there are a few people who have come here to peek, to be critical, to dig into the small details and find fault.\" Yep, he was talking about us in the media.</p> <p>Wei's mood wasn't helped by Channel 4's Alex Thomson asking the IOC whether it was \"in any way embarrassed\" by the Chinese government \"lying through its teeth\" about improving human rights. Giselle Davies, the IOC's ice-cool communications director, prevaricated three times before Thomson, who had to resist efforts from two volunteers to force the microphone from him, snapped. \"We're not getting anywhere are we?\" he said. \"Are the IOC embarrassed about the Chinese government's record on human rights? One more chance?\" It wasn't taken.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Sebastian Coe has written off British chances of medals in the athletics, which begins tomorrow, claiming: \"I don't think there will be many here.\" Meanwhile, in the absence of Phelps the spotlight in the pool fell on Kosuke Kitajima, who retained his 200m Olympic breaststroke title.

The law has now been changed as to what schools can serve but the kids have rejected this healthy improvement, with <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-1033836/Number-pupils-having-school-dinners-plunges-Jamie-Olivers-healthy-meals-campaign.html\">the number of children taking school meals shrinking</a>. </p> <p>The free-range campaign began at the start of the year with a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/river-cottage/hughs-chicken-run/\">special season on Channel 4</a> and is still going strong. Sainsbury's have just announced that during 2008 so far there's been a <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/2008/08/07/111546/sainsburys-launches-new-range-of-higher-welfare-chicken.html\">60% increase in the sale of free-range</a> (or, as they prefer to say, \"higher welfare\") chicken. To the delight of Jamie and Hugh they have even launched a new range to accommodate demand, and a YouGov poll says 38% of shoppers now look for such ethical foods. </p> <p>With these successes, you can see why a well-known figure advising us on food seems like a good idea to Boris. But the problem with Rosie Boycott is that what makes her eligible for the position is also what undermines her in this context; Boycott is now living the good life in Somerset, running a small farm where she raises pigs and grows her own vegetables. How this puts her in tune with the needs of city-dwellers isn't immediately clear. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-450039/My-life-smallholder-Rosie-Boycott.html\">Consider the following dispatch</a>:</p> <blockquote> Standing in the Victorian potting shed in our walled garden, I shake a tiny coriander seed out of its packet and drop it into the soil in a pot. I then do the same with marjoram, green basil, purple basil, flat-leaf parsley, curly parsley, chervil, oregano and peppermint. </blockquote> <p>Now, if do live in an urban environment, try and apply that to your own life. Would you follow this woman's advice? And does she have what it takes to make a real, lasting change in the way we eat?</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/alevels\">A-level results</a> are being hit by sibling inflation as the number of photogenic twins gaining top grades and places at the same university rose again for the 17th year in a row.</p> <p>And 2008 saw the usual twins being trumped by the appearance of the Oke quadruplets - Tolu, Tayo, Tobi and Tosin \u2013 who achieved A and B grades at the St Francis Xavier sixth form college in Clapham, south-west London.</p> <p>The 18-year-olds from Woolwich secured places at Manchester, Goldsmiths, Queen Mary University of London and Cambridge. </p> <p>\"Our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning,\" said Tayo.</p> <p>Among students and their families celebrating A-level results across England, Wales and Northern Ireland were identical twins Anika and Nicola Ueckermann, who will study at the University of East Anglia following their crop of As and Bs from Colchester County high school for girls. </p> <p>Nicola said: \"We're not competitive and didn't mean to choose the same university. We just wanted to be close to home.\"</p> <p>They both rejected criticism that exams are becoming easier.<br>\"They are definitely not,\" said Anika. \"This year was really hard.\"</p> <p>An Afghan student who spoke little English three years ago scored four As in his A-levels today and secured himself a place at Somerville College, Oxford. Waheed Safi, 18, arrived in England from Pakistan three years ago, after his family was forced to flee their home nation.</p> <p>After his father fled the wrath of the previous regime his mother, Kubra, was left to bring up their children alone in Kabul and Waheed and his four brothers and sisters were schooled at home - taught Arabic, maths and the sciences, and a little English by a university tutor.</p> <p>Shayan Ahmed was celebrating today after achieving a C grade in his computing AS-level, at the age of ten. Shayan, from Walsall, West Midlands, has spent a year studying for the exam at Ryde Teaching Services in Bushey, Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Isabel Wilson, daughter of the late music mogul Tony Wilson, achieved four A grades to follow in his footsteps to Jesus College Cambridge. Isabel, a pupil at Withington high school for girls in Manchester, will be studying medicine.</p> <p>Twin brothers Josh and Sam Folkard, 18, of Chandler's Ford, Hampshire, said that brotherly love helped spur them both to success at Peter Symonds college, Winchester, and secure places at Oxford. \"It wasn't sibling rivalry between us, it was a more supportive thing, we helped each other out,\" said Josh.</p> <p>Louise and Sara Jones, 18-year old twins from Loughborough, were today celebrating eight As between them. The pupils at Loughborough high school are now off to their first choice universities with Sara studying classics at UCL and Louise reading Chinese at Edinburgh. </p> <p>Yet more twins, Annika and Helena Quinn, notched up A grades in a total of seven subjects at the Maynard School in Exeter, Devon. Helena will be going to Warwick University to study philosophy, politics and economics while her sister intends to apply for medical school for next year. </p> <h2>A royal flush (almost)</h2> <p>Princess Eugenie, daughter of the Duke of York and his former wife Sarah, has passed three A-levels, achieving the top grade in two of her subjects, Buckingham Palace said today.</p> <p>The Queen's 18-year-old granddaughter achieved A grades in art and English literature and a B in history of art at Marlborough College and is expected to take a gap year.<br> In Aspley, Nottingham, the area with the lowest percentage of people going into higher education, Dawn Whatman, 42, won a place at Nottingham Trent University on the basis of two A grades at A-level, despite having to hold down a full-time job and care for her sick parents.</p> <p>And the twins keep coming. Identical twins Bijal and Bindya Tailor, 18, are to study the same degree at the same university after achieving straight As in identical A-level subjects. They are going from Solihull sixth-form college to Aston University in Birmingham to study pharmacy.</p> <p>And seven-year-old twins Peter and Paula Imafidon, from Waltham Forest, London, both achieved D grades in their AS-level maths paper.</p> <p>\"They just like adding up and playing with numbers. It was not down to any pressure from their parents,\" said family spokesman Kizzi Nkwocha.</p> <p>Ekram Alam, from Enfield, Middlesex, gained three straight A grades and 100% in 10 of his modules despite coping with the illness of his mother and grandmother and the fatal stabbing of a friend last summer. He is going to University College London to study medicine. </p> <p>Matthew Lokes' award-winning invention won him an A grade in A-level design and technology.

  "<p>Gary Glitter, the convicted child molester and former glam rock star, will be deported back to Britain after his release from a Vietnamese prison next week, his lawyer said today.</p> <p>Glitter, whose real name is Paul Francis Gadd, was convicted of obscene acts with children in March 2006 and sentenced to three years in prison. The incidents involved two Vietnamese girls, aged 10 and 11, from the southern coastal city of Vung Tau.</p> <p>\"Police booked his ticket from Ho Chi Minh City to London and I have already paid for the ticket on his behalf,\" the lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, told the Associated Press by telephone.</p> <p>Last year, authorities cut three months from Glitter's three-year jail sentence for good behaviour. Glitter, who has served his term at Thu Duc prison in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City, will be released on Tuesday.</p> <p>Kinh said Glitter told him several months ago that he did not want to go back to Britain, but Vietnamese law requires it. In a recent interview with the Cong An Nhan Dan (People's Police) newspaper, Glitter said he intended to resume his singing career and may move to Singapore or Hong Kong.</p> <p>Glitter was convicted in Britain in 1999 of possessing child pornography and served half of a four-month jail term. Upon his release, he moved first to Cuba, then south-east Asia. He was expelled from Cambodia in 2002 over allegations of child sex abuse but was never charged.</p> <p>Glitter's defence team claimed he had been teaching English to the Vietnamese girls, known in court as D, aged 11 and Ng, aged 10. Three prosecution witnesses contradicted his story.</p> <p>Testifying for the prosecution were Hoang Thi Bong, 18, described by officials as a prostitute living with Glitter at the time of the assaults; Glitter's maid Nguyen Thi Anh; and Tran Thi Kim Oanh - D's aunt who, according to officials, took the girl 190 miles from her home in Can Tho province to have sex with Glitter. Ng, who is thought to have been pimped by one of her relatives, lives in Vung Tau.</p> <p>The court cited graphic testimony from the girls that Glitter had fondled and molested them repeatedly in his rented home and nearby hotels.</p> <p>Glitter hit his musical peak in the 1970s. His crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) is still played at many sporting events.</p>",
  "<p>Russian troops have reportedly begun pulling out of the key town of Gori in Georgia where their presence had threatened the ceasefire over South Ossetia, although Reuters is reporting that Russian tanks have entered the port town of <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/12/GEORGIA_map5.pdf \">Poti </a>(pdf) </p> <p><em>Scroll down and refresh for news, reaction, and your chance to comment and report updates</em></p> <p><strong>10.30am</strong></p> <p>Human Rights Watch provides the first independent confirmation that Georgian villages in South Ossetia have been looted and burned.</p> <blockquote> <p>In South Ossetia, Human Rights Watch researchers travelling on the evening of August 12 on the road from the town of Java to Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic Georgians. According to the few remaining local residents, South Ossetian militias that were moving along the road looted the Georgian villages and set them on fire. Human Rights Watch saw numerous vehicles carrying South Ossetian militia members, as well as Russian military transports moving in the direction of Tskhinvali.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>10.50am</strong></p> <p>Amid much discussion on the energy aspect of this crisis, <a href=\"http://\">Steven Pearlstein weighs in at the Washington Post</a>. He argues that one of the reasons behind Russia's incursion into Georgia is that the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline threatens Moscow's monopoly on energy supplies. </p> <blockquote> <p>...At the least we should be willing to deny Russian companies the right to raise capital on Western stock exchanges, extend their pipelines into Western markets or use their energy profits to buy up major Western companies.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11am</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://english.pravda.ru/world/ussr/14-08-2008/106095-War_South_Ossetia-0\">Russia expert, Marshall Goldman, makes the very same point on the Pravda website</a> - that Russia could not tolerate a pipeline that undermined its control of energy supplies to the west. Western Europe depends on Russia for 30% of its gas supplies.</p> <blockquote> <p>Georgia has built an oil and soon a gas pipeline which will carry oil and gas from Central Asia - this will end Russia's monopoly control over access to energy in Central Asia. This in itself makes Georgia a target for Russia. Russia, as the controller and protector of both Gazprom and Transneft could not tolerate this challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11.20am</strong></p> <p>The consensus among the commentariat is that Russia, particularly Vladimir Putin, has emerged as the clear victor in this short war in the Caucasus. But what about the long term? Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, was scathing about Russia's long-term prospects. Speaking on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/video/default.stm\">BBC Newsnight </a>- the video has yet to go up - Hunter dismissed talk of Russia as a resurgent power. It's Saudi Arabia with trees, he said, or words to that effect. He went to argue that in the long run, Russia will suffer as western companies will not be too keen to invest in such a volatile country. While Hunter's view is a useful corrective to the alarmist talk about Russia - and let's face it, it's still pretty enfeebled compared to the US - authoritarian countries do not seem to have much trouble attracting foreign investment. Just look at Russia's neighbour - China. </p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=359&amp;objectid=10526482&amp;pnum=2\">Gwynne Dyer is not getting too worked up about this short war in the Caucasus</a>. He thinks it's much ado about nothing as he makes clear in the New Zealand Herald.</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no great moral issue here. What Georgia tried to do to South Ossetia is precisely what Russia did to Chechnya, but Georgia wasn't strong enough and South Ossetia had a bigger friend. There is no great strategic issue either: apart from a few pipeline routes, the whole Transcaucasus is of little importance to the rest of the world. In six months' time, we probably won't even remember this foolish adventure. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>11.40am</strong></p> <p>Reuters is reporting that Russian soldiers have invited Georgian police to tour the strategic town of Gori - also the birthplace of Josef Stalin - abandoned by Georgia's army three days earlier as it retreated in the face of Moscow's advancing forces.</p> <p>\"Driving a black Mercedes car with a Georgian number plate, Russian commanders guided a Georgian police convoy into the centre of the town, which they promised to hand over within days,\" the report says. </p> <p><strong>12pm</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://cominf.org/english/\">South Ossetia's official website</a> is worth looking at, for the blood and thunder rhetoric alone.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong></p> <p>BP says it has resumed pumping gas into the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum pipeline in Georgia, the Associated Press reports. The British oil giant had stopped pumping gas into the pipeline on Tuesday because of security fears, but BP's Baku-Supsa oil pipeline - also shut down on Tuesday - remains closed. The larger Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan line remains out of action after a fire earlier this month on the Turkish section of the line. </p> <p><strong>12:40pm</strong></p> <p>At least five explosions have been heard near Gori, according to AP, suggesting the Russian troop withdrawal may have collapsed. While it was not immediately clear if the blasts were a renewal of fighting between Georgian and Russian forces, they sounded similar to mortar shells and occurred after a tense confrontation between Russian and Georgian troops on the edge of the city.</p> <p><strong>12:55pm </strong></p> <p>The UN estimates that 100,000 Georgians have been uprooted since hostilities broke out, while Russia says some 30,000 residents of South Ossetia fled to the neighbouring province of North Ossetia.</p> <p><strong>1:05pm</strong></p> <p>Rosa Brooks questions in her column in the LA Times just why Georgia was so sure the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-brooks14-2008aug14,0,4988958.column\">US would come to its aid</a>...</p> <p><strong>1:15pm</strong></p> <p>Provisions of the agreement reached by Georgia and Russia to end the fighting in Georgia have been released. The text below is according to the Kremlin.</p> <p>-- Do not resort to the use of force. </p> <p>-- The absolute cessation of all hostilities. </p> <p>-- Free access to humanitarian assistance. </p> <p>-- The armed forces of Georgia must withdraw to their permanent positions. </p> <p>-- The armed forces of the Russian Federation must withdraw to the line where they were stationed prior to the beginning of hostilities. Prior to the establishment of international mechanisms, the Russian peacekeeping forces will take additional security measures. </p> <p>-- An international debate on the future status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and ways to ensure their lasting security will take place. </p> <p><strong>1:25pm</strong></p> <p>Guardian correspondent Luke Harding, who is on the outskirts of Gori, reports that the Russian's are still occupying strategic points deep inside Georgia. You can listen to his audio report <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2008/aug/14/luke.harding.gori.georgia\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>1:40pm</strong></p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, who is enroute to Tbilisi via France, has said the violation of truce by Russian troops has ''only served to deepen the isolation into which Russia is moving''.</p> <p>There was, she said, a \"very strong, growing sense that Russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be... we expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia.\"</p> <p><strong>1:50pm </strong></p> <p>And to move away from the political developments for a moment, there is a nice <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24176280-5000117,00.html\">personal account on life in Georgia</a> in the Australian press. Tamara Steward writes in the Melbourne Herald Sun about how Georgia is her favourite place on earth - and that the hospitality is legendary.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong></p> <p>Further to the earlier referenced piece by Rosa Brooks in the LA Times on the role of the US in the current crisis, the Guardian's Seumas Milne writes about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia\">how the conflict is essentially about US expansion rather than Russian aggression.</a></p> <p><strong>2:15pm</strong></p> <p>Supplies have been sent to the conflict zone from the International Red Cross and the UN refugee agency, along with the World Food Programme. Two US aid flights have also arrived in Tbilisi carrying cots, blankets, medicine and surgical supplies.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/russia.georgia1\">Rachel Clogg has a very thoughtful and well-balanced piece</a> that steers away from the blame game. As she argues on the Guardian's Comment is Free, the problem is bigger than just Russia versus Georgia, it's how the world deals with that old question of self-determination.</p> <blockquote> <p>The lesson of this past week is surely that we ignore so-called dormant conflicts at our peril. This goes to the core of the problem, though - that there is a crisis in international systems for managing conflict, and building peace. The UN is paralysed by the veto powers of its permanent members and the world community does not know how to approach the issue of self-determination.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>2.45pm</strong></p> <p>Lativa, Estonia and Lithuania have been among the most ardent supporters of Georgia. <a href=\"http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/21104/\">The three Baltic states are nervous that they may be next</a>, not necessarily now, but 10 years from now, according to the Baltic Times website.</p> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong></p> <p>Anatol Lieven, a highly astute commentator on world affairs, has very little sympathy for Georgia and the Bush administration. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/95713d6c-6966-11dd-91bd-0000779fd18c.html\">He makes the point in a piece for the Financial Times</a> that the US financed and trained the Georgian military even after the Georgian government had said that these forces were intended for the recovery of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The west should demonstrate to Moscow its real will and ability to defend those east European countries that have already been admitted into Nato, and to which it is therefore legally and morally committed - especially the Baltic states. We should say this and mean it. Under no circumstances should we extend such guarantees to more countries that we do not intend to defend. To do so would be irresponsible, unethical and above all contemptible.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.15pm</strong></p> <p>Our thanks yet again to <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/08/13/georgia-russia-whats-next/\">Veronica Khokhlova at Global Voices</a> who provides a translation of <a href=\"http://www.cjes.ru/\">Oleg Panfilov's blog</a> from Tbilisi.</p> <blockquote> <p>If we analyse what's happened, we'll find many arguments both in favor of Georgia, and in favor of the imperial ways of today's Kremlin. One thing is clear, though - Georgia is not going to turn into a different country, it has tasted freedom in the past five years, has tasted democracy, despite the fact that many people do not like it. Now it's up to other remnants of the Soviet empire whether they are going to continue living the way they did or will learn from Georgia.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong></p> <p>The sniping between the Americans and the Russians continues, sometimes taking on a tone of squabbling children in the playground. This complaint is from one Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy head of Russia's general staff, at his daily briefing.</p> <p>\"We have information that American military-transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to Tbilisi airport, though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago. Let's ask them will they invite you (the media) to check whether it is humanitarian or not?... What is in it (the cargo) in reality? ... It is of major concern to Russians.\" </p> <p><strong>4pm</strong></p> <p>The Russia Today website reports that <a href=\"http://www.russiatoday.com/news/news/28945\">Russia has held a day of mourning</a> for those killed during the five days of fighting in South Ossetia.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"People from the capital Tskhinvali, which became a battlefield after being attacked by Georgia, are recovering from a nightmare. It's hard to find a citizen who hasn't lost a relative in the conflict.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We (my colleague Lee Glendinning stepped in while I was away) are winding down our live blog of the day's events.

  "<p>However churlish it might seem to say it, the revelation that little <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7556058.stm\">Lin Miaoke</a> was miming the solo at the Olympic games opening ceremony is the perfect metaphor for today's China: all cosmetics, masking deception. China's self-presentation is a continuous act of fraud, which matters because the victims of the fraud include the Chinese people themselves and the future. </p> <p>So well-known is this that I cannot imagine anyone is surprised to learn that Lin Miaoke was miming to the sweet tones of the even younger Yang Peiyi, deemed insufficiently pretty to take the stage. For this is just par for the Zhong Nan Hai course.</p> <p>Other elements of that deceptive moment at the opening ceremony might not have registered with the watching billions. The Chinese flag was carried to the squadron of goose-stepping soldiers by a large cohort of children, all dressed in the traditional costumes of the so-called \"minority peoples\" of the Chinese empire \u2013 the Zhuang, the Manchu, the Hui, the Miao, the Uighur, the Yi, the Tuja, the Mongols, the Tibetans, the Buyei, the Mosuo, the Naxi, and so on \u2013 there are 55 such groups recognised officially by the Chinese government, and a number more who claim ethnic difference from the Han Chinese but are not recognised.</p> <p>Almost all these people live in territories occupied by the Chinese empire. For that is what China is: it is as Europe would be if Napoleon or Hitler had won their respective wars of conquest and unified Europe under a single rule. Then imagine that the conquering nation had grown in population to be 90% of the continent's ethnicity, leaving the Czechs and Scots and Hungarians to be \"minority peoples\" obliged to attend national ceremonies in their quaint ethnic dress.</p> <p>Just to give a sense of what is involved here, let me relate an anecdote. While teaching at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing some years back, I was asked by the members of another department of the academy's Institute of Philosophy to give a lecture on \"the nature and origins of consciousness\".</p> <p>Rather bemusedly I said that I'd be happy to talk about the difficulties we face in understanding the nature of consciousness, but was not sure what could be said about its origins. And I asked them whether the origins of consciousness was a subject of research among them. Oh yes, they said; we take our clip-boards and visit minority peoples in the outlying areas of China, and we study them, because they have more primitive levels of consciousness than Han Chinese, so from them we can infer something about the evolution of consciousness among humans.</p> <p>Enough said. At the oasis of Turfan in the Taklamakan desert I once asked a Uighur for his view of Chinese rule over his region. After a significant pause he said, gesturing at the well next to which we stood: \"A Chinese will take the bucket from the well and put it down on the sand.\" Nothing could be worse for a desert-dweller than to have dirt introduced to well-water; the comment was intended as a sweeping metaphor.</p> <p>In fact neither of these tales is fair to the Chinese people themselves, but both speak volumes about official or governmental China. Here is a generalisation, to be tempered by remembering that people are much the same everywhere: the Chinese seem to me a good-hearted, hard-working, courageous, sentimental, humorous, vigorous, highly likeable people, and I have the deepest affection for many friends made in years of living and travelling there. Bureaucratic China, government China, is an utterly different matter. </p> <p>Because China is going to be a world superpower in a generation's time, it matters that China should rectify its horrible human rights record, give up its irredentism, think again about its forcible occupation of Tibet, Xinjiang, and the \"minority areas\" along the Vietnamese and Burmese borders, stop supporting hideous regimes like Sudan, Burma and Zimbabwe, and become a good neighbour to Japan and Taiwan, and a good world citizen generally. </p> <p>Only think: on most of the items just listed, the world's current sole superpower has never been wholly scrubbed-pink-perfect, and yet if you put a gun to most people's heads and forced them to choose between living in the US or almost anywhere outside the developed world, they would choose the US.</p> <p>If China becomes as the US is today in world-power terms \u2013 which it will: get the Mandarin textbooks out folks \u2013 yet keeps its current regime and outlook, US history will look like a legend of saints. That is why the pressure has to be kept up on China to reform its political institutions and human rights record \u2013 systematically one of the worst in the world: experto crede, I had years' worth of attendance at the UN Commission and Sub-Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, lobbying on China matters, and know the litany of charges by heart \u2013 because we or our children are going to be very influenced by decisions made in Beijing.</p> <p>What we do not want is an apparently sweet-faced Chinese government singing saccharine melodies while behind the scenes what is afoot is fraud.</p>",
  "<p><br>Russian troops have reportedly begun pulling out of the key town of Gori in Georgia where their presence had threatened the ceasefire over South Ossetia.</p> <p>Georgia's interior ministry said the Russians had also left Poti, a Black Sea port with an oil terminal vital to the country's fragile economy.</p> <p>Georgian police were halting civilian traffic on the outskirts of Gori this morning and scores of light vehicles were parked in the area carrying Georgian soldiers who said they were awaiting further orders.</p> <p>Witnesses said yesterday that irregular forces had joined up with the Russian army to loot and burn villages and kill civilians between the separatist region of South Ossetia and Gori. The claims of atrocities have not been verified.</p> <p>It was not clear this morning whether Moscow had withdrawn totally from Georgian territory. Both sides have signed a ceasefire requiring forces to return to the positions they held before the conflict started last week. But the truce allows Russian forces to take unspecified \"security measures\".</p> <p>The Kremlin could try to keep troops in Georgia proper while claiming to be protecting South Ossetia. Russian troops moved into the region six days ago after Georgia began a military operation to retake it from separatist control.</p> <p>Russia has rejected calls from the United States and Europe to preserve Georgia's territorial integrity. It argues South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another separatist region, were never part of an independent, post-Soviet Georgia.</p> <p>The US has begun sending humanitarian aid to Georgia, with the first shipment arriving escorted by troops last night. Supplies included cots, blankets and medicine for displaced civilians.</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, has warned the Kremlin to \"keep its word and act to end this crisis\". American military planes have begun delivering aid to Georgia, and the US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, is heading for Tbilisi after talks today in Paris with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>",

  "<p> Roddy's Doyle's The Commitments ... where the band novel made its first fully successful leap from pulp to literary fiction. Photograph: PR</p> <p>For some reason, 2008 is the year of the band novel. Completely independent of each other, writers including <a href=\"http://richardblandford.com/official/index.html\">myself</a>, <a href=\"http://drewgum.wordpress.com/\">Drew Gummerson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tobylitt.com/iplaythedrums.html\">Toby Litt</a>, and <a href=\"http://vulpeslibris.wordpress.com/2008/04/16/interview-with-doug-johnstone/\">Doug Johnstone</a> have all had novels published in the past few months whose stories centre on a rock band of some description. Why has this happened? Coincidence? Zeitgeist? Something more sinister involving group telepathy, mind control and the Illuminati? Who knows? </p> <p>This is not to say, of course, that the band novel is a new invention. It has quite a long history, going back as least as far as <a href=\"http://crawdaddy.wolfgangsvault.com/Article.aspx?id=3556\">Jenny Fabian's novel Groupie</a> (1969), in which the author presented a fictionalised version of her own experiences in the London music scene. In the 1970s, exploitation author <a href=\"http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jimthing/allen.htm\">Richard Allen</a>, of Skinhead and Suedehead fame, applied his sensationalist, ultra-violent narrative style to the rather incongruous subject of glam rock, in his appropriately titled novel, <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/115/298249300_f46c84abc4.jpg?v=0\">Glam</a>.</p> <p>It was in 1987, however, that the band novel made its first fully successful leap from pulp to literary fiction with Roddy Doyle's <a href=\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bkrev/doyle-90.php\">The Commitments</a>, about the rise and fall of an Irish soul group of that name. Here, an assured and accomplished writing style captured the vividly emotional experience of both listening to and making music. It was something of a breakthrough, perhaps anticipated by the essays of rock critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures.music\">Lester Bangs</a>.</p> <p>More band novels followed. Kevin Sampson found a home for several years' worth of rock'n'roll anecdotes, accumulated while managing the Farm, in Powder, while in 1999, Salman Rushdie created a magical realist alternate history of rock in The Ground Beneath Her Feet, in which Jesse, the still-born twin of Elvis, is alive and famous, Art Garfunkel's a woman, and U2 are good.</p> <p>So what attracts writers to the subject now? I asked Drew Gummerson what led him to write Me and Mickey James, a novel about a pop duo, one half of which is a hunchback with an attitude problem. He told me: \"I didn't start off thinking, 'I want to write a book about a band'. I had the idea of writing about a hunchback. He hates the way he looks. Put him in a band, I thought. Then people will always be looking at him.</p> <p>I quickly realised I could put [the band] into any situation because music opens doors. So they go off to Iraq to entertain the troops, they get employed on an ocean liner, do a stint at Ho Chi Minh's Rock City.\"</p> <p>As for me, my novel Flying Saucer Rock &amp; Roll features a band, following them from their teenage years into their mid-twenties, in part because I was interested in the group dynamics. Being in a band is like being in a gang when you're 12 - either you're a member or you're not. You can get chucked out and be replaced, which is quite an odd social situation to find yourself when in your early-twenties.</p> <p>The great thing about writing a band novel though, is that you can work in collaboration with the reader to actually make music. By giving the merest of details of what it is your band sounds like, you can set the reader's musical imagination going and have them soundtrack the book in their head. Each will hear a different song, unique to them. The writer will never get to hear it, but it's enough to know that it exists, if only within someone else's thoughts.</p>",
  "<p>I don't know how I missed the concept of \"enviro-crime\" until this week when I became a petty enviro-criminal myself. Franz Kafka, you never dreamed that garden hedges could get people into trouble, did you?</p> <p>I think my ignorance stems from the fact that the Daily Mail bangs on so much about council snoopers and spy-chips in wheelie bins that my eyes glaze over. Whenever I try to check out these stories, they're not quite right. </p> <p>One rough and ready guide is whether or not the other papers, radio and TV, carry these often terrifying reports. This week, for example, most papers have been running the draft - daft? - Home Office proposal to allow councils, health authorities and other public bodies to require access to our internet traffic. </p> <p>Not the content, but the who and when. Apparently, it arises from an EU directive (so the data can be shared with Bulgaria) number 2006/24/EC which was first floated after the 7/7 London bombs of 2005. </p> <p>It required members states to change their domestic law to ensure data retention by assorted providers for 12 months. Not for the first time we all have to wish that Osama bin Laden's father had been nicer to him.</p> <p>Obviously there are serious issues here: we all want bombers to be traced and caught; phone and email records helped catch the 7/7 chumps. But given the problems of securely retaining data 2006/24/EC raises troubling questions which are being teased out in public debate. </p> <p>Perhaps the Home Office doesn't really mean it and is making a daft overbid persuade us to settle gratefully for less.</p> <p>Public attitudes depend to some degree on confidence in the public authorities. Whenever the Mail gives prominence to some over-zealous council official persecuting an old lady who puts her waste in the wrong bin or the police prosecute the victim, not the perpetrator, we all get a little more irritated. It may not happen a lot, but it does happen too much.</p> <p>In our neighbourhood we now have to sort our waste into six basic categories - I think I've got that right - ranging from old-fashioned black bag waste to garden waste (a pink carton) and plastic (white carton) via bottles, tins and newspapers - the largest category in our house, which I bag up. </p> <p>It's time-consuming and I wonder sometimes if it's worth everyone's trouble, time and money. But we have a real problem with waste disposal in this country and need to get better regardless of global warming scenarios. At least I still get a weekly collection and live in a semi. </p> <p>For people on what Whitehall calls AWC (work that one out for yourself), who are seriously old or infirm, and live in flats the new fortnightly regime must be very hard. </p> <p>Government advice, when I read it, sounds sensible enough. Guidance must be clear, voters must be consulted and public concerns addressed. Storage should be secure, advice (on wrapping up rotten fish) must be available. All grand, but there's no guarantee in any walk of life that a system will be dickhead-free.</p> <p>Which brings me back to my enviro-crime. On Monday we had a postcard through the door from the local \"enviro-crime prevention service\". Under section 154 of the Highways Act of 1980 (vegetation which overhangs the public highway) we were apparently caught in possession of an \"overgrown hedge please\". The note was signed (\"sorry for the red pen\") and gave us seven days to remove said \"obstruction and potential hazard to other highway users\" - or else. </p> <p>What else? It didn't actually say. But I've read Kafka and the Mail long enough to get straight out there with the shears, trembling with a mixture of civic guilt and indignation. It happens that we had visitors we needed to impress (potential in-laws?) last weekend, so we'd tidied up. 48 hours earlier I had trimmed the hedge to stop the creeper trailing on the ground and attracting litter, lager cans etc, dropped by serious enviro-criminals who infest the neighbourhood.</p> <p>We're talking deciduous leaves and some Virginia creeper poking about nine inches over a five foot brick and lattice-topped wall here. We live on a busy B road, a bus route too, the pavement is 10 feet wide. It gets plenty of traffic, as does the road where single decker buses have lately been replaced by double-deckers which block the car-lined street - they're wider. They are usually much less than full. Irritating.</p> <p>Never mind. I trimmed back the delinquent hedge to two inches over the wall, to show willing. Will that be enough? We'll find out, won't we? But it niggled. We all encounter hedges which are dangerously unwieldy or sport nasty prickles (mine has one, but I keep it in order), but the seriously recidivist hedge on the side road round our corner is - I just checked - as luxuriant as ever. </p> <p>Of course, August is not the best month in which to give people seven days notice, so it may be in hand soon. But the biggest vegetation-delinquent is, I think, the council itself. It's me who trims the weeping whatever-it-is on the pavement outside to stop it hitting people in the face. </p> <p>The adjoining sycamore is now taller than a three storey house and blocks whatever morning light gets past from the ash across the street - planted there after a car fire destroyed the pretty little may tree. Ash is one of the faster growing forest trees. It's tall and ugly, it shouldn't be there.</p> <p>Does it matter? Not much. It isn't cancer, we're not starving or being invaded by Mr Putin. But it niggles and when the council wants to have the right to vet our email traffic we think of enviro-crimes and wonder if hedges will soon be given asbos.</p> <p>I'm now taking a few days off.</p>",
  "<p>Stuart Law last night launched an astonishing attack on Lancashire's decision not to offer a new contract to Dominic Cork, raising major questions about the captain's own future with the county. The 39-year-old Australian, who signed a one-year deal when he was appointed to succeed Mark Chilton last autumn, said he had not been consulted before the cricket committee made the decision to release Cork on Monday and left no doubts that he would have argued strongly for the former England all-rounder's retention.</p> <p>\"You'd think the captain would be involved in something like that, wouldn't you?\" he said. \"I've got to walk out with these players - the people sitting up there drinking gin and tonics don't have to. Yes, he's 37 but there's plenty of life in the old dog yet - at times of need you throw the ball to Dominic because he can make things happen. I'll probably get into a lot of trouble for what I've said but I'm just telling the truth - Dominic Cork is a quality performer.\"</p> <p>Asked about his own future, Law said he would like to stay for another year but conceded this outburst might affect his chances - which will not be helped by his continuing involvement with the rebel Indian Cricket League.</p> <p>Law was speaking after another poor display by Lancashire's top five on a pitch which he conceded was the best at Old Trafford this season. Matthew Hoggard and Adil Rashid bowled excellently, supported by Darren Gough's positive captaincy, to share six wickets after the match finally got under way four sessions late and Law won the toss. But too many of the batsmen gave away their wickets, including Law, who steered Tim Bresnan's loosener tamely to second slip to waste the platform he had laid after promoting himself to the problem position of No3.</p> <p>Law shared a second-wicket stand of 54 with Paul Horton until Gough's boldness in introducing Rashid's leg spin in only the 14th over quickly paid off as he trapped Horton lbw with a top-spinner. Lou Vincent's struggle to justify his employment as Lancashire's overseas player continued and Cork's first chance to prove a point ended with a heave at Rashid. Only Steven Croft, with a battling fifty, saved Lancashire from further embarrassment.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Russell will be here from 1.45am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.56am:</strong> Good morning everyone, and welcome to day six. Five days gone and what have we learned? That a diving pool is a tough place to learn about office politics; that Australian wit is a loosely defined quality when applied by sport officials; and that swimming records now have the lifespan of a mayfly.</p> <p>We return to the pool this morning, when the men's 100m freestyle world record will no doubt be lowered again, having already been broken twice in the semi-finals yesterday. Medals are also up for grabs in the men's 200m breastroke, women's 200m butterfly, women's 200m butterfly, and women's 4x200m freestyle. At the fencing, the women attempt to make a point or two in the sabre quarters and semis, with the finals later this morning. In gymnastics there'll be medals all around in the men's all around. In judo British hopes are with <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the men's -100kg, which will move through the preliminaries and repechage to the finals later this morning. Plus we have the women's skeet shooting final, as well as boxing, softball, volleyball and beach volleyball. Let the daze begin ...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.12am:</strong> Let's run our eye over some British interests for today. As well as <strong>Peter Cousins</strong> in the judo, veteran <strong>Mark Foster</strong> takes one almighty breath and dives into the 50m freestyle heats, while 400m gold medallist <strong>Rebecca Adlington</strong> returns to the Water Cube in the 800m freestyle heats. In badminton, <strong>Nathan Robertson</strong> and <strong>Gail Emms</strong> are in the mixed doubles quarter-finals.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.29am:</strong> Michael Phelps, who by now must surely have a full medal jacket in his wardrobe, isn't exactly prospecting for more gold today but the American is in action this morning in the 200m individual medley semi-finals.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3.01am:</strong> Let's go poolside now, where the men are emerging for the 200m breaststroke final. Japan's Kosuke Kitajima is the defending champion here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3.09am:</strong> No change at the top there, then. No world record either, but Kitajima defends his title in a time of 2min 7.64sec, holding off Australia's Brenton Rickard, in second, and France's Hugues Dubosq in third. Kitajima add the 200m title to his Beijing 100m gold as he successfully defends the two titles he won in Athens.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Sensation in the women's 100m freestyle semi-finals, where China's Pang Jiaying is disqualified for starting too early. Great Britain's <strong>Fran Halsall</strong> qualifies fourth fastest for the final. Pang won her semi-final in 53.49sec but was disqualified for flinching at the start.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Gregor Tait</strong> now lines up in lane 3 for his 200m backstroke semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> Tait finishes fourth in his semi, and qualifies sixth fastest for the final in 1.56.72.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.33am:</strong> But where's the green and gold?

Liu takes gold and breaks the world record in 2min 4.08sec.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.51am: </strong>Is it possible to set a blistering pace in a pool? If ever it was going to happen it's now, in the men's 100m freestyle final.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.56am:</strong> No record, but what a finish. <strong>Alain Bernard</strong>'s fingertip wins gold for France in 47.21sec, ahead of Australia's <strong>Eamon Sullivan</strong> - who still holds the world record in 47.05 - and the US's Jason Lezak. Bernard, whose shoulders must have their own postcode, then waves to the crowd who are all hooping and hollering like baseball sluggers at a Madonna concert.</p> <p>Read our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">full report</a> on this morning's exciting races</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4.15am:</strong> Ho-hum, Michael Phelps wins another race.

Seems the Croatians have grown the moustaches for the Olympics for good luck. \"Maybe it's working but it's too early to tell,\" said Igor Hinic after the team's win over Italy.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>5.11am: Oooh, that's got to hurt. Japan's Hiroyuki Tomita comes apart at the rings and crashes to the mat in a heap. Ice on the neck, pain on the face. But why did the judges feel the need to watch the replay over and over and over again before awarding their marks, one wonders?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>5.13am:</strong> Britain's <strong>Naomi Folkard</strong> is out of the women's archery after losing 106-97 to her Japanese opponent, Nami Hayakawa.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>5.23am: Mornin' all.</strong> Alan here. Russell's toddled off to scrape Olympic images from his retinas, and the cleaners have joined the team in the office. Stick with us for news on the ultra-stacked men's gymnasts; action from the beach volleyball (where, unlike <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">elsewhere</a>, there are never any empty seats); and British updates as and when they filter into the Guardian bunker.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>5.29am:</strong> By my reckoning, we've had four golds so far today, and there are another 13 in the offing. In the pool they've been going record-crazy, but all eyes have turned to the National Indoor Stadium, where the men's individual all-round event is taking place. <strong>Team GB's Daniel Keatings is currently languishing pretty far down</strong> - but he's only completed three disciplines, while most others are on four.</p> <!-- Block 24 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4m-_2fEp62s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/4m-_2fEp62s&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>5.35am:</strong> Brazil, as you might expect from a coast-heavy country, are beating the Greeks in the beach volleyball. Meanwhile, for those who might have doubts about the merits of watching blokes in, essentially, girls' smalls twirling and spinning for the judges' delight, feast your eyes on some of the above antics...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>5.42am: Team GB</strong> Gah! Our 'one to watch' for today, Peter Cousins, has been dumped out in the judo. Keatings, meanwhile, is looking pretty good on the floor, as far I can tell (basically he hasn't fallen over yet).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>5.46am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Matt 'Here's one I made earlier' Baker is all over the 'nastics, and apparently Keatings has his speciality to come - the pommel, if I heard correctly. Which is a kind of horse.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.49am:</strong> It's the USA... no, only kidding, it's China... leading, with Yang Wei apparently some way clear at the top. I know you're waiting to hear of spectacular, high-speed, mid-air balls-ups, though, so don't fear, I've got 'em peeled.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Emails from John Senior, Mark Webster and Al Parkes, re: Brazil's coastline. Apparently Greece has much more of it. \"If coastlines really were an indicator of beach volleyball prowess then Greece (13,676km) should be comfortably ahead of Brazil (7,491km).\" says Mark. \"Canada (202,080km) would of course be heading for gold, though I guess ambient temperature might be an additional factor.\" I'm not going to argue, but I was thinking Copacabana, sun-tanned Brazilians, and all that entails... rather than the British package holiday-infested Greek sands. Fair dos?</p> <p>Anyway, Brazil won.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>6.01am:</strong> News on the lookey-likey thread from yesterday. I'm not sure how best to illustrate this for people, but my colleague Patrick Whyte has forwarded on a suggestion from Andrew Jolly in Australia: Michael Phelps and Quark the Ferengi from Star Trek. Have they ever been seen in a room together?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>6.04am: Team GB gymnastics</strong> Keating is on the pommel horse, whirling madly...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> And the Beeb has gone to the news. Fandabydozy.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>6.08am:</strong> Keatings is in 17th after an \"excellent performance on the pommel horse\", according to Rishi Persad, but I can't relay his score. Probably wouldn't have meant much to you or I though, would it? Baker fancies the Russian, Khorokhordin. And I think he's pretty tasty too. But he's not going to win.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>6.14am: Coastline face-off:</strong> Austria (0km of coast) v Mexico (9,330km) up next in the beach volleyball. I know where my money is. And Indonesia, the world champions, are through in the mixed doubles badminton, soundly beating Thailand. <strong>They lie on the other side of the draw to Emms and Robertson</strong>, though.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>6.19am: Ancient Greek history class.</strong> Apparently gymnos is the Greek word for naked - which explains the vacuum-packed leotard arrangements. A gynasium was a place for exercising naked, rather than a place to go and smoke roll-ups behind, as is the modern meaning.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>6.24am: Team GB judo</strong> Michelle Rogers is taking on Jeong Gyeongmi of Korea, and it's 0-0. Apparently she went to the same school as Ryan Giggs.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>6.26am:</strong> Rogers has just conceded a 'koka' (complete guess), the smallest score available to competitors, apparently. GB 0-1 Korea</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.29am:</strong> British judo's Beijing suffocation continues, Rogers dumped out by the canny Korean. The smallest margin of defeat is still defeat, lest we forget.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> China may have 19 gold medals (it's looking like that will be 20 shortly, as the men's gymnastics draws to a close) already (and the US topped the table at Athens with only 16 more than that)... but such international point scoring shouldn't be paid heed to, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">reckons Andy Bull</a>. And if you'd like a comprehensive rundown of this morning's swimming, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Robert Kitson has the word</a>.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Closer to home, the Blackwall tunnel is looking a bit grim. You don't want to get caught in a snarl-up there, I can tell you. Olympic Breakfast with Sue and Hazel coming up...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.40am: China's Yang Wei takes gold in the men's all-round gymnastics</strong>, Japan finish with silver, while France nick a bronze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.46am: Team GB</strong> Weather in Beijing has come over all BST, and as well as providing a convenient cue for Chilesey on the Beeb's couch, it's also contributed to the sailing being delayed this morning. Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls, both leading their classes, will presumably get their booms back in order later on though.</p> <p><strong>In the boxing, we've got Blisterin' Billy Joe Saunders about to step out in the welterwight category.</strong> He's taking on Carlos Banteaux Suarez of Cuba - and the Cubans know how to produce a boxer, that's for sure: they won five golds in the ring four years ago.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.51am:</strong> Saunders bows to the four corners. The British southpaw is in blue, Banteaux red. Saunders is caught taking the fight to his opponent: CBS 4-1 BJS at the end of the first round.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.55am:</strong> The Caravan Kid, as I'm reliably informed Saunders is known, comes out swinging, but he has to beware Banteaux's counter-punching. Beautiful feint and he lands a left flush on the Cuban's chest. BJS pulls it back to 4-5 at the end of the second round.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Bit of handbags, the Cuban trying to hold Saunders and negate some of his energy. Banteaux is working cleverly on the inside, and despite his efforts BJS is unable to land more than one point in round three. 9-5 to CBS.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>7.02am: Saunders has to get his coat</strong>, after a bit of a schooling. Even when he was showboating, Banteaux landed the cleaner shots. Final second-round score, 13-6. Still, not a bad show from the Caravan Kid, who's only 18 and can look forward to going out in the semis at London 2012. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>7.08am: China have collected their third gold of the day</strong>, although admittedly it was about half an hour ago. Du Li blew away the opposition in the women's 50m rifle. Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic, the Games' <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2008-08/09/content_6920101.htm\">first gold medalist</a> came second, with Eglis Yaima Cruz of Cuba in third.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7.15am: Team GB</strong> Smiley, smiley Shirley Robertson is broadcasting from Qingdao, where the sailors are concerning themselves with knots of the rope variety as there's no action on the water. Which allows me to segue neatly into Al Parke's zinger: \"I just realised (helped by <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\">Wikipedia</a>), that Yngling is not a typo for \"Angling\". Angling did strike me as an odd Olympic sport. However, given that the games include something as bizarre as beach volleyball I thought nothing more of it.\" Al, if angling were an Olympic sport, <a href=\"http://sport.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,10593,-10704317004,00.html\">Bob Nudd</a> would have his tackle out there in a shot - and we'd all be talking about it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>7.24am:</strong> Canada are currently 1-0 up against the Americans in the women's softball. That'll smart, I imagine, if the Canucks win. Meanwhile, Robin Hazlehurst has written to express his concern about the nature of Du Li's victory: \"Blimey, have they changed the rules, I thought they were supposed to shoot at paper targets, not at each other.\" She metaphorically blew them away, Robin. It was basically a dressed-up lie.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>7.32am:</strong> We're currently in the fallow part of the morning, at least in terms of coverage on the gogglebox. Unless Steve Ovett has <em>actually</em> just won gold in the 800m. Apparently <strong>Team GB's Michelle Rogers, whom I castigated for defeat earlier, has made it into the judo repechage.</strong> So well done her.</p> <p>China are playing Poland over in the badminton mixed doubles. Not a cat-gut string between them currently.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>7.35am: Team GB boxing</strong> Tony Jeffries will go against Colombia's Eleider Alvarez in the light heavyweight class imminently.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.37am:</strong> Perfunctory boxing-into-the-camera from Jeffries. He received a bye in the first round, so this will be the first we've seen of him...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.41am:</strong> Jeffries executes a few punch, miss, cock-your-arm moves. Whether that threw the Colombian, I don't know - but neither manages to score. Appears Jeffries was denied a scoring shot by the judges, though. 0-0</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Couple of close-range rabbit punches to the head from the Brit, but he's having difficulty scoring even when he manages to pop his opponent cleanly. Hope this isn't going to go the way of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/12/olympicgames.boxing\">Joe Murray</a>. 2-1 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.48am:</strong> Battle proper is almost joined, but the fight continues to simmer. The Colombian keeps bringing down an overhand right which pulls him up score-wise - but the ref has warned Alvarez about ducking down. Solid jab to end the round from Jeffries. 4-3 to Jeffries</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.52am:</strong> Another good shot opens up a two point lead for Jeffries, but Alvarez is looking to finish strongly. He bangs Jeffries with an uppercut, and then takes one in the face which isn't scored for the GB boxer. Jeffries evades his opponent until the last 20sec when he pulls level... 5-5</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>7.53am: Tony Jeffries goes through</strong>, winning on the countback. He looked confident, but the fellas on the mics reckon it was mighty close.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.01am:</strong> The Chinese pair have beaten their Polish opposition in the badminton mixed doubles, 22-20, 23-21. <strong>Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson are up at around 2.15pm.</strong> And Kyle Hauptman has asked and answered his own question... \"The term 'the Mexican wave' has been on this blog a few times, instead of just 'the wave' as it is called in Canada, the US and some other places. Is there another kind of audience wave?\" Kyle enquired, only to follow up with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_wave#Global_broadcasts\">Wiki's answer</a> a moment later. Apparently it's less Mexican than we've been led to believe...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.08am:</strong> Anyway, there's only so much a box of Pro Plus and a plethora of Firefox windows can do for a man... I'm zonked. Howard Swains will be guiding you expertly through the tumult of 8-11 (and maybe a few minutes beyond). I'll leave you with <strong>Tony Jeffries wonderful Mackem brogue.</strong> He's pretty pleased to have beaten Alvarez a few minutes ago to reach the quarter-final. Shame his side will get a pummeling on Saturday when the Prem kicks off.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.13am:</strong> Morning all, and welcome to the hidden corner of Beijing known as Farringdon Road. Alan and Russell have successfully beaten off the email botherings of those in the southern hemisphere, which leaves me to deal with those early morning ramblings of anyone hauling themselves into the office in and around the GMT zone. Tell me what happened on the bus this morning by emailing here: <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>.</p> <p>Yesterday, having been thrown unawares into the minute-by-minute mix, each event was greeted on the television as something completely unexpected, and I rather enjoyed it. Today, I at least have some idea of what's coming up: we've got some <strong>baseball</strong>, <strong>softball</strong>, <strong>volleyball</strong>, <strong>handball</strong>, <strong>beach volleyball</strong>, <strong>water polo</strong>ball, <strong>boxing</strong>ball, <strong>judo</strong>ball, highball, lowball, stoolball, whiffleball, wallball and airflowball happening right now. </p> <p>I'd kind of been looking forward to watching Sunderland's Stadium of Light burger van proprietor <strong>Tony Jefferies</strong> taking his place in the Olympic ring, but it seems he's already boxed for the delectation of Alan Gardner, and won. See update at 7.53am. I guess all we can do is speculate on other unlikely professions for British Olympians or, indeed, Olympians from any other countries. I'd like to see a traffic warden in the dressage, or something like that.</p> <p>Still to come: <strong>table tennis</strong>, some <strong>canoe/kayaking</strong> and some <strong>sailing</strong>. Gold medal winners will be decided in the team <strong>dressage</strong>, <strong>judo</strong>, <strong>fencing</strong>, <strong>wrestling</strong> and some <strong>archery</strong>. Not sure if that will be on my watch or not, but you'll surely be here all day, right?</p> <p>In other non-Olympic competition, the battle is on to keep <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/09/london.greyhoundracing\">Walthamstow Greyhound Track open</a>, although I'm indifferent on that one. I spent a night there a year or so ago and got well and truly duffed up by the bookies and their porridge-laden mutts. </p> <p>I also have a telephone date this morning with the incompetents at Iberia airlines, who lost my bag on a flight back from South America on Monday and are yet to locate either it or my flat, I'm not sure which. My phone charger was in that bag, meaning it is now out of juice, as was some expensive(-ish) hair product, which I'm reluctant to replace unless I have to, since I didn't want to buy it in the first place, but have now grown quite reliant on. Oh, there's also a bunch of dirty laundry in there, which they can keep.</p> <p>So, feel free to send in any ideas of how I can get them to do the laundry and deliver the bag; your memories of Walthamstow dog track; suggestions for professions for Olympians; or, if you must, anything about the greatest sporting event in the world.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.15am:</strong> Get your ears around this: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/audio/2008/aug/14/mike.adamson.olympics.update\">Mike Adamson reports from Beijing in our daily audio update</a>. Today, Mike talks to Lord Coe, who reckons we should not be expecting too much from our athletes (conveniently), and also attends a tense media briefing with Chinese authorities. There's also a results update, plus a run-down of what to expect for the rest of the day and the weekend.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.22am:</strong> The main BBC coverage is showing Olympic Breakfast, with Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine interviewing Britain's most decorated <em>Commonwealth Games</em> athlete of all time, Karen Pickering. She keeps all her medals in a plastic bag, apparently, but hopefully not next to a radiator, where they'd likely melt. Meanwhile, Brazil's Washington Silva just won in the <strong>boxing</strong> ring against Samir Bastie, with Ireland's Kenny Egan up next, against the Turkish boxer with a spectacular name: Muzaffer.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.26am</strong>: A couple of nice left-hand jabs from Kenny Egan -- the European championship bronze medal winner -- gives him a 2-1 lead at the end of the first round. It's a game of \"physical chess\", we're told.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.29am:</strong> The Dubliner Egan takes a 5-1 lead after the Turk walks onto a couple more left-handers. The fighters end up sprawled, greco-wrestling style on the mat at one point, at which the referee laughs. They get up and continue their neat dance. Meanwhile, in the judo hall, Great Britain's Michelle Rogers has lost in the repecharge to a German judo player, which saves us the trouble of figuring out what would have happened if she'd won. A shot at the bronze medal, I think, but am not sure.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.33am:</strong> Kenny Egan has got this bout wrapped up now, knockout notwithstanding. The Dublin fighter takes a seven-point lead into the final round after outfoxing his Turkish opponent. One right hook, in particular, is a belter. He leads 9-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.38am: </strong>\"What's the deal with the Beijinger?\" harrumphs Kevin Mackenzie. \"So far, for me anyway, its made like the British Olympic team on the gold position on the podium, and appeared only the once.\" Not sure about that Kevin, I'll get the techies onto it. Meanwhile, let's spin your disgruntled email into an advert. The Beijinger is guardian.co.uk's daily email update from the Olympics. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/series/thebeijinger\">You can read previous dispatches, or sign up, by clicking this blue text</a>. As expected, Egan won that bout 10-2 and is now one fight away from a medal for Ireland in the light heavyweight (81kg) division).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> \"Speaking of the Commonwealth games,\" says Manoj G. Menon, from Mumbai, \"I notice that the top nations in those games are barely registering on the Olympics tally. Canada &amp; South Africa are noticeably absent so far. India is struggling with one gold. Australia and GB are not doing that spectacularly either. Is it because the standard in Commonwealth sport is so abysmally poor?\" At the risk of giving a one-word answer (which would be \"yes\"), it's more the case that the other non-Commonwealth countries are pretty good too, I suppose. The Aussies usually do a bit better in the pool, of course, which could also explain it.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.46am:</strong> A quick update from around the channels: the <strong>canoe/kayak</strong> competition, in which a bunch of speed freaks and/or wannabe astronauts career down white-water rapids in a holed-out lolly stick, has been delayed because of rain. Seems rather like postponing the dressage because of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWe8c5SbGY\">an infestation of horses</a> to me, but I don't make the rules. Also, the <strong>sailing</strong> has been cancelled today, because there's no wind. Jings. To compensate, \"Olympic Breakfast\" is showing a repeat of some archery, there's also some repeat of some gymnastics on an internet channel.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.51am:</strong> I think they call this a sloooow day, with news that the <strong>rowing</strong> has also now been postponed. That's rowing with oars, not arguing, which would make a fine Olympic sport. Thanks to Kate Bevis for this on the subject of the paid employment of Olympians: \"This morning Japanese TV treated us to a look at the office where yesterday's Japanese gold medalist (Ueno-san in the 70kg women's judo) works. I missed the start so I don't know what type of company it was, but it was very grey. They also showed us her desk which was described as \"very neat\" and sported a calendar with some arrows drawn on (training schedule?). Her co-worker then told us she \"helps to make databases\". She's only there until lunch though - after that she goes to the do-jo. In other exciting Japanese TV news, their 200m butterfly bronze medalist, Matsuda-san, started swimming in a greenhouse made from industrial strength clingfilm. The villagers put it up to cover the outdoor pool so the local children could practice in the winter. Even so the water temperature was only 10 degrees celcius.\"</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.58am</strong>: Italy has won a gold medal, thanks to Chiara Cainero, who is both skeet-shooting champion and a new model of 4WD SUV by the sounds of it. Cainero won a shoot-off against the American and German shooters.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.03am</strong>: There's really very little going on at the Games at the moment, so take a look back at what you've missed by clicking on any of the following:<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">Political controversy: Coe dismisses Britain's chances</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsboxing1\">Boxing: Billy Joe Saunders beaten by Cuban</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics5\">Swimming: Kitajima seals double breaststroke gold</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.13am: </strong>So, the weather is shocking in Beijing, bad enough to mean all the water-based sports (rowing and kayaking) are cancelled, but it's <em>not</em> bad enough to postpone the archery, in which competitors and thousands of spectators alike have been kitted out with the kind of ponchos given away beside the log flume at Alton Towers. These are presumably not arrow-proof, so let's hope the wind stays down.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am: </strong>This <strong>archery</strong> is riveting. The Korean archer Yun has just hit three nines (the outer gold), while the American Lorig got two eights (the inner red) and one nine. Yun leads after the first end. This is the semi-final, I think, although will confirm that as we go on.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.22am</strong> A relatively hopeless seven for Khaluna Lorig is followed by a ruthless ten from the Korean Ok-Hee Yun. Lorig responds with a ten, which puts the pressure back on Yun, and she can only manage an eight. Lorig then gets another eight and Yun a nine, so the Korean is leading 51-55 after six (out of 12) arrows.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.24am:</strong> The penultimate three-arrow end also goes to Yun, who pings a 9, a 10 and another 9. Lorig gets 8,8,10 and trails by six points with three arrows left. This one is done, pending disaster.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.26am:</strong> No surprises here as the favourite Ok-Hee Yun ousts the American Khaluna Lorig in what was actually the quarter-finals of the archery. In the final end, Lorig shoots 9,9,10, but leaves Yun only needing a five with her last arrow to win. She gets a 10, and takes her pink bow and fisherman's hat into the semi-final. It's hacking with rain, but the quality of the bow and arrow action defies the elements.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> Simon Thomas has an idea on how to boost the British medal haul at the Games (and to diminish the achievements of the half-men/half-fish): \"It seems to me that swimming has far too many medals,\" he says. \"If you check out the list of past winners of the 100m, 200m and 400m at freestyle, medley and butterfly, the same names come up again and again. Solution: get rid of the 200m in all events and the individual butterfly completely. And since we'll all have a bit more time on our hands, stick back in a non-swimming event that we are really good at - the 1km cycling. Then the world (well, my house) will be at peace again.\" It's an idea. Let's give him that.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.37am:</strong> David Brigden is one of several of you now writing in with other stuff, presumably to save yourself from more arrow-by-arrow archery coverage. And, you know what, he's got an idea as well: \"Today has been a general and memorable discourse about the usefulness of medals table.\" (<a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/why_medal_tables_have_nothing.html\">see Andy Bull's excellent blog on that very subject</a>) \"So in this theme my suggestion (and secret wish) for the whole world to really remember these game in the true Olympic spirit, and not for the number of gold medals, is that instead of the usual \"end of games\" show, all participants including all backroom people, organisers, etc from all of the competing countries gather together in one humongous CONGA and dance around the streets of Beijing.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.48am:</strong> Back to the archery arena, for my amusement if not necessarily yours. Interestingly, the competitors are summoned to the shooting line by what sounds like a car alarm going off, which also interrupts some dreadful national music, played for the crowd during the breaks. It reminds me of Eastern European turbo-folk, but has a more eastern flavour.<br>Anyway, once the shooting gets underway again, it's the quarter final between the Korean Kwon Un Sil and the 14-year-old Mexican sensation Marianna Avitia. Despite her tender years, Avitia is a dead eye with the bow and a real prospect for the future. In this, she's beaten 105-99 by the Korean, but I saw beware any teenager who can shoot an arrow. She's my early tip for gold in London in 2012.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>The next quarter final is between Nam Hagakawa, from Japan, and Park Sung-Hyu, of Korea, the defending Olympic champion. The Japanese archer manages a fairly tame three eights; the Korean gets 9-8-9 and leads by two after the first end.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.53am:</strong> Devastating arrows from Park and there's no answer to that. She gets a perfect three tens, which is better than the 8-9-10 of her Japanese opponent. To paraphrase Sid Waddell: \"There's only one word for that - magic archery.\"</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.56am:</strong> Hayakawa is feeling the full force of Park's superlative arrowwomanship here and can only manage 7-8-9 from her three arrows, while Park gets a 9-10-10. \"That's just the way she operates,\" gushes the commentator. Park leads by nine with three arrows left.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10am:</strong> Even though she hits only a seven on her second arrow, Park manages two tens with the others and goes through to the semis 112-103, which is the highest of all four qualifiers. There are two from South Korea, one from North Korea and one from China in the semis. Meanwhile, Neil Stainthorpe, from Austria (who are presumably rubbish at archery), has an idea about the medals table: \"Wouldn't it be an altogether fairer system to organise the medals table by awarding, say, 3 points for a gold, 2 for a silver and 1 for a bronze and then ranking countries according to the total number of points? Why should a country which has won one solitary gold medal and nothing else be placed above a country which has won, for example, 10 silver and 10 bronze medals?\" This has definitely been spoken about before, Neil, but am not sure why it was rejected. Some newspapers do this kind fo thing anyway, which further undermines the authority of an \"official\" table. How about alphabetical order, huh? The Austrians would be still be pipped by Australia, though.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.04am:</strong> William Fotheringham <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/five_factors_that_will_determi.html\">has been blogging about Great Britain's hopes in the velodrome</a>, and it's well worth a read - if you can tear yourself away from this archery. Richard Alderson has e-mailed on an almost similar subject: \"Remove Phelps from the equation and the Americans are having a shocker in this Olympics so far,\" Alderson says. \"Once all the boats and cycles come home over the weekend, it's not inconceivable that we might catch them.\" The problem is, we <em>can't</em> remove Phelps from the equation, because he's American and has now won 613 gold medals. It's like saying remove Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, and Chelsea would have won the league.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.10am:</strong> Matt Warner is in Belgium, but that doesn't appear to be his fault: \"I recently moved to the chips and, it would appear, rain capital of Europe - Brussels,\" he laments. \"At my work people are carrying on as if the Olympics isn't happening with nary a mention in the first week. Is this because the Belgians are poop at everything - or are they going to come into their own in the next few weeks?\" I don't really know about the Belgians, but your office doesn't sound too dissimilar to this one, to be honest. Despite our committed band of sport beavers, life continues largely untroubled by the Olympics at Guardian Towers. There's more talk about A Levels today than anything Olympic, even though that very same dead horse is flogged annually, rather than every four years, like this one.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.20am:</strong> Everyone's got an idea of how to make archery more exciting (which gratifies me in some way, even though it implicitly implies that my coverage is boring). John Senior reckons they should host it at the Lakeside or Circus Tavern: \"Archery would be so much more exciting if they had beer-bellied Cockneys shouting out the score like in darts. The Korean's perfect score would have caused much more excitement accompanied by a long drawn-out \"THIRRRR-TEEEEEEYY!\"\", while Gordon PITTENDRIGH (who writes his surname in capitals, as though shouting it at someone who continually mispronounces or misspells it), suggests going feral: \"The archery would be monumentally more interesting and exciting if all the competitors were deposited in a forest and the last three standing could then have a shoot off against each others for the medals. Remember the Olympic motto - highest, fastest, strongest and bloodiest.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.29am:</strong> Just in case you're baffled by all this, here's what's going on in the Olympics at the moment: hardly anything. The lightning, rain and (lack of) wind has put paid to the rowing, kayaking and sailing, while the only real action is the semi-finals of the women's archery and some basketball between Lithuania and Russia. Lithuania are three points up in the second period there. Charmian Owens, meanwhile, is disappointed by Seb Coe's view on the British track and field chances, which you can hear <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/14/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1\">in Mike Adamson's interview with Lord Seb</a>. \"Fair enough it is a concern that we are not medalling as we have done in the past at major championships, but we need to nurture the talent and develop our athletes' mental strength, which were I believe we lack,\" Charmian says. \"What will a statement coming from one of our Senior Olympic Official, do for team morale?\" Hear, hear. In brief: although Coe probably has a point, he probably shouldn't have said it.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.35am:</strong> Apart from the men's <strong>basketball</strong>, the Olympics this morning are all about heavily armed women. The <strong>skeet-shooters</strong> are now back at their shooting stations, where the commentary includes such gems as \"she unloads that spent cartridge and puts in another one\", while the dead-eye <strong>archers</strong> are doing their thing in the Beijing rain. It's the semi-finals there and I'll do some more arrow-by-arrow of the final, if no-one sees the sense to wrestle this keyboard out of my reach before then.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.43am:</strong> OK, we're down to the finals in the archery and there's a vaguely interesting political showdown for the bronze medal, where the North Korean Un Sil Kwon is up against the South Korean Ok Hee Yun. Presumably, Seoul and Pyongyang have ground to a halt. Can the spirit of competition for third place in an Olympic competition heal the divide. We'll see. They were 55 apiece after the first six.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.46am: </strong>In your face, Pyongyang! The South Korean Ok Hee-Yun proves that political liberation rather than nuclear oppression is the only real gateway to Olympic bronze, when she defeats Un Sil Kwon, from the North. The gold medal match to follow. David Lloyd (not that one, or that other one) is zinging this morning: \"With all this Asian domination of the archery one wonders why Kevin Costner never bothered entering for the USA.\" I get where this one is going. \"I remember seeing him in a film once about some blokes rushing around a forest with barely a gadget between them and he seemed to manage landing one pointed stick on top of another quite regularly. He even managed a few trick shots, eyes closed on horseback, from a flaming tree hut etc which if included would liven proceedings up considerably don't you think?\" Yes. Yes I do.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.50am:</strong> OK, China versus South Korea in this gold medal match, with Park Sung-Hyun representing the visitors and the vaguely Spanish-sounding Juan Juan Zhang up for the hosts. The Chinese nails a 10 on her first arrow, but lets her country, a billion viewers and herself down with a 7 on the next. Meanwhile, Park hits a 9 to start with, but goes into the lead with back-to-back 10s. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Still a two-point gap at the end of the second end, after Zhang gets three nines, and Park gets 8-8-10.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.57am:</strong> Great arrows from Zhang, who sends the home crowd delirious with a 10-9-10 to edge into the lead. Park only manages a 26 to the Chinese's 29.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>11am:</strong> Amazing stuff here in the <strong>archery</strong> arena, where Zhang Juan Juan needs to score a nine with her final arrow to win the event and break one of the longest-standing strangleholds in any Olympic competition. The Koreans have never lost in this, but they have now! because Park picks out the gold in the centre of the target and wins herself a shiny gold medal, 110-109. The South Koreans get silver and bronze, but China take their 21st gold of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Scott Murray has just shuffled into sight, and he'll be taking over here once he can find a chair, desk, television and computer. Such luxuries are by no means guaranteed when you sign up for a shift here. I'm not sure what he's going to write about to be honest: all we've got left is live basketball, a thriller between Lithuania and Russia (the Lithuanians lead 69-60 in the third quarter). Kevin McKenzie asks: \"For those of us reading your commentary on the fly at work and unable to watch on TV elsewhere, can you please explain what skeet shooting is?\" At the risk of providing another one word answer (which would be \"No\"), I'll try to describe what flashed up on the screen a few minutes ago, but which has since been replaced by judo repeats. It was kind of like clay-pigeon shooting in a rain and wind-swept heath somewhere, the likes of which I didn't know Beijing possessed. The shooters had some kind of shotgun thingy and were dressed in cagoules. Anyway, it's gone now, so let's pretend it never happened.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.16am:</strong> It's a rainy day, and we're cashing in all the pennies saved up for Scott Murray, who is now in the house. He'll be taking you through to the end of this basketball match between Russia and Lithuania, and will also have the pleasure of Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms in the badminton, coming up soon. Thanks for your emails, and keep them coming for Scott. He's going to need them.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.25am: <em>[MBM reporter sits down and begins to wing it, Barry Davies style]</em></strong> Morning everyone, to the Basketballing Jam Called Thursdays. Lithuania are five points ahead of Russia with two minutes to go. So are we all on the edge of our sea... ah. Minute-by-minute basketball, that it's come to this.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.29am:</strong> It's 84-79 to Lithuania with 31 seconds remaining. Am I actually writing this?</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.29am and 20 seconds:</strong> There are 11 seconds remaining, a man has blown a whistle, and now Lithuania take a free pop at goal, or whatever. They're now 86-79 ahead, a timeout has been called by the Russians, and my admiration for the improvisational skills of Barry Davies over the years has just multiplied by 374,958.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Peep peep peeeeeeep. That's it, Russia can't score at a rate of nearly a point a second to win - there's a surprise - and the Lithuanians prevail 86-79. They were \"consistent throughout the entire game in its entirety\", according to the commentator, which suggests basketball analysts are not much further advanced than their footballing counterparts. Lithuania top the group, while Russia, who have now lost three games, look a wee bit jiggered.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.35am:</strong> Hazel Irvine on the BBC has just had a wee bit of fun with Thai boxer Non Boonjumnong's monicker. Apparently it's a bit of a tongue-twister! Really, are we not over this style of light banter in 2008?</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.46am:</strong> The laugh really is on Boonjumnong now, though. One of the favourites for gold in the welterweight Belting Seven Bells Out Of Folk sport - he won silver at the world championships last year - Boonjumnong's just been slapped all round the ring by Egypt's Hosam Abdin in the round of 16. According to the points system, if I understand it correctly, which I don't, the Egyptian hit his opponent 11 times on the head, while only being smacked in the mouth ten times himself. That's quite an upset.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> Meanwhile, check out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/7724295\">this toaster</a>! Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian has thrown the mother, father and extended family of all hissy fits after only winning bronze in the 84kg greco-roman boo hoo hoo. It's all to do with \"politics\", according to Abrahamian, who flung his medal away with all the style of a toddler dropping his ice-cream on the pavement. It's not exactly Tommie Smith and John Carlos circa 1968, now is it.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>O yay, O yay, 12 o'clock and all's well!</strong> Well, all's sort of OK, passable, but let's not split hairs on another lovely day of sport. A lovely day which can only be further embellished by clicking on <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/14/bumbling_bowlers_scoffing_swim.html\">this link</a>, which will in turn lead you to further YouTube links of Michael Phelps cramming junk food into his gaping maw, some classic Olympic action from 1908 (yes), and <em>that</em> interview with hitherto unrecognised comedy genius Schteve McClaren of Holland. Oh, and the big badminton match is on in 15 minutes, so please hang around. <em>Please.</em></p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> Mark Foster, flag-carrying Mark Foster, the man who embodies Britain - old, knackered and way past its best - has been knocked out of the 50m freestyle heats. Aw. <strong>China Weather News, presented by saucy weathergirl Richard Greaves:</strong> \"Just got back from my 80-minute cab ride there-and-back trip to the Kayaking where I sat in the rain for two hours only to be told the race would be postponed. Can anyone explain how wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking?\" Wet it has to be to be too wet for kayaking? That sounds like a Bruce Forsyth catchphrase in the making.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept.</strong> \"Thanks for that link to the hissy fit,\" writes Steve Johnson, who I have to say seems very polite and well brought up. \"I have sympathy with the Swede though. I read the article only to find that 'Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian threw down his 84kg greco-roman bronze medal in protest'. I know these fellas should be pretty strong, but that's a bloody big medal to be lugging about.\" Ladies and gentlemen, remember the name, I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot more of him, put your hands together for Steve Johnson!</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.16pm:</strong> Don't worry, you're missing no Emms-Robertson action. They're waiting for some other match to finish before they can start. Which gives us time to consider that great big gurning greco-roman galoot again, in <strong>Smith &amp; Carlos It Ain't dept. pt. II:</strong> \"So, the Swedish wrestler is lamenting that 'it's all politics',\" writes Gary Naylor, cueing himself up for the punchline. \"At the Olympic Games? Who'd have thunk it?\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.20pm:</strong> Here's some risk-taking journalism for you: I'm off to suck down a cheroot, all the while hoping the Emms-Robertson stramash doesn't kick off before I get back. It's all OK, though: Tom Bryant is on hand to hold the fort should my little scheme somehow go cups up.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.26pm:</strong> As Scott poisons himself downstairs it appears his luck is out as Emms and Robertson are on the court and biffing the shuttle delicately back and forth between them and their opponents. They then manage to lose the serve at their first attempt. Good stuff.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.29pm:</strong> The Brits win a fantastic rally to take the scores to 2-2, prompting a clenched fist from Emms and some, \"I'm the man, me\"-style posturing from Robertson.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah that's better. Thanks Tom. And thank you to Camel cigarettes. The Koreans are 5-3 up now, the 19-year-old Lee delivering a couple of tasty smashes in a row.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Emms looks much the sharper of the British duo at the moment. Robertson slaps a hopeless smash into the net to fall behind 6-4, but Emms wallops two forehands past the Koreans to level the scores at 6-6.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>As Bruce Forsyth would say: How wet does it have to be to be too wet for kayaking, to be too wet for kayaking how wet does it have to be?</strong> \"I would think it more likely to be postponed due to possibility of lightning striking carbon fibre paddles,\" writes Claire Wright. \"I'd rather pull out than take a possible fry-up penalty! I think the fry-ups are better left to Mr Phelps.\"</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> The Koreans have romped into a 10-7 lead, but a Robertson smash from the back court sets up Emms to put the return away. And then Robertson flicks one to the far corner to make it 10-9. Great! Ah, hold on, now it's 11-9, and time for a breather. Puff puff drink drinkity drink puff towel towel puff.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> Just a fantastic rally from Robertson, who smashes then dinks, dinks then smashes, and finally smashes the cock straight into the chest of Lee YD. He then runs around fistpumping like a lunatic. Is there really any need? When he put away the final point in the last round to put the Chinese number-two seeds out, he started running around in circles, much like Ray Wilkins did when he scored for Manchester United in the 1983 FA Cup final against Brighton. He barely gave poor Emms a cursory hug. There are two of you competing here, Robertson. As a team, yes?</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.45pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson are 18-14 down. This set - is it called a set? - looks over for the British pair.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Hold on, it's a game, not a set. Emms and MeMeMe are four game points down, 20-16. But they save the first two. It's 20-18 and hot, hot, hot.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.50pm:</strong> At 20-19, Mr Me sees his serve sail straight back past his lugs, and that's the first game to the Korean pair. \"Prior to the Emms-Robertson match was a thrilling Korea v China men's singles, which may yet have a bearing on the current mixed doubles game,\" reports Ben Roome, doing my job for me. He goes on to relate what appears to be an old episode of Jeux Sans Fronti\u00e8res: \"It was full of controversy, mascots falling over and being unable to get up, and the Korean Lee Hyunil to come from behind in the first game despite a terrible umpiring reversal that can only be put down to local pressure to quieten the partisan crowd and crush his opponent in the second. Hyunil demonstrated genuine mental and physical class in his win and as a result you could see the whole Korean badminton camp was lifted by his heroics. Having seen their boy win, I think the Koreans will feed off that and beat the UK pair too.\"</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> Emms and Robertson have already let an early 2-0 lead slip in the second; they've got no answer to the much more mobile Koreans and are 5-2 down in the blink of an eye. British sport at its best!</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.54pm:</strong> Mr I.I.I.I.I.I.I.I. Robertson delivers a decent smash to win a point, flexes his muscles Andy Murray style for the cameras for 17 minutes, then hoicks his very next shot straight into the net. Great. Britain. \"Has 'Team GB' won anything today?\" asks Oliver Pattenden, who knows the answer to his own question, I've never been more sure of anything.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.56pm:</strong> A couple of decent points from the Brits. Emms leaves a cheeky dink from Lee HJ, and it's a good call because the cock sails just outside the line. They draw level 8-8 - and then go ahead in a game for the first time in the match! 9-8. I should be cynical about British chances more often. Actually no, I probably shouldn't.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Robertson attempts a dink over the net. The shuttle hits the cord and tips over, winning the point. Robertson struts around the court with his arms stretched out wide like Jesus. A Jesus who has just found the cure for cancer, fixed the hole in the ozone layer, and devised a macro-economic policy to eradicate the credit crunch. And yes, of course his very next smash pings into the net like a wet flannel. He's actually becoming increasingly entertaining, I'll give him that.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> The Koreans lead 13-11, Robertson finally finding his range and smashing down a beaut which the Koreans leave only for the perfect shot to find the back line. But Korea hit back immediately, then Emms hits two poor shots in a row - the first a simple smash into the net, the second a wayward swipe long and wide - and the Brits are 16-11 down and heading out.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.05pm:</strong> The Koreans are far too good. It's 18-11 and basically over. \"I do find the whole Team GB thing quite dispiriting,\" writes Chris Hatton. \"I enjoyed Euro 2008 much more because England didn't qualify - can we go for the same approach to London 2012 so we can actually enjoy sporting<br>excellence rather than being hammered relentlessly with the news that a<br>Team GB boxer has made it into the last 16?\" Sounds good to me. Chris Hatton is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care, by the way, so he knows what he's talking about. The mental equilibrium of the nation depends on our ability to heed what he's saying.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Reacting to a shuttle toppling off the net cord, Lee Yongdee clips an exquisite and frankly outrageous return to set up nine match points. The first is saved, but there's to be no berserk comeback, as the very next point sees the Korean pair clinch victory, two games to nil. Instructively, Robertson does not run off the court in a huge semi-circle whooping and hollering.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> \"In small parts we were great,\" says Robertson in the post-match interview. No you weren't.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.11pm:</strong> The BBC interview goon insensitively asks Emms if she is definitely going to retire. She starts to cry. The interview goon makes no attempt to fill in the dead air time, but in fairness does stops just short of repeatedly poking Emms in the shoulder and chanting the word \"LOSER\". He switches to Robertson, who makes a bid for Kenneth Tynan/Sex Pistols foul-mouthed legend, but his \"we just wanted to bloody win it\" sounds too much like Alan Partridge bemoaning \"Sunday, bloody Sunday\" to be thoroughly convincing.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.16pm:</strong> It's the 800m women's freestyle, featuring Becky Adlington in heat 4, and this is not a live transmission I'll be bound. Let's see what happens here, then.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> I wonder if Adlington, who is <em>miles</em> ahead in this heat, will break the Olympic record?</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> Yep. 8:18.06 is the fastest time in the world this year, the second fastest time in history, and an Olympic record. Gotta love Britain, right here! Emms and who in the what?</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> \"I didn't expect that, I'm really pleased about that,\" smiles Adlington, barely out of breath as she comes out of the pool. No swearing, you'll note. And therefore no opprobrium.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>Groundless Optimism with guardian.co.uk and Andrew Moore:</strong> \"The Olympics always get going slowly for Britain, because our stronger events are always in the second half of the games. If the London organisers have any say over which order the events are scheduled surely we should schedule our strongest event early so that we can get off to a flier and get people excited. It would be a disaster if the nation is sitting around in 4 years time, waiting for the swimming and greco-wrestling to finish before it can start flag-waving.\" You do realise the second half of the Games is basically the athletics, Peter? I'm only trying to manage expectations here.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> There's a bit of a lull now, which opens a lovely cigarette window for your honest hack. Just in case anything happens in the next few minutes, while I slope off to wheech down a fag, Tom Bryant is keeping an eye out. I'll be back very soon, probably to find Tom reporting on the biggest Olympic story to break since Ben Johnson was busted in 1988.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> <strong>BREAKING NEWS - massive drugs bust at Olym ...</strong> just kidding. In real news, British swimmer Gemma Spofforth has come in sixth in her 200m backstroke heat in 2:10.58, which probably won't be good enough for her to progress. \"That could have gone better,\" she says, unsurprisingly, before admitting that she was over-excited.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> \"This, for me, is probably the weaker of the 200m backstroke heats,\" says the man from the BBC as the swimmers sets off at a blistering world record pace, eventually finishing with Kirsty Coventry claiming an Olympic record of 2:06.76. That, right there, is incisive commentary.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> In the next heat, our very own Elizabeth Simmonds goes out as if she's got an outboard hidden under her cossie - the sort of pace at which you'd expect her to run out of steam, mid-length, and drown. Fortunately that doesn't happen and she touches home in first with a new British record of 2:08.66 and in second place for the semi-final. Spofforth has also crept in. Woo! for the Brits.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> And woo! for Tom Bryant. Thanks for that. And woo! for the Olympics, for suddenly nothing whatsoever is happening. Everyone's kicking back a while.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2pm:</strong> Hold on! Roger Federer is a set down to James Blake in the tennis. And it's 5-4 in the second set; Federer will be serving to keep his chance of gold alive.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>GOOD SUBSTANCE ABUSE JOKE:</strong> \"Glad to hear that for Becky Adlington, there was, as you say, 'no opprobrium',\" writes Al Parkes. \"The taking of any performance enhancing drugs is something we should all<br>condemn.\" Federer double faults to give Blake a window of opportunity; it's 15-30 in a game the Swiss has to win.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.04pm:</strong> Federer was 30-30 and on his second serve, but a brilliant serve-and-volley wins the point; one more and that's 5-5 in the second set of this quarter final.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.08pm:</strong> A scream of anguish from Federer at 30-30 as he overhits a forehand when it was certain he'd earn himself a break point. Blake serves out to go 6-5 up. Once again Federer must serve to stay in the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Two careless forehands from Blake at 0-15 and 15-30. Then Federer nearly smashes a sitter of a volley into the net, but lucks out as the ball pings off the cord and topples over into Blake's court. Federer goes on to hold his serve - without once getting a first serve in. It's going to a tiebreak.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.13pm:</strong> Blake is up in the tie-break, 4-1. Over at the light welterweight boxing, Britain's Bradley Saunders, to give him his full name, has been beaten 11 smacks upside the head to 7 punches in the mouth by Alexis Vastine of France.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> Federer is hanging by a thread. He's 5-2 down in the tie-break, and Blake has two serves to come.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.18pm:</strong> Blake pushes Federer to the back of the court with a series of ferocious forehands to give himself four match points. He only needs one: Blake is through to the semi-finals at the expense of the big man.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> It's the hockey! And Barry Davies! And where were the Germans? And frankly, who cares? Anyway, it's New Zealand v \"Great\" Britain in the women's tournament, and it's live, live, live. Both teams really need to win if they want any realistic hope of making the semi finals, so here goes.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Britain haven't shown much up front so far, until Danson goes, er, dancing through the Kiwi defence and would have got a strike on goal were it not for a team-mate getting in the road. That's a long corner, a set piece which, rather like the corner in British association football, is routinely wasted. Does anyone ever score from them?</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> They score from penalty corners, though. Gemma Flynn of New Zealand gets on the end of a routine and clips the ball into the goal from a sharp angle on the right. That's 1-0 to the Kiwis. This is a pretty appalling day for Britain, isn't it. But let's face it, roaring success would just make us feel uneasy. This is what we know, it feels safe like this.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>2.32pm:</strong> Here's a thing, though, this Danson looks some player. Whenever she gets the ball she invariably beats two or three opponents with a mazy dribble.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>2.33pm:</strong> And it's 1-1! Richardson and Wright combine well down the right, the latter crossing for Craddock who flicks on to Danson to guide a high ball home. That, ladies and gentlemen, is hockey.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Craddock twists and turns down the left and wins a penalty corner after... er... yes. The hooter goes, but there's still time to take the set piece - and Panter whacks it home for Britain! Unfortunately, she is judged to have swept the ball into the goal, which is apparently not cricket in hockey, so it's disallowed and the score remains 1-1 at half-time. Although the official Olympic on-screen graphic insists it is 2-1 to Britain. It is 1-1 though. Er. Barry Davies is frothing indignantly at the decision, his funk mothership sailing right into the hot, hot heat of the sun.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>2.53pm:</strong> And we're off again, after ten minutes of Equestrian Dressage which caused minor blood clots in both of your MBM reporter's eyes. And with half an hour to go, Britain win a penalty corner after a Kiwi attempts to juggle the ball out of the area with their knee, Ronaldinho style. Not that it matters, the subsequent set-piece being eventually hoofed away by the keeper. This is just turning into a kickabout.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>2.57pm:</strong> This is all Britain, is this. Craddock flicks the ball up on the left and hits a reverse pass into the area which Danson nearly guides home with the back of her stick. I have no idea whatsoever if any of that was legal but it sure looked skilful.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Cullen has just wheeched a penalty corner into the net for Britain with just under 20 minutes left on the clock. They're 2-1 up; to be honest I didn't see much difference with her strike and the disallowed one by Panter on the stroke (literally) of half time. Still, all good and well. \"Is this reality or are you trapped in some kind of OBOer's nightmare, where random sports hove into view then disappear again for no reason?\" asks Chris Hatton, who you may or may not recall is a Professor of Psychology, Health &amp; Social Care. \"The mention of Barry Davies was the clincher for me - surely he went over the Reichenbach Falls in a final struggle with John Motson some time ago?\" Oh it's reality alright, but by no means a nightmare. This hockey is fantastic, for example, and Nathan Robertson's preposterous antics were a strange joy to behold. Although during the Dressage the words \"class\" and \"war\" did keep scrolling across my line of sight, much like the end credits of Crossroads. Does that count as a nightmare, Professor Hatton?</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> Fifteen minutes to go. Team GB are still 2-1 up. Can we please hold onto <em>something</em> today?</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.08pm:</strong> Unlike Gerard Depardieu, Forgesson of New Zealand is given a green card.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> Cullen handles in the area, I think. Whatever she's done, she ain't done no good, for the New Zealand team are awarded a penalty corner. It's cleared, though the Kiwis are turning the screw. \"Worrying moments for Great Britain,\" says Barry Davies. Those five words may as well be recorded by the BBC and played on 24-hour loop for the entire duration of the athletics.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.16pm:</strong> Britain knock it around the back for a while. Barry Davies has got the regal funk on because Britain's play is \"difficult to describe as progressive\". There's little better on national television than Barry Davies in a self-righteous stew.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> With four minutes to go, Britain are awarded a penalty corner. It's wasted. But they pin New Zealand back in their own half for a couple of minutes. The clock is ticking.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.23pm:</strong> And that's it! Britain beat New Zealand 2-1, mainly down to Storry in the goal, who flung herself spectacularly at a penalty corner, a save I might not actually have described at the time. That keeps alive their outside chances of a place in the last four. So there's something to cheer about at the end of a dismal day at the Olympics for Team GB. Still, let's not be miserable about it, what did you expect? We're only Britain, after all.</p>"
