  "<p>Tony Scott's brash D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu proved that futurist sci-fi thrillers, however far-fetched and ridiculous, can still grip if they are thought through with reasonable rigour. Eagle Eye is a movie in this vein, with a strong conspiracy-paranoia angle, but its sheer silliness and dumbness are a drag. Shia LaBeouf plays Jerry, a young slacker whose high-achieving twin brother, employed in the military, has been killed in a car accident. A misjudged counter-insurgency attack in Afghanistan (based, I am chagrined to note, on faulty intelligence from \"the Brits\", so the whole thing is basically our fault) has resulted in anti-US terrorist attacks. Innocent Jerry is framed by unseen forces as a terrorist and he is forced to go on the run from the authorities, along with a terrified single mom played by Michelle Monaghan - the pair manipulated by a faceless figure with apparently limitless power to control all technology. The deafening crashing of cars, whose impacts are so frequent and persistent as to be a virtual drum-roll, becomes tiresome and there is an awful plot glitch when the sinister manipulating force has to be defied with impunity so that both LaBeouf and Monaghan can survive for the film's big finish. Some nonsense is fun, but this wears you down.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a demanding transition, calling for a readiness to accept immersion in an entirely new way of thinking. The players have had it easy by comparison. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabio-capello\">Fabio Capello</a> is the person who has really put everything at risk. The \u00a36m a year was undoubtedly a consideration, but he could have sniffed out lucrative wages in club football if, in his sixties, he had decided to settle for the comfort of familiarity.</p> <p>Capello has been ready for the battle, prepared to grapple with a foreign language when others would have relished the excuse to depend entirely on an interpreter, who inevitably keeps interrogators at one remove. The image the Italian projects is of an autocrat whose mastery of every football issue is beyond dispute. No manager, of course, has actually been flawless.</p> <p>Nor is Capello viewed everywhere as above reproach. Wrong-headed as it looked in the wake of a La Liga title, Real Madrid sacked him because his style of play was incompatible with the club's idealised sense of itself. Without that, the FA would have had to find compensation as well as the funds to cover the grandiose salary. As it is, the departing chief executive, Brian Barwick, can be proud that, after the ill-starred pursuit of Luiz Felipe Scolari, he placed the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england\">England</a> team in such strong hands.</p> <p>One of Capello's characteristics, it is now apparent, is a willingness to reconsider. There must be trial and error because he is not simply dealing with a new squad of Englishmen, but also encountering opponents who have a few wisps of mystery attached to them. There was nothing of that when he was going about his business in Serie A and had a complete appreciation of every person on the books of all rival clubs. In Spain, too, it cannot have been so hard to familiarise himself with the other teams in La Liga.</p> <p>Capello is to be applauded for the series of alterations he has made on the way to scooping all 12 points from the first four fixtures in Group Six and so making it feel that England are already on the verge of qualification for the 2010 World Cup. In some of these games he has been taken by surprise to a degree that would once have been unthinkable to him. No matter what videos and reports were scrutinised, Belarus remained a little alien.</p> <p>How well briefed can he truly have been, for instance, about the captain Alek-sandr Kulchy, who makes a living at the Russian club Rostov? The dossier cannot have predicted that he would have been so influential that England's team had to be reshaped at the interval. Steven Gerrard, detailed to stay in the centre and push up on the holding midfielder, then shut off the valve through which Belarus's play had been flowing.</p> <p>The rethink has been the key tool for Capello. Andorra were holding England until Stewart Downing was removed, with his replacement, Joe Cole, bagging two goals. There was no breakthrough against Kazakhstan either before Shaun Wright-Phillips came on as part of the switch to 4-4-2. Capello is to be congratulated in all of this. Not even this celebrated manager can be in the right on every occasion and problem-solving of this precision is rare.</p> <p>It is tough for Capello to be sure of the wisest policy. When people, for instance, complain about the occasional misuse of Wayne Rooney on the left they are prone to making the ludicrous assumption that neither the England manager nor Sir Alex Ferguson have noticed he is better in the vicinity of a centre-forward. They are profoundly conscious of that, but have other topics to address as well.</p> <p>When England accommodate Rooney as one of the strikers in a 4-4-2 they risk being outnumbered in midfield. If he is, instead, on the flank in a nominal 4-3-3 he and the player on the right can both shuttle back so England, if need be, get 10 men behind the ball. Various benefits have to be calculated. For the time being, Rooney, with five goals in three England matches, is doing so much harm to the opposition that it is essential to let him stay near to Emile Heskey.</p> <p>A different verdict will be reached on days when circumstances alter, as they are bound to. In the most important aspects Capello is not dogmatic at all. He changed his mind about Heskey, whose worth for his country had really been appreciated by Steve McClaren, even if he got few plaudits for the astuteness since his line-up could not reach Euro 2008.</p> <p>Capello has been doing wonderful work. Alluding to his background in club management, he spoke of the switch from operating with footballers he might have known for 10 years to training an England squad in 10-day bursts. In defiance of the restrictions, he seems to be engendering confidence and a hard-nosed commitment to victory. The Italian is warming, in addition, to people like Gerrard, who deplored his own England form ahead of the Belarus match. \"You need players with humility,\" he said. \"It is about respect for other players, for managers.\"</p> <p>All of England's improvement has come in the midst of experimentation. There should be even better times to come when Capello can open with a line-up that has absolutely no need of further tweaking.</p>",
  "<p>For a generation now, the received wisdom has been: \"Market good, state bad.\" But how do we square this equation with the collapse of the market economy and the idea that only the state can bail it out?</p> <p>For those of us concerned with the public sector, these issues are raised with particular intensity. Where does this leave the market-driven values we've been taught to internalise? What will it mean for public policy and the public service ethic? </p> <p>From Thatcher onwards, we have been told how hopeless public welfare is and how damaging state intervention has been. Welfare claimants have been held up as figures to despise and suspect. The state has been cast as wasteful, bureaucratic, inefficient and dependency-creating. Welfare claimants have been stereotyped as draining the wealth which the market has generated, their dependency presented as a burden on the rest of us through their cost in high taxation. </p> <p>Where once we heard that the welfare state would put an end to social evils, more recently we have been encouraged to believe that it's the cause of social breakdown, and \"benefit scroungers.\" The market and the private sector, we are told, alone have the competence, expertise and experience to provide efficient goods and services. They can convert us from clients and claimants patronised by the state to public consumers with choice and control. </p> <p>Yet now, without apparent embarrassment or hesitation, state intervention is advanced as all that stands between us and economic meltdown. </p> <p>The banks, we are told, so distrust each other that only unprecedented injections of state money may make it possible for them to do business together again. For years the Daily Mail and the Sun have run poisonous campaigns against asylum seekers and people on income support to reclaim an imagined few millions. Governments promote campaigns to snoop on welfare claimants. These campaigns rarely generate enough money even to pay for themselves. Yet now we are encouraged to spend hundreds of billions of public money to bail out the banks and private sector that preached the mantra of independence and individual responsibility.</p> <p>Are we really going to pretend that all this hasn't happened, carrying on as before as if the market hasn't now faced its equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall? Will we still be looking to bright young management consultants at \u00a31,000 plus a day, few of whom have even run a corner shop, to teach central government, local authorities and primary care trusts to be 'business-like'?</p> <p>What about the big voluntary organisations who tell us they must pay their chief executives the salary packages of the private sector if they are to get the brightest and the best? Many such charities have increasingly divested themselves of services as their metropolitan offices and fundraising departments have got larger and glitzier.</p> <p>What will go into the large organisational hole now filled with the \"visioning\", team-bonding babble lapped up from the commercial sector? This is the same private sector that has now for years been featherbedded by profit-taking from public utilities, government sell-offs, wasteful PFI schemes and government tax credit subsidies for low wages, operating within a globalised economy that exploits the majority world and its people and damages the environment.</p> <p>From Enron onwards, we have all known that the private sector bore no relation to the lean and efficient paragon we were told it was. No one's saying the private sector is all bad, just that it has been grossly oversold. Meanwhile the merits of public service values have been treated as, at best, worthy but dull. The current economic crisis should remind us of what we can gain from enduring values of collectivity and mutuality. Our energies must now be spent on updating them to match the challenges of the future.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Beresford is professor of social policy at Brunel University</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to celebrity endorsements in the US presidential race, there are very few surprises. The Cameron Conservative makeover hasn't really crossed the oceans yet and so the dichotomy in Hollywood is still: left wing = everyone cool and famous and pretty and rich; right wing = Jon Voight, guns aloft.</p> <p>But sometimes, a show of solidarity comes out of leftfield that makes you re-evaluate the way we take celebrities for granted. To mark (not celebrate - this column remains defiantly non-partisan, despite being smuggled inside the Liberal Media Elite. We're bringing down from within) Obama's increasingly likely success, this week we look at the celebrities who made this possible. Oprah Schmoprah - this is all about the real powers behind the throne.</p> <p>We haven't spoken about Roseanne Barr's blog, <a href=\"http://www.roseanneworld.com\">roseanneworld.com</a>, on this page before because it would involve looking at it and, frankly, that Botoxed expression of perma surprise that greets one on the opener exacerbates the night traumas. But in the name of journalism I suffer. </p> <p>Now, you might think that a woman who headlined a blog last June with the piercing insight \"Obama's a douchebag\" could not be relied upon for support. But showing the fluidity of opinion that has made Barr such a fount of self-knowledge throughout her career, by August that tune changed. \"Obama seemed manly\", announced the exciting heading: \"Once I saw mr obama wearin' a cowboy hat, I went shit-howdy mad for tha' brotha'!\" </p> <p>It's the ghetto speak that adds a special kind of credence, don't you think? The new Maureen Dowd concludes her musings with the advice, \"He needs to listen to me though and do that hillary thing.\" And what would that be, Rosie? Lose? Ahh, it's maverick advice like that that keeps Karl Rove on his toes.</p> <p>But don't underestimate the importance of lust here. This brings us to our next illustrious supporter. Come on down, pink pantsuit freshly tumble-dried, the glorious Betty White! You know - the one who played Rose on Golden Girls which, for those unfortunate enough to have been born after 1988 was the obvious (if slightly more elderly) template for Sex and the City: there was the dumb one (Rose/Charlotte), the overly sexed one (Blanche/Samantha), the bossy-yet-wise one (Sophia/Miranda) and the one that some claimed looked like a man (Dorothy/Carrie). </p> <p>Betty turned up on the talkshow circuit this week for some reason and threw her fabulous tuppence into the pot. \"That is one hot piece of man!\" cried Betty, a bouncy vision of pastel pink. \"If Barack Obama needs more experience, I could give it to him.\" If you thought the episode of Golden Girls in which the ladies buy condoms for their upcoming cruise could not be bettered, watch Betty's solemn expression as she informs the nation that Sarah Palin \"is one crazy bitch\". Oh Betty, thank you for being a friend.</p> <p>But the number one supporter is Levi Johnston, aka Bristol Palin's babydaddy, who managed to break free from his chains long enough to give a few quotes this week before the muzzle was clamped back on. Aside from voicing his feelings about the Republican convention (\"I was like, 'whatever'\") and his decision to have his wedding ring tattooed instead of the more traditional jewellery method, he propounded his view on Obama. </p> <p>Showing his suitability to be part of the Palin dynasty, he prefaced his opinion with an admission of ignorance before barrelling on in there: \"I don't know anything about him. He seems like a good guy. I like him.\" And then, as certain shadows may have appeared behind him, he swiftly added that he hopes Palin (McCain notably absent from the endorsement) wins. But why, Levi, why? \"She's my future mother-in-law.\" Now go make a rap outta that one, will.i.am.</p>",
  "<p>House of Fraser, which is part-owned by the troubled retail investor Baugur, insisted yesterday that it was not short of funds and said it would consider buying Baugur's stake if the Icelandic firm's shares were put up for sale.</p> <p>Baugur owns 35% of the retail chain, which has 65 stores and more than 8,000 staff. The retail specialist had used loans from the collapsed bank Kaupthing to buy the stake.</p> <p>In recent days there has been speculation that some of the stores in the Baugur/Kaupthing empire are experiencing increasing financial pressure. </p> <p>Last week the All Saints fashion chain, which has 70 stores and 465 staff, and is also part of the Baugur empire, temporarily lost its revolving credit facility and had to scramble to get its credit line restored.</p> <p>But House of Fraser is, according to its own statement, in good financial shape.

Our responsibility is to the long-term future of the business and our employees, and we will always act in their best interest.\"</p> <p>The company's comments came just a day after Mosaic, the group behind Oasis, Karen Millen, Warehouse, Principles and Coast, which is owned 49% by Baugur and 20% by Kaupthing's private equity division, issued a similar statement. Its chief executive, Derek Lovelock, said Mosaic did not \"require saving\". </p> <p>The Mosaic group runs more than 2,000 shops and employs 13,000 staff.</p> <p>The private equity investor John Moulton, of Alchemy Partners, has contacted both Mosaic and House of Fraser to express interest in buying them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Sir Philip Green is still trying to acquire Baugur's debt, which could in effect give him control of the entire Baugur empire - which also includes Whistles, Jane Norman, the Iceland supermarket group, Hamleys, Wyevale Garden Centres, Goldsmiths, Mappin &amp; Webb, and Aurum.

  "<p>It was to have been her daughter's wedding day and Barbara del Arbol and her husband had flown out from Manchester to Toronto for the occasion. However, shortly before the ceremony the bride was taken seriously ill and spent the big day undergoing surgery in hospital. The Del Arbols contacted the travel company, Canadian Affair, through which they had bought the flights and explained that as they needed to remain at their daughter's bedside, they would not be able to use their return tickets as planned. </p> <p>The seats were non refundable, but Del Arbol suggested that under the circumstances the taxes might be reimbursed. This, she was told, was impossible, even though the tickets were resold. </p> <p>\"Am I correct in thinking that they are legally obliged to refund these?\" she asks. </p> <p>In fact, there is no law requiring airlines to return government and airport levies on unused tickets. Many will do so, but only when the customer gets round to reminding them. Happily, Canadian Affair recollects that it does honour written requests, although Del Arbol, having emailed, was told in writing that it does not. It apologises for any miscommunication and has now authorised a refund. </p> <p>Chris Kerr was also left with unused tickets.

  "<p>A Spanish judge yesterday ordered the grave of poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca dug up as, for the first time, the repression unleashed by the dictator General Francisco Franco was formally declared a crime against humanity.</p> <p>In a controversial reversal of Spain's traditional refusal to seek out those responsible for the killings of Lorca and more than 100,000 other people, Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n also asked investigators to provide him with information on Franco's chief henchmen and generals. Franco and his chief collaborators, Garz\u00f3n said, had been responsible for \"mass killings, torture and the systematic, general and illegal detentions of political opponents\".</p> <p>Death squads, military courts and other tribunals sent 114,000 people to their deaths during and after a three-year civil war in the 1930s that traumatised Spain for generations, according to the judge.</p> <p>Several thousand lie in unmarked mass graves, despite the attempts of volunteers over the past eight years to disinter corpses and hand them over to relatives for reburial. The judge ordered the digging up of 19 such graves, including one on a hillside overlooking the southern city of Granada where Lorca is thought to have been shot in 1936. Lorca's family do not want the poet exhumed, but recently promised not to oppose a petition from relatives of two men shot and buried alongside him for the grave to be dug up.</p> <p>\"I'm very pleased. I've been waiting 10 years for this,\" said the granddaughter of one of them, Nieves Galindo.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n requested formal proof that 35 generals and Francoist ministers are no longer alive. He also ordered the interior ministry to provide a list of those in charge of the pro-Francoist Falange movement up until 1951. It is doubtful, however, that any are still alive.</p> <p>The judge explicitly said that his investigations included repression carried out until 1952, 13 years after Franco had won the civil war and established his dictatorship. Many Spaniards still find the period hard to talk about and some fear Garz\u00f3n's investigation will reopen old wounds.</p> <p>The right has been critical of the judge and of a recent \"historical memory\" law to help Franco's victims passed by the Socialist government of the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.</p> <p>An unwritten \"pact of forgetting\" underpinned Spain's rapid transition to democracy after Franco's death in 1975.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n's critics claim that all civil war and Francoist repression is covered by a 1977 amnesty law and by rules which mean that most crimes lapse after 20 years. Garz\u00f3n declared yesterday, however, that where a victim's body had not been found a crime of kidnapping was still being committed and had not lapsed.</p> <p>The attorney general's office, which has opposed the judge's investigation, is expected to appeal against the decision. It argues that international human rights laws do not apply to the civil war as Spain was not signed up to them at the time.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has previously investigated repression by military regimes in Latin America in the 1970s. In 1998 he ordered the arrest of General Augusto Pinochet of Chile while he was in London but failed to get him extradited to face trial in Spain. </p> <p>Spanish courts have been criticised for investigating crimes committed by other dictatorships without ever looking at those carried out under Franco.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008.

  "<p>The immediate problem with <strong>One Planet: Space Junk</strong> (World Service) was one of scale.

  "<p>Your article (Sleepless in SW1, G2, October 14) raised concerns about the quality of decision-making by sleep-deprived politicians, a particularly worrying phenomenon in these times of crisis when we need to trust our leaders to think creatively and beware of risk.</p> <p>Your article finds that many people in power treat sleep as a frivolous activity. Perhaps this explains why the UK government has opted out of the EU's working time directive for so long.</p> <p>Yet this is a valuable piece of health and safety legislation, not only because it limits average working hours over a certain period, but it also ensures recovery periods after disrupted working hours, ie those which are exceptionally long or where rest is interrupted, as in the case of doctors or other on-call workers. Tired workers, like politicians, are potentially a danger to themselves and others, and are less productive. They can also suffer personally as a result of their poor work...#8209;life balance.</p> <p>The government advocates the idea of the knowledge economy, which implies the need for a capable and creative workforce, yet it is still pushing to maintain the British opt-out from the working time directive.

I wonder when I will start to welcome this sort of attention. That moment, if it comes, will probably be when I find it too exhausting to stand, or when people start to call me \"dear\" or \"sweetie\". For there is evidence that such belittling talk saps the morale of the elderly and makes them feeble and submissive.</p> <p>According to research published in America, \"elderspeak\", as the practice of addressing old people as babies is known, \"begins a negative downward spiral for older persons, who react with decreased self-esteem, depression, withdrawal and the assumption of dependent behaviours\". One survey carried out in a small town in Ohio found that people over 50 who managed to retain a positive attitude to ageing lived on average seven and a half years longer than others, more than if they didn't smoke or took lots of exercise. In a nursing home for people with moderate dementia, it was noted that patients tended to scream and become aggressive if staff used phrases such as \"good girl\", or asked them sweetly how they were feeling.</p> <p>The British government is launching a major review of legislation to protect the elderly from abuse, but naturally this won't cover undermining them with baby talk. This is something the elderly must try to combat on their own. One method, recommended by a 68-year-old woman in California, a police psychologist, is to sprinkle one's conversation with profanities. \"That makes people think, 'This is someone to be reckoned with,'\" she claims. </p> <p><strong>The wretched Bush presidency is</strong> <strong>appropriately</strong> ending its days with a flurry of fresh controversy about the death penalty, a punishment for which Bush has always shown a creepy degree of enthusiasm. Two new cases illustrate again how ghoulish and judicially flawed death sentences in America can be.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Richard Cooey, 41, who had spent more than 20 years on death row, was executed in Ohio after the supreme court rejected his plea that he was too obese (at more than 19 stone) to be painlessly put to death by lethal injection. The court accepted the assurance of prison staff that his arms had accessible veins to which poisons could be administered without subjecting him to \"cruel and unusual punishment\". On Wednesday, the same court, in effect, gave the go-ahead for another execution when it refused to hear an appeal by Troy Davis, a 40-year-old Georgia man, after seven of nine witnesses who helped to convict him in 1991 of killing a police officer had subsequently recanted their testimony or changed their statements. </p> <p>The Pope, Jimmy Carter, Amnesty International and the Council of Europe were among those who had begged that he be spared, but it now seems certain that Davis will die. America's dogged attachment to the death penalty in even the most dubious of circumstances is a hideous blot on its reputation for fairness and humanity that, alas, even Barack Obama has no plans to eradicate. </p> <p><strong>By forcefully dissociating himself from Bush in his final </strong>debate with Obama, John McCain once again laid claim to being a maverick, a term his running mate Sarah Palin also claims for herself whenever she gets the chance. But what exactly is a maverick? I first heard the word when I was four years old on a 78rpm record of the opening number of the then new Broadway musical Oklahoma!, Oh What a Beautiful Morning. It comes in the second verse:</p> <p>All the cattle are standin' like statues,</p> <p>All the cattle are standin' like statues,</p> <p>They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by,</p> <p>But a little brown mav'rick is winkin' her eye.</p> <p>Only years later did I learn that a maverick is a term applied by Texas cowboys to any unbranded calf found wandering about in the wild. It comes from Samuel A Maverick, a 19th-century Texan politician and rancher, who upset his neighbours by refusing to brand his cattle on the grounds that it was cruel. Later the word came to mean a person who could not be trusted to be loyal to his group, though I'm not sure whether this referred to Maverick or his calves. In any case, as applied to people rather than cows, maverick started off as a term of disparagement before becoming what McCain and Palin regard as a badge of honour, signifying a gutsy free spirit. </p> <p>I continue to be puzzled, however, by the fact that the maverick in Oklahoma! is \"winking her eye\", for I have never seen a cow wink and am not even persuaded that it can. But there is one kind of maverick that never stops winking, and that is Palin. She also spouts \"gobbledygook\", which, interestingly, is a term that was coined by Maverick's grandson, Texas congressman Maury Maverick, who died in 1954. </p> <p><strong>This week </strong>Alexander loved the Osbert Lancaster exhibition at the Wallace Collection: \"How often do you find visitors tittering at an art show?\" He also saw the film How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People: \"Not much of a plot, but a decent parody of the celebrity magazine culture and a delightful portrayal of Graydon Carter by Jeff Bridges.\"</p>",
  "<p>Our family had a real fire for longer than most - well into the early 70s. My dad would kneel reverently before it every morning, piling scrolled-up news-papers into a pyramid before putting on the coal. If it was particularly cold, I would lie on our sofa under a blanket, watching him. Sometimes I would scroll up a newspaper myself, and risk exposing my arm to the cold in order to pass it to him. When the fire got going, I thoroughly enjoyed it: I had earned that heat.</p> <p>The eventual installation of our own gas fire seemed like a bereavement. It seethed sinisterly. You lit it by poking in a match and waiting tensely, with averted face, for the boom. This was not progress as far as I was concerned, and in my adult life I have always try to live in a place with a fire. I will not rent a holiday cottage unless it has one, and real fires draw me repeatedly to places such as the White Horse and Griffin restaurant and hotel in Whitby, or the George hotel in Stamford. </p> <p>But now, suddenly, I am no longer alone in my pyromania. According to the Solid Fuel Association, sales of wood-burning and multi-fuel stoves are up 40% on last year.</p> <p>The motivating factor is the high price of electricity, oil and gas. Whereas gas bills have doubled in a year, new types of stoves are ever more attractive and efficient, and can be linked to central heating systems. The queasy economic and political times are also promoting a survivalist mindset. \"I know at least half a dozen people who've had gas fires disconnected and open fires put in because they're worried about the Russians cutting off our gas,\" says Martin Glynn, the Kent-based spokesman for the National Association of Chimney Sweeps. Jim Lambeth, general manager of the Solid Fuel Association, adds: \"Any solid fuel is seen as safe. You've got it stacked there in the back yard. It's like your piggy bank.\" </p> <p>I light my fire almost every evening between October and April, and if I had a stove I'd keep the glass door open, which would be less efficient but allow me to see the dancing of the flames. Some might think I've gone off the rails morally. Once, when I called my local council here in north London and asked, as a matter of purely academic interest, about the law relating to my firelighting activities, a spokeswoman replied in a disapproving tone, \"We are against any sort of burning, but there is no law relating to it.\" As regards the law she was completely wrong, as we shall see. But what interested me was the priggish tone. </p> <p>The original reason for disapproving of open, or real, fires was smoke. Domestic fuel burning was partly responsible for the smogs of the 1950s. These gave us Margery Allingham's terrific crime novel, The Tiger In The Smoke: \"The sky was yellow as a duster and the rest was granular black, overprinted in grey and lightened by occasional slivers of bright fish colour as a policeman turned in his wet cape.\" But they also killed hundreds of people. They prompted the clean air legislation, which was later consolidated in the Clean Air Act 1993.</p> <p>This designated most towns and all cities as Smoke Control Areas, within which only smokeless solid fuel may be burned, except in the case of appliances approved for burning non-smokeless solid fuel. Ordinary, untreated coal is not smokeless, except in the case of anthracite, which burns too slowly for household use unless you're a particularly skilled firelighter, which I like to think I am. Since it is now fashionable for politicians to admit to drug use, I don't mind declaring that I have in the past experimented with anthracite and untreated wood (which is also not smokeless) while living in a smokeless zone. I've given up now - I'm a reformed character - but it's easy to see how I was tempted down that path. Logs are openly sold at all my local petrol stations, albeit at twice the price they'd be in the countryside. And whereas chimney inspectors apparently patrol German cities, they are not often seen on our own streets. I now confine my own wood burning to the use of twigs to get the smokeless briquettes going, and this is allowed under the smoke-control legislation. </p> <p>Another objection to real fires, whether burning smokeless fuel or not, is that they are environmentally unsound. The issue is quite complicated - or at least it always has been to me - and I once found myself in a moral tangle when starting a fire with a taper made from a Green party leaflet. An open fire is generally an inefficient way of heating a room. Most of the heat goes up the chimney, so more emissions are generated than strictly necessary. But wood as a fuel is considered carbon neutral in that one is only releasing the CO2 captured by the growth of the tree - and trees are renewable. I also wonder whether the labour involved in making a fire might be beneficial here. Our own gas central heating is currently bust and, what with times being hard, we aren't inclined to get it fixed. Whereas I always used to turn on the central heating when I felt cold, I don't just make a fire at the drop of a hat. I put on a jumper instead. And I am more willing to endure a cold day because it increases the satisfaction of lighting a fire in the evening. A fire gives you a reason to be cold.</p> <p>But the final objection to fires is that the firelighter commits the sin of being cosy. When I send out my Christmas cards, which typically feature Mr Pickwick warming his considerable bottom before a roaring blaze, while proclaiming in a speech bubble, \"This ... This is indeed comfort\", I foresee the recipients sneering, especially those that think of themselves as modern. These are the types who might have a flat-screen TV on their chimney breast, which obviously dictates no fire below. Or they might have some display of revolving lights, or a \"flame effect\" fire. Anyone of such pallid tastes would no time for Charles Dickens, whose insecure childhood - according to his biographer Peter Ackroyd - gave him \"an acute sense of, and need for, 'home', and in speaking after the comforts of the hearthside, he reflected the spirit of the times\".</p> <p>It was perhaps an attempt to reconnect with naturalness in the machine age that made the Victorians such lovers of the hearth. They always preferred open fires to the iron stoves that took off in the rest of northern Europe. They liked the look of them, and the mood they created. </p> <p>Open fires need more work than stoves, but I enjoy the work, the sense of practising a traditional craft. When I go out collecting sticks with my sons, I say, \"If it won't snap, I don't want it\", just as my father did to me. I know that you can't cut corners; that you need at least 30 rolled-up sheets of newspaper in the grate before you even think about making your pyramid of kindling. But then again, you might be able to revive a sluggish fire by stretching a sheet of newspaper across the top of the fireplace so as to improve the draw of the blaze. And I know that a room in which a fire burns must be ventilated to reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if one is burning logs, which I never do, as I keep saying. </p> <p>The hearth is the focus of my house, and the television comes a poor second. A fire is more visually interesting than 90% of TV programmes, and has better dialogue, in fact, than most. </p> <p>I keep my invitations (I currently have none) on the mantelpiece and if my wife would let me, I'd keep my unanswered letters skewered there by a dagger, as Sherlock Holmes does. </p> <p>We're in for a cold winter, apparently. Personally I am looking forward to it.</p> <p><strong>What about the environment?</strong><br>Buy a stove - and burn wood</p> <p>Open fires might look great but they will leave any eco aspirations you might harbour up in smoke. Up to 90% of the heat generated will be lost up the chimney. Worse, perhaps, open fires can create considerable draughts, sucking cold air inside the home through any openings they can find. It is far, far more efficient to install a stove, where the heat, exhaust and airflow can all be controlled.</p> <p>The first thing to consider is whether you live in a smoke-control area. If so, you can only use an \"exempted\" stove to burn wood or smokeless solid fuels such as anthracite. (Visit <a href=\"http://www.uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk\">uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk</a> for more info.) Next you need to have your chimney checked out. Chances are it will need to be lined first. Buying a good stove (look for a \"clean burn\" stove) and getting your chimney in order will probably set you back about \u00a31,000. And remember that planning laws mean it must all be done by a HETAS qualified fitter (<a href=\"http://www.hetas.co.uk\">hetas.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>Solid fuels such as anthracite are fossil fuels, so it's best to use wood - broadleaf is better than conifer. But it must be well-seasoned - a process that can take a year or more - and cut to the right size, otherwise it will burn inefficiently and add to your costs by tarring up your stove and chimney.</p> <p>Look for a local supplier that sources timber from sustainable sources (ie a replacement tree is planted when one is cut down). Tree surgeons often sell off their waste wood, but nets of logs on sale in most garages are usually very expensive and poorly seasoned. A well-seasoned log will feel light because it lacks moisture.</p> <p>Finally, when using your stove, keep the door shut and use the air vents - wood should be vented from below, whereas solid fuels are vented from above. And have your chimneys swept twice a year.

  "<p>In January 1879, Tchaikovsky was in Switzerland. He wrote to one of his brothers back in Russia: \"Am reading Little Dorrit. A work of genius! Dickens and Thackeray are the only two men I forgive for being Englishmen. One ought to add Shakespeare, but he lived when this vile nation was not so degraded.\"</p> <p>Shakespeare often surfaces in Tchaikovsky's writings, sometimes oddly. What did he mean, for example, when, in 1886, he noted in his diary: \"At teatime, read King Henry IV. Liked it very much - and I am far from being a Shakespearean\"?</p> <p>Tchaikovsky thought of himself as a musical dramatist and was always looking for suitable opera subjects. Shakespeare was an obvious place to look, but the playwright never quite gave the composer what he was looking for, operatically. In the last months of his life, Tchaikovsky wrote: \"This summer, to make money, I am composing songs and piano pieces, and then I'll finish my recently sketched symphony [the Path\u00e9tique]. After that an opera. But the subject must really attract me; I don't want to do The Merchant of Venice.\" Over the years he considered and rejected many Shakespearean possibilities, but one play kept drawing him back: Romeo and Juliet. \"Nothing is more suitable to my musical character. No kings, no marches, no boring old grand opera. Just love, love, love! And what a delight are the secondary characters: the nurse, Laurence, Tybalt, Mercutio ... From being children heedlessly intoxicated by love, Romeo and Juliet became people, loving, suffering ... How much I want to set about it straight away!\" Sadly, this project produced just one tantalising fragment, a sketch for a love duet found among his papers after his death, which was finished by his pupil, Sergei Taneyev.</p> <p>In the evenings, Tchaikovsky would sometimes play through other musicians' Shakespearean operas at his piano. He hammered out some French composer's Richard III - \"I don't like it!\" - and someone else's even more forgettable Cordelia. In Paris, he enjoyed a performance of Gounod's Rom\u00e9o et Juliette. He reread the plays, splashed out on smart, new leather bindings, and was cross when someone borrowed the first volume and failed to give it back. And he went endlessly to the theatre - in Russia, Europe and America - and recorded his impressions. \"23rd February 1878 - Florence. Between lunch and dinner I composed a song, then went for a walk to the Boboli Gardens. In the evening to the theatre. Salvini was playing Hamlet, but I didn't like him. He is old, ugly and full of mannerisms. Rossi is better.\" He even tried learning English so he could read the Bard in the original. To this end, he enthusiastically joined in a game around his sister's dinner table at which the whole family spoke English, and was annoyed when one of his cousins kept interrupting \"at the most interesting moments in the conversation\".</p> <p>But the finest fruit of Tchaikovsky's Shakespearean dreamings were, in the end, not operas at all, but three single-movement orchestral fantasies or overtures: Romeo and Juliet (1870), The Tempest (1873) and Hamlet (1888). </p> <p>Romeo was Tchaikovsky's first great success, written under the control of his mentor, Balakirev, who told him exactly how to do it: \"Begin straight away - allegro - with fierce sword clashes.\" When Tchaikovsky sent his proposed love-theme for approval, Balakirev scribbled back: \"This tune is simply DELIGHTFUL. When I play it, I imagine you lying naked in your bath with your lady friend, washing your tummy with hot lather from scented soap. There's just one thing I'll say against it; there's little in it of inner, spiritual love, and only passionate physical languor, even slightly Italian. Remember, Romeo and Juliet are not Persian lovers, but Europeans.\" Evidently, Balakirev had not realised Tchaikovsky's sexual orientation. And he seems to have forgotten the lovers were meant to be Italian.</p> <p>Another mentor, the cultural critic Vladimir Stasov, encouraged Tchaikovsky to try The Tempest. He also provided instructions, specifying descriptions of the sea, a theme for Prospero's magic spell, the love music for Miranda and Ferdinand and so on. For a while, the composer resisted. Then, in a few weeks on his own in the Russian countryside, the ideas suddenly came. He described the moment: \"I found myself in an exalted and blissful state of mind, wandering alone about the woods by day and across the immeasurable steppe as evening fell, and sitting at night by an open window and listening to the solemn silence of that remote place, broken now and then by sounds I could not name. During those two weeks, without any effort, as if moved by supernatural force, I completed a rough draft of The Tempest.\" </p> <p>Romeo and Juliet was Tchaikovsky's breakthrough, but The Tempest was almost as important, as it was his first piece to attract the attention of Madame von Meck, who became his patron. She later said: \"The first of your compositions I ever heard was The Tempest. It is impossible to describe the impression it made on me. For days afterwards, I was in a delirium from which I could not emerge.\"</p> <p>Years later, the composer's younger brother nagged him to tackle Hamlet, perhaps even as an opera. The composer dismissed the idea as \"devilishly difficult\". But then, as with The Tempest, ideas suddenly came, and he dashed off one of his most violent and knotty orchestral pieces in five days, starting the very day after finishing the Fifth Symphony. There the story might have ended, but for a distinguished actor-director, Lucien Guitry, who ran the French theatre in St Petersburg. To mark their return to Paris, in 1891, they put on a gala performance - in French - of Hamlet. Guitry asked if he could chop up the composer's \"fantasy-overture\" and use it as incidental music. Tchaikovsky refused permission, writing instead a completely new theatre score.</p> <p>Reviving old theatre music is a tricky business. Separated from the original production and the all-important words, Tchaikovsky's score doesn't make a lot of sense, and, until recently, almost an hour of the composer's mature work remained mostly unheard. It was two years ago that Jane Moss of New York's Lincoln Centre had the idea of creating a semi-staged version with an actor performing fragments of the original play, thereby helping listeners imagine the power of the music in its intended context. </p> <p>Now, for the Southbank Centre's Revealing Tchaikovsky festival, Vladimir Jurowski is going one step further with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, using original instruments and 19th-century styles of playing that balance more effectively with speech. This, together with what remains of the love duet from Romeo and Juliet, give us the only hints we will ever have of what a Shakespearean opera by this great composer might have sounded like.</p> <p>\u2022 Revealing Tchaikovsky is at the Southbank Centre, London, from Wednesday to November 7.

  "<p>The Football Association will enforce the legal requirement for bookmakers to assist in its match-fixing inquiries after launching a probe into allegations of a betting sting at Derby County's recent 2-1 win over Norwich City in the Championship.</p> <p>Bookmakers noted unusual betting patterns during the match at Carrow Road on October 4. Punters in the far east are believed to have placed a flood of money during half-time, although industry observers report that the betting patterns indicated that the punters thought Norwich would win.</p> <p>Bookmakers who are known to have offered their assistance to investigators and the two clubs involved say they have not yet been contacted by the FA but its chairman, David Triesman, said last night that the inquiry would be \"thorough\". </p> <p>\"It will be days before people begin to go through all the information that is needed to get a sense of what may or may not have happened so it is too early to talk about a timescale,\" said Lord Triesman. \"My insistence is that it's thorough.\"</p> <p>The Gambling Act makes provision for all sports governing bodies to demand the assistance of British-based bookmakers when investigating threats to their competitions' integrity.

Since the win over Sheffield United in mid-September that ended that dismal run, his team have strung together five games without defeat. The win over Norwich a fortnight ago made it 12 points from a possible 18.</p> <p>During that match Roy Carroll, Derby's goalkeeper, was sent off five minutes after half-time and Sammy Clingan converted the resulting penalty to equalise. But Derby secured the win five minutes from time, after a defensive mix-up involving Norwich's goalkeeper and centre-half allowed Nathan Ellington to score from close range.</p> <p>The Norwich North MP, Ian Gibson, who attended the Championship match, initially drew attention to the FA's investigations by tabling a parliamentary question to the culture secretary demanding swift action in the inquiry. </p> <p>However, even Gibson reflected that the circumstances of the game were not immediately considered anything other than the normal course of a football match. \"No one who was there thought it suspicious,\" he said.</p> <p>The Norwich chief executive, Neil Doncaster, said his club had yet to be contacted by the FA but he was not pleased with how the matter was raised. \"It is certainly slightly disappointing that the MPs concerned have talked to the media before picking up the phone and talking to us.\"</p> <p>Jewell was also not amused by the intervention of a parliamentarian. \"MPs are having a tough time at the minute because the country's struggling,\" he said. \"Maybe they're trying to deflect the blame.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tartan, says Jonathan Faiers in his new book about the fabric, is the immediately recognisable symbol of a fiercely independent nation. He's right, of course. But is it something we Scots can really embrace as a fashion item? Every couple of years or so, the fabric of our national dress sashays down the catwalk, like that crazy old aunt we love but don't know how to cope with when she comes to stay. What is a fashion-conscious Scot to do?</p> <p>I knew tartan was coming, and I thought I was prepared. I had seen the ad campaign by D&amp;G, the reappearance of plaid on Alexander McQueen's runway, and the bold prints at the House of Holland show. But I didn't quite realise how huge the trend would be this season. It's literally everywhere. You can't move on the high street for the belts, dresses, shoes, bags and even beads (thanks, Topshop) covered in cheap tartan print.</p> <p>A trip round Primark at the moment stirs horrific memories of country dancing at school ceilidhs, and awkward teenage snogs on the dancefloor, bedecked in Royal Stewart - the bright red tartan that Queen Victoria declared the clan tartan of the United Kingdom, and favoured by shortbread-tin, tea-towel and trinket-box manufacturers the world over.</p> <p>And so our dilemma begins. Do we proudly buy into the trend, or do we ignore it, fearful that we look contrived and cliched in the fabric? Such fears are not unfounded. </p> <p>I decided, in a show of national pride and as a fashion experiment, to embrace the trend, and thought I looked the bee's knees with my tartan puff-sleeved blouse, high-waisted flared jeans and wedge heels. \"Long live the Bay City Rollers,\" shouted a passerby as I worked my look on Glasgow's Buchanan Street. </p> <p>Is tartan to be worn only in certain circumstances: to that ceilidh, to the football, as part of the Tartan Army; or as fancy dress in a \"look at us in our ridiculous tartan outfits - we've come as Fran and Anna\" kind of way. (Singing sisters Fran and Anna were the epitome of tartan kitsch. Google them - it's worth it.)</p> <p>As much as Emma Plazalska, from Scotland-based designer boutique chain Cruise, loves House of Holland's bold blue tartan for this season, it's not for her. \"I just can't bring myself to wear it. I adore Kelly Osbourne in the jacket, and Mary Kate Olsen works tartan well, in a clumsy, thrown-together way, but it's just not for me.\" It's not, it seems, for her employer either. \"We haven't bought into the trend heavily at Cruise. Aside from a few select Westwood pieces, we just haven't gone down this route - our customer base hasn't demanded it from us.\"</p> <p>At this year's Scottish Fashion Awards, Henry Holland won the best use of tartan by an international designer award. Event founder Tessa Hartmann introduced the category for the first time, in the third year of the awards, because \"global brands have been hurling themselves into a highland fling with the use of our precious fabric in the past 12 months, and it's wonderful for us as a nation.\"</p> <p>She believes the explosion of tartan on the high street this season can only benefit Scotland. \"The Scottish government and VisitScotland should send out a global message of thanks to the fashion world, for fashion editors and consumers have rekindled their love affair with tartan and that can only benefit the industries involved.\"</p> <p>James Sugden, the group managing director of Johnstons of Elgin, won't argue with that. \"Tartan is never far from the catwalk, but this season we are definitely seeing an increase in sales. We probably haven't been as busy on tartan for some five years.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a huge difference between the sumptuous fabrics woven by companies such as Johnstons and used by the likes of Westwood and McQueen, and the cheap copies in high-street stores. For Mary McGowne, director of the Scottish Style Awards, tartan invokes cliched memories, of \"the Bay City Rollers and the World Cup in 1978\". However, she is not against wearing tartan, provided it is a quality item. \"I have a pair of wide-legged plaid trousers from one of Alexander McQueen's very first collections, and they have stood the test of time. </p> <p>I wouldn't be averse to wearing a piece of vintage tartan. An elaborate cape would be perfect for a romantic Highland retreat. However, I believe tartan only really works to stunning effect when interpreted by someone like Westwood, who has the amazing ability to merge painstaking craft and plush heritage fabrics from textile houses like Lochcarron, with her theatrical signature silhouettes.\"</p> <p>Howie Nicholsby, creator and designer of 21st Century Kilts, who has \"kilted out\" the likes of Vin Diesel and Madonna, is a huge fan of his national fabric. \"We must support any surge in tartan as a fashion trend. Designers such as D&amp;G, Westwood and Commes Des Gar\u00e7ons all use cloth woven in the Borders. My bugbear is not tartan as a trend, but the mislabelling of the kilt - when something that is clearly not a kilt is called such. That cheapens our national dress for me. And some people just don't suit tartan. It's not a forgiving pattern, you know.\" </p> <p>Westwood's use of tartan, so triumphant in her iconic 1993 Anglomania collection, is second to none. Forget clans, the rights and wrongs of wearing tartan, and any of the stuffy tradition that can go with it. Westwood has torn up the rule book year after year and constantly mixes different tartans, all made to order at Lochcarron. Westwood loves the fabric so much she has a tartan carpet in her design studio in Battersea.</p> <p>\"Tartan looks wonderful with everything,\" she says. \"Even other tartans. The idea that this tartan belongs to this house or another was developed by the Victorian tourist industry.\"</p> <p>It is true that we Scots can get a bit precious at times about our tartans. Can a Campbell really wear a McGregor? And how dare these English wear a kilt? But, as Faiers explores in his book, many like to wear our fabric as a display of genuine affection for our nation. The French have a penchant for tartan that goes way back to the auld alliance. My Gallic sister-in-law wore tartan skirts to school (and graduated to a Scottish husband) as did, and still do, many Scottish schoolgirls. But sometimes the wrong use of tartan comes back to prove that perhaps our wariness was right.</p> <p>The mini-kilt has developed an identity all of its own, and not a very savoury one. Unfortunately, as Faiers explains, the mini-kilt has become a sexual item - a favourite of the Japanese \"kogal\" girls who \"sexualise their school uniforms\". Think Go-Go Yubari, the kilted schoolgirl assassin in Kill Bill, and you get the idea.</p> <p>But bad taste aside, maybe Lorraine Pringle, marketing director of Warehouse and a proud Scot, sums it all up perfectly. \"When I see tartan in fashion it just makes me smile and think of home.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Waterford Crystal staff fight factory closure plans</h2> <p>Trade union leaders vowed yesterday to fight plans that will almost spell the end of glass-making at Waterford Crystal's last remaining factory in Ireland. With the prospect of 280 job losses, leaving only 70 staff at the plant at Kilbarry, besides those employed at the firm's visitor centre, unions blamed bad management for bringing home-grown manufacture to a standstill. Unite members were expected to lobby the taoiseach, Brian Cowen, and government officials over the cuts. \"Alongside Guinness [Waterford crystal is] one of the last iconic brands,\" said Unite's regional organiser, Walter Cullen. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Google could make \u00a3100 million from new gambling ad law</h2> <p>Google is to relax its global ban on gambling adverts for web users in England, Scotland and Wales.

Analysts reacted positively to the group's comments on global demand for handsets this year - Nokia said it expected phone volumes to rise by 10.5% to 1.26bn in 2008 as sales in emerging markets offset falling demand in western Europe - and expressed relief that it had not delivered a gloomy outlook for next year. <br><strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p>",
  "<p>If Estelle Swaray displayed something of a sense of entitlement as she sauntered on stage to collect two prizes at the 13th Mobo (Music of Black Origin) awards on Wednesday night, it should come as little surprise. As the 28-year-old rapper and singer drily remarked: \"It took me a while to get here.\" And along the way, winning has become second nature. </p> <p>Even as she picked up her first Mobo, for best newcomer in 2004, the award show thing must have been getting a bit old for Swaray. She had already been voted best female artist three years running at the UK Hip-Hop awards: if it had been the World Cup, she'd have been allowed to keep it. </p> <p>Her 2008 elevation to household name status comes four years after her first UK hit, and almost a decade after she started appearing as a guest artist on other people's records. Hers is the kind of upward career curve that has all but become a thing of the past as record company profits dwindle, marketing budgets shrink and developing artists are given less time and money to help them find their audience. </p> <p>Yet Estelle's success this year has happened despite the British music business, not because of it. She first looked, then moved, to America for the support and encouragement she was unable to find at home. </p> <p>As well as picking up the best UK female award, Estelle also walked away with best song for her single American Boy, which topped the British chart in March and made the top 10 in America. A collaboration with the Black Eyed Peas producer will.i.am and featuring a guest rap from Kanye West, the record marks the consummation of Estelle's marriage of English pop and American R&amp;B.</p> <p>Its success has not surprised experts. \"When you have a good record, sometimes there's a struggle - you need marketing and machines to work it - but when you have a smash you can just throw it out the window and the whole world will buy it,\" says Russell Simmons, the American mogul who founded the Def Jam imprint. </p> <p>\"I liked American Boy. It has that intangible cultural thing that makes a pop record feel like a hit.\" The album it is taken from, Shine - Estelle's second - was nominated for the Nationwide Mercury prize, but it is only Swaray's passport and west London accent that qualifies it as British. Overseen by the Ohio-born, New York-based soul star John Legend, whose Atlantic Records-funded imprint, HomeSchool, released it, most of Shine was recorded and mixed in America, with a succession of US A-list rap and R&amp;B producers. </p> <p>The ironies of Estelle's vindication on Wednesday will be delicious enough for her to savour as she resumes the US tour interrupted for a flying visit for the Mobos. She has had to make her own luck, forging the relationships that have proved crucial to her success herself. It is a pattern that has long been ingrained.</p> <p>Born in Hammersmith, west London, to a Senegalese mother and Grenadan father, Estelle learned self-reliance and responsibility at an early age. After her parents split up she helped her mother raise her siblings (she is the second of eight children), but still knuckled down at school, leaving at 18 with a GNVQ in media and communications before embarking on a succession of music-related jobs. The website Darker Than Blue published some of her music journalism, and she worked behind the counter of the London record shop Deal Real, where she was encouraged to make her own music. </p> <p>She began to rap on tracks with British rappers and producers - often people she had met at the shop or through her journalism work. After recording with Blak Twang, winner of the first best hip-hop Mobo, and releasing music on her own label, she signed to Sir Richard Branson's V2 imprint, which released her debut album, The 18th Day, in 2004. Two singles made the UK top 20, but, according to Swaray, the label wasn't prepared for her to do so well: subsequent staffing changes left her without a champion in the company, and after being pushed towards unappealing collaborations with indie artists, she and V2 parted ways. </p> <p>For many artists that would have been the end, but Swaray's flair for networking had already provided an escape route. Before her first album was finished, she had spotted Kanye West eating at a Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles restaurant in Los Angeles. She approached him to ask for an introduction to one of his up and coming associates.</p> <p>\"She walked up to Kanye and said, 'Hey, I'm Estelle from London, I love your work, who's John Legend? I wanna meet him',\" recalls Legend. \"And it was funny, 'cos I was sitting right there beside him.\" They stayed in touch, and when Estelle began looking for a new home, Legend - by then a major international star - was in the process of setting up his label. She became his first signing. </p> <p>Vindication has not been without its controversies. In an interview with Alex Macpherson published in the Guardian at the end of March, Swaray was critical of the way white singers such as Adele and Duffy have been marketed and promoted as icons of British soul music while black artists, historically a tougher sell, get less exposure and attention. She did not attack any of her peers, but subsequent coverage of her remarks implied criticism. </p> <p>\"I can understand why a white person would be excited to see another white person doing soul music, but don't exclude great black artists,\" is Legend's take on what his protege was trying to say. \"I think Estelle is proving there's a market for a young black British artist doing soul music too. There's room for everybody if you make the right record.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Fanta Swaray, January 1980, in west London to a Senegalese mother and Grenadan father.

  "<p>If No Country for Old Men hadn't been so brilliant, and if the Coen brothers didn't in any case have such a hard-won and thoroughly earned reputation as distinctive and intelligent film-makers, this wouldn't have felt like such a letdown. Burn After Reading is the Coens' most mediocre film in a long time: a desperately strained black comic farce. It is their worst feature since The Ladykillers, which at least had the excuse of being a remake script they never really intended to make themselves.</p> <p>What a dog's brunch. There are one or two successful jokes, and a continuous, surface level of plausible narrative activity. But the big names in the cast are all playing to their weaknesses, the story doubles in manic pointlessness with every minute that passes and the final, abysmal lines of the movie betray an abject throwing in of the towel: a revelation that the Coens couldn't be bothered, or hadn't time, to think up a proper ending.</p> <p>Burn After Reading somehow brings their unhappiest vices to the surface: their genius for eccentric lo-fi and quirkiness has been transformed into something slapdash, tonally chaotic, uncaring and unfunny, with a baffling streak of crudity. It appears to be premised - like Ocean's Twelve, Thirteen, Seventeen etc - on the idea that an A-list gang-show lineup will aggregate enough goodwill to see it through. Coming straight after the Coens' Oscar-winning triumph, it is maybe the complete opposite of a dead cat bounce. Just as the deceased feline will gain a moment's illusory height on hitting the floor, so a powerfully alive animal might ricochet downwards off the ceiling, stunned, after an award-winning jump.</p> <p>John Malkovich stars as Osbourne Cox, a CIA agent who is summoned to the office of his superiors and sacked, apparently for having a drinking problem; the accusation comes from a priggish and religious colleague at whom Cox fires a tremendous comeback zinger which I won't give away. His woes do not end there. He is married to Katie, played by Tilda Swinton, a paediatrician with an icy, uptight attitude who is nonetheless conducting an adulterous affair with Harry Pfarrer, a married federal marshal played by George Clooney. Although entitled to carry a gun, Harry cheerfully tells people he hasn't discharged his weapon in 20 years' service, a revelation that will discomfit those familiar with Chekhov's maxim about what happens to a gun introduced in act one.</p> <p>In a spirit of revenge for his job loss, Cox writes a lid-lifting memoir of his time at the agency's Balkan desk, and a CD containing the top-secret manuscript winds up in the hands of Linda Litzke and Chad Feldheimer, played by Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. They are brainless bozos who work at a gym and figure on selling this document to the Russian embassy to pay for Linda's longed-for cosmetic surgery.</p> <p>Exasperatingly, the fundamental plot-point of how Cox's CD finds its way into the gym is fudged, and the story itself runs calamitously aground. Almost every actor is cast and directed in a way calculated to bring out his or her worst traits. Clooney goes into full ill-advised comedy mode: he has his non-handsome beard on the go; he waggles his head around; he does huge mugging \"reaction\" faces with big frowny expressions, furious grimaces and evil grins. If he was in a silent film, playing the man who ties the young woman to the railroad track, any responsible director would tell him to tone it down.</p> <p>John Malkovich gives us the shouty, angry performance that he can do on autopilot. Time and again, he goes into the classic Malkovich riff: losing his temper on the phone and letting rip with the F-word. Tilda Swinton does icy very well, but there is something disconcertingly humourless about her performance; the frost should sparkle more. Frances McDormand goes into her own default setting - the goofy, faintly bug-eyed klutz with the nerdish smile. Playing the knuckle-headed fitness freak Chad, Brad Pitt is at least unfamiliar. He is so clean-shaven and moisturised as to resemble a baby seal. There are laughs to be had in realising that this is super-cool Brad Pitt we're watching, pretending to be uncool, but as with Linda there is limited comedy value in characters being just stupid.</p> <p>To return to Malkovich: strangely, he is the strongest contributor, because he insists on taking it seriously. He looks like a refugee from a very much more serious and interesting film: a film by the Coen brothers, in fact. There is even a powerful and rather moving scene when he confesses to his aged and disabled father that he has left government service. Another draft of the script that revolved the entire action around him might not have been a bad idea.</p> <p>I am not one of the people who believe that the Coens should stay away from broad, straight-ahead comedy. Far from it. I was a fan of their little-loved screwball effort Intolerable Cruelty, whose constituent elements seemed to gel much more satisfactorily. But Burn After Reading is just too frantic, too frenzied. It goes up in smoke.</p>",
  "<p>This week I dropped in on an estate agent to test the state of the market. Everyone in the place stopped dead. Beaming smiles spread across faces. Two salesmen leapt to their feet. I appeared to be a member of that dying species: a customer. Seats were thrust at me. Would I like a coffee, a discount, or a driver to my favourite maisonette? I might have been telling the Jehovah's Witnesses that I was really seeking Jesus. Only violins and a celestial choir were missing.</p> <p>My ongoing search for good news among the ruins is proving ever more fruitful. When I left the estate agent I immediately bought shares in kindness, with a side bet on courtesy and brotherly love.</p> <p>Last spring, I wondered if the plummeting popularity of Gordon Brown might liberate him to do what he really wanted - such as govern well. The indicators I listed were an end to 42-day detention, early withdrawal from Iraq, cheaper Olympics, curbing the bonus culture, curtailing defence extravagance and cancelling ID cards and the NHS computer database system. If he did these things, his ratings might rise and he would save the exchequer billions.</p> <p>So it has come to pass. The first four items are already in train and rumour has it that major defence projects are for the chop. School attainment tests are being abolished, beyond my wilder dreams. Only ID cards and NHS computers still limp on, surely not for much longer. The truth is that good government may now burst out all over. The oleaginous super-confidence of New Labour is in the descendant. Spending on ill-considered projects, consultants and gimmicks will end. Taxing will have to join hands with spending. As a result, shares in Gordon Brown have been highly volatile, but they are now outperforming the market. Indeed, in some media markets, they are approaching bubble status.</p> <p>The same onset of realism is extending to the private sector. Carbon-crazy plans for totemic City skyscrapers modelled on cheese-graters, testicles and mobile phones, are being torn up. I once predicted that Canary Wharf would, like the Empire State Building, end up sheltering charity gift shops and asylum seekers. It may take time to realise, but it will happen.</p> <p>Overseas I would be surprised if that obscenely speculative bubble, Dubai, which currently hosts a quarter of the world's cranes, does not see total collapse. Like Ozymandias's \"vast and trunkless legs of stone\", its mile-high towers, palm islands and patio air-conditioners will moulder and decay. The \"sneer of cold command\" will wither. First overrun by refugees and squatters, Dubai will eventually return to where \"boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far away\".</p> <p>On the domestic front I would buy shares in home cooking, amateur dramatics and conversation. Teenagers will be civil to their parents. Luxury restaurants are already slashing their lunch prices. Taxis are suddenly available. The Donmar Warehouse company has declared a top price of \u00a329. \"Greed is good\" bonuses are in freefall, at least until the lax regulation of tax havens contrives to harness them. Dorset partridges are cheering at the storm of abuse that has greeted the shooting holiday of American AIG executives to their corner of the wood. </p> <p>This may spell trouble for purveyors of shotguns, Porsches, fitted kitchens and second homes in the Cotswolds. But it is leading to a surge in upmarket car-boot sales. One American community has already been forced to limit these to one per household per month.</p> <p>The market in humility is thus soaring. When Brown was challenged on his pledge to \"end boom and bust\" he meekly tried a joke, that his promise covered only \"an end to Tory boom and bust\". The Labour version was clearly alive and kicking.</p> <p>Dribbling apologies are now emerging from the mouths of bankers and regulators. Chary of being sued, they risk only that they \"feel wretched\" or \"regret certain decisions\". Yesterday the head of the Financial Services Authority, Hector Sants, went so far as to confess to \"business models ill-equipped to survive the stress ... a fact that we regret\". It was like a pilot protesting that his plane was flying just fine except for the engines. Such gestures of remorse may signify little, but they restore some dignity to public life.</p> <p>As humility shares boom, the concept will reach beyond the rituals of atonement. It will infuse political discourse with caution for years to come. Just as 9/11 traumatised national defence, so the credit crunch has traumatised economic management. Whether, as with 9/11, that management is distorted by the trauma remains to be seen. </p> <p>Jeremy Bentham, one of the fathers of British political economy, stipulated that \"he who has most wealth must be regarded by a legislator as having most happiness. But the same quantity of happiness will not go on increasing in anything near the same proportion as the quantity of wealth.\"</p> <p>This disproportionality has been tested to destruction by the recent hysteria of City incomes. The result is that, after a decade of widening wealth differentials, they should start to narrow. Non-economic components of what we vaguely refer to as the good life will take more prominence. The hedge-fund speculator will learn, with Voltaire, that it is best to cultivate one's garden. This will surely be a good thing. Economists will move away from their failed models to study human history and behaviour. Britain might inch up the University of Michigan's world happiness survey from its present miserable ranking of 21st, below Mexico and the US.</p> <p>We might even see a resurgence of the \"happiness\" movement of the early 1970s; of Schumacher's \"small is beautiful\" economic theory. We might find a new appreciation for the king of Bhutan's edict on the importance of \"gross national happiness\", and for John Ralston Saul's remark that the American mission of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" was nothing to do with money. Saul called for a more subtle understanding of contentment, \"to escape the 20th-century idea that you should smile because you're at Disneyland\".</p> <p>While it may be too early for a bull market in gaiety, we can surely start investing in sanity and pragmatism. In times of trouble, Britons have always adopted a stance of patience tinged with optimism. As Mrs Micawber said of her husband: \"I have known him come home to supper with a flood of tears and a declaration that nothing was now left but a jail; and yet go to bed making a calculation of the expense of putting bow-windows to the house, 'in case anything turns up'.\"</p> <p>We should all be building bow-windows.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Four years ago Annie Smith (not her real name) walked into her GP's surgery and pleaded for help. </p> <p>\"I'd been sick for ages, my blood pressure was through the roof and I was worried that something was seriously wrong,\" she says. \"The last thing I expected was to be told I was 12 weeks pregnant. I was still having periods.\" </p> <p>As a single mother on benefits, suffering with depression and chronic health problems, Smith realised she could not cope with being pregnant. After a few \"very difficult days\" she decided to have an abortion. \"I just knew it was the right thing to do. I had to think of my two children. What use am I to them even more sick, or dead?\" </p> <p>What Smith had not realised was just how difficult it would be to get an abortion - she lives in Northern Ireland where the procedure is illegal in almost all circumstances. A friend helped her scrape together the cash to go to England for a termination, and the pair kept it a secret because, she says, \"It's just not something you could tell people about where I live.</p> <p>\"If it had not been for my friend, I don't know what I would have done. I had <br>absolutely no money. I was living on benefits. The whole thing was so distressing. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. If we had the same rights here as the rest of the UK, I could have had my abortion without all that additional stress. It just doesn't make sense to me.\"</p> <p>Smith's experience stemmed from the fact that the UK's 1967 Abortion Act was passed when Northern Ireland had its own parliament - and even after direct rule was imposed in the early 1970s the law was never extended. Now that could be about to change. Next week an amendment to the embryology and human fertilisation bill, tabled by Labour MP Diane Abbott, is due to be debated in parliament; if passed, it will extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland. This challenge to the current law has triggered outrage from anti-abortion campaigners, not to mention Northern Ireland's mainstream parties - on both sides of the political divide.</p> <p>Anti-abortion campaigners have been mobilising all summer, holding public town hall-style meetings and gearing up for a \"Rally for Life\" scheduled for tomorrow at Stormont. The leading pro-life group, Precious Life, also launched a prominent poster and bus advertising campaign a week ago to drum up support.</p> <p>On the other side of the debate, pro-choice groups are also taking their case to politicians, launching a petition on the Downing Street website and holding regular public meetings. In the summer, the FPA (formerly the Family Planning Association) launched its latest campaign for women's right to choose, and it notes that more than 50,000 women have had to leave Northern Ireland in search of abortions in the past 40 years - many in the later stages of pregnancies because of delays caused by financial hardship. In 2007 alone, it estimates, around 1,400 women fled, paying up to \u00a32,500 each for clinic and travel costs. Audrey Simpson, director of the FPA in Northern Ireland, says the situation amounts to \"discrimination\" against women, particularly poorer women such as Smith.</p> <p>Goretti Horgan of the pro-choice group Alliance for Choice agrees, and says that some women are so desperate they are buying abortion pills on the internet. She adds that, according to one survey of GPs in Northern Ireland, 11% \"have seen the results of amateur abortions\".</p> <p>There are very few political figures in Northern Ireland who are openly in favour of the extension of the 1967 Act - the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party are all against it - but Dawn Purvis, leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, says it is about time people such as Smith were heard. As an outspoken pro-choice advocate, Purvis says she comes across \"all kinds of women\" who have to leave the country for a termination.</p> <p>\"There was the 17-year-old girl who was just about to start her A-levels when she found out she was pregnant. Her boyfriend had left her. The pregnancy was enormously difficult for her and she just couldn't go through with it. There was a woman who had grown-up children - she thought she had been through the menopause, and was feeling suicidal at the prospect of having more children. There was another woman who found herself pregnant but by the time she raised the money to go to England to have an abortion she was over the [legal] limit. </p> <p>This is women's lives we are talking about. That women in Northern Ireland are treated differently from women in Bradford or Birmingham or London is a national disgrace.\"</p> <p>So why has the Abortion Act never been extended to Northern Ireland? Liam Gibson of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child - an anti-abortion group established in 1967 specifically to challenge the Abortion Act - says that it has never been applied \"because the people of Northern <br>Ireland simply don't want it\". He argues that people in the rest of the UK and pro-choice campaigners \"just don't understand\" Northern Ireland and the fact that it is \"more socially conservative\", and he objects to any suggestion that the law should be extended, saying, \"It's a matter for the assembly, not Westminster.\"</p> <p>Purvis agrees with Gibson that to some degree Northern Ireland has always been a more conservative society, but says he and the mainstream politicians are \"spectacularly out of touch\" with the reality of people's lives today. She feels that the louder anti-abortion voices \"drown out\" those of more moderate women and men who support the right to choose. \"We are criminalising women and we have a situation where people are fearful of talking openly about abortion, never mind admitting to having one.\" </p> <p>Abbott has been accused of trying to impose abortion on Northern Ireland against the express wishes of the assembly - an accusation she rejects. For her, the issue is simply about women's rights, and enabling women to have a voice. \"This is an issue that dare not speak its name in Northern Ireland,\" she says.</p> <p>There have been controversial suggestions - widely denied - of some kind of deal between the government and the Democratic Unionists (DUP) to prevent the Abortion Act being extended. It is difficult to see how this might happen if a vote does take place, since MPs are granted a free vote on the issue in parliament. But after the nine DUP MPs voted in favour of the 42-day detention of terror suspects earlier this year - helping the government to win the vote in the Commons - questions were asked about what the \"trade-off\" was. Some pro-choice campaigners, including Horgan, suggest a \"soft whip\" is being applied to MPs on the basis that if they vote for the amendment it could threaten the peace process.</p> <p>Jeffrey Donaldson, an MP and member of the legislative assembly (MLA) for the DUP, and head of the all-party Pro-Life Group in the assembly, denies any kind of deal has been struck but says he has anecdotal evidence that many MPs would consider voting against the amendment if it would destabilise the peace process. If the amendment were carried, Donaldson says, there \"would definitely be a constitutional upset\" because Northern Ireland MLAs believe it is a decision that should rest with the assembly and not Westminster. The assembly could, he says, \"refuse to implement\" the extension of the act even if MPs in Westminster voted in favour.</p> <p>What happens next - and whether a constitutional crisis would indeed ensue - hinges first on whether the speaker calls the amendment for a vote, and, ultimately, on whether the pro-choice majority in the Commons votes in favour. Les Reid of the Belfast Humanist Association, another pro-choice advocate, believes that for all the threats of constitutional crisis, the anti-abortion lobby's protestations may come to nothing in the long term. \"The DUP and the Catholic church warned that gay rights would never be accepted in Northern Ireland, but time has proved them wrong,\" he says. \"Likewise, if the abortion laws are extended, all that will happen is that, eventually, women who have been forced to find access [elsewhere] will be able to get treatment they need.\"</p> <p>For Smith, an extension in the law can't come a moment too soon. \"I understand that many people do not agree with abortion,\" she says. \"That is their right and I respect it. But I don't see why they should be able to impose their views on me or any other woman. It's a disgrace that I had to go through what I did.\"</p>",
  "<p>To say that Wednesday night's 2008 presidential debate was our best so far is to say precious little, but it's true nevertheless. According to a survey conducted by <a href=\"http://www.freepress.net/debates\">Free Press</a>, the national, nonpartisan media reform group, and devised by Andrew Tyndall, publisher of Tyndall Report: \"A virtually identical majority of both candidates' supporters picked Schieffer as the best (62% of McCain's; 63% of Obama's) and almost nobody ranked NBC's Brokaw No. 1 (8% and 6%, respectively). Jim Lehrer of PBS was ranked better than Brokaw, worse than Schieffer\". </p> <p>I'm not sure Schieffer's questions were any better than the others, but the questions in a presidential debate don't matter unless they are really stupid \u2014 like when the late <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9gSyku-fc\">Bernard Shaw asked Mike Dukakis</a> how he would like his wife being brutally raped. Since it's impossible to force a candidate to actually answer a question without appearing overly rude, the best thing a moderator can do is get out of the way and allow the candidates to define themselves in ways that honestly highlight the differences they share and the implications of these differences for their prospective presidencies. </p> <p>That happened repeatedly last night. McCain began the night quite \"aggressively\" as the pundits kept saying over and over. He was also full of gimmicks, referring over and over to the newly-famous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/oct/16/joe-the-plumber\">Joe the Plumber</a>. </p> <p>McCain even spoke to him repeatedly as a surrogate for the rest of America. It's too bad for McCain that Joe does not appear to have been an undecided voter. I have received emails this morning informing me that he is both a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/joe-in-the-spotlight/?hp\">registered Republican</a> and was a registered to vote with the Natural Law Party. I've seen other, more incriminating allegations that, if true, will make both Joe and John rue the day he was mentioned. I'm sure this will amuse journalists all day long. But ultimately Joe is beside the point and it's an absolute wonder to me why John McCain imagined a gimmick like this guy \u2014 why not <a href=\"http://www.bobthebuilder.com/uk/about_bob.asp\">Bob the Builder</a> or Boris the Banker or Barry the Barista? \u2014 might help him turn this election around. Undecided voters were not looking to see whether McCain would be \"aggressive\" or when and how he would bring up William Ayers. They were trying to figure out what kind of president each man would be and what that presidency would mean for people like themselves.</p> <p>In that regard \u2014 though the pundits did not appear to notice this until the insta-polls came in \u2014 most people don't find the idea of a McCain presidency appealing. Sure, as <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411909182439021.html\">Karl Rove claims</a>, Obama has yet to \u2013 cue the clich\u00e9 \u2013 \"close the sale\" but most of the customers have already left McCain's showroom. Why, exactly? Nobody knows. Personally I find him mercurial, erratic, personally cloying and dangerously old for this kind of job and incompetent in exactly the areas that a president needs to be expert at the moment. I'm not so crazy about his politics, either. And his running mate is a bad joke \u2014 well actually, she's a good joke, but a bad running mate, and would be an even worse vice-president and an unthinkably bad vice-president. And yes, I happen to like Barack Obama more than any politician in my adult lifetime. So I don't trust my own judgment on these matters. I'm as un-undecided as a person can possibly be.</p> <p>But if you look at the debate from the point of view of those who might have been undecided, and from McCain's perspective of how to reach them, he had only two real choices. He had tried to play by the rules of comity and explain to people why he'd be a more competent steward of their future than Obama in the previous two debates \u2014 as did his running mate Palin in her debate with Joe Biden \u2014 and all he did was increase Obama's lead in swing states to the point where we may be looking at a landslide. McCain could not win this debate on points no matter how impressed Wolf Blitzer was with his \"energy\". His only hope of winning was to \u2014 somehow \u2014 put Obama away. McCain had to make his opponent appear unacceptable to the broad middle and offer himself as the last guy standing. And given what we know about McCain's ambition and willingness to lie, flip-flop, pander and cajole, he would have done it if he could have figured out how. </p> <p>Since he couldn't, his only choice was to try to restore his pre-election reputation and lose with dignity, without the voters but with the media back in his corner. Instead he did a little of everything. He went after Obama with a feather duster. He spoke about his own honour and reputation but pretty much ignored the concerns of voters, unless they happen to be plumbers who wished to buy their own businesses but did not want to pay additional taxes on income or profits above $250,000.</p> <p>Obama, meanwhile, just stood there and said, subliminally, \"I may be black and have a funny name with 'Hussein' in the middle of it and it rhymes with Osama, but I can do this job. This other guy, the old war hero who keeps calling you his 'friends' can't \u2014 at least not in a time of economic meltdown.\"</p> <p>Stick a fork in this election. For anyone who is not a conservative ideologue of some sort, it is really no choice at all. And thanks to Bob Schieffer for allowing both candidates to show us that. </p> <p>The Age of Obama began last night.</p>",
  "<p>If you were looking for an explanation as to why John McCain's campaign is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/us/politics/15poll.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;adxnnl=\" 1_e\" f=\"slogin&amp;adxnnlx=&quot;1224043051-odCp6IWacfSxnc7yi+OINg&quot;\" \">floundering so badly</a> you could do worse than come to Roanoke.</p> <p>While the town is in no sense a bellwether, most of the factors that are dogging him nationally are clearly evident here. I refer not to the issues - the economy, the war and so on - but the political, strategic and organisational dynamics that give the impression of a campaign about to implode. The situation in Roanoke, and the surrounding area, exposes five central weaknesses with the McCain campaign thus far.</p> <p><strong>1) His <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">own supporters don't like him</a></strong>. Or at least they don't like him enough. This counters the dominant narrative of the primary season that Democrats were bitterly divided while the Republicans quickly rallied around their candidate. I have yet to meet a Democrat here who supported Hillary Clinton who bears a grudge against Barack Obama. That doesn't mean they don't exist. But Obama only won this town narrowly, I've met a lot of Democrats and they all seem to be behind him. On the other hand, the Republicans have no great love for McCain. They respect him - or at least they respect his military service. But most did not vote for him (Huckabee won Virginia and Roanoke) and they talk about him in much the same way that Democrats spoke about Kerry in 2004. He's the candidate they've settled for, not the one they wanted. They do however love Sarah Palin who has galvanised many into action. But at the end of the day huge support for the number two just doesn't have the same impact. <br> <strong>2) He has few effective surrogates.</strong> In the two and a half weeks that I've been here, the Democrats have had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/video/2008/oct/14/bill-clinton\">rallies and meetings with Bill Clinton</a>, Indiana senator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">Evan Bayh</a> (standing in for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/deadlineusa/2008/oct/05/uselections2008\">Joe Biden </a>whose mother-in-law was dying) and former Democratic National Committee chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/01/uselections2008.virginia\">Terry McAuliffe</a>. On Friday, Barack Obama is coming. The Republicans have had no one and as of yet plan to have no one. If you cast about for those who might speak for him, you can see why that would be. Obama can count on his wife, Michelle Obama, Biden, Biden's wife Jill and the Clintons to speak for him. McCain could not send out his wife, Cindy, George W Bush or George HW Bush to stump for him. Indeed, for the first few weeks he would barely send Palin out on her own, either because she was not ready or was in preparation for her debate. So while the Obama camp has been covering huge amounts of electoral turf, getting free local television coverage and energising their supporters on the way, the McCain campaign has all too often been travelling in a pack and leaving little opportunity for anyone, including him, to come to a place like Roanoke. <br> <strong>3) Neither he nor Palin has been here. </strong>A look at the election results of 2004 shows that Bush won by racking up huge majorities in small county after small county which in the end more than compensated for his poor showing in the cities. He didn't just win them. He won them big. If McCain is going to win Virginia, he has to take the southwestern region of the state by a sizeable margin. At present, that is not going to happen. Local Democrats say that Obama needs to win 40% in this area to be viable in the rest of the state. A<a href=\"http://www.tricities.com/tri/news/local/article/latest_mason_dixon_poll_shows_s outhwest_virginia_favors_mccain_over_obama/14598/\"> poll taken 10 days ago</a> gave him 39%. Given other trends, it's almost certainly much higher now. A visit, particularly by Palin, would make a huge difference in a region like this. Instead they both went to Virginia Beach (see point 2) and then she headed to Richmond - a city he is never going to win.<br> <strong>4) He is being outspent and has been outorganised.</strong> Last month, Roanoke city, which is Democratic, saw more than three times the increase of registered voters as the county, which is heavily Republican. The Obama campaign has <a href=\"http://obama.3cdn.net/716d686803fcf88101_7gdymv24j.pdf\">48 offices </a> and a further 19 sub-offices in Virginia. The <a href=\"http://virginia.johnmccain.com/content/sitecontentmain.aspx?guid=\" 6e4ed930-3f71-\" 4f83-a7ca-42ea9e218a26\">McCain campaign has 21</a>. Obama has spent more than <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/180256\">twice as much as McCain in television ads in the region</a>. The combined effect of those advantages is that while Obama's message is constantly being relayed on the airwaves and in person while volunteers mobilise the base, the physical and political presence of the McCain campaign is at best patchy.<br> <strong>5) He shouldn't have to either come here or spend money here.</strong> Virginia has not voted Democratic since 1964. The last time before that was 1948. The very fact that McCain should be spending money, organising and campaigning here tells you just how much trouble he is in. In North Carolina, Indiana and most recently Missouri, Obama is encroaching heavily into what should be McCain's safest territory. He is forcing McCain to spend money and time in places that ought to be safe or risk losing them entirely. The last place a Republican presidential candidate needs to be thinking about three weeks before polling day is southwest Virginia. But if McCain doesn't think about it, he can't win the state. And if he doesn't win the state, it's difficult to see how he can win the country.</p>",

  "<p>Department store House of Fraser, part owned by troubled Icelandic retail investor Baugur, is insisting it is not short of funds and would consider buying Baugur's stake if the shares are put up for sale.</p> <p>The retail chain, which has 65 stores and more than 8,000 staff, is 35% owned by Baugur. The retail specialist used loans from collapsed bank Kaupthing, which has now been taken over by the Icelandic government, to buy the stake.</p> <p>There has been speculation that some of the stores in the Baugur/Kaupthing empire are under increasing financial pressure. Last week, the All Saints fashion chain, which has 70 stores and 465 staff and is also part of the Baugur empire, temporarily lost its revolving credit facility and had to scramble to get its credit line restored.</p> <p>But House of Fraser issued a statement, saying it was in good financial shape: \"We would like to emphasise that House of Fraser has all the funding in place to operate successfully. We have minimal exposure to the tragedy that is happening in Iceland. However, should any of the debt or the minority shareholdings in House of Fraser be put up for sale, we will examine it on a case by case basis.</p> <p>\"With the quality of the business and what we have achieved to date, we have always had parties approach us trying to be part of the act. That has not changed. Our responsibility is to the long term future of the business and our employees, and we will always act in their best interest.\"</p> <p>The HoF comments came just a day after a similar statement was issued by Mosaic - the group behind Oasis, Karen Millen, Warehouse, Principles and Coast, which is owned 49% by Baugur and 20% by Kaupthing's private equity division. The Mosaic group operates more than 2,000 stores and employs 13,000 staff.</p> <p>Its chief executive Derek Lovelock said Mosaic \"does not require saving\". He added that the group had \"sufficient funding in place to meet all foreseeable obligations\" and the directors were \"examining all potential avenues to secure long term funding\".</p> <p>Private equity investor John Moulton, of Alchemy Partners, has been in contact with Mosaic and House of Fraser to express and interest in buying the businesses.</p> <p>Billionaire Sir Philip Green, meanwhile, is still attempting to acquire Baugur's debt, which could give him effective control of the entire Baugur empire, which also includes Whistles, Jane Norman, the Iceland supoermarket group, Hamley's, Wyevale Garden Centres and the Goldsmiths, Mappin &amp; Webb and Aurum jewellery businesses.</p> <p>He faces competition from other private equity groups, including the UK's Permira and US-based Texas Pacific.</p> <p>One executive close to one of the interested parties said: \"The Icelandic government is trying to get an auction going.

  "<p>A reputedly priceless Goya etching from the Disasters of War series was stolen last month from a gallery in the Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1. Visiting the exhibition in the Andean city days after the theft, I found a photocopy in place of Goya's Sad Premonitions, with an optimistic caption: \"Space reserved for the return of the work.\"<br> The Goya exhibition, on loan from Zaragosa in Spain, was at the Gilberto Alzate Avenda\u00f1o Foundation, in a colonial house in Bogot\u00e1's old quarter, whose narrow streets with brightly painted houses rise steeply into the Andean mist. The theft sparked debates about access to art, even a hoax claim by a terrorist group that turned out to be from a professor incensed by the high cost of ticket prices.</p> <p>Yet no one argued that the masterpieces were out of place. Goya's scenes of torture and massacre, with blindfold captives and smirking bystanders, could have been drawn from news reports of recent years in a country that has suffered South America's longest-running war. Almost two centuries after this graphic testimony of Napoleonic atrocities in Spain, viewers seemed mesmerised. Schoolchildren and art students clustered open-mouthed around the small works, or sketched furiously on their pads.</p> <p>The Goya exhibition coincided with two group shows of Colombian contemporary art that reflect sometimes disturbing aspects of the country's reality. On my third visit to the country in two years, I met writers, artists, film-makers and musicians who have formed part of a resurgence of contemporary arts in the country, which is to be celebrated this weekend in a cross-arts festival, Colombiage, at the Riverside Studios in London. Many are finding their own responses to a war that has involved guerrillas, paramilitaries and the army, and been funded in part by kidnapping and narco-trafficking. </p> <p>The Alcuadrado gallery was founded in 2003 to put on site-specific shows in abandoned or forgotten corners of Colombia's cities, from disused factories and parking lots to colonial churches. Without Remedy, a group show in a derelict hospital in Bogot\u00e1's barrio La Esmeralda, extends eerily through the dank concrete corridors and vacant wards of the Santa Rosa clinic. The show takes up five storeys.<br> One mischievously allegorical piece specially commissioned for the space, Jaime \u00c1vila's Silk Hands (2008), consists of velvet mice with red-bulb eyes. It was inspired by the artful dodgers downtown on the Carrera S\u00e9ptima, Bogot\u00e1's main artery, who lifted the artist's wallet. The dimly lit installation began with 200 mice; some, no doubt in a spirit of interactivity, were nicked. In one of the most disquieting yet powerful works, Return (2008), by Miami-based performance artist Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Arjona, the spectator steps though bloody puddles made by red ink, splattered at eye level around the walls of a ward, without knowing how the blood-like stains were formed. In the next ward, the performance artist repeats the child-like blowing of bubbles at the wall that created the effect, but this time with pure soap to expunge the horror. Later, in the gallery's sleek offices in a high-rise building in downtown Bogot\u00e1, the artist tells me, \"violence permeates and transforms everything.\"</p> <p>\"We think we can apply justice to it,\" Jos\u00e9 Arjona says, \"but institutions are the dirtiest places. I try to create resistance, to come back to innocence and transparency.\"<br> Some 2,000 people saw this exhibition in three weeks. Alcuadrado's shows are free, and its co-founder Juan Gallo Restrepo, who has lived in London and is an admirer of Charles Saatchi and the YBAs, says the gallery is breaking even owing to sales of artworks \u2013 more than half of which are to institutions including Tate Modern. There have been 15 exhibitions in five years. \"We're committed to showing work that shows the reality of this country,\" he says. Ironically enough, it may be the respite from urban terror of the past few years that has increased the audience for such art. Many of these artists grew up during a period of terrorist bombings in the cities, when drug cartels vied for control with the state and each other. The strong-arm \"democratic security\" policy of president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, in power since 2002, has made cities and main corridors safer. Yet in rural no-go areas, war continues. While the conservative government (accused of being involved in \"parapolitics\") claims that inroads against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and demobilisation of paramilitaries following a controversial amnesty, the US-backed crackdown on narco-traffic is a war few here believe can be won. Despite the high-profile rescue of the French-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and three kidnapped Americans (known here as the \"jewels in the crown\"), some 2,500 hostages are still held by the Farc and other groups. There is deep concern, and some resentment, that they may be forgotten.</p> <p>Such concerns are reflected in the art I saw. In the videos of Project for a Memorial (2005), the Cal\u00ed artist Oscar Mu\u00f1oz copies faces of the disappeared from news photographs, painting images with water on paving stones which vanish as the slabs dry. His frantic repetition evokes death, disappearance and the duty of memory in a losing battle with oblivion. In Miguel \u00c1ngel Rojas's 59-minute video Outline of Panic (2003), also in the show, the artist's latex-gloved hand forensically traces blood stains he found on a city pavement. Rojas earlier caused controversy with David (2005), a photographic installation of 12 images of a nude soldier with an amputated leg in the pose of Michelangelo's sculpture, first shown in a disused Hilton hotel in Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p><strong>As Juanes</strong>, Colombia's global rock star and anti-landmine campaigner, told me last year, three Colombians fall victim to landmines every day \u2013 the worst toll in the world. Juanes, a former heavy metal singer turned soulful rocker, lives in both Miami and Medell\u00edn, a town located north-west of Bogot\u00e1 in a temperate Andean valley.</p> <p>Medell\u00edn is also the hometown of South America's most famous artist, Fernando Botero, whose rotund sculptures dominate the square outside the Antioqu\u00eda museum, in a former town hall. But inside I find a startling exhibition on Displacement and Reparation, with almost 50 works, mainly by Colombian artists. An estimated 3.8 million Colombians are internally displaced \u2013 the largest such population outside Sudan \u2013 and their plight has a huge impact on big cities. Some sense a social timebomb. A group of <em>desplazados</em> recently occupied a park in affluent northern Bogot\u00e1, demanding money promised by the mayor. According to the museum's director of projects, Carolina Jaramillo Ferrer, \"people are blind to displacement - it's just a number. This is a way to open their eyes.\"<br> One work, Libia Posada's Cardinal Signs: Units of Measure (2008) consists of photographs of journeys mapped in ink on the legs of the <em>desplazados</em> who undertook them, many of whom are indigenous people. Other works question the official line that US-sponsored coca-eradication programmes cause no lasting damage to the land, saying that they are themselves a cause of displacement. Carlos Uribe's painting Horizons (1999) reproduces the heroic peasant couple of Francisco Antonio Cano's classic 1913 Colombian painting of the same title, but inserts a plane spraying defoliants into the pastoral idyll.</p> <p>Yet Jaramillo Ferrer also believes artists are taking stock of \"what we're losing on a cultural level \u2013 the richness of the heritage related to the land, which is sacred and irreplaceable.\" That sense of both loss and recovery echoes through the art.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.colombiage.com\">Colombiage</a>, a weekend festival of films, music and talks, is at <a href=\"http://www.riversidestudios.co.uk\">Riverside Studios</a>, London W6, on October 18-19 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Urgent action is required by the international community to avert the failure to achieve lasting stability and development in Afghanistan. As an aid agency which has been implementing rural livelihood programmes and supporting partner organisations in the country for close to 20 years, Oxfam has grave concerns about the current course of events.<br> Security conditions are worse than at any point since 2001 and there has been a spread of insecurity to previously stable areas, including provinces bordering Kabul. Militants have control or influence in swathes of the country, up to half of which is inaccessible for UN aid operations.  Threats and violence have forced the closure of hundreds of clinics and schools in the south, and increasing insurgent <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L05555153.htm\">attacks on aid agencies</a> have caused 28 deaths and are hampering development work. There has been a surge in civilian casualties caused by all sides, with more than 1,500 civilian deaths so far this year. <br> In the years immediately following the 2001 intervention in Afghanistan international resources and efforts were insufficient, uncoordinated and unevenly spread. Reforms in governance and the rule of law were sidelined and there has been a failure to learn from history or see the intervention through Afghan eyes. Despite some successes, including in health and education, overall progress has been slow. Still, one child in five dies before the age of five; average life expectancy is 45. Corruption is endemic and persists at all levels, which fuels public dissatisfaction, undermines government legitimacy and hampers service delivery. There is a severe lack of government capacity at local level, including in agriculture, the bedrock of Afghan livelihoods.  Foreign donors, including the UK, are providing vital and substantial assistance to Afghanistan. However, much foreign aid from international donors is inefficient, fragmented, has limited local impact, and a disproportionate share is allocated to the southern provinces which host international forces. </p> <p>Significant efforts are required in the south, but unless donors look to other parts of the country then insecurity will continue to spread. </p> <p>Too often donor countries prioritise their own national interests, concerns or geographical responsibilities with limited consideration of the bigger picture or developments on the ground.<br> As a result of a harsh winter, severe drought and high food prices there is an impending humanitarian crisis in parts of the country. Up to five million people face food shortages, of whom 1.8 million are at high risk, which could have serious public health implications and cause internal displacement.  Thus the future of Afghanistan hangs in the balance: the immediate priority is to address basic needs and contain the spread of insecurity.  To address urgent needs, donors should follow the lead of the UK, US and others by supporting the <a href=\"http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/LSGZ-7GDHQX?OpenDocument\">joint emergency appeal</a> for $404m, which is less than half funded. They should also support the rapid and substantial expansion of UN capacity both in Kabul and the provinces. <br> To increase food security and reduce vulnerability to disasters there needs to be major reform of the Afghan disaster management authority and ministry of agriculture.  Donors should commit to genuine coordination, full transparency, performance targets and rigorous monitoring. The US especially, as the largest donor, must seek to enhance the effectiveness of its aid, too much of which is dispensed by costly contracting companies. </p> <p>Rather than grand strategies, priority action plans should be established in key sectors, focusing on local-level impact. Rather than political patronage, effective sub-national governance reform must be expedited. <br> To achieve stability and respond to the minimum expectations of ordinary Afghans, concrete action against corruption is imperative. Mooted initiatives to empower tribes are high risk and no substitute for governance reforms and greater efforts to strengthen and professionalise the Afghan police and security forces. More must be done to end their abuses against civilians. Military forces must further reduce civilian casualties and for cases of alleged abuses there is an urgent need for transparent and unified mechanisms of monitoring, investigation, accountability and compensation.  There should be support for peace-building initiatives, especially at local level, where violent disputes often undermine stability and development and are exploited by militants in the wider conflict. Finally, given the strong links between Afghanistan and its neighbours in a range of spheres, including security, trafficking and population movements, a comprehensive regional approach is long overdue.

  "<p>A Spanish judge today ordered the grave of poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca be dug up as, for the first time ever, the violent repression unleashed by the dictator General Francisco Franco was formally declared a crime against humanity.</p> <p>In a highly controversial reversal of Spain's traditional refusal to seek out those responsible for the killings of Lorca and more than 100,000 other people, Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n also asked investigators to provide him with information on Franco's chief henchmen and generals.</p> <p>Franco and his chief collaborators, Garz\u00f3n said, had been responsible for \"mass killings, torture and the systematic, general and illegal detentions of political opponents\".</p> <p>Death squads, military courts and other tribunals sent 114,000 people to their deaths during and after a three-year civil war in the 1930s that traumatised Spain for generations, according to the judge.</p> <p>Several thousand of the dead still lie in unmarked mass graves, despite the attempts of volunteers over the past eight years to disinter corpses and hand them over to relatives for reburial.</p> <p>The judge ordered the digging up of 19 such graves, including one on a hillside overlooking the southern city of Granada where Lorca is thought to have been shot in 1936.</p> <p>Lorca's family do not want the poet exhumed but they recently promised not to oppose a petition from relatives of two men shot and buried alongside him for the grave to be dug up.</p> <p>\"I'm very pleased. I've been waiting ten years for this,\" said the granddaughter of one of them, Nieves Galindo.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n also requested formal proof that 35 generals and Francoist ministers had passed away, and he ordered the interior ministry to provide a list of those in charge of the pro-Francoist Falange movement up until 1951. It is doubtful, however, that any are still alive.</p> <p>The judge explictly said that his investigations included repression carried out until 1952, seventeen years after Franco had won the Spanish civil war and established his dictatorship.</p> <p>Many Spaniards still find the civil war period hard to talk about, and some fear Garz\u00f3n's investigation will reopen old wounds.</p> <p>Spain's political right has been highly critical of the judge and of a recent \"historical memory\" law to help Franco's victims passed by the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's socialist government.</p> <p>An unwritten \"pact of forgetting\", in which both sides agreed not to rake over the coals of the war, underpinned Spain's successful and rapid transition to democracy after Franco's death in 1975.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n's critics claim all civil war and Franco-era repression is covered by a 1977 amnesty law and by rules which mean that most crimes lapsed after a 20-year period.<br>Garz\u00f3n declared today, however, that where a victim's body had not been found a crime of kidnapping was still being committed and had not lapsed.</p> <p>Spain's attorney general's office, which has opposed the judge's investigation, was expected to appeal against the decision. It has previously argued that international human rights laws do not apply to the civil war as Spain was not signed up to them at the time.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has previously investigated the repression carried out by military regimes in Latin America in the 1970s. In 1998 he ordered the arrest of Chile's General Augusto Pinochet while he was in London, but failed to get him extradited to face trial in Spain.</p> <p>Spanish courts have been criticised for investigating crimes committed by other dictatorships without ever looking at those carried out under Franco.</p>",
  "<p>The Healthcare Commission has clearly sworn an oath to tell some of the whole truth and nothing but some of the whole truth in its annual review of NHS performance released today. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/16/nhs-health\">annual health check</a> says the NHS is performing better than ever. There are small concessions that things like hygiene must improve, but implies we should celebrate the fact that patients are seen 18 weeks after a GP referral. </p> <p>But not all waiting times are actually measured. If you're referred for psychological 'talking' therapies for a condition like depression or schizophrenia you'd be lucky to be seen within six months. Some people wait two years. And just like a physical condition that festers away getting worse when not treated, a mental health condition will also spiral. <br> The consequences of not getting help in time are broken relationships, more time off work or long-term unemployment, <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/?entryid5=6249&amp;EntryId5=62260&amp;char=W\">according to a mental health charity coalition called We Need to Talk</a>. <br> And the case for psychological therapies is clear - they can help <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org/living_with_mental_illness/treatment_and_therapy/index.html\">prevent hospital admissions and reduce relapses</a>, for people with moderate conditions and more severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has been recommending psychological therapies for people with a range of mental illnesses for years \u2013 but 68% of people with schizophrenia aren't getting this treatment, <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org\">Rethink</a> has discovered. <br> So psychological therapies are proven effective and in the long-term reduce costs. They ought to qualify for the 'gold star' rating from the Healthcare Commission, a \"double excellence score\". And they could benefit thousands \u2013 one in four of us will have a mental health problem at some stage. Yet psychological therapies continue to be treated as a side issue. Even the new millions of government investment will only reach people with anxiety and depression, rather than everyone with mental illness. The only option for hundreds of thousands with severe mental illness is to pay from their own pocket \u2013 during the credit crunch.  This will be the last report from the Healthcare Commission: a new watchdog is set to take over monitoring the NHS. If it wants to gain a realistic overview of NHS performance on all health conditions it must look at all waiting times, for all conditions \u2013 and not selectively exclude mental illness from the picture.  \u2022 Paul Corry is director of Rethink</p>",
  "<p>Two police marksmen who mistakenly shot Jean Charles de Menezes were put in an \"impossible situation\" and should not have been left with the decision to open fire, the inquest into his death was told today.</p> <p>A senior firearms adviser, known only as Trojan 84, agreed with Michael Mansfield QC, who is representing the De Menezes family, that events and information were \"concertina'd\" together in the hours leading up to the shooting.</p> <p>\"They were given the judgment call and that is unbelievably outrageous, that they should be left with that responsibility,\" Trojan 84 said. \"I think you're absolutely right in that the concertina-ing of all the information I'm sure had a huge part in the outcome.\"</p> <p>Trojan 84 told the inquest at The Oval cricket ground, south London, that the men had been put in an ''invidious position'' on the day of the shooting.</p> <p>He strongly denied a suggestion that the marksmen were \"intent on shooting a person dead without any further assessment\" when they entered Stockwell tube station. </p> <p>\"They would never have had that state of mind at that point, that they were going to shoot somebody,\" he said.</p> <p>De Menezes, 27, a Brazilian electrician working in London, was shot seven times in the head by police marksmen after being mistaken for a suicide bomber as he boarded a tube train at Stockwell, south London, on July 22 2005.</p> <p>He had been followed by surveillance officers from his home in Tulse Hill, south London, from a block of flats associated with Hussain Osman, the failed suicide bomber who had attempted an attack on a train the previous day at Shepherds Bush station in west London. Police incorrectly identified De Menezes as Osman.</p> <p>Detective chief inspector Greg Purser, who was in command of the operation at the block of flats, told the inquest he had suggested to Cressida Dick, in charge of the operation from Scotland Yard, that Menezes should be allowed to continue to lead police to the other 21 July bombers, who were at large. </p> <p>\"I just thought it was something to be raised, and she dismissed it robustly,\" he said.</p> <p>The inquest also heard that there was no code word for a control room commander to use to order a critical or lethal shot. Trojan 84 said he expected the words \"critical shot authorised\" to be used if required, which did not happen.</p> <p>Mansfield said there had been a \"mad rush\" at the end of the operation as police ran after De Menezes on to the underground train. </p> <p>The police marksmen who fired the fatal shots, known only as C2 and C12, are due to give evidence in public for the first time later in the inquest.</p>",
  "<p>Giovanni Trapattoni suggested Andy Reid was a creative luxury that he could not afford at present, as he sought to draw a line today under the controversy which has accompanied the midfielder's exclusion from his Republic of Ireland team.</p> <p>The manager has laid down solid defensive foundations, in the shape of two screening central midfielders in front of a back four, and he is fearful that tinkering with the system to accommodate Reid's more expansive talents might unbalance the side.</p> <p>There have been sustained calls for the Sunderland player's inclusion, as he is considered to be the most naturally gifted passer of the ball in the squad. But Trapattoni preferred the physical presence of the young Manchester United reserve Darron Gibson alongside Stoke City's Glenn Whelan in the 1-0 win over Cyprus on Wednesday night, as he sought to fill the hole created by the knee injury to Steven Reid of Blackburn Rovers.</p> <p>He admitted that Gibson was overawed by the occasion and that there were \"difficulties\" in central midfield during an edgy 90 minutes. But he remains convinced that he has sufficient offensive threat in his wingers Aiden McGeady and Damien Duff and the strikers Robbie Keane and Kevin Doyle, while his critics lack the ammunition of poor results. Trapattoni's team have taken seven points from an available nine to sit second in World Cup qualifying group eight, four points clear of third-placed Bulgaria.</p> <p>\"I have nothing against any player, they are all like my children,\" said Trapattoni. \"I just want a solid team with a good balance. You have to be solid. Andy [Reid] has very good qualities but not necessarily what we need.</p> <p>\"I know that if we get to the point where our team dominates the game and we have the right balance then, of course, Andy can be very useful to us. This particular position only works if we are playing the ball, but if we are under pressure then this particular type of play doesn't work. I can't turn someone into a worker. I can't turn someone into a craftsman if that is not his job.\"</p> <p>Trapattoni dropped the names of some illustrious playmakers, including Milan's Ronaldinho, to reinforce his point. The Brazilian, he insisted, would only fit into his current system when the team were in control. Similarly, Reid would blend easily into one of the leading passing sides in Europe.</p> <p>\"I was always at big teams that won everything,\" Trapattoni added with a smile. \"Perhaps I am used to teams that have too many players. Perhaps I shouldn't stay here in Ireland, perhaps I should go back to Italy.\"</p> <p>Trapattoni was reported to have had a confrontation with Reid after the victory over Georgia last month but the feeling persists that the player's problems began much earlier. Reid was among a host of senior players who did not attend the week-long training camp in Portugal in May, when Trapattoni first took charge.</p> <p>\"The seniors didn't come to Portugal, I had the opportunity to see new players and I've been able to build a team that has a certain balance,\" said Trapattoni. \"It's not easy to immediately find solid bases on which to build and I need to stick to what I've found. I have to be coherent. There is a philosopher who says if you are too coherent, you run the risk of being an idiot but I can't keep changing. I didn't get the chance to try him [Reid] out in Portugal. Now, it's qualify, qualify, qualify. I can't gamble.\"</p> <p>Trapattoni shares the fear of many within the game that Steven Reid's cartilage problem could keep him out for the longer term and, consequently, he has considered several options in the centre of midfield. Worryingly for Andy Reid, it was Blackburn's Keith Andrews who enjoyed a prominent name check when the friendly with Poland next month was mentioned.</p> <p>\"I know that the injury [to Steven Reid] was very, very dangerous and I look at other players,\" said Trapattoni. \"Andrews is strong, physical but also a good footballer. The next game, maybe I look at him in there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Foreigners talking loudly about moving to Canada should \"President McCain-Palin\" or \"Prime Minister Cameron\" come to pass, take heed. My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/15/canada-labour\">beloved country</a> has just held a pointless <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4951468.ece\">election</a>, a real doughnut, and made a fool of itself, courtesy of its <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7670934.stm\">prime minister</a>. </p> <p>Oh God, I am so embarrassed.</p> <p>I'm taking the Canadian flag off my luggage tag and telling everyone I'm from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/iceland-banking\">Iceland</a>. Now there's a shy puss of a country that screws up with elan.</p> <p>Is there some way I can blame George W Bush for Canada's humiliation? You betcha, as Sarah Palin would say. </p> <p>Our prime minister, Stephen Harper, a strange man with an awkward gait, an absence of social skills, and the dress sense of that guy at the back of the hardware store who sorts nails for a living, is alone in this world in that he still adores Bush. Just as the US is about to turf the man who brought them a disastrous war, Alp-sized deficits and an economic collapse that would give Herbert Hoover pause, Harper this week tried to turn his minority government into a majority one that would transform <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199929/\">Canada into Bushworld</a>, eight years after it was fashionable.</p> <p>He failed. And he <a href=\"http://thestar.blogs.com/bigpicture/2008/10/so-what-was-the.html\">failed with stasis</a>, which is worse. </p> <p>There are three wings to Canadian political life. Harper, the Conservative PM, is a rightwing extremist, although he doesn't suck up like Cameron. He is an anti-choice, pro-prison, poverty-ignoring, food-safety-privatising, arts-ridiculing, Afghanistan war-loving, cowboy hat-wearing guy. </p> <p>The Liberals, the nation's natural rulers, are in the middle of the road like an expiring woodchuck. They are sensible people without passion; they own just the one house; they're New Labour without the ratlike cunning, without the Cherie, shall we say. The New Democratic party is old Labour.</p> <p>Harper began passing laws making Canada more like the States. His most complimentary adjective was \"CEO-like\". He wants life sentences for 14-year-old murderers, of whom we have maybe three in a nation of 33 million citizens. He wants to build more prisons, ban safe-injection sites for heroin addicts, privatise universal healthcare, make the foetus not just a person, but someone who can dress for success \u2013 you know the drill. </p> <p>And then he passed a law saying election dates had to be fixed, just like in the States. Weird, Canadians thought, but the governor-general can handle that.</p> <p>Suddenly last month, he thought he was sufficiently buff to win an election big-time, so he broke his own new law to call one. A week later, the world economic system collapsed. </p> <p>Canadians worry. We are still hewers of wood and drawers of water, but the spruce pine beetle is destroying our forests. And the Americans want our water to fill the fountains of Las Vegas. They have drones, we don't: they'll have our water.</p> <p>So if we're going down, if we're going to lose our jobs and move back in with our parents and spend a slate-grey winter watching Canadian Idol, we'd really rather not have a prime minister who, when confronted with his own small child at his school, reaches down and shakes the child's hand. We'd like a human being in charge. Hey, maybe someone who gets all emotional about mothers fretting at kitchen tables and such, like the Democrats have. Where's our Obama? </p> <p>Oh quit dreaming, Canadians. </p> <p>So we voted. As in the movie Groundhog Day, where the post-election morning was the same as the last one, with the result being another minority government born of a quiet desperation that won't be soothed until the Liberals get a new leader, not a sweet smart guy like St\u00e9phane Dion, but someone with claws like Michael Ignatieff, a Canadian you Brits took to your bosom some years ago.</p> <p>Thanks for sending him back. It's getting hot here, our trees are sawdust and our ice is melting. Canada needs a smart decisive cynic. Anything to haul that crushed woodchuck off the road.</p>",
  "<p>So where's the \"voter fraud\"? <br> Fox News, and its Rupert Murdoch-owned print brethren, the New York Post, continue to bang the <a href=\"http://bradblog.com/ACORN\">GOP's phony Acorn \"voter fraud\" drum</a>, but as far as I can tell, they've failed to come up with a single incident of any actual voter fraud committed by those dastardly \"left-wing extremists\".<br> Yes, Conservative firebrand <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/CoulterFraud\">Ann Coulter has committed voter fraud</a>, but neither of the Murdoch outfits seem to report on that, even as they go wall-to-wall with misleading reports claiming that the community organization, <a href=\"http://acorn.org\">Acorn</a> is committing massive \"voter fraud\" on behalf of the Democrats.<br> So, as it's now been revealed that <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6508\">John McCain himself was a keynote speaker at a 2006 Acorn rally</a> in Florida, where he declared the group's volunteers to be \"what makes America special\", and as I've been going back and forth with commenters on my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/election-acorn-voter-fraud\">\"Republican Voter Fraud Hoax\" piece</a> earlier this week at the Guardian, nobody seems able to show me an instance of any actual voter fraud committed by Acorn, or even anybody who registered via Acorn.<br> Those who wish to believe in the hoax, however, attempt to link to article after article about allegations of voter fraud carried out by Acorn. And yet, the articles themselves - if one bothers to actually read them - reveal that either 1) They describe allegations and investigations brought by Republican agents, with little or no evidence of any wrong doing, and certainly no \"voter fraud\" 2) Where voter registration fraud has occurred it has been by rogue Acorn employees, originally reported to authorities by Acorn themselves, or 3) Smoke and mirrors are used to cloud the fact that not a single fraudulent vote has actually been cast by anyone associated or registered by Acorn. Let's look at just two recent, oft-linked, oft-quoted New York Post articles from Tuesday and last week to give you an idea of how the scam works and how the rightwing suckers fall for it, apparently, every time. Yesterday, the Post ran an article headlined: <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10132008/news/nationalnews/4_000_shady_sign_ups_133443.htm\">\"4,000 Shady Sign-Ups: Bogus Voter Booted Amid Probe of Acorn\"</a>.<br> The story is cited by one gullible chump after another in comments at Coulter-wannabe Michelle Malkin's site where <a href=\"http://michellemalkin.com/2008/10/14/acorn-watch-rico-suit-filed-in-ohio/\">she reports</a> on former Ohio Republican Secretary of State <a href=\"http://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/scholars.php\">Ken Blackwell's rightwing outfit</a> in Ohio. They've decided to file a \"conspiracy\" suit against Acorn. Malkin, by the way, is the same woman who also <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200410270005\">falsely reported</a>, just days before the 2004 election in Ohio, that Acorn was registering terrorists to vote there. So this days-before-the-election scam is <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/Docs/PoliticsofVoterFraudFinal.pdf\">not a new one [pdf]</a> for the GOP. It's just being trumped up this year more than ever.<br> Tuesday's New York Post article is accompanied by a huge photo of a snarling, street-lookin' black dude who claims to \"have signed 73 voter registration forms for Acorn\", according to the caption along with it. The story's lead reported: \"An Ohio man who registered to vote several times cast a bogus ballot with a fake address in a vote-fraud case stemming from Acorn, officials said today\" and notes that Darnell Nash \"had registered to vote repeatedly from an address that belonged to an actual registered voter.\" Voter fraud, right? Well, right. But Acorn had nothing to do with it, and you have to read carefully to notice. The story goes on to explain that the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections \"had been in contact with Nash since the summer, and informed him he had to stop repeat registering.\" So the Board of Elections already knew about the problem with this voter months ago. They were already given information about his fraudulent registrations as turned in, and flagged by Acorn, as the organization must do, by law, even after confirming in their quality control process that the registration is problematic in some way. Yet, the story hits Murdoch's Post today, days before the election, amidst a flurry of ginned-up Fox News panic about Acorn \"voter fraud\". Go figure. But the Mickey Mouse nature of the argument becomes more apparent, as the article goes on to quote Cuyahoga Election Director Jane Platten: \"He came in on September 30 and Mr. Nash again registered to vote at [someone else's] address, and he cast a ballot\". So Nash did commit voter fraud, it was caught by officials, and it had nothing to do with Acorn, as Nash registered himself at the county's Board of Elections. Of course, had Nash tried to vote under the registration(s) he filed with Acorn, he would not have been able to vote, since federal law - the Help America Vote Act of 2002 - requires that ID must be shown, when voting the first time, by anybody who hadn't registered in person originally. On that grounds, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Mary Poppins and all the other Disney characters the disingenuous Republicans like to point to as having been \"registered by Acorn\", would not be able to vote either, unless they could prove they were actually Mickey, Donald or Mary. The Post even goes on to describe how the bi-partisan members of the Cuyahoga County election board, \"downplayed any voter fraud\", and how Acorn has been instrumental in helping them to ferret out fraud of any type, by anybody. The election commissioners \"insisted that officials with Acorn have offered any and all help in probing the questionable activities,\" and notes that Acorn has \"fired anyone who was found soliciting duplicate registrations\". \"If one of the 13,000 [people] we hired is potentially a bad apple in the bunch, we encourage the authorities to prosecute as appropriate or anyone that did the wrong thing. We discipline, [and] we fire workers who [abuse their position] ... we encourage prosecutors to follow suit,\" said Acorn adviser Scott Levenson. Levenson \"also strenuously denied suggestions that the group pays canvassers by the number of names they sign up, and that they have quotas,\" which has been otherwise misreported by many, even as a quick check of <a href=\"http://www.acorn.org/index.php?id=12439&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=22384&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=12346&amp;cHash=369dbd64b5\">Acorn's fact sheets</a> note that \"Our canvassers are paid by the hour, not by the card,\" and that \"Acorn has a zero-tolerance policy for deliberately falsifying registrations, and in the cases where our internal quality controls have identified this happening we have fired the workers involved and turned them in to election officials and law-enforcement\".<br> Just to be certain, since that point has been so often misreported, I checked myself with Acorn's communication's director, Charles D. Jackson, who told me via email: \"We don't have a quota system. We have a performance standard system based on the quality of the cards, which includes complete cards, phone numbers, good phone numbers, but it's not based on quota. No one has been fired for not completing a number of cards. The number of cards turned in per day have ranged from 12-25, 10-15. Some canvassers turned in between 1-5 cards, and were not terminated. We terminate people when they falsify cards, turn in too many incomplete cards, and consistent bad phone numbers\". So, no Acorn voter fraud in today's much-linked-by-rightwingers New York Post article \u2013 if you actually bother to pay attention.  But the Republicans are desperate to come up with something, anything, that may offer them an advantage at the polls \u2013 now, on Election Day or thereafter in legal challenges \u2013 and seem willing to say and do anything to continue the <a href=\"http://truthaboutfraud.org/\">myth of Democratic voter fraud</a>, particularly by those Acorn \"leftists\" who had the temerity to <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6503\">sign up some 1.3 million</a> low-income (and thus, Democratic-leaning) voters over the past two years.<br> But, how about last week's story, linked up all over the web, and used by Murdoch's Fox News to help kick off the phony frenzy? That one was headlined <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/10102008/news/politics/1_voter__72_registrations_132965.htm\">\"1 Voter, 72 Registrations: 'Acorn Paid Me in Cash &amp; Cigs\"</a>.<br> There's our man Freddie pictured again (apparently he must have registered one more time since this original October 10 report, as Tuesday's Post piece notes he registered 73 times.) And what did that original Post article tell us, as reported by Murdoch's paper, on the same day that the <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6487\">RNC released a Fox News transcript</a> on all of this, verbatim, as an official party press release? That article details how Freddie claims to have been pressured to register 72 times, over an 18-month period, by Acorn canvassers, to fill out registration forms in Cuyahoga County.<br> But note this quickly mentioned point in the report: \"Johnson used the same information on all of his registration cards, and officials say they usually catch and toss out duplicate registrations.\" In other words, Johnson registered to vote, 72 times, at the same address. That, of course, would allow Freddie to cast exactly 1 vote. And before casting it, he'd have to show ID confirming he was who he registered as, and that he lived at that address, as per federal law. Firing up the GOP base, playing to their worst nightmares and darkest (self) instincts, in hopes of wreaking havoc at the polls, knocking folks off the voter rolls and challenging them on Election Day and beyond is all that matters to Republicans. They seem to have no interest in the tens of thousands of legal voters who have illegally been purged from the rolls <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">as reported late last week by the New York Times</a>, or the tens of thousands purged in other states <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/politics/09voting.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all\">as reported by CBS News</a> the week before.<br> The once-honourable John McCain knows it, but it didn't stop him from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCB-wGSRzVc\">parroting</a> the same \"voter fraud\" garbage on the stump last week. And Sarah Palin (probably) knows it, but it didn't stop the RNC from sending out a fundraising email in her name on Monday, declaring, \"We can't allow leftist groups like Acorn to steal this election.\"<br> If she believes what the RNC wrote for her, Palin would do well then to call out her her running mate, McCain, for \"palling around with\" those \"left-wing activists\" two years ago, when <a href=\"http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6508\">he lauded them</a> while serving as their keynote speaker at that 2006 rally in Florida.<br> So again I ask: where's the voter fraud?</p>",
  "<p>The image of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pushkin\">Alexander Sergevitch Pushkin</a>, the great Russian writer, is shot through with contradiction. Born an aristocrat, he became a rebel and an exile. Perpetually taunted about having the features of a monkey, he ended his life as a revered icon of Russian and European culture. His place in the history of the black diaspora is ambiguous, but he referred frequently to his African blood and his \"negro\" temperament; and even a casual study of his work and letters reveals the extent to which his African background was part of his personal trajectory. </p> <p>When I first encountered Pushkin I knew vaguely about his African ancestry, but I was not at the time interested in much outside of his poetry, because I was, more or less, taken up with my own struggle to work out what made his work unique and special in European literature. Apart from anything else I couldn't see him as anything but a Russian. \"Blackness\", in my mind, was something to do being a colonial and part of the imperialist legacy.</p> <p>By the time I visited Russia, more than a dozen years ago, my grip on black identity had changed, but I still hadn't \"got\" Pushkin. Driving across Europe, though, and arriving in Moscow on my first visit to Russia, it hit me that I hadn't seen another black person since Berlin. I felt a kind of panic, which intensified that night when I was followed down the embankment by a group of men in cars. I couldn't understand everything they were shouting, but it certainly wasn't \"Welcome, dear foreign guest.\" </p> <p>I went to see Pushkin's statue in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushkin_Square\">square named after him</a> next morning, and standing in front of it I felt, somehow, a sort of comradeship, as if I was greeting a friend. Reflecting on the isolation I was feeling it struck me how extraordinary he must have been to sustain, throughout his life and in that icy landscape, the fierceness of his challenge to an all-powerful authority. </p> <p>How brave he must have been to flourish his pride in himself and his family. How full of passion he must have been to maintain the defiance with which he confronted insult and provocation. How brilliant he must have been to reinvent Russian poetry, and to represent identity in an idiom which made him the champion of an immense slice of the world's population. In that moment I thought of him as a hero, and in the ensuing years I have begun to read and understand the various meanings of his work for my own life and times. </p> <p>Say the words \"black hero\" and you automatically think of a figure who played a prominent part in confronting slavery, colonialism or racism. This confrontation, over and over again, has also been used to reinforce a definition of black identity as occupying the space where \"whiteness\" leaves off. </p> <p>What is interesting about Pushkin is the fact that his life and work remains a towering achievement in European culture, while his legacy continues to defy incorporation into the ideology of race. </p> <p>The great grandson of Abrahim, a sub-Saharan African, Pushkin's own mother disliked his swarthy appearance and flat nose. He established a reputation as a poet, a brilliant man of letters, and a dangerous rebel, with a streak of wildness.</p> <p>By the time Pushkin was killed, in a duel, he had established enduring fame as the Russian genius who could be talked about in the same breath as Shakespeare and Byron. Grief at the news of his death was unprecedented and the secret police saw it as so threatening that every effort was made to play down public mourning. In a repressive century, the poet was viewed for decades as a threat to public order and a source of dangerous ideas. </p> <p>His heroism, and his importance as a black historical figure, consists of the fact that he refused the limitations of his origins. Instead, he took the world in which he found himself and changed it forever.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Southend. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Michael Webster (vocals, guitars), Simon Bellamy (guitar, vocals), Danny Rowton (bass, vocals), Jim Webster (drums, vocals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Baddies, who only formed 18 months ago and have already gained a reputation as one of the most exciting new bands around, yada yada, were one of the buzz bands (can't believe we just said \"buzz bands\") at Manchester's In The City. They come from Southend, in the wake of acts as varied as the Horrors, These New Puritans, Scroobius Pip and Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly, acts, indeed, way too varied to be corralled into anything remotely resembling a homogenous \"scene\". That said, they do remind us in a way of Switches, a Southend outfit who we did as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/02/popandrock7\">New Band of the Day last year</a> and whose infectious glam stomp'n'roll should have achieved wider success. <br> But mostly, Baddies bear trace elements of a variety of groups from all corners of the globe, although we can't quite fathom the references early supporters have been making to Talking Heads. Baddies are far scratchier and punkier than that, and there's very little funk in what they do. They're a white indie band, through and through. Well, it's not a crime. Yet. The \"woo woo woo woo's you can hear on their debut single Battleships are pure Blur circa Song 2. At the Party has the thrust and parry of Hives. Who Are You? has the phlegmatic urgency of early Manic Street Preachers, with a semi-rapped middle bit that makes us think of Adam &amp; the Ants, while Tiffany I'm Sorry and Open One Eye could have been the sixth and seventh singles lifted off that first Kaiser Chiefs album, so relentlessly do they drill their hooks into your brain.  Warning: it's Baddies, not the Baddies, and although they sound quite rough and tough, we're not sure how far they're prepared to take their aversion to the definite article in case you were thinking of getting it wrong in front of them, just to wind them up, like. Mind you, the singer used to front a metal band called Engerica, which sounds quite scary and intimidating. Then again, they wear matching blue suits onstage and Alexander McQueen, the self-styled \"hooligan of English fashion\", is apparently a huge fan and is poised \u2013 very poised, knowing him \u2013 to dress Baddies, so they can't be that bad, or hard. Their music is, though \u2013 hard, that is, not bad \u2013 full of muscular riffs and meaty choruses, delivered energetically and with a determination to encourage audiences to work up a sweat. If that sort of thing turns you on.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Switching between twisted pop sensibilities that scream Talking Heads and a bass-driven heft that takes more than a little from Queens of the Stone Age.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Baddies could well end up with a hit, but they'll do it the old-fashioned way \u2013 building an audience by sheer hard gigging and graft. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Team up with 70s comedy trio the Goodies.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Team up with 80s teen-pop goddess Tiffany.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut single Battleships b/w Block It Out is released by YoYo Acapulco on November 3. Baddies play at Camden's Barfly on October 27. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Queens of the Stone Age, Rocket from the Crypt, Iglu &amp; Hartley, Kaiser Chiefs. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/baddies\">www.myspace.com/baddies</a>. </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Laura Izibor.</p>",
  "<p>Roughly 50,000 16- to 19-year-olds are at risk of dropping out of education after problems with the education maintenance allowance (EMA) the National Union of Students warned today.</p> <p>Some 90,000 young learners are still waiting for their EMA applications to be processed after technical problems with the company administering them, Liberata.</p> <p>Over half (61%) of the 16- to 19-year-olds that get up to \u00a330 a week from the government to stay on in education could not afford to continue studying without it, according to the NUS survey, published today.</p> <p>According to the report: \"The importance of learner support for young people in further education cannot be overstated.</p> <p>\"Regular, guaranteed income allows many of them to continue their studies by covering the costs of essentials such as travel, books and food.\"</p> <p>The NUS warned that government plans to reform or scrap the EMAs under moves to raise the education and training leaving age to 18 would deny young people learner support.</p> <p>\"Our findings starkly demonstrate how critical the EMA is, with 61% of recipients, when asked if they could continue to study without it, saying they could not.</p> <p>\"This rose to 65% amongst learners receiving the maximum rate of \u00a330, who come from the lowest-income background,\" the report said.</p> <p>One third of students find the EMA application process difficult, often because of the bureaucratic nature of the form, or because they lacked support from family members or others, the NUS found.</p> <p>Income assessment does not provide a fair way of dealing with certain circumstances, such as situations where there is more than one claimant in the family, or where the family has several dependant children, and nor is it able to adequately respond to changes in learners' circumstances, it said.</p> <p>Learners lack faith in the appeals process and find difficulties with the administration of the scheme and the accuracy of attendance records.</p> <p>Some 40% of the poorest learners said the EMA was not enough to cover their essential costs and that this group was more likely to use commercial debt to cover this shortfall. </p> <p>The report called on the government to increase the rate of the EMA by inflation each year for all students and consider introducing a higher London and south-east rate.</p> <p>It called on the Learning and Skills Council and colleges to help students with the application process and amend the income assessment to take into account multiple learners in one family.</p> <p>Beth Walker, NUS vice-president (further education), said: \"The EMA is a vital source of day-to-day support for hundreds of thousands of students in further education.</p> <p>\"This report makes it clear that without this form of student support, the majority could no longer continue studying and would be forced drop out.\"</p> <p>Walker said the delays to processing EMA applications were \"totally unacceptable\" and students should not be put at risk with \"bad contracts, shoddy procedures and ropey technology\".</p> <p>\"Every year, students have to struggle through unwieldy levels of bureaucracy to obtain the EMA,\" she added. \"This report shows the challenges they face, while reminding anyone who was in any doubt of how important this form of student support is to keeping young people in education.\"</p> <p>Walker called for a full investigation into the delays, echoing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/13/1419education-furthereducation\">calls by the shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove</a>, this week.<br></p>",

  "<p>Europe's leaders know where they want to be when it comes to tackling global warming. The problem is they don't know how to get there.</p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, running a two-day summit of EU leaders which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/16/climatechange-carbonemissions\">ended in Brussels today</a>, hoped to propel Europe towards a December deal. Instead, he has set the stage for a Christmas showdown.</p> <p>It's the 20/20/20 vision, as they say in Brussels when referring to the aim and the deadline. The idea, according to the programme drafted by the European commission and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/10/eu.greenpolitics\">endorsed by all 27 leaders</a> at another summit in March last year, is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% on 1990 levels by 2020 and for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jan/23/climatechange.eu1\">20% of Europe's energy mix to come from renewable sources</a> by the same date.</p> <p>That's the end. And the means? Four pieces of European legislation that turn the aims into legally binding commitments and a highly complex system of \"burden-sharing\" between 27 countries detailing what each country has to do to enable Europe as a whole to meet the renewables target.</p> <p>The heart of the system, hailed by European leaders last year as pioneering, radical, and exemplary, is the European <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/emissionstrading\">emissions trading system</a> (ETS) which compels companies and industries to buy permits to pollute at auction, thus providing them with incentives to save cash by cleaning up their acts. This is to supply the bulk of the carbon dioxide cuts.</p> <p>Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, Manuel Barroso et al argued today that the goals were sacrosanct, that the summit's success was to reaffirm adherence to the 20/20/20 targets and not to let the December deadline for a deal slip.</p> <p>But anything less would have been a disgrace, turning Europe's leaders into a laughing stock, and shattering the chances of Europe leading the way to a post-Kyoto global programme at an international conference in Copenhagen a little more than a year from now.</p> <p>The devil is in the detail. The gigantic exercise in horsetrading is already being wrecked by special pleading everywhere you look. And two big things have taken place and shaken resolve since the outline pact was agreed last year - first the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globalrecession\">financial meltdown</a> morphing into a broader European slump is feeding the feeling that Europe will simply not be able to put its money where its mouth is on climate change; secondly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/biofuels\">biofuels</a> (which under the scheme are supposed to supply 10% of all road transport fuel by 2020) are now seen, for at least the next 15 years, as being part of the problem rather than the solution.</p> <p>Step up Silvio Berlusconi. The Italian leader can always be relied upon to supply the drama, tragic or comic. \"I did not sign up for this last year because I wasn't prime minister,\" he told Wednesday evening's dinner. So count Italy out. \"Our companies are in no condition to take on costs like those we thought about last year.\" </p> <p>Then eight new-ish EU countries in central Europe, led by Poland, voiced their distress, deploying the v-word. Poland would veto, said Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister in Warsaw. They were being penalised for being highly dependent on dirty coal. They would end up being hooked on Russian energy supplies and vulnerable to political blackmail. They want the costs entailed in the burden-sharing to be weighted more towards wealthy western Europe.</p> <p>The Poles and the Italians were the main whingers at the summit. But they are in good company. The mighty German car industry is aghast at the prospect of being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/09/transport.greentech\">forced to cut CO2 emissions</a> by around 17% within three years for every new car.</p> <p>And in the scheme for trading in pollution permits, there are widespread fears that Europe will simply export jobs and industries to cheaper and less regulated parts of the world without affecting climate change one jot.</p> <p>This is so-called \"carbon leakage\" arising from energy-intensive industries such as cement, steel, and aluminium complaining they will be disadvantaged towards rivals outside Europe by having to pay for the permits. The French and the Germans want to give them their permits for free. Few others agree.</p> <p>Sarkozy has got 10 weeks to broker a deal. If he fails, the new laws won't be in place by next spring. They will have to await a new European parliament elected next summer, a new European commission appointed next autumn. Europe's credibility will be in tatters.</p>",

Nothing particularly newsworthy about that, since theme park rides have been made out of movies for aeons, and occasionally the other way around - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96386/pirates.of.the.caribbean\">for better</a> or, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/eddiemurphy\">Eddie Murphy</a> is involved, <a href=\"http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0338094/trivia\">worse</a>.</p> <p>A disclaimer here. This is not going to be a post about hee-hee-larious <a href=\"http://daily.greencine.com/archives/000122.html\">rides we'd like to see made out of films</a>, since this has been <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_15011_10-movie-based-theme-park-rides-wed-like-see.html\">done to death</a>. Though I have to admit I was impressed by <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/forum/fb.asp?m=2065270&amp;NID=23407\">a comment on the Empire forum</a> asking, \"What's next?

But are we so inured to thrills that rollercoasters now need to rely on a film franchise for extra frisson?</p> <p>Saw's an interesting, if commercially obvious, choice: the idea of being locked in a contraption which could cause your death seems a great fit. The personal, psychological and physical sacrifices required to escape <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigsaw_Killer\">Jigsaw</a>'s traps are missing, admittedly (unless you count losing control of your bladder in front of friends/family/strangers), as is the personal development that they were designed to provoke (unless you count the post-coaster rush of endorphins).</p> <p>By extension, I'd like to know what sin you'd need to have committed to deserve waking up in a stupor, strapped into the Saw ride with a Dictaphone gaffer-taped to your hand. Certainly, the ride's video promo utterly fails to be frightening. In many ways, it undermines the scariest scenes of the films - when Jigsaw's victims first come round and have the nature of their predicament explained to them. Yay for advertising!</p> <p>But in case you're thinking there's nothing frightening about a cheesy rollercoaster with a 100-foot drop at 100 degrees, cast an eye over the fatalities in the news archives at <a href=\"http://www.rideaccidents.com/\">www.rideaccidents.com</a>. That should add to the experience in a way that a movie never will.</p> <p>\u2022 Any plans for Halloween?

  "<p>International talks on the future of the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h4-tWFI-anlmK7ShA_zWkvtcCUqA\">crumbled yesterday in Geneva</a>. Diplomats, journalists and experts lingered in the hallways, not awaiting a breakthrough, but observing Russia's cynical mise-en-scene. Moscow's plan was simple: insist that the world accept what it refuses to accept \u2013 treatment of the two Georgian territories as independent \u2013 and thereby bust the conference.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Natia and her four children shared a simple meal in a government-owned flat near the Tbilisi Airport. In August, Russian-backed separatists hounded them from their home in Upper Abkhazia.</p> <p>I do not believe that westerners do not care. Rather, they are confused by misinformation and superficial analysis such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/georgia-russia\">Anna Matveeva's October 14 article</a> on Comment is free.</p> <p>Western policy, she writes, \"should be based not on fiction, but on the sober acceptance of the uncomfortable reality\". Should we accept the uncomfortable reality of Russian-backed ethnic cleansing and military aggression? Matveeva clumsily sidesteps that question, writing, \"Some minorities find it impossible to be ruled by their majority 'host' states.\"</p> <p>What Matveeva does not say is that in Abkhazia, the Russian-backed Abkhazian minority of 17.5% destroyed a thriving multi-ethnic society of 550,000; 80% \u2013 Georgians, Greeks, Estonians, Jews and more \u2013 were killed or terrorised into flight by systematic murder, rape, beating and plunder.</p> <p>Since the fighting of 1992-1993, hundreds of thousands still live as internally displaced people in the rest of Georgia or as refugees in other lands. Natia, who lost her husband in the fighting, was displaced until she returned to Upper Abkhazia in 2006.</p> <p>Her ray of hope came when the Georgian government wrested control of the Kodori Gorge from local thugs. I had the privilege to establish the narrow mountain valley as the seat of the government of Abkhazia. We restored security and normalcy, repaired roads and built schools and a hospital.</p> <p>Our objective was to give people a decent life, thereby setting an example for the rest of Abkhazia. However, in Moscow and Sukhumi, they were preparing war.<br>Matveeva asserts that Abkhazian independence would preserve access for western diplomats and NGOs and prevent its integration into Russia. She overlooks the uncomfortable reality that on April 16, then Russian president, Vladimir Putin, decreed Russia's quasi-annexation of Abkhazia.</p> <p>Then, Russia used Abkhazia \u2013 beyond the gaze of western diplomats and NGOs \u2013 as a staging ground. Stealthily and illegally, Russia began using a former Soviet air base at Gudauta. Russian paratroopers masquerading as peacekeepers deployed with anti-aircraft weapons, artillery and modern armored personnel carriers. Railroad Troops repaired the train line from Sukhumi to a former Soviet naval base at Ochamchire, preparing it to debark 4,000 Russian naval infantry troops during the war.</p> <p>When Russian tanks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia\">attacked north-central Georgia</a> on August 7, a second Russian front was ready in Abkhazia to assault Georgia from the west. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists poured into Upper Abkhazia to repeat the terror of the early 90s. Natia, her children, everyone fled. On television, I watched my office pillaged, some personal effects hurled out of the window. With them went our dreams and everything we had done in two years. School windows were shattered, as were the lives of the children who once laboured over their lessons in those schoolrooms.</p> <p>Today, \"the prospects for any breakthrough are negligible\", writes Matveeva, \"as western leaders continue to avoid confronting awkward issues.\" For once, she and I agree. The Geneva conference sponsors \u2013 the EU, OSCE and UN \u2013say that we will meet again in Geneva in two weeks. </p> <p>If they decide to confront awkward issues, they must repulse Russian diversions and focus on the only legitimate issue: the right of Natia and hundreds of thousands like her to return to their homes in security and dignity.</p> <p>However, if it is treated as a real country, the thugs who ethnically cleansed Abkhazia will never allow, in Matveeva's words, the return of \"a fair share of Georgian refugees who fled the conflict\".</p> <p>There is only one path forward.</p> <p>The EU should insist that Russia, as agreed, withdraw its forces to the lines they held before the war, not park them in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The EU monitors must have access to Abkhazia and South Ossetia to establish whether Russia has kept its word.</p> <p>Then we can take the first steps toward reclaiming a future of human decency through negotiation, democracy and respect for every person. Once, when we lived together, Abkhazia was the most prosperous region in Georgia. Together we can restore our homeland.</p> <p>In late July, I gave an <a href=\"http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=683&amp;catID=2\">interview to the Guardian</a>, published on August 7. I said, \"When I think about the future of Abkhazia, I see my kids growing up there. I see those people who want to go back to their homes building their future there with their kids.\" </p> <p>Please understand that Natia wonders whether you will allow that dream to flourish or to perish beneath Russian tank treads.</p>",
  "<p>The revelation, in yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27192452/\">Washington Post</a>, that the Bush administration \"issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 that explicitly endorsed the agency's use of interrogation techniques such as waterboarding against al-Qaida suspects\" will increase calls for the administration to be held to account for its actions. </p> <p>It is unlikely, though, that this revelation will lead to significant activity, beyond adding more voices to grassroots impeachment campaigns in the United States \u2013 although it may lead to a strengthening of plans in various European countries to indict senior officials for war crimes. As law professor Scott Horton <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=597957fd-6bbf-4d02-b29f-3dbd35176038\">explained</a> in June, the best that opponents of the regime can hope for is that the \"Bush administration officials who pushed torture will need to be careful about their travel plans.\"</p> <p>The problem for all parties concerned is that the administration itself still refuses to concede that it has engaged in torture, and is being allowed to get away with it in the two places where opposition could really count: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Rather than pursuing senior officials, house Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2006/11/08/cq_1916.html\">declared</a> that impeachment was \"off the table\" after the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives two years ago. A month earlier, politicians had endorsed the executive's attempts to shield itself and its employees from any liability for their actions by passing the Military Commissions Act, parts of which were clearly <a href=\"http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/us_law/etn/ca3/hrf-ca3-102406.html\">intended</a> to exempt US officials from being prosecuted for war crimes.</p> <p>Freed from direct challenges, the administration has, instead, attempted to stifle all mention of torture in its dealings with prisoners seized in the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>A case in point is the British resident <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/guantanamo.terrorism\">Binyam Mohamed</a>. According to his lawyers at the legal action charity <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/\">Reprieve</a>, Mr Mohamed, who was seized in Pakistan in April 2002, was sent to Morocco by the CIA (before the agency brought torture \"in-house\"), where proxy torturers extracted a number of false confessions from him. As a result, he was accused of plotting to detonate a radioactive \"dirty bomb\" in a US city, and was put forward for trial by military commission at Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>However, just last week, when a judge in Washington, DC finally had the opportunity to review his case, the US justice department chose to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/14/AR2008101403146.html?hpid=topnews\">drop the charges</a> relating to the \"bomb plot\" rather than pursue them, presumably because senior officials were aware that the entire trail of decision-making as to why Mr Mohamed was rendered to Morocco led to the highest levels of government, and to the kinds of discussions between the CIA and senior officials \u2013 including Vice President Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld \u2013 that were discussed in yesterday's article in the Washington Post.</p> <p>Even so, Mr Mohamed may still face the same charges in a trial by military commission, because the defence department, safe from judicial scrutiny, still believes that it can pursue prosecutions in a system that is so rigged that, when one of the prosecutors, Lt Col Darrel Vandeveld, resigned two weeks ago, he <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iSnYtLdPe0aYIsxWJFTIO0hjBYjwD93EO6P80\">expressed</a> his profound doubts that the system was \"capable of delivering justice\".</p> <p>The fact that some of these cases \u2013 like that of Mr Mohamed \u2013 involve the alleged use of extraordinary rendition and torture by or on behalf of the CIA only serves to confirm that even confirmed critics and opponents of the administration's detention and interrogation policies in the \"war on terror\" are a long way from holding senior officials to account. Perhaps the greatest shame, however, is that out on the campaign trail, where these issues ought to count for something, they are not being mentioned at all.</p>",
  "<p>The government today committed the UK to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions by 80% by the middle of the century in a bid to tackle climate change.</p> <p>In a move that was widely welcomed by environmental campaigners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/03/climatechange.energy\">Ed Miliband, the new energy and climate change secretary</a>, said that the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/16/11\">60% target would be replaced by the higher goal in the climate change bill</a>.</p> <p>Miliband told MPs that the tough economic conditions were not an excuse to \"row back\" on the commitment to tackle global warming.</p> <p>He accepted the recommendations of the government-appointed <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Climate Change Committee</a>, chaired by Lord Turner, which said last week that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/07/carbon.emissions.targets\">UK ought to commit to an 80% reduction from 1990 levels</a> for all greenhouse gases and covering all sectors.</p> <p>He also pledged to amend the energy bill to create \"feed-in tariffs\", allowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/21/renewableenergy.carbonemissions\">small-scale energy producers</a> \u2013 such as homes with wind turbines or solar panels \u2013 to sell electricity at a guaranteed price.</p> <p>And he issued a warning to energy companies to act \"in a satisfactory way\" to reduce charges for customers with pre-payment meters and those not connected to the gas main.</p> <p>He said the government expects \"rapid action or explanation to remedy any abuses\" and warned if the firms do not act then ministers would consult on legislation to prevent \"unfair pricing\".</p> <p>Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's chief scientist, said: \"This is a hugely encouraging first move from the new climate change secretary. In a decade in power Labour has never adopted a target so ambitious, far-reaching and internationally significant as this. </p> <p>\"To meet it will require determined action from Gordon Brown and every one of his successors for the next four decades. Hard choices will be made that will touch every Briton, but it can and must be done.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Ed Miliband obviously understands the urgency of the threat we face from climate change. He is absolutely right to say Britain should set an example to the rest of the world in tackling this issue, and we will support him wholeheartedly if the decisions he takes in the coming weeks and months genuinely reflect this ambition.\" </p> <p>Ruth Davis, the head of climate change at the RSPB, said: \"This is one of the most far-sighted and far-reaching climate change initiative any government could take and is testament to the efforts of campaigners.\"</p> <p>Andy Atkins, Friends of the Earth's executive director, said: \"Miliband's admission that pollution from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/15/climatechange-carbonemissions\">international aviation and shipping will be dealt with outside the bill</a> is a sign that these industries are being picked out for special treatment yet again.<br> \"The Committee on Climate Change made it clear that we have to reduce all carbon emissions by 80%. We cannot leave the cuts in aviation and shipping emissions to chance.\" Greg Clark, the shadow climate change secretary, also welcomed the announcements. He said: \"The choice between aggressive and ambitious action on carbon reduction and a successful, powerful economy is, in fact, not a choice at all - they are one and the same.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/15/greenpolitics-energy\">Miliband, making his first statement to the Commons as head of the newly created department</a>, said: \"In tough economic times, some people ask whether we should retreat from our climate-change objectives.</p> <p>\"In our view it would be quite wrong to row back and those who say we should misunderstand the relationship between the economic and environmental tasks we face.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/stern_review_climate_change.htm\">2006 Stern report</a> showed that the costs of doing nothing \"are greater than the costs of acting\", he said.</p> <p>The climate change bill would be amended to set the higher target, which \"will be binding in law\".</p> <p>Miliband said: \"However, we all know that signing up to an 80% target in 2050 when most of us will not be around is the easy part. The hard part is meeting it and meeting the milestones that will show we're on track.\"</p> <p>The Climate Change Committee will advise on the first 15 years of carbon budgets in December, \"national limits to our total emissions within which we will have to live as a country\".</p> <p>The announcement on feed-in tariffs will be welcomed by Labour backbenchers, who staged the biggest revolt of Gordon Brown's leadership over the issue.</p> <p>In April, 35 backbenchers rebelled on the issue during debate on the energy bill, with two more Labour MPs acting as tellers.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Having heard the debate on this issue, including from many colleagues in this house, on this side of the house and on others, I also believe that complementing the renewables obligation for large-scale projects, guaranteed prices for small-scale electricity generation \u2013 feed-in tariffs \u2013 have the potential to play an important role, as they do in other countries.\"</p> <p>Last week Ofgem, the energy regulator, highlighted \"unjustified\" higher charges for 4 million customers without mains gas.</p> <p>The regulator also believes that many homes using pre-payment meters - often the poorest customers - are being \"overcharged\".</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Unfair pricing which hits the most vulnerable hardest is completely unacceptable. I made that clear to the representatives of the big six energy companies when I met them yesterday.</p> <p>\"I also told them that the government expects rapid action or explanation to remedy any abuses. I will meet them again in a month to hear what they have done.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If the companies don't act in a satisfactory way, and speedily, then we will consult on legislation to prevent unfair pricing differentials.\"</p> <p>Miliband said the measures announced today were part of an energy and climate change policy \"that is fair and sustainable, which meets our obligations to today's and future generations\".</p> <p>Clark said there had been a \"decade-long void\" in the government's policy towards energy, in which \"successive ministers have looked the other way rather than address the issue of future energy needs\".</p> <p>He welcomed the acceptance of Turner's 80% target, saying: \"We have always said that we should be guided by the science on that matter.\"</p> <p>But he called for the target to be kept under constant review, saying that just eight years ago 60% was considered to be the right number.</p> <p>Clark also pressed Miliband to \"lead the world\" on carbon capture and storage by committing to three UK-based demonstration projects and said smart metering should be introduced for microgeneration.</p>",

That's no secret: McCain has voted against a woman's right to choose for more than 25 years, and he has even voted against birth control, which is one of the best ways to reduce the need for abortion.\"</p> <p>The Former senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, an Obama supporter, said McCain \"spent 90 minutes tonight on the attack\".</p> <p>Speaking on MSNBC shortly after the forum ended, he said: \"You know, about two-thirds of the American people think that he's an angry candidate.

  "<p>\"Turkey in all its colours\" is a prominent slogan at this week's Frankfurt Book Fair, where the country is guest of honour. But this was never going to be entirely true after July, when a group of high-profile authors announced a boycott of the fair over their unwillingness to be represented at the fair by Turkey's AKP government and its cultural minister. And though there are bright displays from 100 of its many publishers around the halls, you don't have to look too closely to see the shades of censorship over writers whose freedom of expression has long been heavily restricted.</p> <p>Despite this there are more than 300 Turkish writers in Frankfurt this week, including some who have been prosecuted under 2005's notorious Article 301 law which criminalised \"insulting Turkishness\" - most prominently Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, fellow novelist Elif Shafak and novelist and columnist Perihan Magden.</p> <p>Magden, a self-described \"traitor\" to Turkey, wasn't actually invited by the organising committee to attend the fair. But she's here because her publisher invited her, and because she believes it's a chance for the world to hear about Turkish literature for reasons other than the prosecution of its writers.</p> <p>\"It's a good thing in general for us, because only Orhan Pamuk is known abroad,\" she says, taking a short break from an hectic interview schedule which, she notes, has not been affected by her \"unofficial\" status here. \"Being the guest of honour will help us a lot, especially with our relationship with Europe. Anglo Saxon countries have a different way of looking at Turks, but the way France and Germany look [at us] is very negative - they really don't want us to be part of the European Union. </p> <p>She's also hoping that it may promote a better understanding of the many Turks living as \"strangers in the night\" in Europe. \"This gives a chance for Germans to see that Turks are not one-dimensional peasants who are frozen in time \u2026 They can see through our literature - we have such a vast variety in our literature - so this helps developing our relationship with Europe, definitely.\"</p> <p>There's certainly potential for a much wider presence for Turkish writing in translation. English readers get few opportunities to read a literature that here in Frankfurt is being shown to run the gamut from crime fiction via feminist critique to comic writing and discussions of epic poetry. </p> <p>\"Frankfurt tends to pick those who've not been in the spotlight [as guest of honour] and Turkey for sure has not been in the spotlight for its culture and literature, but for political reasons,\" says publisher M\u00fcge G\u00fcrsoy S\u00f6kmen, one of the fair's organisers who has also chaired a PEN committee on Turkish writers in prison. \"We want Turkey to be remembered for its culture. Of course it has other problems - censorship, that's our struggle, but people do not censor themselves,\" she says, adding that there are 1,700 independent publishers in Turkey.</p> <p>According to PEN, more than 1,000 people, including writers, publishers and journalists, have been brought to the courts for \"insulting the Turkish republic\" since 2005. Magden is just one of them: she was tried and later acquitted for a magazine column criticising military conscription in Turkey. Publisher Ragip Zarakolu was not so lucky; after he published a book acknowledging the Armenian genocide, The Truth Will Set Us Free, he was convicted in June of having transgressed Article 301.</p> <p>Zarakolu is at the fair nonetheless, and hopes it will provide a \"platform [to discuss] our problem of freedom of expression\". He's on a panel on Friday tackling this very issue, and the fair's programme says the topic will be \"approached free from conservative and reactionary approaches\".</p> <p>\"We're not brushing it under the carpet, on the contrary,\" insists S\u00f6kmen. \"We're not trying to have a diplomatic presence, this is a publishing fair...We are publishers who think about these issues all the time.\"</p> <p>Zarakolu is unbowed by his conviction, which was reduced from five months in prison to a fine, and says he'd publish again if he needed to. \"I'm always against auto censorship, and I'm also one of the promoters of freedom of expression in Turkey,\" he says.</p> <p>Turkey's AKP government has created \"huge problems\", he says, by obstructing free speech in recent years despite its much-trumpeted \"transition to democracy\". He says that he was singled out by a nationalist judiciary riled by his addressing discrimination against Turkey's Kurdish population.</p> <p>Zarakolu will be speaking his mind during his panel debate, as has the equally undaunted Magden, exhausted but revelling in the press attention. \"Because my book is published in Germany they interview me, and because I'm a columnist they ask me political stuff. I always tell them that Turkey's main issue is not the fundamentalists or the Kurdish threat but the omnipotent position of the army.\" She says she is very glad of this opportunity to talk about her country, but is not optimistic the fair will help open up public debate at home.</p> <p>\"I am not making even one speech for the culture ministry, and my book sells more than other books, but it doesn't matter, I'm a blacklisted name\". Her agent Barbaros Altug is no less critical of the fair. \"If you're saying 'Turkey in all its colours' then you have to include all, but they didn't,\" he says. \"A whole generation of writers is missing, between 55 and 75 years old. Latife Tekin is one of the most translated writers, considered a perennial Nobel contender. Leyla Erbil is not here. Some have some conflicts with the cultural policy of the government, some have boycotted the fair, some were not invited at all - and this is an important group.\"</p> <p>Despite all this, English PEN is hopeful that Turkey's presence as guest of honour could prove a real turning point for freedom of expression in the country. </p> <p>\"At PEN we feel that if authors like Pamuk and Shafak and Magden, who've all been the victims of Turkey's anti-free speech culture are prepared to be here, that suggests to us that perhaps this is a really important moment and a positive moment,\" says director Jonathan Heawood, pointing to Pamuk's willingness to appear next to Turkish president Abdullah Gul at Tuesday's opening ceremony. </p> <p>Pamuk himself used that opportunity to hit out at the \"oppression\" of Turkey's writers, but also hailed \"Istanbul's vibrant book trade [which] at last represents its rich and layered history\". </p> <p>Heawood adds: \"The world's press knows what has been going on in Turkey for the last few years, and hopefully we can get some momentum out of this in particular with reference to laws in Turkey, especially 301.\"</p> <p>He is less hopeful about next year's guest of honour, China, where according to PEN there are currently 42 writers and journalists held in Chinese prisons.</p> <p>\"In a sense we have seen that Turkey does have the capacity to change. In response to the pressure from outside and inside they have changed 301 slightly - not quite enough. Whereas China - we all thought the Olympics would give the opportunity for the government to gracefully allow more freedom of speech, but the opposite happened. I don't have enormous hope that for China, western engagement is an answer. [Plus] for publishers China represents such an enormous market that there will be very little will on the part of the western publishing industry to use Frankfurt as a human rights standpoint.\"</p> <p>It is to be hoped that 2010's guest of honour Argentina proves less problematic.</p>",
  "<p>Until Anil Kumble joined the club earlier this year, no bowler had taken <a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=2;orderby=wickets;qualmin1=100;qualval1=wickets;template=results;type=bowling\">100 Test wickets against Australia</a> since a <a href=\"http://www.kingston-jamaica.net/cuddys_grill_in_kingston_jamaica.htm\">sports-bar owner from Kingston</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NeI6uL_uso\">destroyer of Perth</a> with the middle names Elconn Lynwall combined to such devastating effect in the 1990s. Kumble is in pretty illustrious company, then, and that might help to explain why there has been so much debate over his form in the days leading up to tomorrow's second Test between India and Australia. </p> <p>Usually a composed soul with no interest in grandstanding, Kumble has lashed out at his critics in his <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=5ca1f13d-026c-407d-b003-d1cdbb9024e2\">latest newspaper column</a>, but angry words cannot obscure the fact that many of the concerns are legitimate.</p> <p>Since claiming 20 wickets in Australia at the turn of the year, Kumble has taken only 12 wickets from six Tests at an average of well over 60, and the wicketless display on home turf last week was only his third in 131 Tests. Worryingly, two of those have come this season. Appalling wicketkeeping and shoddy fielding may have worsened his plight in Sri Lanka, but ultimately he took eight wickets in a series where Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan managed 47.</p> <p>We can only speculate as to how much the workload has contributed to the decline. Since assuming the captaincy, Kumble has bowled 178.3 overs against Pakistan (three Tests), 181.3 overs in Australia (four Tests), 98 against South Africa (two Tests) and 134.5 in Sri Lanka (three Tests). At the Chinnaswamy Stadium this week, despite the sore shoulder, he gritted his teeth through 51 overs. You get a better insight when you compare his figures to those of Shane Warne, the other great leggie of our age. Though he has played 14 fewer Tests, Kumble has bowled only 140 deliveries less than Warne. And if anything, the onus on him to deliver has only been greater in his second coming (after shoulder surgery in 2001), with Harbhajan Singh unable to reprise his heroics against Steve Waugh's Australians.</p> <p>These days though, Harbhajan looks the more likely man, and Ricky Ponting has already <a href=\"http://www.cricinfo.com/indvaus2008/content/current/story/374117.html\">started the mind games</a> ahead of a match that starts on the day Kumble blows out 38 candles on his birthday cake. It is a brave gambit to rile a man who has 59 Australian wickets at 23.57 from nine Tests on home soil, but it seems fairly obvious that Ponting and his boys view Kumble in the same way that Kevin Pietersen and others looked at the once-magnificent-but-clearly-knackered Jason Gillespie during the Ashes of 2005.</p> <p>There's no escaping the fact that India do have a selection problem on their hands. The last time India played at Mohali, against England nearly three years ago, Munaf Patel had a revelatory debut, reverse-swinging the ball at pace to spearhead the push for victory. With Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma the most impressive Indian bowlers on view in Bangalore, and inclement weather in the Punjab, the temptation to beef up the pace attack with Munaf will be immense.</p> <p>There's just one problem. Munaf was amazing in that game, but the man of the match award went to another, who took nine for 146 and scored 32 vital runs. Kumble has 36 wickets from seven Tests at the venue, and you can only feel for those that have to choose between the proven-but-perhaps-crocked champion and the young gun with a point or three to prove.</p> <p>Australia too have bowling worries, with Stuart Clark's elbow injury ruling him out. Victoria's Peter Siddle will make his debut on Friday, though a relatively pace-friendly surface and India's historical frailty against genuinely quick left-arm bowlers (remember <a href=\"http://content-www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/47165.html\">Brett Schultz</a>?) might have made it worthwhile to throw Doug Bollinger's cap into the selection ring.</p> <p>Cameron White probably did enough in Bangalore to keep his place, though the Indian batsmen are unlikely to be as restrained against him at the second time of asking. There are shades of the old Kumble in the way he bowls the top-spinner, though he lacks the variety and accuracy that made the Jumbo of old such a fearsome beast.</p> <p>Both Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden, who have stellar Indian feats behind them, failed in Bangalore, and Hayden was out in the middle long after everyone else had departed, engaged in his usual sat-down meditation and shadow-strokeplay. But for an Air Force chopper that flew overhead as he was about to leave the venue, nothing disturbed his concentration.</p> <p>The media's focus, Kumble's travails apart, is very much on Sachin Tendulkar, now only 15 runs short of Brian Lara's record tally. Nothing lifts Tendulkar's game quite like a tussle against Australia (against whom he has nine centuries) and the solid 49 on the final day of the first Test has at least temporarily quieted those who were clamouring for his exit after a miserable tour of Sri Lanka. In Australia less than a year ago, he scored 494 runs, so it's safe to say that \"public sentiment\" and \"expert opinions\" are of as much importance as the President's pitch on the opening day of baseball season.</p> <p>This is Brett Lee's Indian Premier League home ground (Kings XI Punjab) and it is a sign of the changing times that India now have a pace attack capable of matching anything that Australia put on the field tomorrow. But even if Kumble sits out this game, hold off on those tributes. The third Test starts in Delhi on October 29. Unless the shoulder is a lot worse than we've been told it is, nothing will keep India's greatest match-winner away from the Kotla, the venue where he has 55 wickets from six Tests at the frankly ridiculous average of 15.41.</p>",
  "<p>Real Madrid have identified Manchester United striker Carlos Tevez as their \"primary\" transfer target, according to Madrid-based newspaper Marca. Although Tevez has been playing at United since the beginning of last season, his registration is still held by Media Sports Investment (MSI), and Marca claims a proposed deal to sign him on a permanent basis could still fall through. </p> <p>\"Manchester United must pay \u20ac37m (\u00a328.8m) to MSI before January 30,\" reports Marca today, stating that Tevez's two-year loan to United will expire on that date. \"If they don't, Tevez will effectively be owned by MSI, and Real Madrid will set the wheels in motion to bring him to the Bernabeu next season.</p> <p>\"[Madrid manager] Bernd Schuster has made it clear that the signing of a world class striker must be a priority for next season,\" continues the report. \"[Sporting director Predrag] Mijatovic agrees with him.\"<br> Marca is regarded by many in Spain as an unofficial mouthpiece for Real, and a number of the club's most high-profile signings \u2013 notably those of Zin\u00e9dine Zidane and David Beckham \u2013 have come on the back of concerted campaigns by the paper. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson branded Marca a \"vehicle to unsettle players\" after it published a series of reports this summer suggesting that Cristiano Ronaldo was close to joining Madrid.</p> <p>Today's report, however, did concede that signing Tevez could be \"fairly complicated\" for Real. \"At the moment, the situation is out of Real's hands,\" it continued. \"[But] at least if Tevez's contract does fall under the control of MSI, Real Madrid won't have to deal with Manchester United!\"</p> <p>Tevez, for his part, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/16/premierleague-manchesterunited\">is unhappy with his level of performance</a> at United this season after scoring just once for the club in nine appearances. He has been disappointed with his form just at the moment when competition for places has increased following the arrival of Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham. </p> <p>\"I am not as dangerous as I used to be,\" admitted Tevez. \"I am not as effective in the penalty area any more. That is something I have lost and something I have to get back. I used to score better goals, great goals. But something strange has happened.\"</p>",
  "<p>Let's look at the good news in the <a href=\"http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/newsandevents/newsstories.cfm?cit_id=1425&amp;FAArea1=customWidgets.content_view_1&amp;usecache=false\">Healthcare Commission report</a> out today, which surveys the performance ratings of 391 NHS organisations. Forty-two of the trusts which control hospitals, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/16/nhs-health\">scored extremely well</a> for both quality of care and financial management. Ambulances got to 77% of life-threatening emergencies within eight minutes. More mental health facilities were set up in the community. Many if not most patients are now seen in hospital outpatients' departments within 18 weeks of GP referral. And if you are suspected of having cancer, you can expect to be seen within two weeks.</p> <p>It is a great story of optimism, dynamism and progress. But what's a news story without a big \"but\" and an evil bogeyman? So here's the \"but\". Antibiotic resistant infections are still a problem in hospitals. Apparently 60% of hospitals are still not dealing effectively with MRSA and other \"superbug\" infections. And here's the bogeyman. It's your local GP: 69% of GPs, it appears, do not provide easy access for patients. </p> <p>Anna Walker, the commission's chief executive, noted a dramatic decline in the number of primary care trusts (PCTs) who say that every patient in their patch can be seen by their GP within two working days. Last year, when individual GP practices, rather than PCTs, reported on whether they were meeting this target, the figure was 80%.</p> <p>Gary Needle, the commission's head of assessment, thinks he can account for this discrepancy. He thinks GPs may have been lying last year.</p> <p>Now it is possible that GPs deliberately lied last year, and that the PCT figure this year is completely accurate. It is possible that all statistics that GPs are relied on to collect, are lies, and that everything the Healthcare Commission reports, is gospel. It is possible that the 90% of patients who reported being able to get a GP appointment within 48 hours, in a recent, national sample of patient satisfaction, were also lying, though I have no idea why they should.</p> <p>But there are other explanations that Gary Needle may want to consider. PCTs may not have accurate records. They may have to report that as a PCT, they can't deliver the target because one or two practices aren't delivering even though the majority are. </p> <p>In August, the PCT phoned my practice to do a spot check. They pose as a patient and ask when the next available appointment is, firstly with any doctor, then with a particular doctor. We had a new receptionist on the phone that day. She'd had training but got a bit muddled up. She told the PCT that there weren't any appointments for 48 hours, as she didn't realise she could unblock the emergency ones which are held in reserve each day. So we missed the target in August. And, who knows, perhaps the whole PCT missed the target because of us. But it wasn't true that there were no appointments, and I'm not lying \u2013 honest!</p> <p>This month, we're giving out patient survey forms which we have to do once a year. We give out a form to the first 100 people through the door in a given week. They get sent to an external organisation and the results are fed back to us and available for all to see. I had a quick glance at some of the forms that had been completed. I realised that many of the 100 people aren't aware of the range of appointments we offer now. Many don't know that we open at 7.30am each weekday morning. The information is on our practice leaflet, website and waiting room poster. The receptionists try to tell people who phone about the range of options. But clearly, we need to find better ways of spreading the word. The survey isn't going to be an accurate reflection of the true range of appointments. And no, I didn't tamper with the forms, lie or forge the results. Generally, we try not to do that. </p> <p>The reported improvements in healthcare are great news and GPs deserve a share of the acclaim. You wouldn't get seen so quickly in hospital, if your GP didn't refer you promptly and appropriately. If 90% of the population surveyed say they are seen by their GP within 48 hours, they probably are. They can't all be lying too!</p>",
  "<p>European Union leaders agreed today to stick to ambitious plans to cut greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020, but divisions over how to share the cuts were widened by fears over the impact of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, threatened to veto the plan unless changes were made to lessen the burden on Italian industry. \"Our companies are in no state to take on costs like those we thought about last year,\" Berlusconi told reporters.</p> <p>And the leaders of eight eastern European countries said the EU must balance the wish for cleaner air against \"the need for sustainable economic growth\" at a time of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>Despite those concerns, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said all leaders had agreed to work to find a final agreement on the package before the end of the year.</p> <p>\"The crisis should not lower our ambitions,\" Sarkozy said. \"No one said that they wanted to renounce the objectives.\"</p> <p>The plan would cost governments and business billions of euros to implement new cleaner technologies, renewable energy sources, and reduce emissions from cars and factories.</p> <p>Berlusconi said that was unfair since competitors to European industry in China and the United States would not have to face such a burdens.</p> <p>Leaders of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia released a joint statement on the issue, saying they had made great cuts in carbon emissions since emerging from communism in the late 1980s and that \"should be recognised\" now.</p> <p>If not, they said, eastern European nations will pay disproportionately towards an EU climate change package agreed in 2007 that calls for a slashing of greenhouse gas emissions and creating a costly emissions trading programme.</p> <p>Sarkozy, however, urged all EU nations \"bear their historic responsibility as leaders of Europe to face up to the climate challenge.\" </p> <p>He said investing in clean energy could spark economic growth. \"We can't delay, we cannot postpone,\" Sarkozy said.</p> <p>The recent financial turmoil has triggered fears of a global recession that would make governments less keen to get major polluters such as energy generators, steel makers and cement producers to pay billions into a cap-and-trade emissions scheme.</p> <p>The EU cap-and-trade programme could impose \u20ac50bn a year in polluter fees. Each of the bloc's 27 governments, including the eight eastern European countries, and the European parliament, need to approve the plan for it to become law.</p> <p>If the EU backs off, it would be seen as a harsh blow to UN climate change talks planned for December in Poland that will include delegates from more than 190 countries. </p> <p>The conference will work out the details of a climate change accord to succeed the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association will enforce the legal requirement for bookmakers to assist in its match-fixing inquiries after launching an investigation into allegations of a betting sting at Derby County's recent 2-1 win over Norwich City.</p> <p>The bookmaker Spreadex noted suspicious betting patterns during the match at Carrow Road on October 4. Punters in the far east are believed to have placed a flood of money during half-time.</p> <p>The Gambling Act makes provision for all sports governing bodies to demand the assistance of bookmakers when investigating threats to their competitions' integrity. The FA, which has confirmed that Norwich-Derby is under suspicion, will now call on that legislation to widen its inquiries to other layers.</p> <p>The Norwich north MP, Ian Gibson, who attended the Championship match, has tabled a parliamentary question to the culture secretary demanding swift action in the inquiry. \"It should be easy to find out how much money was put on that game and when it was put on,\" said Gibson. \"The FA should give us a fast interim report.\"</p> <p>He recalled that Roy Carroll, Derby's goalkeeper, was sent off five minutes after half-time, and Sammy Clingan converted the resulting penalty to equalise. Derby took all three points after a defensive mix-up involving Norwich's goalkeeper and centre-half, allowing Nathan Ellington to score from close range. However Gibson reflected that no one had considered the circumstances as anything other than the normal course of a football match. \"No one who was there thought it suspicious,\" he said.</p> <p>As they press ahead with inquiries FA compliance officers will ask for cooperation from Betfair, which holds an information-sharing agreement with Soho Square, high-street bookies through the Association of British Bookmakers and the online layers' association.

  "<p>In her <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/jacqui_smith_speech,2008-09-21\">speech to the Labour conference</a> this September, the home secretary Jacqui Smith made clear her intention to criminalise clients of \"trafficked\" sex workers and stated that, from October, she will begin work to outlaw paying for sex with those who are \"forced into prostitution at another's will, or controlled for another's gain\". </p> <p>Stirring stuff, yet Smith seems coy about giving the actual figures for trafficked workers. The <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/pentameter-2\">official figures</a> for the police operation Pentameter 1 showed, that despite 55 forces hunting for them, only 88 women were trafficked. Since it is accepted on all sides of the debate that 80,000 work in the sex industry, then the number of those trafficked amounts to 0.11% of those in sex work. According to <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080715/text/80715w0010.htm\">a recent parliamentary answer</a>, Pentameter 2 improved on that performance with the recovery of 167 victims of trafficking \u2013 but that still represents only 0.21% of sex workers. </p> <p>In other words, the impression Smith gives that the sex industry is rife with trafficking is highly misleading. Meanwhile, criminalising the clients \u2013 who often tip off police when they have qualms about a worker's status \u2013 of that small percentage will only make things worse for the workers. </p> <p>Smith wants to remove the word \"persistent\" from kerb-crawling laws as, in her view, \"once around the block is once too many \u2013 and so we'll make kerb-crawling punishable as a first offence\". This will create a new sus-type law for police to stop anyone at will. Smith also wants to give councils and the police new powers to close down brothels and clamp down on exploitation. But this only displaces the trade and puts women on the street where they are less safe. </p> <p>Since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, police authorities have been empowered to freeze and then sell assets of brothel-keepers and parlour managers, and this money is then split four ways, with the Home Office, CPS, Courts Service and police all getting their share. The <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2005/en/ukpgaen_20050015_en_1\">Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005</a> extended powers for civil recovery of assets (see, for example, s245A, 245B). In s110, the power of arrest is extended to enable police or community wardens to arrest, without warrant, anyone for any offence, or on suspicion that an offence might be committed, however trivial, in connection with the so-called crime of brothel-keeping. It is wrong that the Home Office has provided the police with such a huge vested interest in the criminalisation of sex work. </p> <p>The home secretary wants to give communities a \"stronger say\" (whatever that is) in stopping lap-dancing clubs opening in their areas. Female government ministers have criticised lap-dancing clubs, yet the government's own licensing laxity that has made the prevalence of clubs possible. In fact, cases at court and tribunals such as <a href=\"http://www.taxbar.com/documents/Spearmint_Rhino_ch.pdf\">Spearmint Rhino v HMRC (2007) (pdf)</a> show that the women who work in lap dancing clubs are self-employed workers with agency. The vast majority of clubs offer good, safe working conditions, say many of the only people qualified to judge \u2013 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/the_p_word/newsid_7362000/7362280.stm\">the dancers</a>. </p> <p>Smith talks of the \"considerable support\" of the public, but if she means the Ipsos Mori poll the government commissioned to ask mostly anti-sex work questions, the same Ipsos Mori poll <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/content/publics-views-on-prostitution.ashx\">found that 59% of people</a> agreed that \"prostitution is a perfectly reasonable choice that women should be free to make\". Doubtless that figure would be higher if the question also included men, or transgender workers. Only 27% disagreed, and 37% of people would not be ashamed if a family member was working as a prostitute. Half of those questioned felt that the purchase of sex should be legal. Only 43% felt that it should be illegal. </p> <p>The government's proposals would not affect \"sole traders\"; and according to the sex workers' union, <a href=\"http://www.iusw.org/\">IUSW</a>, the majority of sex workers are self-employed independents who never come to the attention of police or researchers, so the government should surely be doing more to empower this group of workers. Why, therefore, are they insisting that they work alone, rather than in groups known to make their work safer? </p> <p>There are three main policy approaches to prostitution. First, there is the regulationist approach, seen in differing forms in Nevada and the Netherlands. Second, there is the prohibitionist approach, which is formal policy in Thailand and in many US states, such as New York. Prohibition, of course, never succeeds in its primary aim and, in fact, usually institutionalises the criminality and corruption associated with the sex industry. </p> <p>The third way is decriminalisation, an approach that has recently emerged in New Zealand. In 2003, the <a href=\"http://www.justice.govt.nz/prostitution-law-review-committee/publications/plrc-report/index.html\">Prostitution Reform Act</a> in New Zealand decriminalised prostitution without \"endorsing or morally sanctioning it or its use\". The legislation safeguards the human rights of sex workers and promotes their health and safety. In a review of the act's operation, New Zealand's law review committee <a href=\"http://www.justice.govt.nz/prostitution-law-review-committee/publications/plrc-report/ex-summary.html\">found that</a> \"the PRA has empowered sex workers by removing the taint of criminality from their occupation, and part of that empowerment is to take control of their employment relationships\" and \"over 90% of sex workers in each sector felt that they have legal rights under the PRA. Over 60% of sex workers in each sector felt that they were more able to refuse to provide commercial sexual services to a particular client since the enactment of the PRA\". As regards violence \"a significant minority thought that there had been an improvement since the enactment of the PRA. Of those feeling in a position to comment, the majority felt sex workers were now more likely to report incidents of violence to the Police.\" PRA has not increased underage involvement in prostitution, but the committee found that \"the passage of the PRA has raised awareness of the problem of under age prostitution, and that this is a positive consequence\". Yet the UK government has only discussed two sides of the debate, regulation and prohibition. When I met with government ministers Vernon Coaker and Barbara Follet separately this year and asked whether a ministerial group would be going to New Zealand (where they had been invited), the response was that it was \"too far\".</p> <p>None of the reports upon which the UK government depends has been through the proper academic peer-review process. Indeed, some of the government-sponsored reports have been <a href=\"http://www.drpetra.co.uk/resources/BigBrothelAcademicSummResponseSept08.pdf \">criticised (pdf)</a> by <a href=\"http://www.drpetra.co.uk/resources/AcademicResponseBigBrothelSept2008-1.pdf \">academics and researchers (pdf)</a>. For example, the absurd research methodology from the <a href=\"http://www.equalities.gov.uk/publications/Women_Not_For_Sale.pdf\"> equalities' office research (pdf)</a>, which involved over-interpreting advertisements in local papers on a single day to link services of foreign women advertised there to spurious, over-inflated trafficking figures of 10,000 (p 10); the research report <a href=\"http://www.eaves4women.co.uk/Publications.php\">Big Brothel</a>, produced by the Poppy Project, which receives government funding, expressed horror at the prices being offered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/03/research.women\">without pointing out</a> this was at only one venue or that that prices ranged up to \u00a3250. Staggeringly, its researchers estimated numbers of workers by telephoning numbers advertised in London newspapers. Such calling results in massive over-counting as sex workers work from different flats on different weeks or days.</p> <p>In addition, ordinary police officers do not want this legislation. Research I carried out for my book <a href=\"http://www.willanpublishing.co.uk/cgi-bin/scribe?showdoc=5;doctype=review\">The Price of Sex</a> including interviews with male and female officers <a href=\"http://www.willanpublishing.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=1843920875\">showed</a> that ordinary officers do not want to make things worse for sex workers. So I have to ask whether the home secretary is playing populist politics for short-term advantage at the expense of policy making that might actually benefit vulnerable workers in the sex industry.</p>",

  "<p>Janet Jackson has recovered from her mystery illness and will be resuming her postponed tour. Not only that, but the mystery illness has been revealed! The pop star has been suffering from vestibular migraines.</p> <p>Jackson's \"Rock Witchu\" tour was getting off to a troubled start. She first cancelled a gig in Montreal on September 29, and was rushed to hospital after a sound check. Jackson later called off nine dates across the US, including shows in Philadelphia, Boston, Atlanta and New York City.</p> <p>Her management had refused to disclose the nature of Jackson's illness, leading to speculation about heavy partying, drug use or even pregnancy. But as Jackson took the stage last night in Washington, DC, those fears seemed allayed.</p> <p>\"After a thorough medical evaluation, it has been confirmed that Janet's symptoms are being caused by a rare form of migraine called vestibular migraine, or migraine-associated vertigo, for which she is currently receiving treatment,\" manager Kenneth Crear explained in a statement.</p> <p>\"Janet wanted very much to resume her tour so as not to disappoint her fans, but she continued to suffer from vertigo and could not perform,\" he said. \"She's feeling much better and is ready to hit the road again to finish the tour.\"</p> <p>The cancelled gigs are to be re-scheduled. Jackson has yet to announce any British or European dates.<br></p>",

  "<p>Express Newspapers today apologised in the high court to the \"tapas seven\" and paid them \u00a3375,000 in libel damages for printing false allegations about them after the disappearance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/madeleinemccann\">Madeleine McCann</a>. </p> <p>The group had been dining with Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, the night the girl disappeared from her holiday apartment in the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal on May 3, 2007.</p> <p>Today's apology came after Express Newspapers titles the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/dailyexpress\">Daily Express</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/dailystar\">Daily Star</a> printed apologies to the \"tapas seven\".</p> <p>Adam Tudor, from law firm Carter-Ruck, representing the group, said in the statement read out in the high court: \"The defendant accepts that these allegations are wholly untrue and there was no evidence to support them.</p> <p>\"The defendant accepts that these actions of the claimants following Madeleine's disappearance were entirely proper and were motivated by a desire to find Madeleine and to support the McCann family through a very difficult time.\"</p> <p>Six members of the group - Jane Tanner, Fiona Payne, David Payne, Matthew Oldfield, Rachael Oldfield and Diane Webster - were at the high court when the statement was read out in front of Mr Justice Eady. The seventh member, Russell O'Brien, was not present.</p> <p>The \u00a3375,000 damages payment will go to the Find Madeleine Fund. Express Newspapers has also agreed to pay the legal costs of the \"tapas seven\". </p> <p>Solicitor Keith Mathieson, acting for Express Newspapers, said: \"The defendant apologises to all of the claimants for publishing false allegations about them. The defendant regrets the distress caused.\" </p> <p>Fiona Payne spoke on behalf of the \"tapas seven\" outside the high court: \"The abduction of Madeleine McCann, daughter of our friends Kate and Gerry on May 3, 2007, changed all our lives in an instant, but for no one more so than Madeleine.</p> <p>\"The defamatory stories written about us were not only extremely damaging on a personal level but we strongly feel were detrimental to the search for Madeleine. This aspect has been particularly heartbreaking.</p> <p>\"Although we are very pleased with today's result it changes little. Madeleine's plight remains ongoing: she is still missing, her abductor is still free. Our only motivation is to see her finally recovered and reunited with her family that so adore her. </p> <p>\"We believe that Madeleine is still alive and can be found. We ask anyone who has any information, however small, to come forward, as we thank wholeheartedly all those who have already done so.\"</p> <p>Today's payout follows previous libel damages settlements this year by British papers to the McCanns and to Robert Murat.</p> <p>In July, Murat accepted more than \u00a3600,000 in damages from 11 British newspapers after he was libelled in more than 100 articles.</p> <p>The Express Newspapers-owned Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star; Associated Newspapers' Daily Mail, Evening Standard, and Metro; Mirror Group Newspapers' Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror and Scottish Daily Record; and News Group's Sun and News of the World acknowledged that the stories they had run about Murat over nine months were entirely untrue and should never have been printed.</p> <p>In March, Kate and Gerry McCann accepted \u00a3550,000 from Express Newspapers after the Daily and Sunday Express, the Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday ran numerous defamatory articles after their daughter Madeleine disappeared from the Praia da Luz resort on May 3, 2007.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>If you're interested in the story about Peter Mandelson and his relationship with the Russian billionaire <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a> (which the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4926572.ece\">Sunday Times</a> first broke at the weekend), it's worth reading <a href=\"http://wpbenjamin.livejournal.com/10414.html#cutid1\">Benjamin Wegg-Prosser's blog today</a> for an account that tries to put it in some sort of context.<br><br>Wegg-Prosser, of course, used to work for Mandelson. He now lives in Russia, he's been present when Mandelson and Deripaska have met socially (although he wasn't on that yacht in Corfu) and he's written about it <a href=\"http://wpbenjamin.livejournal.com/10414.html#cutid1\">on his blog today</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>I have seen these two men together at first hand on a couple of occasions. Upon taking up his role in Brussels, trips to Moscow became a regular feature in Peter's schedule. No surprise there; the EU is Russia's largest trading partner, there are regular summits between both parties, while Russia's entry into the WTO became in recent years nearly as important as the Doha Round itself. The first time I met them was a while back when he dined with Deripaska, German Gref (then the Russian trade minister) and Nat Rothschild at a neighbouring table to our own in Moscow's Pushkin Caf\u00e9. I recall my wife shared a long conversation with Gref about their time at Omsk University.</p> <p>On one of his more recent trade trips to Moscow Peter spent a day at our dacha (we tried to go for a walk but it was -20\u00ba and we only got as far as the end of the path before turning back). We then went into Moscow and ended up having dinner with Deripaska. My main memory from the evening was the fierce disagreement, to the point of raised voices, that both men had on two issues: first, Russia's entry to the WTO, Peter wanted them to join, Deripaska didn't; second, the tariffs which the Russians were imposing on Finnish timber imports, Peter said they were illegal, protectionist and wrong, Deripaska argued that they were a necessary defence mechanism to protect a key national industry in an emerging economy. Their friendship was founded on these sort of jousts and arguments.</p> <p>When Gordon Brown appointed Peter to his new job he made a point of highlighting the experience which he'd acquired in Europe and beyond. Peter was a success in Brussels in part down to the network of contacts which he built up across the Bric countries. And surprise surprise, that meant socialising with them. But these people are experienced enough to know that large cumbersome bureaucracies such as the European commission make decisions on things like tariffs after considerable thought and process not over deals done on gin palaces drinking cocktails overlooking Corfu.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bric countries? I had to check it. It's an acronym for the fast-growing developing countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.</p>",
  "<p>The government has acquired a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/banking-royalbankofscotlandgroup\">major stake</a> in the Royal Bank of Scotland. There is something extraordinarily perverse about this. RBS is <a href=\"http://www.projectfinancemagazine.com/default.asp?page=7&amp;PubID=4&amp;ISS=10900&amp;SID=\" 432228\" \">a supplier to the Public Finance Initiative</a> (PFI). This is also true of other banks that have been offered support by the government. We are now in the absurd position that the government, local authorities and health trusts are paying a hefty premium on their financing costs to transfer risks to banks that are under public control. <br> What is more absurd is that PFI exactly mirrors the model of finance that has brought the banking system to its knees. PFI structures are a loan by any other name. All that really happens is that the person who contracts to build a project for the public sector also agrees to finance it, and in exchange charges a higher price than the government would pay if it borrowed the funds directly. This excess is supposed to be a \"risk premium\" but it is clear that is not true. First, in the case of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6903977.stm\">Metronet</a>, the risk returned to the public sector when the contractors failed. The premium had been paid without benefit being provided. Second, in very many cases the <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/pn/01-02/01021288.htm\">premium has been pure profit</a>, which the contractors have been able to exploit by re-financing projects and realising considerable short-term profit soon after the construction phase of the project has been completed. <br> As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/may/10/privatefinance.interviews\">informed commentators</a> have shown, the result is that the government pays what it claims to be a rent in exchange for an asset to which a few services of relatively limited value have been attached (often worse than those previously provided within the state sector) and all this to disguise the fact that this is financial engineering simply designed to let the government move the PFI loan off its own books and so meet Gordon Brown's \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule_(fiscal_policy)\">golden rule</a>\" on borrowing. The result is that government accounts have been misstated, it has borrowed more than it could really afford according to that rule, and now it faces the ignominious prospect of overpaying banks it owns for the privilege of using inferior assets it should have financed itself at lower cost in the first place.<br> Quite obviously this cannot continue. Soon, new accounting rules will bring all liabilities, including PFI, on the government's balance sheet and will reveal just how expensive these arrangements are. And the myth that they are not a government liability, always known but never acknowledged, will be shattered.  More significantly though, if it can be shown that the government can produce cash, literally out of thin air, to fund the banks that so nearly failed while providing PFI finance, then it is obvious that the scheme makes no sense. Wouldn't it have been more sensible to have simply borrowed sensibly in the first place, at low rates, for projects subject to proper due diligence and contractual oversight, and pay for them using that age-old government financing mechanism called bonds? There was a golden era of bonds. It was from the late 19th century through to the end of the era of the postwar consensus. Bonds paid for local housing, trams and then buses, local waterworks, power stations and the entire infrastructure used to transform the quality of life for ordinary people in the first half of the 20th century. They were finance designed to suit a social purpose and provided a safe, secure, comprehensible medium for investment that paid unspectacular, but guaranteed, returns to the person who wanted to save for the long term in a medium they understood.  They could do the same thing again. This is exactly the sort of product that needs to back deposit accounts saved in the new mutual or state-owned savings banks that must also form part of the post crash financial architecture, based on Post Offices in all probability. And it is vital that we now have the infrastructure that these bonds can finance just as much as it is vital that the usurious PFI arrangements already in force be ended wherever possible.  It is vital that we know how our governments are funded and it is vital that the government provides the mechanisms people so clearly want to enable them to invest in the future of their own communities. Bonds do that.  PFI never did and never will. It is time to sweep them away and create a new, transparent investments and savings medium in which people can secure their own and their community's future.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead\">Radiohead</a>'s In Rainbows \u2013 an album that was freely available to download \u2013 has nevertheless sold more copies than either of the band's last two albums.</p> <p>And we're not counting free or cheap downloads as equal to a full-value CD purchase. No, even after In Rainbows was sitting on hard drives and iPods across the land, it still sold more CD copies than their previous two recent releases.</p> <p>Warner Chappell, Radiohead's publishers, made the announcement in a keynote presentation at the You Are In Control conference in Iceland, as reported by Music Ally magazine.</p> <p>In some of the first official figures to be released, Warner Chappell said that the CD version of In Rainbows has racked up 1.75m sales to date. Contrast this with sales figures from 2001's Amnesiac and 2003's Hail to the Thief, which as of late last year had sold 900,000 and 990,000 copies respectively, according to Hits Daily Double.</p> <p>In fact, even before In Rainbows was available in shops, Radiohead had already earned more money from its online sale than they had earned \u2013 in all formats combined \u2013 from Hail to the Thief.<br> Radiohead have sold 3m copies of In Rainbows, according to Warner Chappell. This number comprises physical CDs, box sets, and every download (even \u00a30.01 ones). 100,000 of the purchases were fancy \u00a340 \"disc boxes\", which alone makes for a handsome profit.</p> <p>Jane Dyball, Warner Chappell's Head of Business Affairs, said that the band and their management were monitoring the average price of pay-what-you-like downloads, with plans to end the service in anticipation of the album's iTunes release on December 10. By that point, avid fans had already bought the album, and the average price paid nosedived as downloads became the domain of idly curious freeloaders. </p> <p>Dyball also disclosed that the digital publishing income from Radiohead's pay-what-you-like downloads dwarfed all of the band's previous digital publishing income, and made a \"material difference\" to Warner Chappell's overall bottom line. In other words, it did extremely well.</p> <p>Maybe next time Radiohead can give the CDs away, too.</p>",
  "<p>On October 16 1998, a magistrate signed a warrant for the arrest of Senator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pinochet\">Augusto Pinochet</a> and changed the course of history. The former Chilean head of state was arrested a few hours later, at the request of a Spanish prosecutor who charged him with a raft of international crimes, some dating back to the early 1970s. Over the next 18 months, one <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/how-the-pinochet-affair-has-unfolded-706503.html\">dramatic development</a> followed another. The House of Lords rendered three landmark judgments in the space of five months; home secretary Jack Straw defied expectations by giving a green light to the continuation of proceedings that could lead to Pinochet's removal to Madrid; Pinochet made a dramatic appearance in the dock at <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9812/11/pinochet.01/\">Belmarsh magistrate's court</a>; and eventually Straw decided that Pinochet was too unhealthy to stand trial and he was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/2000/03/02/npin02.html\">returned to Chile</a> in April 2000. For the rest of his life he was dogged by legal proceedings. </p> <p>One central question lay at the heart of the whole affair: was a former head of state entitled to claim immunity before the English courts, where it was alleged that he had participated in crimes, in violation of international conventions, such as torture? This question had never before been decided. It pitted two competing views of international relations against each other: traditionalists argued that the maintenance of serene relations between states required the courts of one state to refrain from sitting in judgment over the highest officials of another; the modernists argued that no person was above the law where the most serious international crimes were involved, and that the system of human rights laws put in place after the second world war substituted a rule of immunity with a new rule against impunity. </p> <p>In March 1999, the House of Lords came down strongly in favour of the modernist view. It did so carefully, and in a way that was both reasonable and sustainable. The majority ruled that Pinochet's loss of immunity arose not from some unstated general rule of international law, but rather from the terms of a treaty to which Britain, Chile and Spain were party \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm\">1984 convention outlawing torture</a> \u2013 the terms of which were inconsistent with immunity for a former head of state. It is impossible to overstate the significance of that ruling, which reflected a new balance of global priorities, a shift in favour of principle over pragmatism. It has been followed by international indictments against other former heads of state \u2013 Slobodan Milosevic and <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/top/news/usnJOE492028.html\">Charles Taylor</a> \u2013 and the coming into force of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/law-humanrights\">international criminal court</a> and possible proceedings against the serving president of Sudan. It has also given rise to criminal proceedings before national courts in other parts of the world. The Pinochet judgment has withstood the test of time. It has not been overruled in the court of international opinion, and it has not brought international relations to a grinding halt.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it seems that Pinochet's case caused concerns at the highest levels of the Bush administration, as described in a revealing account by a former lawyer in the Bush administration, Jack Goldsmith. He <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Presidency-Judgment-Inside-Administration/dp/0393065502/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-3590333-4445548?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1188910280&amp;sr=8-1\">describes how</a>, during 2002, Henry Kissinger found himself on the sharp end of the Pinochet case. Reportedly livid, a rattled Kissinger complained to his old chum Donald Rumsfeld, who was already worrying about \"lawfare\" (the use of law to achieve operational objectives). Rumsfeld instructed the chief lawyer at the Pentagon, Jim Haynes, to address the problems posed by this \"judicialisation of international politics\". Haynes passed the assignment on to Goldsmith, whose memo reached the National Security Council, which also worried about the threat of foreign judges. According to Goldsmith, the NSC couldn't work out what to do about the problem. </p> <p>We now know that while this was going on, Rumsfeld and Haynes and others at the Pentagon were secretly circumventing international laws like the Geneva conventions and the torture convention and removing international constraints on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/usa-terrorism\">interrogation of detainees</a> at Guant\u00e1namo and in Iraq. Torture and other international crimes followed. So did the Abu Ghraib photos. Amid the welter of legal opinions received by the administration none, it seems, bothered to examine the consequences of the House of Lords judgment for senior US officials. </p> <p>The legacy of the arrest warrant signed in Hampstead 10 years today, is the Pinochet principle, that no one is above the law. It may one day come to haunt the very people who sought to set it aside. If, that is, they ever dare to set foot outside the United States.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 15 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Boom and bust</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown was accused by the Tories of \"irresponsibly\" having claimed to have abolished boom and bust as unemployment rose to its worst level since 1999. </p> <p>Harriet Harman, the leader of the Commons, acknowledged that ministers were \"very much concerned\" and not at all \"complacent\" about the jobless situation. </p> <p>Standing in for the prime minister, who was at a European summit, Harman said it was a \"serious moment\" for the economy and - using a slogan recently adopted by the Tory leader, David Cameron - insisted that Brown was a \"man with a plan\". </p> <p>William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, said that the lengthening dole queue marked a \"grim day\" for the economy. </p> <p>He branded Brown's boast to have abolished boom and bust \"one of the most foolish, one of the most hubristic, one of the most irresponsible claims ever made by a British prime minister\". </p> <p>Harman warned him against \"writing off\" the economy, which was made of \"sterner stuff,\" and insisted that the government was determined to take action to \"see this country through\". </p> <p><strong>Interest rates</strong></p> <p>The government was urged to press for a major interest-rate cut to ease pressure on families and avoid a recession turning into a deep slump. </p> <p>Rates are set by the Bank of England, but Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, urged ministers to end their \"vow of silence\" and openly call for the move. </p> <p>Harman told Cable: \"I don't really know what you are talking about in relation to interest rates. There was an interest rate cut last week and it was coordinated with other central banks across Europe and in America.\" </p> <p><strong>Banking</strong></p> <p>The government must provide a \"completely open\" statement of public sector liabilities in the wake of the \u00a337bn banking bail-out, Cable said. </p> <p>Uncertainty in the markets caused \"panic and loss of confidence\" and ministers had to set out the risks to the taxpayer of the part-nationalisation of three high street banks, he said. </p> <p>For the Tories, David Gauke attacked Brown's handling of the economy and called for clarification over the rescue package. </p> <p>He criticised the government's \"complacency\" and said that public finances were \"woefully unprepared\" for the downturn. </p> <p>Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, set out plans to repay the Treasury's contingencies fund and provide the extra cash for the banking bail-out. The amounts came to \u00a342.2bn, he added. </p> <p><strong>Iceland</strong></p> <p>John Healey, the local government minister, rejected demands to name three councils that are receiving help from emergency teams after getting into trouble because they had cash blocked in collapsed Icelandic banks. </p> <p>He said the information had been provided in confidence and appeared to suggest it could only be released when the councils gave permission. The government was doing \"everything we can\" to help town halls get their money back. </p> <p><strong>Charities</strong></p> <p>People are losing support from charities during the economic crisis because funds were blocked in Icelandic banks, Charlotte Atkins (Lab, Staffordshire Moorlands) warned. </p> <p>Atkins said that constituents depended on charities to support them during these \"difficult times\".</p> <p>Harman said small charities would receive 100% protection for their deposits and the government was \"taking steps\" to protect larger ones. </p> <p><strong>Bank of England</strong></p> <p>Andrew Tyrie (Con, Chichester) dismissed as \"complete nonsense\" suggestions that he used details of a private briefing from the Bank of England to write a newspaper article on bank recapitalisation. </p> <p>He insisted he had \"no knowledge of any secret briefings\" between the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, and the bank before writing the article. </p> <p><strong>Commons move</strong></p> <p>Commons and Lords sittings could temporarily move to other buildings while major maintenance work is carried out, it was revealed. </p> <p>Lord Brabazon of Tara, the head of Lords administration, said: \"The extensive scale of the work planned requires that a full range of options should be carefully considered. </p> <p>The House of Commons commission have therefore ordered a detailed feasibility study.\" </p> <p>No decision will be taken until all options have been fully assessed. </p> <p><strong>Equitable Life</strong></p> <p>Ministers were pressed by MPs to compensate Equitable Life policyholders left with reduced retirement savings. </p> <p>Graham Stuart (Con, Beverley and Holderness) said: \"Within the billions that are now being spent to sort out the financial system, surely it is right to rectify the injustice that has been visited on so many people who tried to be extremely prudent.\" </p> <p>In the debate Timms did not make any reference to Equitable Life. </p> <p><strong>Fuel bills</strong></p> <p>Energy companies need to \"play their part\" in helping families and businesses with rising fuel bills, Harman said. </p> <p>She told MPs increasing energy bills mostly affected \"those who can least afford it\" and urged utility companies to step up to the mark. </p> <p><strong>Rape</strong></p> <p>The defence of sleepwalking in rape cases is \"political correctness gone mad\" and should be outlawed, Harry Cohen (Lab, Leyton and Wanstead) urged. </p> <p>He told MPs it had become a \"loophole in the rape law\" and said there must be serious doubt that the Crown Prosecution Service would bring a case to court if the defence were to be used. </p> <p>Cohen's rape (defences) bill gained an unopposed first reading but stands little chance of becoming law. </p> <p><strong>Northern Ireland</strong></p> <p>Police officers in Northern Ireland face the biggest threat to their security for five years, the Ulster secretary, Shaun Woodward, warned. </p> <p>He told MPs: \"There have been a number of attacks on police officers. They have been marked by the cowardice as much as the criminality of those who have conducted them.\" </p> <p><strong>Cannabis</strong></p> <p>Police in Northern Ireland have seized cannabis worth \u00a350m in recent months, the Ulster minister, Paul Goggins, disclosed. </p> <p>He said they were making strides in dealing with the drugs problem. </p> <p>\"There has been considerable success in recent months in the closing down of 77 cannabis factories in Northern Ireland.\" </p> <p><strong>Memorial</strong></p> <p>The Ministry of Defence will be instructed to \"look favourably\" on plans for a memorial to the members of RAF Bomber Command who lost their lives in the second world war, Harman said.</p>",
  "<p>Red squirrels have been discovered that have immunity to a lethal pox virus that has wiped out large numbers of the animals in England and Wales.</p> <p>The finding is being seen as a sign of hope for the native species, which has seen dramatic declines across the country since the introduction of North American grey squirrels in the 19th century.</p> <p>The majority of grey squirrels are naturally resistant to the squirrel pox virus, but carry it in their blood. Scientists believe they pass it on to red squirrels when they mark their territory with scent.</p> <p>Anthony Sainsbury, a lecturer in wild animal health at the Zoological Society of London, led a team that asked people to send in dead red squirrels for autopsy. Tests identified eight red squirrels, one in Wales and seven from different colonies in northern England, with antibodies to the virus in the tissues. This suggests they had contracted the pox but had developed a resistance to it.</p> <p>\"It's good news because we've never detected this immunity before. It means it's feasible to protect them with a vaccine,\" said Sainsbury.</p> <p>\"The idea has been mooted before, but we haven't known for sure if the red squirrel would respond to a vaccine. What we'd like to do is develop a vaccine, which we would give to them either through bait or by trapping them,\" Sainsbury said.</p> <p>The scientists are unsure whether a small population of immune squirrels has existed for a long time, or whether the virus has become less lethal, allowing some squirrels to recently build up resistance to it. The study appears in the journal <a href=\"http://www.ecohealth.net/\">EcoHealth</a>.</p> <p>The effects of the virus have been devastating on red squirrel numbers. Infected squirrels develop painful lesions on their faces and underbellies and usually die of the disease within a week.</p> <p>A recent epidemic in an isolated squirrel colony in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/24/animalwelfare\">Sefton in Lancashire</a> has wiped out 60% of the animals. Studies have shown that where grey squirrels tread, reds die out 17 to 25 times faster.</p> <p>At the end of the 19th century, red squirrels were found throughout England and Wales in their millions, but are now restricted to Scotland, small parts of Cumbria, Northumberland and Lancashire and offshore islands.</p> <p>According to ZSL there are now thought to be fewer than 140,000 red squirrels in the UK, with just 15,000 in England. </p> <p>Sainsbury said: \"Immunity to the squirrelpox virus should give red squirrels a fighting chance against the grey invaders, without which red squirrels would undoubtedly be destined to lose the battle for survival in the UK.\" </p> <p>Currently, the only way to control the disease is to cull grey squirrels.</p>",
  "<p>I enjoyed a rare privilege last Friday, October 10 (which was <a href=\"http://www.iheu.org/node/1351\">world day against the death penalty</a>), attending a gathering of brave and principled people to whom the death penalty might be applied in a number of countries around the world because of their beliefs or lack of them. This was the <a href=\"http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/indexEvents.html\">conference</a> organised the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain to discuss apostasy \u2013 the \"crime\" of which all members of the Council are guilty \u2013 and associated questions about the place of religion and free thought in civil society.</p> <p>The members of the Council of Ex-Muslims are people who, having thought things through for themselves, have put aside the religion they were made to accept as children \u2013 a common enough feature of the adult attainment of reason among many \u2013 but in this case the religion is Islam, which regards apostasy as punishable by death.</p> <p>I wonder how many reading these words have sat in a gathering of people not a few of whom have received death threats because they think for themselves, and who have chosen a path not only personally dangerous but full of difficulty in relation to their families and communities \u2013 and who have done so because of reflectively chosen principle. It is a striking experience. In our relatively peaceful and tolerant western dispensations, disagreements of principle are rarely matters of murder; which is why some people find themselves incapable of grasping what last Friday's gathering signified.</p> <p>The symbolic import of the conference was great; the substance of the discussions was absorbing and important. It was about the nature of apostasy, the freedom to choose whether or not to have a religion, and to criticise religion whether or not one subscribes to it; the question whether there should be one and the same law for all or whether Britain's Muslim minority should be allowed to apply sharia law to itself; and the question of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+education/faithschools\">faith schools</a>, religious education and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/evolution.islam\">creationist doctrine</a>. The themes all related to the place of the individual in civil society, and whether religious doctrine should be allowed to impose itself on those unwilling to be governed by it or \u2013 as with children \u2013 powerless to resist it.</p> <p>The conference was opened by the head of the <a href=\"http://www.iransecularsociety.com/index.html\">Iranian Secular Society</a>, Fariborz Pooya, and addressed by the extraordinary and courageous Maryam Namazie, spokesperson of the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain, who subjected Islamism \u2013 political Islam \u2013 to scrutiny, arguing that it serves as an agency of Islamic states with serious implications for the lives, rights and freedoms of individuals, many of whom have left their countries of origin precisely to escape the repressive political and social climates there \u2013 countries with \"moral police\" and the death penalty for, among others, gay people, lovers who engage in extra-marital sex and people who reject religious orthodoxy.</p> <p>A source of frustration for many is that they are lumped into \"the Muslim community\" whose self-elected spokespeople are more representative of the Islamic states that many in their \"Muslim community\" have fled: which is why the Council of Ex-Muslims makes a point of calling itself this, to reinforce the point that not everyone who was born into a Muslim community has to be permanently forced into homogenised membership of it. Another reason is to encourage the many closet \"apostates\" in that community that there is life and succour outside it.</p> <p>Among those who spoke were Ibn Warraq, Joan Smith, Richard Dawkins, and the founder of Germany's Council of Ex-Muslims, Mina Ahadi, a woman as extraordinary and admirable as Maryam Namizie. It is a speaking fact that the lead in these eminently important and courageous movements is taken by women: from Lysistrata to the Northern Ireland women's peace movement, despite all the obstacles and prejudices that women have historically faced, they give a lead and an example which puts their opponents to shame.</p> <p>The conference was supported by the National Secular Society and the British Humanist Association, so that the dozens of ex-Muslims present had the support of over 200 others who believe in the right of individuals to think for themselves and who treat people as human individuals, not merely as bearers of overriding identity labels stuck to their foreheads by tradition and religion. A friend who is a crown court judge once told me that he is always pleased when a member of a jury affirms rather than swears the oath on the Bible, because it indicates independence and maturity of mind. Indeed: that was what was on display last Friday at Conway Hall.</p> <p>One of those speaking at the conference, my friend Ibn Warraq, recently <a href=\"http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutislam/fr/LeavingIslam.htm\">edited a book</a> on apostasy in Islam, which combines a scholarly overview of doctrines on apostasy in the various schools of Islamic law, with a collection of powerful personal testimonies by those who came to leave Islam either for another faith or none. It was interesting to compare the accounts there given with those in Louise Anthony's book <a href=\"http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Religion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195173079\">Philosophers Without Gods</a>, which collects similar accounts by ex-Christians and ex-Jews. The personal cost in family and community terms of rejecting the doctrines of any of these religions is very similar; only in Islam does the danger of being murdered for doing so remain.</p> <p>But, horribly, it is a genuine danger. That is why some of the speeches made during this conference, and some of the remarks from the floor, were filled with a passion and concern that were as real as they were moving. Not least among the matters that surfaced several times in different contexts was the question of the position of women in Islam. To take just one issue: in sharia law a woman is worth half a man, and thus among many other things receives half the inheritance that a man does. Like other provisions of sharia law, this is a stark example of contrast with the laws of England and Wales and with Scottish law, in both of which principles of justice do not countenance systematic discrimination on the basis of sex. By the oppressive requirements of conformity with community practices, many women in Muslim communities in Britain are obliged to observe the practices that the community prefers, across the whole range from whom they marry to what they wear.</p> <p>The establishment of sharia law courts would accordingly mean their often being obliged to suffer the injustice of deep discrimination. As with genital mutilation as practiced in some communities, and honour killings in others, that cannot be tolerated: relativism \u2013 which alas underwrites the views of some, like Rowan Williams, on this subject \u2013 has no place here.</p> <p>Nothing of what was discussed at this important and moving conference was anything but real: real lives subjected to death threats, discrimination, coercion and stigmatisation \u2013 and all because the people involved think for themselves, a right that the rest of us take for granted and, when it is threatened, jealously guard. It was a gentle and informal affair, with the relaxed flavour of a works outing: but there can have been no one there who did not at some point reflect that it was a juicy opportunity for some maniac to get rid of a whole raft of apostates and atheists in one big bang.</p> <p>The great thing is that the conference would have been a victory for what it represented if that had happened. As it was, it was anyway a victory and a much happier one: a victory for its brave sponsors and their brave cause.

  "<p>It was, as one pundit observed, the most we've heard about plumbers in connection with the presidency since the days of Richard Nixon. The clear winner of last night's presidential debate was \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Joe the plumber</a>\" - Joe Wurzelbacher, an Ohio man who met Barack Obama this week and told him he feared he'd raise his taxes. </p> <p>Both Obama and John McCain repeatedly invoked Joe's name at the final debate in New York state last night, each seeking to present their policies as the ones most appealing to the Everyman he represented. McCain said Obama's campaign-trail response to Wurzelbacher (he used the phrase \"spread the wealth around\") had smacked of \"class warfare\" - the first salvo in a night of attacks designed to put Obama on the defensive. But though McCain confronted his rival several times on the former Weather Underground co-founder Bill Ayers, and on the controversial voter-registration efforts of the Acorn organization, he failed to score the knockout blow he so badly needed. Obama addressed the Ayers issue, reminding viewers that his \"despicable\" acts had been committed when Obama was a young child; and over and over again he drew attention to McCain's efforts to shift the focus of the race from the economy. Instant polls of uncommitted voters all awarded the debate to the Democrat by big margins.</p> <p>McCain sought to turn the confrontation into a classic clash between conservatism and liberalism, Ewen MacAskill and Suzanne Goldenberg write in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">today's Guardian</a>. But despite giving his strongest performance in a general election debate, he struggled to control his all-too-evident annoyance, wearing a rigid grin for much of the evening that sometimes gave way to snorts of irritation. With the odds of victory now stacked against him, McCain is in a fix: voters seem to agree with the Obama position that McCain's attacks are diversionary tactics, greatly narrowing the range of effective lines of campaigning at the Republican's disposal.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in New Hampshire today, and McCain is in Pennsylvania; the two then converge on New York City for the Alfred E Smith Dinner, a campaign-trail fixture in aid of Catholic charities. McCain will also appear on the Late Show with David Letterman in what promises to be an awkward encounter: his booking on Letterman's show was one of the few things that McCain actually did cancel when he suspended his campaign last month, prompting on-air derision from the host.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>CNN's instant poll awarded last night's debate to Obama, 58% to 31%; CBS put it at Obama 53%, McCain 22%. Gallup's daily tracking poll showed a slight narrowing, at 52%-44% from 53%-43% the previous day, while Rasmussen's was unchanged a Obama 50% McCain 45%. A new Pew poll finds Obama leading at 49% to 42%, and shows that 47% of voters trust the Democrat to handle the economic crisis compared to 33% for McCain.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" John McCain delivers his soundbite of the night.<br>\"What could I possibly add? Life happens.\" Bill Ayers himself, confronted outside his university office by a Chicago reporter, makes it clear he'll be playing no part in the election campaign, however many times he's referred to by others.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama-johnmccain-final-presidential-debate\">McCain tries to fight his way back into contention during debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/15/uselections2008-barackobama\">Oliver Burkeman: Liveblogging the final presidential debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\">Who is 'Joe the Plumber' - aka Joe Wurzelbacher?</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/16/johnmccain-barackobama\">Obama v McCain, round three</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/15/uselections2008-barackobama2\">Pollsters say odds of McCain winning election are 'incredibly remote'</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/us/politics/16debate.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">NY Times: McCain Presses Obama in Final Debate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess16-2008oct16,0,2212181.story\">LA Times: McCain deals no lethal blows in final debate with Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/10/we_learn_joe_six_pack_is_a_plu.html\">Time: Now We Know Joe Six Pack Is A Plumber</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122411909182439021.html\">Karl Rove: Obama Hasn't Closed the Sale</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101600109.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Aggressive Underdog vs. Cool Counterpuncher</a></p> <h2>Mind-boggling hypothetical scenario of the day</h2> <p>Click around the Oval Office in a world where <a href=\"http://palinaspresident.com/\">Sarah Palin is president</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Over the past five years Tesla Motors has gained some high-profile fans including George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the founders of Google.</p> <p>But the Californian company \u2013 which makes electric cars, including a \u00a363,000 convertible which can reach speeds of 125mph \u2013 yesterday admitted it was losing money and said it would be cutting jobs and scaling back expansion.</p> <p>The announcement came after the company said it had failed to attract a further $100m investment because of the worldwide financial crisis.</p> <p>In a statement released on the Tesla website, the company said it was reshuffling its management team and making \"modest\" staff cutbacks. Elon Musk, the South African entrepreneur who was an early investor, will take control of day-to-day operations as the company's new chief executive.</p> <p>\"We have decided that the wise course of action is to focus on our two revenue producing business lines,\" Musk said in the statement. \"Our goal as a company is to be cashflow positive within six to nine months.\"</p> <p>Richard White, a clean technology analyst at research company Library House, said: \"The investment Tesla are looking for is quite significant, and it doesn't surprise me that they are finding it tough.</p> <p>\"Overall, if the company survives - which it probably will, given the backers - this will slow their growth.

  "<p>While around 98% of the clocks in Britain were set to Greenwich mean time by 1855, it was not made the law until 25 years later.</p> <p>A single time zone setting the baseline for the rest of the world was first proposed in 1876 when the engineer and inventor Sandford Fleming called for a global 24-hour clock. </p> <p>While this was not immediately put into action, he continued to agitate in this direction and eventually the theory of a universal day beginning at Greenwich midnight, but not interfering with local or standard time where appropriate, was agreed upon by the International Meridian Conference.</p> <p>By the 1930s most countries had adopted hourly time zones, but in some instances these differed within regions because of geography, distance or politics.</p> <p>This remains the case today, with a number of countries carrying different time zones between states.

  "<p>The financial sector bail-out is the biggest wealth transfer of all times, but who exactly has been bailed out and what does it do for the people at the bottom of the pile?</p> <p>The British government is spending nearly \u00a3500bn to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/banking.creditcrunch1\">bail out</a> banks by buying shares and providing liquidity, and more may follow. It has increased the guaranteed safety of bank deposits from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 per individual per bank. </p> <p>The bail-out is good news for banks' shareholders who were holding nearly worthless shares, and speculators who can continue to weave their deals. It may be good news for pension scheme members whose savings had been gambled on the stockmarket, or those lucky enough to have cash savings of \u00a350,000. But a large number of people do not have this level of savings, or a pension scheme, but are financing the bail-out.</p> <p>Income and <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=2\">wealth</a> inequalities have condemned many to a life of perpetual insecurity. The most recent government survey showed that in 2003 the country's wealthiest 1% owned 21% of the wealth and the wealthiest 50% owned 93%. If the value of dwellings was taken out then 1% of the wealthiest owned 34% of the wealth and the 50% of the least wealthy owned only 1% of the wealth. Some are lucky to own their <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7242492.stm\">house</a>, but now only 69.8% of the people in England live in an owner-occupied house. </p> <p>The deep income inequalities offer little chance of building cash savings of \u00a350,000 or a decent pension pot. The average pay for lead executives in the <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5huQ_bgovMI1AoVCVJXmV_KLJevvA\">FTSE 100</a> companies is around \u00a33.5 million a year. For the year to April 2007, the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/ashe1107.pdf\">median</a> annual pre-tax income of all UK workers stood at \u00a324,000. Twenty-five per cent earned less than \u00a312,000 a year and 75% of the workforce earned less than \u00a330,000 a year. The pre-tax <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=334\">income</a> of the top fifth of households was \u00a372,900 compared to \u00a34.900 for the bottom fifth. After tax and state benefits, the average final income was \u00a352,400 and \u00a314,400 respectively. </p> <p>An estimated 36% of people have cash <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7524214.stm\">savings</a> of less that \u00a3500 which would run out after just 11 days. A typical adult has savings of \u00a32,474 which will run out after 52 days. The government policy of protecting \u00a350,000 of bank deposits is of little direct relevance to a large number of people.</p> <p>The taxpayer-funded resuscitation of stockmarkets is good news for the well-off whose pension pot is tied up in stocks and shares. The average retirement pension for FTSE 100 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/12/executivesalaries.pensions\">executives</a> is around \u00a3200,000 a year. The pension pot of the outgoing chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/banking-executivesalaries\">Royal Bank Scotland</a> (RBS), a bank rescued by the taxpayer, is around \u00a38.4 million and he can look forward to a pension of \u00a3579,000 a year. In sharp contrast, final salary pension schemes for most employees have closed. Due to lack of resources, 85% of the under-thirties have no <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-560648/One-men-women-working-age-pension-savings-report-reveals.html\">pension</a>. Nine million under-50s are not saving in a pension. An estimated 11.6 million people aged between 16 and 65 have no private or company pension provision. </p> <p>The bailout is funded out of taxation, but the rich shy away from paying taxes. In 2006, Britain's 54 <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/corporate_law/article658376.ece\">billionaires</a> boasting a combined wealth of \u00a3126 billion are estimated to have paid income tax of only \u00a314.7 million. With tax avoidance schemes designed by leading accounting firms, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/dec/03/budget2005.politics6\">City</a> dealers paid themselves in gold bars, fine wines and persian carpets to avoid taxes. At the same time the <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=443786&amp;in_page_id=2&amp;ct=5\">poorest</a> 20% of the population pay nearly 40% of their total income in direct and indirect taxes, compared to 34.8% for the richest 20%.</p> <p>The bail-out might help small businesses get bank finance, improve availability of credit and provide indirect benefits to the less well-off but ignores a large number of people. Soon ministers will be telling us that because of the bail-out public finances are to be squeezed and local and central government departments will cut services and jobs. The burden will disproportionately fall on the less well-off. There is a little chance of a bail-out for the 13.2 million people living in <a href=\"http://www.ifs.org.uk/pr/hbai_pr1.pdf\">poverty</a>, or for 2.1 million pensioners and 3.9 million children living in poverty, or students starting life in debt. When will the government find money for social reform?</p>",
  "<p>No religious festival in Jerusalem would be complete without a controversial political incident, and this year's Yom Kippur was no exception. A group of nearly a hundred rightwing radicals forced their way on to the plaza of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dome_of_the_Rock\">Dome of the Rock</a>, one of the most sacred sites in Islam. Entering the precinct on Yom Kippur was a symbolic way of claiming Jewish sovereignty over the site many consider to be the location of the second temple, destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.</p> <p>While it is not unusual for events on the Temple Mount to trigger renewed Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2013 the second Palestinian intifada (uprising) was triggered in 2001 by then Israeli defence minister Ariel Sharon's controversial visit to the site \u2013 the latest events also have much to say about the current political situation in Israel itself. A growing current of hardline neo-Zionist militancy is terrorising Palestinians, leftwing Israelis and state authorities alike. As the Israeli government desperately tries to come to an agreement with the Palestinian Authority and undermine Hamas, the problem of evacuating settlements inhabited by violent ultra-nationalists will be near the top of a list of thorny challenges for the next Israeli administration.</p> <p>There is plenty of evidence that the right wing radical fringe is growing. In mid-September, over 200 vigilantes from the illegal West Bank settlement of <a href=\"http://www.jewishmag.com/117mag/yitzhar/yitzhar.htm\">Yitzhar</a> invaded the nearby Palestinian village of Asira al-Qibliyyah with guns and slingshots, in response to the stabbing of a Jewish boy from the settlement.</p> <p>But settler violence is not limited to attacks against Palestinians. Two weeks after the assault on Asira, leftwing Israeli professor Ze'ev Sternhell, a staunch critic of the settlement movement, was injured by a pipe bomb on his doorstep. It was widely assumed that rightwing activists placed it there, although the settlers' supporters were quick to accuse Israeli intelligence forces of launching a sinister leftwing conspiracy to discredit them. Later, prominent settler leader Daniela Weiss was <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127846\">arrested</a> for attacking Israeli police officers during the evacuation of the illegal settlement of Shvut Ami, giving a further indication of the gulf between Israeli state authorities and the radical right.</p> <p>It is clear that the rift has implications for the current round of talks with the Palestinians. Ehud Olmert, the outgoing Israeli prime minister, has argued that Israelis should abandon the Zionist utopia of the Greater Land of Israel, resorting instead to a territorial compromise in order to achieve peace with the Palestinians. After the events of September 13, Yitzhar's rabbi, David Dudkevich, who claims that the Arabs should emigrate from the \"Land of Israel\", launched a public tirade against the idea. Among other things, he endorsed the proposal of a separate state, Judea, which would be established alongside Israel should the latter decide to abandon the Zionist dream.</p> <p>\"It's obvious that a great many people who are secure in their Judaism feel emotionally distant from the state, which is in another place altogether,\" he told Haaretz newspaper. \"The state of Israel is not the be-all and end-all. If it decides it does not want to be in the hereditary lands of our forefathers, then other Jews have the right to organise themselves in order to live there, even without a link to the state. When there's talk about another expulsion, then on the ideological level, the 'State of Judea' is no worse than expulsion.\"</p> <p>The irony is that settler radicalism was nurtured by the Israeli state in the first place. Over the years, Likud governments in particular encouraged non-ideological Israelis to settle in the West Bank in the hope that they would adopt views that fitted the rightwing agenda of that party. It was also an effective strategy for gaining control of the Occupied Territories and guaranteeing that the maximum possible territory would be ceded to Israel should the US force her into a deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>However, the 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza placed the state authorities charged with implementing government policy \u2013 namely the police \u2013 at loggerheads with those settlers. The image of Israeli police forcibly evicting Jews from their homes created a wound in Israeli society that has been festering ever since. Several thousand young people who lived their entire childhoods in Gaza settlements now feel abandoned by the state and are willing to take out their frustration, often violently, against both Palestinians and the Israeli authorities.</p> <p>Thus the Israeli government now faces huge dilemmas in the context of the current round of Israeli-Palestinian talks and also in how it deals with its own citizens. If the implication of Olmert's comments is that more settlement evacuations are on the cards, and forcing that past a group of armed, radical settlers who have sworn their enmity to the state will be every bit as hard as negotiating an agreement with the Palestinians.</p>",
  "<p>I wanted to share something with you today that I think you can probably help me out with. It's about Phorm, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/mar/06/internet.privacy\">controversial behavioural ad company</a> that's partnered with British ISPs, including BT. We've written about them <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2008/sep/16/2\">quite a bit</a> in recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/sep/30/phorm.new\">months</a>.<br> Anyway, last week I got an email from one of BT's PR guys. As you can expect, we've had some fairly robust discussions with them recently. This time he was pointing out some <a href=\"http://www.journalism.co.uk/2/articles/532476.php\">comments from the Guardian's director of digital strategy</a>, Simon Waldman, who said recently that industry needed \"intelligent discussion\" about the issue of behavioural ads and that \"scaremongering\" was no good. </p> <p>BT's point, I suppose, was to suggest that we were stirring up exactly that sort of trouble and being hypocritical to boot.</p> <p>Fortunately, I have no problem with making trouble if it's required. I don't feel an overwhelming need to be neutral about things that are opposed to our civil rights. But I can try to be fair. </p> <p>So, in that spirit of fairness, I responded by sending back an email laying out an argument showing why I think Phorm is problematic, and why BT should spend more time worrying about why it's doing this than it does badgering its critics. I didn't get a response back from them, but I've included the text below because, to my mind, it articulates the problem pretty clearly. </p> <p>However: I want it to be better, because I think this is very important issue. And that's where you can help. I've tried to explain why people have a problem with Phorm and what the controversy is really about. But have I got it right? Do you disagree? Is there a way we can make this argument clearer, or more accurate? </p> <p>Read on for the relevant part of the email, and then leave suggestions, disputes or advice in the comments.</p> <blockquote> <p>Here's my problem with Phorm, in a nutshell, which might explain why I don't think we're going to stop writing about it any time soon:</p> <p>If you monitored the phone calls I made - not necessarily what was said in them, but who they were made to and when - and then sold my number on to cold callers for a commission, I'd get pretty pissed off. And most people, I'm sure, would feel pretty similar.</p> <p>Not just because cold calls are annoying - they are - but because it's an abuse of your privileged position as service provider.<br> BT is not running a website that users choose to visit. It's not running a service that users can switch away from easily. </p> <p>You're the gatekeeper. It's your job to protect your customers, not use what you know about them for commercial advantage. And it helps to be straight with them too, rather than this feeling that you're trying to get everything past them when they're not looking. </p> <p>It might not be against the law, but that doesn't mean it's not against the spirit of doing right by your customers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Your help appreciated.</p>",
  "<p>I almost feel bad for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>.</p> <p>I mean, I thought he was pretty good Wednesday night. He was effective at the beginning. He scored what I thought were some fair, clean shots at Obama on economic policy. He wasn't out of his depth talking about, say, education, which he's never really cared about. Pretty good job, I thought.</p> <p>And still, voters say <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> slaughtered him. </p> <p>By 53-22%, 638 uncommitted voters polled by CBS chose Obama as the winner. CNN was a little closer, 58-31%. All those other measures, who'll do better at blah blah and understands yada yada\u2026Obama, Obama, Obama.</p> <p>I actually don't understand it. I didn't even think Obama was quite on his game. He should have gotten much the better of the economic-crisis debate, but it seemed to me that McCain represented his proposals slightly better than Obama represented his. I even sort of thought that during the abortion segment (although I bet pro-lifers didn't \u2013 McCain may have lost more than a few of them by wandering from the talking points on Roe v. Wade).</p> <p>So what's the explanation for this? There can only be two, I suppose \u2013 the personal and the political, to paraphrase the first-generation feminists. Maybe it's just about McCain. Maybe he just looks like he's ready for the glue factory. It's funny, he doesn't necessarily look that way to me. To me, he just looks like John McCain, the guy I've been watching do this and that for 20 years. He's 20 years older, sure. But so am I. Naturally, I don't look much older to me. So why should he?</p> <p>But of course I'm not most people. Most people haven't been watching McCain do this and that for 20 years. And for those people, I think he does look very old indeed. He sounds old, even more than he looks old. You can hear him wheezing. That whistle every time he makes an S sound. </p> <p>That's an old American stock character in the movies and sitcoms of my youth. The man whose lawn has just been trampled by a young mischief-maker and who storms (such as a septuagenarian can storm) out of the house yelling, \"I'll get you, sonny!\" and the S in \"sonny\" sounds like the air shooting through the gaps in the teeth. So maybe he just comes across like that and there's nothing to be done about it.</p> <p>The other theory of the personal is of course the angry petulance. Again, this is something that I guess I'd quit even noticing about McCain some time ago. But now that I think about it, I have noticed it in these three debates. Obama is Mr. Cool, whether what he's saying makes sense or not. Cool is better than hot, as Marshall McLuhan said ages ago.</p> <p>Or, maybe it's the politics. Maybe 90% of the people who are usually swing voters are just so disgusted with the Republicans that they're not going to entertain the idea of voting for McCain under any circumstances. Maybe it's just over for the Republicans for the foreseeable future, until the Democrats screw up.</p> <p>Whatever it is, I am surprised at the universality of it. Even the much-anticipated Ayers moment came and went like nothing. It lasted three minutes, from 9:37 to 9:40. Obama was ready for it. He answered it well. Issue done. </p> <p>I don't know what McCain does next. Just plays it out, I suppose. He should really lay off the personal attacks at this point and just do his best. If he continues to go for the jugular, if his rallies still get ugly and he doesn't calm them down, if 100% of his television advertising is still attack-based, he now risks permanent damage to his reputation. </p> <p>It isn't over, and outside events can always change things. But the debates en toto make it clear that he can't win this the way he's been running for the last three weeks. And if he keeps it up he risks losing more than an election.</p>",
