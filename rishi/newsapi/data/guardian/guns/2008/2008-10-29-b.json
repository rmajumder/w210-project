  "<p>It's back to the future with Pakistan's latest response to the Taliban insurgency. With endorsement and limited training from the US, and Chinese-manufactured weapons, Pakistan will arm tribal militias, or lashkars, to fight the Taliban. Led by tribal chiefs (or \"maliks\") marginalised by the Taliban, and with their knowledge of local conditions and mores, Pakistan hopes that the lashkars will be able to defeat the jihadi movement and win the battle for the hearts and minds of tribal communities.</p> <p>The Taliban killed hundreds of maliks as it swept into Pakistan's tribal areas following the US invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The maliks were often hated by tribal communities because of their harsh and despotic rule. As a result, many people initially greeted the Taliban as liberators replacing the malik feudalism with their ostensibly Islamic brand of social ordering. </p> <p>But that goodwill soon ran out as tribal communities faced the full force of the Taliban's rigid social dictates. All of a sudden people were being brutally punished or killed for refusing to fight with the Taliban and schools and music shops were being bombed.</p> <p>According to the noted Pakistani scientist and political commentator Prof Pervez Hoodbhoy of Qaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, the lashkar strategy is an attempt to \"enable tribal people who now hate the Taliban for their fanatical excesses to fight for their survival under the leadership of their [maliks].\" </p> <p>Unfortunately, as Hoodbhoy sees it, there is very little else Pakistan can do because \"the mantra of development and poverty reduction ... is impossible while the bullets are flying\".</p> <p>The depressing reality is that very little has changed in this part of the world over the intervening centuries. </p> <p>\"The British used lashkars when fighting tribal insurgents [in areas now known as the North-Western Frontier Province]. The Mughals [who ruled India before the British] did it too, so did other rulers,\" says Prof Anatol Lieven, a Pakistan observer from King's College, London.</p> <p>The Taliban have already reacted to the lashkars swiftly and brutally \u2013 80 members of a lashkar from Matt in the north-western mountains of Swat were abducted. Another 50-100 were killed by a suicide bomber while enlisting in Bajaur. Similar attacks in Orakzai and Khyber Agency last week claimed the lives of eight and 100 people respectively.</p> <p>The strategy comes at a time when Pakistan's civilian government is desperate to show unified leadership to its population and the world. Those plans hit a snag last week when, spearheaded by the main religious and secular opposition parties, both houses of Pakistan's parliament <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/pakistan-us-foreign-policy-terrorism\">passed a resolution</a> calling for dialogue with the Taliban and an end to military operations in Pakistan's tribal areas. </p> <p>\"This amounts to de-facto acceptance of a horrifically brutal Taliban state [in many of Pakistan's tribal areas],\" Hoodbhoy argues. </p> <p>Yet calls for negotiating with the Taliban are also starting to emanate from across the border in Afghanistan as well. </p> <p>As I mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/24/pakistan-us-foreign-policy-terrorism\">a previous article</a> for Cif, high officials \u2013 from Britain's top soldier and diplomat in Afghanistan, the UN's special envoy and the French army chief \u2013 have already concluded that peace can only be secured in the country through dialogue with the Taliban. </p> <p>Gen. David Petraeus \u2013 soon to be supreme commander of US forces in the Middle East and Central Asia \u2013 believes that <br>http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081008/ts_nm/us_afghan_usa_petraeus<br>negotiations with the Taliban could, in part, reduce the violence in Afghanistan. His sentiments are shared by others in the US Defence establishment. \"Ultimately,\" says US Defence Secretary Robert Gates, \"there has to be... reconciliation as part of a political outcome to this.\"</p> <p>These developments represent an indirect admission that the rush to invade Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks has not created greater international peace and security.</p> <p>Despite this, the likelihood of an immediate, peaceful resolution of the Taliban insurgency in Pakistan remains low. Under intense pressure from the US, the Pakistan Army has launched major military operations in Bajaur and Swat, tribal areas with strong Taliban insurgencies. Every day Pakistan's Army boasts of killing more militants \u2013 it claims to have killed 1,500 militants in Bajaur since August alone. </p> <p>The US too has accelerated its unilateral missile strikes in Waziristan, the tribal region on Pakistan's side of the Durand Line that is perhaps the Taliban's most robust stronghold. Just yesterday a suspected US missile strike <a href=\"http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle08.asp?xfile=data/international/2008/October/international_October1985.xml&amp;section=international\">killed 20 people</a> in Dera Ismail Khan. The US strikes have led some to argue that the Bush administration is seeking an \"<a href=\"http://harpers.org/archive/2008/09/hbc-90003588\">October surprise</a>\".</p> <p>Such military strikes, particularly those carried out by Pakistan, have had <a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/db/blogs/54127/2008/09/1-155515-1.htm\">a devastating impact</a> on tribal societies. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that around 310,000 people have been displaced by the conflict. Estimates of civilian casualties range from 300 to 1,500. </p> <p>There is, sadly, no reason to presume that fiercely independent and opportunistic tribal lashkars will prevent this human disaster. As Rahimullah Yousufzai, perhaps the pre-eminent Pashtun journalist in Pakistan, <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE49N2MF20081024\">told Reuters</a>, \"if these lashkars expel militants then it's OK but there's no guarantee the lashkars won't get out of control and become personal militias of tribal elders.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.khabrein.info/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17816&amp;pop=1&amp;page=0&amp;Itemid=57\">Another concern</a>, voiced by Senator Mualana Saleh Shah from South Waziristan, is that the lashkar proposal could \"further worsen the situation in the tribal areas\" by pitting tribe against tribe.</p> <p>Pakistan's tribal areas have a long history of regional hegemons, from the British to the Pakistanis, playing off one antagonist against another in a bid to vicariously control the entire region. Its people are well aware of this history.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://crss.pk/Fata/FATA_Survey_Aug2008.ppt\">a survey</a> [Powerpoint] conducted by a Pakistani thinktank in the federally administered tribal areas in August, 77% of residents do not welcome the Pakistani army. Lashkars that are seen as abusing their power to lord over the population may be equally unwelcome, if not more so. </p> <p>The Taliban was able to build safe havens in Pakistan's tribal areas because successive Pakistani and British administrations neglected the region's social and economic welfare. Even if the lashkars are successful in driving out the Taliban, they do nothing to assist in integrating Taliban-affected tribal areas with the rest of Pakistan.</p>",
  "<p>Will every vote cast this election season count? Of the possible snafus that could occur on November 4, from malfunctioning voting machines to insufficient ballots, one issue that hasn't gotten much attention is provisional voting. Essentially a stop-gap measure, provisional balloting assures that people whose names do not appear on voter registration lists due to bureaucratic errors (or who have other troubles) can exercise their right to vote.</p> <p>Provisional voting got traction after the administrative debacle of the 2000 presidential election when millions of people were turned away from the polls, many because of problematic voter rolls. Two years later, Congress mandated provisional voting nationwide as part of a larger package of election reforms known as the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/hava/hava.htm\">Help America Vote Act</a> or HAVA, to insure that everyone who is eligible to vote can. End of story, right? Not quite. </p> <p>Today, many state and local election officials despise provisional voting. Why? Even within a state, provisional voting requirements can be subject to conflicting interpretations by election officials. Sorting out who should get a provisional ballot on election day and researching voter eligibility afterwards is a confusing and time-consuming exercise. </p> <p>So stuff happens. The Pew Centre for the States/Electionline.org's <a href=\"http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Election Preview FINAL.pdf\">Election 2008 Preview</a> (pdf) documents that in more than half of the states that use provisional ballots, a person who thinks they are registered must vote in the correct precinct. Go to the wrong polling place, and your vote won't get tabulated. Some poll workers even use provisional ballots to pacify irate people in situations where the ballot may not solve the actual problem, such as missing the voter registration deadline. (Most state cutoffs fall in early or mid October.)<br> In Massachusetts, residents also get tripped up by a quirk in the <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/nvra/activ_nvra.php\">national motor voter law</a> which permits a person to register to vote when he or she applies for a driving license. Here's how it works: Say you move from Provincetown on Cape Cod to Boston and opt to change your address online. Most people forget or don't know that they must go in person to a <a href=\"http://www.mass.gov/rmv/express/index.htm\">state registry of motor vehicles</a> office and fill out another form so that the changes get forwarded to the new city or town. </p> <p>Miss this step and once again you're out of luck at the friendly neighbourhood polling place. \"We will no doubt have many people because they have relocated for whatever reason looking to try to vote and not be on the rolls,\" said Massachusetts secretary of state William Galvin, the Bay State's <a href=\"http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/\">top election official</a>.</p> <p>To cut down on people needing provisional ballots, Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, today signed into law a change that would allow some voters who failed to re-register within 18 months of moving to go back to their old neighbourhoods to vote in the presidential and state races only. But local election officials fear that the move will create more problems than it solves, since poll workers won't have enough time to figure out how the process should work.<br> Worse still, when people vote provisionally, most fail to check the status of their ballot after the election. If the ballot wasn't counted, the person never finds out and, consequently, doesn't take the necessary steps to correct the error. So the cycle can start all over again in the next election, likely creating a permanent sub-class of voters who use provisional ballots, but whose votes never count. About three million people turned out for the <a href=\"http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2004G.html\">2004 presidential election in Massachusetts</a>. A little more than 10,000 provisional votes were cast. Only about 2,300 were validated. Yet if election officials in true-blue Massachusetts, where elections run smoothly for the most part, are seizing up over the prospect of dealing with provisional voting while coping with a turnout of epic proportions, imagine the nightmares of officials in states with less-than-stellar track records like Florida or Ohio, where the outcome of the presidential race is not at all assured.<br> Add in a shortage of poll workers and the likelihood that provisional voting will muck things up multiplies, especially in locales with tight races. Just last week, federal election officials announced the <a href=\"http://www.eac.gov/News/press/preparing-for-historic-voter-turnout-eac-renews-call-for-poll-workers/base_view\">need for some two million volunteer poll workers nationwide</a>. \"I hope that election officials in every state are ready for this,\" said former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, now a political science professor at <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/neuhome/index.php\">Northeastern University</a>.<br> Not everyone is sweating bullets. Eight states allow residents to register and vote on election day: Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Exempt from the HAVA provisional voting requirements, this cohort also posts some of the highest voter-turnout numbers in the country. (North Dakota doesn't have statewide registration, while North Carolina residents can vote anywhere from three to 19 days before the election.) </p> <p>This year, 24 states including Massachusetts tried and failed to pass comparable laws. Diane Jeffery, president of the <a href=\"http://www.lwvma.org/\">League of Women Voters of Massachusetts</a>, believes that provisional voting is necessary to prevent some people from being denied the right to vote. But she believes there is a better way. \"I would rather see election day registration than have to go through this kind of process,\" she said.<br> If provisional voting contributes to chaos this time around, count on lawmakers and civic leaders in states across the country to embrace election day registration and move to toss a well-meaning but frustrating procedure into the dustbin of history.</p>",
  "<p>It's rarely good when my country makes world news, except about sport. Last week a <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24546345-26040,00.html\">car exploded</a> in downtown Zagreb. It happened a couple of hundred metres from the parliament building. In this typical mafia execution, two people were killed: the publisher/journalist Ivo Pukanic and one of his employees. </p> <p>Why should the deaths of these two men be reported around the world? It is a symptom of something much bigger and more serious, of long-standing criminal activity going unpunished. The bomb was met by a frenzy of statements by Croatia's politicians, the president declaring dramatically: \"Now it is either them or us!\" </p> <p>The government acted as if it was totally surprised, as if something like this had never happened before. But only two weeks ago the daughter of a well-known and politically involved lawyer was executed at point-blank range. A top manager was badly beaten up, another journalist is still recovering from having almost been killed. What these recent cases have in common is that those who gave the orders were never found. Moreover, the investigation gives the impression that nobody is even looking for them. </p> <p>In the last few years, killings of mafia bosses have occurred in the centre of the city, but perhaps not close enough to the circles of power. Ivo Pukanic's murder, however, seems to be too close to it: he was known for being well-connected, with one leg firmly in the criminal world and the other in the political one. No wonder that his murder shook the government and was interpreted as a political message. </p> <p>For the first time it became fearfully evident that the institutions of the state designated to protect citizens are not capable of doing their job. The explosion in the centre of Zagreb is a result of almost two decades of deliberate neglect of serious crimes. The problem \u2013 far from being unique to Croatia, of course \u2013 is the elaborate network of criminals, politicians, big business and the police. There is a picturesque word for it in Italy: octopus. Even the state public attorney recently lamented in the press the involvement of organised crime in the police and the judicial system. The president of the parliamentary national security council confirmed that criminals had infiltrated the very centre of power.<br> Apparently this is common knowledge, a banality so to speak. Therefore, the problem is not that nobody knew about such connections, just the opposite \u2013 that everybody profited from them. The paralysis of the state institutions was a deliberate one. If too many people too high up are corrupted, who is to throw the first stone? Until an event like the murder of Pukanic threatens to reveal these connections. </p> <p>There is an atmosphere of fear in Zagreb, perhaps even a danger of destabilisation. In such a situation yesterday's enemies from the opposition are now offering their support to prime minister Ivo Sanader who is promising a tough fight against crime. A few days after the killing of Pukanic a special anti-mafia squad was formed and 250 policemen from the provinces brought to the capital. Just before that, heads were already rolling, the ministers of interior and of justice were replaced overnight. But can all these measures really work? Besides political will and determination to fight crime and corruption, one needs an efficient apparatus. Perhaps the fear of social breakdown and events spinning out of control could be strong enough motivation for state institutions to take their job seriously this time. But in that case there remains one small question: how can the political establishment direct all these forces against \u2013 possibly \u2013 itself?</p>",
  "<p>Being on the road, you get a newspaper at your hotel room door every morning. Yesterday, I was reading USA Today, and they have a fascinating story about Barack Obama's fundraising appeal even to executives in some industries who four years ago <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-10-27-prez-money_N.htm?csp=Daily%20briefing\">donated to the Bush campaign rather to John Kerry</a>. This story explains why John McCain is struggling even with traditional Republicans in big business. </p> <p>Occasionally, I come across a quote that sums up the state of the race so succinctly that it just stands out. Four years ago, it was when my father said that he didn't want Bush to win but couldn't bring himself to vote for John Kerry. Even Democrats I've spoken to on this trip talk about how John Kerry's campaign was ineffectual and the candidate uninspiring. </p> <p>Folks in the UK always ask me how Americans could vote for Bush. There's your answer. You may not agree with it, but to put it bluntly, John Kerry sucked as a candidate. I'm sure that you've had Labour candidates that you had to force yourself to vote for even if the thought of voting for a Conservative made you ill. Democrats didn't vote for John Kerry. They voted against George Bush, and the ABB (Anybody but Bush) crowd wasn't big enough to win that election. If the election would have been held even six months later, it might have been. </p> <p>But let's return to 2008. In this election, this story really explains the uphill battle that McCain is fighting in the closing days of this election, a defensive battle to win back traditional Republican voters, even on issues such as taxes. </p> <p>They interviewed Bob Clark, the CEO of Clayco, a large real estate development firm in St Louis. Clark raised thousands of dollars for George Bush in 2000 but has raised half a million dollars for Obama in this election. They also spoke to Victor Hammel, the CEO of a pest-control company in Pennsylvania, another key swing state. The killer quotes? </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Barack is definitely more liberal than I am,\" Clark said. \"But I'm willing to compromise on some of those issues for what I think is the greater good.\"</p> <p>Hammel said, \"I would rather pay a little higher tax on a higher profit than a lower tax rate on lower profits.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This shows you the shift in this election from four years ago. If John McCain can't win on taxes with CEOs, then he's running out of arguments that will sway voters with less than a week to go from the election.</p>",
  "<p>A new presidential administration comes with quite a long to-do list. You have to write lots of new jokes for late-night TV shows, you have to immediately start printing bumper stickers abdicating responsibility for the new president-elect (ie: \"Don't blame me, I voted for ______!\"), and of course, you have to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/26/AR2008102602505.html\">stock up on your guns</a>.</p> <p>Wait. What? </p> <p>Apparently, it's true. In this wondrously bad economy, one industry is experiencing a surge in business. Gun sales are <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27393833/\">up 8% to 10% this year</a> and according to the gun buyers themselves, this is due to one of two fear-laden factors. </p> <p>First, neither presidential candidate instills total confidence in the heart of the gun owner when it comes to preserving their interpretation of the second amendment. <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/barack_obama_gun_control.htm\">Senator Obama</a> has said that though he supports an individual's right to bear arms, he also believes in \"common-sense safety measures\". In the past, this has meant that he endorsed an Illinois handgun ban, co-sponsored a bill to limit gun purchases to one per month and he is in favour of banning semi-automatics, among other precautions. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/domestic/john_mccain_gun_control.htm\">Senator McCain</a> has a vastly different relationship with guns and gun control. He voted for prohibiting lawsuits against gun manufacturers and he voted against the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act\">Brady act</a>. McCain also voted to maintain current laws allowing guns to be sold without trigger locks. But his potential presence in office does not ameliorate the concerns of gun owners, who are disturbed by his previous tendencies towards a modicum of gun control (i.e. he has voted for requiring background checks on individuals purchasing guns at a gun show). So while McCain is certainly more gun-friendly than his opponent, he's definitely not the golden child of gun ownership.</p> <p>Obviously, and without further discourse, that title would fall to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199140/\">good old shoot 'em from the chopper</a> Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Second, the downward spiral of the economy has instilled fear into the heart of most Americans. Many gun owners believe that a surplus of weaponry and ammunition will protect them from the consequences of unhappy times. Anticipating an increase in crime and a decrease in availability of firearms and accessories in the new administration, people are endeavouring to protect themselves through the mobilisation of their second amendment rights.</p> <p>This is, of course, speaking in generalities. Not all gun owners plan on voting for McCain, despite the NRA's very <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/09/nra-endorses-mccain-palin-ticket/\">prominent endorsement</a> of the Republican candidate. The organisation called Senator Obama the most anti-gun would-be president in history. Those voters going against the grain in the microcosm of gun enthusiasts cite economic and health care concerns as more worrisome than the stability of their right to bear arms. Of course, they're making sure they own plenty of weapons now so that their collection can be grandfathered in when times change. </p> <p>This increase in gun sales is not a new trend for the US. Purchases jumped in 1994 after President Clinton advocated for a ban on semi-automatic rifles. Sales spiked after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/16/virginiatech.usgunviolence\">April 2007's killings</a> on the Virginia Tech campus. Gun ownership went up in 2006 when the housing bubble first popped in certain regions of the country, and continued to rise after every market dive. Despite the foreclosures left and right, unsteady gas prices and the staggering cost of groceries, a good percentage of Americans today are making room in the budget for new guns, as they seem to believe this will protect them from the imminent collapse of the economy and social justice.</p> <p>I suppose people cope with fear in a lot of different ways. What is alarming about this particular coping mechanism is that unlike biting one's nails, grinding one's teeth or hitting the cookie dough pretty hard, this particular habit has the potential to dramatically affect others well-being and perception of safety. </p> <p>So what say, candidates? How do you plan on addressing an increasingly divided, increasingly panicked population that is continuously arming itself at an unprecedented rate? Let me know when you have an answer. I'll be over here, head first in the cookie dough.</p>",
  "<p>Members of the National Black Police Association (NBPA) probably did not expect the keynote speaker at their annual conference to suggest the organisation might be guilty of racism. </p> <p>But that's what happened when an invitation mix-up led to the wrong MP addressing the event. </p> <p>Instead of the former shadow home secretary David Davis, his near namesake David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, was invited - and delivered a highly critical speech. </p> <p>Davies said the body's policy of only allowing ethnic minorities to have full membership could be considered \"explicitly racist\". </p> <p>He said the NBPA - which is backing and funding the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Tarique Ghaffur, in his race discrimination case against the force, should \"check the truth\" of discrimination claims before going to court. </p> <p>The Tory claimed it was \"human nature\" for people to blame race rather than lack of talent when rejected for promotion, the Public Servant Daily reported. </p> <p>\"To me, it is a shame that full membership of the NBPA is open only to those of black, Asian or Middle Eastern origin,\" he told the conference in York. </p> <p>\"Tackling racism and unfair treatment of ethnic minorities is something which is taken seriously by members of every race in the police force, and yet the clear implication is that white people do not share this concern.</p> <p>\"It could be argued that this policy is explicitly racist, in that it bars white people, and implicitly racist in suggesting that white people care less about racism than people of black, Middle Eastern, Asian or African origin.\" </p> <p>The NBPA general secretary, Stafford Brooks, said: \"There was an invitation sent out ... the wrong David Davies turned up.\" </p> <p>\"Clearly, he did say some controversial things and it was quite upsetting for some of our members.

Brand is reportedly now on his way to Los Angeles. </p> <p>\"I have apologised to Andrew Sachs for the rude messages I left on October 18 and he has graciously accepted,\" Brand said.</p> <p>\"As I only do the radio show to make people laugh I've decided that given the subsequent coverage I will stop doing the show,\" he added.</p> <p>\"I've loved working for the BBC and am very proud of the shows myself, Matt Morgan, Nic Philps, Mr Gee and Noel Gallagher have made and I apologise to all of them for damaging their careers - except Noel, whose band are doing quite well. </p> <p>\"I got a bit caught up in the moment and forgot that at the core of the rude comments and silly songs were the real feelings of a beloved and brilliant comic actor and a very sweet and big hearted young woman. </p> <p>\"Apologies are also owed to the loyal listeners of the show who enjoyed its shambolic spirit and anarchy and will be upset that it cannot continue. </p> <p>\"I take complete responsibility and offer nothing but love and contrition and I hope that now Jonathan and the BBC will endure less forensic wrath. Hare Krishna.\"</p> <p>Ross said he had previously not made a public apology as he intended to make one on his BBC1 chatshow, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, which was due to be recorded this evening.</p> <p>However, the show was cancelled earlier today after the BBC suspended both Ross and Brand over the row, pending the outcome of an investigation - the preliminary findings from which are due to be presented to the BBC Trust by the director general, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/markthompson\">Mark Thompson</a>, tomorrow.</p> <p>\"I am deeply sorry and greatly regret the upset and distress that my juvenile and thoughtless remarks on the Russell Brand show have caused,\" Ross said.</p> <p>\"I have not issued a statement previously because it was my intention and desire to offer an apology to all those offended on my Friday night programme,\" he added.</p> <p>\"However, it was a stupid error of judgment on my part and I offer a full apology.\"</p> <p>Sachs said of Brand's decision to quit: \"I respect his decision. I hope he moves forward, I really hope he does.\"</p> <p>Baillie told the Sun she was \"thrilled\" the pair had been suspended and that \"justice has been done\".</p> <p>A parliamentary motion criticising the prank calls has also been signed by 13 MPs. </p> <p>The BBC has spent the day battled to bring the row under control, announcing that it was suspending Ross and Brand, with their shows - Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and Ross' Saturday morning Radio 2 show and Brand's Saturday night Radio 2 programme - taken off air.</p> <p>Thompson, who is flying back from holiday in Sicily this evening to take control of the situation, is due to receive a report by director of audio and music Tim Davie into the row.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England</a> failed to respond to the warning signs of a looming recession and has wrongly delayed cutting interest rates until it was too late to stop growth contracting and unemployment rising sharply, according to one of the nine members of its monetary policy committee.</p> <p>In outspoken criticism of his MPC colleagues, David Blanchflower said Threadneedle Street had been too optimistic about the ability of the economy to survive the global financial crisis with only a modest downturn in activity and that Britain would now endure 18 months of falling output as it felt the full impact of the credit crunch.</p> <p>Blanchflower was a lone voice calling for cuts in interest rates from the MPC during the summer and used a speech in Canterbury, Kent to say that the other members had been wrong to ignore his warnings.</p> <p>\"With hindsight, monetary policy has not been sufficiently forward looking. Changes in monetary policy only affect the real economy with a substantial lag. It is not sufficient to consider the data month by month until it emerges that the UK is in recession. </p> <p>\"I believe the trend has been apparent for some time. The synchronised downturn in so many business surveys should have led us to realise sooner that the UK economy was entering a recession.\"</p> <p>Pressing for a hefty cut in borrowing costs when the MPC meets next week, Blanchflower added: \"If rates are not cut aggressively we do face the prospect of a relatively deep and long-lasting recession\".</p> <p>The Bank cut interest rates by half a point to 4.5% earlier this month as part of the co-ordinated global response to the financial turmoil, and the City is expecting a reduction of at least a similar size a week today. Some analysts are calling for rates to be shaved by a percentage point.</p> <p>Blanchflower said policy makers were faced with an \"unusually severe\" international financial problem. </p> <p>\"It is even possible that this event may turn out to be more significant than the 1929 Crash which principally involved bank failures in the US. The current difficulties in financial markets are more global in nature and more comparable to what happened in world war one, when stock exchanges in several countries were closed for extended periods.\"</p> <p>The other members of the MPC were reluctant to cut rates during the summer as inflation rose to a 16-year-high of 5.2% in September. When inflation deviates by more than a percentage point from the Treasury's 2% target, the Bank's governor, Mervyn King, is obliged to write an explanatory letter once a quarter to the chancellor, Alistair Darling, and two have been sent from Threadneedle Street so far this year.</p> <p>Blanchflower said the MPC had over-reacted to the threat that higher imported oil and food prices would trigger a repeat of the 1970s inflationary spiral, and that the real risk during the summer had been of looming recession. The bargaining power of workers was much weaker than in the 1970s, with little chance that they could push up wages in response to rising prices.</p> <p>\"UK output will continue to contract in 2008 and through 2009\", Blanchflower said. \"At the same time CPI (consumer prices index) inflation is likely to fall back sharply over the next year or so to well below the 2% target. My concern is that inflation will be below 1% - and may be even negative - and the MPC will then be writing letters on the low side, which is not a healthy prospect.\"</p> <p>In its last health check on the economy, released in August, the Bank said it expected output to be broadly flat over the coming year, with employment falling a little. Output growth was expected to recover in 2009 as energy prices fell, the credit crunch eased and a weaker pound helped exports. \"This was an optimistic view\", Blanchflower said. \"Clearly output is now begninning to contract, but I think this likelihood was apparent in August.\"</p> <p>He added that at last month's MPC meeting some members had argued that there was a case for higher borrowing costs. \"That was not my view. At that meeting I was alone in voting for an immediate cut in bank rate by half a percentage point.</p> <p>\"I am concerned about the detrimental effect of recent events in financial markets on the UK economy\", Blanchflower said, adding that the 0.5% drop in GDP in the third quarter had occured mainly before this Autumn's market meltdown.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats have criticised the idea of a \"responsibility contract\" between broadcasters and the government floated by the Conservatives today, arguing that it would threaten the basic tenets of the freedom and independence of UK media.</p> <p>Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Don Foster said state meddling in TV programming would be \"a very sad day for British broadcasting\".</p> <p>Foster was responding to Tory culture spokesman Jeremy Hunt, who earlier today argued that the BBC Radio 2 broadcast of offensive phone calls by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to former Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs was a \"perfect example\" of where the concept of a \"responsibility deal\" could operate.</p> <p>The Lib Dem MP said: \"Despite the unacceptable behaviour of Brand and Ross it is vital that we maintain truly independent public service broadcasting ... we already have a regulatory and legal process to deal with such issues.</p> <p>\"The entire point of having an independent media is to prevent those in power from having undue influence over what appears on our screens.\"</p> <p>Foster added that Hunt's idea for a \"social responsibility contract\" raised \"huge questions about the \"freedom of the media and state interference\".</p> <p>Hunt said that in return for \"lighter touch\" regulation a Conservative government would expect broadcasters to \"abide with agreed codes for socially responsible broadcasting.\"</p> <p>\"In societies such as ours people are rightly subject to plural influences, whether from family, school, media or ministers,\" he added, in a speech to the London School of Economics.</p> <p>\"Which is why public service broadcasters need to exercise responsibility with the power they hold. </p> <p>\"We have talked before of 'responsibility deals' between government and business sectors. This is a perfect example of where such a deal might operate.\"</p> <p>In his speech Hunt also said that the Conservatives' believed there was a line that would not be crossed to avoid heavy-handed state intervention.</p> <p>\"In a free society governments cannot and should not in any way direct media. I believe we can harness the power of a subsidised media sector in a way that avoids both state control and heavy-handed regulation,\" he added.</p> <p>Hunt also said that under a Conservative government media ownership laws that restrict local newspaper groups from investing in local TV in their area would be relaxed.</p> <p>He spoke out against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/24/digitalmedia.bbc\">the BBC's plans for a \u00a368m network of 65 local video news websites</a>, arguing that it would be an unnecessary extra burden on the embattled local newspaper industry.</p> <p>\"Local newspapers are a vital part of the fabric of small communities ... and are currently trying to reinvent their business model having lost much of the revenue that used to come from classified sales,\" Hunt said.</p> <p>\"As they move online why should they have to face the additional threat of subsidised competition from the BBC's plans for local video on demand? I don't think they should.\" </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>A wave of synchronized suicide attacks on UN, diplomatic and government institutions in northern Somalia killed up to 31 people today.</p> <p>Three car bombs detonated in Hargeisa, the capital of the breakaway Somaliland region. Another two vehicles exploded in neighbouring Puntland, which, like Somaliland, has been relative peaceful compared to the rest of the country.</p> <p>The careful coordination and nature of the attacks is unprecedented in Somalia and marks a serious deterioration in an already dire security situation. Suspicion immediately fell on the radical Shabaab militia, which is part of much broader Islamist-led resistance fighting against the Somali government and occupying Ethiopian troops.</p> <p>In Hargeisa, the Ethiopian consulate suffered the greatest damage, with up to 20 people reported dead. An attack on the president's palace killed at three people, including the presidential secretary, while two workers died at the headquarters of the UN Development Programme (UNPD).</p> <p>\"A vehicle forced its way into the compound and then exploded,\" said a UNPD spokesperson in Nairobi. \"It appears that the driver of the car was still inside.\"</p> <p>The suicide bombers, who were reported to have used driving four-wheel drive vehicles, struck within a few minutes of each other.</p> <p>In Bossaso, Puntland's main city, explosive-laden cars detonated at separate interior ministry offices responsible for combating terrorism, killing six people. Dozens were injured in the five attacks.</p> <p>\"I fear that this is exactly what it looks like - the Shabaab,\" said a military expert on Somalia, who cannot be named because of his position. \"We expected them to launch high-profile attacks, but this was extraordinary, requiring a large coordinated and concealed effort.\"</p> <p>Analysts believe the timing of the bombings was no accident. Regional heads of state, including Somalia's president, Abdullahi Yusuf, were meeting yesterday in Nairobi to discuss the country's future. Peace efforts had received a boost over the weekend when Yusuf's government and the opposition Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) signed a deal in Djibouti agreeing to a ceasefire, and a phased withdrawal of Ethiopian troops.</p> <p>But a breakaway wing of the ARS, as well as the Shabaab, rejected the deal. They refuse to enter negotiations before the complete withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces that invaded Somalia in December 2006 to oust an Islamist authority from power.</p> <p>Previously during peace negotiations the Shabaab has launched large attacks, mainly in Mogadishu, to demonstrate that they have control on the ground.</p> <p>\"It's clear that the Shabaab, or jihadis or whatever you want to call them, are trying to make a statement that they target any place in Somalia, not just the south,\" said a Western diplomat in Nairobi. \"But we cannot let this undermine the Djibouti agreement, and we have to expect and accept that these sort of attacks may continue in the short term.\"</p> <p>Previously there have only been one or two small suicide attacks in Somalia. Yesterday, in the Islamist-controlled port city of Kismayo, a 23-year woman accused of adultery was stoned to death in public - the first such execution in two years.</p>",
  "<p>Why is that whenever we hear about illegal drugs people are said to be \"experimenting\" with them or \"abusing\" them \u2013 never \"enjoying\" or even just \"using\" them? You'd think that all illegal drugs are devoid of any positive benefits or valid uses which is, I guess, what those who favour prohibition like to believe. But they are wrong. </p> <p>Most illegal drugs are dangerous to some extent; some very and some hardly at all. We know that our classification system does not reflect the true danger but at least analyses of danger <a href=\"http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2007/03/lancet-and-drug-harms-missing-bigger.html\">have been done</a>. Almost no one talks about the positive uses of illegal drugs, and that's why I'll be discussing this on Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/iconoclasts/\">Iconoclasts</a> this evening at 8pm. It's a live discussion show so you can email in your comments (as well as posting them here) to <a href=\"mailto:iconoclasts@bbc.co.uk\">iconoclasts@bbc.co.uk</a>. The trails seem to suggest that I'm going to get demolished.</p> <p>People use drugs for all sorts of reasons, not just because they are wicked (and should be punished) or because they are sick (and should be treated) but because they actually like using them or derive some benefit from them, whether it's for simple pleasure or delight, to ease pain, to inspire insight or creativity, or for self healing. </p> <p>I would like to live in a society that treats them with respect, encouraging their positive uses and discouraging abuse, but instead we have handed control over to criminals and ensured they are widely abused. We manage much better with other dangerous wonders. We have flying lessons, and sailing schools, pilots licences and apprenticeships. Philosopher <a href=\"http://www.philosophie.uni-mainz.de/metzinger/\"> Thomas Metzinger</a> has suggested we could have \"driving licences\" for drugs. Yet we simply push these most dangerous and wondrous of substances into the corner and hope they will go away. They will not. </p> <p>Among these are the solar-powered hang-gliders of the mind, the <a href=\"http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/\">major hallucinogens</a>, such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline \u2013 potentially dangerous if abused but wonderful if treated well. Also known as psychedelics or \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen\">entheogens</a>\" (meaning \"releasing the God within\") many of them derive from plants and have been used for millennia \u2013 but used by cultures with long experience, social controls, training for users, and very specific conditions for use. A good example is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyltryptamine\">DMT</a>, the active ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.ayahuasca.com/\">ayahuasca</a>, a complex brew of psychoactive plants used by Amazonian Indians in rituals for spiritual and mental healing. </p> <p>I first took this short-acting hallucinogen 20 years ago or so and was told by my experienced guide (yes, such guides do exist) that it would be like an eight-hour LSD trip condensed into 15 minutes. That it might be horrific, and that one of his friends had called it the worst experience he'd ever had. Hmm. That sounds fun! So why did I take it? Because then, like now, I was obsessed with understanding the mind. I wanted to learn how to face demons and terrors, how to let go of self, how to explore the further reaches of human experience. </p> <p>As the drug took hold the world disintegrated in a roaring chaos of green and orange contorting creatures. I can say little that does it justice now, except that I sat there grinning happily and saying \"terrible, terrible\". I learned much from this difficult drug, as from other easier ones. I have found peace and deep tranquillity, had visions and mystical insights, been enveloped in empathy with others, and laughed at the cosmic joke. Not everyone shares my enthusiasm for exploring weird states, and nor should they, just as not everyone wants to go hang-gliding. Yet there's something wrong with a society that blocks people's natural desire to explore their own minds.</p> <p>There are many other uses too. Before the major hallucinogens were made illegal a few therapists were using them <a href=\"http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LSD/grofhist.htm\">to great effect</a>. Sometimes a single, well-controlled dose of LSD or psilocybin could transform patients' understanding of themselves and their problems, leading to improvements rarely seen in years of expensive therapy. Many more people have simply used the drugs in their own way, but how sad that they have to take risks and go without expert guidance. I know a young woman who has been anorexic for 10 years \u2013 a horrible condition of <a href=\"http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/html/anorexia.html\">self-starvation and misery</a>. In an LSD trip by the sea on a beautiful sunny day, she went through what she called \"growing mental torture\". Yet she sat still and looked into it, until she finally found deep pleasure in being totally present \"without any fear or any desire\" and realised that her anorexic life had precluded precisely this. I can't say, and nor would she, that a single trip cured her anorexia, but it certainly contributed to her beginning to eat. This, I suggest, is use not abuse.</p> <p>Many profound drug experiences include inner meetings with death and these can, in their paradoxical way, destroy the fear of death. With so many of us facing old age, disease and dying, this possibility of inner transformation needs encouragement, not prohibition. I hope that before I die I may live in a society that has learned respect for the most powerful of mind-changing drugs. They deserve to be used, and not abused.</p>",

  "<p>It is no spoiler to reveal that the new Bond film opens with a Maurice Binder-inspired swirl of ghostly credits and diaphanous, semi-naked figures, played out to a theme tune specifically written and recorded for the occasion. It has, after all, been this way since time immemorial \u2013 or at least since the 007 title sequence was first patented with From Russia With Love.</p> <p>Here, as a curtain-raiser for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/18/jamesbond1\">Quantum of Solace</a>, are the six best Bond openings ever. You'll note these are actually my favourites as opposed to anyone else's. Please also note that the songs take precedence over the (often rather interchangeable) titles, and that there is nothing here from the last 30-odd years. I'm assuming there is someone out there prepared to champion the likes of Sheryl Crow, Garbage or Chris Cornell \u2026.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4Qx0TJ520E\">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a> (1969)</p> <p>No, it's not the best known and yes, it's shackled to George Lazenby's fumbled attempt to make the role his own. But I reckon that John Barry's sombre, elegant and gloriously stirring instrumental may just be the best Bond theme ever (as an added bonus, the film also gives us Louis Armstrong's We Have All the Time in the World). I even like the pop-art title sequence, referencing the films that went before. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pf1xAjt53E\">The Spy Who Loved Me</a> (1977)</p> <p>A friend of mine played Carly Simon's Nobody Does It Better at his wedding \u2013 an unforgivably cheesy, self-hugging decision that almost put me off this song for life. Almost, but not quite. The Spy Who Loved Me was the best of the Roger Moore Bonds and this beautifully weightless, sophisticated creation may just be 007's best song...</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3id9Ruka6GQ\">Goldfinger</a> (1964)</p> <p>... although obviously Goldfinger runs it close. Certainly it's the most famous, and arrives wedded to Binder's brilliantly burnished titles. Familiarity can't dull the titanium edge to Shirley Bassey's voice \u2013 45 years on it still cuts right through you.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_WRB17_Usw\">The Man with the Golden Gun</a> (1975)</p> <p>John Barry reportedly hated it. It has been dismissed as a tinny imitation of Goldfinger and at times the arrangement is horribly over-ornate. But Lulu's roll call of double-entendres (\"he has a powerful weapon \u2026 he comes just before the kill\") remains a grand and guilty pleasure. It also turns out to be surprisingly multi-purpose \u2013 the brassy refrain provides a shot of adrenalin to the action sequences that follow.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaqcGat1WUI\">Live and Let Die</a> (1973)</p> <p>Oooh \u2013 voodoo! Blaxploitation baddies! White guys in safari suits! All this plus a dubious reggae-themed breakdown courtesy of Paul McCartney and Wings. They don't make Bonds like this any more, which is probably for the best. But the visuals contain flames and skulls (and skulls with flames) and that's good enough for me. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZU_xftwlp4&amp;feature=related\">Diamonds are Forever</a> (1971)</p> <p>I'm torn between this one and Matt Munro's swooning From Russia With Love, but I think that Bassey just about shades it. The song has a nice, tinkling menace, while the title sequence appears to have turned a cat loose in <a href=\"http://www.hatton-garden.net/\">Hatton Garden</a>. Just look at all those rocks.</p>",
  "<p>Production responsibilities for Russell Brand's Radio 2 show moved from the BBC to the star's own company, Vanity Projects, five months ago.</p> <p>Vanity Projects' secretary is Brand's agent John Noel, according to the independent producer's listing on the Companies House website. </p> <p>Independently-produced programmes for both TV and radio are subject to the same BBC editorial guidelines as those produced in-house, including rules on swearing, fairness and the invasion of people's privacy.</p> <p>The editorial guidelines \"outline the standards the BBC expects of all BBC content on TV, radio and online\".</p> <p>The giant document, it says in its introduction, is \"designed for everyone who makes content for the BBC, to help them deal with difficult editorial decisions\".</p> <p>If ever there was a difficult editorial decision, then it was surely the one to let Brand and Jonathan Ross record a series of lewd messages on a 78-year-old actor Andrew Sachs' answerphone, and then broadcast them on a BBC Radio 2 show.</p> <p>Whether the controversial October 18 show complied with these guidelines - and who cleared the segment for broadcast if it did not - will be a key part of the BBC's investigation into the controversy.</p> <p>Programmes featuring controversial content such as swearing have to be referred upward from individual production teams for approval by a senior editorial figure, who has to sign a compliance form.</p> <p>However, the BBC has not so far confirmed the identity of the senior editorial figure who approved the October 18 Brand show for broadcast.</p> <p>Earlier this year, former Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister poured scorn on the length of compliance forms that had to be filled out by programme makers, saying they risked stifling creativity and talent.</p> <p>\"I am not arguing for anarchy but I am arguing for trust among experienced programme makers. The best people should be appointed to senior jobs and power should be devolved to them, along with responsibility,\" Bannister told the Radio Festival in July. </p> <p>Nearly 18 months after \"Crowngate\" - in which another independent production company, RDF Media, was responsible for a misleading promo shown to journalists for a BBC1 documentary series about the Queen - it may also raise questions over whether the corporation has sufficient control over content provided by outside suppliers.</p> <p>On issues of privacy, the editorial guidelines say the BBC \"will respect privacy and will not infringe it without good reason\", and will \"seek to balance the public interest in freedom of expression with the legitimate expectation of privacy by individuals\".</p> <p>Intrusions into an individual's private life can only be justified \"by demonstrating a clear public interest\", say the guidelines. </p> <p>\"Where allegations are being made, the individuals or organisations concerned should normally have the right of reply.\"</p> <p>And on the specific issue of secret recordings for comedy and entertainment programmes, the guidelines say \"people who feature prominently in the recordings must give their consent before the material is broadcast\".</p> <p>\"Secretly recorded material should not expose people to hurtful ridicule or otherwise exploit them.\"</p> <p>The guidelines are particularly explicit when it comes to the use of bad language, in particular what it calls the \"most offensive language\", including the word \"fuck\".</p> <p>\"We must make careful judgements about the use of the most offensive language post-watershed and ensure it is clearly signposted.</p> <p>\"Any proposal to use the most offensive language (cunt, motherfucker and fuck) must be referred to and approved by a senior editorial figure or for independent [radio producers] by the commissioning editor and the relevant output controller for television, radio, online and any other service.\" </p> <p>The editorial guidelines add that the BBC's chief adviser on editorial policy may also be consulted about the use of explicit language. </p> <p>Media regulator Ofcom, which is also investigating the \"Sachsgate\" broadcast, says invasions into privacy must be warranted by being shown to be \"in the public interest\".</p> <p>Ofcom adds that \"generally accepted standards must be applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of harmful and/or offensive material\".</p> <p>Brand first presented his Saturday night show on BBC Radio 2 in November 2006, after a stint on its sister digital radio station, BBC 6Music.

  "<p>Appeal court judges began hearing test cases today that could lead to the quashing of scores of murder convictions where witnesses were allowed to give evidence anonymously.</p> <p>A panel of five judges is deciding how emergency legislation on witness anonymity should apply to cases tried before the law came into effect in July this year.</p> <p>The 2008 Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act, designed to protect witnesses from intimidation, was introduced after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/25/law.justice\">landmark ruling</a> by the law lords in June that defendants had a right to face their accusers.</p> <p>The ruling in effect outlawed the practice of allowing unnamed and unseen \"screened\" witnesses to give crucial prosecution evidence.</p> <p>The following week the Crown Prosecution Service sought an adjournment in all cases using anonymous witnesses. </p> <p>Under the Act, a trial judge will still have the power to allow witnesses to keep their identity secret in the particular circumstances of the case.</p> <p>While the Act is designed to ensure that convictions cannot be quashed on appeal solely because anonymous evidence was used, it says that anonymity should not in general be granted to witnesses whose testimony is the \"sole and decisive evidence\" against the accused person.</p> <p>It is that provision which is at the centre of the appeal hearing.</p> <p>In one of the five test appeals, convicted murderer Junior Glasgow - jailed for life for shooting dead a youth worker in a confrontation over a stolen gold chain in Brixton, south London - claims he did not get a fair trial.<br>His lawyers told a court headed by the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, that the case against him was based almost entirely on the evidence of anonymous witnesses, whose testimony was \"decisive\".</p> <p>The trial judge had accepted at face value the \"protestations of fear\" expressed by the witnesses.</p> <p>Without knowing who the witnesses were, Glasgow was unable to instruct his defence team as to whether he was acquainted with a witness or whether the witness might have a motive for lying, it was argued.</p> <p>The hearing continues tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>A human rights activist swept to power today in the first democratic presidential polls in the Maldives, ousting from office the man who once imprisoned him and prompting jubilant scenes on the streets of the Indian Ocean island's capital Male.</p> <p>Mohamed 'Anni' Nasheed, a former Amnesty International prisoner of conscience who founded the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2003, secured 54 per cent of the vote \u2013 beating Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Asia's longest serving leader, in the run-off election.</p> <p>In a bitter campaign marked by personal animosity, Nasheed - a Sunni Muslim \u2013 was said to be spreading Christianity in the Islamic nation via his links with Britain's Conservative party. However his message of change coupled with a call for social and economic liberalism lifted him above the fray.</p> <p>The results mark the end of the three-decade rule of 71-year-old Maldivian strongman, Gayoom, who won the last six elections, never having before faced an opponent. Gayoom has had Nasheed thrown into jail several times over the last six years. </p> <p>Following the results, Gayoom told the nation in a live concession speech that he fully supported Nasheed:</p> <p>\"I accept the results of the ... run-off election and I respectfully congratulate Mr. Mohamed Nasheed and his party.\"</p> <p>Thousands of MDP supporters flocked to Mal\u00e9, waving yellow flags while others rejoiced at the beachfront promenade where they had camped for days in support of the opposition. Nasheed, who had emerged as a unity candidate for the five opposition parties, said he wanted a \"peaceful transition. I want my supporters to be calm.\"</p> <p>The archipelago of 300,000 people on 1,196 islands will officially get its new president on November 11, exactly 30 years after the Gayoom \"sultanate\" began. Until 2004, opposition parties were banned and it was not until violent riots broke out in August 2005, protesting Nasheed's arrest that month, that the country was set on the road to democracy.</p> <p>Autocracy did bring wealth to the string of islands. President Gayoom single-handedly built the modern Maldivian economy that rests on high-end tourism, with resorts overlooking white sand beaches and crystal clear waters where hotels charge thousands of pounds a night.</p> <p>Its per capital income of $2,200 (just under \u00a31,350) made the Maldives the wealthiest country in South Asia. </p> <p>But the figures masked huge inequalities, rampant drug abuse and corruption amid crumbling public infrastructure. \"People have seen a tiny group of people get very, very rich in the last thirty years. Meanwhile we have no communications between our islands. Our health system is in a bad way,\" said Naseem Mohamed, a spokesman for the MDP.</p> <p>\"People wanted a change from all this\". Mr Mohamed said that, although most people in the Maldives practised a relaxed form of Islam, there was an unspoken concern about the \"explosive mix of poverty and terrorism\". He said that social discord led to religious extremism, resulting in a bomb in a tourist spot last year: </p> <p>\"With our economy so dependent on tourism and the economic slowdown there is a concern the situation could turn volatile.\" </p> <p>Analysts say that the real issue for the Maldives was the period of political uncertainty before elections to the new 74-member parliament next March. The parliament has considerable powers \u2013 including the right to block presidential cabinet appointments.</p> <p>\"It is what people like Nasheed wanted\u2026 a check on presidential power. But there needs to be time to allow the politics to stabilise after Gayoom's one-man show. The opposition has everybody from the democrats to the conservative Islamic parties. It'll be hard to keep them together,\" said P Sahadevan, professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p> <h2>Profile - the victor</h2> <p>Known throughout the Maldives by his nickname, Anni, Mohamed Nasheed founded the Maldives Democratic Party in 2003 while in exile in Sri Lanka and Britain. He took his inspiration from India's Gandhi, preaching non-violence as the only route to freedom.</p> <p>He was acutely aware that his country would explode without the safety valve of democracy. Although he graduated from Liverpool with a degree in maritime engineering, Anni was best known as a fiery journalist \u2013 and quickly ran foul of the authorities. Imprisoned in the 1990s for giving an interview to the international media, Mr Nasheed spent 18 months in solitary confinement, tortured at the hands of security services. He was deprived of sleep and water, fed food with crushed glass and still has a limp from being chained to a chair outside for 12 days. He became an Amnesty Prisoner of Conscience in 1997.</p> <p>But he never lost hope in democracy. After being elected to parliament in 1999, he lost his seat in 2001 after he was prosecuted on trumped-up charges of stealing. A thorn in the side of President Gayoom, Anni has spent a total of six years either in jail or work camps. He left the Maldives in 2003 and returned in April 2005 but was arrested again the following August, sparking off civil unrest. </p> <p>By 2004, the tide was turning in the Maldives \u2013 and Anni was winning the battle of ideas. In response the government declared a state of emergency. He finally managed to register the MDP in the Maldives in June 2005.</p>",
  "<p>From TMZ, those urchin-scavengers on the twin slagheaps of celebrity and infamy, we are favoured with the full, unexpurgated script of Larry Flynt's smash-and-grab overnight political porno satire <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2008/10/08/get-a-load-of-this-whos-nailin-palin-script-1/\">Who's Nailin' Paylin?</a><br> Predictably the script's literary values are close to nil, and its political jabs, while sometimes close to the bone, are often closer to infantile, and it elicited exactly the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2008/10/20/palin_porn/index.html\">response</a> you'd expect from the blas\u00e9 know-it-alls over at Salon. They weren't impressed by three-way sex scenes between versions of Sarah Palin (porn star Lisa Ann), Hillary Clinton (feminist activist, democratic socialist and all-round very nice lady Nina Hartley) and Condi Rice, or between Todd Palin and one of Sarah's interns. Or by the ridiculous dialogue: \"Drill, baby, drill!\"; \"I'm melting the North Pole!\"; \"I'm speaking in tongues!\" et cetera.</p> <p>But to Flynt and to Hustler magazine's core audience of Joe the Plumber types, military servicemen stuck in Iraq and penitentiary inmates mired in America's correctional gulag, none of this matters. Hell, why not get a little political satire with your bump-n-grind? I bet they like this though, from the movie's Condi figure to Palin: \"You say 'you betcha' one more time and I'm gonna bitch-slap those glasses right off your face.\" Or Condi's shameful secret: \"As soon as Bush is out of office, there might be a videotape discovered of someone who looks a lot like me doing things to some guys who look a lot like Cheney, Rove, Wolfowitz and Chuck Norris.\" It's not as though American pornography is anything more than asleep-in-school blue-collar fantasy writ large and lurid - and who needs homework when you've got a hard-on?</p> <p>Flynt knows this. Even before he was shot and paralysed by a racist right-wing maniac outside a Georgia courthouse in 1978, Flynt was a political gadfly with enough money to indulge his iron whims and to make life unpleasant for his enemies and tormentors, particularly political ones. He ran for president in 1976, leaving a bright, livid stain across the year of the bicentennial, having originally built his fortune on full-frontal nude photos of Jackie Onassis. And in 1998 he came into possession of compromising information that led directly to the resignation of newly elected - and adulterous - Republican House speaker Bob Livingston before he'd even been sworn into office. Not bad for a hillbilly zillionaire with a gold-plated wheelchair and a mechanical pump in his penis to help him acheive faux-tumescence.</p> <p>And if you think there's little political content to Who's Nailin' Paylin? whatsoever, well, you may be right, but there is an indirect connection between Palin, Flynt and McCain that suggests that, deep in the background, Flynt is settling another one of his age-old scores, this time with a dead man (Flynt, who grew up in the land of the Hatfields and McCoys, never forgets a grudge.) You see, one of his earliest tormentors, back in the early 1970s when Flynt was a fledgling skin-trader in abstemious, uptight Cincinnati, Ohio, was none other than that foul blemish on McCain's own reputation, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Keating\">Charles Keating</a>. Keating was the kind of sanctimonious religious maniac who got all up in people's grills about their sexual peccadilloes, yet regarded personal wealth - particularly his own extremely ill-gotten personal wealth - as the only true index of godliness (and, of course, none of your goddamn business). He successfully dragged Flynt into court on several occasions.</p> <p>But later he was the man who essentially bribed McCain and four other prominent politicians to intervene in his favour when, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/1004633/\">infamously</a>, his Lincoln Savings and Loan was collapsing in the late 1980s, at catastrophic expense to the American taxpayer. McCain has always maintained that <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E7D9123CF932A15752C1A96F958260\">the drubbing he took over his Keating connection</a> was <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/choice2008/mccain/pow.html\">worse than his five years in Hanoi</a>. (Really, senator? Payments totalling $13,433, plus a bunch of free Caribbean family vacations, was worse than being a prisoner of war for five years? My, my, it certainly sounds arduous.) Flynt, who grew up in grinding Appalachian poverty, literally one holler over from coal miner's daughter Loretta Lynn, is not the kind of person to be impressed by a tantrum-flinging, self-dealing, third-generation rich-brat like John Sidney McCain III.</p> <p>Keating went to jail for his sins but, as the final where-are-they-now titlecard in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117318/\">The People Vs Larry Flynt</a> reminds us: \"He got off on a technicality.\" (He was played by James Cromwell, since better-known to us as Prince Philip in The Queen and George HW Bush in W, each as starchy as Keating.)</p> <p>Let me confess a personal interest in the dark doings of Flynt, who was my employer here in Los Angeles for a few years in the mid-90s. For about a year it was my privilege to write the (fictional) Hustler Letters Page (there's a real letters page, too, filled largely with the demented ravings and onanistic cris de coeur of incarcerated Americans), wherein I regaled my readers with tales of sexual braggadocio and some lowbrow comedy (\"The farmer's daughter, the cowhand and their adventures with a bovine inseminator\" was possibly my greatest hit - I'm going to hell for that one), and I made a killing reviewing porno movies for the Hustler Erotic Video Guide, alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill\">Generation Kill author Evan Wright</a> and others.</p> <p>For all its slimy reputation, Larry Flynt Publications back then was the American International Pictures of American journalism. Owned by a classic Cormanesque tightwad, it was an excellent place for talented misfits to gain experience in magazine writing (and mostly on little-read non-porno titles) before moving on to less salacious precincts like, well, the Guardian. The mastheads of America's snootiest magazines and newspapers are dotted with the names of people you'd never believe once toiled alongside pornstars and hired cocksmen, debated whether \"pre-ejaculate\" contained a hyphen or an umlaut, and bowed long and low as Flynt was wheeled through in his chair by his matching, unsmiling black-and-white bodyguards.</p> <p>I harbour no illusions about the real Larry Flynt. He was a cheapskate boss peddling a lot of shoddy product, and he barely knew the names of employees who'd worked for him for years. But the media version of Flynt - that guy I do like, the unapologetic pain in the ass, the Cadillac redneck with a pink private jet and too much cash to ever give a shit about mere politicians. Long may he rub 'em up the wrong way!</p>",
  "<p>It might have been Russell Brand's radio show where they made the now-notorious prank call, but this story is all about his co-conspirator. If Brand's chuckling sidekick had been a lesser name from the comedy circuit rather than the demi-god figure of Jonathan Ross, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/10/28/jonathan-ross-and-russell-brand-face-probe-over-manuelgate-prank-phone-calls-115875-20848966/\">Manuelgate</a> would not have made the front page of the <a href=\"http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/mailonsunday/index.html\">Mail on Sunday</a> and most certainly would not have ended up on the floor of the House of Commons.</p> <p>But it's the involvement of Ross \u2013 combined with a stack of other touchstone issues that I'll come to in a moment \u2013 that has caused this story to knock the global financial meltdown off the front pages and will engage us until the United States decides to elect or reject its first black presidential candidate.</p> <p>The reason is this. A couple of years ago, Ross signed a contract with the BBC that turned out to be worth \u00a318 million over three years. Even by showbiz standards, that's a load of lolly. When the scale of the deal was revealed, most of Soho choked on its mojitos.</p> <p>The deal prompted outrage not just among the usual suspects, but within the BBC itself. And it led to an investigation into the salaries of top stars by no lesser body than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Trust\">BBC Trust</a> \u2013 a fudge of an organisation that is supposed to regulate the corporation on behalf of the licence fee payer, but which is being out-manoeuvred at every turn by an ambitious and dynamic commercial regulatory rival, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom\">Ofcom</a>. The report failed to lay the issue to rest, and it has been rumbling on in the background ever since.</p> <p>The trouble is, Ross has become a lightening rod for the complaints of anyone who wishes the BBC were not as successful, or aggressive, or overbearing as it is. </p> <p>The corporation's commercial radio rivals detest the success of Radio 2 \u2013 which has come largely at their expense \u2013 and feel that the BBC has outbid them for talent such as Ross who should rightfully be theirs.</p> <p>Associated Newspapers, owners of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, detest the BBC because it embodies everything they hate about modern Britain \u2013 liberal, public service, populist, coarse and celebrity-obsessed (yes, that's the same Mail group that splashed pictures of Andrew Sachs' burlesque-dancer granddaughter in bra and pants all over its website).</p> <p>The Sun and the Times are happy to fall in behind the Mail titles because the BBC is a direct rival to BSkyB, in which the papers' parent company News Corporation has a controlling stake. And most newspapers are now in direct competition with the BBC, which outguns their online incarnations by running the biggest text-based news website in the world, all funded by public money, naturally.</p> <p>Gordon Brown and David Cameron, meanwhile, have intervened because it takes the heat off their respective problems in relation to the economy.</p> <p>But while Ross is the main reason why this story has gone stratospheric, it's not the only one. It embodies not just one, but a whole clutch of issues that have proved toxic for the BBC in the past. </p> <p>Manuelgate disinters the issue of audience trust that the BBC thought it had buried with the sacking last year of Peter Fincham as controller of BBC1 over the misrepresentation of the Queen. It raises the issue of the coarsening of broadcasting culture that has broadened out from the ravings of the Mary Whitehouse brigade and into a broader sociological debate. It speaks to the political debate of whether part of the BBC licence fee should be shared with other broadcasters \u2013 an issue on which Ofcom will soon give its opinion. It takes in \"national treasure\" Andrew Sachs. And to the delight of the tabloids and their website editors, the grand-daughter whose honour had been called into question by Brand and Ross turned out to be a not-so-cherubic member of the dance troupe Satanic Sluts, complete with a photographically enhanced MySpace page. </p> <p>Capping off this story's status as a parable of our times, it is revealed that Max Clifford negotiated the sale of the grand-daughter's story to the Murdoch-owned Sun, to which she complained of how her grandfather \"is really upset\" and \"wants the whole situation to end\" \u2013 ensuring, with her interview and accompanying video \u2013 that it will drag on for another few days at least. </p> <p>Today, Ross and Brand have been suspended. Brand's career is on the way up; this will do him no harm. But the Radio 2 controller Lesley Douglas \u2013 who is the subject of speculation about whether she was the \"senior editorial figure\" who approved the pre-recorded prank for broadcast \u2013 was grooming Ross to succeed Terry Wogan as presenter of the station's top-rating breakfast show. Now, with the jobs of Douglas and Ross hanging in the balance, Britain is to be denied that particular pleasure.</p> <p>Be thankful for small mercies.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was changed at 6.30pm on October 29 to make it clear that News Corporation has a controlling stake in BSkyB, but does not own it.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's BMI is being taken over by the German flag carrier Lufthansa for \u20ac400m (\u00a3318m) in the latest shake-up in the European <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/theairlineindustry\">airline industry</a>.</p> <p>Lufthansa, which already owns just under 30% of BMI, has bought the 50% owned by BMI chairman Sir Michael Bishop, taking its stake to 80%. The remaining 20% of BMI is owned by Sweden-based Scandinavian Airlines, which has said it also wants to sell.</p> <p>The deal will give Lufthansa the second largest share of takeoff and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport, behind British Airways. BMI holds 11.4% of the slots at Heathrow, second only to BA's 41.5%. </p> <p>The deal was welcomed by Sir Richard Branson's carrier, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/virginatlantic\">Virgin Atlantic</a>, which sees an opportunity to create a major rival to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">BA</a>.</p> <p>\"Michael Bishop is one of the icons of UK aviation. He has been a considerable force in championing the cause of the consumer and, along with Virgin Atlantic, has helped to provide much-needed competition to BA and choice for consumers,\" said Steve Ridgway, the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic. </p> <p>\"Now we are about to enter the next phase of BMI's future and a turning point in aviation. Everyone has speculated that it would make sense for Virgin Atlantic and BMI to combine their long-haul and short-haul networks. There is now a major opportunity to do that and create a new and even more effective competitor to BA.</p> <p>\"I am sure that Lufthansa realise the future opportunities and this could be a really good example of the right industry consolidation. It would be good for consumers, for UK plc and European aviation's competitiveness.\"</p> <p>Lufthansa is playing a major role in the consolidation of the European aviation industry. Earlier this year, it took a 45% stake in Brussels Airlines, with the option to buy the Belgian airline outright in 2011. It is also considering buying stakes in Austrian Airways and Italy's Alitalia.</p> <p>In its third-quarter results today, Lufthansa said Bishop exercised a \"put option\" for his stake of 50%, plus one share, in BMI on 10 October. The transaction is expected to be completed by January 12.</p> <p>BMI can trace its origins back to 1938 and acquired the name British Midland in 1964, later changed to BMI. Last year, the airline carried 10.6 million passengers, and it flies to 51 destinations using a fleet of 51 planes. </p> <p>Lufthansa flew 83.1 million passengers last year and operates to 209 destinations with a fleet of 276 planes. </p> <p>Dr Ashley Steel, the global chair for transport and infrastructure at KPMG, said: \"This is a much welcome next stage in the restructuring process of the European airline industry. This reinforces that airlines are no longer national in the true sense of the word or can be run on a national basis.</p> <p>\"The global economic downturn will intensify the industry crisis and the need for consolidation in the airline sector. The time has come to abolish rules that restrict foreign investors to only a limited stake in most airlines. </p> <p>\"As we have seen in the banking sector, a global economy needs international regulation and now it's time for the airline industry to abolish country-by-country rules.\"</p>",
  "<p>Big campaign donors typically come with deep pockets and influence. But in Illinois this election cycle, no one not running for office himself has given more to the nation's federal campaigns than Shi Sheng Hao, a virtual unknown in business and political circles.</p> <p>Before September 2007, Hao's name had never appeared in the 15-year-old federal database of campaign contributors. Since then, however, his donations have topped $120,000 - including $70,100 on a single June day to Republican presidential candidate John McCain.</p> <p>Over the same time frame, a network of Hao relatives has kicked in more. The take from this group over the last 13 months exceeds $269,000, most of it to McCain and the Republican National Committee, records show.</p> <p>Hao didn't register to vote at the north-west suburban address attached to his donations until October 2007, a month after he wrote his first political check, $25,000 to the RNC.</p> <p>The circumstances surrounding Hao's sudden and prolific political activism are curious and his whereabouts unclear. His name isn't listed on property records or the mailbox at the unassuming tract home listed on his donations. Hao lives \"overseas\", insisted a man who answered the door at the Roselle home recently. The man declined to identify himself.</p> <p>The story of Hao - whose varied roster of business associates appears to include a Taiwanese government investment arm as well as the mastermind of a decade-old Democratic fundraising scandal - is an eyebrow-raiser in the current election climate.</p> <p>Ethnic Chinese donors became an issue in the battle for the Democratic nomination last year because some didn't seem to live where they claimed on contribution records. Now, Republicans are raising questions about the authenticity of many small donations Democrat Barack Obama has received from abroad.</p> <p>Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, said the timing of the Hao-related contributions appeared troubling, though there could be a plausible explanation. \"Large contributions from people who have never given previously do generally provoke questions about who they are and what they're up to and most importantly, what they're looking for,\" said Krumholz, whose non-partisan group closely tracks political donations. \"The public needs to be concerned because there are fraudulent donations and persons use them to gain influence and access in Washington.\"</p> <p>McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Hao was not a \"major donor\" and \"not a part of this campaign in terms of fundraising,\" but declined to discuss him further or address the campaign's procedures for vetting donors. RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said he would not respond to questions from the Tribune, contending the newspaper was biased against McCain.</p> <p>So who is Shi Sheng Hao and what are his means and motives for becoming a mega-donor? No one answers a telephone listed in his name in the 630 area code and there's no answering machine. Messages left for him by phone and email with several relatives went unanswered.</p> <p>But this much can be gleaned from public records:</p> <p>Donation disclosures list his occupation as a businessman with entities identified only by slightly different acronyms: ADECC, AAEC, A.A.E.C.C. On some he is also listed as president of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd.</p> <p>Hao and his wife, Hsin-Ning, declared bankruptcy in 1995, at the time using the Roselle, Ill., home as an address and listing as a business a firm called Asian American Environmental Control.</p> <p>Hao holds an Illinois driver's license that lists his address as the Roselle home, but property records show the four-bedroom house has been owned since 1992 by Robert and Jen Chi and their last name is on the mailbox. Contacted at the Des Plaines marketing firm where she works, Jen Chi said she didn't want to discuss Hao, though she said she knew how to get in touch with him and would have him call the Tribune. He never did.</p> <p>\"I don't know anything about his business,\" said Chi, who herself gave $15,000 to the RNC the week after Hao's first donation. \"I don't want to be stuck in the middle.\" Hao's wife, Hsin-Ning, also used the Roselle address when she made a $25,000 contribution to the RNC last year. In September, however, she listed a Taipei address on a $2,300 contribution to the campaign fund of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>There is no record in business databases of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd, the firm listed in some Hao donation records. However, an Asian American Entertainment Corp, was incorporated early this year in California with a Shi Sheng Hao as president. Government records show that firm and at least two other Hao companies have connections to the family of Gene and Nora Lum, onetime prominent Democratic fundraisers in the Asian-American community who were convicted in 1997 of making political donations through illegal straw donors.</p> <p>A Taiwanese firm with a nearly identical name as Hao's new California company, Asian American Entertainment Ltd, is also headed by a Shi Sheng Hao. That firm has been embroiled in a lengthy legal battle in Las Vegas over a soured partnership in an application for a casino license in Macau, the former Portuguese colony now part of the People's Republic of China.</p> <p>A court filing in that case described Hao's firm as a business affiliate of the China Industrial Development Bank, a finance arm of the Taiwanese government. Hao is listed as a resident of Taiwan in corporate papers filed in the case.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the Shi Sheng Hao in the lawsuit and the California ventures is the same Shi Sheng Hao using the Roselle address. But public records point to numerous coincidences, including corporations with similar names and an overlap of investors. Some political donations from the Roselle address also refer to Hao by a nickname, Marshall, the same nickname given for Hao in the Las Vegas court action.</p> <p>Federal records indicate a pattern of large and coordinated donations from Hao, relatives and associates. Collectively, eight of them gave a total of $130,000 to the RNC in late September to early October of last year.</p> <p><strong>LOOPHOLE</strong><br>Given federal contribution limits, how can Shi Sheng Hao give $70,100 to John McCain?</p> <p>In general, individuals are barred from giving more than $2,300 to the main fundraising committee of presidential candidates in a primary race and another $2,300 in a general election.</p> <p>But the law has a loophole exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama and John McCain each control what are called joint fundraising committees that are allowed to put the arm on individual donors for tens of thousands of dollars. Between them, Obama and McCain have raised $300 million that way.</p> <p>The joint committees act as funnels, distributing money they raise to other political committees which, by law, aren't allowed to coordinate with each other on how the funds are spent. That's a feeble restriction since experienced political operatives know how to promote a candidate without comparing notes with colleagues, said Massie Ritsch, of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>",
  "<p>Picture this. The biggest run machine of our age poised to take guard against one of the fastest bowlers the world's ever known. A contest between two teams that have gone toe-to-toe for the best part of a decade, in a rivalry that has seen everything from remarkable comebacks and hat-tricks to allegations of racism and boorishness. Pencil in, too, a partisan crowd packed to the rafters, baying for blood as the visitors' premier bowler sprints in off his Mercedes-smooth run-up.</p> <p>Welcome to India against Australia, and the third Test of the series at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi. You're watching <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/sachin-tendulkar\">Sachin Tendulkar</a> front up to Brett Lee. It's the third ball after lunch, and India are struggling at 67 for two after having won a potentially decisive toss. Tendulkar had unfurled a regal cover-drive shortly before lunch when Lee returned to the attack, but the shot of the day was yet to come. Having taken out Virender Sehwag with sheer pace in the morning, Lee was running on pure adrenalin, but when he pitched one short and slightly wide of off-stump, the response was audacity itself.</p> <p>It would be tempting to call it an upper cut, because it had the same sort of deflating effect on the opponent, but it was more a clever bunt over the slips, played very late with an arched back and steely wrists. It bounced over and then disappeared over the rope. Tendulkar had played the stroke to stunning effect at Bloemfontein in 2001, and repeated it against Lee in last season's CB Series, but this was a different situation - a Test match against a team that arrived in India as undisputed rulers of the Test match castle.</p> <p>There was just one problem. The crowd roared and the Indian tricolour waved, but vast swathes of green, blue, red and orange seats were empty, shimmering brightly in the afternoon sun. If you needed a statement about Test cricket's health, you couldn't have got a more damning one. Only about 20,000 had braved the trek past the many security checks to get inside a stadium that now seats 45,000. Many might have been in bad shape after the Diwali revelries the night before, but in a city of millions you certainly expected better for a match-up that is now Test cricket's heavyweight clash.</p> <p>I watched five IPL games at the same venue earlier this year, and each time the stands were heaving, a riot of colour and noise. The Delhi Daredevils shirt could be glimpsed here and there, but there was nothing like the same fervour, except in the lower stands where they bellowed approval each time Tendulkar or Gautam Gambhir, the local boy done good, crunched a boundary. Part of the problem is Delhi itself, with its freebie culture. During the IPL, the sponsors gave away tickets like a bartender pours pints during Happy Hour, and an estimated 10,000 or more complimentary passes were given away for this game as well.</p> <p>After the disappointing crowds in Mohali, this was another harsh reality check for the purists. If crowds can no longer be found, even with so many free tickets floating around, for the biggest contest in the most taxing form of the game, then how much longer before the Twenty20 tidal wave swamps us all? Given the wretched quality of the cricket on view in Antigua so far, we can only hope that cricket never takes such a turn for the worse.</p> <p>A couple of days ago, I was at a press conference where the MCC's World Cricket Committee addressed issues of importance to the modern game. Unlike the ICC, which has become a vested-interest group that makes decisions based on political and monetary expediency, these were good men with cricket's best interests at heart, talking about everything from appalling over-rates and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/29/englandcricketteam-pakistancricketteam\" title=\"\">the disgraceful decision to overturn the Oval forfeit</a> to umpiring referrals and the possibility of using a pink ball for day-night Tests.</p> <p>If Test crowds in India this season are any guide, that last move can't come about soon enough. \"The world's moved on,\" said Steve Waugh with a shrug of the shoulder, and it's time that those that love Test cricket accept as much. Of course there are problems with day-night cricket, most of all the variance in conditions when you have bright sunshine and dry grass one session, and floodlights and dew the next. But without a crowd, you don't have a game, and lately those in Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been depressing enough to make you think of man-and-dog and pensioner-in-deckchair analogies.</p> <p>In years to come, several thousands might regret not turning up to watch India's belated Diwali celebrations. Seldom has an Australia team looked as clueless as they did after lunch, with Tendulkar, Gambhir and VVS Laxman scoring almost at will. The pint-sized <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/oct/29/india-australia-cricket-third-test\" title=\"\">Gambhir even affected a rugby-style elbow on Shane Watson</a> of the He-Man physique, and it must have been especially galling for Ponting and his men that practically every sledge was followed by a nonchalant swish to the rope.</p> <p>These are hard times for Australian cricket, exemplified by the contempt with which Cameron White was treated. Tidy in the first two games, he was taken for 27 in four overs before Ricky Ponting abandoned all hope of spin being the answer. In the days to come, Anil Kumble and Amit Mishra may just show him how it's done. If only there were more people to watch.</p>",
  "<p>With a few exceptions, like the Ask The Audience graph on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and the age-old question of whether it's acceptable to phone up a 78-year-old on Taxpayer Radio and tell him you've boffed his granddaugher, it's a largely reliable rule that the longer something exists, the more opinion of it unifies. A discourse forms and then congeals. This certainly applies to football tournaments, on two levels: firstly during the championship itself, when various opinions of its place in the pantheon zip up and down like a graphic equaliser before settling within thrusting distance of each other by the end; and then after the championship, when that loosish discourse solidifies into that dreadful thing called received wisdom.</p> <p>The only general exception to this occurs because of the mind-altering drug that is patriotism: Italia 90 and Euro 96, for example, are mostly recalled as farragoes of negativity outside England and Germany (who - and you might have forgotten this - won both tournaments). The other is USA 94, which seems to be football's ultimate Marmite tournament. In a recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/27/euro2008.euro2000?showallcomments=\" true\"\" title=\"\">Joy of Six on great tournaments</a>, descriptions of it by you bloggers included \"a belter\", \"the worst World Cup\", \"[it] rocked like a truck\", \"brilliant at the time though hindsight says it was a rather patchy affair\", \"my personal fave\", \"a nadith (sic)\", \"a cracker\", \"pure cack\", \"great\", and \"<a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI\">pr-etty good</a>\".</p> <p>In the opinion of this narrator, it deserves to be recognised as very good, which puts a decent amount of daylight between it and everything else since Mexico 86. Clearly it was not perfect, and those who disparage it will cite at least two, possibly all seven, of the following pieces of information: the soul-crushing final; the predictable semi-finals; the absence of British teams; a victorious side who were Brazilian only in name; the death of Andres Escobar; the fact that it was in America; and Matt Lorenzo fronting ITV's coverage.</p> <p>We'll come to those later - although the last one is the fairest cop - but there were so many positive things about USA that not even Satan's PR people would bother arguing against them. The most important, as ever, were goals. The tournament was the first after the backpass law was introduced in 1992, and so came between the ultra-defensive Italia 90 and a time when defences had fully worked out how to get round the new rule. Consequently, it was as ingenuous as modern football could ever be. The final was terrible, but it wasn't for the want of trying: only Norway were a genuinely negative presence, and most of the teams had a real go. The average of 2.712 net-ticklers per game is the second-highest since Mexico 70 (behind Spain 1982), and the total of 44 goals in 15 knockout games (excluding the third-place play-off, which has an end-of-term autonomy that renders it irrelevant for this purpose) is the highest since the round of 16 was introduced in 1986.</p> <p>Exactly a quarter of those goals came from a quartet of attackers whose impish menace illuminated the tournament: none of Roberto Baggio, Romario, Hristo Stoichkov and Gheorghe Hagi are taller than 5ft 9ins, and the latter three in particular gleefully tormented the bigger boys with the mischief and coiled aggression of urchin pickpockets.</p> <p>Romario and Baggio could not redeem <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw9TJFmlbJU&amp;feature=related\">a final</a> that passed into infamy even before it ended sadly in a penalty competition. There's no doubt it stunk, and the fact that it was the first to be a) goalless and b) decided on penalties means that, even if it went door to door like Jesus Quintana, it would not be forgiven in polite society. But did it stink quite as much as we remember?</p> <p>Actually yes, yes it did, but there were still moments of the highest drama. Gianluca Pagliuca had the \"luck of the devil\" when he bar-of-soaped Mauro Silva's feeble long-ranger on to a post. Romario and Bebeto both missed open goals. Viola went on that coronary/orgasm-inducing solo run in extra-time. Baggio, who was on his last legs at the start of the game never mind the end, missed a great late chance to make this every bit as much his World Cup as it was Diego Maradona's in 1986. Overall it was certainly not as bad as the 1990 final: it was much less cynical, and at least you didn't know who'd win this one. There was also a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=boPQNpPvJq0\">truly legendary display</a> of unyielding defensive excellence from a palpably unfit Franco Baresi, 34, <em>who had undergone a knee operation less than a month earlier</em>. The stones on that one!</p> <p>It was also, lest we forget, one of only three 0-0 draws in the tournament (you should remember the others, because they went past forgettable and round to hideously memorable: Bolivia v South Korea and Ireland v Norway). The fact that the victors were perceived as being Brazilian only in name is also used in evidence against the tournament. In his World Cup history, Brian Glanville describes them as \"a dull, functional [team] which relied heavily on the inventive brilliance of Romario and Bebeto up front, scarcely served by a pedestrian midfield.\" This team certainly wasn't fit to play keepy-uppy with the same table-tennis ball as the vintages of 1970 and 1982, yet the suspicion remains that, like the Coen Brothers with Burn After Reading and Intolerable Cruelty, they are being judged only by the stratospheric standards they have previously set. Their midfield may have been mostly water-carriers, but they did not tread water in possession: Brazil still played some high-class one-touch stuff. And they had Romario. Workmanlike/efficient from top to toe except for one minuscule but incredibly important piece as the focal point: were they really much different from Argentina in 1986?</p> <p>The hero of that tournament, Maradona, was one of the villains of this. And while guardian.co.uk does not condone, etc, etc, there's no question that, in a world obsessed with the salacious, his drug-test failure added a huge layer of melodrama to the tournament: aptly, Argentina had relocated to Dallas by the time the news broke.</p> <p>So, alas, did the shocking death of Andres Escobar. He was part of a Colombia team which, at the start of the tournament, were hailed as potential winners by Pele among others. Though they flopped fatally, the pre-tournament hype was one of the joys of this tournament: we knew very little about the Colombians, save for Carlos Valderrama, Faustino Asprilla and the mythical 5-0 win away to Argentina. This was the last World Cup that represented a thrilling step into the unknown: there were few foreign players in the Premiership, no live coverage of European leagues apart from Serie A, and no internet. The <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=fgI3fxuSrRM\">Nigerians</a> in particular were revelatory.</p> <p>The absence of British sides accentuated the sense of this being a voyage of discovery. It is very much a personal issue: while some prefer tournaments that aren't polluted with Englishness, for the majority the absence of Carlton Palmer, Andy Sinton and David Batty ruined USA 94 before it started. Certainly the location of the tournament did. In the years leading up to the tournament, every Punt, Dennis and Harry spoofed Soccerball and the like - and hilariously too, oh aye - which created an almost self-fulfilling prophecy of presumed excess. That seemed to be confirmed by Diana Ross's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=WXjCKwBtG0I\">penalty-kick farce</a> before the first game but, apart from that, it was largely handled very well. And accusations of apathy don't really stand up to the fact that this was the highest-attended World Cup of all, both in total and average crowds.</p> <p>Some suggest that those crowds witnessed very few great games or great goals, but this is highly debatable. Romania v Argentina was a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUhJkZQorI&amp;feature=related\">bona fide classic</a>, the best World Cup game since France v Brazil in 1986. All four quarter-finals were subject to riveting late stings, which more than compensated for the relatively predictable semi-finals. Then there were Argentina v Nigeria, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=mFFXdDAKnU8\">Nigeria v Italy</a>, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gVR4gB97TQ8&amp;feature=related\">Colombia v Romania</a>, Spain v South Korea, and Germany v South Korea. There were more genuinely great games at France 98, but they, like that <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ftqU2watI&amp;feature=related\">astonishing scene in Intacto</a>, stood out partly because the rest of the story was so so-so. At USA 94, the balance of the great, the good and those involving Norway reflected a strong narrative perfectly.</p> <p>So did the goals. In truth the two most celebrated goals of the championship are overrated: <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OZX6LXL9Pjc\">Saeed Al-Owairan's against Belgium</a> (look how heavy his third-last touch is. Sorry, but how can you take that seriously?); and Hagi, who benefited from the slack his own greatness had earned when what was almost certainly a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bx2arEYJbTI\">misplaced cross</a> against Colombia was perceived to be deliberate (nobody said the same of Ion Andoni Goikoetxea's goal against Germany, did they?). But those aside the tournament was awash with some <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=otPypMC_kzA\">enormously classy goals</a>. Personal favourites are <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZjYQPpP8M\">all of Baggio's</a>, each taken with Zen-like calm and scary precision (all five hit the side-netting), Tomas Brolin's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pzV4KNj51Do\">high-IQ free-kick</a> against Romania, the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ak2DfCwuMkQ\">sublime-touch-for-a-big-man lob by Kennet Andersson</a> against Brazil, and the two that Hagi and Ilie Dumitrescu made for each other on the counter <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=OnNliThxA7c\">against Argentina</a>, each dependent on a deliciously judged pause while they waited for the appropriate pass to present itself.</p> <p>Then there were the little details, the one-liners that embellish the plot. In what may turn out to be the longest paragraph ever, we'll attempt to list them. The late kick-off times in England, nirvana for the freaks, geeks and insomniacs; Barry Davies doing his only World Cup final; Martin Dahlin and Andersson proving that direct football could be both thrilling <em>and</em> classy (Sweden were the tournament's top scorers with 15); the haircuts, from <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zrjrYgGOlyY\">Yordan Letchkov</a> legitimising baldness to Alain Sutter's <a href=\"http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/72528025.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF193875DCB1DD8387ABBDAD19435506456FEA40A659CEC4C8CB6\">uber-Fabio mane</a>, Tony Meola's <a href=\"http://cache.gettyimages.com/xc/1790682.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=17A4AD9FDB9CF1939057D9939C83F106EB9D991E069F59655A5397277B4DC33E\">Shep-from-Fargo greaseback</a>, the Happy Days side-parting of Mexico's Zague, Alexi Lalas's - well what exactly <em>was</em> that? - and, of course, future Reading keeper's Borislav Mikhailov's syrup; Romania, the World Cup's best loose cannons since <em>ever</em> (and to think it could have been Wales); the Americans' <a href=\"http://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/International-Teams-North-America/c23_80/p1585/1994-USA-Home-Shirt-L/product_info.html\" title=\"\">cool but hangover-baiting home kit</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk/International-Teams-North-America/c23_80/p13280/1994-USA-Away-Shirt-L/product_info.html?osCsid=\" lqva421pqt40ev7a7g4mqoqn45\"\" title=\"\">hideous away kit</a>; <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FgfM2QBFWL8\">Rashidi Yekini's throatlump-inducing celebration</a> after scoring Nigeria's first World Cup goal; a dead rubber given significant life by the record-breaking of Roger Milla, the oldest World Cup goalscorer, and Oleg Salenko, the first man to score five goals in one World Cup game; the story of Italy, who went closer to the precipice than James Bond in almost every game but kept surviving; Clive Tyldesley's absurdly extravagant pronunciation of 'Dooooooomidrescu'; Romario slithering magisterially through a non-existent space between two defenders only to eventually have his shot cleared off the line in the semi-final against Sweden; the bravest decision in managerial history, by Arrigo Sacchi, when he took Roberto Baggio off after Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off against Norway; the magnificent certainty of Dunga's spot-kick, the eighth and penultimate in the final, which put Brazil in the lead for the first time and was the first example of the 'captain's penalty'; the glorious meltdown of John Aldridge and Jack Charlton; the brutality and Hitchcockian suddenness of Leonardo's elbow on the USA's Tab Ramos, an incident that has become more unfathomable as we have got to know him subsequently; Greece being so inept that they allowed Argentina to have a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=oN_q2Smb208\">four-on-one attack</a> <em>in the second minute of their first-ever World Cup game</em>; Viola's 14 minutes of fame; a group of death so tight that Mexico, Italy, Ireland and Norway finished on the same points and with the same goal difference; the forgotten contribution of Daniele Massaro, the only non-Baggio to score for Italy in the tournament and the other man besides Baresi and Baggio to miss in the final shoot-out; and a performance of such comic ineptitude from the referee Jamal Al Sharif in the <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=CFp2rN4vsf4\">Mexico v Bulgaria match</a> that even Trevor Brooking eased himself away from the splinters of the fence to call it: \"(An) absolute scandal ...

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Alexander Kaines (vocals, guitar), Johnny Lloyd (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Cratchley (bass), Dan White (keyboards), Ben Niblett (drums).</p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Alexander Kaines (vocals, guitar), Johnny Lloyd (vocals, guitar), Jimmy Cratchley (bass), Dan White (keyboards), Ben Niblett (drums). </p> <p>The background: There are a few new British bands waiting in the wings to assume the mantle of Radiohead circa The Bends as the OK-to-like epic rock balladeers with the vocally acrobatic frontman: White Lies, Red Light Company, Wild Beasts, The Rushes ... and now Operahouse. They're well named. Johnny Lloyd might not exactly cause Placido Domingo (or even Bono or Thom Yorke) sleepless nights, but he can hold a note and he favours the soaring, sweeping chorus - all the better for him to show what he can do, which is sweep and soar. He's emotive (as opposed to emotional) and although the music he writes with Alex Kaines may not trouble the proprietors of the Royal Opera House, it's a notch or two above the usual three-chord indie shambles slung together by boys who consider the collective works of Arctic Monkeys and the Libertines the height of musical ambition. <br> Actually, they do have a bit of a past as Doherty/Turner worshippers, although unlike White Lies, they haven't undergone a full-scale transformation and name change. What they have done is sharpen up their act and push themselves that little bit harder. The band are keen to let us know that they've been listening to a lot of Pixies and Beatles, Led Zeppelin and Velvet Underground, but it doesn't show.</p> <p>Change in Nature, the title track of their forthcoming EP (and a song about climate change and the first monkey in space - it says here), suggests they've been paying closer attention to the Verve, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, and all those acts they'd rather we didn't mention, such as Keane, Coldplay and Snow Patrol - if only to check out the competition and attempt to supersede them.</p> <p>More than anyone, they remind us of early Starsailor, ie when they were serious contenders (\"serious\" being the operative word). Credit where it's due, though: the drums towards the end of Change in Nature have the heft and wallop of John Bonham and Plastic Cage has Zep-style climactic dynamics, making the whole song feel like one long crescendo - except for the middle bit with its atmospheric (read: boring) echoes of U2 circa The Joshua Tree. Meanwhile Red Hats for the Masses does the slow/fast, quiet/loud Pixies thing quite convincingly.<br> The odds are stacked in their favour. They're on a label run by the bloke who signed the Killers. Their producer is Richard McNamara of Leeds' anthemic miserablists Embrace, a band who know a thing or two about slogging through when the tide of musical fashion goes against you. They've got Dave Bascombe (Depeche Mode, Tears For Fears) in to mix their album - there are traces of 80s pop bombast here, not necessarily a bad thing. And they have a healthy disregard for accusations of overambition, even preposterousness, as their lyric to Change In Nature attests: </p> <blockquote> <p>An Indian chief in World War 3, left alive in sympathy<br>The curled up mother of the destined twins<br>To grow up weak on food from tins<br>Generation TV shy, when asked the colour of the sky<br>Said grey, white, black, oh my oh my</p> </blockquote> <p> Oh my indeed. More than anything, they don't want to be the Wombats or the Enemy. \"We try and sculpt songs and make them more like a piece of modern music,\" they say. \"If you don't have dreams and ambition, what's the point of doing this?\"<br> <br><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Operahouse have built a sound that towers over their young Britrock peers just like Babel would've done over Eiffel.\"<br> <br><strong>The truth:</strong> If you thought The Verve's comeback album was a bit of a letdown you might like this downbeat take on their pseudo-sombre pomp-rock, designed as it is for late-night summer festival slots. <br> <br><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Start a reassessment of Starsailor. <br> <br><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Stop climate change.<br> <br><strong>What to buy:</strong> The Change in Nature EP is released on November 10 by Marrakesh. <br> <br><strong>File next to:</strong> Geneva, The Verve, Wild Beasts, Starsailor. <br> <br><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/operahousehq\">MySpace.com/operahousehq</a>; <br><a href=\"http://www.operahousehq.com\">operahousehq.com</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Empire Of The Sun.</p>",
  "<p>An interesting <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/25/theater/25women.html?ref=theater\">piece</a> in Saturday's New York Times: women playwrights in the city have organised a meeting to discuss their under-representation in theatres in the city. Of the 50 plays by living American playwrights at Off-Broadway theatres at the moment, 40 are by men and 10 by women.</p> <p>Which set me to thinking, when was the last time I saw a play by a woman? It was back in the summer: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/05/edinburghfestival.theatre3\">Zinnie Harris' Fall</a>, at the Traverse at Edinburgh this August. Who are the living British women playwrights who are household names, or even vaguely approaching the status of household names in chattering-class homes? Caryl Churchill. Moira Buffini maybe. We'll perhaps give Sarah Kane a let, because she died too young. But there's no one even vaguely on the name-check level of David Hare, Alan Bennett, Michael Frayn \u2013 or the younger folk, Mark Ravenhill and Kwame Kweh-Armah and dozens of others you could mention. Astonishingly, the first original play by a woman to be performed on the stage of the Olivier at the National Theatre was this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/02/theatre1\">Her Naked Skin</a> by Rebecca Lenkiewicz. </p> <p>I asked four subsidised London theatres to tot up for me the plays by men as opposed to the plays by women for the past two years. I didn't ask them to differentiate between living and dead playwrights, which admittedly skews the figures a great deal, except in the case of the Royal Court, which of course is a new-writing theatre. Anyway, by financial year:</p> <p>National Theatre<br>2007-8: 19 by men, four by women<br>2008-9: 16 by men, four by women (not including in-i, not strictly a play, co-created by Akram Khan and Juliette Binoche).</p> <p>Donmar Warehouse<br>2007-8: six by men, 0 by women<br>2008-9: four by men, two by women</p> <p>Almeida<br>2007-8: four by men, three by women<br>2008-9: six by men</p> <p>Royal Court:<br>2007-8: nine by men, seven by women<br>April-Dec 2008: (programme to April 09 not yet annouced): 11 by men, three by women, not including Caryl Churchill anniversary readings. (I am also told that three new plays by women will be performed in the new year.)</p> <p>There are of course all kinds of historical reasons for this disparity. But it's pretty stark, and it doesn't seem to be ironing itself out fast. Depressing. Women novelists are everywhere; writing by women is on the whole booming. But women dramatists simply don't get the same kind of exposure.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>So, if you believe the rumours, new Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp will return to Portsmouth to purchase (in order of likelihood):</strong> Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch, Lassana Diarra, that tasty souped-up Ford Granada occasionally parked at the top of Frogmore Road on match days, cos it's in pretty good nick, innit, John 'Bell-Ringing Name-Changing Eejit' Westwood, David James.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>But in the meantime, with just over two months to wait before he can go on his manic spree with Daniel Levy's hard-won Berbatov-and-Keane booty, Harry will have to make do with what he's got.</strong> Which is not so bad: after Sunday's match against Bolton, he's suddenly got, in Roman Pavlyuchenko, a one-Premier-League-goal-in-a-row striker who might finally have the confidence to put himself about a bit. And with Arsenal not defending particularly well so far this season, lacking a few inches at the back, yet attacking as beautifully as ever, this could make for a fantastic game of football.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Or maybe it won't. Either way, we'll find out when play gets going at:</strong> 8pm.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Misidentified Motah dept.</strong> \"If I'm not mistaken, guvnor,\" writes Julian Smith, \"that's a picture of a Ford Cortina, not a Granada. Of course, they're similar but with the Cortina being the smaller motor, Appy Arry's been taken for a ride he wasn't expecting.\" How can you tell? They all look much the same to me. Still, Redknapp needn't worry too much. \"At least the visible portion is in good nick, I'll give you that,\" chimes in Andrew Howse. \"Course, the back end could be on a trolley jack, or half a dozen breeze blocks, for all I can see.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The Arsenal:</strong> Almunia, Sagna, Silvestre, Gallas, Clichy, Walcott, Fabregas, Denilson, Nasri, Van Persie, Adebayor.<br>Subs: Fabianski, Diaby, Toure, Vela, Song Billong, Bendtner, Eboue.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Yer Actual Tottenham:</strong> Gomes, Hutton, Corluka, Woodgate, Assou-Ekotto, Bentley, Modric, Jenas, Huddlestone, Bale, Pavlyuchenko.<br>Subs: Cesar, Zokora, Lennon, Bent, Gunter, Campbell, O'Hara.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>\"The only way Tottenham can get back to the glory days of years ago is with Harry Redknapp as manager.\"</strong> So says Sky pundit Jamie Redkna... oh I can't be bothered finishing that. Has there ever been a more shameless piece of broadcasting? Eh, hold on, no, Richard Keys has just trumped him. \"Nine top-flight matches in midweek, have you ever seen anything like it?\" Well, how about the days before your paymasters started buggering about with the fixture lists left, right and centre? How about then?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Pre-match analysis of Redknapp's post-match analysis:</strong> \"Anyone got the odds on a Spurs defeat being explained away by Harry's motivational mantra of 'Look what I've got to work with'?\" wonders Tom Prankerd. \"It's guaranteed to get the red tops to let him off, while simultaneously totally undermining players' confidence.\" That's got to be odds on, Tom, as it's the exact same gambit which went down so well at Portsmouth. While he was manager of Southampton.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Arsenal set the ball rolling. Spurs shin clearances out of play twice. Then there's a bout of head tennis, followed by some hacking and an air shot. The only way is up.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3 mins:</strong> It's very, very cold in north London. I can tell you that for nothing, having just gone outside for a cigarette. We're now nearly three minutes in and nobody's strung more than two passes together.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 mins and a couple of milliseconds:</strong> Spurs hit the post! Huddlestone dinks a delicious ball over the top of Sagna, who is on the back foot. Bale scoots free into the left-hand side of the box, but the angle is very tight. Nevertheless, he gets a shot in, hitting the base of the post, the ball clinking off into the side netting. Almunia was kidding on he had that covered, but I'm not so sure.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Pass, miscontrol, pass, miscontrol, balloon, shank, slice, pass, pass, miscontrol, balloon, shank, miscontrol, balloon, shank, miscontrol, balloon, shank, throw in.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> But if any team is managing to exert some sort of control over the ball, it's Spurs. Hutton, Huddlestone, Modric and Bentley have all shown a desire to drive forward and pick out Pavlychenko with a quick pass; it's just that none of them have managed to do it successfully yet. Arsenal meanwhile are a bit all over the shop. Early days, though.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Nasri bursts down the left but the minute he cuts inside he's bustled off the ball by Hutton and Corluka. This is a solid start by Spurs, who are snapping into every tackle.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Sanga pings a cross in from the right which Adebayor knocks immediately back to Walcott. From the right-hand corner of the box, Walcott fires a low shot just wide of the bottom-left corner. A decent effort, that.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13 min: AN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC GOAL BY FORMER ARSENAL MAN DAVID BENTLEY. THIS IS GOAL OF THE SEASON, RIGHT HERE. Arsenal 0-1 Tottenham.</strong> This is outstanding. The ball bounces around the centre of the Arsenal half for a few seconds. Then Jenas knocks it to Bentley, who volleys the ball a few centimeters into the air, then volleys it again, 40 yards this time, sending a looping shot screaming over the stranded Almunia - who couldn't have been expected to expect that. That's Matthew Le Tissier multiplied by Xabi Alonso, squared, on the end of a stick.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Van Persie slaps in a decent free kick from 25 yards. Low, hard and swerving, Gomes does well to turn it round the left-hand post. The corner is wasted. That goal, though... dear me.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Van Persie is Arsenal's most potent attacking force at the moment. Now he's tearing down the left after a long ball, forcing Corluka to head out for a corner. There is about a minute of fannying around left and right from the corner, but eventually the ball finds its way to Van Persie again, on the edge of the area. He's got time, but manages to take too much, and his shot is barged down. Everything seems to be revolving round the Dutch striker at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> From yet another Arsenal corner, the ball breaks to Gallas, to the right of goal, just inside the box. His first-time shot is a rising screamer... but it's rising too high. \"Bentley's goal: was it 'screaming' or 'looping'?\" enquires Jeff Cumpson. \"I'm only trying to understand.\" It was screaming <em>and</em> looping, Jeff. Screaming <em>and</em> looping.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Arsenal have currently lost their way, with passes no longer sticking. Harry Redknapp looks very content with his first 25 minutes work as Spurs boss. (Nobody's really counting the Bolton game, are they?)</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Walcott and Nasri exchange passes on the edge of the Spurs area, but Nasri is far too ponderous when the chance of a shot presents itself, and the move is broken up. Arsene Wenger, in comparison to his opposite number, has taken to waving his arms around in the semaphore fashion.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Another Arsenal corner, another accomplished Tottenham clearance. This is getting old.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Walcott shifts the ball between his feet just insider the Spurs area on the right. It's nifty skill, but he can't quite get the backlift and the shot is easily snaffled by Gomes.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Walcott has another shot from almost exactly the same position on the pitch, but this one is blocked before it can reach the keeper. The ball finally ends up with Clichy, who has a pretty decent dig from just outside the area, the effort not too far over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Walcott, who is very lively, sashays through the centre, but his lay-off finds Van Persie surrounded. The danger is quickly snuffed out. \"You are absolutely right,\" begins Gareth Holden's email, the sort I love to read. \"The ball was screaming and looping. I think it might also have been veering, dipping and rocketing as well.\" And wheeching. We forgot wheeching.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>37 min: GOAL!!! Arsenal 1-1 Tottenham.</strong> Fabregas cuts inside from the left and sends a lovely curling shot towards the bottom-right corner. Gomes fingertips round the post brilliantly. How he will wish he had not bothered: from the resulting corner, the keeper comes out to weakly flap at Van Persie's delivery, allowing Silvestre to ping a header into the left-hand side of the net.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Both teams are looking to push forward - Bentley has just had a couple of sorties down the right - and the game is flying along at a fair old lick.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Tottenham string about 20 passes together, getting about 20 yards from Arsenal's goal before turning around and going all the way back to their keeper. They'll be glad for the rest, because Arsenal have had the lion's share of possession during this half.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Arsenal 1-1 Tottenham.</strong> That Bentley goal was utterly ridiculous.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong><a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=r4txonbZb4w\">Bentley has form.</a></strong> \"It's not the first time he's done this,\" says David Hindle. \"I wish he still played for us.\" It was also a little bit like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_y9sab0JOQ\">this</a> - scored <em>against</em> Blackburn. And so the cycle is complete.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>And we're off again! And within 45 seconds it's a GOAL!!! Arsenal 2-1 Tottenham.</strong> Arsenal immediately make some determined progress down the right, whereupon Van Persie is needlessly dragged down by Huddlestone. Van Persie swings a free kick towards the penalty spot, for Gallas to head towards the bottom corner and home. That's a great header - but the flaky Gomes should have got a hand to that. David James will want to keep his mobile switched on tonight. That it's come to this for Tottenham.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Tottenham look shellshocked, and no wonder. What a dreadful start to their half. Perhaps as a direct result, Dave Weiss has lost it: \"Gomes is awful, just awful. I've heard him described as eccentric - who wants an eccentric goalie? I want a goalie who knows where he's supposed to be, knows where the balls is and keeps it from going in the back of the net.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Denilson takes a pop from 25 yards. It's heading towards the bottom-right corner, but this time Gomes does his job and pushes the ball round the post. And from the corner, Silvestre should have scored to make it 3-1: he loses Hutton with embarrassing ease and is clear eight yards out, right in the centre, when he heads wide left. Spurs appear to have fallen into very small pieces.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Assou-Ekotto is booked for shoving over Walcott. Lennon comes on for Bale. \"Why did you nix my link?\" sobs Blackburn fan and half-time YouTube contributor David Hindle, betrayed, tears running from his wide eyes. Yet how soon innocent despair turns to bilious anger. \"Rub salt in the wounds why don't you! And all I'm trying to do is give you useful material for half time. Did I deserve that Le Tissier goal? Really?\" I feel terrible now. All I ever do is try to spread the love.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Now Bentley is booked for a clumsy lunge on Clichy. Fabregas swings the resulting free kick into the area, and Gomes makes a right old song and dance about claiming the ball.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> And another booking! Huddlestone is yellow-carded for being a bit of a big lumbering bugger, the far more mobile Clichy running straight into him when attempting to scuttle past. Tottenham are quickly unravelling here.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Clichy makes a superb break down the inside-left channel. His pullback to Fabregas is, however, poor and easily cleared. No matter: Spurs conspire to clank the ball straight back into their own area, where it falls at the feet of Adebayor. He really should have put this game to bed, ten yards out and unmarked as he was, but he manages to drag his low shot wide left of goal. Lucky, lucky Tottenham.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min: GOAL!!! THIS IS OVER!!! Arsenal 3-1 Tottenham.</strong> From the centre circle, Van Persie sends a beautiful ball straight down the centre of the pitch, ripping the Spurs back line to sorry little pieces and sending Nasri free. He dinks the ball over the advancing Gomes, though not with enough pace: it requires Adebayor to poke the ball home before Hutton can get to it and hook clear.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Tottenham respond by replacing the hopelessly ineffectual Pavlychenko with Bent.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>67 min: GOAL!!! THIS IS NOT OVER!!! Arsenal 3-2 Tottenham.</strong> Huddlestone has a speculative shot from 25 yards out. It's low and hard, and Almunia can't hold on this time: the ball spills out into the empty area, allowing Bent to race in and slap a brilliant shot into the bottom right corner.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min: GOAL!!! ACTUALLY WE HAD IT RIGHT FIRST TIME!!! Arsenal 4-2 Tottenham.</strong> Hutton inexplicably gives the ball away to Adebayor, who cuts inside from the left, jogs across the front of the area and slips a ball out right to Van Persie, who wastes no time in roofing an unstoppable shot past Gomes. There were 84 seconds between those two goals. This is some game.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> This was so close to 4-3, as Bentley swipes a free kick in from the left wing towards Jenas, who is four yards out and millimeters from getting his toe to the ball and guiding it past Almunia. As it is, the ball sails through and the keeper claims.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> And this should have been 5-2. Down the left, Nasri skates past Hutton like he's not there and whips in a delightful cross. Van Persie, flying in, should poke home from six yards, but misses the ball. This is one of the most open games I've watched in a long time. Superb entertainment.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Nasri and Van Persie exchange a couple of passes as they shuttle the ball from right to left, the latter finally attempting to chip Gomes almost from the byline. Walcott has gone off, by the way, replaced a couple of minutes back there by Eboue.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Hutton, who has had a pretty poor match, is replaced by Gunter.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Adebayor misses wide right with a header from six yards, his excuse being Corluka should have cleared it easily just ahead of him, but completely missed the ball. Van Persie goes off to a great ovation, to be replaced by Diaby.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Jenas is booked for his 845th minor offence of the evening, this one on Denilson.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Bentley tries to score again from 30-plus yards. This attempt is utterly awful.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Song comes on for Nasri.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>89 min: WHAT A HOPELESS MISTAKE BY CLICHY. Arsenal 4-3 Tottenham.</strong> Clichy has at least ten seconds to decide what to do, just by the halfway line out on the left. With three options, he takes none of them, before falling over on the ball. Jenas races off with the gift, cuts inside and, just as he reaches the edge of the area, curls a wonderful effort into the top left corner. This is, not for the first time, once again on!</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There are going to be four added minutes, the announcement of which was met by the sound of 60,000 mouthfuls of teeth being sucked.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min +3: THIS IS AN UTTERLY OUTSTANDING MATCH! Arsenal 4-4 Tottenham.</strong> Modric takes a wonderful smack from the edge of the area. It loops, dips, beats Almunia and hits the left-hand post. It comes back out to Lennon, who prods home. Unbelieveable!</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Arsenal 4-4 Tottenham.</strong> Bloody hell.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Bloody Hell II:</strong> Bloody hell.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Well that was an absolute belter of a match.</strong> Arsenal should have wrapped that up long before the end, though whether teams really require three-goal leads with less than a minute to go is a moot point. Gael Clichy will have nightmares about his headspin, but what a response by Tottenham: for all that Arsenal capitulated - and it was a pathetic capitulation - Jenas's goal was a gem, and Modric's shot against the post deserved to secure the draw. And that's without mentioning Bentley's wonder strike. Bloody hell, that was <em>fantastic</em>. I'll leave the last word to David Bendelman: \"Bloody hell.\"</p>",

It was centred 35 miles from the provincial capital, Quetta, and had a preliminary magnitude of 6.4, the US Geological Survey <a href=\"http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/shake/ous/STORE/X2008yscs/ciim_display.html\">reported</a>. </p> <p>Pakistan's meteorological department said there were two tremors, the second bigger than the first.</p> <p>A string of around 18 aftershocks followed, and the second quake had a magnitude of 6.2.</p> <p>The worst-hit area was Ziarat, where around 2,000 mostly mud and timber houses in five villages were destroyed.</p> <p>The local mayor, Dilawar Khan Kakar, said hundreds of people were injured and 15,000 left homeless. Some homes were buried in a landslide triggered by the quake.</p> <p>Rescuers had pulled 160 bodies from the rubble in the Ziarat valley area, one of Baluchistan's most popular tourist spots, he told Reuters.</p> <p>\"There is great destruction.

  "<p>The escalating crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region of <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17886\">North Kivu</a> is chillingly reminiscent of the war that first erupted there 10 years ago. </p> <p>Between 1998 and 2002, we witnessed one of the worst conflicts ever recorded. Armed groups in search of political power and economic control over Congo's immense natural resources and backed by the Congolese, Rwandan and Ugandan governments, manipulated tensions and land disputes between ethnic groups to the point where a brutal and bloody war became inevitable. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in some of the most horrific ways \u2013 many were hacked to death with machetes and hand-axes. Tens of thousands fled their homes in a desperate bid to survive. </p> <p>Despite various peace agreements signed between 2002 and 2008, eastern Congo has been plagued by ongoing instability and simmering ethnic and political tensions. </p> <p>Fast-forward 10 years, and once again a dreadful and brutal conflict is looming across the horizon of the verdant mountainous region of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/29/congo-unitednations\">North Kivu</a>. </p> <p>In recent months, armed violence has broken out between rebel armed groups \u2013 primarily, but not exclusively, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/28/congo-fighting-nkunda\">Rwandese General Laurent Nkunda</a>'s forces (FDLR) \u2013 and government armed forces. </p> <p>And once again, it has resulted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/28/congo-unitednations?picture=339065168\">hundreds of thousands of civilians</a> being caught in the crossfire. </p> <p>Just last month <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17886\">Amnesty reported</a> how thousands of children are being forced to take up weapons and fight; while women and girls \u2013 some as young as six \u2013 have been raped or exposed to other forms of sexual abuse. </p> <p>The people there are struggling to survive in an environment already fractured and brutalised by previous wars \u2013 can they really withstand the abuses from another war? Or perhaps the question should be \u2013 should they have to? </p> <p>Now more than ever the international community has to deliver concrete measures to protect these people from further human rights abuses. International pressure must be applied to all parties of the conflict to stop all attacks on the general population. </p> <p>The UN Security Council has to make eastern Congo their top priority as they meet over the coming weeks and months. </p> <p>And in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN's peacekeeping force already stationed in the country \u2013 Monuc \u2013 must be given the adequate resources and equipment needed to ensure that they are able to effectively protect civilians, and to disrupt any armed group attacks against local communities. There should also be a clear plan of evacuation in place for the people living in dangerous zones. </p> <p>Millions of Congolese people have already endured a decade of insecurity, unrest and displacement. The prospect for the next 10 years simply should not be the same as the last.</p>",
  "<p>For a long time, the globetrotters' chatter would have had you believe that beyond the breathtaking Atomic Peace memorial gardens and museum, Hiroshima was a place that had little going for it.</p> <p>Cursed as a static monument to the nuclear destruction wrought by the A-bomb at the end of the Second World War, it seemed that nothing the city produced would ever escape the shadow cast by that moment of obliteration - least of all a vibrant, carefree club scene.</p> <p>Yet with its sombre legacy permanently placed in the minds of so many, even Hiroshima's own mayor would be excused for doing something akin to the <a href=\"http://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ1yYJsQTPM\">Soulja Boy dance</a> when, in 2006, the city surprised everyone by <a href=\"http://gethiroshima.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiroshima-comes-in-133rd-in-top-cities.html\">climbing its way onto Lonely Planet's list of the Top 200 cities</a> in the world. It was praised for its unique nightlife, (comparatively drug free) drum'n'bass raves, and its inhabitants' unstoppable optimism for the new.</p> <p>It turned out that, while the rest of world spoke of Hiroshima in lowered melancholic tones, in its own heart a storm of creative hyperactivity was brewing, ready to spill over into the light of day in a shower of double-shooters and booming bass filters.</p> <p>But just as it teetered on the edge of greatness, it suffered a debilitating blow. In the same year as the Lonely Planet recommendation, a series of over-zealous police raids on busy nightclubs threatened to kill the movement dead in its tracks. In the bustling Nagarekawa district (think Soho sent for a sci-fi make-over), police forced their way into the busy El Barco, Twisters and Cover venues, forcefully holding any non-Japanese clientele for questioning while aggressively shooing everyone else out into the street. Some said it was a crackdown on criminal gang activity, others an aggressive measure for rooting out illegal immigrants. The police claimed, weakly, that the raids were in aid of infringement of the Public Morals Law \u2013 essentially, they were arresting people for the indecency of dancing.</p> <p>For whatever reasons the raids took place (and you can read Paul Walsh of events website GetHiroshima.com's own investigative conclusions <a href=\"http://www.gethiroshima.com/en/gethiroshima/Hype/2006/10/29/andthatsofficial\">here</a>), it undeniably threw Hiroshima's club scene way off course.</p> <p>British DJ and producer <a href=\"http://www.beatpick.com/browse.php?manufacturers_id=94\">Windcheater</a> moved to the city in 2003 from native Brighton, embroiling himself in its electronica scene. \"Things quietened down swiftly after the raids,\" he admits, \"places closed and I feared it would never recover. It bred a new negativity towards the city.\"</p> <p>But in 2008, things are changing. People's approach to performing and enjoying music may have fragmented, but it's still there. Local musician <a href=\"http://gotoizumi.web.fc2.com/\">Izumi Goto</a> and production collective <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/3pihiroshima\">Sleepyeye</a> have already made names amongst circles in the know, while rock band <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/nekomushi\">Nekomushi</a> even made it as far as SXSW festival in Texas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339105172\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2008/10/29/HiroshimaBand460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese musicians performing on the Ota river in Hiroshima\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Japanese musicians performing on the Ota river in Hiroshima. Photograph: Alex Hoban</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Although some clubs replaced their dancefloors with tables and chairs to coax back cautions punters, come sundown, Hiroshima's high streets come alive with teenage performers, wheeling out their amps and equipment to play to large groups of other youngsters basking in the warm evening air. Along the banks of the Ota river, fashionable girls in Harajuku styles consolidate their a cappella J-pop routines. The whole place espouses an eclectic, electric energy.</p> <p>The night Turning Japanese is in town, club <a href=\"http://mugen5610.com/\">Mugen 5610</a> is hosting \"the UK's largest dub soundsystem\" Aba Shanti-I. If it's not the largest, it's certainly the loudest. Though the club is not heaving, there are still more than enough people present to absorb most of the music's deafening bass vibrations. \"Things are getting better, thankfully\" says Windcheater, \"clubs are starting to stick their necks out again by putting on parties.\"</p> <p>Hiroshima is a place that has always overcome its troubles, so it's unlikely that a few ill-advised police raids will silence its productivity in the long run. If anything, a knock like this will lead the city to react in the only way that it knows best, and that's to come back stronger.</p>",
  "<p>In recent years technology giants Microsoft, Yahoo and Google have been widely criticised for their business practices in repressive countries such as China. But yesterday the trio tackled their critics by joining a new scheme to help protect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/censorship\">the freedoms of internet users</a> around the world. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org\">The Global Network Initiative</a>, a new human rights coalition, says it is working to help companies stand up to authoritarian governments in countries such as China, Vietnam, Syria, Burma and Iran.</p> <p>As well as the triumvirate of hi-tech companies, the group is also being backed by a wide range of campaigners and academic organisations, including <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.eff.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. The initiative aims to \"protect and advance user rights to freedom of expression and privacy\".</p> <p>The initiative's backers said it is more important than ever for technology companies to understand their role in protecting users around the world.</p> <p>\"The number of states actively seeking to censor online content and access personal information is growing,\" said <a href=\"http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/cmaclay\">Colin Maclay of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School</a>, one of the initiative's signatories. </p> <p>\"A strong code of conduct for companies embodies the most promising approach to dilemmas that neither national law nor international regulation can effectively resolve at this time.\"</p> <p>The companies joining the initiative have agreed to follow a list of principles, including a commitment to consider fighting unwarranted government demands in the courts.</p> <p>The support from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/yahoo\">Yahoo</a> denotes a remarkable turnaround for the three technology giants, which have all faced criticism over their human rights records. </p> <p>Microsoft was accused of capitulating to Beijing for its censorship of Chinese blogs, while Google faced a barrage of attacks after it decided to launch a censored version of its search engine index in China in 2006. </p> <p>However, it is Yahoo that has faced the most condemnation, in particular after it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/nov/14/news.yahoo\">handed the Chinese government details that led to the imprisonment of dissident journalist Shi Tao in 2004</a>.</p> <p>Tao is now serving a 10-year prison sentence for passing on a briefing document from the Chinese government to an American campaign group. He emailed the file - which explained how Beijing officials were ordering journalists not to write about the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre \u2013 from a Yahoo account, which was then traced back to him with the company's assistance.</p> <p>Last year Yahoo made a private settlement with the family of Tao and another journalist, but chief executive Jerry Yang said in a statement on the new initiative that he wanted to make sure that the company's \"actions match our values\". </p> <p>\"These principles provide a valuable roadmap for companies like Yahoo operating in markets where freedom of expression and privacy are unfairly restricted. Through the collective efforts of industry, advocates and government, we will continue to see technology and the internet as a way to improve people's lives,\" said the statement.</p> <p>The coalition also represents a truce between campaign groups and technology industry leaders, which have had testy relationships in the past. Human Rights Watch, in particular, had accused companies of having attitudes that were \"arbitrary, opaque and unaccountable\", and argued that technology corporations should be among the last to succumb to government demands.</p> <p>\"It was ironic that companies whose existence depends on freedom of information and expression have taken on the role of censor,\" said the group in 2006.</p>",
  "<p>Contrary to published reports, the presidential election won't happen until November 4. Those hundreds of thousands of robo-calls, the blizzard of TV ads, or other unforeseen events could propel a Republican team to the White House, leaving president-elect John McCain to assemble a cabinet to run the government. (See Barack Obama's potential green team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/network\">here</a>)</p> <p>The global economic crisis, for the moment, is dominating the headlines, but there is no doubt the next president will have to grapple with daunting energy and environmental issues fairly quickly once in office. For starters, fuel prices could careen upward again, and a post-Kyoto summit between 189 countries to hash out new greenhouse-gas reduction targets is set for Copenhagen in late 2009. </p> <p>McCain would need to decide quickly whom he would trust to navigate his climate, energy, and conservation policies through the tricky shoals of environmental groups, powerful Democrats in Congress, conservative Republicans, and industry barons. Not to mention the leaders of rapidly developing China and India ...</p> <p>So who would staff a McCain administration's environmental posts? Grand Old Party (GOP) Republican insiders, industry lobbyists, and think tankers talked to Grist about names being mentioned for a McCain government.</p> <h2>Secretary of Energy</h2> <p><strong>Pete Domenici</strong><br>Right-wingers who still challenge global warming, or at least linking it to human activities, say they don't have a glacier's chance in hell of being heard in a McCain administration on energy. But if they did, they'd pick Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) to lead the Department of Energy. Domenici, New Mexico's retiring elder statesman, is a backer of nuclear power who's a favorite among conservatives and industry groups, but they acknowledge he probably wouldn't get the nod. Politically, Domenici's tangential involvement in the U.S. attorneys firings wouldn't help him win confirmation, but more practically, he announced last year that he's suffering from a degenerative brain disease.</p> <p><strong>Heather Wilson</strong><br>Another New Mexican who gets mentioned is Rep. Heather Wilson (R), a Domenici prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who lost the GOP primary this year to run for Domenici's seat. McCain, who is pushing construction of nuclear power plants, might find Wilson hard to dismiss. Women and minorities are often traditionally picked for Cabinet posts. A former Rhodes Scholar, she has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where she supported nuclear energy, and on the Select Committee on Intelligence, which monitors nuclear weapons. Her district is home to the Sandia National Laboratories, and she is an Air Force veteran. \"From her background in national security, she knows the nuclear issues that make up much of Energy's jurisdiction,\" said Jack Pitney, politics professor at Claremont McKenna College.</p> <p>But environmentalists and others might fight her appointment. Wilson voted to scrap critical habitat for endangered species, and against a multimillion conservation fund that New Mexico farmers backed. The League of Conservation Voters put her on its \"Dirty Dozen\" list in 2002, citing her support for uranium industry practices that contaminate groundwater, and for mining company polluters.</p> <p><strong>James Inhofe</strong><br>Under their breath, industry groups invoke Sen. Jim Inhofe's (R-Okla.) name for this post. But it's hard to see an expanded Democratic Senate majority voting to confirm one of the most outspoken climate-change skeptics.</p> <h2>Environmental Protection Agency Administrator</h2> <p>The nation's top pollution cop, the EPA's mission is to protect human health and the environment under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Superfund law, and other regulations. Many career staff, scientists, and environmentalists say that under Stephen Johnson that mission has been impossible to carry out, citing his refusal to quickly act on a U.S. Supreme Court order to evaluate greenhouse gases as a public risk, among other decisions. Industry groups say he's gotten a bad rap, but know the winds of change are blowing.</p> <p>\"I think industry groups are all going to have concerns about anybody McCain will pick. In my mind it's going to be Lieberman, or somebody like that,\" said Frank Maisano, an energy specialist at the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani (yes, that Giuliani). \"Somebody like Sherry Boehlert who's a real champion of the environment.\"</p> <p><strong>Sherwood Boehlert</strong><br>Sherwood Boehlert, who retired last year after 24 years as a New York congressman, is still widely respected by Washington insiders as a consummate moderate Republican. He spent his entire career on the House Science Committee and is best known for his environmental policy work, including helping to design a pioneering cap-and-trade program to control acid rain, fighting for higher fuel-economy standards, and pushing to fund science and math education. He currently sits on the board of the bipartisan Alliance for Climate Protection, headed by former vice president Al Gore. </p> <p><strong>Joe Lieberman</strong><br>Many feel that Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) deserves his pick of plum administration jobs for faithful support of his Senate colleague. As coauthor with McCain of Congress' first attempt at a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse-gas emissions, he could make a good EPA administrator - or perhaps energy secretary.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Shays</strong><br>Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) shares McCain's positions on many environmental issues, including developing wind, geothermal, and biofuel energy, exploring for oil off the coast, and building new nuclear plants. He coauthored a bipartisan bill to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, promote renewable energy, and repeal some tax breaks for fossil-fuel industries.</p> <p><strong>William Reilly</strong><br>William Reilly, a longtime director at DuPont and former president of the World Wildlife Fund, is an investment capitalist who still wins kudos for his tenure at EPA under the first President Bush. In 2007, he pulled off a coup through the leveraged buyout of TXU, which reduced plans for a dozen new coal-fired power plants to three. </p> <p><strong>Christine Todd Whitman</strong><br>Christine Todd Whitman, the former New Jersey governor and later EPA administrator during much of George W. Bush's first term, is a woman who could deliver the message loudly that a McCain administration would not be the same as a Bush administration when it comes to energy and the environment.</p> <p><strong>Mary Gade</strong><br>Mary Gade said she was forced to quit as EPA administrator in the Midwest after tangling with Dow Chemical Co. over dioxin contamination. She is seen by many as a poster child for current agency abuses. She's also a Republican and corporate attorney who understands how EPA works.</p> <p><strong>David McIntosh</strong><br>Conservatives say David McIntosh, a Newt Gingrich Republican who gave up his House seat for an unsuccessful run for Indiana governor back in 2000, would be dandy, while environmentalists say he would be a doozy. McIntosh, now a D.C. law partner, served as executive director of former vice president Dan Quayle's Council for Competitiveness, where he worked to roll back environmental regulations and push a rewrite of the Clean Air Act that would allow polluters to increase emissions without notifying the public.</p> <h2>Secretary of Agriculture</h2> <p>This position executes farming and ranching policy (obviously), promoting agricultural production and trade. But it also administers ethanol subsidies and handles food safety and hunger prevention, including the food-stamp and organic-food-labeling programs. And don't forget that the Forest Service falls under this department, overseeing nearly 300,000 square miles of national forests.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Dooley</strong><br>Conservatives and industry representatives say if McCain is serious about appointing Democrats to high posts, this would be a good spot. They drool over Calvin Dooley, a former Democratic congressman from California's Central Valley who understands agribusiness issues. He was previously head of the Food Products Association and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, two major food-industry trade groups, and he's currently CEO of the American Chemistry Council. But he may be making too nice of a salary at his new job to be lured away for government service.</p> <p><strong>James Leach</strong><br>Some environmentalists, on the other hand, see a Republican they like. Jim Leach, a 30-year Iowa congressman who was defeated in 2006, is now interim director of Harvard's Institute of Politics, on leave from Princeton where he's a professor of public and international affairs. He \"was very much interested in reform and good government, and would not be susceptible to the kinds of political pressures brought to bear on farm policy,\" said Jim DiPeso, policy director for Republicans for Environmental Protection. But that endorsement speech Leach gave for Obama at the Democratic National Convention might dim his chances, not to mention his current job as leader of the campaign finance reform group Common Cause.</p> <p><strong>Ben Nelson</strong><br>Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson is another heartland Democrat who tends to be in line with McCain on a number of issues, particularly climate change. But they don't see eye to eye on ethanol subsidies, which McCain famously told Iowa voters he would cut. Taking a job in a McCain administration would give Nebraska's Republican governor the chance to appoint a GOP replacement, which could factor into Nelson's decision making, particularly if losing his seat would deny Senate Democrats the 60-vote supermajority needed to truly command the Senate.</p> <p><strong>Mark Sanford</strong><br>South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) wins praise from some who note he shares McCain's views on farm subsidies, but others say South Carolina is too far from the nation's corn fields.</p> <p><strong>Terry Everett</strong><br>Alabama Rep. Terry Everett (R) is from the South, not the Plains states or the West, but \"he knows ag backwards and forwards\" because of his long tenure on the House Agriculture Committee, said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</p> <p><strong>Edward T. Schafer</strong><br>\"Why not keep the current guy [Schafer] in place?\" suggested Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"He just came into the job a year or two ago.\" Well, the current agriculture secretary's chances of holding onto his job might be harmed by those E. coli outbreaks.</p> <h2>Secretary of the Interior</h2> <p>The nation's landlord, the Interior Department manages 500 million acres of land and the oil-rich Outer Continental Shelf, overseeing not just oil supplies but coal, natural gas, wind, solar, and geothermal too. The department also administers much of the West's water supply, national parks, relations with the nation's tribes, and protection of endangered species. Traditionally headed by a well-known Westerner, Interior has endured embarrassments in recent years, including meddling by a high-ranking deputy on endangered-species protections that allegedly could have affected her family farm, and drunken sexcapades by Minerals Management Service employees hobnobbing with industry representatives.</p> <p><strong>Dirk Kempthorne</strong><br>There's been some speculation that McCain might just keep current Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne in place. \"That would not be smart in light of the departmental scandals,\" said Pitney at Claremont McKenna College. Environmentalists agree, saying he has protected fewer endangered species than James Watt, is a strong backer of oil-shale leasing in the Rockies, and supported polluting industries as Idaho governor. They say he has done little to clean up agency shenanigans.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Maisano of Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. \"Kempthorne doesn't have an ounce of any responsibility for those scandals; in fact he's been part of the team breaking them up.\" Maisano and others say Kempthorne knows D.C. and the West well (as a former Idaho governor and U.S. senator). Kempthorne has come up to speed on the controversial issues facing Interior, including offshore oil drilling, the proposed listing of the polar bear as endangered, wind power leases, and coal mining permits. He is also as passionate about national parks as McCain. In fact, says Maisano, \"I would think Kempthorne might be more comfortable with the McCain camp than the Bush camp.\"</p> <p><strong>Jon Huntsman, Jr.</strong><br>Utah's Jon Huntsman, Jr. (R), another Western governor who is the son of a chemical magnate, would be more palatable to some. He has been more moderate than expected, and wants Utah to reduce fuel and energy consumption. He is also concerned about nuclear waste being stored in his state, which might raise red flags for McCain.</p> <p><strong>Barbara Cubin</strong><br>Right-wingers say it is vital for McCain to remember that to win and keep Republican support in the West, he needs to select a rural, lands-rights supporter \"who knows something about the history of federal lands and what the problems really are,\" said Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute. \"Someone from the intermountain West like Gale Norton, but who is not an urbanite like her.\" Rep. Barbara Cubin (R-Wyo.), a pro-mining, rural Republican who is pushing a bill that would require new refineries to be permitted within 90 days, would be ideal for them.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Allard</strong><br>Colorado's Wayne Allard (R), a veterinarian by trade who is retiring from the Senate, also would fit the bill for lands-rights GOP'ers.</p> <p><strong>Wayne Gilchrist</strong><br>Surprisingly, environmentalists and industry reps alike mention Maryland Rep. Wayne Gilchrist, a nine-term congressman who this year was defeated for reelection in the GOP primary by a right-wing conservative. Gilchrist is a senior member of the House Natural Resources Committee, and he worked for the Forest Service in Idaho for a brief period. But Ebell says it would be ridiculous to have an East Coaster running Interior, no matter how liked he may be inside the Beltway for protecting Chesapeake Bay. The real deal-killer could be his endorsement of Obama, though.</p> <h2>Bonus Position: Energy/Climate Czar (or Czarina)</h2> <p>The 2008 oil spike proved how politically potent energy issues can be. A President McCain might seek to demonstrate a firm hand by appointing a top White House official to coordinate administration policy on energy, with climate change also tacked onto his or her portfolio.</p> <p><strong>James Woolsey</strong><br>Jim Woolsey, the former CIA director turned climate-change and renewable-energy wonk, was hired by McCain during the primary season as a senior adviser on these issues. Some say he's the leading candidate for an energy czar job because he knows global politics so well and is a formidable advocate for domestic energy production as a security policy, not to mention for electric cars. Woolsey has already served under four U.S. presidents in a variety of roles. It would be interesting for the one-time head of the nation's secretive spy agency to sit down with world ministers to hammer out climate-change policy. \"I'm sure he can disarm them,\" quipped one Republican strategist. </p> <p><strong>Sarah Palin</strong><br>Sarah Palin, who has already said she'd like to handle the energy portfolio as vice president, might pull rank and keep the energy czar job for herself. Somebody needs to pick up where Dick Cheney left off, property-rights advocates and climate-change skeptics say. Environmentalists say not a chance. Palin has sued the federal government to stop listing of polar bears as an endangered species and pushed for more oil and gas drilling, among other moves. \"I think Sarah Palin would be great,\" said Ebell of CEI.</p> <p><strong><br>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong><br>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R) is termed out as California governor in 2010, can't be president because he wasn't born in the United States, and is looking for greener pastures. He's got megawatt star power and hands-on experience crafting an ambitious climate plan.</p> <p>\"I can't think of a better energy czar than Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" said DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection. He said that while the \"Governator\" could run for the Senate, \"I don't think he'd be interested. He's the sort of guy who likes to be in charge. \u2026 The best job for the Terminator is to hold a high-level executive position. He's demonstrated an interest in the issue, and he's got the policy right. There wouldn't be any on-the-job training there. He's done the bipartisan cracking of heads and gotten people together.\"</p> <p>Of course, AB 32 -- the California climate law -- has yet to be fully implemented, and Schwarzenegger's popularity has sunk amid the state's fiscal woes. Still, California and its toothsome governor could both be winners no matter who becomes president. Both McCain and Obama have said that unlike Bush, they would order a waiver granted to enable California to proceed with plans to regulate greenhouse gases from automobiles.</p> <p>Curiously, Schwarzenegger hasn't visibly campaigned much for his good friend John McCain (though he's scheduled to hit the trail in Ohio this week on the GOP ticket's behalf). There's talk in Sacramento that the reason is that he'd love to be energy czar for someone else: Barack Obama. With his spouse's Kennedy clan connections (cue the Maria Shriver endorsement footage), he might be ready to pack his bags.</p> <p>Schwarzenegger spokesperson Julie Soderlund laughed off all the talk, saying, \"The Governor is 100 percent focused on California and meeting the challenges the state is facing right now. So at this point the governor is not looking beyond the immediate needs of the state.\" She said he had done half a dozen in-state appearances for McCain, and would stump for him in Ohio on Halloween. Also, his air board's plan for cutting greenhouse gases would give free permits to polluters, which McCain favors, rather than the 100 percent auction that Obama supports. Some environmentalists say while Schwarzenegger has taken bold action at times, he has also vetoed or stalled on key protections, mollifying large utilities and the heavily polluting shipping industry, for instance. Trick or treat, anyone?</p>",
  "<p>\"With Maradona on board, Argentina's national football squad is like the Beatles,\" footballer turned businessman Guillermo Tofoni said last week. Tofoni's company WorldEleven markets Argentina's international friendlies and his comment about the famous Liverpool band was said in the context of how much Maradona's presence brings in terms of publicity when he travels with the squad.</p> <p>Today, the question on many an Argentine mind is whether the Beatles analogy reflects the rationale behind long-serving Argentine FA president Julio Grondona's shocking decision to appoint Diego Maradona manager of Argentina.</p> <p>\"Let's not jump the gun,\" Maradona told Radio Mitre a few hours ago. \"We've had a first meeting and Grondona's proposal really seduces me.&#xa0;But we still need to talk some more.\"&#xa0;But the headlines around the world have already been written,&#xa0;the news has broken and we have a story.</p> <p>Maradona has made no secret of his desire to remain linked with the national strip, and since Alfio Basile quit the job a fortnight ago there has been much speculation about who would replace him.&#xa0;In spite of Maradona's impressive and forceful campaign, conducted mostly through the media, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/17/argentina-worldcup2010qualifiers\" title=\"\">the people's choice seemed to be Carlos Bianchi</a>. Yet Bianchi's long-standing personality clash with Grondona seems to have been unsurmountable.&#xa0;By contrast, Carlos Bilardo, the manager who led Argentina to two World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990 - with spectacularly good results in the former and one of the ugliest football displays in the country's history in the latter - appears to have been able to overcome his long-standing personal feud with Grondona.&#xa0;In the proposed management scheme, Bilardo would be a crucial part of the committee that Maradona would front.</p> <p>\"It's a birthday gift I don't wish to unwrap until Thursday,\" Maradona says. He turns 48 on October 30 and the appointment is expected to be formally announced tomorrow. \"We're journalists, we don't ask questions,\" one hack told me off the record before going on to explain how the committee is expected to look: Maradona at the helm (\"I am the one who will chose the team\") with Bilardo in a semi-director of football capacity.&#xa0;Pedro Troglio, currently managing at club level in Paraguayand an ex-team-mate of Maradona's, would also be involved,&#xa0;as would Jose Luis Brown and 'El Negro' Enrique, both players from the 1986 World Cup-winning squad.&#xa0;Fernando Signorini, who worked for many years with Cesar Menotti and has been close to Maradona throughout his career, could take up a role as a fitness coach.</p> <p>One of the most popular chants for Argentina fans is: \"We will once again be the champions, just like in 86.\" Could this be the way forward?&#xa0;A handful of players, the same manager, and Maradona in charge? The reaction of the Argentine press has been one of incredulity.&#xa0; \"Bianchi would have been a more serious appointment,\" one vox-popped fan said. Journalists echoed the sentiment. \"It's not so much weird as absurd and shameful,\"&#xa0;one told me. \"My theory is that Grondona actually doesn't want Argentina to win the World Cup,\" another said.</p> <p>Most negative statements were uttered in the traditional off-the-record premise, while the media analysed where they stood in terms of towing editorial lines.&#xa0;But Daniel Arcucci, of <em>La Nacion,</em> was happy to be quoted: \"The risk is the destruction of the myth - how will someone so close to being a deity handle such an earthly task?\"</p> <p>The negative reaction mostly stems from Maradona's turbulent off-the-pitch track record.&#xa0;Notoriously unreliable, lacking in discipline, and with an innate contempt for established rules and corporate status quo, will he be able to impose order and focus among the players who could form one of the best squads in the world?</p> <p>I suspect he could.&#xa0;To footballers more than anyone else, Maradona is inspiring.&#xa0;His respect for the game and the craft of playing is contagious, and among the current squad there are players such as Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme and Carlos Tevez who have been close to him professionally.&#xa0;The younger superstars - Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, soon to father Maradona's first grandchild - will be in awe of him and hungry to learn.</p> <p>Let us not forget that Maradona's impact on those near him is immense.&#xa0;When he turned up to play in a charity match organised by Robbie Williams, Marcel Desailly was reported to have sat down and whispered: \"If Diego says something to me, I'll wet myself.\" Alastair Campbell wrote an epic feature about their encounter in which he - Campbell - came across as humbled.&#xa0;Commanding the respect of the players is not going to be the problem.</p> <p>\"He is going through his best moment of the last decade, without a doubt,\" Arcucci continued. \"Healthwise but also in terms of stability. Of course, with him, you never know how long it will last.\" Juan Pablo Mendes, from <em>Ole</em> sports daily, shared a meal with Maradona and several other journalists in Bolivia earlier this year following a match in support of President Evo Morales.&#xa0;\"He was mentally and physically better than he has ever been,\" Mendes told me. \"The question is whether he will be able to sustain the pressures of a job like this one.\"</p> <p>During this summer's Olympics, Maradona had a presence among the squad,&#xa0;invited in by manager Sergio Batista, another 1986 team-mate and old friend.&#xa0;In this informal way, by just being around and chatting and encouraging the players, it seems Maradona transmitted positives to the squad.&#xa0;But his formal track record as manager - short stints at Mandiyu de Corrientes and Racing de Avellaneda; about a dozen matches with each club and a total of three wins - leaves a lot to be desired.</p> <p>Is a great player necessarily a great manager? Is the art of football management, to quote a friend from these pages, more alchemy than pure chemistry?&#xa0;Maradona could be the greatest alchemist of them all:&#xa0;why not believe in magic?</p> <p>The reality has potentially terrifying consequences because until Grondona makes a statement of intent we are left wondering what the motivations behind this appointment are.&#xa0;If it is the idea that global marketing and scattering breadcrumbs for the seagull world press is good business, then football may suffer. As Diego Latorre, a forgotten hero who now pundits, put it to Tofoni when the Beatles analogy was uttered: \"The problem with marketing is that it's got to stop when the match starts.\" Until the whistle blows for kick-off, everything else will be conjecture.</p>",
  "<p>A woman who has multiple sclerosis today lost a high court battle to clarify the law against assisting suicide.</p> <p>A court of two judges expressed \"great sympathy\" for Debbie Purdy but ruled that clarifying the law on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide\">assisted suicide</a> could only be done by parliament.</p> <p>Purdy was diagnosed with MS in 1995. The 45-year-old had sought a high court declaration obliging the director of public prosecutions to make the position on assisted suicide clear. She wanted to know whether her husband, Omar Puente, a Cuban jazz violinist, could face prosecution if he helped her travel abroad to die.</p> <p>Purdy said she was \"very disappointed\" with today's decision.</p> <p>Lawyers for Purdy, who is from Bradford, West Yorkshire, argued that the uncertainty over prosecution meant the DPP was in breach of article eight of the European convention on human rights, which concerns respect for private and family life.</p> <p>Lord Justice Scott Baker and Mr Justice Aikens ruled that the DPP did not need to issue a clarification.</p> <p>\"We cannot leave this case without expressing great sympathy for Ms Purdy, her husband and others in a similar position who wish to know in advance whether they will face prosecution for doing what many would regard as something that the law should permit, namely to help a loved one go abroad to end their suffering when they are unable to do it on their own,\" Baker said.</p> <p>\"This would involve a change in the law. The offence of assisted suicide is very widely drawn to cover all manner of different circumstances ... only parliament can change it.\"</p> <p>The judges granted Purdy permission to appeal because the case was deemed to be in the public interest.</p> <p>Speaking outside the court in central London, Purdy said she hoped the appeal court would \"take a different view\" and called on parliament to re-examine the law.</p> <p>\"I don't understand how it can have got to 47 years down the line from the Suicide Act, from 1961, and no one has looked at it more seriously,\" she said.</p> <p>\"That just completely confuses me - that we could have got so much further down the line without any involvement from our politicians or leaders.</p> <p>\"I want politicians to debate what needs to be done, because if people talk about needing safeguards, protecting the vulnerable, we have to know what is necessary to protect people.\"</p> <p>Aiding suicide is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison in England and Wales.</p> <p>More than 90 British citizens have travelled abroad with relatives to countries in which assisted suicide is legal. Some cases have been investigated by police, but nobody has been prosecuted.</p> <p>Last month, it emerged that Daniel James, 23, was helped to travel to Switzerland to end his life. </p> <p>James had been paralysed from the chest down after a rugby scrum collapsed on him in March last year.</p> <p>He ended his life at the Dignitas clinic on September 12. His parents were with him, and prosecutors are considering whether they should be charged.</p> <p>Sir Ken Macdonald, the outgoing director of public prosecutions, has said he would not be willing to publish guidelines granting immunity from prosecution for assisting suicide. </p> <p>Speaking prior to today's ruling, a DPP spokeswoman said: \"It's for parliament to decide what the law should be and we operate according to the legislation.\"</p> <p>Purdy was supported in her court fight by Dignity in Dying, formerly the Voluntary Euthanasia Society.</p> <p>At the initial high court hearing, David Pannick QC, for Purdy, said she had very real personal reasons for seeking clarification. </p> <p>\"Her dilemma is that she wants to delay her suicide as long as possible,\" he said. \"She wants also to avoid the danger of her husband being prosecuted for assisting her.</p> <p>\"If he is likely to be prosecuted, then she is much more likely to travel abroad to commit suicide sooner rather than later.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Salafi Bookstore, Bradford<br>147 Lumb Lane, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD8 7SP<br>01274 395007</h2> <p>It has an enticing shop front and just gets better when you step inside.

The owner, Anys, is incredibly helpful and patient and will find the book you want with even the scantest infomation (even when it's out of print)! She hosts talks by local authors, runs numerous book groups (including two for under 16s) and has story-time for little ones on Saturday afternoons. All this and fantastic music too!

At the end of the day it doesn't matter how many comfy sofas and coffee shops they put in their store, they still can't gain the atmosphere of a local bookseller, someone who knows what their selling and, above all, whom they're selling it to! Radish does this, and more, because as well as books the shop also carries a massive selection of Fair Trade products. Their sense of community is not confined to the immediate vicinity but expanded to a global awareness.<br><strong>Stuart Hudson</strong></p> <p>Radish is a great little Fair Trade bookshop that also sells jewellery, clothing and odd knickknacks. Their collections of fiction and non-fiction are very well chosen, and the helpful staff can usually find something inspiring on their shelves when I've run out of ideas! They support local musicians by including them in their range of CDs and also stock hand-selected art print. This isn't the place I go to find books I want, it's the place I visit to find books I'd never thought of, or sometimes just for a chat and a browse.<br><strong>Matt Baxter</strong></p> <p>A refreshing change from bland old Borders and Waterstone's. The proprietor, Beth, has created a warm atmosphere, her commitment to Fair Trade is genuine, and her support for local music is widely respected. Radish fits well into Chapel Allerton. The area often attracts unfair criticism in the press, but in reality has a buzzing community scene and Radish actively encourages its customers to get involved. It's this community spirit I really admire. Radish is more than just a damn fine bookshop, It's a genuine part of its community. Its one of the nicest corner of Leeds I've come across, and the people out there need to know!<br><strong>Scott Thurlbeck</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.paper-treasures.co.uk/\">Paper Treasures, Whitley Bay</a><br>152 Park View, Whitley Bay, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE26 3QW<br>0191 252 3474</h2> <p>I would like to nominate Paper Treasures as an outstanding small bookshop, which in a very short time has become an important fixture in Whitley Bay.

It's a library, a haven, a temple, a place of open fires, coffee, and creaking leather chairs - somewhere you can take your love of books and bask in its sunny glow for hours on end. It's also a disused railway station in Alnwick, Northumberland, and it's got 14 years of book-swapping history behind it. You can sell them volumes you've finished with, and you're almost guaranteed to leave with more. They won't always have the latest celebrity tell-all, but you stand a good chance of digging out unexpected treasures if you do the decent thing and give yourself a good couple of hours there. Original serialisations of Dickens, decrepit (but lovely) tomes on being a good 1890s wife, beginners' guides to undertaking, they're all there.<br><strong>Georgina Turner</strong></p> <p>Slightly expensive second-hand books but a lovely location - they're housed in what used to be Alnwick Railway Station.

The turnover of shops on the high street is worryingly high, but this bookshop survives - it's just what the town needs.<br><strong>Pat Oddy</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookcase.co.uk/\">The Book Case, Hebden Bridge</a><br>Market Street, Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, HX7 6EU<br>01422 845353</h2> <p>Right in the middle of town with an expensively attractive window display to lure you in. It has every book I want, and even when it hasn't, the staff (all mad, thank goodness) always seem to know about it and usually get it in for me before I've had time to go home and come back again. Felicity knows everything and deserves a medal. They all deserve a steep pay rise. And they have fantastic cards to go with emergency birthday purchases.<br><strong>Kerry</strong></p> <p>The Book Case is splendid and I don't know what we would do without it. We live in France and, even with Amazon, there are often questions and glitches that mean we don't get the books we want when we want them. The Bookcase, on the other hand, does everything possible to help us, advise us, and supply us. On long rainy mornings it's a solace to ring up and have a gossip about books with Felicity, one of - if not THE - best read people in the British Isles. My favourite example of Bookcase behaviour: once we wanted a book that was out of print. They searched the second-hand bookshop across the road, got the book and sent it to us. I ask you, who could ask for more?<br><strong>Betsey Parker</strong></p> <h2>Rievaulx Books, Helmsley<br>18 High Street, Helmsley, North Yorkshire, YO62 5AG<br>01439 770912</h2> <p>A compact shop nestling just off the village square in this marvellous corner of the North York Moors national park. It stocks a good range of secondhand material, mainly biographical and historical, and boasts an excellent topographical section that has a bias towards Yorkshire. Recently it has added to its remainder section but in this respect it is trumped by the Bargain Bookshop that sits just 30m up the road. Best use of an hour? Select a volume and walk two minutes to the Feathers Inn. You can sit and read with a pint of Timothy Taylor's.<br><strong>Darren Holmes</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.coversavebooks.co.uk/\">Coversave Books, Knaresborough</a><br>1 Kirkgate, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, HG5 0BQ<br>0870 745 2969</h2> <p>This bookshop is 275 miles from my home - but it is the best place to obtain out-of-print titles. I have tried other book-finders but never met with such speedy, friendly and customer-conscious prices and service. My son and family live in Knaresborough, so we have visited the Coversave shop. It is certainly small, and shelf space is tight, but there is something for everyone. If any title cannot be seen and is not in stock on-site, rest assured Coversave will do their utmost to oblige.<br><strong>Peter M Howard</strong></p> <p>On a visit to Yorkshire last October, I entered the tiny and quaint CoverSave Books in historic Knaresborough. What a gem, obviously loved by the owners, who eagerly assist customers in any way they can. After purchasing a few items for our grandchildren, I mentioned that I had been looking for a certain book from my own childhood for over 40 years. I gave them details and within a month the book arrived at my Canadian address -I was absolutely thrilled. Elisa Stevens and her parents have come to feel like friends, through their e-mails and diligent research.<br><strong>Marina Midgley</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.citikey.com/business/10053910/\">Little Apple Bookshop, York</a><br>13 High Petergate, York, YO1 7EN<br>01904 676103</h2> <p>Nestling in the shadows of York Minster, the Little Apple Bookshop is a delight to all book lovers. Whether you are after the latest paperback, a signed biography or a quirky gift for any member of the family, the staff will happily serve you and make you feel very welcome. The book ordering service is excellent - usually next day - and puts the major retailers to shame.<br><strong>Sarah Jackson</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Abacus books, Altrincham<br>24 Regent Rd, Altrincham, Cheshire, WA14 1RP<br>0161 928 5108</h2> <p>A wonderful shop for the browsing bibliophile, crammed from floor to ceiling with all sorts of secondhand and new books, from the eclectic to the classic. Their sister shop, Jardine's, on King Street in Knutsford, has an equally varied and fascinating selection of new titles, and they're always ready to order in books or advise you. These are great family-run shops, with a lovely friendly atmosphere.<br><strong>Felicity James</strong></p> <h2>Bramhall Village Bookshop, Bramhall<br>44-46 Bramhall Lane, Bramhall, Cheshire, SK7 1AH<br>0161 440 7889</h2> <p>The Bramhall Village bookshop, right in the centre of Bramhall Village, is the best bookshop for miles, and has been for over 35 years. Its long-serving, friendly and knowledgeable staff make it a pleasure to visit, before you even begin to look at the expanse of books. I've been known to search for a book without knowing the author or title and, by briefly describing the plot, the staff have found it and given an educated opinion of it. They hold author signings, kids' holiday reading sessions and my everlasting memory will be the big party - fancy dress competitions, wizards on hand, cheerleaders etc - to celebrate the last Harry Potter. The range of stock, overall shop atmosphere, buying judgment, customer service and new initiatives are all outstanding.

I have used it since its inception, usually receiving ordered volumes within 48 hours. Its staff are energetic and delightful; I regard them all as good friends. They provide an atmosphere of courtesy, kindness and admirable generosity: one staff member has lent me several of her own books, which I might well have bought without her offer. Booklovers are encouraged to visit the shop simply to see what's new. Honesty compels me to admit that after our children left home, my wife has tended to chide me for filling our house with books. But most readers of this will forgive me.<br><strong>Dr Philip Markman</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://simplybooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=simplybooks&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000115&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Simply Books, Bramhall</a><br>228 Moss Lane, Bramhall, Cheshire, SK7 1BD<br>0161 439 1436</h2> <p>A brilliant bookshop. The owners Andrew and Sue are a delightful couple, always ready to help, advise or recommend a book. The shop is so well-stocked with lovely books that when I plan to buy one I often come out with three or more! With their background in education and contacts with local schools, children are well catered for: their events for children are always fantastic and over-subscribed. They also organise literary lunches, book signings and launches with well-known authors - always very exciting and well-attended. There is also a regular book club enjoyed by all members. I highly recommend a visit to Simply Books very soon and after browsing, try their coffee shop: in my opinion, it serves the best coffee in Bramhall.<br><strong>Gerald Anderson</strong></p> <p>Another very small bookshop. It opened about two years ago and Andrew Cant and Sue Steele had pictures up in the cafe (it has a tiny cafe, which is lovely!) of what the space looked like before they converted it into the delightful place it is now. I first visited it in connection with a visit to Bramhall High School, but Andrew and Sue are very supportive of local writers and I've been back there to do an event on more than one occasion. It's a really friendly shop where the booksellers know the stock and their customers, and are very kind to both.<br><strong>Ad\u00e8le Geras</strong></p> <p>As an author, in the past four years I've visited hundreds of bookshops. My favourite one has to be Simply Books. Sue and Andrew invited me for three days, took me out to dinner, put me up at their own place and organised a literary lunch at a nearby Italian restaurant. Brilliant!<br><strong>Caroline Lawrence</strong></p> <p>A very welcoming shop, with books to suit all tastes and an excellent children's section. The shop is not large but you can browse for as long as you like and never feel uncomfortable. Owners Sue and Andrew have even found room for two or three tables where you can enjoy a latte or a cappuccino, and they're planning to expand upstairs to provide more space forchildren's events. They will order anything, often having it ready to collect the following day. They really know their books, are well-informed about all the latest releases, and organise author events and activities and readings for children, both in the shop and elsewhere; they helped me bring two leading authors to an arts festival in a small Cheshire town. They do so much more than just sell books.<br><strong>Pauline Ward</strong></p> <h2>Sam Read, Ambleside<br>Broadgate House, Broadgate, Grasmere, Ambleside, Cumbria, LA22 9TA<br>015394 35374</h2> <p>Sam Read's is brilliant. It's not just that it's in Grasmere (though that helps: there's something fun about choosing a book - or, more usually, several - in hiking boots). It's that its two small rooms are crammed with classic and contemporary literature, history, biography, poetry and even philosophy. Everything seems to have been judiciously selected by someone with eclectic but impeccable taste. The trick is simply see what they have. Every time you'll come out with something you've been meaning to read for ages, seen reviewed but forgotten about, or never heard of but that looks fascinating.<br><strong>Chris Peers</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookscumbria.com/shop/about.htm\">Bookcase, Carlisle</a><br>56 Castle Street, Carlisle, Cumbria, CA3 8JA<br>01228 544560</h2> <p>A secondhand bookshop, spaced over three very grand and labyrinthine floors, with every conceivable subject covered in a well-ordered fashion. There is also a music department offering classical and jazz CDs and LPs. They also have a gallery of art works and a local reading group, and they promote art, music and book events. All this with a friendly service.Give it a visit!<br><strong>Ian Brough</strong></p> <h2>The Bluebell Bookshop, Penrith<br>8 Angel Lane, Penrith, Cumbria, CA11 7BP<br>01768 866660</h2> <p>This bookshop has been here for about 25 years and is independently run on an ethical/fair trade basis. Whenever you go in, there is something interesting happening - an exhibition (which might be anything from a local sculptor or Nepalese photographs). Recently there was an exhibition of wool insulation in the very large window space. I often wonder how/if Derek, the owner, actually makes a profit! It appears muddled and messy but Derek and the staff know where everything is and can get anything really quickly. Upstairs there is coffee, tea and Derek's raspberry scones and chocolate muffins. If he has time there is bread and cheese for lunch, to which you can help yourself. I haven't mentioned the books/CD's/maps - sections are labeled using handmade paper and there is a really good selection - from just published books to classics and specialist literature. Local authors and Cumbria also feature - but not too much! Oh and I nearly forgot to mention the brilliant childrens' section.<br><strong>Liz Hind</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ulverstonbookshops.co.uk/\">The Bookshop at The Tinners Rabbit, Ulverston</a><br>48 Market St, Ulverston, Cumbria, LA12 7LS<br>01229 588858</h2> <p>This is not just a bookshop - it is a meeting place, an events centre, a friendly haven in a small bustling market town. Liz Drew has, since 1999, made this the centre of cultural life here, assisted by her knowledgeable and helpful staff, Belynda and Melanie. Just around the corner is Liz's satellite bookshop dedicated to health, the environment and spirituality. Here one can relax with a coffee on the comfortable sofa while at the Tinners Rabbit there is an open fire, an armchair and beanbags for the children. As well as helping you to find just the book you want, Liz arranges free talks on matters of health and spirituality, runs a thriving and lively reading group and somehow finds time to organise an annual Readers' Day as part of a local arts festival.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.qype.co.uk/place/135966-Michael-Moons-Bookshop-Whitehaven\">Michael Moon's Antiquarian Bookshop, Whitehaven</a><br>19 Lowther Street, Whitehaven, Cumbria, CA28 7AL<br>01946 599010</h2> <p>Don't be deceived by the small frontage, it stretches a long way back. Michael sits at a very cluttered desk and seems to be on the telephone a lot, but this is all to the good as no-one spoils your fun. There are thousands of books to be perused: no leather sofas, no coffee, just books. The a smell of old perishing leather and mouldy pages is, to a lover of books, better than anything produced by a perfumier.<br><strong>Pamela Clatworthy</strong></p> <h2>Bestsellers Bookshop, Buxton<br>3 Bridge Street, Buxton, Derbyshire, SK17 6BS<br>01298 79521</h2> <p>Owned and.run by Lyndsey, the most helpful of bibliophiles. She and her minions maintain an excellent stock and are able to find the most obscure books in a twinkling of an eye.

Over 3.5m titles are available from the website, and the shop also organises the Peak Festival - an autumn event, which attracts popular writers and over 5,000 people.<br><strong>Mike Hennessy</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ckbroadhurst.co.uk/\">Broadhursts, Southport</a><br>5-7 Market Street, Southport, Lancashire, PR8 1HD<br>01704 532064</h2> <p>It's a joy to buy from a bookshop where the staff have a good literary knowledge, and you can explore as many nooks and crannies as you like, finding thousands of books.

A not for profit, workers co-operative that has a commitment for social change, it appeared to offer a host of magazines, postcards, music and of course books, that would not be readily available in a mainstream establishment. Walk into the store and find a book on Zapatista stories, or something for the discerning vegan, feminist, eco-activist, or concerned individual. Take plenty of time with you, as this place is captivating.<br><strong>Kevin Watkinson</strong></p> <p>The centre of my world is News From Nowhere, an independent, not-for-profit radical and community bookshop. It is run by a small collective of women workers.<br><strong>Ambreena Manji</strong></p> <p>This bookshop catches your eye even on the rather kooky end of Bold Street. It describes itself as a 'radical bookshop' which makes its seem loveable and not in the least bit threatening, an enterprise that gives new meaning to the phrase 'armchair anarchist'. A mosaic-like sign welcomes you. Walk in and the first thing that catches your eye is the blazing red of communist and socialist magazines. News From Nowhere wears its political colours in one shade only, but there is more to see. This is the centre of independent magazines in Liverpool, where 'zines such as Everything You Hate, on the Liverpool rock scene, nestle comfortably next to The Ecologist and The Idler. The staff are interested in your choices, but only if you want them to be, and this bookshop has radical literature of all kinds. It also has the largest collection of anti-George Bush books I've ever seen. News From Nowhere is interesting, provocative and gives the underground a step up.<br><strong>Jenny O'Mahony</strong></p> <h2><br><a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/home/255555/\">EJ Morten Booksellers, Manchester</a><br>6 Warburton Street, Didsbury, Manchester, M20 6WA<br>0161 445 7629</h2> <p>Situated in the oldest street in Didsbury in a building built in 1823, Eric Morten established his own bookshop in the front room of number four in 1958. Within two years he had moved into number six, and within a short time he had the whole row of small shops, from two to 10, which he now owns. This became a mecca for booklovers, not only in Manchester but throughout the world. The children's section is vast, there are educational books in abundance, and the latest titles are always in stock. Eric has been in the trade for over 65 years.

However, MAGMA, positioned in the bustling Northern Quarter, stocks an unparalleled selection of photographic, fashion, arts and graphic design books for the professional, student or merely curious. Additionally, a wall of British, American and European magazines offers up virtually every cultural title available.

Many times I sought advice as to how to encourage my young boys to read at a time where they were totally anti- reading. Thanks to the fantastic staff, my children have now become avid readers and I have found expert service that is rare indeed. A real gem.<br><strong>Martin Lewis</strong></p>",
  "<p>Homeowners hurtling towards negative equity and workers out of a job will have plenty of time to search for scapegoats over the next 12 months \u2013 and many may wonder why Mervyn King and his colleagues at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> failed to act earlier and more decisively, to cushion the overstretched economy against the worst effects of the credit squeeze.</p> <p>Early in the crunch, the Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee did take action \u2013 it made three quarter-point rate cuts between December 2007 and April this year. But as oil prices continued to surge, pushing inflation well above the 2% target set by the government, a majority of members believed there was too much of a risk that if they cut again, price rises would run out of control.</p> <p>But the Bank now faces having to explain why it has allowed the economy to slip into what looks likely to be a deep and prolonged recession. Only when they believed the world's financial system had been brought to the very brink of collapse by the disastrous bankruptcy of Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers did the MPC resume rate cuts, joining the co-ordinated half-point move as the world's finance ministers prepared to gather in Washington earlier this month. </p> <p>Now, they are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/29/creditcrunch-marketturmoil\">expected</a> to move fast, with another cut of half a percentage point, or perhaps more, almost a dead cert for next week's scheduled meeting, and more to come. Some analysts now believe rates will be down to 2%, from their current level of 4.5%, by the middle of next year \u2013 and they could go even lower. Japanese rates plunged to zero in their \"lost decade\" of deflation and recession in the 1990s, and some analysts believe deflation \u2013 falling prices \u2013 will soon take over from inflation as the most pressing concern.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidblanchflower\">David Blanchflower</a>, the labour market expert who commutes from the US to sit on the MPC, had argued for months that the damage inflicted on Britain by the credit crunch would far outweigh the risk of oil price inflation feeding through into pay packets, and creating a much-feared wage-price spiral. He has voted for a rate cut at every single meeting for the past year, sometimes urging a bigger-than-usual half-point reduction.</p> <p>With hindsight, it is hard to argue with his assessment. The Bank's quarterly <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/2008/index.htm\">Financial Stability Review</a>, published yesterday, gives a snapshot of the crisis; but it also offers a plethora of reasons why Britain's banks, homeowners and businesses were always going to be painfully vulnerable to a credit squeeze. In a blizzard of multicoloured charts, it shows an economy where lending had accelerated to break-neck speed, bearing less and less relationship either to borrowers' ability to afford to pay it back, or the underlying deposits held by the banks.</p> <p>The MPC's more hawkish members would defend themselves by arguing that it has only become evident in the past six weeks, since Lehman went bust, just how deep the financial crisis would become. It is also true that few experts predicted that commodity prices would fall off a cliff quite so abruptly as the crisis intensified, wiping out the main source of inflation fears at a stroke.</p> <p>The cost of a barrel of crude oil was close to $150 in mid-July, when hopeful investors still believed emerging markets such as China and India would emerge unscathed from the credit crunch, and continue hoovering up the world's raw materials. When that analysis was exposed as optimistic at best, the price plunged by more than a half, to around $65, soothing the anxieties of even the most hawkish rate-setters.</p> <p>But even if oil prices were still sky-high, the rapid deterioration in the labour market, and the decline in demand on Britain's high streets, would make it highly unlikely that workers would succeed in winning inflation-busting pay rises, or retailers would succeed in passing on rising costs to shoppers.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's insistence that Britain was \"well-placed\" to withstand the crunch always looked like the kind of politicking independent central banks mercifully don't have to indulge in; but the Bank must defend itself against the charge that it failed to see just how vulnerable the economy had become. Now, it will act fast; but with bombed out banks loth to obey the government's pleas to lend, lend, lend, homeowners may not feel much of the benefit \u2013 and they can jutifiably ask whether it is simply too little, too late.</p>",

  "<p>The civil war in Sri Lanka took a deadly turn today as rebel planes dropped bombs on the country's southern capital and the army pushed ahead with its jungle offensive in the north of the island.</p> <p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which has been fighting for a separate state in Sri Lanka fro 25 years, used light aircraft to attack a military camp in northern Mannar district of Colombo and a civilian power station just outside the city late yesterday. The bombing raids left one person dead.</p> <p>The military confirmed that three bombs had been dropped by \"LTTE aircraft over a military camp\" while \"two bombs\" hit the state-run power station, damaging some turbines. The authorities blacked out the capital during the raid and the night sky lit up with anti-aircraft fire. The attack marked the first time rebel planes had bombed the capital in more than a year.</p> <p>In an apparent response, the Sri Lankan army launched an assault deep into rebel territory, a ground battle that lasted for hours. Eventually the army said it had taken control of the town of Jayapura - part of its strategy to whittle away the rebels' de facto state in the north of the island.</p> <p>The government of Sri Lanka does not allow independent verification of the battles, only taking in journalists \"embedded\" with the army. This has led to accusations that officials are underreporting its own casualties and exaggerating its gains. Last week the defence ministry said that it decided \"suspend the reporting of all casualty figures in relation to the ongoing counter terrorist operation\".</p> <p>The LTTE's political head, B Nadesan, broke cover yesterday for the first time in weeks, giving interviews to Indian television and saying that there was little but boasting to the Sri Lankan army's claim that it would destroy the rebels.</p> <p>\"For the last 30 years it has been the practice of the Sri Lankan military to issue such reports,\" Mr Nadesan said. The rebel spokesman said that in 1995, the Sri Lankan army claimed 90% of the rebels strength had been destroyed.</p> <p>\"But within months waging a conventional war with the Sri Lankan military, our strength was demonstrated when we recaptured Jaffna. The Sri Lankan military claims that they have largely destroyed our strength and will soon capture [the rebel stronghold of] Kilinochchi.

There's fiction, poetry, reference, ecology, Peak District stuff, maps, cards, CDs and a smashing atmosphere (you have to breathe in to pass another customer, which always promotes a smile from both) and willing staff. 10 out of 10.<br><strong>Hilary Lloyd</strong></p> <h2>Peak Bookshop, Chesterfield<br>11 Low Pavement, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, S40 1PF<br>01246 201609</h2> <p>Peak Books in Chesterfield is the best book shop I have ever been in (and I've been in loads!). The service is brilliant - the staff are always helpful, polite and great at remembering their regular customers, even rewarding regulars with a card-based loyalty scheme. All the books are set out in an easy-to-find way, and if by some remote chance something isn't where it's supposed to be, the staff are always happy to help track it down. There's a great coffee shop as well, where customers can enjoy the best coffee in town and some home-made cakes and snacks.<br><strong>Dawn Goodall</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scarthinbooks.com/\">Scarthin Books, Cromford</a><br>The Promenade, Scarthin, Derbyshire DE4 3QF<br>01629 823272</h2> <p>Scarthin Books, in the old Arkwright village of Cromford, is for retrieving those rainy afternoons when visiting the Peak District. Advertising itself 'for the majority of minorities', there is on first acquaintance no apparent order - yet the brilliant staff can pinpoint the book you are after. Stuffed with old and new books, I used to worry that the weight of the books stacked floor to ceiling would crash through to the floor below until I realised that the books below, stacked from ceiling to floor, would never let this happen. The tea is served in pots, the coffee is freshly ground and homemade homity pie can stretch the quick morning visit till late afternoon. Last week I watched a dog enter, unsuccessfully search the shop for its owner, and leave. It seemed quite natural and proper. While I know these things would never happen in Waterstone's, this is the perfect chaos of Scarthin books.<br><strong>Charles Monkhouse</strong></p> <p>Only choice for me. Tucked between stone houses and an old chapel, it's more like a home than a shop (it doubled as the owner's home for years). It houses the most wonderfully and quirkily eclectic books - new and second-hand - anyone could want, it's the local forum for alternative thought, and the cafe serves brilliant organic meals, coffee and cakes. And the staff are great! I can never return from a day in the Peak District without calling in at Scarthin to recharge the batteries.<br><strong>Andrew Cooper</strong></p> <p>A gem. It's set in what looks like a small terraced cottage but turns out to be a tardis. Books are crammed into every available space over three floors and the original rooms of the cottage upstairs have been left in place so you wander into the bedrooms and even the bathroom, complete with bath. The books mix secondhand (in abundance) with new and there is a tea room with scrummy cake, fair trade coffee and veggie food.<br><strong>Joe Dunster</strong></p> <h2>Bay Tree Books, Glossop<br>High Street West, Glossop, Derbyshire, SK13 7AU<br>01457 862512</h2> <p>Seduced by the window display of Bay Tree Books and entranced by the smiling welcome, the literary riches on show will complete your surrender. There is no need to rush: coffee is waiting and a quiet room in which to read while the children have their own space upstairs with regular storytelling from a treasure trove of books. Technology will find and order all you desire and its handmaids, the two Sarahs, are never too busy to engage in friendly conversation as they fill your bag with delights. Perfect! What more does one need?<br><strong>Sylvia Sullivan</strong></p> <p>Worthy of inclusion in any list of good independent booksellers. They support local writers, they do an awful lot to encourage children's reading and writing and run a lovely little bookshop staffed by friendly people. All shops with books in are good but some are better than others.<br><strong>Mark Longley</strong></p> <p>This shop is a little goldmine of literature, from the classics to children's books. Sarah and Sarah, the owners, are informative, widely read and very focused on their customers. Downstairs is the adults' section where you get caught up and browse for hours. Upstairs is set out for children, with squishy seats and books to read while they're there. You don't just go there to buy a book - you go there for the experience.<br><strong>Bernadette Kean</strong></p> <h2>Chipping Campden Bookshop, Chipping Campden<br>Dragon House, High Street, Gloucestershire, GL55 6AG<br>01386 840944</h2> <p>It's no larger than a biggish bedroom and can't stock everything, but what it does stock is lovingly chosen by a well-informed and enthusiastic bookseller, who hand-sells every volume. Her enthusiasm shifted a thousand copies of Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring in hardback before the hype began, and the shop is in one of the prettiest high streets in the country. It's great.<br><strong>Ad\u00e8le Geras</strong></p> <p>Chipping Campden, one of the smallest market towns in England, boasts 20 independent retail outlets. If small is beautiful then Natasha Roderick-Jones' bookshop must be among the best. Natasha knows her market and her product. At Christmas, boxes of customers' preordered books (topics ranging from opera to classic tractors, Byzantium art to rock and roll) are crammed under a table bulging with the latest titles. The window display is constantly changing, there is a monthly tea and books session at the Cotswold House Hotel at which Natasha reads from her favourite titles and, guided by Natasha, the same hotel hosts literary lunches at which bestselling authors are invited to speak. There is nothing dull or dusty about Chipping Campden Bookshop.<br><strong>Charlie Bennett</strong></p> <p>Run by a woman with a passion for books, this is a gem of a shop with books displayed in bite-sized chunks instead of the 'pile 'em high' mentality which gives you indigestion. The subjects covered, though, are wide and eclectic, with an excellent choice of intelligent fiction (and the odd holiday read) and some superb non-fiction. Less known and deserving authors at last get a look-in. Natasha is also working with the local Cotswold House Hotel in arranging literary lunches which are attracting well-known names, and has pioneered a 'book club' introducing new writers and good reads.<br><strong>Annie Ashworth</strong></p> <p>Chipping Campden is a delightful town with associations with the arts and crafts movement, excellent cheese and bread shops, a wonderful real fruitier, a wine merchant and a summer music festival, but its delights are sealed by the Chipping Campden Bookshop. This is a genuine high-class bookshop presided over by Natasha Roderick-Jones and, at weekends if you are lucky, David Kingsmill. It is tiny, but there is not a wasted spot on its crowded shelves and what they do not have they will get for you within a few days. What is really excellent is their willingness to deal with orders by emails: I frequently order books by email and Natasha will reply as soon as it is in the shop. Natasha's current passion about Venice ensures a good supply of books on that subject! Long live small independent book shops like this.<br><strong>Bruce Coles</strong></p> <h2>Borzoi Bookshop, Stow-on-the-Wold<br>The Church Street, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL54 1BB<br>01451 830268</h2> <p>The Borzoi Bookshop was a place of fascination throughout my childhood and was a major influence on my interest in books and reading. What is special about this bookshop is how it manages to pack so much into a small space with window displays that always make me stop and which draw attention to books often not displayed in the larger bookshops. It has recently changed hands but is still run in the most friendly and efficient way. Just one regret - please can we have the red sign back?<br><strong>Paul Shackleton</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.inprint.co.uk/\">Inprint, Stroud</a><br>31 High Street, Stroud, Gloucestershire, GL5 1AJ<br>01453 759 731</h2> <p>A cornucopia of rare and secondhand art, architecture, cinema, photography and gardening books with smatterings of history, children's fiction, maps, hanging baskets, cinema gewgaws, copies of The Beano and laid-back, jazzy sounds stuttering softly from the stereo. The sort of shop a book-fiend would want as a living room.<br><strong>Adam Horovitz</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://bookshopstroud.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=bookshopstroud&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000130&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Stroud Bookshop, Stroud</a><br>23 High St, Stroud, Gloucestershire, GL5 1AJ<br>01453 756646</h2> <p>Can I nominate The Stroud Bookshop? It is quite small, but it has wonderful, helpful staff. When I first went in there I knew which book I wanted, but not its name, its publisher or its author. I came out carrying it.<br><strong>Katie Fforde</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.rossoldbooks.co.uk/\">Ross Old Books &amp; Prints, Ross-on-Wye</a><br>51-2 High Street, Herefordshire, HR9 5HH<br>01989 567458</h2> <p>There are only four secondhand bookshops of any merit in Herefordshire, and this is the best. It carries a fair range of stock, both secondhand and antiquarian, and specialises in books, maps and prints of local interest. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable and the shop is busy but not overcrowded. The back room is given over to books priced at \u00a33 and occasionally less, and contains some bargains - indeed, you could buy the lot and start a decent shop of your own.<br><strong>John Trevitt</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://biblion.co.uk/bookstores/Weobley_Bookshop.html\">The Weobley Bookshop, Weobley</a><br>Broad Street, Weobley, Herefordshire, HR4 8SA<br>01544 319292</h2> <p>Lucky village to have a bookshop at all! Karen Stout has moved her excellent six-year-old shop into a big timber-framed house on the main street of this lovely village. Still principally a second-hand shop offering booksearch, it has now expanded to provide a useful selection of CDs and new books, which can be ordered for collection often in 24 ours. The second-hand stock is wonderfully varied and reasonably priced. Open six days a week, too.<br><strong>John Trevitt</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.browsers.org.uk/\">Browsers, Leicester</a><br>26, Allandale Road, Leicester, LE2 2DA<br>0116 270 1684</h2> <p>A Tardis of a bookshop - small outside but with a wide range of stock. Staff are able to get anything quickly, and are well-informed across many areas - academia, local interest, children's books, etc - and are equally helpful, whether they're ordering hundreds of books for schools or a single volume for a difficult present. The owners are also involved in local events, authors' visits and so on. Good people, good company - an asset to Leicester!<br><strong>Liz Brandow</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.frontlinebooks.co.uk/frontline/content.asp?page=home\">Frontline Books, Leicester</a><br>73 Humberstone Gate, Leicester, Leicestershire, LE1 1WB<br>0116 251 2002</h2> <p>Leicester's best independent bookshop and a focal point for local activists. The bookshop is part of Secular Hall, which is home to the oldest Secular Society in the world and is used regularly by a wide range of campaign and community groups. Frontline Books also run reading groups and put on regular events (such as speakers nights and the new 'Not the. . . ' series of parties) as well as hosting an online directory of local activities. They are also heavily involved with the current refurbishment of the hall and are the only commercial concern to be allowed to affiliate to the local Social Forum. The shop is small but well stocked, selling everything from childrens' books to politics to erotica, and a range of magazines and pamphlets produced by campaign groups either locally, nationally or internationally. Well worth a visit!<br><strong>Keith J Baker</strong></p> <p>Shani Lee has done a remarkable job in building up this vibrant bookshop in the centre of Leicester. Allied to the Secular Hall where William Morris once spoke, the bookshop's stock mirrors the Hall's radicalism and free-thinking. It is a community hub: witness the live literature events, book launches and competitions. Where else could Bookdating (a variation on speed-dating but with a book as starter for the chat-up line) rub shoulders with a radical fiction reading group, or poets waxing lyrical (or not so lyrical) about male and female relationships with sessions on how to write a business plan? Yes, it's a training and resources centre too. The service is friendly, knowledgeable and interested and you'll get food and wine at most events. What more could anyone ask from their local independent bookshop?<br><strong>Pam Thompson</strong></p> <p>For anyone who has come to dread walking into a bookshop because they are now mostly populated with an identical handful of bestsellers, I enthusiastically recommend Frontline Books. Alongside the well-worn controversies of The Da Vinci Code, I am reminded of my first love - books. Real books. Titles to make you think, argue, jump up and down on the table, and get jumped on by. Little epiphanies stalk the shelves, daring you to find them. Go beyond the trend for cartoon-covered clones and photo-packed TV companions that contain little text. Head straight for the frontline.<br><strong>Radcliff Gregory</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.southwell-online.co.uk/localpages/bookshop.html\">The BookShop, Southwell</a><br>54 King Street, Southwell, Nottinghamshire, NG25 0EN<br>01636 816 324</h2> <p>A great little local bookshop. The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially to younger customers, who sometimes get a chocolate from the Belgian chocolate shop at the back of the bookshop. The selection is not vast but covers a wide range. Books not in stock can be ordered and delivered as quickly as Amazon - and you can chat with the staff. A visit to the bookshop on a Saturday morning is a great way to start the weekend - I often go there with my son. Support your local bookshop: use it or lose it!<br><strong>John Gallacher</strong></p> <p>This bookshop is a real gem. The stock is quite small, but always current, with lots of new titles coming in regularly (particularly in fiction, biography, cookery and gardening). There's a great selection of books with local links - either area authors, or dealing with places in the neighbourhood. The staff are unfailingly friendly, willing to help and chat with the kids (who can spend hours among the wonderful selection of children's books). Ordering books they don't have in stock is a breeze, and they normally arrive in either a day or two- and of course there's that chocolate shop at the back!<br><strong>Grenville Lannon</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.oldhallbooks.com/\">Old Hall Bookshop, Brackley</a><br>32 Market Place, Northamptonshire, NN13 7DP<br>01280 704146</h2> <p>A fantastic shop: good selection of new books in the front, wide selection of second-hand books in the back, and a collectable and antiquarian section. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff and a beautiful shop with a little garden out the back. Staff are happy to order in books (usually they will have arrived the next day) and they have a regular program of author visits and readings. Highly recommended - the kind of shop where you end up leaving with books you didn't know you needed!<br><strong>John Dixon</strong></p> <p>A great shop - new and old books and a huge range of titles and categories, in a fine old building. The staff are helpful, intelligent, cheerful and enthusiastic. The entire collection of books is splendidly arrayed, alphabetical order de rigueur - I know of none more comprehensive, while at the same time not so vast or scattered as to daunt the timid. The welcome at Old Hall - volume for volume - is peerless. And Tom the owner has inaugurated a great series of author readings - history/children's books/poetry.<br><strong>Graeme Fife</strong></p> <p>It has a room with new books - not a huge selection but if they haven't got it they will get it very quickly. The best part is a superb selection of second-hand books - four rooms with particularly good sections on the military, topography, the folio society, children's books, fiction and local books. The staff are very friendly and look after you well, and the place is very well run by the manager, Tom Dixon.<br><strong>Graeme Porter</strong></p> <p>I've always enjoyed rummaging in second-hand bookshops, stalls, and car-boot sales but generally a shop either sells new or second-hand - rarely both. The Old Hall has a large second-hand and new selection covering popular fiction, children's books, maps and reference books. They've even opened a small but perfectly-formed antiquarian section. Limited by space, they see it as a personal challenge to source whatever you're looking for. They've hosted successful author days, using their courtyard garden, and the staff truly seem to be \"book people\". In a small town increasingly given over to estate agencies, they do a fantastic job and help preserve the town's soul.<br><strong>Mike Barnes</strong></p> <p>The Old Hall Bookshop is the best in the world. Reasons:<br>\u00b7 It occupies a perfect Queen Anne house set back from the High Street. Gardens to front &amp; rear. No other business in the house.<br>\u00b7 All second-hand books are in alphabetical order of author, however cheap. Perfect for browsers with specific tastes.<br>\u00b7 Management's passion for classification means you know which bonnet your bees are in.<br>\u00b7 Stock MOVES! Vital for addict-browser. Policy: non-sellers to 50p shelf after a month, thence to 10p, thence off to charity shop. Result: no museum-feel, or deja-vu. Possible to visit once a week &amp; find new stuff.<br>\u00b7 Policy: if we don't stock it, we'll get it within 24 hours.<br>\u00b7 Staff brilliant. Tom Dixon, new manager, is a laughing, communicative Scotsman who likes the customer as much as the stock. Helped by Jackie, Chris &amp; Sharon - all great.<br>\u00b7 Cups of tea &amp; coffee on request; mostly without request.<br>Please go there.<br><strong>Bruce Smith</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://kingsthorpebookshop.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.direct/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=kingsthorpebookshop&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000021&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Kingsthorpe Bookshop, Northampton</a><br>6 Harborough Road, Northampton, Northamptonshire, NN2 7AZ<br>01604 715989</h2> <p>When you walk in they ask you if you need a hand or if you're looking for a specific book. The minute you enter you feel at home which makes it really inviting; the layout is spacious and the categories useful if you're looking for a specific book. They usually have a vast array of books, or will order them for you in a matter of days. The books are generally quite cheap - if an individual one is a little bit expensive, you don't mind paying extra because it comes with good customer service.<br><strong>Anon</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.booksandink.co.uk/\">Books &amp; Ink, Banbury</a><br>4 White Lion Walk, Banbury, Oxfordshire, OX16 5UD<br>01295 709769</h2> <p>Books and Ink opened just a few months ago. Selling second hand, remaindered and antiquarian books, the shop is clean, fresh and light, the staff helpful, the sofas comfortable and the coffee is free! There is a good general stock plus more expensive first editions and the like. If they haven't got what you are looking for, they say they can find it and a lot of people seemed to be using their free search facility when I was there. This is Sheryl and Sam's first business venture and I think they have redefined what a second hand bookshop should be. It's wonderful.<br><strong>William Root</strong></p> <p>A friendly and inviting shop, it encourages browsing. A place to sit and read and think. The best find since my Hay-on-Wye trip last year. Every category of book included and a willingness to search for any book you may want. It puts all other second-hand books shops to shame and gives a refreshing, clean feel to an otherwise musty market!<br><strong>Alison Root</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://chippingnortonbooks.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx\">Jaffe and Neal, Chipping Norton</a><br>1 Middle Row, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, OX7 5NH<br>01608 641 033</h2> <p>Somehow, Saturday morning shopping in the town always leads one here. It's virtually impossible to enter without buying - not because of any pressure but because of the way in which this bookshop works: the title just read about in the newspaper is there on the shelf or Patrick or Polly Neale, knowing their readers' tastes, will mention another ... Books not held in stock are acquired within a day or two; nothing is too much trouble - mention a half-remembered, half-identified title and the search is on! Patrick and Polly care: about their customers and about their books.<br><strong>Mary Sutcliffe</strong></p> <p>Since their move into a Grade II listed building in the Market Square, the owners have added a cafe at the front and an art gallery upstairs, but it is still very much a bookshop. The lighter, more open new shop has brightened its corner of the square and the knowledge, service and child-friendliness is still second to none. Jaffe and Neale found an out-of-print biography for us that no bookshop in Oxford had been able to find.<br><strong>Chris Hogan</strong></p> <h2>The Bell Bookshop, Henley-on-Thames<br>52 Bell Street, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, RG9 2BL<br>01491 572583</h2> <p>A haven for locals and visitors. I know of one UK expatriate living in France who makes regular visits to stock up - and I have an American friend who frequently emails me with requests for books (which usually means two copies as I am tempted as well). The shop's stock is comprehensive with any out-of-stock book available often within 24 hours. It also features an extensive stock of local interest books - rowing and the river (inevitably), walking in the Chilterns and the adventures of local cricket clubs.<br><strong>David Cairns</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.qi.com/\">QI Bookshop, Oxford</a><br>13 Turl Street, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX1 3DH<br>01865 261507</h2> <p>By the same minds that bring the programme on television, the QI bookshop is one of the newest in Oxford and already a huge hit. The shop is simply - quite interesting. It has a fascinating filing system where instead of, crime, horror and fantasy/science fiction you get Greed, Displacement, Power etc as your categories. And if you think a book is in the wrong section go ahead and argue - it's actually encouraged. Accompanied by a great coffee shop and bar with an atmosphere that is conducive to just sitting and reading your paper or discussing the mating habits of Vietnamese pot bellied pigs with the absolute stranger sitting next to you, QI is definitely a bookshop that merits a visit.<br><strong>Partha Bose</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reservoirbooks.com/#books\">Reservoir Books, Oxford</a><br>84 St Aldates, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX1 1RA<br>01865 423605</h2> <p>Rather surprisingly, Oxford suffers from a real deficit of quality bookshops, while the Goliath Blackwell's dominates the academic market. This makes the unique enterprise that is Reservoir Books even more valuable. Located in a 16th-century building opposite Christ Church, Jonathan Ungar's long-term project is to eventually turn the place into a civic and cultural centre. The entire stock is made up of donations from individuals and publishers, and is unique for a complete absence of dross on the shelves. And what a stock. A discriminating selection of academic books at incredibly reasonable prices compared to more commercial rivals make this an unmissable stop. History, politics and philosophy are particular strengths, and there's also a film club with titles available to rent at \u00a32. A small cafe at the front has fallen by the wayside, which is a pity. Every college town deserves somewhere like Reservoir Books. Few have them.<br><strong>Tadgh O'Sullivan</strong></p> <h2>The Book House, Thame<br>93 High Street, Thame, Oxfordshire, OX9 3HJ<br>01844 213 032</h2> <p>Friendly, efficient, helpful, with a comprehensive and up-to-date stock. Brian and Louise, the owners, have a large and loyal band of customers, and deserve even more. The book ordering service is prompt and efficient. Knowledge of recently reviewed books is extensive. Better and more convenient than visiting Oxford, or Aylesbury, which is more remarkable for closing bookshops than retaining them.<br><strong>Peter Cass</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.burwaybooks.co.uk/\">Burway Books, Church Stretton</a><br>10 Beaumont Road, Church Stretton, Shropshire, SY6 6BN<br>01694 723388</h2> <p>I run a day nursery and frequently buy children's books, books on business and gifts for friends. Burway Books is an unusual place - its staff know what's there, and they know how to find out whether a book is available if you need to order it. They are informed and friendly - two rare commodities these days. We are very lucky.<br><strong>Moriel Gidney</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.fwks.co.uk/mmb/bookshop.html\">Much More Books Ltd, Much Wenlock</a><br>6 High Street, Much Wenlock, Shropshire, TF13 6AA<br>01952 727992</h2> <p>A great shop for losing hours in; there are so many different second-hand books on such a wide variety of subjects that you always come out with something you didn't expect, and usually at a bargain price. They also have loads of old comics and even past football match programs. The staff are really great and friendly and we like talking to them almost as much as looking at the books. Much More Books is how I think all bookshops should be, about books and not making money.<br><strong>Clare Davies</strong></p> <p>This weekend I found myself in Much Wenlock, and wandered into Much More Books. I received friendly service and immediate responses, which opened up further reaches of this remarkable shop. And I congratulated the lady, who turned out to be Mrs. Challinor, the new owner. The bookshop is extensive and well planned, the staff are friendly and competent; in my opinion, it deserve support.<br><strong>RG</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wenlockbooks.co.uk/\">Wenlock Books, Much Wenlock</a><br>12 High Street, Shropshire, TF13 6AA<br>01952 727877</h2> <p>Browsing through Wenlock Books is as much part of the culture of Much Wenlock as drinking in the pubs or queuing at the butcher's. It's a bookshop with heart, where you feel the books have been selected because you might be interested in them, rather than foisted on you by aggressive marketing departments. With new and second-hand books, there is a lightness of touch here and a real consideration for readers. Apart from the reading groups and book signings, organised by Anna who runs the shop, you get the feeling that even in deepest Shropshire - or perhaps particularly in deepest Shropshire - you are connected to a wider exciting world.<br><strong>Paul Evans</strong></p> <p>A wonderful, friendly bookshop where you can escape from the world into an atmosphere of quiet enthusiasm. Anna Dreda's love of books - and the people who love books - is infectious. She will order anything for you and, if you don't know exactly what you're looking for, suggest something which will probably turn out to be your favourite book. Her presence fills the shop belying its size. She can supply everything that a big book chain can (including coffee) and much, much more. This is an example of retail therapy at its very best!</p> <p>Wenlock Books is owned and run by the wonderful Anna Dreda. She loves books and people - and it shows! Downstairs there is a stock of new books whose range belies the space (\"crammed\" would be the wrong word, as everything is clean and spacious); upstairs there's a well-ordered range of second-hand stock. If you can't find what you want, Anna will order it for you and phone or email when it arrives. Drop in when she's not too busy and there could be tea and cake. A wonderful shop.<br><strong>Anne Amison</strong></p> <p>A warm and cheerful welcome from a knowledgeable staff, most often the owner Anna. Situated in the centre of this very ancient market town it is all a bookshop should be. A wonderful selection of up-to-date publications carefully displayed, a stupendous collection of local books about Shropshire (Anna gives wonderful support to local writers), and a real children's corner complete with table and chairs, interspersed with CDs, art work, cards and maps. Then go upstairs! You'll find one of the best-organised collections of antiquarian and second-hand books on every possible subject. No tat or heaving boxes of rubbish, just good books. There are even comfy chairs, and if you're there at the right time a cup of coffee in some locally made cups. If my wife loses me, as she often does on a shopping trip to Much Wenlock, that is where she will always find me. To add to all this, the shop itself is a carefully restored wooden frame building complete with wattle and daub. It's worth a trip to Shropshire just to visit it.<br><strong>John F. Marcham</strong></p> <p>Anna Dreda runs the friendliest, most efficient bookshop I have found. She shows no concern at having to find the most obscure titles with the scantest information, and somehow manages to get them in double quick time. She is also very good at suggesting titles or informing you of new books by a favourite author. The mix of books stocked is wide and nothing is too much trouble - the coffee's good too!<br><strong>Jo Lashly</strong></p> <p>I've used the bookshop for many years and always found it a delightful place to visit, both as a building and a shop - it's timber framed, and packed with an interesting selection of old and new books. The stock isn't as big as our local Waterstone's, but it's always a good selection and anything ordered, even slightly obscure books, always turn up promptly. I should declare an interest as Anna commissioned me to produce some drawings of the shop, which are now part of the logo, and I've had a couple of exhibitions there - but I'd support it anyway.<br><strong>Andrew Naylor</strong></p> <p>What makes Wenlock Books special is the warm and lively personality of the owner, Anna Dreda - a genuine book enthusiast. She is brilliant at finding just the title to suit every customer's requirements, probably has it in stock already and if not will get it for you as quickly and efficiently as anyone. All the customers seem to be her friends and all her friends are customers! With a large second-hand section, a cosy kiddies' corner, and an in-house book club, Anna has made 'the bookshop' a social and cultural centre for the Wenlock area and far beyond.<br><strong>Graham Timmins</strong></p> <p>In the past, at Wenlock Books, you might have found a note pinned to the door - briefly the shop would be yours and yes, you might well find yourself taking an order. A moment later an ebullient Perce Muscutt would return and conversation and laughter would ensue. When Perce was away sailing or ballooning there was always the chance of meeting Anna instead and one would know instinctively that she was in residence; there would be flowers and a smile that bloomed. Anna has been passionate about Wenlock Books for 15 years and, now that she owns it, has instigated the changes that she dreamt of. Wenlock Books engenders loyalty, oh yes it does; books seen elsewhere are ordered from Anna. I have been introduced to authors and musicians within those walls and am grateful. We live in France now; is there someone like Anna Dreda here?<br><strong>Ian Warburton</strong></p> <p>I came across this bookshop 20 years ago when I first moved to Shropshire. It has remained independent and inspirational; full of character, oak beams and new as well as second-hand books. Now under Anna's care, it has become even more welcoming: there is always someone knowledgeable to chat to about books or anything else, book groups Anna has inspired are multiplying, and there's always tea and cake at four! It is a real pleasure to browse both the new books and the old and I almost always come away with a book I enjoy reading - often by an author I had never heard of, on a theme I had not considered. My greatest praise for a bookshop!<br><strong>Lindsay Ward</strong></p> <p>Anna's place is a haven of calm and inspiration, a true community centre. Tea is served to anyone present at 4pm at the round table where ideas are exchanged and friendships are made. There are opportunities to join reading and dancing groups. It's also a very good bookshop providing an excellent service including an excellent selection of CDs and maps! The shop stocks a wide range of contemporary and unusual books, has an extensive second hand section and if you can't go in person, undertakes telephone orders and postal delivery. But going there is much better for the soul!<br><strong>Rachel Roland</strong></p> <p>It's on the other side of the country but I visit whenever I can, and just wanted to add my voice to those above. There really is something special about Wenlock Books that sets it apart from other bookshops - the building, stock and staff are all spectacular, but it's so much more than the sum of its parts. It's the kind of place I imagine you had in mind when you started this project. For as long as it continues to flourish, I'll keep visiting!<br><strong>Elaine Franklin</strong></p> <p>A chance visit while on holiday in the area seven years ago has brought me back almost every year since. What a place: a selection of books that feel as if they've been chosen with me in mind, and views onto one of the most beautiful streets in England while you're browsing. Wenlock Books has ruined me for other bookshops - nowhere else can possibly compare.<br><strong>Pete H</strong></p> <p>Anna's bookshop in only 100 words? How many superlatives would you like? Drop by anytime and all the words will come to you!<br><strong>Ann Wishart</strong></p> <p>Tastefully converted from a 14th-century listed building, it offers light and space in its presentation of books, new and used. I made a bee-line upstairs to the generously stocked area of second-hand books, a treasure trove of volumes representing every desired specialty, each section clearly labelled. My wife set off to explore the town while I became completely absorbed in the search for favourite authors.</p> <p>Anna, the owner, gave us the warmest of welcomes and her friendly manner and extensive knowledge made our visit a delight, reinforced by complementary coffee served in attractively simple local pottery while seated at a good-sized round table surrounded by delectable books.</p> <p>We will be back.<br><strong>Dr Roger Hurding</strong></p> <p>A wonderful bookshop at the heart of the community. It's not big but it is clever! It is filled with wonderful books, tables and comfy chairs, yet the place feels spacious, is well-organised, and whisks you away from the outside world. Whatever Anna has discovered to create this haven should be bottled and sold to every bookshop. And the journey she organised on a local steam train at midnight for the latest Harry Potter launch was sheer genius. All my friends who waited in the cold outside a Waterstone's for their copies are jealous!<br><strong>Sarah Shires</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.jamesredshaw.co.uk/\">James Redshaw, Lichfield</a><br>2 Dam St, Staffordshire, WS13 6AA<br>01543 254825</h2> <p>Run by a Mr James and a Mr Redshaw, it's in the centre of Lichfield, just off the Market Square. The front of the shop is given over to children's books, with novels and then a room of reference books to the rear. Upstairs are maps and local history. It's a great shop to browse in, and they are only too happy to order any book you want. Just go back a week later and there it is, however obscure. It's very comfortable and friendly (very child friendly) and is involved with and supports local literary events. I've been using it for nearly 30 years and I now go in with my daughter who I hope will be using it for another 30.<br><strong>Nigel Lee</strong></p> <p>I've known James Redshaw Ltd. for more than 25 years, as a source for school and university for my teenage son, reference books for my husband, and theology, psychology and gardening for me. In interconnecting rooms stacked high with books on every conceivable subject, you can browse happily for hours. Returning to Lichfield after a 10-year absence I am now finding wonderful books for my grandchildren also.<br><strong>Eunice Connon</strong></p> <p>\"The best book shop in the world\" according to Maeve Binchy - but James Redshaw Ltd is more than that. It's a haven of wit, bilingual advice and courteous, friendly assistance. Since 1975, proprietors, Ralph James, MBE, Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques, and Clifford Redshaw, have brought dozens of authors to the city through their annual Literary Dinner. They were dubbed the 'Ant and Dec' of Lichfield by Barry Cryer, astutely discerning the fond esteem of customers. They host a reading group and a publishing imprint. Books ordered online or in the shop are there next day. Wonderful! Unique!<br><strong>Celia Warren</strong></p> <p>I love it because it is there - on my doorstep, not a train ride away. Ralph James is always around in the shop, greeting his regular customers, charming and helpful to everyone and always enthusiastic about books. The staff are helpful and go to endless trouble to track down just the right edition of whatever obscure book you're after. Messrs James and Redshaw also publish local authors, holding book launches for diffident new writers and encouraging them to take the plunge. They are also responsible for an annual Literary Dinner which is swiftly booked out, and guarantees a stimulating evening with two prestigious speakers from the world of writing. Lichfield would be much the poorer without these enterprising and enthusiastic men.<br><strong>Jane Russell</strong></p> <p>Joan is able to deduce, from<br>Any hint to which I<br>Might allude, the very title of that<br>Elusive gift for<br>So and so.</p> <p>Ralph will interfere, but never fear,<br>Elsewhere, in the shop<br>Denita, or Wendy, or<br>Susan will be around to<br>Help.<br>And with Cliff on hand as<br>Well, here in Dam Street</p> <p>Lichfield, we have the very finest independent.<br>This bookshop, if we are not to risk its loss,<br>Dear reader, should be on your calling list.<br><strong>Trevor Harvey</strong></p> <p>In the shadow of Samuel Johnson's house you will find the bookshop of Ralph James and Clive Redshaw. Their staff are not content to just link writer with reader through selling books. There is the monthly bookclub and the literary dinners (they've had 28 so far); check their website for photos. Local writers can have their work published by Lichfield Press - part of the empire. Their customers are not swayed by three-for-two offers or the smell of Arabica beans. Nor are they anonymous names on credit cards. No, they are welcomed like family friends.<br><strong>Marjorie Neilson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.webberleys.entadsl.com/\">Webberley's Bookshop, Stoke-on-Trent</a><br>Percy St, Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, ST1 1NG<br>01782 222 111</h2> <p>Very old, very inviting and quite the antidote to the chainstore branch 50 yards away. It plays no muzak, has no coffee shop or large 'comfy couches' to clutter-up the floor space, and no urgent trendiness; just plenty of shelves of books ranging from academic titles (for the local universities of Keele and Staffordshire), art books (where my father spends hours browsing and occasionally dipping into his pension) and food and drink titles galore, to a large children's section. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable and respond promptly to my emailed enquires from Italy, where I live.<br><strong>Mike Beech</strong></p> <h2>The Old Bookshop, Wolverhampton<br>53 Bath Rd, Wolverhampton, WV1 4EL<br>01902 421055</h2> <p>A cosy secondhand bookshop, just on the border of Wolverhampton city centre. It's close to a large park, and it's tempting to buy a book in the Old Book Shop, forget about work and sit down in the park and read. Books reach up to the ceiling, and you frequently have to manoeuvre round the stacks of books to get to your chosen for section. The staff are extremely helpful and know where to find nearly every book in store. Even when they don't sell a certain book, you can expect a phonecall from them soon afterwards to say they've found you a copy from somewhere else. The shop is sometimes frightfully empty, and its out of town location doesn't attract too many customers. Independent bookstores are hard to find in the Black Country, so please let this one survive!<br><strong>Rosa van Doorn</strong></p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.myclapham.co.uk/clapham/shops-mybackpages.htm\">My Back Pages, Balham</a><br>8-10 Station Road, Balham, SW12 9SG<br>020 8675 9346</h2> <p>Balham seems a fairly benighted place at first glance, with nothing but a sparsely-stocked WH Smith. But tucked away opposite the mainline railway station is one of London's best second-hand shops, called My Back Pages for the delight of Dylan fans. Inside, there's a small selection of new books, mostly cheap classics, and a huge selection of second-hand. History, classics, politics and psychology are all well covered, and fiction takes up a room to itself.<br><strong>Sean Clarke</strong></p> <p>With Streatham and Balham served only by a couple of blighted Smiths and a few charity shops, Back Pages is great. Unusually, the shop presents new and used books next to each other on the shelves, meaning you can stay in there, absorbed, for hours. I nipped in on the way to the Bedford once and was 45 minutes late to meet my friend. Whoops. But I had bought a map of Czechoslovakia. Yup, Czechoslovakia. Love that shop.<br><strong>Jonathan Vincent</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bookmarks.uk.com/cgi/store/bookmark.cgi\">Bookmarks, Bloomsbury</a><br>1 Bloomsbury Street, WC1B 3QE<br>020 7637 1848</h2> <p>Although it is a shopfront for the Socialist Workers Party, it stocks a wide range of books, both new and secondhand, that you are hard pressed to find anywhere else. The secondhand section is absolutely superb for picking up hard to find journals, publications and pamphlets of the Left, both in Britain and overseas. When I came to the UK to research the British left, Bookmarks was as a valuable source as any library.<br><strong>Evan Smith</strong></p> <p>Bookmarks is now the only bookshop in central London that specialises in socialist material, and is one of the main outlets for literature published by trade unions and the labour movement in general. It is, in fact, more than a bookshop, as it provides bookstalls for trade union and labour movement conferences and major meetings, and is always to be seen operating from under gazebos at major demonstrations. It also provides facilities for writers to present their books, either at the shop itself or, for larger occasions, at the nearby church in Shaftesbury Avenue. In this sense, it is a rare gem, not only for London but the UK as a whole.<br><strong>Alan Gibson</strong></p> <p>Bookmarks has a great range of books that you don't see in mainstream bookstores - lots of material on trade union issues, women's rights, the fight against racism, gay liberation, the history of class struggle etc ... plus some sound books for kids. You can get everything in one place, and actually flick through the books you're interested in. They also do a mail order service if you're not living in the capital.<br><strong>Peta Bulmar</strong></p> <p>I want to nominate Bookmarks. I love the fact that it makes no pretence to be neutral. It's on the side of all those fighting for a better world - books are weapons! At the same time it's completely non-sectarian and represents all aspects of socialist and dissident thought.<br><strong>Iain Ferguson</strong></p> <p>Bright and cheerful, conveniently located near the British Museum, Bookmarks stocks a vast range of socialist and radical books. Where else could you get good advice on the latest books written on the environment, anti-globalisation, antiwar movements, and the history of the labour movement? These days books can always be bought from Amazon etc, but good advice on what is worth reading is hard to get. Bookmarks gets my vote.<br><strong>Kambiz Boomla</strong></p> <p>More than just a bookshop - a way of thinking and acting about the world. They appear not only in their central London shop but at union conferences, demos and political rallies. A resource to be visited over and over. They produce a quarterly Review of Books with an exciting line up of book launches and speakers. My only regret is that I don't get over often enough.<br><strong>Willy Cumming</strong></p> <p>In a sea of identikit commercial multiples it is difficult enough to come across independent bookshops - but to find one with such a distinct sense of purpose as Bookmarks is seriously good news. This bookshop is not shy about its politics; it proudly identifies itself with the trade union movement and the thinking Left. An antidote to the spin culture of New Labour, you might say. What a breath of fresh air! We need more of these kinds of bookshops - everywhere.<br><strong>Tugrul Kaban</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://trustedplaces.com/review/uk/london/shop/1f9327l/gosh-comics\">Gosh!, Bloomsbury</a><br>39 Great Russell Street, WC1B 3PH<br>020 7636 1011</h2> <p>Quite simply the best comics shop imaginable, and that's mainly due to their commitment to graphic novels, independent mini comics and manga. It's impossible to leave empty handed with the stunning range that is packed into the two floors here. For those seeking an education in all that comics can offer, there is no finer destination.<br><strong>Alex Ingram</strong></p> <h2>Judd Street Books, Bloomsbury<br>82 Marchmont Street, WC1N 1AG<br>020 7387 5333</h2> <p>It's a wonderful jumble of remainders and new books at cheap prices, with an emphasis on Literature and the Arts. There's a large range of 'Bloomsbury' or Bloomsbury-inspired books, due to its position, plus a loads of criticism, and it's always really high quality stuff. I used to live above it, and it was responsible for a large proportion of my student debt (despite the student discounts!).<br><strong>Clare Crawford</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.londonreviewbookshop.co.uk/\">London Review Bookshop, Bloomsbury</a><br>14 Bury Place, WC1A 2JL<br>020 7269 9030</h2> <p>Why?<br>1. The stock - superbly well-selected, and in superb condition.<br>2. The staff - highly knowledgeable, very helpful, and actually care about both their stock and their customers.<br>3. The ambience - this is a bookshop you actually want to spend a long time browsing in.<br>4. The events - no John Grisham signings, but real discussions and readings that always engage with interested readers.<br>I always leave having bought more than I intended, and I always find books I didn't even know I wanted, but then again, isn't that the point of a good bookshop? Long may they continue ...<br><strong>Robert Kingsbury-Barker</strong></p> <p>The LRB bookshop stocks the widest imaginable range of books (general interest and scholarly) within a space that is easy to navigate. The staff know what they are selling and are able to guide their customers. This bookshop functions also as a forum for literary presentations and intellectual exchanges through a series of readings and lectures. It offersan electronic newsletter of events and new books arranged by theme. Occasional wine/nibbles evenings are combined with 10% discounts on purchases.<br><strong>I Sinanoglou</strong></p> <p>In order of remembrance: No tinned music. Elegant shelves and tables. Intellectually inspiring books on display. No blockbusters on display, or on the shelves. Breadth of selection. Comfortable chair, usually empty. Intelligent-looking staff who smile indulgently if boyfriend pretends to be crazy in attempt to embarrass me out of the shop, all the books I needed for my masters in literature, nice mugs. Not too cold or too hot. Interesting literary soirees. Great associations (with literary mag). Survived the filming of the mangled interpretation of McEwan's 'Enduring Love'. Didn't give job of manager to former Tesco employee. A metropolitan beacon.<br><strong>Sarah Jenkins</strong></p> <h2>Books for Amnesty International, Camden<br>241 Eversholt Street, NW1 1BE<br>020 7388 0070</h2> <p>A great secondhand shop with a huge fiction selection in the basement, plus a very good stock of travel titles, art books, childrens' books, etc. I always end up leaving with a bag full of books, the prices are so convenient and things are easy to find. Staff are friendly, too. This shop used to be in Camden HighStreet but a while ago moved to new premises behind Mornington Crescent tube station. A must for all booklovers! And of course it's all for a good cause.<br><strong>Angela Groot</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.citikey.com/business/10151823/\">Black Gull Books, Camden</a><br>70-71 Camden Lock Place, Camden Lock Market, NW1 8AF<br>020 7267 5005</h2> <p>It's what a great bookshop is meant to be - untidy, adorable, musty, with academic, befuddling assistants, I'm unable not to buy something whenever I'm in there. The area is of course a key attraction: Camden Lock Market, next door to renowned jeweller Roger Stone and world famous games and puzzles specialist Village Games. They have (mainly) almost mint condition books at a fraction of the retail price, and a witty (and gorgeous) sales assistant to inform you on what you're buying. Fantastic!<br><strong>Annabel Bathke</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/\">Foyles, Charing Cross</a><br>113-119 Charing Cross Road, WC2H 0EB<br>020 7437 5660</h2> <p>For more than 100 years, Foyles has enjoyed legendary stature as Britain's biggest independent bookshop. But under the eccentric rule of Christina Foyle, Foyles was ramshackle and consumer-unfriendly. \"Foyled again?\" mocked a sign in the window of a nearby competitor. No longer. These days people browse for hours in Foyles for pleasure, and not because they can't find what they're looking for among the 1.4m books on its five floors of shelves. It even has its own website. Foyles has also provided a home to treasured independent retailers made homeless by soaring rents, Ray's Jazz Shop and Silver Moon women's bookshop.<br><strong>Jon Dennis</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.johnsandoe.com/\">John Sandoe Books, Chelsea</a><br>10 Blacklands Terrace, SW3 2SR<br>020 7589 9473</h2> <p>This is my favourite bookshop in London, and it's independent credentials burn all the brighter for being right next door to the bland corporatism that is today's King's Road. It has a secondhand bookshop feel, without the funny smell, and the staff are supremely helpful and seemingly always better read than you. There's a good selection of imported US books (including Dave Eggers' McSweeney's journal) and a selection from most genres/subjects which, given the shop's size, is something of a miracle. Clambering up the little spiral staircase reveals another aladdin's cave upstairs, with a sort of concertina shelving system, so that they can shoehorn in a few more books. T'riffic.<br><strong>Daniel Carey</strong></p> <p>A prince among booksellers. The stock is intelligently and seductively presented, service is prompt and courteous, the staff erudite yet free of Mitfordesque snobberies. A invaluable resource for the professional writer, a treasure trove for the present-seeker, a paradise for the browser. And the bags are classy, too.<br><strong>James Owen</strong></p> <p>I went there for the first time in the same week as the shop was profiled in the Guardian's G2 piece. I've been trying to track down novels by David Storey (vastly under-rated) and they had four in stock. I only managed to find one of these myself as they were stored in different places, but the chap in the shop had no hesitation in taking me straight to the others. The shop is cramped but the selection of titles is excellent.<br><strong>Robert Hollier</strong></p> <p>Is there any competition? Forget the beautiful location, and the beauty of the shop itself - it is truly a wondrous thing to spend time with only the best of books in print. No wading through piles of what is fashionable or sold by the yard here. The texts are impeccable selected and the staff deftly steer you to what you need. I cannot number all the new works and ideas I've been introduced to in those narrow walls. As a poorly read undergraduate I used to be dazzled by this generosity; I now owe much of my career and many friendships to it.<br><strong>Navraj Singh Ghaleigh</strong></p> <h2>World's End bookshop, Chelsea<br>357 King's Road, SW3 5ES<br>020 7352 9376</h2> <p>I thoroughly recommend the World's End Bookshop to all readers - particularly those searching for second-hand contemporary and classic novels. It is a great place to browse, with a really diverse selection of books, many of them review copies which have not even been opened. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the sales staff knowledgeable. Visit on a Sunday or Monday when there are big discounts.<br><strong>M Woolf</strong></p> <h2>Financial World Bookshop, City of London<br>90 Bishopsgate, EC2N 4DQ<br>020 7444 7118</h2> <p>I would like to nominate this great shop in the City of London (near Liverpool St station). It may not be of interest to the general bookworm who know their Auster from their elbow, but for those of us who need to keep up with new ideas and writing on finance, this place is a godsend. A most friendly atmosphere (probably something to do with the nice staff) and a really varied array of books on all the main subjects as well as good general finance reads.<br><strong>Laurie Donaldson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.bertramrota.co.uk/\">Bertram Rota, Covent Garden</a><br>31 Long Acre, WC2E 9LT<br>020 7836 0723</h2> <p>Most people walking down Long Acre don't look up at the elegant facades above the chain store windows. They should - through an anonymous door and up a dark stairwell at Number 31 waits the bibliophile's mecca. I come here to escape crowds and consumerism, browsing first editions by favourites like Nabokov or Robert Lowell. The shelves display a wonderful assortment of literature, private press and illustrated books, far too much to see in a single visit.<br><strong>Mark Walton</strong></p> <h2>Offstage and Treadwell's, Covent Garden<br>34 Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, WC2E 7PB<br>020 7240 3883</h2> <p>These two bookshops-in-one are a great find in the heart of Covent Garden. Upstairs, Treadwells is full of mysterious books about magic, myth and belief amid incense and even magic wands! There's also a lovely sofa to relax on while you read and think. Downstairs is Offstage Bookshop (which recently moved from premises on Chalk Farm Road): a mecca for actors and drama students. Offstage stocks film and play scripts and every time I've been there I've never failed to find a gem of a title. It's the most original and friendly bookshop in London!<br><strong>Polly Barker</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.booksellercrow.com/\">The Bookseller, Crystal Palace</a><br>50 Westow Street, Crow on the Hill, SE19 3AF<br>020 8771 8831</h2> <p>An absolute jewel of an independent that satisfies the most catholic and adventurous tastes, crammed to the rafters with poetry, classics, screenplays, art, black interest, essays, travel, some hippy stuff, a fantastic children's section that caters for those cutting first teeth right through to those cutting apron strings, loads of biographies of people that aren't cricketers (although they have those too), and an amazing range of old and new fiction (the shop has the particular and rare distinction of stocking some stunningly good US-only titles, which are stealth bombed in at regular intervals). The Bookseller Crow is the fast-beating cultural heart of Crystal Palace, and Jon Main, Justine Crow and Joy Haney are the knowledgeable and accommodating trio that stoke its ventricles with such unflagging zeal. And Jon once went to a party with Raymond Carver. Say no more.<br><strong>Paul Morley</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.renaissance-books-uk.co.uk/\">Renaissance Books, Crystal Palace</a><br>28-30 Church Rd, SE19 2ET<br>020 8653 1884</h2> <p>I can't recommend Renaissance Books enough as a friendly place to browse for hours, turning up unexpected delights ranging from the psychology of drugs to obscure musical tomes. Their philosophy section is huge and carefully chosen and they can turn up almost anything for you if you ask. They have some charmingly quirky areas of expertise - fairy tales and textiles spring to mind - and their poetry and fiction sections are equally impressive. A small but perfectly formed bookworm's refuge.<br><strong>Alice Ross</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://dulwichbookshop.tbpcontrol.co.uk/tbp.web/customeraccesscontrol/home.aspx?d=dulwichbookshop&amp;s=C&amp;r=10000132&amp;ui=0&amp;bc=0\">Dulwich Books, Dulwich</a><br>6 Croxted Road, SE21 8SW<br>020 8670 1920</h2> <p>For a small community to be served by one bookshop is great, to have two is unbelievable. But Dulwich is so blessed, and for me Dulwich Books on Croxted Road is the place to go. A good selection of books, great staff and a first class order service means that you don't need to go anywhere else for all your book needs. Plus they often have fantastic art on the walls.<br><strong>Peter Harrison</strong></p> <h2>The Bookshop, Dulwich Village<br>1d Calton Avenue, SE21 7DE<br>020 8693 2808</h2> <p>I am a local resident and longstanding customer of Hazel Broadfoot's and Julian Toland's superb bookshop in the heart of Dulwich Village. The standard of shopfitting, the range of stock relative to the size of the shop, the helpfulness and knowledge of the staff, overall shop atmosphere, buying judgment, customer service and new initiatives are all outstanding in this marvellous enterprise. I find it much better to use than one of the chain bookstores in the centre of London. It is rare for me not to be able to obtain exactly what I want straight away or very soon afterwards. The staff are unfailingly kind and well-informed. Their advice is always relevant and lucidly expressed. The Bookshop is open seven days a week and is always full of potential customers and school children. It has become a centre of cultural excellence in my part of south London; I find myself drawn to it magnetically every weekend.<br><strong>Anthony Lester</strong></p> <p>Well-informed and efficient service by people who read books and are in touch with the publishing world and local authors, and who like to run their own little bit of the book world. Why shouldn't they be able to indulge in their interest and benefit their customers?<br><strong>Ian Mitchell</strong></p> <p>To live near any bookshop is a pleasure. To be a close neighbour of The Bookshop is a privilege. Julian and Hazel seem to read nearly everything. They give us capsule reviews at the desk, and time permitting, will willingly go into more detail. They will not only get most orders in within two days, they have got to know our individual tastes. So when I asked Hazel for something \"a bit dark and unpleasant, but not TOO horrible,\" for myself, she was able tocomply (Janet Evanovich in this case). Large chains can offer lower prices; they can't get to know you like a friend.<br><strong>Stephanie Calman</strong></p> <p>My local bookshop is as important as my local pub, and when I moved a mile and a half up the road from East Dulwich to Dulwich I comforted myself with the fact that my old local bookshop would still be within walking distance. Then I discovered The Bookshop, which was like upgrading pubs from one with great beer and great food to one with great beer, great food and an inglenook with a roaring fire. Don't be put off by its diminutive size - it's like a TARDIS, and there's a far greater choice of books on display than the laws of physics should really allow. If it's not on the shelf, all the staff seem to be trained in the art of finding exactly what you want on the computer and then having it there the next day. And if by some chance it's not quite what you wanted, you don't have to have it. Perfect. Improvements? Well, they could start serving beer as well as books...<br><strong>Ian Harrison</strong></p> <p>1. The staff are always friendly and helpful.<br>2. Excellent service - I order a book one day and it is available the next.<br>3. They are always able to give helpful suggestions whether it is a book for Granny, teenager or middle-aged academic.<br>4. Displays are up-to-date. The bookshop partakes in community activities including literary events.<br>5. It is small and manageable - no vast escalators - and yet has an excellent range of stock on all subjects.<br><strong>Vee Gilliard</strong></p> <p>This is the best bookshop I know. A small shop, packed with stock, it is run by helpful and knowledgeable staff, who obviously enjoy reading, and are willing and able to advise customers. Orders arrive within 24 hours. Book selection for children is particularly good. All my Christmas presents for those awkward teenage nephews and godsons were quickly solved.<br><strong>Emma Russell</strong></p> <p>This bookshop combines the intimacy of a village store with a considerable topical range (children's books, novels, history/biography, humour, art/architecture, photography). The staff are friendly and always willing to check on the availability of books that are not in stock; orders are often filled within 24 hours and customers are phoned as soon as a book arrives.<br><strong>I Sinanoglou</strong></p> <p>My favourite bookshop in the UK. All the staff have a real enthusiasm for books, are always willing to advise and help, never patronise and even welcome my dog. What more could anyone ask? On top of this they are open on Sundays which is the best day for browsing leisurely along the shelve.<br><strong>Vicky Carnegy</strong></p> <p>They know about books and can discuss them, and when you order them they arrive quicker than you can say Amazon. They don't move the sections around each month at the behest of some marketing spiv. Bestsellers are not in your face but must compete with all titles. They also encourage kids to read the stock before buying, have wine at Christmas and are family-run. The have become part of the community and that makes the actual buying of the book part of the enjoyment.<br><strong>Harvey Edgington</strong></p> <p>I have been an enthusiastic supporter for many years. Why? Because the staff members are so knowledgeable, in detail, in every area I have interests in - poetry, current novels, travel - and generally have exactly what I want in stock. If not, their ordering system brings the needed book in a couple of days or so after my enquiry, heralded by a phone call that it has arrived. A lovely place to visit, to linger in, sampling and perhaps buying anything from the latest Gruffalo story to the most recently updated Rough Guide on Corsica. In 2000 they received the Best Independent Bookseller Award, and from there have gone on from strength to strength<br><strong>David Nash</strong></p> <p>I use The Bookshop for all my requirements. They will always obtain a book very quickly, saving me the trouble of trying to locate it online. They have a wonderful children's section. Importantly for me, they never patronise me, a rare thing in some small bookshops which can intimidate with their highbrow atmosphere.<br><strong>Fay Stirling</strong></p> <p>Everyone there is enthusiastic and friendly. They really know about books, and they display them so enticingly that it is hard to walk past! They are expert at looking up obscure publications, and efficient at getting most things in the very next day. Couldn't be better.<br><strong>Margaret Hanton</strong></p> <p>The bookshop is packed with interesting books, I have rarely gone there and not found the book I wanted, and then another one that has taken my fancy. Any book can be ordered and it often appears the next day. The bookshop's great strength is the knowledge of its staff; I have gone in with a book half-remembered from a review and found the staff patient and well read as they trawl they memories to find the book. Once a month or so there is a talk held either at the bookshop or the nearby Dulwich Picture galley.<br><strong>Duncan Hibberd</strong></p> <p>A great little bookshop. The staff are excellent with a wide range knowledge. Every corner of its floors are crammed full of reading treasures. Often they order in my special requests with no trouble but great speed.<br><strong>Patrick</strong></p> <h2>Two Jays Bookshop, Edgware<br>119 High Street, HA8 7DB<br>020 8952 1349</h2> <p>Books upon books upon books. Struggle through the piles and you will be rewarded. Lots to delight, and regulars get a discount.<br><strong>David Marcus</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.newbeaconbooks.co.uk/\">New Beacon Books, Finsbury Park</a><br>76 Stroud Green Road, Finsbury Park, N4 3EN<br>020 7272 4889</h2> <p>I visit this shop once a year and it never changes. New Beacon deals with titles from the African American/Caribbean/Black British/African communities, has been there for as long as I can remember (I'm in my 40s) and still wears the same tatty appearance. Too many posters and leaflets for events long past are pinned to the notice board; books falling over each other clutter the shelves. But despite being rough around the edges, it is welcoming, cosy and unpretentious. It stocks titles you wouldn't find in WH Smiths or Ottakar's; and even if they don't have what you want, they'll go out of their way to get it for you. The assistant, Janet, knows her books, and is great at recommending new or old titles. New Beacon Books is a well-known shop: I hope it remains so.<br><strong>Maggie Whittaker</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1278/3011.php\">Nomad Books, Fulham</a><br>781 Fulham Road, SW6 5HA<br>020 7736 4000</h2> <p>This is a local bookshop in the true sense. I love going in there: the welcome is always warm and a cup of coffee from the cafe is delicious. As it's not a chain, Nomad don't have huge sections of categories, but any title they don't carry can be ordered; often, I've collected books the next day. Having said that, the selection they do have more often than not hits the spot. I love it!<br><strong>Rosemary Wright</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.thepanbookshop.blogspot.com/\">The Pan Bookshop, Fulham</a><br>158 Fulham Road, SW10 9PR<br>020 7373 4997</h2> <p>It's only when I go to this beautiful little bookshop, with its crowded tables and heaving shelves, that I realise just how stilted one's choice is in that larger chain bookshops. The books are clearly lovingly - and somewhat eclectically - chosen, with the philosophy, science and cooking sections being particularly worthy of note. There is an atmosphere of care and attention for books and a relish for books for their own sake that does away with the commercial atmosphere so often found in chain and even independent bookshops, and it's this that makes the real book lovers walk away with bulging bags. The children's section is without a doubt the best in London.<br><strong>Emily Sophie</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.broadwaybookshophackney.com/\">The Broadway Bookshop, Hackney</a><br>6, Broadway Market, Hackney, E8 4QJ<br>020 7241 1626</h2> <p>Brilliant to have a local good independent bookshop in east London.<br><strong>Rachel King</strong></p> <p>What utter joy to finally have a bookshop in the area. A new venture, but friendly and offering an excellentservice on ordering books. Here's to a long and successful existence.<br><strong>Amanda Kendal</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.welbooks.co.uk/\">West End Lane Books, Hampstead</a><br>277 West End Lane, NW6 1QS<br>020 7431 7655</h2> <p>This is a long, narrow bookshop, with books on all subjects clearly displayed in beautiful, real wood cases; there's a children's section at the back. The atmosphere is both casual and professional, and the staff are always ready with information, general help, or to have a chat about a book - they are knowledgeable about their stock, interesting to talk to. They run a monthly reading group, too. All that's missing is a sofa and a cup of coffee to aid the browsing - what a pity there isn't space for that.<br><strong>Patricia Isaacs</strong></p> <p>The Camden Times put it well: \"size is not everything and, like a sonnet or a haiku, West End Lane Books offers a selective and deeply satisfying experience with what Henry James might have called 'deep breathing economy\". Doris Lessing, among others, has made appearances here, the staff are booklovers and, with their manager Graeme Estry, choose the stock to ensure a high quality selection.<br><strong>Rosie Teasdale</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.talesonmoonlane.co.uk/\">Tales On Moon Lane, Herne Hill</a><br>25 Half Moon Lane, SE24 9JW<br>020 7274 5759</h2> <p>A wonderful children's bookshop. The owner, Tamara Macfarlane, manages to create an exciting and free atmosphere for children and parents. It has a caring, enthusiastic and knowledgeable young staff and sells the best children's books, new and old. You enter a world of magic and mystery and drama where children feel free to play, hear stories and stretch their imaginations. Tales on Moon Lane is unique and a frontrunner for the best independent bookshop award without a doubt.<br><strong>Roger Smith</strong></p> <p>A place where Alice would have found her Wonderland and then chosen a book to read. Folk gather here to enjoy books whether they are three or 93. Tamara Linke, owner and former teacher, granddaughter of Christabel Burniston, President of the English Speaking Board International, continues the family tradition in oral communication. Children deserve to meet storytellers, for through stories they become treasure-seekers. Lively, twice-weekly storytelling sessions take place where everyone is welcomed and minds are opened. A recent half-term Children's Literature Festival was a great success.<br><strong>Pauline Lyons</strong></p> <p>Stocks an excellent range of children's literature, and also imaginative, reasonably priced gifts and cards. The window displays are a delight - the Narnia one was my particular favourite: to walk down Half Moon Lane in the half light of a winter's afternoon and see this display was to be transported to a world of magic. I thought any shop with a window that could do that, was worth exploring, and I was not disappointed. The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Browsing or buying, this is a treat of a shop.<br><strong>Dawn Kozoboli</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.rippingyarns.co.uk/\">Ripping Yarns, Highgate</a><br>355 Archway Road, N6 4EJ<br>020 8341 6111</h2> <p>A second-hand bookshop largely devoted to old children's fiction: 1950s Blyton, Blue Peter annuals, 30s adventure tales. But an excellent selection of old Penguins, too, and 100-year-old editions of Sterne and the like. Scribbled-over editions of Beatrix Potter. Cloth maps of Snowdonia. Gorgeous.<br><strong>Ros Taylor</strong></p> <p>The staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, and extremely efficient at getting books in if you request them. There is a solid selection of classics etc, plus plenty more eclectic items including an enchanting selection of children's books and annuals. A diamond in the rough of the Archway Road!<br><strong>Guy Abrahams</strong></p> <p>A bookshop in which you can happily spend half a day unearthing forgotten childhood favourites, reliving your misspent youth, and browsing the large stock of new and secondhand books. The staff is young, always helpful and will look out for books you dimly remember reading when your were six, but can't remember the title of (something about an elephant and a scarecrow ... ). The owner, Celia Mitchell, is as knowledgeable and enthusiastic as anyone could hope for. You're certain to leave Ripping Yarns triumphantly loaded with books you never knew you wanted.<br><strong>Cicely Herbert</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.holbornbooks.co.uk/pages/home.htm\">Holborn Books, Holborn</a><br>17 Sicilian Avenue, WC1A 2QH<br>020 7831 0022</h2> <p>They're the best supplier of computer text books and know a bit about what they are selling. Much better quality than Waterstones. They even sell SuSE Linux, my favourite system.<br><strong>Ian Bruntlett</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/\">Persephone Books Ltd</a><br>59 Lamb's Conduit Street, Holborn, WC1N 3NB<br>020 7242 9292</h2> <p>A true gem. The official shop of the independent womens' publishers, it is a joy to visit. From the bell that tinkles when you enter, to the stripped wooden floors, to the walls piled high with the beautiful dove-grey Persephone books (all with bookmarks to match the individual endpapers), and the knowledgeable and friendly staff. The atmosphere is conducive to spending the whole afternoon in there, perched on a low chair. They also sell a few non-Persephone books, alongside their own mugs,clothes, cards etc.<br><strong>Jane Mornement</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1278/3138.php\">The Owl Bookshop, Kentish Town</a><br>209 Kentish Town Road, NW5 2JU<br>020 7485 7793</h2> <p>My favourite bookstore. An independent that always manages to have very good offers. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful, but not at all intrusive; if they don't have a book in stock, they can order it for you. It's a beautiful bookshop that looks exactly like bookshops looked when I was a child: old, clean, bright and covered with books in wall-to-wall dark wood shelves (leave the blond wood for All Bar One!) without the obstruction of novelty crap. The children's section is very good. They also stock a small selection of DVDs and magazines, and organise very interesting literary events from time to time.<br><strong>Consuela</strong></p> <h2>Kew Bookshop, Kew<br>1 -2 Station Approach, TW9 3QB<br>020 8940 0030</h2> <p>The best thing about Kew is the small but intellectually robust bookshop outside the Station. The selection is hot-off-the-press and sizzling with the enthusiasm of the staff. And backlist books aren't shunted off into the publishers' graveyard; if they're good reads, quirky histories, beautifully bound unusual editions, you'll find them here under the 'Staff Recommendations' section. The evening literary parties are fun; despite hosting luminaries such as Kate Adie and Robert McFarlane, they are unpretentious and provide a real chance to interrogate the author about their work. A respite from the homogenous chains.<br><strong>Sarah Jenkins</strong></p> <h2>The Kilburn Bookshop, Kilburn<br>8 Kilburn Bridge, Kilburn High Road, NW6 6HT<br>020 7328 7071</h2> <p>Situated where Kilburn starts to worry about being tidy and well-behaved enough for its smarter cousin, Maida Vale, Kilburn Bookshop is a total joy for all lovers of books and good conversation. It's small on the outside but Tardis-like on the inside: within is an impressive variety of novels, poetry, biographies, popular science, children's fiction, etc, as well as clearly identified sections of on Black, Irish and lesbian &amp; gay interest. It carries a substantial back-catalogue of fiction and the delightful staff run a very speedy book-ordering service. Staff know when to greet customers and when to keep quiet and they are a fund of sound advice, because they love books too.<br><strong>Martin Jones</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.housmans.com/\">Housmans, King's Cross</a><br>5 Caledonian Road, N1 9DX<br>020 7837 4473</h2> <p>Left wing activists can be notoriously pedantic and humourless - not to mention bearded - so one of the surprises within radical King's Cross booksellers Housmans is stumbling across the racks of gay male porn magazines at the back, next to the latest journals from Anarchism Today and Class War. This is probably (I've never asked!) a hangover from its agreeably seedy location - although the area is rapidly losing its eccentricities as the conversion of St Pancras into a Eurostar terminal approaches. Then again, it could also be a reflection of the fact that the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard began life in the room upstairs.</p> <p>Housmans itself is an Aladdin's cave of lefty/ecological/peacenik books (it also publishes Peace News and an annual Peace Diary), with a mesmerising depth and range of titles in stock. There's also a good poetry and photography selection, and, quirkily, a fully stocked stationary counter, plus a selection of tapes and videos of performance poetry and artists. Downstairs is the similarly lefty Porcupine Books, second-hand booksellers specialising in trade union and labour history. Unlike Bookmarks in Bloomsbury, Housmans in not tied to the Socialist Worker party. Recently emerging refreshed and even mildly spruced up (although reassuringly still dusty and chaotic indoors) from the building works that have enveloped the area, even a cursory browse is absorbing enough to make you miss your train.<br><strong>Matthew Tempest</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dauntbooks.co.uk/Daunts_marylebone.html\">Daunt Books, Marylebone</a><br>83 - 84 Marylebone High Street, W1U 4QW<br>020 7224 2295</h2> <p>If you are like me and have a passion for reading books set in the country in which you are on holiday, Daunt's is the place to visit. It is first and foremost a travel bookshop where the books are arranged by country. Under Greece for example, along with a enormous range of hotel and travel guides, you will find, maps, phrase books, travel writing, books on the flora and fauna, history, recipes and food guides as well as a tempting selection of coffee table books on interiors, and stunning photographs of the country housed in a beautiful shop flooded with natural light There is also a collection of modern fiction for holiday reading and the shop is run by the most helpful knowledgeable staff.<br><strong>Melody Green</strong></p> <p>Hushed yet friendly, and with a beautiful mezzanine level redolent of an old college library, Daunt Books is one of the lovelier things about the increasingly chi-chi and chained-up Marylebone High Street. And although it excels in travel books there are always other delights on display. It was the first place I spotted Franck Pavloff's little book 'Brown'.<br><strong>Dionne Griffith</strong></p> <p>There are so many secondhand shops I love, but there's also one new bookstore that really stands out - and I'm sure I'll be just one of many to sing its praises. Daunt Books on Marylebone High Street is the only place to make me want to read absolutely everything on its shelves. The front section is a fantastic bookshop in its own right - with an absolutely faultless selection of new fiction and non-fiction, and the most stupendous children's section - but the travel section at the back, over three whole floors, is simply breathtaking (gosh, so many superlatives; sorry - but it's all true!). I love the idea of arranging books - novels, poetry, history, biography, whatever - according to country; I love to go in and browse, indulging the fantasy that I could go wherever I want, and knowing that if I did, I would find the perfect travel companions on those shelves.</p> <p>A bookshop for travellers ... so it stocks travel guides, travel literature, novels set in the destination, historical works concerning the destination and so much more, all organized by country. Plus a great selection of classic and contemporary literature at the front of the shop. Finally it is one of the most beautiful shops in London - a bibliophile's delight.<br><strong>Abby Thomas </strong></p> <p>It is a ridiculously trendy location, but celeb-spotting is a side issue. The real reason to go down that road is Daunt. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff working in a beautiful building which holds an incredible range of stuff despite its diminutive size - and it's near where I work. I'd probably go there even if it was rubbish, because I'd rather support a small business than a chain. Because the service is wonderful, though, I find it difficult to stay away.<br><strong>Chris Coates</strong></p> <p>I'm a booksniffer rather than a bookworm (old books may be easier to chew on but sniffers enjoy the smell of new books). My personal nomination is Daunt Books in Marylebone High Street: well-lit; fragrant with binding glue and printing ink; so quiet, so well-stocked and pleasingly proportioned, that one is almost embarrassed to leave without (you guessed it) buying a book.<br><strong>Sally Crawford</strong></p> <p>My favourite bookshop in London. The window display is consistently excellent, and I am tempted inside on almost a daily basis to lose myself in their elegantly arranged selection of novels, travel guides and biographies. Like many people, when holidaying I like to read a book from the country I am visiting, and only Daunt Books gave me the chance to choose from two bookcases of German classics before I embarked on a recent trip to Frankfurt. Frankly, this bookshop is zehr gut :)<br><strong>Rachel Waites</strong></p> <p>So obvious to choose, so beautiful to use.<br><strong>Michael Harding</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.heywoodhill.com/\">Heywood Hill Books, Mayfair</a><br>10 Curzon Street, W1J 5HH<br>020 7629 0647</h2> <p>I think a mention of Heywood Hill Books is in order. On my last two trips to London, it has managed to have books in stock which Waterstone's would only order - and these were books in print, not used books. The staff are also very helpful and willing to chat. In one case they were waiting for a shipment of a book but they put me onto a shop in Chelsea (Sandoes) which had it in stock.<br><strong>Jeffrey A. Manley</strong></p> <h2>Children's Bookshop, Muswell Hill<br>29 Fortis Green Road, N10 3RY<br>020 8444 5500</h2> <p>I love the Children's Bookshop as much as my children do. The range is fantastic and the staff friendly and always really helpful - equally happy to give you advice or just let you browse in peace for hours! The manager, Lesley Agnew, persuades all the very best children's authors to visit the shop for signing sessions - so far this year we've met Emma Chichester Clark, Michael Rosen and Francesca Simon, this weekend we are off to meet Mick Inkpen. She also works hard arranging author events in local schools. We never leave without a good book - and a bag full of stickers and bookmarks, too.<br><strong>Andrea Reece</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.newhambooks.co.uk/\">Newham Bookshop, Newham</a><br>747 Barking Road, Newham, E13 9ER<br>020 8552 9993</h2> <p>I treasure it because it acts as a personal shopper. I describe the person and they suggest titles they may enjoy. It is a fabulous service and have never steered me wrong, introducing me and my friends and family to absolute treasures. They are also crucial to this extremely diverse and disadvantaged community, playing a central role, in partnership with the local council to promote books and reading to large sections of the community. I am so grateful they are there.<br><strong>Lyn Brown</strong></p> <p>For 27 years Newham Bookshop, just around the corner from West Ham's Boleyn Ground, has been cherished by both the local community and readers from elsewhere, who admire and appreciate the knowledge and professionalism of its booksellers. When browsing the impressively stocked shelves you will come across pre-school tots with their parents, professors who were themselves once users of the children's section, crime aficionados seeking the latest bestseller and football fans looking for signed sporting biographies. Newham events have become legendary. Monica Ali? Mallorie Blackman? Benjamin Zephaniah? Clare Short? Take your pick. A genuine treasure.<br><strong>Gilda O'Neill</strong></p> <p>Fantastic bookshop. Viv Archer and her staff are helpful, friendly, knowledgeable. Great at recommendations, superb kids' section and a wonderful atmosphere - books piled everywhere, yet Viv can lay her hand on a title in seconds. Great local events with authors. Truly serves a diverse and vibrant community. Can't speak too highly of this shop.<br><strong>Simon Mares</strong></p> <p>The bookshop began 32 years ago as a spin-off from a community education campaigning group which diversified into a provision of support and skills development services. Over the past decade, Vivienne Archer and John Newman have developed the stock to a point where it has to be one of the main features of quality of life in this amazing, vibrant, multi-racial but unfashionable community. Such is the range of bang-up-to date stock, it's hard to come away without a bag full - the quality customised bags have themselves have become collectors items! Over recent years the shop has sponsored signings and live speaking events with a range of renowned authors. There's also a reading group that's into it's third year and still going strong. And, the final indulgence: if you can't get there during the day and live on Vivienne's route home, you can ring up with any kind of bizarre request and have it delivered the next day for no extra charge. Seriously, you couldn't have dreamt up such a wonderful resource if you'd tried.<br><strong>Kevin Mansell</strong></p> <p>I don't just go to this bookshop to buy books, I hang out there. The staff have a great knowledge of the community they serve, they have respect for their community, and they are so in touch with their community that they don't presume that English will be your first language. It is a real example of a community bookshop. The kids' section offers stories from all over the world, so it doesn't matter where you come from: you will always feel at home. One day a really smart person will write a book about this bookshop and we will all live happily ever after.<br><strong>Benjamin Zephaniah</strong></p> <h2>Portobello Books, Notting Hill<br>328 Portobello Road, W10 5RU<br>020 7964 3166</h2> <p>I love Portobello Books. There's a great range, the owner is always game for a lively conversation, and afterwards you can always grab a coffee round the corner in one of the several cafes on Golborne Road, or eat at the Moroccan Tagine.<br><strong>Yusef Noden</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reviewbookshop.co.uk/contact.html\">Review, Peckham</a><br>131 Bellenden Road, SE15 4QY<br>020 7639 7400</h2> <p>Review has only been open a few months but is really plugging a hole in this part of south London. The owner, Ros, obviously loves books and loves to talk about them - she's just as happy to get a recommendation as make one. Although the stock on the shelves is small (but very well chosen for my money) she can order anything for you and in most cases you'll have it the next day. Getting a tiny discount from Amazon and then having to go and hunt for your parcel at the post office just doesn't compare. As well as fiction she stocks art books, photography books, cookery books, poetry, lovely cards, little gifts and she'll make you a nice cup of coffee too. Since I never want anything on those three for two tables anyway I don't see the point in going anywhere else now.<br><strong>Joanne Leonard</strong></p> <p>A bookshop that really believes in making its customers welcome. Although small, it has a fairly comprehensive range. It stocks some local authors, has very good stationery and cards, and sells organic coffee. It's not right on my doorstep, so I don't visit as often as I'd like, but when I do, it's always a pleasure.<br><strong>Dawn Kozoboli</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.primrosehillbooks.com/\">Primrose Hill Books, Primrose Hill</a><br>134 Regent's Park Road, NW1 8XL<br>020 7586 2022</h2> <p>This is my favourite bookshop in London; it's a small, friendly place with a great selection of both new and secondhand books. It is small, but brilliantly laid out with a big central table for rummaging for books you haven't heard of... yet. They are really into classics and new and undiscovered authors and have lots of information if you need it. You can pretty much ask for anything (out of print or not), and they'll either have it or attempt to get hold of it for you. They don't have any 3 for 2 offers on the latest bestsellers, but regularly have book signings and events for both local authors and anyone who they think has written a good book. They recommended such classics to me as The Life of Pi and The Number One Ladies Detective agency before anyone had ever heard of them.<br><strong>Libby Campbell</strong></p> <p>I love the shop and have been going there for 25 years - Jessica andMarek are enthusiasts, readers who recommend and love books. Theyproduce beautiful booklets at Christmas and in the summer, recommendingbooks and gifts. Each recommendation is personal, literate andthoughtful. The shop is a delight, full of interesting finds andclever predictions. It is one of the jewels in this area and we alllove it.<br><strong>Jonah Sullivan</strong></p> <h2>Trinity Hospice Bookshop, Putney<br>208 Upper Richmond Road, SW15 6TD<br>020 8780 0737</h2> <p>Probably not a hot contender for 'Glamorous Book Shop of the Year', but definitely one to set the heart of any serious reader aflutter. Essentially one of the Trinity Hospice secondhand stores, but one that sells only music and books - at \u00a31 a book! As if that weren't enough, if you buy two books, you get one free! The books are divided into really logical sections (fiction, biography, classics, philosophy, children's and so on), and the shelves are pleasingly tidy. Whilst I haven't ventured into the great stacks of vinyl they do look tempting (unless you've never owned a record player like me!)<br><strong>Jo Arden</strong></p> <p>One of my favourite bookshops. I first heard of it through this database, and wanted to endorse it after many months of happy reading. Buying second-hand books from a charity is splendidly ethical, plus there is the added frisson of never knowing what you're going to find in this eccentric shop. I have strayed completely from my old reading patterns, and I feel better for it. I like being part of the cycle - buying books for only about \u00a31 is great, and it's also an easy way to donate old books yourself.<br><strong>Elke</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.grantandcutler.com/\">Grant &amp; Cutler, Soho</a><br>55-57 Great Marlborough Street, London W1F 7AY<br>020 7734 2012</h2> <p>I have to nominate Grant &amp; Cutler. As a Spanish undergraduate, I have found no better bookshop for supplying me with not only my course texts but also a full range of European literature for personal reading. Fab shop, great selection of books and really well-trained, helpful and professional staff. Love it there and would recommend to anyone!<br><strong>Louise Ticehurst</strong></p> <p>My favourite independent bookshop. Not only do they have everything you would expect to find, but such is the size of their stock that they have lots of niche titles which are a bit off the beat-and-track. The staff are really helpful with lots of knowledge and experience in foreign language literature, and it's generally a nice place to browse for a good read.<br><strong>Tom Smith</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.josephsbookstore.com/\">Joseph's Bookstore, Temple Fortune</a><br>1255-57 Finchley Road, NW11 0AD<br>020 8731 7575</h2> <p>To my mind, in terms of books of Jewish interest, both fiction and non-fiction, Joseph's has no equal in the UK. Just as importantly, its stock of contemporary British literature is exemplary. It is also one of the very few independent bookshops which has a considerable range of world literature. Over the years, it has become a prominent venue for book launches and important lectures and in the true tradition of Jewish hospitality, it offers to the hungry and thirsty book-lover a wonderfully atmospheric cafe specialising in delicious Mediterranean cuisine.<br><strong>Moris Farhi</strong></p> <p>Joseph's Bookstore is not my nearest bookshop, nor is it the largest, but the reason why I sometimes cycle half-way across London to browse their shelves is because this is a bookshop that really cares about their customers and which has excelled in creating a community of booklovers. For aspiring writers, Michael Joseph, the owner of the shop, is a wonderful source of advice and information about agents and publishers. They run events that relate to a wide range of interests, have opened a cafe and everyone who works in the store is familiar with their stock and will talk through appropriate choices with their customers.<br><strong>Naomi Gryn</strong></p> <p>Everything in Michael Joseph's bookshop expresses his sensibility. The fastidious grouping of books by subject matter, grounded in Jewishness - his shop is the pride of Golders Green - but also cosmopolitan and humanistic, a gathering of good neighbours. He leavens familiar English titles with judiciously-chosen imports from America and Israel. The clapboard walls are hung with a changing display of prints and paintings you wouldn't mind owning. Each week the shelves are pushed back to make way for a stream of readings, debates and jazz. And up two steps is Michael's Cafe Also, where you can eat Turkish mezze and textured fishcakes. I warm to Joseph's Bookstore because as well as being a customer's pleasure, it seems to delight its rangy, voluble, seemingly ever-present owner and impressario.<br><strong>Michael Kustow</strong></p> <p>For me the shop is rather like Dr Who's Tardis: the exterior doesn't prepare one for the interior! The wide variety of titles available are thoughtfully chosen, always including less well-known or emerging writers; this has singlehandedly expanded my reading experience. Joseph's is a refreshing antidote to the chains that dominate most high streets - yes, they have their place, but they simply can't compete with specialist staff who seem to really care. And if I want a book that's out of stock, they always manage to find a copy for me in a very short space of time. A visit to the shop is always a positive experience.<br><strong>Gaby Morris</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wimbledonbooksandmusic.co.uk/\">Wimbledon Books and Music</a><br>40 High Street, Wimbledon, SW19 5AU<br>020 8879 3101</h2> <p>Wimbledon Village boasts a new, elegant and friendly bookshop in which browsers, as they select a book, can catch a glimpse of the local horses trotting by. Light and airy with comfortable sofas, the shop has a varied selection of interesting books including an unusually comprehensive children's section, as well as classical CDs and cards.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>11:56am:</strong> To spend or not to spend - that is the question likely to dominate the mini-rally between David Cameron and Gordon Brown at prime minister's questions today.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>11.57am: </strong>The fiscal rule that requires the government to only borrow to invest over an economic cycle and to keep debt below 40% of national income is expected to be ditched in the forthcoming pre-budget report on the grounds that we are facing 'exceptional circumstances'.</p> <p>The Conservatives have quite a lot to say about the government's plan to increase borrowing to spend its way out of an almost certain recession.</p> <p>They believe further rising debt would damage Britain's economic outlook still further and reduce the scope for interest rate cuts. So expect a bit of rough and tumble on this issue between Brown and the opposition leader.</p> <p>Brown may also have to field questions as a number of doom-laden reports are published from which the opposition parties can take their pick. </p> <p>First, the Living Planet Report by the World Wildlife Fund, which warns that we are all heading for an \"ecological credit crunch\" because our collective demands on natural resources are overreaching what the earth can sustain by almost a third. </p> <p>A report on energy by the Peak Oil group warns that falling oil production will hit the UK earlier than generally expected, and will present a greater threat than that posed by terrorism.</p> <p>Closer to home, the dangers of giant databases holding personal information are outlined by information commissioner, Richard Thomas, in light of alarming levels of data loss. The Audit Commission published a report today which claims that organizations set up to improve children's services after the death of Victoria Climbie have done little to improve things, five years after a report made a series of recommendations to that end. </p> <p>Then we have the findings of the government's spending watchdog, which criticises health services for failing to get a clear picture of alcohol problems and the services needed as a result, despite the fact that 10 million of us drink more than we should. </p> <p>One issue that is probably more likely to feature than these serious policy problems is Manuelgate. What to do about BBC presenters Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand? Should they go, after their offensive phone calls to the answering machine of actor Andrew Sachs (of Fawlty Towers fame)?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>12:02pm:</strong> Brown starts by outlining his meetings with 'colleagues and others'.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12:03pm:</strong> <strong>Adrian Bailey</strong> (Lab, West Bromwich) raises the spectre of job losses in the credit crunch.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12:04pm:</strong> What reassurances that banks will give the same support to small businesses as they themselves received from the taxpayer?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12:04pm:</strong> Brown says the government is continuing to work on improving lending, and further announcements will be made today after meetings with banks are held. We urge banks not to change the terms and charges for existing lending to small businesses in our country, he says.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>12:05pm:</strong> Cameron gets up to tell Brown to cancel his plans to increase corporation tax for small businesses if he really wants to help them. Then he challenges the prime minister to admit that recent events suggest he never did manage to abolish \"boom and bust\" - the same attack line he used last week.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12:07pm:</strong> Brown says he's not taking any advice from Cameron on the economy, as he outlines all the recent things he's done to stabilise the economy. Cameron comes back and asks him how he can deny we are in a \"bust\" period as homeowners face negative equity. On to the fiscal rules of the Labour government, which are now set to be ditched. Does he admit his fiscal rules are now dead?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12:08pm:</strong> Brown says he has met the fiscal rules in the past 10 years. Borrowing has been under 1% under Labour. It was 3% under the Tories. They broke the roof, we fixed it, he quips - to loud acclaim from his backbench colleagues.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> Cameron says the government used to borrow to invest, now it's borrowing to stop unemployment. And what about the rule not to increase debt about 40% of national income. This notion has now collapsed completely.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12:10pm:</strong> Brown cites <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/29/do2904.xml\">George Osborne, who said in an article this morning that borrowing was the wrong approach</a>, yet, says Brown, only recently the same man had said borrowing was the right approach. The Tories need to make their minds up, says Brown.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12:11pm:</strong> Cameron does a little of the broken record rule of assertiveness training as he says once again that the government can't say whether its fiscal rules are alive or dead. He asks Brown whether he believes you can spend your way out of recessions.</p> <p>Cameron then fishes out an old quote when Brown said: \"We have learnt from past mistakes. You cannot spend your way out of recession.\" So is Brown planning a spending splurge or not?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12:13pm:</strong> Brown quips that Cameron is not quoting him, but John Maynard Keynes. Brown fishes out some old Tory quotes in exchange which cite Osborne as saying borrowing is good and borrowing is not good. Cameron says obviously the new fiscal rules mean not answering the question, as he himself fails to address the inconsistencies in Tory claims that Brown has just highlighted.</p> <p>There's a lot of noise from an overexcited Tory backbench. Brown says the Tories say borrowing is the wrong approach. He disagrees. he thinks he's right and they're wrong and this is proof that the Tories are not ready for government.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12:18pm:</strong> <strong>Nick Clegg</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, says Brown doesn't distinguish between good and bad public spending, citing the costly NHS IT database and the ID database as cases in point. </p> <p>As families rethink their plans in light of the credit crunch isn't it time the government also rethinks its own plans, he asks. </p> <p>Brown says he doesn't recognise the figures Clegg has just cited, as he points out that the Lib Dems claim to be able to make \u00a320bn of savings to fund tax cuts, but have yet to identify from where.</p> <p>Clegg asks Brown why he doesn't address tax loopholes for the rich to help the worse off. Brown lists a number of measures in place to help the worse off, before telling Clegg he can't run away from the fact that the Lib Dems pledged to cut \u00a320bn of public spending at this crucial time.</p> <p>Brown says that, unlike the opposition parties, Labour is in for opportunities for all, not just for some.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12:19pm:</strong> <strong>Sir George Young</strong> (Con, Hampshire North West) gets up to raise the fact that next year parliament will only sit for 128 days, yet Brown had promised to give more power over to parliament. Isn't that a bit of a contradiction? Brown doesn't think so.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12:21pm: Philip Hollobone </strong> (Con, Kettering) asks Brown to condemn the move by the Metropolitan police's Black Police Association to urge people from black and ethnic minority communities not to join the police because of racism. Brown says the government is committed to having a more diverse police force and will look into the matter.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12:23pm:</strong> Brown is then asked a question about the military effort in Afghanistan, and the resources necessary. Brown says \u00a3700m has been earmarked to improve vehicles and buy new ones to help the military effort in Afghanistan.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12:24pm:</strong> A question about massive BP profits, at a time when many poor people are wondering how to heat their homes this winter. <strong>Robert Wareing</strong> (Lab, Liverpool West Derby) asks Brown if he can rethink a windfall tax on these energy companies. Brown says the oil price cuts must be passed on to customers to help them.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12:26pm:</strong> <strong>Andrew Robathan</strong> (Con, Blaby) asks Brown whether he would resign if his government was forced to go to the IMF for a bail-out. Brown recalls 1992, when under the Tory government the pound was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12:29pm:</strong><strong> Colin Challen </strong> (Lab, Morley and Rothwell) asks about climate change and the extra demands that imposes on the economy. He asks about a satellite programme to monitor climate change - some start to laugh at this obscure reference to an early day motion. Brown says he will look at the motion and applauds him for all the work he does to support climate change measures.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12:31pm:</strong> Brown is asked about the proposed third runway at Heathrow airport, but merely says a decision hasn't been made yet.</p> <p><strong>Sir John Butterfill</strong> (Con, Bournemouth West) raises the fact that some store cards that allow people to incur debt are linked to properties, and failure to pay the cards off - even for modest sums - leaves individuals at risk of losing their homes. Brown says he's aware of this problem and the government will look at this.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12:33pm:</strong> Independent MP <strong>Richard Taylor</strong> tells Brown he tried to call Postwatch to express his views about the closure of post offices and was mystefied to find that the body had been disbanded before consultation had finished. Brown says he will advise the MP on how he can appeal against closures.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12:36pm:</strong> <strong>Margaret Moran</strong> (Lab, Luton South) raises the spectre of repossessions. Brown tells her action has been taken to ensure courts see repossession as a last resort. He cites other measures to keep people in their homes and also provide potential new stock by buying up old houses, to point out that the government has the policy answers to the pressing problems facing Britons under the credit crunch. A good note on which to finish the session.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Instant verdict</strong></p> <p>David Cameron tried to catch the prime minister out by quoting him saying in the past that you can't spend your way out of recession, in contrast to Brown's current claims that borrowing should rise in light of the recession. But the plan backfired, since Brown had a compare-and-contrast example of his own: the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, once saying borrowing was the right approach and now saying it isn't. Deuce. The Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, missed an opportunity for more incisive questions in light of ongoing events by harking back to the misguided - in his view at least - government efforts to pour billions into a new IT system and the ID cards project. The Lib Dems have been pretty sharp on the economy, thanks in large part to the font of quite a lot of wisdom, Vincent Cable. But not today. As for Brown, he betrayed a bit of excitement when trading quotes, quips and attacks with Cameron. But the week so far has been going his way, with the poll gap between Labour and the Tories shrinking further and his call for revisions to IMF funds to help struggling countries in light of the credit crunch receiving the backing of his bon ami, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Brown is feeling in control, and it shows.</p>",

Just as importantly, the staff are extremely helpful, they know their stock and when they say: \"the book should be here on Wednesday and we'll ring you as soon as it arrives\", you know you can depend on them.<br><strong>Ron Trewellard</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.jamrecords.co.uk/\">Jam, Falmouth</a><br>32 High Street, Falmouth, Cornwall, TR11 2AD<br>01326 211722</h2> <p>I can only say that this shop has all of the ingredients of the majors but crammed in to two floors of old school high street shopping in Cornwall. Upstairs we have the folk, funk, soul, jazz, world music specialist along with her amazing coffee and to die for selection of home made cakes and biscuits as well as an impressive selection of independent cinema on DVD. Some books make it upstairs but we are mainly gifted with your creative, arty Phaidon style books which guide us to the stairs...where we have the book emporium, everything from Curious Incident to Amelia's Magazine. Jam mainly specialises in niche publications from comic strips through to graphic novels and there are tons of homemade books from the vast quantity of art students who live in Falmouth. This is more a gallery than book shop except the one common factor is that you keep turning pages.<br><strong>Adam Robertson</strong></p> <h2>The Crediton Bookshop, Crediton<br>100 High Street, Crediton, Devon, EX17<br>01363 774740</h2> <p>As an expatriate of 35 years, I must say that this is one of the best bookshops that I know - for the personal touch it compares with The Travel Bookshop in Marylebone High Street as it was 15 years ago. A surprising find where least expected. It is owned and run by people who love books.<br><strong>Gail Mck</strong></p> <p>I am lucky enough to live near a small town which has a thriving bookshop. It is small and cosy with a helpful owner (there used to be a dog at times, too) who will try her best and use her considerable imagination and experience to find what you are looking for if she hasn't got it. She supplies books for the courses I teach and the bookgroup I belong to - always offering a discount if possible. I can hardly go in there without buying something or at least having a good browse. She also supports good causes with petitions and the like.<br><strong>Nancy Dowling</strong></p> <h2>Bath Old Books, Bath<br>9C Margarets Buildings, Bath, Somerset, BA1 2LP<br>01225 422244</h2> <p>My annual booksearch experience in the UK always involves a stop at Bath Old Books. The owner, Steven Ferdinando, keeps a fine and orderly stock and his knowledge of wide-ranging titles is a true reward for the traveller. Sadly, the number of booksellers in Bath is dwindling, but I hope to pop in to Bath Old Books for many years to come.<br><strong>Douglas E Slowiak (Arizona)</strong></p> <h2>Bridgwater Bookshop, Bridgwater<br>34 High Street, Bridqwater, Somerset, TA6 3BL<br>01278 457458</h2> <p>I love this bookshop because of its warm and friendly atmosphere - it's hard to pass by without popping in to browse. Once inside I always find a title to catch my interest: I have an eclectic taste and this shop always offers something new and tempting. The staff add to the pleasure by greeting me in a friendly way, and are always ready to help with any queries I may have. It is a jewel in the crown of our small town and provides an oasis for the area's literati.<br><strong>Sue Cann</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.baileyhillbookshop.co.uk/\">Bailey Hill Bookshop, Castle Cary</a><br>Fore Street, Castle Cary, Somerset, BA7 7BG<br>01963 350917</h2> <p>Bailey Hill Bookshop has it all: friendly welcome, reassuring atmosphere, quietly efficient service, and personal attention to orders large or small. Want to give a book to please and impress the children or grandchildren? Read a review and forgotten the title? Want to know more about Italy, Incas or Imagists? Bailey Hill will never let you down. The stock is always up-to-date and invitingly displayed. Every visit provides something unexpected and irresistible: biography, current affairs, good fiction, history, CDs, DVDs, quality second-hand books ... it's all there. Bailey Hill has a sister shop in Wells (West Side Bookshop) which is every bit as good, but sadly is to close shortly, following the arrival of Ottakers in Wells last year.<br><strong>John Warne</strong></p> <h2>Shakespeare &amp; Hall, Dunster<br>1, High Street, Dunster, Somerset TA24 6SF<br>01643 821469</h2> <p>I first came across this bookshop two years ago, just after having been bowled over by Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. They happened to have two of his other books for five pounds. These days, I no longer go to browse, but ask the owner for a recommendation; I always leave with at least four books written by people I have barely heard of. I live in Edinburgh but return to Somerset to buy my books from this shop. Its selection of fiction is simply incredible. The owner has read most of the stock and has a knack of knowing what you need before you do.<br><strong>Tom Pilcher</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.speakingtree.co.uk/CourtyardBooks.html\">Courtyard Books, Glastonbury</a><br>2-4 High St, Glastonbury, Somerset, BA6 9DU<br>01458 835050</h2> <p>A great bookshop full of the sort of new age and occult books you'd expect to find in Glastonbury, with books of local interest, titles by local authors and a good general stock too. Friendly knowledgeable staff, good prices, not at all gloomy or dusty! They pay good prices for books too if you've got a collection that fits with their speciality.<br><strong>Vicki Purple</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.labyrinthbooks.co.uk/\">Labyrinth Books, Glastonbury</a><br>Vestry Hall, High Street, Glastonbury, Somerset, BA6 9DU<br>01458 830831</h2> <p>This is my favourite bookshop, because it has a mixture of new and secondhand. It seems to be the only bookshop that will sell you Aleister Crowley, Kenneth Grant, Austin Spare - and thousands of other rare books. Very aware staff, and a very welcoming atmosphere.<br><strong>David Walker</strong></p> <h2>Pennies from Heaven, Corsham<br>9B Station Road, Corsham, Wiltshire, SN15 9EU<br>01249 715555</h2> <p>An amazing bookshop and gallery tucked away in a charming corner of Corsham. The shining red paint and imposing Gill Sans logo just draw you in - and 'draw' is the right word! They are a specialist art and design bookshop, with seemingly thousands of titles from all over the world - most of which I have never seen before. Every subject is covered, from painting to sculpture, architecture to cinema. Relax on the large sofa, coffee in hand and book open, and admire the current exhibitions by local artists, sculptors and photographers, (changed about once a month, so repeat visits are always worthwhile). Warm, friendly and family run - what more do you need? Maybe one of the excellent sketchbooks on the way out? 10 out of 10.<br><strong>James Alexander</strong></p> <h2>Devizes Books, Devizes<br>Handel House, Sidmouth Street, Devizes, Wiltshire, SN10 1LD<br>01380 725944</h2> <p>A wonderful combination of a diverse and interesting bookshop and a rapid book-ordering centre. Situated in the historic Handel's House, it provides an array of books from local history to international travel. Children are also catered for in a den of books of differing difficulty, size and price. Should you require a book they do not have in stock, they will willingly search for it, or even chase a snippet of information to provide you with what you want. Deliveryis often the next day. Recently, searching for a present for a well-read friend, I was guided to a variety of books by helpful ssistants, each vying to capture the very essence of my requirements. This is what all bookshops should be like and shows how good a small independent can be.<br><strong>David Baker</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wellwisher.biz/\">The Well Wisher Bookshop, Devizes</a><br>51 Long Street, Devizes, Wiltshire, SN10 1NP<br>01380 722 640</h2> <p>The Well Wisher is a specialist children's bookshop with an extensive stock. There is a warm welcome for anyone visiting the shop, not just regulars. Advice and assistance are always available if wanted. On the sad occasions when you don't have time to browse you can just give the age, sex, reading ability and interests of the child and the owner, Karen, comes up with a selection. The difficulty then is choosing just one. For Christmas you can email her and she will compile a list of suitable books. A lifesaver when you run out of time. They also provide a comprehensive range for services to schools. This is how a bookshop should be.<br><strong>Jane Tuckwell</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ellwoodbooks.com/\">Ellwood Books, Salisbury</a><br>38 Winchester Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP1 1HG<br>01722 322975</h2> <p>Very friendly and attractive rare and secondhand bookshop in the centre of Salisbury, just off the market square. A light and tidy bookshop, four rooms with clean pine shelves and plenty of space to browse. Two dogs keep the helpful owner company (the younger one attracts customers by being part of the window display!). There is a wide range of books - with over 10,000 titles in stock - ranging in date from 1600 to 2006. Specialities include poetry, religion and local interest titles (there is a range of new local books in stock). With fountains, Buddhas and classical music plus comfortable chairs in each room, you can lose yourself here for hours.<br><strong>Dave Newman</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.sarumcollegebookshop.co.uk/\">Sarum College Bookshop, Salisbury</a><br>19 The Close, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP1 2EE<br>01722 326899</h2> <p>You wouldn't expect there to be a bookshop in this elegant 17th-century house opposite Salisbury Cathedral - but there is. It's part of Sarum College, an independent education and conference centre, in what was the Salisbury Theological College (mentioned in Jude the Obscure). The stock is predominantly theology, philosophy and spirituality, but there's a very healthy section on politics, social issues, as well as the best poetry selection in town. The shop is bright and airy, and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable. Downstairs there's a good secondhand section. They do mail order and can order anything not in stock very efficiently.<br><strong>Cardew Marland</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dorsetrarebooks.co.uk/\">Water Lane Bookshop, Salisbury</a><br>24 Water Lane, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP2 7TE<br>01722 337929</h2> <p>At Water Lane Bookshop you are hemmed in by books on all sides. There isn't much room to turn round, but that - along with the resident dog which snuffles around browsers' feet - is the secret of the shop's charm. Water Lane deals exclusively in second-hand books, from a good selection of paperback classics frequently at charity-shop prices, to quality hardback editions and rare/antiquarian books. As well as the usual topics there are more outr\u00e9 sections, including the occult, topography and local history. And there's an excellent website.<br><strong>Sam Blake</strong></p> <p>The Water Lane Bookshop is one of the best book shops in the South West; it has books that one would actually want to buy, rather than the tired old stock one often finds, and this, combined with the relaxed and informal atmosphere of an old-fashioned shop, makes for a great browsing experience - I rarely come away empty handed. There is a great mix of books, usually reasonably priced too; antiquarian and leather-bound books in the front room, lots of art books and numerous good value paperbacks on the top floor.<br><strong>Peter Sallis</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.peterrhodesbooks.com/\">Peter Rhodes Bookshop, Southampton</a><br>21 Portswood Road, Southampton, SO17 2ES<br>023 8039 9003</h2> <p>Excellent bookshop with a cafe in the front room. Wide selection of books, antiquarian and secondhand, costing from 50p up to hundreds of pounds. It specialises in photography but holds a large and varied stock, including many leatherbound volumes. The staff are extremely knowledgeable. Mr Rhodes goes out of his way to assist customers with their enquiries - a friendly owner who makes a fine cappuccino. Excellent music in the background. The shop also hosts poetry evenings, etc, and is now the only antiquarian bookshop in Southampton. Well worth a visit.<br><strong>Marc Harrison</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.octoberbooks.org/\">October Books, Southampton</a><br>243 Portswood Road, Portswood, Southampton, SO17 2NG<br>023 8058 1030</h2> <p>As the name suggests, this shop has grown out of the old 'left bookshop', but is now a cooperatively-based mainstream bookseller with interesting lines, helpful staff, community noticeboards, a superb ordering system and sundry spinoffs such as fairtrade products and cards. It's also next to the library, and the children can go there to spend pocket money. Having it just round the corner is fantastic.<br><strong>Jane Warren </strong></p>",
  "<p>For weeks now, financial meltdown and deepening recession notwithstanding, British journalists here have been forced to chase down EC officials and bombard them with the latest \"news\" from London about the former EU trade commissioner and his social acquaintance, Oleg Deripaska.</p> <p>Few, if any, facts have emerged. But that's hardly surprising because knowledge in UK political and journalistic circles about how the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/europe\">EU</a> works is more akin to pig ignorance. You often have to shake your head in disbelief that it is more than 35 years since Britain joined the club.</p> <p>It matters not a jot how many times you explain that the \"133 committee\" of government and EC officials effectively decides on anti-dumping and trade issues. It's still falsely asserted that the now-ennobled Mandelson removed or cut duties/tariffs on Deripaska's Rusal's aluminium products. He couldn't and he didn't. Some of these duties were never there in the first place.</p> <p>So it was a sheer delight to leave the campaign to drive Mandelson out of the cabinet for a third and final time and listen to the sumptuous oratorio, Elijah, of Felix Mendelssohn. (The anti-Semitic Wagner thought it kitsch). The Leipzig-based composer wrote it in 1846 for the Birmingham Festival and it is most often sung in English.</p> <p>Here it was sung in German by the multinational EU choir and four soloists, with an Austrian conducting the National Orchestra of Belgium in Victor Horta's glorious art nouveau main hall of the Palais des Beaux Arts.</p> <p>But, first, as the amateur chorus was celebrating the 50th anniversary of the EU, we all stood as the singers and orchestra belted out the Ode to Joy, the EU anthem written by Schiller and set by Beethoven as the final movement of his ninth symphony. It was the start of an evening of assertion of shared European culture and values: at times movingly sonorous but also cacophonous and disjointed. Bit like the current EU.</p> <p>More than 160 years after Mendelssohn composed his work, there is a sense here that, maybe, Europe is finally pulling its weight not just culturally but politically, economically and financially as a combined and coordinated grouping of 500 million citizens from 27 countries. And an awareness, too, that deep-layered fissures remain.</p> <p>There are the traditional shifts in alliances. President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolassarkozy\">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> and Chancellor Angela Merkel have fallen out, notably over his over-arching ambition to prolong his EU presidency beyond December 31 by another 12 months by taking control of the soon-to-be 16-strong eurogroup (Slovakia joins on January 1). The Czechs, who take over for the first half of 2009, are understandably miffed.</p> <p>The new dynamic duo in charge is Sarko and Gordon Brown, even though Britain, of course, remains doggedly outside the euro which Poland, perhaps Denmark and Sweden and even non-EU Iceland want to join. Given the predominant role of the City as Europe's leading financial centre, Brown is an ex-officio member.</p> <p>This week in Versailles, ahead of yet another EU summit hastily organised by the little French spinning top, the pair met to coordinate the EU's stance at the upcoming \"Bretton Woods 2\" conference in Washington in mid-November. But it was obvious, as they tried to out-sing each other, they were not even on the same score.</p> <p>Sarko may be driving to replace \"speculative\" with \"entrepreneurial\" capitalism, but some of his proposed measures look pretty old fashioned even for the new \"socialists\" Barack Obama and Hank Paulson across the pond. He is now talking of creating 100,000 extra state-subsidised jobs in the public sector (shades of Harold Wilson and George Brown).</p> <p>This would be on top of the mooted \u20ac175bn (\u00a3140bn) \"state participation vehicle\" or euro-sovereign wealth fund (SWF) that would inject capital into ailing industrial concerns and fend off nasty foreign predators such as Russia or Abu Dhabi. Anathema not only to our Gordon but also to Angela, both of whom welcome real SWFs.</p> <p>Sarko's plans, recalling his 2003 bail-out of engineering group Alstom, got a pretty dusty response, too, from Neelie Kroes, the EU competition commissioner, who has just approved Germany's \u20ac500bn bank rescue scheme by attaching a lot of strings \u2013 as she did for Gordon's. France's own plan appears to have got lost in the post between Paris and Brussels.</p> <p>In a speech at a thinktank, The Centre, delivered on her behalf by her director-general, Philip Lowe, she (absent with an eye infection) bluntly told Sarko and everybody else that there could be no \"subsidy war\" and \"no national route out of this crisis\".</p> <p>Lowe said: \"The state aid regime allows governments to intervene in the right way to boost jobs and growth in a sustainable manner.\" And that means investing in innovation, R&amp;D, green technologies, training, raising productivity, \"meeting needs that the market does not need\" and \"managing transition and minimising the social costs of economic change\".</p> <p>Pretty flexible, in other words \u2013 like making the Maastricht criteria on budget deficits and debt more elastic in the current recession. But, as with the banks, any national plans that distort competition \u2013 hello Northern Rock! \u2013 or give an unfair advantage to local companies will be vetoed. And, at the very least, they must be shortlived and come with schemes to restore these firms to viability, even in a shrunken form. </p> <p>In EC-speak, aid must meet the \"market economy investor principle\" \u2013 not be excessive. \"I admit it's a difficult criterion to apply in the current market turmoil,\" smiled Lowe.</p> <p>His words encapsulate the EU's dilemma in confronting the financial and macro-economic crisis: how to sustain unity in finding ways out of the recession and continuing to sing from the same hymn sheet of agreed rules when everybody is clamouring at home for emergency, rule-bending action.

The regional body the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is hosting the talks.</p> <p>The meeting follows a UN deal, brokered on Sunday, between the weak interim Somali government and an opposition group. The UN pact calls for Ethiopian troops, who intervened last year to back the transitional Somali government, to withdraw from key areas of the capital, Mogadishu, and regional centres.</p> <p>With nine months left before their mandate to rule expires, Transitional Front Government (TFG) leaders attending the Nairobi conference are expected to brief their neighbours on the progress they have made. The TFG denies it has been a failure.</p> <p>Mohamed Talha, the deputy speaker of parliament, said: \"We recognise ourselves that we have sacrificed and have been victimised. Many members of parliament were killed and injured. We lost many friends, and we want the international community and Somalis to recognise that we are heroes, not failures.\"</p> <p>The TFG has been fighting forces loyal to the Islamic Courts Union, which controlled the capital, and large parts of southern Somalia until Ethiopian troops drove it out of Mogadishu.</p> <p>The Islamic Courts' military wing, al-Shabaab, which has split into a separate force, has rejected the UN peace effort, saying it will carry on fighting. But anti-government forces are split, with some groups supporting the UN peace deal.</p> <p>The Nairobi conference is the latest initiative to try to bring peace to Somalia, which has been without an effective government since 1991. Aid groups <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/somalia\">describe Somalia</a> as one of the world's greatest humanitarian disasters - worse even than the western Sudanese region of Darfur.</p> <p>Nearly half of the country's population of 7 million depend on food aid, the UN estimates. Many have fled their homes in the capital and live on its outskirts in desperate conditions.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab's control of the southern port of Kismayo was underlined this week when its members stoned to death a woman accused of adultery, according to witnesses. </p> <p>The woman, who was 23, was killed in the town square in front of hundreds of people. She is the first person to be killed by stoning in Somalia for two years. When a relative and others pushed forward to rescue her, guards opened fire, killing a child.</p>",
  "<p>Improved security has failed to prevent Iraq becoming the scene of one of the world's most critical humanitarian disasters with water supplies and sewage systems putting millions at risk of disease, the Red Cross said today.</p> <p>The statement from the International Committee of the Red Cross said the situation has not improved significantly since March this year when the organisation published its report, Iraq: No Let-up in The Humanitarian Crisis.</p> <p>The report found that the humanitarian situation in Iraq following the US invasion was the worst in the world.</p> <p>Today's findings state that water supplies in the war-torn country have continued to deteriorate with even the most basic infrastructure not functioning.</p> <p>More than 40% of people are relying on poor quality and inadequate supplies and millions, especially children, are at serious risk of water-borne disease, the Red Cross said.</p> <p>Cholera cases peaked in a number of provinces during the hottest months of August and September.</p> <p>\"Iraqis urgently need access to clean water. They try to get it from rivers and wells but these sources are contaminated throughout the country so many people become ill,\" said Patrick Yussef, head of the Red Cross sub-delegation in Baghdad.</p> <p>Most of Iraq's water comes from its two main rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates, which are heavily polluted by household waste and litter. </p> <p>In poorer areas of Baghdad, streets are flooded with sewage, which seeps into walls and under the floors of houses until they collapse.</p> <p>Even though 10 litres of bottled water costs only 50 US cents, many Iraqis cannot afford to buy it and have to drink water from the polluted rivers.</p> <p>Hospitals are struggling to keep up with the numbers of sick. Equipment and medicines are in short supply and electricity shortages are common.</p> <p>\"There has been some improvement in recent months, both in terms of security and essential services,\" said Juan-Pedro Schaerer, head of the Red Cross delegation for Iraq. \"But far too many Iraqis still have no choice but to drink dirty water and live in insalubrious conditions.\"</p> <p>The most vulnerable are those living in the countryside and suburbs and not connected to a water network.</p> <p>The Red Cross is trying to gain more access into the country and said this has improved over the years.</p> <p>But Schaerer stressed that the situation of many civilians remains precarious. \"Clearly, fewer civilians are dying now than at the height of the conflict,\" he said. \"Nevertheless, men, women and children are being killed and injured in indiscriminate attacks every day. </p> <p>\"The ICRC reminds all parties to the conflict that they have an obligation under international humanitarian law to protect and respect civilians.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/ms-sclerosis-purdy\">Debbie Purdy</a> has lost her high court battle to clarify the law on assisted suicide. As the debate rages on about the relative merits and risks of legalising physician-assisted suicide, it's worth keeping several things in mind. In no <a href=\"http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-110.ZS.html\">jurisdiction</a> in the world is there a legally enforceable unconditional right to end one's life in the way that many proponents demand \u2013 choosing the precise time and manner of death at the hands of a third party. Where physician-assisted suicide is allowed, requirements may be strict (as in Oregon, where terminal illness is required) or they may manifest almost infinite elasticity (as in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7482/61\">Netherlands</a>, where patients who are clinically depressed, minors between 12 and 16, and people without a classifiable disease but who are \"suffering through living\" may request assisted suicide or, more commonly, ask to be killed outright by euthanasia). </p> <p>At most, legalisation gives physicians the right to accede to a patient's request without facing legal liability. And, of course, doctors can just say no, as they do in the Netherlands with astonishing frequency; fully two-thirds of requests by Dutch patients are denied. In all of these venues then, patients may ask, but they can't tell.</p> <p>In contrast, there is a long-standing and unconditional right in the UK and in most other countries to make our own medical decisions; we cannot be treated without our consent. With the advent of medical technologies that can prolong mere biological existence for years, even decades, this right has been applied to decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.</p> <p>In the UK, patients have the absolute right to refuse such treatment. We have the right to demand that treatment once started be withdrawn. We can even refuse or discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration. We can exercise this right to decide our fate contemporaneously when competent, and prospectively, under the authority of the Mental Capacity Act of 2007, through legally binding instruments that give effect to our wishes after we become legally incompetent. There are two types \u2013 living wills (also called advance directives and now renamed advance statements) in which we spell out the treatments we don't want, and healthcare proxies, also called lasting powers of attorney, through which we assign our right to make medical decisions to someone whom we trust.</p> <p>The American embrace of advance directives began in 1976, with the case of <a href=\"http://www.karenannquinlanhospice.org/History.htm\">Karen Ann Quinlan</a>. After a drug overdose, she slipped into a persistent vegetative state (PVS), losing all high-brain function. Her parents asked the New Jersey supreme court for permission to remove her ventilator. The court agreed. Her parents never asked for withdrawal of nutrition and hydration. Karen lived for another decade. The first living will law was passed in California in 1976. For many years, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have had living will or healthcare proxy statutes or a combination of both.</p> <p>Recently, George Bush did his part to stoke anxiety and increase demand. First his brother and then he intervened in the case of <a href=\"http://www.terrisfight.org/\">Terri Schiavo</a>, a 40-year-old Florida woman who had been in PVS for 14 years. When her husband won the right to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration, and her parents challenged the ruling, <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34974\">Governor Jeb Bush asked</a> the Florida legislature to pass Terri's Law, which overturned the court decision. The husband appealed and won, and then <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/31/schiavo/index.html\">Congress and the president</a> got involved. The husband ultimately prevailed but before he did, horrified Americans jammed the website of <a href=\"http://www.deathanddying.us/list1/lastacts.asp\">Last Acts Partnership</a>, which provides state-specific living wills and healthcare proxies. Average requests went from 3,500 per month to 20,000.</p> <p>There is now a similar and equally controversial case <a href=\"http://assistedsuicide.org/blog/2008/08/03/controversy-in-italy-over-woman-16-years-in-coma/\">in Italy</a> where withdrawal of treatment is allowed but not euthanasia or physician assisted suicide. </p> <p>Letting someone die is morally, medically and legally acceptable in two situations: either patients or their surrogates have validly refused treatment, or treatment, if provided would be futile. In either case, termination of treatment is not killing because there is no duty to treat.</p> <p>In his Guardian column on October 22, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/assisted-euthanasia-religion-suicide-prosecution\">Simon Jenkins wrote</a> that \"the most common cause of death in Britain\" is \"death by killing\". Doctors do the killing, he said. \"One-third of all registered deaths are by deliberate morphine overdose and one-third by the removal of life support, premeditated acts by medical staff.\"</p> <p>He's wrong. Neither of these practices is killing. Moreover, his characterisation of the removal of life support risks undermining the ability of patients to control their medical care. It's also profoundly disempowering. Directing the removal of life support either contemporaneously or prospectively is a manifestation of patient autonomy, not victimhood.</p> <p>Jenkins' second accusation \u2013 that deliberate morphine overdose is killing \u2013 is a position taken by some advocates of euthanasia and assisted suicide in an attempt to convince courts that the practices are analogous. They are not. When a physician administers morphine as a means of pain relief, there is a risk that death will be hastened on account of depressed respiration. If doctors are made to feel that the provision of such palliative care is covert euthanasia, the likely outcome is more patients with unrelieved pain.</p> <p>We do not know what the future holds with respect to legalisation of assisted suicide. But it's clear that advance decisions allow us to exert a great deal of control over the last chapter of our lives.

  "<p>The Channel 4 director of acquisitions, Jeff Ford, is to rejoin Channel Five in the first big appointment by new chief executive Dawn Airey since she arrived back at the broadcaster on Monday.</p> <p>The move comes ahead of a wide-ranging review of Channel Five's operations by Boston Consulting Group ordered by Airey.</p> <p>Ford, who previously worked at Five as director of acquisitions between 1997 and 2005, will take on a new board-level role as managing director of digital channels and acquisitions, MediaGuardian.co.uk can reveal.</p> <p>Airey has been keen to make a splash since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/27/channelfive.itv\">arriving back at Five</a> this week after leaving ITV six months ago.</p> <p>She was previously director of programmes at the broadcaster in 1996 before being promoted to chief executive in 2000 - a role she held until 2003 when she moved to BSkyB.<br> Airey held a meeting with Five staff on Monday in which she told them that job cuts would be made and a wide-ranging review into its operations would be undertaken.</p> <p>It is thought Airey will be unlikely to make any further significant personnel changes until the review has been completed.</p> <p>Her appointment of Ford, who joined Channel 4 from Five three years ago, will boost morale at the broadcaster. </p> <p>It is believed Ford has been unhappy at Channel 4 following the broadcaster's decision to scale back its acquisition budget by \u00a335m over five years.</p> <p>His last deal at Channel 4 was bringing US drama 90210 to the broadcaster, beating off rivals including Five. The deal was signed off earlier this month and announced on Monday.</p> <p>Five's schedule is dominated by imports including Australian soaps Neighbours and Home and Away, and US shows such as CSI, NCIS and Law and Order. </p> <p>The broadcaster also recently bought new American series The Mentalist.</p> <p>Five is said to be bringing in Boston Consulting Group to conduct a \"root and branch\" review of the broadcaster's cost base and business processes.</p> <p>It is not known if the review will lead to redundancies - but previous strategic reviews by BCG at rival broadcasters have ultimately led to job cuts.</p> <p>Both BSkyB and ITV, Airey's previous employer, have used the Boston Consulting Group in a bid to cut costs as the economy forces broadcasters to rethink business models and tighten their belts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/31/bskyb.mediabusiness1\">BSkyB announced in July that it was to cut 250 posts</a>; earlier this month ITV announced it was to shed 1,000 staff.</p> <p>Last month Channel 4 announced up to 150 job cuts as part of a cost-cutting programme aimed at saving \u00a3100m over two years.</p> <p>Five confirmed that Ford would join early next year, taking responsibility for the broadcaster's digital channels Fiver and Five US as well as acquisitions across all channels. </p> <p>He will report to Airey, who is also chair of Five, as well as sitting on the broadcaster's executive board.</p> <p>\"I am thrilled Jeff is coming back to Five. He is undoubtedly one of the best acquisitions executives in the world and he will make a significant contribution to the revitalisation and success of Five,\" Airey said.</p> <p>Ford added: \"I'm very excited to be returning to Five and working, once again, with Dawn Airey. When I first joined the channel in 1997 Dawn and I were part of a team that helped create a brand that connected with a UK audience looking for something unique, fun and honest. </p> <p>\"I'm proud to return to Five to further build on its reputation for the best of US shows, enhance the digital channels and help Dawn create, develop and implement a future strategy for the company as we approach digital switchover.\" </p> <p>Channel 4 is not expected to replace Ford directly, with director of television and content Kevin Lygo taking a more active role in acquisitions negotiations.</p> <p>While at Five, Ford was responsible for bringing shows such as CSI, Law and Order and Home and Away to the broadcaster. </p> <p>In 2003, he added the role of managing editor to his acquisitions responsibilities as well as deputising for the director of programmes and overseeing drama. </p> <p>He joined Channel 4 in July 2005 as director of acquisitions, responsible for both feature film and series acquisition across its portfolio of channels.</p> <p>In 2006, he also took over strategic management for Film4 following its free-to-air relaunch. </p> <p>At Channel 4, Ford brought Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives and My Name is Earl to the broadcaster.</p> <p>Before joining Five, he was controller of acquisitions for the ITV Network between 1995 and 1997. </p> <p>He began his TV career at the BBC, moving into the programme purchasing department in 1985. </p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Jacqui Smith's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/28/jacqui-smith-extremists-home-office\">plan</a> to strengthen the rules on preventing people entering Britain who are \"suspected of stirring up tensions\" is likely to stir up tensions of its own. Animal rights extremists and neo-Nazis will be covered under the rules, but the primary target is of course extremist Islamic clerics.</p> <p>The aim is to prevent extreme forms of Islam gaining traction in British Muslim communities, as the Home Secretary puts it, \"to stop those who foster, encourage or spread extremism and hatred through preaching violent messages in our communities\". The plan has drawn fire from some as being a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/28/immigrationpolicy-uksecurity\">PR gimmick</a>\". But more importantly, it won't work, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, listening to radical preachers rant and rave about Jewish conspiracies or the importance of jihad doesn't turn someone into an Islamic extremist. In <a href=\"www.demos.co.uk/projects/fromthreattoopportunity\">Demos' research</a> into the relationship between radicalisation and violence, we are finding that vitriolic speeches calling on people to fight infidels are readily available. But on their own, they never lead anyone into action.</p> <p>Indeed, the leaked MI5 report on violent extremism in Britain suggested the influence of extremist clerics had \"moved into the background\". There is a much more tangled web of influences at work, and forcibly shutting up radical preachers can even be counter-productive. Anything the government ever bans usually becomes, by default, more exciting. Just as 16 year olds will clamber to watch any video that has been banned by MTV, the hits on a preacher's website will quadruple the instant he is not welcome in the UK.</p> <p>Secondly, governments today are powerless to stop the propagation of these ideas anyway: you can ban someone from the country but you can't ban them from the internet. Omar Mohammed Bakri \u2013 founder of the infamous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/3670007.stm\">al-Muhajiroun</a> group \u2013 fled Britain in 2006 and was barred from returning. And yet in September this year he was addressing a meeting of around 100 young Muslims in Lea Bridge Road, Leyton, via a live webcam link to his home in Lebanon. He was treated like a rockstar, his popularity undimmed. If young people want to find these speeches, they know where to look.</p> <p>Al-Qaida is no longer just a network or religious ideology, it's a bestselling brand. It has become the emblem of youth and rebellion, a dominant counter-culture, and its leaders are cool as Che Guevara once was. Part of the appeal is the adventure, excitement, and notoriety that being part of a counter-establishment movement brings. In this world, banned preachers will always be more popular than those the government chooses to allow in.</p> <p>It might be quite right to ban some extremist preachers from entering the UK, as the Home Office proposes, on a \"case by case basis\". While no two preachers are ever the same, some hold views are simply despicable and disgusting. Preventing them from entering the UK might prove to empower liberal Islam, and send out a strong signal that this country will not allow intolerance to be openly advocated on our shores, but it won't stop the spread of violent extremism.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandcricketteam\" title=\"\">England</a> should once again be declared the winners of the controversial 2006 Oval Test forfeited by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/pakistancricketteam\" title=\"\">Pakistan</a>, according to the ICC president David Morgan. The result of the game was changed from an England win to a draw by the ICC in July, meaning England won the series 2-0 rather than 3-0.</p> <p>\"It was a decision that was made by the ICC and it's a decision that I was not happy with,\" said Morgan, after the MCC met in India last week and urged the ICC to overturn its ruling. \"I was president elect and I didn't believe it was appropriate to change the result of the England-Pakistan match.\"</p> <p>Morgan said that it was still possible for the ICC to reverse their previous ruling after the MCC - the game's law makers - came to the conclusion that the ICC board had made the wrong decision. He added that he'd like to read the minutes of the meeting, too, after the MCC stated: \"the ICC had no power under the laws of cricket to decide that results should be altered, whether it feels it 'inappropriate' or otherwise.\"</p> <p>\"The ICC's decision is wrong and sets a very dangerous precedent. Cricket is the worse for this decision,\" continued the committee chairman Tony Lewis.</p> <p>The win was initially awarded to England by umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove when, on the fourth day of the fourth Test, Inzaman-ul-Haq refused to allow his team back onto the pitch. The Pakistan captain was angry that umpires had given England a five-run penalty after the team was accused of ball tampering. The team were later cleared of the allegations, while Inzaman was suspended for four games for bringing the game into disrepute. Hair, meanwhile, was removed from the panel of international umpires before being reinstated after an employment tribunal hearing last October.</p>",
  "<p>Who would have thought that those dapper Swedes the Hives might also be thieves?

Shapiro recorded the track not once but twice - with the Roofies in 1997 and then again with Three Way in 2002. </p> <p>\"I absolutely love The Hives and don't feel great about suing a band I love,\" Shapiro recently told LA Weekly. \"But I also feel credit is due where it is due if you borrow a riff.\"</p> <p>News of the similarity came to him on the wings of a movie trailer - friends got in touch after hearing Tick Tick Boom in a trailer for Get Smart. Just to make sure he wasn't crazy, Shapiro consulted with a musicologist about the resemblance between the songs. </p> <p>\"He said the part in question - the main riff and vocal melody - was very similar and its uniqueness led him to believe it wasn't just a coincidence,\" Shapiro said. \"He also runs it through a background test seeing if any charts from previous songs are close and we were clear on that front.\"</p> <p>While the songs' music videos don't have much in common: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqkJ30Kh7ZM\">the Hives' Tick Tick Boom here</a> and <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=nIHtEcQT2Po\">Jason Shapiro and the Roofies here</a>; we admit that the songs do.

  "<p>The latest in our series of classic reports comes from this week in October 1986, when Nigel Mansell went into the Australian grand prix as favourite for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> drivers' crown. It was the season finale and Birmingham's finest racing driver only had to finish third to claim the title. Unfortunately, Alain Prost was also capable of winning, and that's exactly what he did - although not through any fault of Mansell's. Richard Yallop's report from Adelaide relays all the drama of the afternoon and captures Mansell's heartbreak on missing out. It would be six years until he finally avenged the defeat.</p> <p><strong>Nigel's good year shredded</strong></p> <p>Alain Prost took wing in yesterday's Australian grand prix, while Nigel Mansell, the pre-race favourite for the world championship, afterwards had the limp and lifeless look of a bird with broken wings.</p> <p>All week he had been cheeping merrily about the race but, in the shock of defeat, after a blown tyre took him out of the race in the 63rd lap, ending his hopes of a first British world championship since James Hunt in 1976, he could barely speak. He trudged back from his crippled machine to the Williams pits, embraced his wife, Roseanne, shooed away the hovering press vultures, and locked himself in his caravan.</p> <p>Looking ashen and on the verge of collapse, Mansell eventually emerged from the caravan, only to be pressed back against a wire fence by the pursuing pack of journalists and cameramen. He turned towards the fence, and propped himself up on it, whispering to a Williams official, as though deciding on a common plan of attack. Then he snapped out at the reporters: \"Okay, I'm doing one press conference, all together, and that's it.</p> <p>\"It was a desperate race today. When Nelson overtook me he nearly forced me off the road, and when Alain passed it was pretty close. I figured I didn't have to fight, and let them go.\"</p> <p>The competition at the start was so savage that by the end of the first lap Mansell, who was on pole, had dropped to fourth, behind Piquet, Senna and Prost. He needed only to finish third and did not show the same desperation as Piquet or Prost, both of whom had to win.</p> <p>Yesterday was Mansell's Dunkirk. \"I'm no nationality but English,\" he said proudly, having pulled himself together in the caravan. \"Roseanne is terribly upset. Being English, we need a bit of time to bounce back. Now we can have some family time, and see the people we haven't seen for months, and get some room to breath.\"</p> <p>Mansell has a bit of a reputation as a whinger, but he was gracious in defeat. \"I'm very, very pleased for Alain, but I'm disappointed for Nelson, and for Frank Williams, and the team. I think they acted in a very responsible way today.\"</p> <p>The key twists in the grand prix plot were provided by the Goodyear tyres on the Williams and McLaren cars. In the 34th lap a puncture had forced Prost, then second behind Rosberg, into the pits for a 17-second tyre change. It was some measure of Prost's cool mastery that he could make that up and get back to the leaders.</p> <p>When the Goodyear officials saw the state of Prost's tyres they decided the cars would be able to get through the 82-lap race without a change, and advised team officials accordingly. Rosberg, whose tyre lost its tread in the 62nd lap, and Mansell, whose tyre blew a lap later, had cause to regret that they did not change.</p> <p>\"We don't know what happened,\" said Goodyear's racing manager, Lee Gaug. \"At first we thought Nigel was touched, but he said he wasn't. They had all planned to stop for a change until we saw Prost's tyres, and then our projection was that they could do 82 laps without stopping. There was no reason to call Mansell in.\"</p> <p>After Rosberg's tyre went the Williams team called Mansell in, but before he reached the pits his tyre blew. He did well to control the car as it slewed across the straight. Piquet, the leader, was immediately called in to change his tyres for safety reasons, and Prost was left in front. Piquet closed to within four seconds of the leader because Prost had to slow to conserve fuel. He finished with the gauge showing minus five litres.</p> <p>Rosberg told Prost beforehand that if he was leading at the end he would let the Frenchman past for the championship. \"He helped me a lot being first, like a rabbit,\" Prost said. \"The two Williams had to push very hard to catch him. So, thank you to Keke.\"</p> <p>The win made Prost, aged 31, only the third driver to retain the championship after Jack Brabham in 1960 and Juan Fangio, champion from 1954-57. Appropriately Sir Jack was in Adelaide yesterday to witness Prost's singleminded brilliance.</p>",
  "<p>There are plenty of things in life, which, whilst perfectly enjoyable in their own right, should never be combined. Sex and football; hand-dived scallops and cheesy mash; Simon Schama and Peter Kay; alcohol and landing a plane; that sort of thing. To this list I would add: eating in a restaurant and \"entertainment\". <br><br>It is not a view shared by Jean-Paul Maurel. His Bel Canto mini-chain already runs two, ahem, \"lyrical dining\" restaurants in Paris, which combine food and live opera. He has just opened a third in <a href=\"http://www.lebelcanto.co.uk\">London</a>. At a whopping \u00a365-a-head for three courses, diners eat as a cast of professional and student singers perform popular Puccini and Verdi arias <a href=\"http://www.hotel-blogs.com/guillaume_thevenot/2008/10/been-there-26-.html\">on the restaurant floor</a>. Were that not traumatic enough, at the end of the evening, guests - yes, the tone deaf, the drunk, the overbearing am-dram enthusiast - are invited to join in with a rousing chorus of Libiamo from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_traviata\">La Traviata</a>. </p> <p>I don't know much (ie. anything) about opera, but I know enough about eating out and listening to music, to know that the two things are mutually exclusive activities. At its best, eating in a restaurant is all about steeping yourself in the pleasures of good food, drink, friends and conversation. Not dutifully paying attention to a singer, or, worse, being press-ganged into joining in the \"fun\", like some broadsheet-approved version of Butlins. </p> <p>Similarly, at its best, live music is an essentially solitary activity, about absorbing yourself in sound, even if you're in a room with 300 people. It should also involve noisy enthusiasm and/ or unselfconscious dancing, neither of which I want at the next table while I'm trying to eat.</p> <p>It's not just music that grates in a restaurant setting. Roving magicians, film shows, comedians, roulette tables; all of them are equally unwelcome distractions from what's on your plate. Although, judging by Jan Moir's review at <a href=\"http://areyoureadytoorder.co.uk/review.php?id=305\">Are You Ready To Order?</a>, in Bel Canto's case - \"The food makes you want to hurl yourself off the nearest battlements,\" is her weary conclusion - the operatic interruptions may come as a blessed relief.</p> <p>If the theory of in-restaurant entertainment is flawed, its invariably timid execution compounds the offence. Bel Canto concentrates, unsurprisingly, on pieces from \"the world's most celebrated operas\". Wagner's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/05/15/bmwag15.xml\">more challenging works</a> - which, I imagine, a serious opera buff might find more interesting - would hardly be a pleasant aural digestif, or a big draw. Which is the whole problem. </p> <p>If you really care about food, or you really care about music, you won't find satisfaction in the same room. Commercial necessity means restaurants will always go for the most MOR entertainment option available - tinkling pianists; jolly, scat-tastic Cleo Laine-wannabes; gutless flamenco guitarists, slinky, soulful acid jazz combos - rather than anyone doing anything even moderately challenging. It is better to not piss anyone off, than risk giving anyone any genuine pleasure. </p> <p>It's the same malaise that affects background music in restaurants. Restaurant Magazine used to have a column, Ma\u00eetre DJ, wherein managers talked the mag through their playlists. God it was depressing. To a man, the respondents favoured the kind of bland, offensively-inoffensive musical styles - beige trip-hop, funky house, coffee table world music collections, light jazz - that are only really liked by the kind of people who, fundamentally, don't like music.</p> <p>Even when it's good, it's bad. Because music is just too personal for such general public spaces. I was quietly amazed at <a href=\"http://www.vermilioncinnabar.com/\">Vermilion</a> in Manchester, recently, to find a DJ playing <a href=\"http://www.bookashade.com/\">Booka Shade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/cutcopy\">Cut Copy</a> and other fine electro in the bar, after I'd eaten. I was a bit tired and emotional, and I warmly congratulated him on his good taste. However, by the looks of things, the three generations of the same family at the next table, and the couples trying to have a romantic night out, were distinctly lukewarm. Who can blame them? </p> <p>My attitude is simple: say no to entertainment, <a href=\"http://nomuzak.co.uk/orientation.html\">muzak</a> and gimmicks, and say yes to the <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/openhouse/2008/04/i-was-saddened.html\">convivial noise of conversation</a>. </p> <p>But what do you think? Am I in a tiny, music-obsessed minority? Do you think Bel Canto <a href=\"http://www.parislogue.com/dining-out/wine-dinner-and-song-bel-canto.html\">sounds like fun</a>? Do you love to tap-a-toe over dessert? Does the rise of the <a href=\"http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2103764.0.Curryoke_row_strikes_the_wrong_note.php\">\"curryoke\"</a> restaurant (yes, that's curry and karaoke) fill you with dread or excitement? You can put me down, if you must, for Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now....</p>",
  "<p>The Conservative culture spokesman, Jeremy Hunt, has today joined the mounting criticism from senior politicians of the BBC over the \"Sachsgate\" row in a speech about the future of public service broadcasting, as the number of complaints hit 18,000.</p> <p>Hunt said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a>'s pranks calls to Andrew Sachs should not have been broadcast on Radio 2 because they could encourage antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>The Conservative MP's comments realise what must be the BBC's worst fear over the scandal - that the prank calls row would start to bleed into the ongoing debate about Ofcom's review of the future of public service broadcasting.</p> <p>Complaints to the BBC over the affair have nearly doubled overnight, from 10,400 at 5pm yesterday to just over 18,000 at around 9.30am today. The BBC has had about 1,000 phone call complaints and the rest via its website.<br> Media pressure on the BBC has also intensified overnight, with nearly every daily paper running the Sachsgate story on its front page and numerous calls for Brand, Ross, and the executives responsible for the October 18 broadcast to be sacked.</p> <p>\"Just as it would be wrong in a plural and democratic society to require broadcasters to produce programmes that meet government objectives and promote social behaviour, so it is also wrong for broadcasters to produce programmes that legitimise negative social behaviour,\" Hunt said in a speech to the London School of Economics.</p> <p>\"That is why the BBC was quite wrong to take the decision to broadcast the offensive phone calls made by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross to Andrew Sachs,\" he added.</p> <p>Hunt accepted that public service broadcasters are not tools for social engineering, but criticised those that used \"worthy\" programmes as a \"figleaf\" for the rest of their output. </p> <p>\"It's not good enough for Channel 4 to say they are doing their bit with a Dispatches programme on alcohol abuse like Drinking Yourself to Death, when 18% of the screen time on Hollyoaks was accounted for by alcohol references,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Nor can [Channel] Five claim to be doing their bit with Diet Doctors Inside Out when the gym instructor in Home and Away is seen with alcohol in 50% of his scenes.\"</p> <p>Hunt held out the prospect, under a Conservative government, of lighter touch regulation for broadcasters who signed up to new deals on socially responsible output. </p> <p>\"By doing this I believe we can harness the power of a subsidised media sector in a way that avoids both state control and heavy-handed regulation.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

Thousands more troop through apartment buildings and walk the streets of suburban neighborhoods knocking on the doors of total strangers. Their numbers increase at night, when their own working days are over. Their targets are most likely to be homes, and mobile phone minutes are free. This kind of activity takes place across the US every four years - but never before on this scale. By all estimates, Barack Obama's campaign is running the largest political field operation in history.</p> <p>No one can say exactly how many volunteers are now working to elect Obama. At one point, the campaign said it would <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/20/obamas_paid_staff_dwarfing_mccains/?page=3\">mobilize 6 million by election day</a>, but it's impossible reliably to confirm that number, or any other. Like Russell Tucker, who has come to Missouri from South Carolina, many of them have traveled from states dyed so deeply red or blue that their own votes can't change the final electoral count. They want to be where the action is, and where they can make a difference.</p> <p>While Obama has far more paid staff and more money than McCain, the biggest contrast is in volunteers on the ground. <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight.com's</a> Sean Quinn - who, like the Guardian team, is traveling across the country west to east, but with a special focus on grassroots fieldwork - had reached Missouri when he <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/10/on-road-st-louis-county-missouri.html\">wrote</a>: \"Let's be clear. We've observed no comparison between these ground campaigns. To begin with, there's a 4-1 ratio of offices in most states.\" John McCain's campaign offices tend to be sparsely populated, according to Quinn, and they \"are also calm, sedate. Little movement. No hustle. In the Obama offices, it's a whirlwind. People move. It's a dynamic bustle ... You could take every McCain volunteer we've seen doing actual work in the entire trip, over six states, and it would add up to the same as Obama's single Thornton, Colorado office.\"</p> <p>This kind of campaigning is exhausting, inefficient, time-consuming and expensive. It also works better than anything else does - especially in the final weeks before an election, when getting out the vote is everything. In a series of well-known field studies, two Yale political scientists, Donald Green and Alan Gerber, found that personal, one-to-one appeals by volunteers are <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2203146/\">the most effective tactic for increasing turnout</a>. Door-to-door canvassing is by far the best, producing on average one vote for every fourteen visits; personal phone calls by volunteers are the next best. Mailings, emails and calls from paid telemarketers are, by comparison, almost useless.</p> <p>The same is true of robocalls, a favoured strategy of the McCain campaign. Here in Missouri, residents report receiving <a href=\"http://ozarksfirst.com/content/fulltext/?cid=73261\">calls</a> with the now familiar refrain, \"Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organisation bombed the US Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home, and killed Americans. And Democrats will enact an extreme leftist agenda if they take control of Washington.\" Another has <a href=\"http://www.stjoenews.net/news/2008/oct/24/war-robo-calls-begins/\">Rudy Giuliani </a> saying that Obama is soft on crime.</p> <p>As part of a Republican campaign strategy that now seems to be based almost exclusively on arousing voters' fears, these calls make sense. But if the experts are right, they can't compete with boots on the ground.</p>",
  "<p>Assisted suicide is outlawed in the UK, with the 1961 Suicide Act making it illegal to \"aid, abet, counsel or procure the suicide of another\". Helping somebody to die carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.</p> <p>But how that law is interpreted is unclear. The director of public prosecutions (DPP) has not prosecuted any relative of the 100 Britons who have gone abroad to end their lives at clinics run by the Swiss organisation Dignitas.</p> <p>Debbie Purdy, who has multiple sclerosis and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/29/assisted-suicide-right-to-die\">asked the DPP to detail the exact circumstances</a> in which a person can be prosecuted for helping someone die, learns the ruling today.</p> <p>Purdy successfully appealed in June for a judicial review in the high court on the grounds that the DPP had acted illegally by not providing guidance.</p> <p>Euthanasia or \"mercy killing\" has been \"decriminalised\" in a number of European countries, including the Netherlands and Belgium.</p> <p>Several attempts to legalise assisted suicide in Britain have been rejected. The most recent, in 2006, was defeated in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 100.</p> <p>A similar case to Purdy's arose in 2001, when Diane Pretty, a 43-year-old who suffered from motor neurone disease, sought to get immunity from prosecution for her husband if he helped her to die in the UK.</p> <p>The DPP refused to give Pretty an undertaking not to prosecute her husband, which was upheld by the high court in August 2001 and the House of Lords in November that same year.</p> <p>Pretty's lawyer, Shami Chakrabarti, asked the European court of human rights whether a terminally ill person could refuse life-saving or life-prolonging medical treatment and lawfully choose to die.</p> <p>She said the UK law on assisted suicide infringed Pretty's human rights, under article two of the European convention \u2013 the right to life.</p> <p>But the court upheld the House of Lords' ruling, stating that article two was also there to protect life and that an intentional consensual killing in the context of \"voluntary euthanasia\" was regarded in English law as murder.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 28 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Climate change bill</strong><br>The government made key concessions to include aviation and shipping emissions within the landmark climate change bill. The move followed a campaign by environmentalists and a threatened Labour rebellion. Under amendments, the climate change committee will be required to consider the emissions when setting carbon budgets.</p> <p>Climate change minister Joan Ruddock said: \"We agree that action to reduce emissions from international aviation and shipping will be vital to global efforts to tackle climate change.\" The government agreed that those emissions should \"either be included in the bill's targets and budgets ... or an explanation should be laid before parliament explaining why this has not been done\".</p> <p>Tory spokesman Gregory Barker said: \"We warmly welcome the government's change of heart and measured response to include emissions from international aviation and shipping in the climate change bill.\"</p> <p>The climate change secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \"This will make us the first country in the world to enshrine in law binding climate change targets and stretching ambitious targets, and they need to be so, to 80% by 2050.\" The bill was given a third reading by 463 votes to three.</p> <p><strong>'Smart meters'</strong><br>The government announced plans to install gas and electricity \"smart meters\" in all homes by 2020. Smart meters allow two-way communication between the user and the supplier and can display information such as daily usage and the cost of energy being used. Energy minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath said: \"No other country in the world has moved to an electricity and gas smart meter roll-out on this scale.\"</p> <p><strong>Early release of prisoners</strong><br>The justice secretary, Jack Straw, was accused of being \"astonishingly complacent\" following revelations that prisoners released early under a controversial scheme were alleged to have committed three murders. For the Tories, Nick Herbert said the government was \"clearly putting the public at risk\" and called for the end of custody licence scheme to be scrapped.</p> <p>Straw expressed \"regret\" over the scheme, which allows offenders to be released 18 days early, and said he wanted to see it wound up. He said he wanted to end the scheme \"as soon as there is sufficient prison capacity to do so\".</p> <p><strong>Plans to buy private jets</strong><br>The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Norman Baker, demanded an inquiry into why \u00a31.25m was spent on government analysis into plans to buy two private jets for the prime minister and royal family. Plans for the jets - dubbed Blair Force One - were scrapped in March following a year-long analysis by the transport department.</p> <p>Transport minister Jim Fitzpatrick said: \"We see no need for an internal inquiry.\"</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand</strong><br>Justice minister David Hanson urged Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand to apologise for the offensive phone calls made to veteran actor Andrew Sachs. <br>Hanson said he did not think the two broadcasters' behaviour was \"appropriate\" or \"in keeping with broadcasting\". He told MPs: \"I'm not sure it will result in prosecutions. But I do feel an apology is called for.\"</p> <p><strong>Reoffending rates</strong><br>Edward Garnier, for the Tories, accused the government of not doing enough to cut reoffending rates by helping offenders to acquire new skills in prison. He hit out at ministerial \"incompetence\" over the provision of \"purposeful activity\" in prisons.</p> <p>Hanson said crime overall was down 39% since 1997 and reoffending figures were also down over the last six years. He added that each prisoner currently undertook 25.3 hours of purposeful activity per week. \"That's a steady figure and one I want to increase.\"</p> <p><strong>Landsbanki</strong><br>Use of anti-terrorism powers to freeze UK assets of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki was perhaps \"inelegant\" and \"uncomfortable\" but it \"was highly effective in protecting the interests of British depositors and the British economy\", the Treasury financial services secretary, Lord Myners, said. He was outlining the Landsbanki freezing order and an amendment to the order, which both came into force within hours of being laid.</p> <p><strong>Parliament Square protesters</strong><br>The government must consult with Commons authorities over laws designed to deal with protesters in Parliament Square, Speaker Michael Martin ruled. He was responding to complaints that anti-war protesters were using loud hailers \"persistently, incessantly and at unreasonable volume\".</p> <p><strong>Metropolitan Black Police Association</strong><br>Home Office minister Lord West of Spithead described as \"outrageous\" and \"damaging\" the Metropolitan Black Police Association's attempts to persuade ethnic minorities not to join the force.</p> <p><strong>GBL</strong><br>A legal \"date rape drug\" that is widely available for sale on the internet should be banned, the government was urged. Labour former Home Office minister Joan Ryan (Enfield N) said the colourless and odourless GBL, known as \"liquid ecstasy\", can render victims incapable of resisting sexual advances.</p> <p><strong>Chinese army officer cadets training at Sandhurst</strong><br>The government's decision to allow Chinese army officer cadets to train at Sandhurst flouts a European Union ban and could jeopardise military cooperation with the US, Tory Ben Wallace (Lancaster and Wyre) warned. Officer cadet Liu Liu passed out of the prestigious military training college this summer as a result of what Wallace said was a \"dangerous and silly\" programme of cooperation with the People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>Armed forces Minister Bob Ainsworth said Wallace's claims were \"palpable nonsense\" designed to stir up trouble.<br></p>",

PwC are <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/lehman-may-take-10-years-to-wind-up-951388.html\">administrators</a> and could be collecting fees for another ten years. Following previous violations of auditor independence rules, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prosecuted E&amp;Y and in a withering 69-page <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id249bpm.pdf\">judgment</a> the judge concluded that the firm \"committed repeated violation of the auditor independence standards by conduct that was reckless, highly unreasonable and negligent\".</p> <p>A 2005 US <a href=\"http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2005/psitaxshelterreport.021005.pdf\">Senate report</a> (page 6) concluded that E&amp;Y sold \"tax products to multiple clients despite evidence that some ... were potentially abusive or illegal tax shelters\".

The firm eventually resigned but the insolvency examiner said this was motivated by \"its concerns over its own potential liability for aiding and abetting a fraud\" (<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/ExaminerReportjuly10.pdf\">pages 198-199</a>).</p> <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers gave a clean bill of health (page 113) to <a href=\"http://www.freddiemac.com/investors/ar/pdf/2007annualrpt.pdf\">Freddie Mac</a>, which was bailed out by the US government, and received $73.3 million in <a href=\"http://report.vhostu.com/freddie_mac_proxy_2008/02/2008proxy.pdf\">fees</a> (page 86). Following revelations of fraud at a software manufacturer, earlier this year the SEC <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2008/34-57303.pdf\">banned</a> a former partner of the firm from practicing because he \"did not exercise due professional care and professional skepticism, and failed to obtain sufficient competent evidential matter\".

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/nottinghamforest\">Nottingham Forest</a> may feel Christmas has come early, with snow falling in South-west London as their coach pulled away, laden with three points from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/championship\">Championship</a> fixture for the first time since early August.</p> <p>Colin Calderwood is happy to be off the foot of the Championship table, a position he feels is unsuited to his team and the manner in which they play: \"It's nice to have the win off the back of a good performance. They've played solid with a lot of spirit and I think everyone could see it,\" said the Forest manager.</p> <p>The home side drew level in the second half after going a goal down before half-time but the Forest substitute Matt Thornhill won the game with nine minutes to go after another substitute, Shefki Kuqi, had equalised for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/crystalpalace\">Palace</a>.</p> <p>Having survived a second-minute scare from Robert Earnshaw thanks to a fine save by their goalkeeper, Julian Speroni, Palace slowly began to take control midway through the first half.</p> <p>However, the momentum of the first period changed when Forest went ahead against the run of play on 28 minutes. Chris Cohen's sharply inswinging free-kick evaded everyone in the box and left Speroni rooted to the spot.</p> <p>Palace's manager, Neil Warnock, introduced Kuqi at half-time and there was a renewed vigour from the Londoners, Nick Carle going close after superb wing play from Paul Ifill down the right.</p> <p>Palace's sporadic pressure finally paid off with 15 minutes to go when Kuqi gathered the ball 20 yards out and, with his back to goal, turned and sent a powerful low shot to the right of Lee Camp.</p> <p>But Forest sealed the win and their ticket away from the foot of the table with nine minutes to go when James Perch's shot was cleared off the line only to be turned in from an acute angle by Thornhill.</p>",
  "<h2>Arnulf Rainer - Untitled (1969-1974)</h2> <p>Self-portraiture with a manic twist, Rainer's distressed photographs represent the ultimate in narcissistic come-down. Art about self-identity that is desperate to escape staid self-consciousness. (RC)</p> <h2>Raphael - The Marriage of the Virgin (1504), Agnolo and Maddalena Doni (c1506-1507), The Entombment (1507), The Bridgewater Madonna (c1507), The School of Athens (1509-1510), Pope Julius II (1511), Galatea (1511-1512), Madonna della Sedia (c1512), The Liberation of St Peter (c1512-1513), The Sistine Madonna (c1512-1514), Sistine Tapestry Cartoons (1515-1516), The Fire in the Borgo (c1516-1517), St Michael (1518), Transfiguration (1518-1520), La Fornarina (1518-1520)</h2> <p>The perfection of Raphael's art, which once made him the most revered painter of all, has done much to harm his popularity in modern times. Today he is in the curious position of being at once indestructibly famous, irremovably in the canon, and yet largely unloved.</p> <p>People are trained now to dislike art like Raphael's without really looking at it: the very words that praise it - harmonious, proportionate, classical - condemn it to oblivion in a world that despises those virtues.</p> <p>Nothing is ever likely again to restore Raphael to the status of a popular classic - but nor will the museums be taking his works off the walls any time soon because he is, like it or not, one of the supreme visual creators who ever lived.</p> <p>His art brings 200 years of experiment in Italy, since the time of Giotto, to a triumphant climax. His classicism is not chilly, either, but soulful - and if it comes easily and naturally to him, this does not mean there is not deep urgency and need in his pursuit of order.</p> <p>Raphael, son of an artist and intellectual at the court of Urbino, was orphaned, which must have deepened the appeal of an embracing divine order for him. He lived in violent times: his Entombment was commissioned to mourn a young man killed in the faction fights that plagued Perugia, its grief rendered more powerful, not less, by Raphael's disciplined aesthetic.</p> <p>He is great at painting action and danger - his fresco of the Fire in the Borgo is quoted by Picasso in Guernica. His paintings glow with the utopian ideals of the Renaissance.</p> <p>In a world that was still medieval, ridden by wars and plague and lacking basic medical knowledge, the dream of the ancient world that so moved Italians 500 years ago was at its root a belief that life could be made perfect: that streets could be open and airy, squares civic and peaceful.</p> <p>Raphael expresses this dream of the utopian city in his lovely early picture The Marriage of the Virgin, with its glorious open temple on a piazza, and perfects it in The School of Athens, which portrays ancient Greek philosophers in an architecture so lofty it looks like Mount Olympus.</p> <p>His eye for the basic and human never gets lost in the ideal. His Portrait of Julius II puts a human being before you as intensely as the Fayoum mummy portraits. His portraits are always like this - his imitation of the pose of the Mona Lisa in his picture of Maddalena Doni is touching because his sitter is so plainly real, a living woman, not Leonardo's dream.</p> <p>In his late work La Fornarina he portrays his own lover naked. But Raphael's art cannot be reduced to terms we find easier, such as those of realist art. His power and beauty lie in his exquisite yet robust balance of forces: a balance that comes of perfect calculation of colours, symmetry of volumes, sympathy of gestures.</p> <p>In other words, it can be said the distinction of Raphael really does lie in harmony, proportion and classicism - qualities that are as compelling in him as in Mozart, or a pine cone. (JJ)</p> <h2>Rapu Nui (Easter Island) (1000-1650) - Carved stone figures</h2> <p>Square-jawed and hollow-eyed, the massive moai statues that stand on Easter Island's windswept slopes have captured imaginations ever since Europeans \"discovered\" them in the 18th century.</p> <p>They were made as a ritual by the entire community for nearly 700 years, and then the cult collapsed, displaced by a new preoccupation with a birdman who incarnated the universal creator god.</p> <p>They brood on their lonely shore as if bleakly awaiting the end of time. (JJ)</p> <h2>Robert Rauschenberg - Bed (1955), Canyon (1955), Odalisk (1955-1958), Monogram (1955-1959)</h2> <p>The paint spattered like gore on Rauschenberg's Bed echoes the dripped and poured art of Jackson Pollock. Abstract expressionist painting was still new when Rauschenberg made the assemblages he called Combines in the 1950s, and he did not so much reject as complicate it.</p> <p>In Bed, the freedom and energy of slapdash painting is not abstract but tells a story: this is a bed he had slept on, and its painterly stains seem clues to something that happened in it. It's the scene of a crime.</p> <p>Rauschenberg's Combines tantalisingly mingle sensual, painterly painting with stuff collaged and assembled from found detritus.</p> <p>There is a pungent atmosphere of old, decaying junk to them, in among the sexual symbolism and expressive globs of paint. They have an intensity, a life, that easily places them among the most resonant art objects of the last 60 years. (JJ)</p> <h2>Man Ray - Compass (1920), Marcel Duchamp as Rrose S\u00e9lavy (1920-1921), Tears (1930-1932)</h2> <p>Man Ray, the first artist to imbue photography with a thoroughly surrealist aesthetic, experimented restlessly with technique, reviving solarisation, using superimposition, under- and overexposure, photograms, and shooting through filters. But he also produced some of the most dynamically glamorous images - especially in his fashion photography - and redefined the possibilities of photography.</p> <p>Compass, a photographic hybrid of still life and installation, shows a suspended magnet clutching to a pistol that threateningly points the way. His portrait of Duchamp as alias Rrose S\u00e9lavy - that's meant to sound like \"Eros, c'est la vie\" - subverts the young, supposedly revelatory tradition of photographic portraiture.</p> <p>Tears, meanwhile, is Ray in stylised glamour mode, with what looks like a silent screen starlet crying, and yet these are glass tears on a mannequin.</p> <p>Nothing is quite what it seems with Ray, and yet few photographers were ever so mesmerising. (EM)</p> <h2>Odilon Redon - Portrait of Gauguin (1903-5)</h2> <p>In Redon's art crisp symbols float in a perfumed mist - his homage to Gauguin is not a realistic portrait but a dreamlike elegy to this courageous artist's exotic soul.(JJ)</p> <h2>Rembrandt - Old Woman (The Artist's Mother) (c1629), The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp (1632), Saskia as Flora (1634), Self Portrait with Saskia (1635), Belshazzar's Feast (1635), The Blinding of Sampson (1636), Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb (1638), The Night Watch (1942), Aristotle with the Bust of Homer (1653), A Woman Bathing (1654), Jan Six (1654), The Polish Rider (1655), Self-Portrait, holding His Palette, Brushes and Maul Stick (c1663), The Jewish Bride (1667), Self-Portrait (1669)</h2> <p>The face of Rembrandt, from tousle-haired chubby boy, to the old man looking towards his own imminent death with one last spark of defiance, is more familiar than that of any of his contemporaries, because he created the record himself. It isn't in the handful of dull documents charting the arc of his life - a marriage, several mistresses, births, deaths, debts, a tangled estate - but in his own unparalleled series of self-portraits.</p> <p>We see Rembrandt as a gallant lad and a young married man, as an artisan holding the brushes and maul stick of his trade, as a prosperous (always a precarious state with Rembrandt) middle-aged man in splendid hat and furred robe. Finally, in a great last self-portrait painted within a few months of his death in 1669, like Prospero destroying his books, he has put aside the brushes from an earlier version, folded his hands, and waits for the end.</p> <p>Look at the left side of the face, and it's all gone - art, health, hope - but look to the right and that eyebrow is very slightly raised, the very corner of the lip slightly twitches, and just that one pinpoint of light remains defiant in the eye.</p> <p>He was only 23 when he painted the old woman now in the Royal Collection, long regarded as a portrait of his mother but probably just a study of old age to boast his prowess - and show wealthy patrons what he could do with their mothers or wives. The light is merciless, highlighting the pinched nose, sunken eyes and thin wrinkled lips - but she is no grotesque mocked by the young, but a figure full of calm assurance.</p> <p>Given a pretty model and a ravishing frock, Rembrandt could knock out a gorgeous goddess like Saskia seemingly smiling at her own grandeur. Take the frock away, and he could produce some of the most erotic nudes in art. He also left magnificent portraits of friends and patrons. More intriguing, however, are his dullest commissions, the group portraits where every man sharing the price of the picture wanted his own noble features immortalised. The Night Watch - a day watch before the varnish darkened - and The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp become gripping human dramas, angled to draw the viewer into the tangle of lances or the circle of dark figures around the bright stripped corpse.</p> <p>For most of his life Rembrandt was a jobbing artist, taking commissions where he could get them, teaching a garret full of young hopefuls, using some of the brighter pupils to fill up canvases and adding the killer details himself, usually short of money and sometimes bankrupt. And yet the paintings seem drenched in a wisdom and humanity quite unaccounted for by the banal details of his life.</p> <p>Museums with the great Rembrandts are used to visitors transfixed before the paintings, lost less in the technique or even the beauty than in a yearning for some profound truth that seems just out of reach. It's there less in the aghast faces at Belshazzar's Feast than in a shiver in the light. It's there in the 1654 woman paddling (probably his mistress Hendrickje Stoffels, who bore him a daughter that year) holding her shift to mid-thigh to keep it out of the water - not a nymph or a saint, nor a coquette giving the come-on to the watchers in the bushes or the viewer, just a woman pleasantly lost in her own private thoughts.</p> <p>At the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, staff gently move on visitors who have stopped dead in front of The Jewish Bride. It shows a sumptuously dressed couple, picked out in amber light from the dark enigmatic background, the man much older than the girl, her fingers barely tipping his hand curved protectively just below her breast. Nothing is certain about them: whether they represent a biblical scene, a double portrait or models in studio fancy dress. The title was attached centuries later. But whatever the relationship, it seems agonisingly intense: as in so many of his works, a silence frozen, which must be broken by one of them speaking and revealing... something. (MK)</p> <h2>Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Dance at La Moulin Galette (1876)</h2> <p>The light that flickers across the faces and bodies of the young people at an open-air dance - brightly chancing on straw boaters, beer glasses, a stripy dress - shocked the first people who saw it. In that fragmenting movement of light, which makes painting itself visible between the world and the eye, they rightly glimpsed the impending modernist attack on pictorial comfort. (JJ)</p> <h2>Gerhard Richter - October 18th, 1977 (1988)</h2> <p>The faces of the Baader Meinhof terrorists dead in prison, their cells, their funeral, all blurred and grey in these works based on photographs, are terrible and sad in a shocking cycle of modern history paintings.(JJ)</p> <h2>Bridget Riley - Fission (1963)</h2> <p>Bridget Riley's early Op art paintings seemed to hum and buzz with electric energy. In the distortions of black dots and lines, she created optical illusions so that the surface of the paintings seem to be folding or opening, as if the viewer could dive into them. (JL)</p> <h2>Diego Rivera - The Mexican War of Independence (1929-1935)</h2> <p>The flamboyant Marxist painter Diego Rivera was the leader of the Mexican mural movement that sought to bring art to the masses through large-scale public works. This celebratory piece expounds the might of a united people. (JL)</p>",
  "<h2>Nam June Paik - Electronic Superhighway: Continental US, Alaska, Hawaii (1995)</h2> <p>The South-Korean born Nam June Paik was considered to be the first video artist, and developed the idea of an electronic superhighway in 1974. This 49-channel closed-circuit video installation is Paik's retort to America's obsession with television, the moving image and all things bright and shiny. (JL)</p> <h2>Paleolithic art - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/29/paleolithic-art\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Samuel Palmer - The Sketchbook of 1824, Early Morning (1825)</h2> <p>William Blake's rurally inclined friend, Palmer created some of the most seductive images of the English countryside. The subjects tend towards the predictably idyllic: the sentimentality of fly-free picnics, reclining poets and the dignity of the farmer's lot. Yet Palmer's delineation of infinite natural variety raises the atmosphere to visionary heights. The sketchbook, an extraordinary document of almost unhinged passion for nature, contains surely the most uncanny drawing of a donkey in all art history. Every patterned texture of Early Morning comes across as if swarming with organic energy. (RC)</p> <h2>Parmigianino - Self-Portrait in a Mirror (1524)Madonna of the Long Neck (1534-1539)</h2> <p>To draw his own portrait Parmigianino has looked into a convex mirror, and his painting is a simulacrum of that mirror - a round picture in which we see a distorted room, with the artist's drawing hand huge in the foreground.</p> <p>These kinds of daring surprises are typical of the style called mannerism that developed in Italy as soon as the Renaissance ideals of proportion and perspective had been achieved; distortion, as in Parmigianino's Madonna of the Long Neck, was now the only way now for young artists to go. (JJ)</p> <h2>Martin Parr - New Brighton (1983-1986)</h2> <p>At the time, Martin Parr's series of photographs from New Brighton, a dilapidated seaside spot on the Wirral, were attacked as condescending. But now they look humorously engaged and fond, bringing British working-class nooks and crannies into view, and reminding us how unusual that was (and is) in art photography. (EM)</p> <h2>Vong Phaophanit - Neon Rice Field (1993)</h2> <p>Laos-born Vong Phaophanit was nominated for the Turner prize in 1993, and the work he created for the exhibition, Neon Rice Field, consisted of undulating lines of rice lit from beneath, emitting a seductive glow. Phaophanit's installations meditate on the transience of life, memory and loss. (JL)</p> <h2>Pheidias (and workshop?) - Parthenon frieze (c440BC-435BC)</h2> <p>A masterpiece of fluid, beautifully composed sculpture, the \"Elgin marbles\" ran in a 160m ribbon around the Parthenon. The frieze depicts a procession with horses and sacrificial animals culminating in a rather opaque religious ritual.</p> <p>Though it is one of the most celebrated artworks in the world, the first guidebook to Greece, written in the second century, didn't even mention it. (CH)</p> <h2>Philippines (19th century - Angular wooden figure from northern Luzon </h2> <p>This little black wooden figure, depicted clasping its knees, was once part of a collection owned by the French surrealists Andr\u00e9 Breton and Paul Eluard. The mystery as to the precise origin of it remains, yet it is believed to be from the Ifugao people, who lived in the northern highlands of the Philippines. (JL)</p> <h2>Pablo Picasso - Absinthe Drinker (1901), Portrait of Gertrude Stein (1906), Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Brick Factory at Tortosa (1909), Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1910), Woman with a Guitar, (Ma Jolie) (1911-1912), Guitar (1912), Three Musicians (1921), Seated Harlequin (1923), Three Dancers (1925), Young Woman in Front of a Mirror (1932), Vollard Suite (1933), Guernica (1937), Weeping Woman (1937), Self-Portrait (1972)</h2> <p>The only reason to deny the title of the greatest artist who ever lived to Pablo Picasso would be a feeling, deep down, that he is less emotionally profound than, say, a Rembrandt or a Goya. And this suspicion would arise from the very thing that makes him so dazzling - his formal inventiveness. Picasso created entirely new visual languages, abandoned them, invented new ones, returned to his previous ideas in new ways, in a flow of creative ecstasy that only faltered late in his long life - and even when the stream mellowed it was still his.</p> <p>There is a joy in life in Picasso's art that defies both the melancholy of his Spanish heritage and the sophistication of his adopted Paris. Perhaps the best place to begin, for anyone who wants to look at Picasso afresh and get the measure of his extraordinary talent, is to look at his series of etchings created in the 1930s for the legendary art dealer Ambroise Vollard: the bold, clear line in which Picasso can draw is as perfect as Raphael's but he does not rest on that perfection - not for a second. He invades it with a stormburst of violent forms: bulls gore horses in the arena, monsters appear to young girls, lovers crush one another as the god of styles plays at will with cubism, surrealism, classicism.</p> <p>By the time Picasso etched the Vollard Suite he could draw on vast experiences and achievements. Recognised as a genius in childhood (here was not an artist who had to wait for recognition) he chose the tough life of the avant-garde, in Barcelona and Montmartre, living in poverty, painting his Blue Period laments - the first, brilliantly sentimental evidence of the social and political compassion that accompanies his creative urge. With Georges Braque, he embarked on his experiment in cubism, the total dismantling of western art's pictorial tradition: his cubist paintings demonstrate that experience is infinitely stranger and more complex than anything that can be simplified into a neatly organised picture. From now on, no visual appearance is taken for granted by Picasso. Everything is pulled apart and remade - he touches things with his eye, and gives them to you to touch as well.</p> <p>No view of Picasso as an artist who rapidly declined or jumped about too much holds up to the testament of his art. The point about Guernica, the great history painting he made in a rage of compassion and solidarity with the Basque town bombed by the German air force during the Spanish civil war, is that it is a natural development from mythological scenes he'd been imagining in the 30s under the influence of surrealism and his own dark side. It is, as a humane statement about war, unmatched in art.</p> <p>This account began by wondering if Picasso might be denied the title of the world's greatest artist because he seems to lack the spirtuality of a Rembrandt, the truth of a Goya. He doesn't have \"soul\", that's true, because he was an atheist. But his late Self-Portrait is no less moving for that. As for truth, as for humanity, as for the full translation of life as he knew it into art - who ever did anything like as much? He matches the genius of High Renaissance masters, yet also lets the brutal savage energy of real life into the studio. The science in cubism outstrips Leonardo's researches. What other artist in history can really compare to the greatest of them all? (JJ)</p> <h2>Giovanni Battista Piranesi - Imaginary Prisons (1750)</h2> <p>Piranesi's etchings pictured Kafkaesque architectural complexes almost two centuries before The Castle and The Trial were written. With an incisive command of suspenseful stage management, Piranesi sets up doors that open onto nightmare precipices and stairways that end in mid-air nowhere. A vertiginous psycho-architecture. (RC)</p> <h2>Antonio Pisanello - St George and the Princess (c1437-8)</h2> <p>The chivalrous dreams of the middle ages are given a reality and substance by new ways of making figures solid and portraits lifelike in Pisanello's art. His St George is an Arthurian knight in a deeply compelling landscape. (JJ)</p> <h2>Nicola and Giovanni Pisano - Pulpits (13th/early 14th century)</h2> <p>The heroic forms that swarm these precocious works of medieval sculpture, inspired by ancient Roman sarcophagi that can still be seen today in Pisa's Campo Santo, anticipate and influenced the Renaissance recovery of the classical nude. (JJ)</p> <h2>Camille Pissarro- The Red Roofs (1877)</h2> <p>The village houses glimpsed through winter trees, their russet rooftops and pale walls tantalising and moving - who lives there? - show how much C\u00e9zanne owed to Pissarro, in whose hands impressionism is a sombre rustic art. (JJ)</p> <h2>Sigmar Polke - Children's Games (1988), Cook Up Art with a Culinary Flair (2002)</h2> <p>Polke went from ironically paying tribute to consumer hotdogs, as a kind of eastern bloc Pop artist, to conjuring some of the most contagiously gripping chemically tinged hallucinations of our time. His Ben-day dots tend to be painstakingly hand-painted. His dream images overlap and cross-associate. The unnerving tension of these two works lies in their thematic ambivalence, hinting simultaneously at things both dreadful and intoxicating, world-weariness and playful innocence. No one else comes near Polke's sophisticated orchestration of unease. (RC)</p> <h2>Jackson Pollock - Guardians of the Secret (1943), The She-Wolf (1943), Full Fathom Five (1947), Alchemy (1947), Number I, 1948 (1948), Autumn Rhythm (1950), Lavender Mist (1950), One: Number 31, 1950 (1950), Blue Poles (1952), The Deep (1953)</h2> <p>The moving thing about the man who \"broke the ice\" for modern art in America is the contrast between his hugely painful, thwarted life and the almost miraculous grace he briefly achieved in his art. What makes this one of art's great and mysterious stories is the clarity with which you can see this heroic tale in Pollock's own paintings, even if you knew nothing of his biography.</p> <p>To look at one of his early paintings like Guardians of the Secret is to see the frustrations of a flawed artist and the unconcealed anguish of a perplexed human being. He imagines \"guardians\", powerful and remote Others, holding up a picture he can't decode, a \"secret\" he dearly wishes admission to - a key to art and life he does not possess. The style of the painting reveals the problems that keep him out of their club: it is manifestly derivative from Picasso.</p> <p>In the 1940s New York was where European modern artists in flight from occupied France found refuge. Pollock was one of a generation of ambitious American painters, schooled in hard knocks by the Depression, who were desperate to emulate them. He was also an alcoholic with serious problems. But in 1943, the year he painted Guardians of the Secret, the collector Peggy Guggenheim started paying him monthly. His wife, the artist Lee Krasner, helped him stop drinking and, working in a converted barn at their refuge of a home on Long Island, he found a way to paint that transfigured the dream art of the surrealists into something new and marvellous.</p> <p>Pollock's version of abstract art is the most exhilarating of the 20th century - more gutsy and alive than the spiritual art of Mondrian, Kandinsky or Malevich - and it gave later artists a lesson in freedom.</p> <p>After this, artists could do anything. What Pollock did was to lay out huge rolls of canvas on the ground and throw, flick, pour and dribble paint on them: like a cowboy throwing out a lassoo, said his champion, the critic Clement Greenberg.</p> <p>Pollock's method was wild - but he was in control of it. \"No chaos, damn it!\" he insisted. In his supreme works - the three cosmic abstractions of 1950 divided today between America's three greatest museums - he attains a harmony in freedom that is simply overwhelmingly beautiful and grand: a vision of an art and a life that might be, an improvised utopia, like a sax solo in paradise. You see something limitless and infinite in this art - and then the door closes. Pollock hit the bottle again. His personality crumbled. His last works are romantic ruins. (JJ)</p> <h2>Pontormo - Deposition (c1526-8), Portrait of a Halberdier (1529)</h2> <p>The fragile coloured forms wafting in the violet air of Pontormo's incredible Deposition are \"bodies\" only in the most perfunctory sense: the people grieving for Christ in their cascade of red and pink and blue draperies that crinkle like cr\u00eape paper in the picture's shallow box are creatures of pure emotion, enfleshed by colour.</p> <p>His young soldier is tenderly portrayed in his idealism and good looks - fodder for the cannon. (JJ)</p> <h2>Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia Ego (late 1630s), Landscape with a Man Killed by Snake (1648), Self-Portrait (1650), Blind Orion Searching for the Rising Sun (1656), A Dance to the Music of Time (date unknown)</h2> <p>Poussin was a great landscape artist, but painting views with topographical accuracy was not the point.</p> <p>These are enchanted environments, depicted with a balance of composition that makes them seem otherworldly. The subjects, too, are not of our time and place, often referring to classical literature, as in Et in Arcadia Ego, in which nymphs and shepherds straight out of Virgil's Eclogues curiously investigate a tomb and come face to face with mortality.</p> <p>Or the utterly strange and bewitching Blind Orion, in which the giant hunter of mythology, having been blinded, seeks the rays of the sun, which will restore his sight. Death, too, interrupts the Landscape with a Man Killed by Snake: in the foreground a python-like creature overcomes a man, and fear seems to fan out from him, affecting the figures towards the background each in turn.</p> <p>Sometimes Poussin is regarded as a \"difficult\" painter, appreciation of whom is supposedly dependent on an encylopedic knowledge of ancient literature, philosophy, and the Bible, not to mention 17th-century French politics. That is to underestimate the pleasure of simply encountering and enjoying the poetry of his subjects and the harmony of his compositions.</p> <p>C\u00e9zanne took inspiration from the disposition of his landscapes.

  "<p>Tom Megahy, who has died aged 79, will be remembered as a man of principle who never wavered from his socialist beliefs. Born in a Lanarkshire mining village, he left school at 14 to become a railway signalman and rose to be a Labour MEP and, from 1987 until 1989, vice-president of the European parliament.</p> <p>In 1953, Tom won a trade union scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, where he and Bill (now Lord) McCarthy became the first student team to win the Observer Mace debating contest. Shortly afterwards Tom was struck down with polio, but did not let the consequent disability stand in the way of his political career. </p> <p>He moved to Mirfield, Yorkshire, and with the reorganisation of local government in 1972 was elected as the first leader of Kirklees council. He succeeded in the difficult task of welding together a new council comprising Huddersfield and Dewsbury, when neither wanted to work together. For this he was appointed MBE.</p> <p>In 1979, Tom was elected in the first direct elections to the European parliament, staying until retirement in 1999, and becoming chairman of the British Labour group. He was respected for his fairness and ability to see both sides of any argument. Meetings were always greatly enlivened by his sense of humour and sharp wit.</p> <p>Elected on the Labour party policy of \"withdrawal from the Common Market\", he always supported this policy and campaigned vehemently against Neil Kinnock's move to change it. In spite of that, he worked hard to help construct a social side to the economic community, being instrumental in the drafting of the 1993 European working time directive. His walking disability inspired him to work hard to establish a disability card that was accepted throughout the EU.</p> <p>Tom spent many years as a member of the legal affairs committee, and when he retired as an MEP in 1999, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of civil law from Huddersfield University.</p> <p>He always kept his desire to work for people in the Dewsbury area, where he had lived for most of his adult life, never losing his common touch or forgetting his working-class roots. A Labour party stalwart, he was always the optimist. For him the glass was ever half full, never half empty. He is survived by his wife Jean, and three sons, Ian, Robin and Alastair.</p>",
  "<p>In 2004, a young offender on early release threatened to cave my head in and bury both my parents. After this incident, a close friend advised me: \"If you work with people with challenging behaviour, expect challenging behaviour.\" Harsh but helpful words when things don't go according to plan. </p> <p>My latest visit to Ashfield young offenders' institution couldn't have been more different from the first. I said to some of the mentoring staff I reckoned it had something to do with the full moon; I got a mixed, eyebrow-raised response. </p> <p>The young offenders (lads) were literally bouncing off the walls. Some were unable or unwilling to sit in their seats for more than 30 seconds; some stared vacantly at blank sheets of paper unable to think of what to write in their latest diaries. \"Nothing's happened this week, boss, got nothing to write.\" Staff reply: \"You told me you lost it on Monday and tried to set fire to your cell. That's a start isn't it?\" The same lad came up to me later and said he felt like he was losing his mind but that the diary writing had seriously helped. He then sat down and started to write. </p> <p>Two lads almost got into a fight right in front of me when some harmless messing got personal and out of control. My teaching partner in crime, Marcel, quickly calmed them down like it was all part of the job \u2013 it is. I was impressed. It was as if the first four days of intensive workshops I'd run had never happened and we were starting from scratch. I felt downhearted and my energy hit the floor. Then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/audio/2008/oct/15/youth-justice1\">Dingle</a> walked into the class, late, holding a plastered index finger up to me. \"Look at that, boss! Got a blister from writing so damn hard!\" Dingle is in the painful process of toughening up his finger skin so he can write even harder. It looked nasty but I was made up.</p> <p>This kind of work has a lot to do with group dynamics. Finding a navigable path through complex human behaviour is often tricky. I'm good at group work but I'm better one to one. As a result, I've decided to steer the workshops in this direction. In the last wall-bouncing session, when we finally got them to calm down, split up and write, I was able to speak to them individually. The difference in their communication with me was dramatic. When they're not distracted with verbal or physical sparring, the lads appear to respect me, listen to me and, when their best mate isn't sticking a pen in their ribs, more than capable of following instructions. </p> <p>The success of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic/2008/oct/15/write-to-freedom\">article in the Guardian launching Write to Freedom (WTF)</a> on October 15 quickly became clear. The prison staff and lads were made up with the high profile, and within a couple of hours of the article being printed BBC Radio Bristol were on their way to the prison to interview Dingle and 'Toothless'. Both lads spoke amazingly well. Hearing what effect the project is already having on them pretty much moved me to tears.</p> <p>The WTF lads are working weekly with their assigned mentors, are designing the WTF logo and the WTF website is being built. </p> <p>Their time in session last Friday with Marcel wasn't punctuated by the sound of mickey-taking and non-stop talking. Marcel told me all he could hear was the click clack of focused, diary-writing fingers on PC keyboards. It seems the full moon has finally released our lads from its insane grip. They're back on track writing for and about their lives. </p> <p><strong>Young offender profile: 'Toothless'</strong><br>Toothless has a broad grin with a removable tooth and a trickster glint in his eyes. He is fully committed to Write to Freedom and surprisingly good at writing about his life, experience and hope for his future. He has an ability to express his emotions and ideas clearly and with humour; much more so than me at times. He was invited along to the first staff training day and presented his version of what we'd done in the workshops so far with cheek and confidence. If he can stay out of trouble this lad will go far.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.casparwalsh.co.uk\">Caspar Walsh</a>'s prison memoir, Criminal, is out in paperback on Thursday, published by Headline</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, the great, sparkling, global advert for Britain is, it seems, a standard-bearer for our deeply unequal society too. The pressure group Fair Pay Network is campaigning for Premier League clubs to pay \"a living wage\" to their programme sellers, cleaners and catering staff following a survey which found many of them were being paid the minimum wage of \u00a35.52 per hour; in the organisation's words, \"the lowest wage it is legally acceptable to pay\". </p> <p>This in a sport which pays its top star players a reported \u00a3160,000 a week, and bumper pay packages to directors - over \u00a31m a year for the chief executives of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and the Premier League itself, Richard Scudamore. </p> <p>Fair Pay Network cites research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that \u00a35.52 an hour is not enough to live decently on; it leaves people in real, material poverty, and the network argues an hourly wage of \u00a37.45 in London, \u00a36.80 outside the capital, is the minimum necessary for a single person. The organisation found that many jobs advertised at Premier League clubs, often by companies contracted to provide catering at the grounds, were paying the minimum wage. Some were for people to serve in corporate hospitality areas, which, famously, symbolise the \"prawn sandwich\" culture of wealth at the top clubs. </p> <p>One advert for a kitchen porter to work at Heathcote's at Anfield, the fine-dining end of Liverpool's matchday experience, specified the wage was the legal minimum, \u00a35.52 per hour. An applicant for a job at Manchester United Conference and Banqueting was told the pay was: \"Dependent on area of work. However, most areas will follow the national minimum wage of \u00a35.52 per hour.\" </p> <p>Vacancies at Fulham this summer for people to serve food and drink from kiosks at the ground were advertised via an agency at \u00a36 an hour, while Spurs were looking for warehouse staff in their merchandise division to work for \u00a35.75 an hour. At Chelsea, owned by the Russian oligarch billionaire Roman Abramovich, Fair Pay Network found catering jobs being offered below the living wage. </p> <p>\"It is offensive,\" says Mark Donne, Fair Pay Network's director. \"Football must be one of the most unequal industries we have: an extremely wealthy sport with people servicing it who are living in working poverty.\"</p> <p>Last week the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote to Abramovich at Chelsea and to Arsenal, Tottenham, Fulham and West Ham saying \"concerns have been raised with me about low-paid workers at London's five Premier League clubs\", calling on them to pay a \"living wage\". In a policy begun by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, all Greater London Authority staff are paid at least the \u00a37.45 an hour \"London Living Wage\". Johnson argues, as does Fair Pay Network, that the clubs would themselves benefit if they paid more, because their staff would be more motivated and loyal.</p> <p>\"London's football clubs are an integral part of the social fabric of this city,\" Johnson wrote, \"the values they stand for and actions they take have a huge influence on millions of people.</p> <p>\"It would set a superb example for your club to agree to pay your low-paid workers - shop assistants, catering staff and cleaners - the London Living Wage, and I urge you to do so.\"</p> <p>The sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, also supports the living wage campaign, on the same basis: that the football clubs, so rich and bearing the names of their towns and cities, would set a notable example for decent pay to the country at large. No clubs, however, have yet committed to paying the \"living wage\", although Fair Pay Network says it is having positive discussions with Aston Villa and is hopeful that Villa will become the first.</p> <p>In response to the survey and campaign, the Premier League, speaking on the clubs' behalf, pointed to the \"substantial contribution\" the clubs make to the economy and pay in tax, and said: \"The clubs respect all the relevant employment laws.\" A spokesman suggested that if the government believes the minimum wage should be higher, it should pass a law to that effect: \"Statutory pay levels are a matter for government,\" he said. \"Perhaps this would be the most appropriate place for the Fair Pay Network to concentrate their campaign efforts.\"</p> <p>Scudamore himself, in a letter earlier this month to Alan Keen MP, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Football Group, wrote that clubs do not have a problem recruiting at even the lowest-paid levels:</p> <p>\"In general clubs receive many applications for the available jobs, suggesting that terms and conditions are relatively attractive compared to other employment opportunities.\"</p> <p>Scudamore was paid a basic salary of \u00a3590,000 in the year to July 31 2007. He also received a bonus of \u00a3410,000 because of the television deals he secured for the clubs. In addition, \u00a3213,000 was paid into his pension, making his total remuneration \u00a31.2m. Sir Dave Richards, the Premier League's part-time chairman and only other director, was paid \u00a3261,000 for what the league says is a three-day week. </p> <p>The pay of Premier League directors (see below), which increased substantially at most clubs between 2006 and 2007 - and is likely to go up again because of the bigger, \u00a32.7bn TV deal which began last season - is mostly a great deal higher than the pay of directors at general companies with similar-sized turnovers. Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's chief executive, was the Premier League boardroom's highest earner on \u00a31.9m, followed by Manchester United's David Gill on \u00a31.48m, Liverpool's Rick Parry on \u00a31.12m, and Arsenal's managing director, Keith Edelman, whose total pay was \u00a31.056m in the 12 months to May 31 this year. </p> <p>According to the Chartered Management Institute, companies in the \"Big Four\" bracket, turning over between \u00a3100m and \u00a3249m annually, pay their chief executives on average \u00a3650,000. Spurs were the only other club which turned over more than \u00a3100m; chairman, Daniel Levy, was paid \u00a3950,000, an 18% increase on his 2006 pay packet of \u00a3775,000. </p> <p>Below those top clubs, chief executives' pay was still mostly higher than at non-football companies with similar turnover - and startlingly high for the best-paid directors at Sunderland, \u00a31.06m, and Portsmouth, \u00a3907,175. Neither club identified which director had been paid those packages, and Sunderland declined to discuss the disparity between the highest-paid millionaire director and the wages of the lowest paid at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>Sources at some clubs justified the chief executives' pay by arguing that while it looks glamorous and enjoyable, the job is high pressure and demands a wide range of skills which only a few people have. </p> <p>A Manchester United spokesman said of the gap between Gill's salary and the minimum wage catering jobs: \"We are a global business and the challenge David Gill has in managing that is bigger than in an average \u00a3210m turnover business. But at all levels, people want to work for Manchester United. We pay the market rate for both jobs.\"</p> <p>Football, the national game, has always held a mirror to the nation. </p> <p><em>To read a copy of Boris Johnson's letter to London's Premier League chairmen, click <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Football/documents/2008/10/28/JohnsonLetter.pdf\">here</a>.

  "<p>The proliferation of ever larger centralised databases is increasing the risk of people's personal data being lost or abused, the government's official privacy watchdog claims today.</p> <p>The warning from the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, comes as he discloses that reported data losses have soared in the past year.</p> <p>The number of data breaches - including lost laptops and memory sticks containing sensitive personal records - reported to him has risen to 277 since the loss of 25 million child benefit records was disclosed nearly a year ago.</p> <p>The new figures show that the information commissioner has recently launched investigations into 30 of the most serious cases. The 277 breaches include 80 reported by the private sector, 75 within the NHS and other health bodies, 28 reported by central government, 26 by local authorities and 47 by the rest of the public sector.</p> <p>\"It is alarming that despite high-profile data losses, the threat of enforcement action, a plethora of reports on data handling and clear information commission guidance, the flow of data breaches and sloppy information handling continues,\" Thomas says in a speech today.</p> <p>His warning follows an admission yesterday by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, that the technical work on creating a giant centralised database of all email, text, phone and web traffic will go ahead despite the fact that ministers have decided to delay the legislation needed to set it up and instead put the proposal out to consultation.</p> <p>The information commissioner says that data losses have already led to fake credit card transactions, witnesses at risk of physical harm or intimidation, offenders at risk from vigilantes, falsified land registry records and mortgage fraud: \"Addresses of service personnel, police and prison officers and battered women have also been exposed. Sometimes lives may be at risk.\"</p> <p>Thomas acknowledges that the rise in the number of breaches reported to him may be because of improved checks and audits as a welcome result of organisations taking data security more seriously.</p> <p>He says: \"More laptops have been encrypted and thousands of staff have been trained. But the number of breaches notified to us must still be well short of the total. How many PCs and laptops are junked with live data? How many staff do not tell their managers when they have lost a memory stick, laptop or disk?\"</p> <p>The information commissioner warns that as new technology is harnessed to collect vast amounts of personal information, the risks of it being abused increase: \"It is time for the penny to drop. The more databases that are set up and the more information exchanged from one place to another, the greater the risk of something going wrong. </p> <p>\"The more you centralise data collection, the greater the risk of multiple records going missing or wrong decisions about real people being made.\"</p> <p>His warning follows an admission yesterday by Jacqui Smith that the technical work on creating a giant centralised database of all email, text, phone and web traffic will go ahead, despite the fact that ministers have decided to delay the legislation needed to set it up and instead put the proposal out to consultation.</p> <p>The home secretary yesterday defended the idea of a huge new database when she appeared before parliament's human rights committee, telling MPs and peers that 95% of security and organised crime investigations since 2004 had made considerable use of communications data. \"It is fundamentally important to ensure that convictions are secured. We face a fundamental change in the way that technology is going in relationship to communications data,\" she said, arguing that without such a database, one of the most important tools for law enforcement agencies was likely to be eroded.</p> <p>Her insistence that the technical work in Whitehall - known as the interception modernisation programme - will continue while consultation takes place on the project next year follows criticism from the director of public prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, who warned that the government was in danger of \"breaking the back of freedom\" by the relentless pressure of a security state.</p> <p>The home secretary refused to respond to the DPP's criticism yesterday, apart from observing that he had not made such comments in cross-government talks on the project.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339089958\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/28/data-security-breaches-460.jpg\" alt=\"Data security breaches\" width=\"460\" height=\"198\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>The recent economic turmoil has rocked the world's financial markets, triggering a rise in unemployment and a plunge in bank shares. One beneficiary, though, may be the growing army of freelance senior executives working in the public and voluntary sectors. </p> <p>There is confidence in the industry that any financial squeeze on budgets and pay in the public and voluntary sectors will bring more work opportunities for these highly skilled and specialist managers. The common view is that there will be an even greater demand for experienced executives brought in on short-term contracts to deliver results - especially if they bring improved efficiency and find cash savings. </p> <p>There are estimated to be around 5,000 interim managers in the UK. It is becoming a profession in its own right and a career of choice. Nearly one-third of interims last year worked on special projects, another 19% on issues around human resources and 14% on finance, according to figures from the Interim Management Association, the organisation for specialist agencies that supply interim managers. </p> <p>Twenty years ago the typical interim would have been a man in his mid- to late-50s seeking to step down as he looked towards retirement. Today, while an interim is still likely to be male, he is more often in his mid-40s from a public or private sector background aiming to build a career around a variety of challenging short-term contracts. And nowadays more of these contracts are being placed in the public and voluntary sectors.</p> <p><strong>Increased demand</strong></p> <p>In the past year the public sector saw a 30% increase in interim manager assignments, according to specialist interim management agencies. The biggest demand - around one-third - came from central government, followed by local authorities and then the NHS. This increase is also reflected in figures from OGCbuyingsolutions - the Treasury agency responsible for the list of \"approved suppliers\" or contractors to work in the public sector. Interim management contracts placed through the agency in the last financial year were worth \u00a355m and are expected to reach \u00a370m in 2008 to 2009 - a rise of 34%. </p> <p>Gary Lawson, director of public sector interims at Russam GMS, a government-approved interim manager supplier, says: \"The current spend in the public sector is protected until the end of next March and it is then that we will see what the fall-out is from the current financial conditions. My view is that the areas which will suffer will be those which don't offer the public sector some kind of improvement or efficiency.\" </p> <p>The demand for interims in the public sector is expected to rise as it turns to short-term contacts to help reduce staff costs, confirms OGCbuyingsolutions. It reveals the use of interims has risen as contracts for management consultants have fallen. </p> <p>Interims can achieve quick results because they can step away from office politics which can sometimes distract permanent members of staff, says Martin Dorchester, an interim manager for more than a decade with experience in the public and private sectors. \"Interims aren't encumbered with corporate baggage, they aren't going to spend their time trying to develop their future career prospects with the client.\" </p> <p>Paul Vousden, a founding member of the Institute of Interim Management, the professional organisation for interim managers with 200 members, agrees. \"You bring a fresh pair of eyes. Some people say they feel squeezed if an interim comes in, but they shouldn't - we aren't after their job.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Citywest Homes got \u00a335m from the government this year it went from being an organisation with little history to having the biggest development programme of any landlord of its type. </p> <p>An arms's length management organisation (Almo), Citywest manages council homes for Westminster city council and now, after a change in the government's rules, it gets grants to build them too. </p> <p>It needed to set up a development department to oversee the building programme - and fast - so it bought in interim manager Richard Birchett. He got the department going and the developments off the ground. That meant liaising with local communities, architects and developers while ensuring that the council provided the funding necessary for work to commence. \"It's the Almo with the biggest affordable housing programme on the planet, so that's pretty exciting,\" he says.</p> <p>Birchett has been an interim manager for five years, after a 25-year career in council housing departments, latterly as head of housing for North Lincolnshire.</p> <p>Interims are especially popular in areas of housing undergoing big changes - project managers are needed to steer mergers between housing associations, and asset management experts help landlords upgrade their homes to the government's decent homes standard. </p> <p>A year ago, following funding cuts, people who could help housing associations sell off supported housing were in demand, although this has died down. The emphasis now is on experts who can tell landlords how to save money or prepare for inspections.</p> <p>Recruitment agencies say demand from clients for interim managers remains steady, although fewer development staff are wanted because building projects have been hit by the property slump. They say more interims are coming onto their books after redundancies in the private construction sector and from consolidating housing associations and consultancies. Others have reached the top of their career ladder and want a change.</p> <p>Most agencies say interims need senior level experience in housing. \"I think that is understandable because people want interims to hit the ground running,\" says Marina Turner, who runs Tribal Resourcing's interim business. Martin Smith, local government consultant at interim provider Penna, says interims in finance and human resources can come from private or other public sector backgrounds but housing management experts need a housing background. </p> <p>Anaya Castell, who set up the interim management service at Insight HR and Management Consultancy, says interims need nine years' experience at the level they plan to work at, as well as project experience, the ability to meet tight deadlines and good communication skills. \"If people think you might axe their jobs, or there are management or board problems, you need to communicate without putting people's noses out of joint,\" she says.</p> <p>The amount clients pay an agency for an interim varies according to the location, length and difficulty of the assignment, the size of the organisation, the seniority of the role and the individual interim. A director of housing at a large inner-London council or a big housing association might receive between \u00a3700 and \u00a3900 per day or \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 at a smaller organisation.</p> <p>Some may blanche at the size of the fees but Birchett points out that interims are not paid if they are ill or on holiday. Castell says the added experience interims bring can save organisations money which could more than cancel out the day rate.</p> <p>Demand for interims and the fees they command reflect changes in housing and the economy. But with landlords facing an onslaught of change, there's no shortage of work for the interims who guide them.</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Tribal Resourcing interim provider: <a href=\"http://www.tribalresourcing.com\">tribalresourcing.com</a></p> <p>Penna interim provider: <a href=\"http://www.penna.com/interim\">penna.com/interim</a></p> <p>Insight HR: <a href=\"http://insight-hr.co.uk/interim_management.asp?ID=8\">insight-hr.co.uk/interim_management.asp?ID=8</a></p>",
  "<p>In the name of \"modernisation\", the government has insisted on competitive commissioning, a narrow focus on financial efficiency savings, and investment through the private finance initiative (PFI) that builds up long-term debts. It has shown a strong preference for large, aggregated contracts. In other words, public services have been subject to the same blind faith in market forces as the rest of the economy.</p> <p>The failure of unregulated markets will take a double toll on public services. A recession means fewer taxes to pay the bills. And the market \"rules\" that have been reshaping the public sector now threaten their long-term viability. </p> <p>But crisis brings opportunity. Public services will have to find new ways to create real value. One way is to develop service models that deliver multiple benefits in the short term, and build future resilience. There are plenty of examples that show how this could be done. Here are four:</p> <p>\u2022 Devon county council put out a tender for waste and recycling and awarded the contract to a locally based charity rather than to one of the multinational companies that had put in a bid. Mid-Devon Community Recycling provides voluntary placements and employs people with disabilities. It helps people to come off benefits and find work. This way, it reduces the bills for financial support and for health and social care that would otherwise fall to central and local government.</p> <p>\u2022 In London, Camden council commissioned the Holy Cross Centre Trust to provide a mental health daycare service. The trust works with those who use the service and with local volunteers, actively encouraging them to design and deliver their own activities and programmes, to support each other. This \"co-production\" model has at least two advantages. By treating people as assets rather than as problems, it taps into resources that would otherwise not be available - such as time, energy, wisdom, experience, and the wealth of human relationships - to enhance and safeguard mental wellbeing. By strengthening social networks and giving people more control over their lives, it helps to prevent problems and needs that would otherwise generate demands for services. </p> <p>\u2022 Shaftesbury Young People in London and Bryn Melyn Ltd in Wales are two small providers offering high quality, stable, residential care for young people. Interventions like these are not the cheapest, but they create significant long-term value by, for example, reducing the likelihood of young people using drugs or living on the streets. An analysis of these types of therapeutic, preventative provision by the New Economics Foundation (Nef), if scaled up to the residential care population as a whole, would save the exchequer \u00a3700m. Yet the current focus on market forces is pushing providers like these out of business.</p> <p>\u2022 The NHS trusts in Cornwall work together on sustainable food procurement, with a combined food budget of more than \u00a31.5m a year. They want high-quality food for patients, staff and visitors, and they try to spend the money in Cornwall and the south-west in order to improve the wealth and the social and physical health of the local community - as well as cutting food miles. They have placed business with local suppliers for sandwiches, fruit and vegetables, cheese and ice cream. They aim to source local food and employ local labour, providing meals for all healthcare establishments in Cornwall.</p> <p>These examples have key features in common. They target spending so that public money circulates locally for longer. They help to build local economic resilience, strengthening skills and knowledge at the local level, and creating employment. They seek to maintain wellbeing and thereby safeguard resources for meeting needs that cannot be avoided. They invest in ways of working that are designed to achieve at least two positive outcomes for the price of one.</p> <p>Together, they suggest how public bodies can create real value for people over time, instead of ruthlessly pursuing the shortsighted goals of bigger-is-better and more-for-less. Nef has developed models for procurement and commissioning that support this different approach. These models acknowledge the importance of spending public money in ways that deliver social, environmental and economic benefits, assessing performance according to this \"triple bottom line\". We know how to do it, and we know it can work. Camden council has already announced plans to use the sustainable commissioning model across its Supporting People and social services' contracts, worth in the region of \u00a330m over the next two years. The challenge now is to turn the exception into the rule, moving beyond discredited market solutions to strengthen communities and economies, to build resilience locally, and to promote sustainable wellbeing.</p> <p>\u2022 Josh-Ryan Collins works on sustainable procurement and commissioning at Nef.

  "<p>The existing system for approving or turning down major infrastructure projects such as runways, ports and power stations is far from perfect, but it has long been based on the public inquiry. This gives people the right to attend a public hearing, to give evidence, to cross-examine, and to call witnesses. A professional inspector listens, assesses, and then reports to government. An elected minister, accountable to parliament, makes the final decision. </p> <p>However, the planning bill now going through parliament, and due to become law in a few weeks, will remove all of these rights and safeguards. The law will mean that a new body, the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), will usually make all decisions without public hearings. Government-appointed commissioners will decide whether any part of the process will be heard in public. They will decide which witnesses are heard and who can cross-examine. The public retains only one right: an \"open floor\" session, at which ordinary people cannot ask questions or cross-examine. </p> <p><strong>Undemocratic</strong></p> <p>It is deeply undemocratic, it marginalises communities, and it does nothing to tackle climate change, yet the government has so far shown no willingness to compromise on its contents. For airport owners such as BAA and industry backers such as the CBI, this is a cause for celebration. But for many watchdog groups, it is a profound constitutional issue. </p> <p>In fact, planning will be in two parts. The government will publish up to 12 \"policy\" statements covering everything from roads to nuclear power, aviation and ports. These will set out what sort of developments should happen. When making a decision, the IPC will have to take these into account. Only limited objections will be admissible on local grounds. So, for instance, no one will be able to question the location of a new nuclear power station, or safety and technical issues.</p> <p>There is no constitutional precedent for the IPC. It will have powers over legislation, and can grant consent orders that remove all other forms of environmental regulation at a stroke. You will no longer be able to complain about the noise of development to your local council because the IPC consent order removes local authority powers to pursue a statutory nuisance. </p> <p>Sensible reform would at least have balanced the powers of the IPC with democratic safeguards, but the decisions taken by the IPC are not directly accountable to anyone. As a result, it is hard to see how they will ever be accepted as legitimate. For instance, the decision over whether to demolish thousands of houses for the third runway at Heathrow is ultimately a political judgment. The public accept these judgments when made by democratically elected politicians, but not when they are made by a group of technocrats who cannot be held accountable.</p> <p>The government has argued that the commission will have to report to parliament, but this provides a check only on the overall operation of the IPC; it does nothing to secure the accountability of individual decisions. Ministers have also countered that a new duty on developers to organise consultation on their own applications provides important opportunities for public engagement. </p> <p> How are members of the public meant to have confidence in a consultation process for a new runway at Stansted, say, if the process is run by BAA?</p> <p>The government has made much of the need to remove cross-examination in order to speed up the process. But cross-examination is an indispensable way of testing expert evidence. \"Expert\" testimony is often, in practice, simply an advocacy statement on behalf of one side or another. Only by allowing participants the chance to question such evidence can you test whether it stands up. It is not as if this expert testimony will be trivial in relation to hazardous waste or a nuclear power station.</p> <p>The government has also argued that the bill is vital to deliver the technology to tackle climate change. In fact, there are no duties even to think about climate change issues. Neither does the climate bill create any legal obligation on the IPC, a non-governmental body, to consider climate issues. </p> <p>There is a major and dangerous implementation gap between the climate bill and the planning bill, which could result in approval being given to major projects that undermine the government's carbon targets. </p> <p>The government has been very keen to portray all these concerns as an anti-development conspiracy. This is not the case. All participants have to accept decisions made in a fair and democratic way. The problem is that the planning bill assumes that taking people out of the process will speed it up, despite a complete lack of evidence that this is true. We should be able to generate consensus about the process, even if we disagree passionately about the outcomes. </p> <p>The new regime will force moderate environmental opinion to choose between legal challenge and direct action, and the bill will generate both on an unprecedented scale. </p> <p>The UK must take long-term infrastructure decisions to achieve sustainable development and, in particular, a competitive low-carbon economy. The decision-making on major infrastructure should be made more efficient, but not at the expense of proper scrutiny, accountability and public engagement. </p> <p>It has to be one of the great ironies of political life that only the unelected chamber still has the opportunity to defend democratic planning. We can only hope the Lords seize the opportunity to preserve a system that gives communities a real voice and sets us on course to creating a low-carbon society.</p> <p>\u2022 Hugh Ellis is a planning campaigner for Friends of the Earth.</p>",
  "<h2>Spooky behaviour</h2> <p>We've always known that government is secretive, but a freedom of information request from the little-known Office of Surveillance Commissioners reveals not just that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has its very own spooks, but that no one knows what they are up to. It seems that in 2006, Defra's spies targeted the Rural Payments Agency, the Egg Marketing Inspectorate, the Fish Health Inspectorate, and the Maritime Fisheries Agency, among others, but the inspectors' report on their work, seen by Eco Soundings, finds that all authorisations for \"directed surveillance\" - that is, secretly following people - were \"flawed\". It says: \"It's very unusual, if not unique, for inspectors to discover that there has been no discernible attempt [by senior staff] to try and establish what it is that enforcement officers do and how they do it.\"</p> <h2>Shipping news</h2> <p>Zut! The giant French aircraft carrier Le Clemenceau may not end its days in Hartlepool. Even as the toxic ship and its carcinogenic cargo of 760 tonnes of asbestos and 330 tonnes of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was being prepared last week to make its final voyage, the court of appeal reversed a decision by the high court. This means that the doughty Jean Kennedy, of the Friends of Hartlepool group, can make a full legal challenge - with the help of Public Interest Lawyers.</p> <h2>Minister for miracles</h2> <p>All heaven seems to have welcomed uber-townie Jane Kennedy as new minister of farming, waste, horses and a lot more. As soon as she was appointed, the gloomiest September ever gave way to glorious October sunshine, and fresh breezes bathed the land. Last week, Jane could report that Britain has had its best ever wheat harvest, and now comes her news that flytipping on public land across England has decreased by 7.5% in a year. Next week she is expected to abolish flooding.</p> <h2>Foul tackle</h2> <p>The government is widely - and sometimes wrongly - accused of talking up climate change but doing little about it. But now there is clear proof that rhetoric is officially the order of the day. Last week, it responded formally to the Environmental Audit Committee. Page 7, para 10, reads: \"The government is extremely committed to talking [sic] climate change domestically. The UK has made significant progress in reducing its GHG emissions.\"</p> <h2>Thirst for power</h2> <p>Is James Bond getting real? The plot of the new Quantum of Solace film concerns an environmental scientist who works for an evil bunch plotting to take over Latin America's water. Impossible, huh? Oh, no. This is clearly based on the vast Guarani aquifer, which lies beneath the surface of parts of Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil, and is one of the world's largest freshwater reserves. Real suspicions were raised that the US wanted to control the aquifer - which has enough water to supply 500 million people for centuries - when 400 armed American troops set up camp above it in 2005. This prompted Argentina's Nobel peace prize winner, Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel, to suggest they were there for the agua. If you can't face Bond, Eco Soundings recommends the excellent Sed, Invasion Gota a Gota (Thirst, Invasion Drop by Drop) by the Argentine film-maker Mausi Martinez - a real eco drama-doc.</p> <h2>Every little helps</h2> <p>The Federation of Poles, the wonderfully titled UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilisations, and the Professional Arabs Network have all been granted audiences with ministers at the Department for Communities and Local Government in the last year. So, too, have local councils, housing associations, estate agents, lobbyists, bankers, builders, architects and representatives of other private companies. Of all these, however, one stands out as the special one: Tesco is one of only three organisations granted two meetings - first with Yvette Cooper, and then with Hazel Blears. So what did they discuss? Current proposals to make it easier to build out-of-town stores, perhaps? Who knows? Meanwhile, could Tesco's rivals - only one other of which was granted a meeting, and a short one at that - form an orderly queue, please?</p>",
  "<p>The distinction between \"offenders\" and \"victims\" is far less clear than Jack Straw appears to believe (Straw puts victims first and says punishment is main point of prison, October 27). Berating what he terms the \"criminal justice lobby\" for \"[forgetting] who the victim is\" is misleading and disingenuous. The facts are more complex. Many offenders are victims too, and many of the most victimised offenders are detained in overcrowded prisons - a product of disastrous criminal justice policies implemented under successive governments in which Jack Straw has held senior office.</p> <p>Take child prisoners as an example. Over 70% of children in penal custody have been involved with, or in the care of, social services before entering custody. Significant numbers have been abused prior to custody and many report feeling unsafe while they are detained. Furthermore, approximately 85% of them will be discharged from prisons and returned to damaged communities where they will soon reoffend, such are the failings of custodial interventions. For as long as criminal justice policymakers seek legitimacy for such punishment, the conditions that give rise to offending and victimisation will remain unchecked. <br><strong>Professor Barry Goldson</strong><br>University of Liverpool</p> <p>On Monday in a lecture to the RSA Jack Straw declared that he was standing up for victims of crime. He used his speech as an opportunity to criticise a recent Barnardo's publication, which focused on the enormous rise in the numbers of children in custody for non-serious crimes, by saying it lacked any mention of victims. I would argue that our report was all about victims. I worked for Jack for many years and my views on custody have not changed. Custody can be effective and sometimes it is the only option. But sending young children to custody for short periods when they have committed - by the government's own definition - non-serious offences is utterly futile and does nothing to protect victims. <br><strong>Martin Narey</strong><br>Chief executive, Barnardo's</p> <p>Ian Loader makes an excellent critique of the weaknesses of our present criminal justice policy (Straw's embrace of penal excess ignores the public will, October 28). One area of significant concern is that use of unduly broad civil orders restricts rehabilitation. New Labour has introduced several, including asbos, Sopos and SCPOs. These often prevent offenders who wish to change gaining employment.</p> <p>Last week a persistent forger was banned by a court from \"owning ink\". Other restrictions that have been used with offenders include restrictions on the use of public transport and restrictions on access to the internet. Very few jobs these days can be done without at least some recourse to a biro or the internet. Many orders betray a lack of logic. Why ban an offender from the trains (in case they assault people) but not the streets?</p> <p>Labour policy has inverted the mantra of punishment and reform expounded by Straw. The jails are too full to punish people, and civil orders prevent many criminals from seeking employment or participating fully in society - all too often insurmountable obstacles to reform.<br><strong>Sam Smith</strong><br>Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire</p> <p>One part of the criminal justice process that regularly wins approval ratings from victims is restorative justice. As Jack Straw knows from the Ministry of Justice's ICM survey last November, 81% of victims would prefer an offender to receive an effective sentence rather than a harsh one, nearly two-thirds (63%) disagree that prison is always the best way to punish someone, and 94% say the most important thing was that the offender did not do it again. Eight in 10 would favour community sentences if they prevent reoffending. As a supporter of evidence-based policy, he will also know that research suggests that criminals are more deterred by the fear of being apprehended than by the likely sentence, as the Sentencing Advisory Panel has recognised.</p> <p>He advocates punishment and reform; unfortunately these contradict each other. Punishment makes people minimise or deny what they have done, think of themselves and disregard the victim. Restorative justice enables victims, if they wish, to tell the offender what they have done and to ask questions. This is tougher for offenders than sitting in a cell among other offenders. It holds them accountable and enables them to earn reacceptance into the community. If used instead of short prison sentences it would make Titanic prisons superfluous. Making victims feel better and offenders behave better - isn't that what we want? <br><strong>Martin Wright</strong><br>London</p> <p>Jack Straw does a disservice to victims when he derides phrases like \"criminogenic needs of offenders\". If we do not properly address these needs - which include having empathy for others, being able to control impulsive action, feeling included in the community and able to take a non-criminal part in it - we will just create more victims. </p> <p>While some violent people need to be locked up, punishment itself tends quite naturally to make people feel excluded, angry and powerless.</p> <p>I think we know that small prisons, which help people move on from immature and destructive thinking, and give inmates practical tools to move away from crime, work better than large prisons. We also know that work done with offenders in the community is more effective than that done in a prison. </p> <p>Too bad that Straw is intent on building monstrous Titan prisons, which seem to have more to do with politicians' desires to big themselves up than sensible solutions to reduce re-offending.<br><strong>Ruth Wyner</strong><br>Cambridge</p>",
  "<p><em>For the field is full of shades as I near <br> the shadowy coast,<br>And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling <br> of a ghost,<br>And I look through my tears on a <br> soundless-clapping host<br>As the run-stealers flicker to and fro,<br> To and fro:<br>O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!</em><br>- At Lord's, by Francis Thompson</p> <p>Francis Thompson's famous poem encapsulates the feeling of a certain type of cricket lover - wistful, nostalgic, yearning for a golden age. Think of John Major, with his warm beer, bicycling spinsters and village greens resounding to the thwack of willow on leather. But traditionalists - I count myself among this dewy-eyed throng - now face a challenge: to carry on feeling for a game that is undergoing its greatest revolution for more than a century. The epicentre of the earthquake is India, with its big-money Indian Premier League (IPL), where players can earn more in a month than their predecessors earned in their entire careers. But the starkest manifestation of the new mentality comes this Saturday, when England play the \"Stanford Superstars\" in a winner-takes-all Twenty20 (20 overs a side) match in Antigua worth $1m to each player on the winning side.</p> <p>The match is a disgrace at almost every level, and not just because its Texas billionaire backer, Sir Allen Stanford, has spent the past week on a dollar-driven ego trip, parading around his private ground, hogging the limelight and cavorting with the England players' wives. The key charge against the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which sanctioned the game, is that it is has sold its soul for the Stanford millions (the ECB gets $3.5m regardless of the result). </p> <p>\"The match has no cricketing value whatsoever,\" said Steve James, a former England player, when the squad was announced last month. \"Indeed to call it cricket at all will be difficult. For November 1 will be the night cricket is turned into reality TV, where some grisly voyeuristic fare is served up for those of a short attention span. Big Brother has finished: roll up instead to watch the nervous antics of the England cricket team. Who will drop a catch to cost his mates half a million quid?\"</p> <p>The traditionalists' view is expressed even more eloquently by Matthew Engel, the former editor of Wisden, though the eloquence comes from his silence - and absence. Engel is currently in the US covering the presidential election. I emailed him to ask what he thought of the Stanford match. \"I'd love to help,\" he emailed back, \"but I'm really really out of it, partly because I've been doing other things, partly because I'm so appalled by what is happening to cricket.\"</p> <p>It is an extreme view, but we spurned lovers of the game can become overwrought, embittered. Returning to the poem, the point about Hornby and Barlow is that they were not great or especially famous players - just the players that Thompson grew up with watching Lancashire. The field is full of shades - not just for Thompson but for all cricketing traditionalists. \"I saw Hutton in his prime /Another time, another time,\" hymns the arch-memorialist Harold Pinter. Now Pinter on Stanford - that would be a poem worth reading!</p> <p>Michael Atherton, the former England captain, once said that sportsmen should play for love of the game, and one would like to think that in the long term a successful career can only be sustained by such a feeling. But here is a match that exists purely and simply for money. Alastair Cook, the young England opener who is tipped as a future England captain, even admitted it. \"The actual cricket is quite unimportant, apart from financially,\" he said last month. </p> <p>The press conference in June that launched the match - and the series of which it is the culmination - was in execrable taste. Stanford arrived at Lord's by helicopter, touching down on the hallowed turf of the Nursery Ground, and had brought the all-important dosh with him, showing off a plastic crate full of $50 notes said to amount to $20m - the prize fund for the match. It was an appalling spectacle. \"Twenty20 is the future. That's where you're going to make your money,\" declared the man who thinks Test matches - the long-drawn-out, sometimes soporific five-day games that pit country against country - are boring. </p> <p>From the beginning, the ECB have been on the defensive over its link-up with Stanford. But chief executive David Collier argues that it had to take up the sponsorship. \"We would have been massively criticised if we'd not taken advantage of the opportunity,\" he tells me. \"If we don't embrace change, entrepreneurs will step in, and control of the game will slip away from governing bodies which care about Test cricket. There is always potential for unauthorised events, and that can pose a significant threat.\"</p> <p>The shadow of Kerry Packer, who bought up the 50 best players in the world for his own televised tournament in 1977, hangs over much of this thinking. Administrators feel they have to ride the wave, or it will overwhelm them. Collier believes that both Test cricket and Twenty20 can thrive as long as \"balance\" - the watchword of every current administrator - is maintained. \"The attraction of the Stanford series,\" he says, \"is that it's short and doesn't impact on the rest of the schedule. It will also benefit the grass roots of the game [through the $3.5m the ECB receives] and pay for development work in the Caribbean.\" </p> <p>The Stanford series may be an unedifying spectacle, but it is a symptom of what is happening to cricket, not the central problem. Cricket worldwide has gone Twenty20 crazy. Twenty20 began, as a professional attraction as opposed to a pub knockabout, in England in 2003. It was cricket-lite for a generation that didn't want to sit through a five-day Test match, or a four-day county game, or even the 50-over-a-side form of the game that had been seen as the salvation of the sport 30 years ago. Now, as it roars through India and beyond, it threatens to take over the world.</p> <p>When I pitched up at the Metropolitan police ground in East Molesey in July 2003 to see Surrey play Sussex in one of these new-fangled Twenty20 games, I didn't realise I was witnessing a watershed for cricket. Twenty20 was a clever wheeze developed by Stuart Robertson, the then marketing manager of the England and Wales Cricket Board. It was designed as a brief mid-season break from the rigours of the \"proper\" game - two weeks of high-summer fun and frivolity, with evening matches, lots of families, burger vans, bouncy castles and the occasional post-match gig. Atomic Kitten seemed to pop up a great deal. My hazy memories - the beer and the still-hot evening sun of a wonderful summer - are happy ones. But back then we didn't realise we were nurturing a monster.</p> <p>Five years on, this two-week antidote to the slog of long-form cricket has turned into a juggernaut that threatens to steamroller the global game. The heart of the danger lies in India, where the success of the glitzy, money-soaked IPL launched last April has transformed the power balance between Twenty20 and Test cricket. The IPL will henceforth be an annual competition lasting almost two months in which the world's best players can earn \u00a3700,000 - at least double what they would be paid on an annual contract with their countries. </p> <p>The Stanford series exists primarily because the England players were not allowed to take part in the inaugural IPL competition. While every other leading cricketer joined the IPL party, the England players were engaged in a low-key Test series against New Zealand, whose best players - rubbing salt into the England stars' financial wounds - arrived late to play the Tests carrying their money-filled suitcases from India. </p> <p>The success of the IPL has led other countries to contemplate their own Twenty20 competitions. The ECB and the counties are currently haggling over what form an English Premier League should take. There is also talk of a southern hemisphere Twenty20 league spanning Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The result is likely to be less and less time for Test cricket. \"The IPL want a window for their matches,\" says one leading administrator, \"but give them a window and everyone else will want one too. It'll be all windows and no glass.\" </p> <p>There is, though, another view to that of the nostalgists. Ed Smith, the captain of Middlesex, reckons it's too early to judge which way cricket will go. \"There's a danger of writing things off just because they're new,\" he says. \"Probably when the first Ashes series took place [in 1877], there were people moaning that it detracted from traditional county matches.\"</p> <p>There is some truth in his criticism - the average anoraked county cricket lover would make Edmund Burke look like a crazed radical. It is no coincidence that arch-Tory journalist Simon Heffer adores county cricket, and has rejected every alteration to the playing conditions since about 1952 - \"O my Boycott and my Edrich long ago!\". And it has to be said that WG Grace, progenitor of the modern game and shameless \"shamateur\", would have been the first one on the plane to India. </p> <p>But even Smith admits there are worries. \"There are lots of grounds for concern. We have to preserve what makes cricket unique and special - and that's the five-day game. Even though I love all forms of the sport, when I am asked to make a case for cricket I always turn to Test cricket. The narrative is so complicated and subtle and varying that no sport can match it.\"</p> <p>Test cricket is War and Peace; Twenty20 is a Jeffrey Archer short story. Test cricket, in its many-sidedness, reflects the age of George Eliot and Henry James; Twenty20, in its brashness and cupidity, reflects the age of Jonathan Ross. Administrators want both - long-form for its history, short-form for its hysteria - but, as ever, facing both ways is dangerous.</p> <p>Stuart Robertson, the man at the ECB who started the ball rolling back in 2003 and who is now commercial director of Hampshire cricket club, says that ultimately the market will decide which form of the game takes precedence. \"I love two-innings cricket [first-class matches played over four or five days],\" he says, \"and we saw Twenty20 as a means to an end - a way of bringing in new audiences. But it is not for administrators to determine the future of the game. That will be shaped by customers voting with their wallets and their feet. Tradition and heritage is one of cricket's strong points, but that mustn't mean cricket dies the death of a hundred cuts. Back in 2003, we'd seen a 17% decline in county attendances over the previous five years and we had to do something.\"</p> <p>What Robertson and his colleagues did was supposed to galvanise the county game, which - with a bit of help from Atomic Kitten - it did. But the law of unintended consequences has now kicked in ferociously, and the structure of the global game is under threat. The organisation which is supposed to keep the show on the road is the International Cricket Council, and its job over the next decade will be extraordinarily difficult, with rich businessmen such as Stanford offering players instant fortunes and national boards keen to organise lucrative tournaments that cut across ICC-backed events such as the World Cup and Champions' Trophy. </p> <p>Rather brilliantly, the ICC's spokesman Brian Murgatroyd turns this potential nightmare on its head and sees it as a sign of cricket's success. \"It's an indication that people want to be involved with cricket, and that has to be a good thing,\" he says. And those tacky Stanford millions? \"If players reach the top of their profession, there's an argument that they should be paid appropriately. If you were offered $250,000 for this article rather than the \u00a3200 the Guardian will pay you, you'd find it hard to say no.\"</p> <p>Murgatroyd says the ICC wants to preserve all three forms of the game - long-form, one-day and Twenty20. Indeed, he says, that will give the sport a unique advantage in the Darwinian struggle for fans and broadcasting money. \"It offers something for every taste,\" he argues, \"from the traditional fan who loves the cut and thrust of Test cricket, to the 50-over game, which has a history stretching back to the World Cup in 1975 and will also be appreciated by the purist, to Twenty20, the new kid on the block.\" Odd to hear one-day cricket proclaimed as a game for the purist - \"O my Capel and my Pringle long ago\" - but he makes this three-pronged attack sound an attractive proposition.</p> <p>Whether it is achievable is another matter. Murgatroyd suggests that after 2012, when the current cycle of Test tours come to an end, there may be scope for a new Test match structure, with national teams playing each other as part of a Test league system. My guess is that windows will be opened up to permit at least three glitzy, six-week Twenty20 competitions modelled on the IPL, and that all the less saleable Test series will be downsized and shoehorned into that league structure. Tours and major series, except for \"iconic\" ones such as the Ashes and Australia v India, will be consigned to history, and Test teams will instead jet in and out to play their league Test match. </p> <p>Does any of this matter? Who cares if it's played over three hours or, as in the case of the so-called Timeless Test between South Africa and England in Durban in 1939, 10 days (even then they didn't finish because England, close to making an astonishing 696 to win, had a boat to catch). I would say yes. First, because I value \"real\" cricket - the engrossing battle between bat and ball fought out over a sufficiently long period for true strength to emerge. Second, because context and tradition are everything - teams should represent a country, county or region, rather than a brand. But, most of all, because if money and the whim of the rich rule a sport, it consumes itself.</p> <p>The Stanford match marks another grisly stage in cricket's loss of innocence - or at least relative innocence, compared with the ugly, ill-tempered, money-obsessed, corporatist world of football. Perhaps Engel is right and the soul of the game has already been lost. After more than 40 years of loving the game, and always finding in its verities and absurdities solace in dismal times, it may be time for me to give up too. Certainly on November 1, I will be averting my eyes. But I hope something of its character and variety can be saved. The winners in Saturday's edition of Strictly Come Cricketing may make a cool million, but they could lose everything, including the essence of this odd and wonderful game.

  "<p>We know the rule and we know it is reliable in about 90% of cases: when a FTSE 100 company is yielding more than 10%, the dividend is unsustainable. So there ought not to be much debate about Aviva, where the yield is 14%. Surely the dividend is under threat and surely shareholders should be bracing themselves for a rights issue to boost solvency ratios.</p> <p>But it's not the message the management is sending. Aviva is \"strong\", says chief executive Andrew Moss. It had surplus capital of \u00a31.3bn at the end of last week. Investors should be assured that the valuation of assets provides \"a full picture\" of the financial position. And the dividend policy \"remains unchanged\". That's not the same as saying the dividend is safe, but, having lifted the interim payment by 10%, Moss is implying that it would take a further big move in financial markets to blow Aviva off course.</p> <p>So why the market scepticism? In part, it is because the insurer's financial cousins, the banks, adopted similar bold stances on dividends before accepting that they were hopelessly short of capital. Also because Aviva's surplus capital was \u00a3600m higher at the end of September - hard evidence that these numbers can move rapidly, notwithstanding the company's boast that a further 20% fall in stockmarkets would eliminate only \u00a3400m of capital. In any case, stockmarkets aren't the main worry: it is Aviva's exposure in its investment portfolios to corporate bonds, where eventual default rates are anybody's guess.</p> <p>Yet there's a fair argument that substantial defaults have already been priced in by Aviva, which reminds us that it must mark its assets to market valuations. That's what makes one think that - maybe, just maybe - catastrophe is not inevitable in the insurance sector. Unlike the banks, the insurers are not over-leveraged and they have been more tightly regulated since their disasters in 2003. The optimist says those qualities will prevail. The realist says the smoke signals in that dividend yield are genuinely worrying.</p> <p><strong>Oil slick</strong></p> <p>A windfall tax on BP? Dream on. It's not going to happen. The government lacked the muscle even to impose a windfall tax on the energy companies that sit closer to the consumer, the generators and suppliers; it had to settle for a three-year, \u00a31bn programme of energy saving measures.</p> <p>In any case, where is the windfall? BP made a \u00a391m loss from its refining and marketing operations in the UK, the division that includes the petrol stations. So it is hard to demonstrate that there is profiteering at the pump.</p> <p>Yes, BP made enormous profits from oil production, but only about 8% of these profits were made in the UK. The other 92% is out of reach of the government. If the government wants to increase its take on the 8%, it can do so through the established system of North Sea taxation, as Gordon Brown, as chancellor, did a few years ago. Unfortunately, tax rates on some fields are already above 70%, which is probably close to the point at which an increase would deter investment and be counter-productive in the long run. </p> <p>None of which will prevent BP's quarterly results being an occasion on which trade unionists - and now, it seems, Tory shadow chancellors - must show indignation. The noise rarely lasts long and this time will be no different. The blunt fact is that BP, as it smugly reminded everybody yesterday, accounts for 10% of the dividends paid to UK pension funds by FTSE 100 companies. After the dividend disaster delivered by the banks, the government is not about to pick a fight with BP.</p> <p><strong>Upside down</strong></p> <p>\"As you will know,\" said Tim Besley yesterday, \"there was a time last summer when I judged the upside inflationary risks to be sufficient to warrant an increase in bank rate.\"</p> <p>Yes, we do remember. The last of those summer days was August 7, which is only two and a half months ago, and you were the only member of the monetary policy committee who voted for an increase in interest rates.</p> <p>Besley did not admit in last night's speech that he made a mistake - he was offering more of \"when the facts change, I change my mind\" argument. It sounded limp, none the less. The fall in commodity prices, particularly in foodstuffs, was well under way by August. David Blanchflower, who was arguing at the time that the MPC should start worrying about inflation under-shooting the target rate of 2%, has been vindicated. Monetary policy ain't easy, but Besley got it badly wrong.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The morning after the last presidential debate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> was fundraising in front of a small group of elite Democrats inside the gilded interior of Manhattan's Metropolitan Club. He spoke about the financial crisis on Wall Street and thanked the Clinton supporters who were present, before explaining how he felt at the start of the final phase of the election.</p> <p>\"As some of you know, I have a body guy named Reggie Love, who is very famous because he's young and good looking. You know, cooler than the candidate,\" he began. \"But the reason I'm raising his name is that the other day, somebody said to him, 'Hey Reggie, how are you?' He said: '20 days!' And so, from here on out, any time someone asks Reggie what's going on, it's '17 days!' After two years of campaigning, that is basically our entire perspective.\"</p> <p>The shared perspective between Obama and Love is the result of an intense two-year campaign which they have experienced like buddies on a ridiculously long road trip. </p> <p>Obama likes to say that he lives vicariously through Love, trapped as he is inside the restraints of a presidential candidate's life.</p> <p>It was Love who introduced Obama to Jay-Z, loading the New York rapper's music on to an iPod which he bought as a birthday present for his boss. (Love himself spends most of every campaign flight wired into his own iPhone.) And it was Love who introduced Obama and his wife Michelle to the fist-bump that Fox News suggested was a greeting between terrorists. In truth, it was a greeting between Love and the staffers and reporters who were pretending (rather sadly) to be as cool as him.</p> <p>Reggie, as everyone on the campaign calls him, is more than a body man, whose official duties are to look after the candidate's personal needs. He carries the candidate's pens, his favourite snacks and drinks, an endless supply of chewing gum (Dentyne and Nicorette), as well as numerous bottles of water. </p> <p>He lines up the podium before the candidate steps out, and adjusts the autocue machines to the correct height, a few inches lower than his own. </p> <p>Body men and women have nothing to do with security - that is handled by the Secret Service - and everything to do with the immediate needs of the candidate. In reality, there is no official job description for a body man or woman. </p> <p>Marvin Nicholson was John Kerry's body man and now serves as Obama's national trip director (he is also one of Love's close friends). A New York Times profile of Nicholson in 2004 described him as \"part butler,\" which only served to heighten the caricature of Kerry as an aloof elitist. </p> <p>Hillary Clinton's body woman, Huma Abedin, was often portrayed as inscrutable and efficient. The only constant is that journalists like to portray body staffers as a mirror image of what they see in the candidate.</p> <p>But the official duties don't come close to capturing Reggie's close bond with Obama, who plays a role that is part boss and part big brother. At the start of Obama's day, Reggie is with him in the hotel gym or local YMCA, where they work out together. As the day rolls along, he travels with the nominee in his armoured SUV, managing the phone call list and dialling the numbers. At events, he is his personal photographer and stopwatch, alerting the candidate to the need to wrap up his comments and stick to his schedule.</p> <p>At 6ft 4ins (1.93m), the 26-year-old Love is a standout presence on the campaign - and not just because of his bald head or his proximity to the candidate. An impressive college athlete, he played football and basketball at Duke University, in North Carolina. After graduating in political science and public policy, Love was talented enough to try out with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys football teams, but did not make the cut. </p> <p>A year later, he applied for an internship in Congress and landed an interview in Obama's office, rising to the position of deputy political director.</p> <p>Love remains the best basketball player on Team Obama, and one of a handful of the candidate's regular teammates who can dunk the ball on a good day. Whether Love is having a good day depends on his after-hours activities. Early on in the campaign, Love spent a few of those hours having his inner arms tattooed with the phrase: \"My Word, My Bond, My Boyz, My Blood.\"</p> <p>With his prominence has come an unusual degree of public attention. People magazine named Love one of America's most eligible bachelors, a title that he would not dispute. Vanity Fair listed him as one of its In items.</p> <p>Back in his hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, Love is something of a college legend. At a rally earlier this year, Obama called his body guy on stage and led the crowd in a chant of his name. Then he handed him his jacket to carry off stage.</p> <p>Small wonder that he has his sights set on something other than being a body guy. As the campaign winds down, Love is cramming for law school exams. His goal: to return to Duke and emerge with the kind of qualification that Washington - and the rest of the world - takes seriously.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Wolffe is Newsweek magazine's correspondent travelling with the Obama campaign.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/oct/28/obama-reggie-love-democrat-campaign?picture=339091542\">In pictures: Reggie Love on the campaign trail with Barack Obama</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 30 2008.

  "<p>One of Britain's most senior military officers warned last night that there was no point in sending reinforcements to Afghanistan until the Afghans themselves were able to control the ground captured by foreign troops.</p> <p>Lieutenant General Sir Peter Wall, who is responsible for overseeing British military operations, said the notion that \"flooding\" Afghanistan with a \"whole load\" more troops was the solution was misleading.</p> <p>The Afghans had to deliver better governance and build up their own armed forces, he said. There was no point in investing more money and men in the country unless security and economic and social projects were seen to be \"inspired by the Afghans themselves\", he added. \"If we do it for them, it will just not count.\"</p> <p>Giving evidence to a joint session of the Commons defence and foreign affairs committees, the general was reflecting growing frustration among British defence chiefs about the failure of the Afghan government to support Nato military presence with economic and social progress. He said the process would be \"incremental, gradual, and take some time\".</p> <p>The US is pressing its Nato allies to send more troops to Afghanistan. But British commanders say there is a limit to what military force can do, and that it could be counter-productive, by allowing the Taliban to argue that the foreign occupation of the country was increasing, they say.</p> <p>The defence secretary, John Hutton, who was also giving evidence, said Britain had not received a call for help from the US. \"I am not going to sit here and be speculative about a request ... It can't be the role of the UK to fill up every gap,\" he said.</p> <p>However, he said that next year Britain would deploy to Afghanistan Merlin helicopters currently in Iraq. The plan to reduce the 4,000 British troops in southern Iraq to a few hundred in the first half of next year was on track, Hutton said.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, told the MPs that British troops would be in Afghanistan for as long as was necessary. \"When [the Afghans] are able to defend their own country, they won't need us,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Oh, who among us hasn't felt the wave of joy swelling within at the thought of leaving messages on a 78-year-old grandfather's answering machine claiming - and I can hardly type the words for laughing so much - to have fucked his granddaughter? And felt it break over us in a gladsome tide as we not only do so, but do so in front of our giggling best friend and two million listeners on our weekly Radio 2 show? Oh. Oh, you haven't? Then you are not Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross, who are currently being lambasted for doing just that on Andrew Sachs' answerphone during Brand's show last week.</p> <p>The prank call is a tricky beast to control these days. Perhaps it was simpler in the 70s, when the ur-prank callers, John Elmo and Jim Davidson, emerged. They used to call the irascible owner of the Tube Bar in New Jersey for the simple pleasure of getting Louis \"Red\" Deutsch to shout across his establishment to locate their friends Mike Ockhurtz, Pepe Roni and, of course, their Greek companion Al Kykyoras. Then they began taping the calls (including Deutsch's outbursts of fury on the - relatively few - occasions that he realised he'd been had), became an underground sensation during the 80s, and have since been immortalised by Matt Groening in Bart Simpson's ceaseless tormenting of bartender Moe Szyslak (\"Is Mr Freely there? First initials IP?\").</p> <p>Across the pond, we could field Peter Cook, whose favourite late-night pastime in the late 80s was to call into Clive Bull's radio show as Sven, the melancholic Norwegian fisherman despairing at his relationship with wife Yuta and sharing his passion for fish with the British people, and Victor Lewis-Smith.</p> <p>Lewis-Smith used his own radio shows to make calls to various unwitting marks. Some of them were touched with genius: merely reading about the time he - exorcising, or possibly just exercising, a lifelong animus towards Esther Rantzen - called the always fodder-seeking That's Life office posing as a wheelchair-bound trombonist who then collapsed while trying to play the Sailor's Hornpipe down the phone for them still causes me to choke on my own lungs with laughter. </p> <p>Some were clever one-liners made flesh - such as ringing the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to ask why there was just one of them - and some were just plain daft - calling Harrods (\"Is that H.A.Rods?\"), for example to return a faulty vacuum cleaner that he had bought \"to suck the dust off sausages\" and others failed dismally. Most redolent of, though on a much smaller scale than, the current Brand-Ross furore was when he rang in to This Morning to complain of a bad back on the grounds that \"Richard and Judy are the biggest pain in the arse so they should know what to do\", visibly upsetting Judy. </p> <p>And therein lies the problem. For a prank phone call to work, abuse is not enough. Literally anyone can call up and discomfit someone if they know enough swear words or embarrassing secrets. The prankster must add value. It can be as simple as identifying a worthy prankee, as Scott Mills did on his radio show when he discovered a permanently and pathologically unpleasant local pizza-delivery shop owner and perpetrated some of the classics on him (\"Do you do takeaway?\" \"Of course we do takeaway.\" \"OK, what's 12 minus 6?\" \"**** you, ye ****! ****ing *** off!\"). The raw power of a man who could go from zero to apoplexy in under a second made sure the series of calls was a study in untapped human potential.</p> <p>Just occasionally a hoax call can function as a public service. In 2005 Rory Bremner posed as Gordon Brown and managed to have an extensive conversation with Margaret Beckett about the next Cabinet reshuffle, her feelings about Patricia Hewitt and the difficulties of managing John Prescott - couched in tones that veered from motherly to coquettish and back again, and left Bremner quite perturbed by the factionalism it revealed.</p> <p>Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard also performed an oblique public service when his impression of the Canadian prime minister Jean Chretien enabled him to secure an amiable 15-minute chat with the Queen. Who knew, until that moment, that all we had to do to get some one-on-one time with our allegedly inaccessible monarch is muster a passable Quebecois accent and give Buck House a ring? Brassard's Chretien also skipped gaily through the Vatican's ring of telecommunicative steel round Pope John Paul II, which made you fear for the pontiff's security generally - at least once the temptation to dial the number yourself and run through a quick list of pressing questions (\"Transubstantiation? Are you sure?\") had passed. </p> <p>In 2003 two presenters at Miami-based radio station El Zol pulled off the very rare double prank of, first, calling and getting through to Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and recording their conversation, then using his taped voice to bypass Fidel Castro's henchmen and talk to the Cuban dictator themselves. When Castro realised what had happened, the air was filled with inventive Communist swearing and the Federal Communications Commission eventually fined the station $4,000, which the presenters took down to the FCC's offices themselves, paying the entire sum in pennies.</p> <p>But perhaps the greatest recent prank caller has been Jon Culshaw. He made his most famous hoax call in 1998, fooling the Downing Street switchboard with his impression of William Hague and getting through to Tony Blair. That call was ultimately a failure - Blair realised at once that it was not Hague, proving that it takes an actor to catch an actor - but the series of spoof calls to directory enquiries, bookies and caravan sellers as Tom Baker's Dr Who on Dead Ringers were an unbroken string of triumphs. Not only were they funny (\"You're 'The Doctor'? Somebody here knows you, do they?\" \"How are you spelling Gallifrey?\"), they were oddly uplifting. Never have I been prouder to be British than when witnessing the grace under pressure, the enduring politeness, the utter, copper-bottomed decency displayed by fellow citizens before they realise what is going on (\"The Master plans to invade Morecambe.\" \"I see, sir, yes.\") and the willingness to embrace the joke after it does (\"Can I place 200 Briteuro dollars on Alan Titchmarsh winning a second term as prime minister?\" \"Yes,\" says the bookie, laughing in recognition. \"Can I do that?\" \"Certainly, sir.\").</p> <p>The quality prank call, however, looks now like an endangered species. The last great flowering may have been the US Comedy Central show Crank Yankers, which ran for five years until cancelled in 2007, during which it built up a revolving cast of characters - including a 62-year-old psychotic Vietnam vet with a 600lb wife and conjoined twin daughters, a scatalogically inclined mother of innumerable semi-feral children and a British earl of plentiful, unspecified perversion - who embroil unwary people increasingly surreal conversations. The emphasis is on the improvisation, not on cruelty to the \"marks\"; an emphasis that is further underlined by the fact that the conversations are enacted by puppets, not broadcast \"straight\". </p> <p>The growing fashion for entertainment that relies on embarrassing or humiliating people - reality-show contestants mainly, but still people - and the slipping quality control at the BBC (a senior executive is said to have signed off on the pre-recorded Sachs segment and Sachs himself claims his request that it not be aired was ignored) suggests that the intelligent prank call, engineered by someone who understands that there is a difference between bending social conventions and breaking them, between upsetting victims' expectations and upsetting victims will become an increasingly rare sight. The art of the hoax lies in making the incredible briefly credible, not in indulging in actions that beggar belief.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008 to restore some missing text in the final paragraph and to correct the name of the television programme That's Life, which we had referred to as This Life.</p>",
  "<p>A senior Whitehall official who left highly classified intelligence documents about al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces on a train was fined \u00a32,500 yesterday by Westminster magistrates court after admitting negligence.</p> <p>Richard Jackson, 37, of Yateley, Hampshire, who had been seconded from the Ministry of Defence to the Cabinet Office, was charged under a section of the Official Secrets Act covering the safeguarding of information. It is the first prosecution of its kind and it had been assumed in Whitehall he would be disciplined by internal procedures rather than charged under the criminal law. The court heard he had already taken a \"drastic\" pay cut and effectively been demoted by three grades.</p> <p>The two joint intelligence committee documents were left on a London Waterloo to Surrey train on June 10. </p> <p>They were found inside an orange cardboard envelope on a train by a member of the public who passed them to the BBC's security correspondent, Frank Gardner. He subsequently reported the loss. A damage assessment carried out by the Cabinet Office found the loss had the \"potential to damage national security and the UK's international relationships but to date this appears negligible\", the court heard. </p> <p>District judge Timothy Workman said: \"Had there been real risks to national security a custodial sentence, possibly suspended, would have been inevitable.\" He said he had taken into account Jackson's good character, remorse, full cooperation and guilty plea. \"I am conscious that he has already paid a heavy penalty, a significant reduction in income and damage to his own and his family's health,\" the judge said. </p> <p>Jackson, who had a previous warning for not locking secret files in his safe, had accidentally picked up the files with some other papers as he left the office on June 9 and did not realise he had them until he was almost home, the court heard. </p> <p>As he returned them to the office the next morning he put the folder on the train seat beside him, then got off at Waterloo without them. By the time he realised he had forgotten them the train was already on its way to Woking. He then spent the day frantically visiting lost property offices in the hope of recovering the files.</p> <p>Neil Saunders, defending, said his client accepted his mistake but \"there was never any risk to any lives whatsoever\". He said: \"He was under extreme pressure at this time and it may well be partly because of his own role, the team he was leading and the work he was being asked to conduct that he has made this gross error of judgment.\" </p> <p>Deborah Walsh, prosecuting, said Jackson, who has been sent back to the MoD, did not report the loss of the files until the next day as his superiors were abroad. She added: \"There's ample evidence that Mr Jackson failed to take such care to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the documents as somebody in his position may reasonably be expected to take.\" </p> <p>One of the documents was a seven-page assessment on al-Qaida. The other was described by Gardner at the time as a \"top-secret and in some cases damning\" assessment of Iraq's security forces.</p> <p>Jackson had permission to take the documents out of the office as long as sufficient security was provided, meaning a locked box, Whitehall officials said.</p>",
  "<p>Four leading private schools in Scotland were yesterday ordered to increase their spending on bursaries or risk being stripped of their charitable status. </p> <p>They include two of Scotland's premier fee-charging schools, Hutchesons' Grammar in Glasgow and Merchiston Castle in Edinburgh, which have been told they have a year to put forward plans to expand bursaries to meet the test. </p> <p>Hutchesons' was criticised for only giving 49 bursary places this year out of a roll of 1,750 pupils. Founded in 1643, the \u00a39,000-a-year mixed-sex day school is one of Scotland's oldest. Its alumni include John Buchan, author of The Thirty-nine Steps, James Maxton, the militant Independent Labour MP, and TV presenter Carol Smillie.</p> <p>If the schools fail to dramatically improve their bursary offer within three years they will lose their lucrative charitable status and face closure.</p> <p>Gordonstoun, the institution favoured by the royal family, was cleared and told its provision for students who cannot afford the fees is adequate, along with five other schools inspected by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR). </p> <p>The other two schools which failed the public benefit test are Lomond school in Helensburgh, whose pupils include navy children from Faslane submarine base, and St Leonards in St Andrews.</p> <p>Scottish law was changed in 2005 to make sure every charity passes a public benefit test to justify their tax breaks, which are worth \u00a34.5m to the small independent school sector in Scotland but more than \u00a3100m in England. </p> <p>Similar changes followed in England and Wales a year later and the first inspections of independent schools are under way in England and Wales. </p> <p>It is the first time schools anywhere in Britain have been told that they have failed the test and threatened with losing their status. There are concerns in the independent sector that more bursaries will mean increased fees. Jane Ryder, chief executive of the OSCR, said the public benefit test had not been met in the four schools \"mainly due to significant fees and the fact that there was not sufficient help in place so that those who cannot pay the fees can also benefit from what the charity does\".</p> <p>Under the law across the UK, charities have to demonstrate that children can benefit from their core purpose - providing an education - regardless of their ability to pay. </p> <p>In Scotland this has widely been interpreted as expanding bursaries. </p> <p>In England and Wales there has been an intense debate about whether bursaries disadvantage the state system by creaming off the most able students from comprehensives. </p> <p>The Charity Commission is yet to publish final guidance to schools but it is likely to suggest schools will be able to meet their public benefit by working on sponsoring state-funded academies. </p> <p>The schools accused yesterday reacted with dismay. Michael Carslaw, headmaster of St Leonards, which charges up to \u00a323,000 for boarding pupils in the secondary school, said: \"I respect the OSCR assessment but I am disappointed not yet to have been given an explanation for it. When we have an understanding of what needs to be done, we will do our best to fulfil any reasonable obligation.\"</p> <p>Judith Sischy, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, said she was \"confident\" that the four schools would comply with the laws and retain their status. \"They have been encouraged to look at ways of increasing public benefit by widening access and offering more bursaries. We are sensitive to the needs of parents, especially in the current economic climate, and we have always tried to support families.\"</p> <p>Matthew Burgess, deputy chief executive of the Independent Schools Council, said the legal system was different in England and Wales, and the Scottish judgment would have no judicial effect there.</p>",
  "<p>John Freeman (Letters, October 9) says it is dangerously wrong not to consider teachers who have sexual relations with pupils over 16 as sex offenders and that teachers should know the boundaries that must not be crossed. True love does not respect any boundaries, as my own experience will testify. Forty-four years ago I fell in love with a 16-year-old girl student at the college where I taught. She became pregnant with our first son while still at the college and four months after his birth we married. We are still happily married, having brought four fine sons into this world. Should I be retrospectively classified as a sex offender? Thankfully no such inhuman law was in force in 1965. Nor do I accept that I should be considered as being guilty of professional misconduct as Dyana Rodriguez (Letters, October 10) insists - nor \"gross imprudence, recklessness and fecklessness\".

  "<p>Prosecutors fear a high court judgment today will lead to the first criminal cases against people who helped their terminally ill relatives to die.</p> <p>They believe that efforts by Debbie Purdy, a terminally ill MS sufferer who has asked the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to clarify the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/law\">law</a>, could end the practice of turning a blind eye to the growing number of Britons travelling abroad to clinics where they help their relatives die.</p> <p>More than 90 UK citizens have travelled abroad with relatives to countries where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/assisted-suicide\">assisted suicide</a> is legal. Although many of these cases have been investigated by the police, none has been prosecuted.</p> <p>Sources close to the Crown Prosecutions Service (CPS) say officials are privately reluctant to bring criminal proceedings in such cases. However, campaigners say Purdy's attempts to seek clarification of CPS policy represent a \"high risk strategy\" which may compel prosecutors to take a tougher line. \"If the DPP does publish guidelines it will make it more likely that the decision will be made to prosecute,\" said David Matthew, a leading barrister who prosecutes criminal cases. \"All cases where people die are taken very seriously. It's difficult for a prosecutor to shut off a whole area from prosecuting.\"</p> <p>Sir Ken Macdonald, the outgoing DPP, has said he would not be willing to publish guidelines granting immunity from prosecution in assisted suicide cases. \"It's for parliament to decide what the law should be and we operate according to the legislation,\" a spokesperson for the DPP said. \"We are awaiting the judgment and if parliament wants to look at the law then that's a matter for parliament.\"</p> <p>While the law continues to make assisting suicide a criminal offence, lawyers say the CPS may have no choice but to prosecute.</p> <p>\"Any further guidelines may prove restrictive,\" said John Cooper, a barrister who has written about the state of the law on suicide. \"It may also result in prosecutions, which might not be in the public interest.\"</p> <p>The law makes assisting the suicide of another, including a terminally ill friend or relative, a crime carrying a sentence of up to 14 years' imprisonment. It is legal in other jurisdictions, including Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the US state of Oregon. </p> <p>Purdy fears that if her husband travels with her to Switzerland to assist in her suicide, he could be prosecuted on his return. \"It is important that the law and the DPP's policy should be clarified,\" said Saimo Chahal, her lawyer. \"There are many other people in the same situation. They should know what the consequences of their actions will be.\"</p> <p>The issue came to the fore last month when it was revealed that a 23-year-old, Daniel James, had been helped to travel to Switzerland to end his life. James, paralysed from the chest down since March last year after a rugby scrum collapsed on top of him, ended his life at the Dignitas clinic on September 12, accompanied by his parents. Prosecutors are considering whether they should face criminal charges. Campaigners say the absence of clear guidelines enables prosecutors to take a compassionate stance by deeming it not in the public interest to prosecute. \"As things stand, relatives are not being prosecuted for assisting suicide,\" Nan Maitland, a campaigner for Friends at the End, said. \"This might change in future if the CPS are forced to outline a clear policy\".</p> <p>Attempts to legalise assisted suicide in Britain have been rejected. The most recent, in 2006, was defeated in the House of Lords by 148 votes to 100.</p>",

  "<p>Repossessions up 71%. Activity in the high street down for the seventh month in a row. Short-term working at Honda's Swindon plant. An estimate by the Bank of England that losses from the financial turmoil now stand at $2.8 trillion. Just another normal day in the economy.</p> <p>For most people, $2.8 trillion is a meaningless number, as is the news of BP's \u00a310bn profit. What they want to know is how bad is it going to get, who is to blame and whether life will be any better when the economy emerges, as it eventually will, from its problems.</p> <p>The answer to the first question is simple: for the UK this is going to be a painful reality check after all the years of living on tick. As things stand, the economy could contract for at least four of five quarters, leading to rapidly rising unemployment. Falling house prices will expose more and more families who bought homes from 2005 to 2007 to the perils of negative equity. After 15 years of growth, prolonged austerity will come as an almighty shock.</p> <p>Gordon Brown has no doubt who is to blame for all this: the irresponsible bankers who invested unwisely in all those US sub-prime mortgages during the boom years. Britain, he insists, is being sucked down by global forces beyond the control of a government doing its level best to help. Not all of this is piffle - although much of it is.</p> <p>Clearly, Britain is not alone in going through tough times: the fact that there are daily bulletins on the economic health of Iceland, Hungary, Ukraine, Argentina and Turkey, in addition to the usual diet of gloomy news from the G7, is evidence that this is a global downturn of some severity. Yet, as Warren Buffett once put it, when the tide goes out you learn who's been swimming naked - and as the water has receded rapidly down the beach, it has been possible for the first time in many years to see the UK economy as nature intended. And it is clear we are not getting a glimpse here of Botticelli's Venus.</p> <p>The markets have certainly come to the belated conclusion that the UK is mutton dressed up as lamb. Shares have bombed in London over the past month because of the recognition that the UK corporate sector is about to endure a long and painful recession, which will lead to a sharp reduction in profits. Sterling fell against the dollar last week by more than it did in the immediate aftermath of Black Wednesday in September 1992. Why? Because the UK has papered over the cracks of a hollowed-out industrial base by taking risky bets in the global financial markets. The epic scale of the UK's trade deficit has been disguised, up to a point, by the willingness of the City to act like a hedge fund - borrowing for short periods and lending for long periods. Hedge funds are risky businesses; they thrive in the good times but can go bust when the weather changes, as it has over the past year. In those circumstances, the foreign holders of sterling seem resolutely unconvinced by Brown's claim that Britain is better placed than before to ride out the storm. They have had a quick squint at the 6% of GDP trade deficit, the debt-sodden consumer, the crashing housing market - and headed straight for the exit.</p> <p>Again, it would be fatuous to make Brown the scapegoat for structural problems that have been long gestating. The brutal fact, though, is that the economy is more unbalanced after 11 years of Labour government; this is not, despite the hype, a knowledge economy fit to meet the challenges of the 21st century, it is a debt-dependent economy once again about to go into rehab.</p> <p>The cold turkey will be all the more painful because of the mess the Bank of England has made of setting interest rates. Monetary policy was kept far too tight for far too long: something only one member of the MPC appeared to realise as the economy headed unerringly towards the rocks over the past six months. While the Federal Reserve in the US was cutting interest rates aggressively to cushion the impact of recession, the MPC here was twittering away about inflation. The bank normally moves rates in quarter-point moves: it is now under pressure from the markets to reduce borrowing costs by a full point next week in order to make up for lost time. That's how far behind the curve it now is. If Mervyn King had been managing his beloved Aston Villa rather than a central bank, he would have been fired by now.</p> <p>And after the deluge, what then? It would be nice to report that lessons have been learned and that the future promises tougher controls on credit creation, the renaissance of the industrial base to meet the environmental challenge, the permanent cageing of the City. But do you honestly believe that is going to happen, whoever is in charge? No, me neither.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor <br><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@guardian.co.u\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Stealthily, without even a modest press release to accompany it, a consultation document was released last week on a subject of great public importance. It came from the Youth Citizenship Commission, via the Ministry of Justice, and it asked: should 16-year-olds be given the vote? I would have thought a public consultation on that topic would have merited a great deal of publicity, but the government prefers to take a secretive route. It has already made up its mind in favour of the vote at 16, although that, too, was revealed in circumstances bordering on the private, by way of a decision taken at July's Labour party policy forum in Warwick. Hardly anyone noticed. The reason why the government is happy to keep the issue quiet is simple: the public is overwhelmingly against reducing the voting age from 18 to 16. </p> <p>The question was last explored comprehensively as recently as 2004, by the Electoral Commission, which concluded that the 18 age limit should stay. So what has changed? Education, claim supporters of the lower age. Every 16-year-old at school today will have been taught citizenship, a subject now compulsory in the national curriculum. They should now be more aware than any 16-year-olds before them of the way our institutions work and of the issues relevant to participation in our parliamentary democracy. That, in theory, advances their cause to be given the vote. But there's a lot of dissatisfaction about the teaching of citizenship; there's a widespread view that it's one of the least well-taught topics. But, anyway, should the existence of one relevant school subject tip the scales in favour of the 16-year-old vote? </p> <p>There is another argument, often put, that I reject. If, under the law, 16-year-olds can join the armed forces or get married or pay taxes, surely they should be entitled to vote. Why? The attributes required for those activities do not necessarily fit the teenager to place his X on a ballot form. We now have a law prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to under-18s. One could just as well argue that anyone whom the law can't trust to buy a fag has no business participating in our elections.</p> <p>There is, of course, no particular birthday on which a person becomes mature enough, aware enough, sensible enough or knowledgeable enough to be trusted with the vote. There are responsible and wise 14-year-olds, just as there are 60-year-olds who, on any objective assessment, ought not to be allowed within miles of a polling booth. Our system cannot test people to ascertain their worthiness to vote. We allow the ignorant, the foolish and the prejudiced the same right to participate in our democracy as the educated, the reasonable and the mature. </p> <p>The fact is that there can be no measurable criteria for deciding when to allow teenagers to vote. It's a feeling. Perhaps the only valid question is whether or not we instinctively believe that they have had sufficient, let's call it, experience of life. In 1969 there was a general view that the 21 age limit - in force since 1928 - could safely be reduced to 18. There is no such near-consensus today. When the public was last asked, less than five years ago, 78% thought that 18 was right and 16 too young. The lower age may have gained some supporters since, but I have no doubt that a substantial majority today would still be against change. I do not criticise the government's wish to see more young people electorally engaged; only 37% of 18- to 24-year-olds eligible to vote in the 2005 general election did so. But 16-year-olds have not absorbed enough of the world. They do not deserve the vote and the government ought not to be thinking of giving it to them. </p> <p><strong>This time it was not Jacqui Smith's fault. She told </strong>parliament of her plan to name publicly the \"preachers of hate\" who were not being allowed to enter Britain. But the majority of the media was not satisfied with reporting their mere naming. They were being \"named and shamed\", the newspapers decided. It's a snappy rhyme, and because of that it has become a cliche of the criminal justice system, used excessively, wrongly and misleadingly. Take the extremist preachers. Named they may be, but where does the shame come in? They will certainly not feel ashamed of being on Smith's banned list. On the contrary. </p> <p>Closer to home, judges and magistrates have the power to reveal the names (usually kept anonymous) of youngsters convicted of crime - naming and, allegedly, shaming them. What's the reality? Their naming, far from being a badge of shame, is usually a badge of honour, making the teenage tearaway a hero in his community. Or the naming labels the youngster a criminal, making it harder to treat and rehabilitate him, away from the surrounding publicity. </p> <p>Most recently, naming and shaming has taken the form of local newspapers splashing photos and names of people allegedly dropping litter. Those minor offenders are not shamed; they are publicly humiliated with consequences grossly disproportionate to the triviality of their crime; not least, their children suffer their own humiliations at the hands of their peers. I have yet to be convinced that the term \"naming and shaming\" has any meaningful validity, in any circumstances. Its use should be disallowed.</p> <p><strong>This week Marcel read </strong>Chicago by Alaa Al Aswany: \"A bit disappointing after his wonderful The Yacoubian Building, set vividly in Cairo.

  "<p>One hundred years ago Annie Horniman opened Manchester's refurbished Gaiety Theatre, igniting the British repertory movement. To mark this event, the Library Theatre is reviving this little-known 1909 play by Stanley Houghton, part of the \"Manchester School\" assiduously championed by Horniman. While it may not be as fine as Houghton's later Hindle Wakes, it fittingly reminds us that female empowerment was a dominant theme of Edwardian drama.</p> <p>Houghton's setting is Salchester, a fictive blend of Salford and Manchester, and his protagonist is the redoubtable Sidney Forsyth. Although a socialist and suffragist, Sidney has rashly married Edgar Forsyth, who proves to be as staunchly conservative as his domineering dad, and hopelessly unemployable. When Forsyth Sr is bankrupted after speculating with his dwindling capital, the family faces disaster. Sidney takes a secretarial job in a car showroom, prompting her husband to announce that \"no decent husband could live off his wife's earnings\". But Houghton ultimately suggests that female independence can be combined with marital harmony.</p> <p>This, for me, is the play's flaw. You wonder what on earth Sidney sees in the useless Edgar. It is fascinating to compare the play with Githa Sowerby's more radically feminist Rutherford and Son (1912), in which women achieve true freedom only by dismissing their dithering menfolk. </p> <p>Nonetheless, despite its compromised ending and over-neat plotting, Houghton aims some shrewd blows at Edwardian patriarchy. Far from sympathising with her failed father-in-law, Sidney rounds on him with embattled vigour, and she resoundingly tells her husband: \"I must be loyal to myself first of all.\" Houghton liked happy endings, but you can hear rumbling echoes of the slammed door at the climax of Ibsen's A Doll's House.</p> <p>The play certainly merits revival, as Chris Honer's production handsomely proves. Sarah Williamson's set neatly transmogrifies from floral family home to brash motor depot. Ruth Gibson is full of fire and steel as the self-realising Sidney, who even argues that she should not be patronised by being paid wages above the national norm. Rupert Frazer reveals the hollowness behind the elder Forsyth's tyrannical bluster, while Geoff Breton does all that is possible to reconcile us to his wetly conventional son. </p> <p>But the evening's real heroine is Miss Horniman, whom the Library celebrates on November 8 with a day of talks, walks and readings reminding us of the debt British theatre still owes to its female pioneers.</p>",

Kercher's housemate Amanda Knox and Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were ordered to stand trial in December.</p> <p>Ivory Coast-born Guede, 21, had asked for a fast-track trial over his role in the killing of Kercher, 21, who was found semi-naked in a pool of blood in her bedroom in Perugia, where she was studying. Sollecito, an Italian IT graduate, and Knox, an American student, will now face a full trial starting on December 4 in Perugia before two judges and a jury of six. They will stand trail for murder and sexual assault, as well as theft, said the judge, Paolo Micheli, after 11 hours of deliberation.</p> <p>\"Today has been a really important step towards justice for Meredith,\" said Kercher's sister Stephanie, 25, who entered the courtroom at 9.15pm through a scrum of journalists to hear the ruling, accompanied by her parents and her brothers, John and Lyle. Asked afterwards how he had felt being face to face with Guede, John Kercher, 32, said: \"I was overwhelmed. The judge said he believes he killed our sister and for me that was overwhelming.\"</p> <p>Lyle Kercher, 29, said the family had \"always had full trust in the Italian police and the legal system\".</p> <p>Monica Napoleoni, the head of the Perugia murder squad, said she was extremely happy about Guede's sentence. \"We are very pleased, for Meredith,\" she said.</p> <p>On hearing the rulings, Knox reportedly cried. \"Don't you worry, this is just the beginning, we will fight on,\" her lawyer, Carlo Della Vedova, told her. </p> <p>Sollecito, who was likened by his lawyer to a \"lost bird\" at the hearing, asked when he was going to be allowed to go home, while Guede stared blankly ahead on hearing his sentence.</p> <p>Micheli will announce on Wednesday whether Knox and Sollecito can be placed under house arrest before and during their trial or whether they must remain in nearby jails, where they have been since they were arrested on November 6.</p> <p>If Sollecito is granted house arrest, he could be allowed to return to his family home near Bari, or to a property owned by one of his lawyers in Perugia.</p> <p>The religious charity Caritas has made two houses in Umbria available for Knox. They are used as religious retreats but also take in people under house arrest, former drug addicts and people with psychological problems. One of her lawyers has also proposed a country bed and breakfast near Perugia.</p> <p>Micheli will take up to 60 days to give his reasons for Guede's sentence. Until then, Meredith's brother John said that the family would have no clearer understanding of really happened to her on November 1. </p> <p>\"In the next 60 days we will get the judge's reasons in writing and we will take from that some of the story,\" he said.</p> <p>Prosecutors believe that Knox stabbed Kercher while Sollecito held her down and Guede tried to rape her during a sex game that went out of control.</p> <p>Guede, who admits he was at the house, asked for a fast-track trial because he feared a pact between the other two suspects, who have maintained that they spent the evening at Sollecito's house.</p> <p>Guede has claimed that he had retreated to the bathroom with stomach pains seconds before two shadowy figures he would later identify as Knox and Sollecito burst in and stabbed Kercher.</p> <p>He fled to Germany, but was extradited back to Italy after police discovered his bloody handprint on a cushion underneath Kercher's body.</p> <p>Investigators also say they found Knox's DNA coupled with Meredith's DNA on a knife in Sollecito's kitchen which is believed to be the murder weapon, as well as traces of Knox's blood mixed with Kercher's in their bathroom and Sollecito's DNA on a torn off clasp from Kercher's bra.</p> <p>Lawyers are likely to argue at the trial that the DNA on the clasp and the knife stems from contamination, as they have done at the pre-trial hearings.</p> <h2>Killer's past</h2> <p>Rudy Guede arrived in Italy in 1992 at the age of five from the Ivory Coast with his father, who had raised him after separating from his mother. When Guede was 15 his father went back to Africa and was prevented from returning for a year due to civil war. Guede was taken in by Paolo Caporali, a prosperous local businessman, whose family continued to look after him when his father returned to Perugia, where he now works as a labourer. Guede left Perugia for Lecco near Milan and, prosecutors believe, descended into drug-taking and crime.</p>",

I pulled the bag back and noticed it contained something. I saw a black revolver and a black semi-automatic pistol.\"</p> <p>Sean Mercer, 18, of Croxteth, denies murder and also denies being a member of the Crocky Crew gang. </p> <p>The prosecution says Mercer cycled to the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park and fired three shots across the car park at alleged members of the rival Nogga Dogz gang, based in nearby Norris Green estate.</p> <p>The jury has been told the second bullet struck Rhys. He bled to death in the arms of his mother, Melanie. The prosecution later called as a witness a 16-year-old relative of Sean Mercer, who cannot be identified. Via a videolink, he refused to give evidence to the court. </p> <p>Flewitt asked him: \"Where were you when you heard about the shooting of Rhys Jones?\" The boy said: \"No comment.\" </p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Irwin, told him: \"Everyone can see it's not easy to give evidence, but you have a duty to do it.\" </p> <p>The boy said: \"I'm just so nervous and scared.

  "<p>Iraq's government rebuked Washington yesterday for launching a military raid into neighbouring Syria from Iraqi soil, while Damascus retaliated by ordering a US school and cultural centre to be closed.</p> <p>In a brief public comment more than 24 hours after the special forces strike, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ali al-Dabbagh, said Baghdad rejected raids on its neighbours and did not want to be used as a launch pad.</p> <p>\"The constitution does not allow Iraq to be used as a staging ground to attack neighbouring countries,\" Dabbagh said, though he also called for an end to insurgent activity in Syria.</p> <p>The Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, last night said Iraqi officials had \"started to see the truth\" about the raid. </p> <p>Damascus took its first reprisals against Sunday's raid by ordering the indefinite closure of the American school and a cultural centre. Both cater to the small US community and other expatriates in the Syrian capital. The Syrian cabinet said the US had violated the UN charter and international law with its raid. </p> <p>Syria's ambassador to the UN called for action to prevent a repeat attack. In a letter to the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, Bashar Ja'afari said that the council holds the US \"politically\" and \"legally\" responsible. According to Syria, US troops, backed by helicopters, launched the attack near Abu Kamal, five miles into its territory, killing eight people including four children.</p> <p>US officials in Baghdad have refused to comment on the attack. However, officials in Washington and in the Iraqi government have claimed a henchman of the slain former leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed in the raid on a compound in Sukkariyeh.</p> <p>The man was identified as Abu Ghadiyah. Iraqi media also claimed that at least one man was captured and flown into Iraq by US forces, who disembarked from two of four helicopters. At least eight people are thought to have been killed.</p> <p>The Associated Press quoted a senior US official as saying Abu Ghadiyah was the leader of the most prolific network that moves foreign fighters linked to al-Qaida into Iraq, and was planning an attack within Iraq. \"The tripwire was knowing an attack was imminent, and also being able to pinpoint his location,\" the official told Associated Press.</p> <p>Officials in Baghdad say the Syrian town targeted during the raid was a major supply line to the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, from where intelligence suggests insurgents are staging what amounts to a last stand in Iraq. Mosul is also seen as a supply line north to Afghanistan, which many in Iraq believe is fast emerging as a new frontline for foreign Arab fighters committed to the global jihad ideology.</p> <p>The Iraqi army now has partial control of Anbar province, which stretches west from Baghdad towards the Syrian border. The province was dubbed the triangle of death in the early days of the US-led occupation and remained a hotbed of militant activity and attacks against coalition forces through four years of often blazing insurgency.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday October 30 2008</strong></p> <p>In the article below we said that a German financial daily, Handelsblatt, had reported that the London-based hedge fund manager Marshall Wace lost more than \u20ac5bn through its short positions on Volkswagen. Marshall Wace has since said that this is incorrect and that its loss is immaterial at less than 0.2% of total funds under management. </p> <p> </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive\">automotive industry</a> is on its knees. General Motors is burning through $1bn a month and is worth a fraction of what it was. Other manufacturers including Ford and Honda are cutting production. </p> <p>But Volkswagen, the business that gave the world the Beetle and the camper van, found itself the most valuable company in the developed world yesterday, the result of another bout of financial speculation that went spectacularly wrong. </p> <p>Panic-buying by hedge funds drove the company's share price into the stratosphere, allowing VW at one point to leapfrog oil giant ExxonMobil to become the biggest company by stockmarket value at just short of a staggering \u20ac300bn (\u00a3240bn). Amid the buying frenzy, the shares touched \u20ac1,005 each, five times the level at which they were changing hands on Friday.</p> <p>VW was worth more than US grocer Wal-Mart, the world's biggest group by sales in this year's Fortune 500 list, Microsoft and General Electric - and substantially more than all of America's and Europe's car-makers combined.</p> <p>But its gain was the hedge funds' loss. The German financial daily Handelsblatt reported that London-based Marshall Wace lost more than \u20ac5bn, and two New York funds, Perry Capital and Greenlight Capital, lost billions each.</p> <p>Amid pandemonium on Frankfurt's stock exchange, VW shares experienced a rollercoaster ride before ending 82% higher on the day at \u20ac945, valuing the group at \u20ac280bn.</p> <p>The panic-buying, which began on Monday, came after hedge funds were caught short by Sunday's announcement from the luxury car-maker Porsche that it had seized 74.1% of VW.</p> <p>With the federal state of Lower Saxony holding a further 20.2% in VW, that left just 5.7% of the firm's shares traded freely. With global car companies in freefall as the recession bites into sales and profits, the funds bet hugely on VW's stock falling dramatically. In market parlance, they \"shorted\" VW shares by \"borrowing\" and then selling them in the hope they could buy them back at a much reduced price.</p> <p>Porsche's announcement forced them to close their positions by chasing the few shares on offer and paying ever-higher prices for them. They dumped stocks in Germany's top companies to pay for scarce VW stock.</p> <p>Some fund managers were reportedly in tears as they realised the scale of their losses - estimated to be as high as \u20ac30bn, and bringing out a large dose of schadenfreude among market watchers. Many funds, derided as asset-stripping locusts in Germany, are facing ruin. This week's frenzied buying of VW shares is the latest stage in the saga of Porsche's single-minded pursuit of VW, a process that has seen the two controlling families, the Piechs and the Porsches, engage in open warfare for control, often indulging in public slanging matches.</p> <p>Porsche made its declaration only days after Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman, settled his differences with Wolfgang Porsche, the smaller company's chairman.</p> <p>The effective takeover by Porsche is an extraordinary coup for a company that almost went bankrupt 15 years ago. VW's annual sales of \u20ac100bn dwarf its \u20ac7.5bn turnover. VW sells 6m cars a year and wants to overtake Toyota as the biggest car firm in the world; Porsche sells 100,000. But Stuttgart-based Porsche enjoys the healthiest profit margins among global car-makers, largely thanks to its obscure financial dealings in swaps and options.</p> <p>Under German corporate law it doesn't have to declare these options, laying it open to the charge that it is taking over VW by stealth. It said on Sunday it would acquire directly more than 50% by December, and 75% in 2009.</p> <p>Porsche's dealings have brought Germany's stockmarket system into disrepute, with investors, fund managers and analysts crying foul and demanding the suspension of VW shares from the Dax index and an inquiry by regulators into alleged manipulation and insider trading.</p> <p>But a Porsche spokesman said the company \"utterly rejects\" these allegations: \"It's the funds themselves which are responsible, with their huge bets on a fall in VW shares which never happened.\"</p> <p>Germany's financial services authority, BaFin, and market regulators held back from direct intervention despite pressure from investors. But a BaFin spokeswoman indicated that the authority was scrutinising the deal very closely, with a possible view to mounting a full investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Poisonous grumbling as human rights types ponder the widely trailed prospect of Professor Chris Greenwood, who advised the government that the war in Iraq was legal, becoming a senior judge in the International Court of Justice. It hardly helps that many who specialise in international law, a small incestuous mob, see him, fairly or unfairly, as the brief most likely to be sympathetic to government. \"It will undermine the credibility of the ICJ,\" carped one. Grumbling at the Commons, too, where MPs critical of the Blair-Bush adventure seem likely to coalesce around an early day motion being prepared by Jeremy Corbyn. \"Anyone we nominate for the international court has got to be cleaner than Caesar's wife,\" he says. \"I'm not sure that someone who gave extremely dodgy advice that cost the lives of half a million people really fits the bill.\" The idea, the MP tells us, smacks of a \"super-gravy train\" much beloved by government.

Bravo!</p> <p>\u2022 Amid much scaremongering over the workings of the Human Rights Act (convicts demand gin and tonic every Saturday, that sort of thing), Amnesty International moved this week to inculcate the basic concepts within children. Artists, actors, publishers and activists met on Monday in London to celebrate a film, book and exhibition, all timed to mark the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We Are All Born Free has cartoons illustrating each of the 30 articles, and already has sales of 250,000 in 30 languages. The film will be shown in 160 cinemas prior to screenings of High School Musical. Famous featured voices include Emilia Fox and Jeremy Irons. The on-screen star is actor Julian Rhind-Tutt, who ventured that every child now \"has the right to a plasma TV with broadband connection in their bedroom\". Few embraced the suggestion. Thirty articles is enough.</p> <p>\u2022 As Ofcom launch its inquiry into the Russell Brand-Jonathan Ross phone call farrago, might now be a good time to point out that, according to his recently published autobiography, Why Do I Say These Things?, Ross had one of his earliest sexual experiences with the family Hoover. And that some while back, Brand pointed out that he - as a boy, not the fully formed lothario we see today - did the same thing. \"I didn't come out about my own experience at the time because I didn't want to spoil his moment in the limelight,\" writes Ross in testimony bound to be seized upon by investigators: it all goes to character, your honour. But was it the same vacuum? That's the story. </p> <p>\u2022 Yes, there are many strands to this imbroglio, as we see from first reaction on the Daily Mail website. \"If Andrew Sachs had been a Muslim, would they have broadcast it?\" asks Chris from Romford. Qu\u00e9?</p> <p>\u2022 But then one of the most distressing things about the controversy is the fact that it could all have been avoided. We do not know who decided to sully the proceedings by inviting Ross, but we do know that his appearance meant disappointment for the man who should have been Brand's very special guest that week, our friend the surrealist Rainbow George. He was lined up to appear by the producer Nic Philps, but at the first indication that Ross was ready to sprinkle his stardust, poor George was jettisoned. The BBC may reflect today that George, for all his faults, would have been a more wholesome guest. He would definitely have been less boastful. \"I haven't shagged anyone or anything for as long as I can remember,\" he tells us. But then he is 68, and his view on life is different. He should take over the show. Turn it round. New man. New start.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Not whether, but how. That was how former care services minister Ivan Lewis once described the purpose of the official evaluation of the 13 individual budget pilot schemes enabling older people and those with disabilities and mental health problems to buy care and support services of their choice with money from different funding streams. </p> <p>They were words worth remembering last week when the final report of the individual budgets evaluation network (Ibsen) was published, for it was far from a wholehearted endorsement of the concept - especially in relation to older people - and it might in other circumstances have forced at least a pause in the government's enthusiastic implementation of the personal budget idea. As it is, the implementation express seems to be on, with no discernible check on the throttle. Phil Hope, Lewis's successor, told the Children and Adult Services conference: \"We know that [the idea] works. We know that it is the right direction of travel.\" Later, he told journalists that he confidently expected personal budgets to be \"the norm\" for users of adult social care by 2011. </p> <p>What did Ibsen find? On the plus side, the researchers from five universities interviewed almost 1,000 budget users and established that they generally welcomed the innovation and felt it gave them more control over their lives. Satisfaction was highest among people with mental health problems and physical disabilities. And the approach was found to be good value for money: the average weekly cost of a budget was \u00a3280, compared with \u00a3300 for traditional social care services, and budgets were judged to be producing better social care outcomes - though not, on the whole, better psychological wellbeing. </p> <p>On the downside, the pooling of funding streams - the characteristic distinguishing \"individual\" budgets from \"personal\" budgets drawing simply on local authority social care money - was discovered to have worked poorly. Most significantly, older people felt that planning and managing their own support was a burden and caused anxiety, and they tended to use their budgets merely to buy traditional services. So worrying did older people find the responsibility that the researchers considered them to have lower wellbeing than if they were having traditional services provided to them. </p> <p>Collection of evidence for the evaluation ended last December. For academics, 10 months represents a brisk turnaround from research to report. But with personalisation of services being driven hard by the \u00a3520m Putting People First (PPF) programme, 10 months turns out to have seen a lot of water flowing under the personal budget bridge. </p> <p>According to the Department of Health, the 13 councils involved in the pilots say now that they have addressed many of the issues raised in regard to older people. Support systems have been put in place to give people greater confidence, and to help in controlling a budget and making more creative and rewarding choices in using it. </p> <p>Whitehall flannel? No, says John Dixon, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and director of adult social care in West Sussex, one of the pilot sites. \"In many authorities, the change that has happened in the last 10 months has been remarkable.\" In West Sussex, there were 140 budget holders last December; today there are more than 900. From early next year, Dixon says, newly eligible social care clients in his county will have no choice other than to have a budget. That's already the case in Manchester. The pace of transformation shows no sign of letting up. </p> <p>However, it remains a moot point whether personal budgets will be the norm everywhere in England by the scheduled end of the PPF programme in 2011 - and whether they will be so for all groups of service users. </p> <p>\u2022 David Brindle is the Guardian's public services editor.</p>",
  "<p>If the club owner Flavio Briatore is playing a role in QPR's team selection perhaps it is not the negative influence that it may seem. After Rangers became the first side to take a point away from the Madejski Stadium against Reading on Saturday, Samuel Di Carmine's thunderous strike last night gave the west Londoners, reduced to 10 men after Mikele Leigertwood's sending-off just before half-time, a win that knocked the league leaders, Birmingham, off the top at a rain-and-snow-swept Loftus Road. Maybe this managerial lark isn't so tough after all.</p> <p>\"I didn't think I could beat the emotion of Saturday but we did tonight,\" said the caretaker manager, Gareth Ainsworth, who confirmed that discussions over the make-up of his side do take place behind the scenes but that the final decision on the starting XI is his. \"We have something going here at the moment. Everybody is pulling together and backing each other. I'm very proud of every player.\"</p> <p>The result will do Ainsworth's chances of taking the job long-term no harm - as the Birmingham manager, Alex McLeish, pointed out, \"You could see players were fighting for him\" - although he remains an outside bet. Briatore, nearing a year in charge of the club and searching for his third manager after the departures of Luigi De Canio in the summer and Iain Dowie last week, is thought to favour the Robertos Mancini and Donadoni or Gianluca Vialli, while the Peterborough manager, Darren Ferguson, is a domestic possibility. No suitors appeared to be in the directors' box last night.</p> <p>Ainsworth said that he had thrown himself into the role \"full blast\", and it certainly appeared that way last night as, watched intently by Briatore from the touchline, he helped loft long balls for his centre-halves to head clear during the warm-up and stood directing and cajoling from the technical area throughout, despite the blizzard that developed as the game wore on. \"I've got a taste for it,\" he said of his fledgling managerial role. \"It's something I want to pursue in my career, but at the moment we're taking it game by game.\"</p> <p>His team, though they matched his endeavour, initially struggled to match the league leaders' incisiveness. Despite Gary O'Connor pulling out after an injury in the warm-up and Stuart Parnaby being carried off with a hamstring strain inside 15 minutes, Birmingham twice forced early chances. Cameron Jerome should have done much better when clean through and Kevin Phillips drew a superb save from Radek Cerny with a rasping volley.</p> <p>Having survived that scare QPR began to disrupt Birmingham's control and Maik Taylor was forced into two smart saves, both from Martin Rowlands, before the break. But it appeared that the building momentum would be dissipated with the red card for Leigertwood for a high, studs-up challenge on Lee Carsley on the stroke of half-time.</p> <p>Rangers, though, responded in the best possible fashion within 10 minutes of the restart. Damiano Tommasi, the former Italian international midfielder making his first appearance for the club, caused trouble down the right and cut the ball inside for Di Carmine to unleash an unstoppable drive from 25 yards that flew into the top corner to put Ainsworth's side 1-0 up. Less than a minute later they were fortunate to hold on to the lead when Phillips' shot hit the unaware Gavin Mahon on the line.</p> <p>Though Phillips had a goal ruled out for offside in the last of the four minutes of injury-time, the onslaught expected from a team attempting to hold on to their grip at the summit failed to materialise, much to the irritation of McLeish. \"Our performance was a big disappointment,\" he said after his side's second league defeat of the season saw Wolves replace them at the top of the league. \"But we won't panic.\"</p>",
  "<p>A revolution in slow motion, the climate change bill has been two years in the making. In 2006 Friends of the Earth began a campaign, which was picked up first by the Conservatives and soon after by the government, for a law committing Britain to a sharp cut in greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday evening the bill finished its Commons stages. It was a radical moment, unmatched anywhere else in the world, the drama only slightly diminished by the threadbare debate that preceeded it. </p> <p>With the law comes a new reality. Parliament has set demanding targets and deserves congratulation for that. But it has barely begun the task of finding a way to meet them. All the laws in the world will not stop carbon levels soaring to dangerous levels if they do not lead to policy action. The long passage of the bill has been something of a placebo, giving the impression of progress without, so far, producing much in reality. The new climate change secretary, Ed Miliband (whose brother David originally gave the bill government backing) has been admirably ambitious, accepting that aviation and shipping emissions should, in some form, be included in overall reduction targets and raising the proposed cut in greenhouse gases by 2050 from 60% to 80%. He now has to show that these impressive goals can be something more than legislative fantasy.</p> <p>The low-carbon future always seems to begin tomorrow. If the law works as it should, governments will have no option other than to get it under way today. It should be a straitjacket, binding departments into policies they would not otherwise follow: no new third runway at Heathrow, and no new coal power station at Kingsnorth. But the shame of busting five-yearly carbon budgets may turn out to be much smaller than the political pain caused by enforcing emissions reductions. The call from both main parties for lower petrol prices is just a small hint of contradictions to come.</p> <p>In the meantime, the task of mitigating climate change is getting harder. Yesterday's Living Planet report from WWF International warned that human demands on the planet's resources have doubled in 45 years, and that 75% of people live in countries that demand more resources than they can provide. The new Garnaut report from Australia warns that emissions are running away, increasing by 3% a year to 2030, making a mockery of British targets. Some scientists are close to panic: a recent collection of essays from the Royal Society suggested targets will never be met, and that the world should attempt \"geoscale\" interventions instead, such as dimming the sun. That sounds like fantasy. The better alternative is to make the climate change law work.</p>",
  "<p>Jacqui Smith's announcement yesterday of tougher measures to exclude \"preachers of hate\" is the latest in a series of initiatives to prevent young British Muslims turning to violent extremism. A mushrooming array of guidelines for schools, colleges and councils emphasises the need to challenge the narrative al-Qaida uses to attract recruits.</p> <p>These guidelines do nothing to challenge the dominant narrative by which violent extremism is commonly explained, a narrative that sees even peaceful groups as transmission belts on which insecure Muslims are shuffled towards violence. However, there is a very different narrative of British Islam, which the government is less keen to talk about. There is a reason for that.</p> <p>The dominant story is of a second generation who grew up in the Paki-bashing 80s and suffered a profound identity crisis on reaching adulthood. Torn between the culturally based Islam of their families and the pressures of contemporary society, these Muslims proved easy prey for radicalisation by exiled clerics from hardline groups, who presented a narrative of historical oppression going back to the Crusades.</p> <p>With variants, that model is put forward by rightwing thinktanks, Conservative ideologues, former Hizb ut-Tahrir activists and erstwhile leftwingers. At its core is the idea that even non-violent organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain and those connected with groups like the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood are on what the former left commentator Nick Cohen calls \"a continuum whose terminus is pathological hatred\". Or, as Newsnight's Richard Watson puts it: \"Today's suicide bombers are yesterday's Islamists.\"</p> <p>That narrative is powerfully countered in Race &amp; Class, the journal of the Institute of Race Relations (on whose board I sit). Arun Kundnani's article starts from the identity crisis of second-generation Muslims - but takes it in a very different direction. </p> <p>He explains the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood ideologue Sayyid Qutb, not in terms of his (undoubted) social fundamentalism, but of his insistence that it's up to individual Muslims how to interpret their religion. Echoing the Protestant reformation, Qutb advocated a global Islam, liberated from national forms. His vision gives Muslims an attachment to a world community; it is compatible with many aspects of modernity; and, on a personal level, it gives Muslims an Islamic excuse not to marry their cousins.</p> <p>For some, this blend of globalism and individualism explains the attraction of political Islam to the 7/7 bombers. But it also explains the trajectory of other Muslims, who have moved from youthful militancy towards a very different kind of engagement, a trajectory of which involvement in the anti-Iraq war movement is an obvious example.</p> <p>For Cohen, the Stop the War Coalition is an unholy alliance of a demoralised, morally relativist left and an \"Islamist far right\". If that were true, you would expect the left to sell out to Islamism on issues such as women's and gay rights, free speech and antisemitism, while the Islamists remained ideologically steadfast. In fact, far from dragging duped progressives towards a hardline Islamist agenda, much of the intellectual movement has been the other way.</p> <p>So, as Catholics picketed parliament for the right to discriminate against gay couples, the MCB issued a statement supporting the legislation on the grounds that, despite Islam's opposition to homosexuality, it \"stands opposed to discrimination in all its forms\". Rightly, and not before time, the MCB has lifted its boycott of Holocaust Day. In a Guardian article last year, the former Young Muslim student activist Inayat Bunglawala (now of the MCB) reiterated the importance of the anti-Satanic Verses campaign, but said that he was wrong to call for it to be banned. Similarly, the MCB didn't call for the banning of Fitna, the anti-Islam film by the Dutch MP Geert Wilders, on the grounds that (as Bunglawala put it), the \"same freedoms which allow Wilders to taunt Muslims so openly are also the ones which allow Muslims and others to spread the teachings of their faith\". </p> <p>The co-chair of the February 2003 Iraq war march, Anas Altikriti of the British Muslim Initiative, points out that the Qur'an says nothing about homosexuality beyond relaying the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Birmingham Respect councillor Salma Yaqoob has consistently opposed bans of and protests against anti-Muslim material. Influenced by Abdelwahab El-Affendi (author of Who Needs an Islamic State?) and the international scholar Tariq Ramadan, these Muslims are seeking to build a distinctly European Islam that sits easily with western pluralism and its political processes, without having to sacrifice the essentials of their beliefs.</p> <p>So why is this narrative not trumpeted in the myriad guidelines on combating extremism? It's not Muslim views on halal meat or the hijab that bother the government, but their views on other matters. All these activists oppose the government's attacks on civil liberties. Like the 7/7 bombers, they were politicised not by Afghanistan or Iraq but by the Bosnian war, and the sight of western countries standing by while Muslims were dispossessed, raped and murdered on Europe's eastern doorstep. They see no reason to keep quiet about their views of western foreign policy now. As Yaqoob puts it, the huge support for the February 2003 march - particularly from middle England - led many Muslims to feel they belonged to Britain for the first time. </p> <p>On these pages, Ziauddin Sardar has argued that the problem with the ex-Islamist Quilliam Foundation is not that it is anti-fundamentalist or anti-segregationist, but that it is anti-political; it wants Muslims to keep quiet. In fact, as Kundnani argues, a whole generation of British Muslims has rejected \"the folkoric religio-cultural practices of their parents\" in search of new ways of being Muslim, in public, in contemporary Europe.

  "<p>Your article uses statistics from the grammar school application system in Kent as evidence that the so-called credit crunch is putting a financial squeeze on parents in the affluent south-east (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/18/schooladmissions-grammarschools\">Rush for places in best state schools as fee-payers feel the pinch</a>, October 18). \"Figures seen by the Guardian,\" you report, \"reveal that Kent ... has seen a 20% rise in the numbers of pupils sitting the 11-plus.\"</p> <p>Tempting as it may be to look at these figures and conclude that there is a flood of parents seeking to cut costs by reverting to state secondary schools, your article fails to take into account recent changes to the application system, which have reduced the risks for those who take the 11-plus exam but fail it. It is therefore too simplistic to equate a steep rise in applications for the 11-plus test to families being \"put off private schools in the economic downturn\".</p> <p>You also report, as if it were somehow a novel phenomenon, that parents are abandoning independent schools around the 11-plus because grammars represent \"a free alternative to private school\". As a parent of primary-age children in Kent, I have lost count of the number of others who have opted to shun a perfectly good state primary in order to transfer their child to a private school. </p> <p>They do this in the short term in order that their offspring can be parachuted back into the state sector via a desirable grammar school at secondary level. This is common practice for those who have the means or inclination to fund part, but not all, of their child's education.</p> <p>Fiona Millar, described as a campaigner for state schools, is quoted in the article as saying: \"Most people would say pupils coming from the independent sector back to state schools would be a good thing if it meant schools began to reflect their local communities.\" This is not a sentiment I share. Here, pupils who have been groomed for re-entry to free grammar school places by private education are a cause of resentment, not celebration. </p> <p>My children's school informed parents that, as a state school, it is not permitted by law to coach children for the 11-plus, and it offers scant support for parents who wish their child to take the test. I don't blame the school for this; why should it get involved? Private primary schools, on the other hand, earn much of their livelihood tapping into parental anxiety and, furthermore, they can teach for the 11-plus. </p> <p>So, I can't find it in my heart to welcome those from the independent schools back - they should stand by the state system in the first place and not skew the situation unfairly for everybody else.</p> <p>All in all, next year's schools statistics will provide more of an accurate indication as to whether parents are truly \"feeling the pinch\". My feeling, though, is that as long as a two-tier education system exists, such as in Kent, parents will find the means to do whatever it takes to help their child get to a grammar school, credit crunch or not.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bliss is a parent whose children attend a state school in Kent <a href=\"mailto:cathbliss@wkc.ac.uk\">cathbliss@wkc.ac.uk</a></p>"
