  "<p>In the 1960s and early 70s, a wave of espionage movies - serious and farcical - swept across the cinemas and TV screens of the Western world, reflecting changing attitudes towards the Cold War. James Bond was pre-eminent but in his wake came, among many others, Michael Caine's Harry Palmer, James Coburn's Derek Flint, Dean Martin's Matt Helm, Robert Vaughn and David McCallum's men from U.N.C.L.E. and David Niven's Jason Love.</p> <p>When the tide had gone out, the last man standing was 007 and with a variety of canny transfusions he's been there ever since, eventually, with Casino Royale, becoming serious again as Fleming intended him to be. </p> <p>Most forgotten of all is Neil Connery in the 1967 spoof Operation Kid Brother (aka OK Connery). But it made little impression at the time, unlike the largely forgotten comedy series Get Smart, which developed a cult following. It ran for 138 half-hour episodes between 1965 and 1970 and starred Don Adams as Maxwell Smart, the accident- prone intelligence genius who worked in Washington DC for the top secret US agency CONTROL, whose deadly enemy was the nefarious Eastern European terrorist organisation KAOS.</p> <p>Created by two gifted writer-performers, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, it combined the broad humour of the first with the subtler comedy of the latter. The show has now been revived as a feature-length film, also called <strong>Get Smart</strong>, lasting as long as four episodes of the TV programme, and starring Steve Carell as Smart.</p> <p>The film is directed by Peter Segal with as heavy a hand as the one at the end of Hellboy's right arm. A budget not much short of a Bond movie makes possible sets, chases and assorted pyrotechnics on the scale of a major action picture. Sadly, the vein of comic gold mined by the TV series is exhausted and the result is staggeringly unfunny from start to finish. One admires Alan Arkin, one of the screen's great deadpan artists, for his restraint as the head of CONTROL, but he doesn't get many laughs. Bill Murray, another great put-on artist, turns up as an agent hidden inside a tree near the White House, but he's come and gone in seconds. </p> <p>James Caan, as the US President targeted by KAOS, attempts to elicit chuckles by saying 'nucular' and reading nursery rhymes to schoolkids at a moment of national crisis, but by then the audience is anaesthetised. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry are credited as consultants. Their advice should have been: 'Don't do it.'<br></p>",
  "<p>Another morning's newspapers, another cacophony of headlines for the Ciccone-Ritchies to ignore as they sit down to breakfast at one of their many houses. </p> <p>Today, Friday 15 August, a Hollywood psychic is reporting that Madonna's eldest child, 11-year-old Lourdes, is the reincarnation of Argentine stateswoman Eva Peron - the portrayal of whom, lest we forget, earned Madge the least bad reviews of her stop-start acting career. Meanwhile, guests at Madonna's 50th birthday party, taking place in London the next day, have been barred from giving cards or presents featuring the number 50; otherwise 'they face the wrath of the muscle-bound Material Girl'. Seemingly this is not just rock-star vanity: according to the teachings of Kabbalah, in terms of her spiritual age Madonna is only 36. Never mind, there will be other distractions at the bash, courtesy of Guy Ritchie's gift. 'He wanted to get her the one thing she really wanted. And the one thing that she has put on hold for him has been adopting another child.'</p> <p>Elsewhere in tabloid-land, today also finds a harem-scarem Germaine Greer wondering if Madonna's 'much-touted link with Alex Rodriguez, third baseman for the New York Yankees', is a stunt to flog tickets for her upcoming world tour. Greer also laments the loss of Eighties Madonna and her 'sharp wit'. 'And in the middle of all this,' Greer wibbles on, 'Guy Ritchie starts making himself scarce, as husbands faced with wives who are uncontrollable tend to do.'</p> <p>The morning brings equally troubling news for said scarpered hubby: according to reports from America, the director's new film is in trouble before it's even been released. Joel Silver, producer of the Warner Brothers-funded RocknRolla, has been screening it to rival distributors. Seems that Alan Horn, president of the studio, has decreed that Ritchie's London-set gangster flick (yes, another one) is not deserving of a 'wide' theatrical release and therefore he won't be spending much money marketing it. Hence, allegedly, Silver trying to find a more appreciative home for RocknRolla.</p> <p>How do you feel about that, I ask Ritchie, as we meet in a Soho hotel for a 10am interview.</p> <p>'Well, first of all I like Warner Brothers very much. They've been very good to me,' he replies. He's about to begin shooting his next film, a Sherlock Holmes story with Robert Downey Jr in the title role, and that's a Warner Brothers project. 'And I like and respect Alan very much. I mean, they're still talking about an 800-screen release [in the US]. If it's on 800 screens that's bigger than what I would do anyway - I would go smaller. So there's not much I can say.' </p> <p>Actually, Horn has said, 'I don't see it starting out on 800 screens.' He also said that the film is not 'broadly commercial', is 'very English', and only has 'funny spots'. Does Ritchie agree with him? </p> <p>'I don't. It's obviously very English. But I'm not sure if that... I mean, Harry Potter's very English isn't it? Bond's very English. But no, I just, I just... I'm not sure if Alan quite knows what to do with it.'</p> <p>As you're now going in to filming on the Sherlock Holmes movie, won't this affect the trust you have in the studio?</p> <p>'No, no. I understand how Alan feels about it.' But Ritchie says that the American preview screenings of RocknRolla have gone well - just as they did with Snatch (2000), the Brad Pitt-starring follow-up to his 1998 debut Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Unlike his disastrous third and fourth movies, Swept Away (2002) and Revolver (2005), Snatch was a success in the US. This time, 'my job was to make a film in the same genre as Snatch. So, that's all I can do.'</p> <p>Like the plot of one of his films, arranging this interview has been a complete palaver. Our appointment might happen in his Shaftesbury Avenue office. No, it won't, the office is too busy. It'll happen Wednesday. No, it'll happen today, Monday, in a couple of hours - am I free? No, I am not. It'll happen Friday, honest. Well, it had better, because that's right on deadline. 'You won't ask about Madonna will you?' comes the PR query. 'And will you ask about Alan Horn?' As one of his characters - Hatchet Harry, say, or Frankie Four Fingers - might say, a right old ding-dong, innit? </p> <p>Which is a shame. There's a lot of ground to cover with Guy Ritchie. Plus, he's famously tongue-tied in interviews, a legacy of his severe dyslexia, his historical confusion about who he is (mockney geezer or well-connected posh boy?), and his wariness of talking about The Missus too much. Plus, RocknRolla is good, and it would have been interesting to have a decent conversation about it. Sure, it's another fast-paced, fast-edited skid round a London of roguish ne'er-do-wells sporting panto nicknames and crimelords with inventively psychopathic tendencies. But unlike Swept Away - his sado-masochistic-chauvinistic remake of a Seventies Italian potboiler which starred Madonna as a super-rich bitch who abuses then falls in love with a studly peasant after he abuses her - RocknRolla is not straight-to-DVD laughable. Unlike Revolver - his self-scripted story of feuding gangs, chess, the power of the ego and how your biggest enemy lies inside you (or something) - it's not bafflingly pretentious and silly. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336842031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2008/08/21/richie460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Richie \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Ritchie on set for his latest film RocknRolla. Photograph: Warner Bros</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Brothers/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two of the characters, One Two (300's Gerard Butler) and Mumbles (The Wire's Idris Elba), are lovable dodgy geezers. They borrow money from a ganglord (Tom Wilkinson) for a scam but - guess what? - it goes wrong. Enter an Abramovich-style Russian oligarch with an office in - where else? - Wembley Stadium. He has his eyes on London's booming property market, and he has the billions and the tooled-up ex-Soviet army hoods to prove it. Old gangster ways meet new gangster ways; bloody, bullet-ridden chaos ensues. The menagerie of characters also includes a crooked but sexy accountant (Thandie Newton), a nice-guy enforcer (Mark Strong) and, giving the film its title, a drug-addled rock star named Johnny Quid (Control's Toby Kebbell).</p> <p>'It seemed pertinent to make something about property,' says Ritchie as he sips tea, the picture of sturdy composure. He thinks the infusion of foreign money and foreign gangs has changed the skyline and the underbelly of his city (though he was born just north of the capital, in Hatfield). Is RocknRolla a lament for a lost London, where crime was more honest?</p> <p>'Yeah, I suppose to a degree. Crime has become corporate and international. The thing about a corporation is, it's blind. The bigger things get, even if they are legal infrastructures, they're blind in their greed. They have one agenda. And I suppose that's happened globally. So what we used to understand as crime, I'm not sure we recognise as crime any more.'</p> <p>After Lock, Stock and Snatch, Guy Ritchie was insistent he wouldn't do a third London gangster film. But here we are again. He's even said that he's already written a sequel to RocknRolla. Why did he change his mind? </p> <p>'Probably because I realised people wanted one. Partly because I know I can do one. And... there was a story there, a story about the evolving London.'</p> <p>Might RocknRolla also mark a return to safe, profitable territory for Ritchie? Lock, Stock was a significant hit, the cinematic equivalent of the then-dominant Britpop: smart, fast, hip, leery, fun. Shortly after its release Ritchie met Madonna at a dinner hosted by Trudie Styler, Sting's wife and one of the film's producers. Before long they were married (at Skibo Castle in the Highlands), she was pregnant with their son Rocco, and both had taken to a cosy old English existence straight out of Country Life: huntin', shootin', flatcap-wearin' and fallin' off horses.</p> <p>Buoyed by a top-notch cast including Pitt and Benicio del Toro, Snatch also did good box-office. Ritchie was on a roll. The erstwhile pop video maker was the future of British cinema. Then came Swept Away and Revolver, indulgent disasters both. Does he think Swept Away would have worked better if Madonna wasn't in it?</p> <p>'Um, well...' He struggles for the appropriate words, or just the politic ones. 'It's impossible not to take her fame out of the equation - and I suppose I was incredibly naive about that,' he says, a rare concession from this solidly self-assured man with the tree-trunk upper arms (he tries to do ju-jitsu for an hour every day). 'The thing was,' he continues, 'it was a very low-budget film, and it was designed as a very small thing - but there's no such thing when she's involved. So... I just don't accept that's a bad film. It's exactly the film I intended to make. It's supposed to be ironic, and the most politically incorrect film of its period. But the irony was lost by the enormity of her fame, I suppose.'</p> <p>He's even more swaggering about Revolver. Ask him what went wrong with it and Ritchie fires back: 'I don't think anything went wrong with Revolver. By its very nature it's an esoteric movie. It's not designed for the masses.' It was universally savaged by the critics - was that a disappointment?</p> <p>'I was disappointed in the respect that...' he begins. 'I'm not sure if the film was being slagged off as much as...' He stops. 'We got caught up in the zeitgeist of slaggery, so it was clearly at some point not about the film. And I just don't accept it's a bad film. I know how to make a film. So to say it's a bad film, to say it's constructed badly or anything - it's just not.'</p> <p>He understands that people don't understand it. 'But it is all about [the fact] that your mind can't understand it... To me it's based on one simple premise: that your mind is designed to reject reality. Well, I didn't know that. Did you know that?'</p> <p>I didn't know that.</p> <p>'No,' he nods, his defiance now coming with a little triumphant boost. 'The fact that you don't know that is an interesting position to start - you can't believe in your own beliefs.'</p> <p>No regrets then, even though it set back your career?</p> <p>'I don't think it has set my career back. You're on your path, right, in terms of what it is you're doing. I no longer believe that what appears to be bad for you is necessarily bad for you. No, it was the film I wanted to make - and it is actually the film I like the most.'</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>'But it's a different type of film. RocknRolla's easy. Revolver isn't easy. But I don't wanna make easy films necessarily.' </p> <p>Mark Strong has, perhaps, a clearer perspective. As well as appearing in RocknRolla he was in Revolver (playing a stammering hitman), and lived to tell the tale. </p> <p>'There was much more energy about this film,' says Strong. 'Revolver at times felt like a big production that was sailing along taking its time. Where did it go wrong? It's very simple: filmmaking is storytelling and if it's too complicated you lose the audience. Guy knew the story and that film is threaded through with some deep thoughts. But they weren't conveyed clearly.'</p> <p>Strong says that Revolver was trying to be 'deeper and darker' than Lock, Stock and Snatch, 'and it backfired. So Guy realised: I now understand what they want and I'm gonna do another one of those.'</p> <p>I'm still unclear why Guy Ritchie was so elusive in setting up an interview to promote a film that, in many ways, marks his comeback - not least because the film's lead actor, Gerard Butler, is curiously unavailable for interview, as is the film's breakout star, Toby Kebbell. Sure, Ritchie's also busy with pre-production on his Sherlock Holmes movie, which starts filming in October, and this week he's been in Liverpool, scouting locations. He pronounces himself unworried about a rival film, starring Sacha Baron Cohen ('the trouble there is there isn't a script'). What about the Kabbalah documentary which was meant to be released in 2006?</p> <p>'I'm still making that. There's nothing simple about that.'</p> <p>Why is it taking so long?</p> <p>'Cause there's nothing simple about it.'</p> <p>Madonna is, obviously, an adherent and Ritchie has participated in some of the Judaist faith's ceremonies. As a documentary maker, is it a subject he can be objective about?</p> <p>'I like to think so,' he replies evenly. 'I've got a little team of lads and they pretty much put it together. I come in and have a look every now and then, see if it makes sense.'</p> <p>Would he describe himself as a follower of Kabbalah?</p> <p>'No, I wouldn't, no. I like to think I'm an objective guy. I have sympathies with many philosophies, and I think it'd be a mistake to be a follower of anything, really.'</p> <p>People assume that because Madonna is a follower, it's a point of tension in their marriage. </p> <p>'I just think any intelligent human being has to remain, if you can, objective. I like the idea that everyone's free to think what it is they think as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.'</p> <p>Ritchie unhurriedly pours himself another cup of tea, but our time's nearly up. He's not been as chippy as I feared - he's chatty and interested in my Scottish roots, he tells me his dad's family are all from Scotland - and I can understand something of what Mark Strong had said. 'He's in an impossible situation,' Strong told me - meaning, by dint of his straight-out-of-the-traps success and because of who he's married to, Ritchie is judged by standards that don't apply to most directors. 'The fact that he's stayed sane and is such a lovely bloke is a miracle. I read this bullshit written about him and her and it bears no relationship to reality. He is thoughtful, kind and funny, yet the way he's portrayed is unbelievable.'</p> <p>Before I go, I ask Ritchie for his quickfire comment on some of the newspaper reports pertaining to him and Madonna. </p> <p>Is your pub [The Punchbowl, in London's Mayfair] overcharging tourists?</p> <p>'I hope so!'</p> <p>After adopting David two years ago, are you and Madonna trying to adopt another child from Malawi, named Mercy?</p> <p>'Possibly.'</p> <p>Your recent rants about the evils of sugar during an interview with a film magazine - they were a dig at Madonna, whose current album is called Hard Candy and whose tour, starting next week, is called Sticky and Sweet.</p> <p>[Smiles] 'Were they? I hadn't even heard that - I think I was talking about sugar being bad for your fucking teeth.'</p> <p>According to Christopher Ciccone's recent book/expos\u00e9 about his now-estranged sister, you're a homophobe who, among other things, gave the gay, sometime interior designer a lot of trouble about a closet you wanted built.</p> <p>'Really? Was that a metaphorical closet? What do I make of that book? I don't make anything of the book. The poor chap wrote it out of desperation. I don't think it'd be intelligent to comment on that. I can't give too much equity [sic] in what the chap's gonna write in that book. But,' he concludes with a grin, 'you'd be hard pushed to be a homophobe and marry Madonna.'</p> <p>Time's up. Is Guy Ritchie up to his eyes with planning the wife's no-doubt-spectacular birthday celebrations?</p> <p>'Um, I'm involved in paying for 'em!'</p> <p>Now, he really must dash. If the tabloids are to be believed, he has an adopted orphan to wrap.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> RocknRolla is released on 5 September</p>",
  "<p>I suppose technically this wasn't my crap holiday but it certainly felt like it. It was in fact a camping holiday last month in north Devon for our daughters Claire and Jane and their families. Claire borrowed our car as it is slightly bigger than hers. </p> <p>All seemed to go well for the first two days except that Claire, who has severe allergies, lost her fragrance-free shampoo in the showers (\u00a38 a bottle) and then lost her favourite top coming back from the showers. They say things go in threes and I guess they are right because the next day, Arlie, our 22-month-old grandson, tried dancing in the shower, fell over and broke his leg.</p> <p>Driving to the accident and emergency unit, our son-in-law Peter scraped the side of our car. He was under stress and we have forgiven him. He then had to follow the ambulance to the hospital, where Arlie was put in traction and Claire spent the next three days sleeping on a campbed next to her son. Because of her allergies she survived on crisps and chips.</p> <p>Meanwhile, her husband and five-year-old son spent their holiday driving backwards and forwards to the hospital.</p> <p>And it rained.</p> <p>Back at the campsite Jane and her husband, with Charlotte, six, and Oliver, 14 months, arrived in the rain. Reception had no record of the location of Claire's tent despite the reservation having been made for the two tents to be side by side. </p> <p>Oliver had broken out in spots and Charlotte was sick in the car while Dad struggled in the rain for two hours to put up their new tent. And the tent leaked.</p> <p>And it rained even harder.</p> <p>Arlie had an operation and had both legs in plaster. Back on the campsite Oliver's spots were worse and he cried all night. And it just carried on raining.</p> <p>Arlie was discharged from hospital so in a bit of a rush the tent was taken down. The car was packed but the car keys were missing. The car was unpacked and re-packed three times but still no keys. In desperation, Peter went through the dustbin for a second time and EUREKA!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Oliver had been diagnosed with a bad case of chickenpox.</p> <p>I am glad to say both families got home safely and Oliver and Arlie are doing well, though it is still raining. <br><strong>Elaine Connor</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Have you had a crap holiday?

You can be born fat, and I thank God I wasn't. </p> <p><strong>Do you worry about your weight?</strong> </p> <p>If I could go to the gym to get the body of a junkie, I would. I like skinny.

The sex in my movies is always ludicrous. A Dirty Shame was about every kind of sexual perversion, like the sexual attraction to dirt.

I smoked swimming, I set the bed on fire. As for drugs, I've tried everything. I did heroin once so I could listen to jazz, but I hated the idea of sitting around nodding and puking.

  "<p>Hundreds of thousands of credit card users are set to see the minimum repayment on their plastic rocket to \u00a325, a move that could hurt households struggling to repay their debts.</p> <p>In October, credit card customers at Alliance &amp; Leicester will see their minimum repayment terms switch from the lesser of 3 per cent or \u00a35 plus any interest charges to the greater of \u00a325 or \u00a35 plus any interest charges.</p> <p>While any move that shrinks the size of the underlying debt is to be welcomed, the hike will concern many households whose budget doesn't stretch immediately to such levels.</p> <p>The changes will chiefly affect users with 0 per cent cards who have been paying the \u00a35 minimum but now face a huge jump to \u00a325, and those managing smaller credit card balances.</p> <p>In particular, lower-income households in careful control of their finances could find their monthly repayments leap to unmanageable levels.</p> <p>A cash-strapped customer slowly paying off a \u00a3200 balance on a card with a standard annual percentage rate (APR) of roughly 16 per cent using the minimum repayment would currently pay about \u00a36 - the 3 per cent fee. That will jump to \u00a325; for homes where the daily finances are finely balanced, it could cause financial difficulties on top of soaring fuel and food bills.</p> <p>'Such a move could cause problems with people who are managing their debt carefully, especially when everybody's income is so much tighter,' says Sean Gardner at price comparison site <a href=\"http://www.Moneyexpert.com\">Moneyexpert.com</a>. 'And because people are becoming more stretched, an increasing number are now paying back the minimum.'</p> <p>MBNA, the credit card company that provides A&amp;L with its cards, will roll out the same changes to other lenders it supplies, including Virgin Money and its own-brand customers.</p> <p>'From a customer's point of view, the change is a good thing as the more debt they pay off, the better,' says an MBNA spokesman. 'But clearly, if some people can't afford to pay [the new minimum repayment] then they can come to us and we'll try to resolve it.'</p> <p>But although the higher \u00a325 minimum repayment could cause a measure of financial distress, the greater monthly sums will chip away faster at outstanding debt and slash the overall amount of interest to be paid.</p> <p>Repaying credit card debt by spending just the minimum amount each month - usually 2.25 per cent of the outstanding sum - can leave you in debt for decades. Yet about 3.38 million people (11 per cent of borrowers in Britain) make only the minimum repayment, compared to 20.9 million (68 per cent) who repay their credit card bill in full, according to figures from the British payments body Apacs.</p> <p>The danger stems from lenders' allowing borrowers to pay back a tiny percentage of the outstanding debt each month, rather than sticking to a set payment that eats into the underlying amount owing. This way, interest can continue to build up in the bank's coffers as the debt is slowly eroded over many years.</p> <p>If you have the average UK credit card balance of \u00a31,384 at 18.9 per cent and make the 2.25 per cent minimum repayment each month, it would take you a staggering 27 years and eight months to pay it all off; worse, you would pay \u00a32,673 in interest charges, research by finance website <a href=\"http://www.Moneynet.co.uk\">Moneynet.co.uk</a> shows.</p> <p>'Imagine someone told you that your \u00a31,384 purchase would cost you a total of \u00a34,057 (including interest) and would take you nearly three decades to repay, you would think you'd be mad to entertain such a buy. But because consumers don't appreciate the real cost of their credit-card spending with low minimum repayments, many will just carry on regardless,' says spokesman Andrew Hagger.</p> <p>'While credit cards, used correctly, can be a great way to ease a temporary cash flow problem, they can prove to be a real financial albatross if you slip into the habit of only repaying the absolute minimum.'</p> <p>Not every one will be fortunate enough to owe sums that tally with the national average, though, and for those owing thousands on a credit card, the minimum repayment trap can get ludicrously expensive. </p> <p>According to consumer revenge website <a href=\"http://www.Moneysavingexpert.com\">Moneysavingexpert.com</a>, a \u00a33,000 debt at 17.9 per cent on a 2 per cent minimum repayment (\u00a360 in your first monthly payment) would take 41 years to pay off and cost \u00a36,400 in interest alone.</p> <p>Debt charities, which have seen record numbers of heavily indebted individuals get in touch for advice on coping with their borrowing - which include credit cards, store credit, personal loans and loans secured on homes - are recommending that clients pay more than the minimum, even if it is just a few extra pounds each month.</p> <p>Take that same balance of \u00a31,384 at 18.9 per cent and minimum repayments of 2.25 per cent: if a borrower was to make the minimum repayment and an additional \u00a310 each month, the time taken to repay the debt would shrivel by 20 years to seven years and eight months, and the borrower would pay just \u00a3890 in interest charges, Moneynet's research shows.</p> <p>'It can make such a massive difference, and so we always advise people to pay over by a slight amount, even if it's just a couple of pounds,' says Frances Walker at the Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) debt charity. 'The real problems begin if you've more than one card and you are paying the minimum on both; you can get locked in for years and years. It really is a mug's game; you absolutely need to clear as much as possible.' </p> <p>On a brighter note, the average minimum repayment as a percentage is beginning to creep up, according to financial analyst Moneyfacts. This year, so far it stands at 2.66 per cent - \u00a37.63 a month - while standing at 2.58 per cent in 2007 and 2.47 per cent in 2006.</p> <p>'While some lenders have reduced their minimum payments, there have been significant increases such as that by MBNA. It is a good sign that they are increasing, but the minimum percentage has only increased slightly, which is unlikely to outweigh the increase in purchase rates and cash APRs,' says Samantha Owens of Moneyfacts. </p> <p>Only two card lenders - Capital One and Coutts, the private bank - insist on a 5 per cent minimum repayment, and the Capital One 'Classic' Visa card carries a monster 34.9 per cent APR. 'It's aimed at people trying to rebuild their credit history,' says Mr Hagger. 'With a rate this high the customer would never repay their balance if the minimum was 2.25 per cent.'</p> <p>Any one who is in serious trouble and struggling to juggle credit card debts while relying on minimum repayments, should consider contacting the CCCS on 0800 138 1111 for free advice or getting in touch with their local Citizens Advice Bureau.</p> <p>As a rule, Ms Walker recommends paying off the most expensive credit card debt first if you have more than one, and - if possible - trying to shift your existing debt to a new card that offers a cheap balance-transfer deal.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could set up a direct debit to make sure that you never miss a credit card repayment - an omission that picks up a \u00a312 fine - and then make overpayments by telephone or direct from your current account each month.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who claims to be able to drive well and talk on a mobile phone at the same time is lying. In fact, any boast of competence on the road is a good indication that someone is a terrible driver. It suggests he - and it probably is a he - has no idea how hard driving is. To underestimate the challenge is always to be on the brink of suicide or manslaughter.</p> <p>Our bodies have not evolved to move much faster than 20mph. At higher speeds, our senses, our reactions, our risk-assessing antennae don't work properly. So when we get behind the wheel of a car, stripped of critical faculties and clad in mechanical armour, we become simultaneously more stupid and more powerful. It is a combination that does not bring out the best in humanity, as Tom Vanderbilt discovers in Traffic, a breezily profound investigation into, as the book's subtitle puts it, Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What it Says About Us). If the topic sounds banal, that is rather the point: we have become desensitised to the awesome complexity of life on the road. </p> <p>Manoeuvring through traffic is one of the most mentally taxing things any of us does. Vanderbilt meets engineers who have tried unsuccessfully to build robots capable of doing it. The sheer volume of sensory data is too much for the most sophisticated artificial brain. But then, Homo sapiens has hardly mastered the art. In the UK alone about 3,000 people die every year in traffic accidents. And while driving feels easier the more you do it, the level of risk doesn't change much. The cocky mobile phone user thinks that because he has never crashed while writing a text message, he won't do in the future. But it isn't skill that has kept him safe - it's luck. </p> <p>Real evidence, as opposed to the subjective idiocy of the average motorist, is what fuels Vanderbilt's study. He has travelled the world looking at people's behaviour while driving and at how policy makers have tried to influence it. Occasionally, Traffic reads like a geeky dissertation on the relative merits of rival highway codes. But most of the time it is a richly extended metaphor for the challenge of organising competing human needs and imperfect human judgment into harmonious coexistence. </p> <p>Vanderbilt does not so much build a thesis as a neat chain of interlinking paradoxes. The first is his observation that car culture is militantly individualistic, but driving is, by necessity, a very social affair. Most people on the road are in private vehicles, projections of personal space where they listen to music, eat, drink and ruminate. Surveys consistently find that, while people hate being stuck in traffic, they also have preferred minimum commuting times. They see a good quarter of an hour spent in the car as 'quality time', 'me time'. </p> <p>Inconveniently, these mobile sitting rooms have to navigate around each other, which also means signalling their intentions. That is hard enough when locked into a chrome carapace, let alone when also moving at speed. It is impossible, for example, to make eye contact at 30mph. The difficulty of communicating with each other on the road, combined with the necessity of trying to if we want to survive, is a recipe for stress. It is the source of most episodes of 'road rage', which Vanderbilt more accurately calls 'traffic tantrums'. </p> <p>In the private realm of a car, we expect to be able to use certain basic social tools, speech, for example. When we find these are of no use, we experience something like the exasperation of the toddler, whose capacity for self-expression has not developed at pace with the complexity of its needs. The problem is compounded by an illusion of anonymity. Sensing that we are somehow invisible in the chassis, we perpetrate impoliteness that would be unthinkable in a face-to-face encounter. Just a hint of exposure is enough to moderate our behaviour. In one study, a car was set up to stall at a green traffic signal and the reactions of the following drivers were observed. Those in open-topped convertibles were much less likely to hoot. </p> <p>Vanderbilt compares this phenomenon to the disinhibition that accompanies anonymity in internet traffic. Blogs and web chatrooms are essentially social spaces, but traditional protocols of civility often break down. Strangers hurl abuse at each other over trivial disagreements. The internet, like the road, is a network where technology generates new, impersonal interactions at such a rate that our pedestrian troglodyte social skills cannot cope. We fall back on primal, selfish instincts. Put another way, the network is a common resource that we aren't good at sharing. On the road, we struggle to put our individual needs - the assumed urgency of our journey - in the context of the collective need - everyone else also has somewhere to go too. </p> <p>That leads to Vanderbilt's second paradox: the slower we all go, the faster we'll all get there. The main cause of traffic fatalities is cars bumping into stationary objects and pedestrians. But the main cause of big traffic jams is cars bumping into each other, which they do because they are moving too fast for drivers to judge the risk involved. Yet making people slow down isn't easy. They ignore speed limits or, rather, they see them as a guide to what drivers less skilful and in less of a hurry should do. Devices intended to control traffic flow often make people behave recklessly. They accelerate wildly away from traffic lights and in between speed bumps. </p> <p>This leads to Vanderbilt's third paradox: to make roads safer, sometimes you have to make them more randomly hazardous. Streets are generally designed to compensate for human stupidity. Cars are guided by thick white lines down lanes wide enough to allow meandering. Helpful signs announce the existence of bends as if the curve in the road wasn't enough to prompt the driver to turn the steering wheel. This approach to road design is meant, in engineering terms, to be 'forgiving' - it assumes people will make mistakes and indulges them. The problem is that, on the road at least, when you forgive people, they take liberties. Our capacity for seeking risk expands to fill the space afforded to it. We drive as fast as the road will let us and then a bit faster. We are more complacent about hazards when we are told in advance they are coming. Give us a nice, safe, straight road and we fall asleep at the wheel. </p> <p>We are safer when we drive as if anything may happen at any moment. Vanderbilt cites approvingly the example of Dutch engineer Hans Monderman, who has pioneered a counterintuitive approach to laying out roads - let people work out the hazards for themselves. That means no signs, no traffic lights, no lanes, no crash barriers and, in the most radical cases, blurring the distinction between road and pavement. Instead of hemming people in and herding them across streets at allocated points, you encourage them to spill out all over the place. You make drivers crawl in a state of hyper-alertness, negotiating their position in constant deference to each other. The idea is that you can design town and village centres so that pedestrian society impinges on the world of the car and not the other way around. </p> <p>It is possible that this could only work in the Netherlands, as the expression of some national quirk. Each society's driving ethos is unique. (Vanderbilt has a data-laden chapter on the correlation between a country's GDP, levels of official corruption and road safety.) But the point of the Dutch experiment is that, unlike standard traffic management, it aims to change the culture rather than the rules of the road. Vanderbilt draws a distinction between 'norms' and 'laws' governing behaviour. Many drivers will merrily ignore the speed limit on an empty road late at night and then patiently wait at a red light, although they can see the junction is clear. Speeding is just as illegal as jumping a light, but it is more normal. </p> <p>In the absence of an outburst of collective will to change our norms, the next best thing is rigorously enforcing laws. Vanderbilt is no libertarian. He reluctantly approves of speed cameras (better some sanction for going too fast than none at all) and he is in favour of congestion charging. People will only rationally evaluate the importance of a journey when they have to pay for it. </p> <p>But Traffic is not a book of policy prescriptions. Perhaps wisely, Vanderbilt does not try to solve the question of how people are supposed to share common space while pursuing their private agendas, which is, after all, a basic challenge of civilisation. That does mean the book lacks a resounding conclusion. Most of our traffic problems seem to come down to the innate weaknesses of our species - inability to judge risk, thrill-seeking; solipsism, greed. We have been stuck in the same jam for centuries. The only difference technology makes is that, in a car, we can go nowhere even faster.</p> <h2>Traffic: A snapshot</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In ancient Rome, Caesar banned chariots during the day to relieve congestion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 2.7 per cent of jams after a crash are caused by people stopping to stare.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The average daily round-trip commute in almost every country in the world is 1.1 hours.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One out of every 10 road traffic accidents in the world occurs in India.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The average American spends 38 hours a year stuck in traffic.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 1720, traffic fatalities from 'furiously driven' carts were the leading cause of death in London.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The number of cars in Beijing is growing by 1,000 a day.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> One in 50 crashes in America is caused by 'vehicle factors' rather than driver behaviour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Traffic deaths quadrupled in East Germany after reunification with West Germany.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Roads in America are underused more than 90 per cent of the time.</p>",
  "<p>Rio Tinto will return fire on BHP Billiton, its hostile suitor, this week when it reports its results, hoping to outshine its fellow mining giant, which announced its figures last week.</p> <p>Analysts predict Rio will increase earnings by about half to $5.3bn for the first half of the year, on the back of the commodities boom.

  "<p>Irate Barclays customers are accusing the bank of discrimination and acting unfairly after being told that their accounts will be shut down because they work for an Iranian company. </p> <p>At least six employees of Bank Saderat, an Iranian-owned bank which has been doing business in London since 1963, have been told by Barclays that their current accounts will be closed with 30 days' notice. They have been told that this is because Bank Saderat is on a US government list of 'specially designated nationals' (SDNs) - individuals and organisations with whom US citizens and permanent residents are prohibited from doing business.</p> <p>The Office of Foreign Assets Control, which compiles the blacklist, has accused Bank Saderat of channelling funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon. However, in its most recent annual report, Bank Saderat said it 'strongly refutes these allegations and has requested the US authorities to produce any evidence they may have to justify their accusations'. To date, the allegations remain unsubstantiated. </p> <p>Even though Britain's Financial Services Authority regulates Bank Saderat in the UK, Barclays insists that it is not prepared to offer banking services 'where there is a sanctioned entity [or SDN] involved', even if the bank has a full licence to operate here. </p> <p>Josephine O'Connell, from Welling in south-east London, has been employed by Bank Saderat for 12 years and has had accounts with Barclays for 27 years. She worked for Barclays for 15 years as an accounts clerk and still has a current account with it, as well as three joint accounts, a deferred employee pension, a private pension, an Isa and two insurance policies. She is also a Barclays shareholder. Although she has been told that her pension, insurance policies and shares will remain unaffected, her other accounts will be closed. </p> <p>'I can't believe they are imposing this on me,' she said. 'I have been with Barclays for nearly 30 years and they know everything about my financial history - more than they would for the average customer because I worked for them. So how can they do this just because of who I work for now? </p> <p>'There's no reason why my personal finances should be affected by what the US government thinks of Iran. We're not at war with Iran, so why should banks in the UK act in this way?'</p> <p>Mrs O'Connell has until the end of this month to arrange for transfers and closures of accounts. She has already opened a new current account with Alliance &amp; Leicester, but is worried that Barclays' 30-day notice period will not allow her enough time to transfer her Isa. 'I'm very worried that they'll simply close my Isa outright before it's been transferred across and that if they close it, I'll lose my tax-free benefits.'</p> <p>She says that closing her Barclays accounts has not only been 'a huge hassle' but also very distressing. 'When Barclays first phoned me, they read out a statement over the phone saying they would no longer offer me banking services; it made me feel like a criminal. I was nearly in tears when I went to the branch to sort out my accounts. It's so unfair - I'm being discriminated against purely because of who I work for. I don't know why Barclays is using these American laws here.'</p> <p>When Cash asked Barclays why it is invoking American anti-terror rulings in order to shut down the bank accounts of UK customers - purely because of the national origin of the company they work for - they declined to comment. But in its correspondence with Mrs O'Connell, Barclays said that it had the right to close customers' accounts provided it gave them 30 days' notice, as outlined in its terms and conditions. Previous reports have suggested that Barclays is anxious to protect its American business interests.</p> <p>Mrs O'Connell has taken her grievance to the Financial Ombudsman, which says it has not yet received any other formal complaints relating to Barclays and Bank Saderat. Ombudsman spokeswoman Emma Parker said: 'Like most other commercial organisations, banks and building societies are under no obligation to continue doing business with someone if they do not consider it appropriate to do so. But they should not decide to close an account for an improper reason - for instance, because of unfair bias or unlawful discrimination.'</p> <p>According to Mrs O'Connell, Bank Saderat is sympathetic to its employees who hold accounts with Barclays, but says there is little it can do: 'At the end of the day, these are our personal accounts. But I'm certainly more loyal to Bank Saderat than I am to Barclays. Barclays doesn't realise that it's affecting so many people.'</p>",
  "<p>A day after announcing that it had 'withdrawn' from Georgia, Russian troops continued to occupy large areas of the country yesterday in defiance of international pressure and in breach of a ceasefire deal signed by Moscow. </p> <p>The country's forces were in control of several key areas outside the original conflict zone - including the Black Sea port of Poti and the western town of Senaki. Additionally, troops had established new 'buffer zones' around the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. </p> <p>The United States, France and Britain have denounced Russia's failure to fully withdraw troops. They say it has blatantly failed to 'comply' with a ceasefire agreement obliging it to pull back to its positions before the conflict started on 7 August. </p> <p>There was compelling evidence yesterday, however, that Russia is planning a long-term occupation of Georgia. The Observer witnessed Russian soldiers digging trenches seven kilometres outside the port of Poti next to the Rioni river and the main highway to Tbilisi. </p> <p>A Russian flag flew above a grassy camp; around 20 soldiers were spread out in trenches and next to an armoured personnel carrier. A crowd of about 1,000 demonstrated in front of them yesterday afternoon, waving Georgian flags and shouting: 'Go home.' </p> <p>'This isn't peacekeeping. This is occupation. Their objective is to blockade Georgia and Georgians,' Fatuna Rubakidze, 29, said. Pointing to the bridge across the river, she said: 'This allows them to stop traffic to Poti. It means they can always blackmail us.' </p> <p>The Russians had taken off their regular army helmets and replaced them with blue peacekeeping ones. Locals flung leaflets at them in Russian with the slogan: 'No to Russian fascism'. The soldiers stood implacably in the afternoon sunshine. Once the crowd left, they took the leaflets away. 'Yesterday they were regular soldiers. Today they are peacekeepers. Whatever they are, we want them to leave our territory,' Fatuna, a police lieutenant, said, clicking a photograph of the soldiers with her mobile phone. </p> <p>The Kremlin's plan now appears clear: to maintain a significant military presence in Georgia, capable of choking the country's economy and shutting down its major trade routes. It also allows Russia the option of a future invasion, should it want one. </p> <p>The deputy head of Russia's general staff, Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, was unrepentant yesterday. He said Russia would continue to patrol Poti - even though it lies outside any so-called 'security zone'. Russia insists that under a previous agreement it can station 2,600 'peacekeeping' troops beyond the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. </p> <p>'Poti is not in the security zone. But that doesn't mean we will sit behind the fence watching as they drive around in Hummers,' Nogovitsyn said, in sardonic reference to the four US Humvees seized by Russia in Poti last week. The vehicles were used in joint US-Georgian military exercises. </p> <p>The general accused Nato of increasing tensions in the Black Sea. American, Spanish German and Polish ships are all heading to the area, with US ships due to deliver humanitarian aid to Georgia today. This 'did not contribute to the settlement of the situation', he said. </p> <p>Georgia yesterday described Russia's occupation as 'absolutely illegal'. Moscow's failure to leave is deeply embarrassing for French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who brokered the ceasefire deal last weekend with Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev. </p> <p>Georgian officials yesterday took The Observer by helicopter across a landscape of shimmering green pasture and mountain to the steamy port of Poti. Their aim was to show off its destruction by Russian soldiers - and to point out that they were still there. </p> <p>Russian bombers destroyed Poti's naval base, killing five people, on the second day of the war. Yesterday, the gun turret of a sunken vessel stuck out above the turquoise water; nearby a white coastguard boat was listing and sunk. Russian soldiers had ransacked the port's main building, blowing open doors and upturning filing cabinets. One had written on a whiteboard: 'Georgian bitches. Die pederast cocks'. </p> <p>'They turned up in 23 BMP armoured vehicles and took whatever was valuable,' said Reza Managadze, a port employee. 'They didn't even leave us anything to eat.' In a smashed-up medical room lay a portrait of Georgia's pro-US president Mikheil Saakashvili. A Russian soldier had stamped on it. He then added one word: 'Dick'. </p> <p>In the town of Gori, normal life slowly resumed after the withdrawal of Russian forces yesterday. Residents began trickling back; a few shops reopened. But the Russians had not gone far, setting up a new checkpoint about 15km north of the city. Russia says that it intends to have 18 checkpoints on the road to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p>",

  "<p>Violent protests against President Evo Morales have shaken Bolivia and cut the Andean nation in half, with rebel provinces blocking government attempts to regain control and tensions running dangerously high between the country's Indian majority and inhabitants of the richer and whiter eastern provinces.</p> <p>Militia groups armed with clubs and shields took to the streets last week to impose a strike which paralysed much of the eastern lowlands and deepened a political crisis. Youths opposed to Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous leader, beat up senior police commanders in front of television cameras, underlining the brazen challenge to central government authority.</p> <p>Five eastern provinces, where the people are paler and richer than in the indigenous western highlands, have vowed to resist the President's attempt to 'refound' Bolivia as a socialist state which champions the long-neglected Indian majority. Protesters have halted beef supplies to the west, blockaded highways and made moves to create a new police force to assert their push for autonomy from the capital, La Paz.</p> <p>Morales, flush with victory in a recall vote which renewed his mandate, has ordered the police to be on alert and hinted he would soon call a referendum on a new constitution to entrench his reforms, a red rag to the opposition. Some of his supporters threatened violent retaliation against what they termed 'oligarchs' and 'fascists'. Peasants blocked roads leading to the city of Sucre to isolate the opposition stronghold.</p> <p>Analysts said that South America's poorest and most turbulent country was edging closer to being a failed state. Security concerns have rendered almost half the country a no-go zone for the President. No one knows whether Bolivia will retreat from the abyss, as it has managed in previous crises.</p> <p>'This division is not new, but it is more radical than before. As well as the east-west division, we have an increasing city-countryside division,' said Carlos Toranzo, a political analyst at the Latin American Institute of Social Research. Radicals on both sides had seized the agenda in the hope of crushing the other, he said. 'This constant violence will not cease. We are hearing confrontational language from the President and the (opposition). It seems they are all pushing for more violence.'</p> <p>The landlocked nation has been turned upside down since Morales, a former coca farmer and llama herder, swept to office in 2006 on the promise of empowering the indigenous majority and reversing 500 years of colonial injustice. A member of the so-called 'pink tide' of left-wing leaders spearheaded by Venezuela's President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Morales has extended state control over the economy, including lucrative natural gas reserves, and thumbed his nose at the United States.</p> <p>His popularity was reaffirmed when he won 67 per cent support in a recall referendum earlier this month, a thunderous endorsement from the impoverished western indigenous highlands, including La Paz and its satellite city, El Alto. The margin of victory emboldened supporters to demand a referendum on a new constitution to cement what they term a 'cultural revolution'.</p> <p>'There are two Bolivias now,' said Damian Caguara, a pro-Morales member of a popular assembly. 'The Bolivia of the traditional, conservative, right- wing governments and the peasant one, the poor one, the indigenous one that has been in a state of submission for years. The latter is the one that is now running the political scene and this is provoking a harsh reaction from the bosses that cannot stand their servants, the Indians, to be ruling. For them, this is simply humiliating.'</p> <p>The eastern lowlands however, which have the richest gas reserves and farmland and a freewheeling capitalist spirit, see Morales as a power-hungry autocrat with ruinous economic policies. They are especially enraged by an attempt to redistribute land and to funnel gas revenues away from the provinces and into a state pension fund for those aged over 60, seen as a populist ruse to weaken the provinces. 'If there is inflation, it is because the elderly poor are now having money to eat chicken,' one man grumbled on television.</p> <p>The recall referendum, which applied to provincial governors as well as the President, bounced two opposition leaders from office, but the governors in Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Tarija, flying an autonomy banner, emerged stronger. A rare meeting to try to bridge the gap between the two sides flopped. The Santa Cruz governor, Rub\u00e9n Costas, called Morales an 'assassin' and gave the green light to ramp up the province's rebellion.</p> <p>Youths waving green and white Santa Cruz flags have added insignias to the shields they use to fight riot police. Many belong to the Uni\u00f3n Juvenil Cruce\u00f1ista, a pseudo-militia. To date, the rebels have not dared seize the gasfields, which would seriously escalate the conflict.</p> <p>But Carlos Pablo Klinsky, an outspoken opposition leader in Santa Cruz, said events could turn bloody if Morales pushed for a referendum on the constitution. 'People here are very angry and it would not surprise me if soon they started seizing state institutions. If the President keeps pushing his reforms, violence will get harsh, very harsh.'</p> <h2>The rich and the poor</h2> <p>Bolivia is South America's poorest country, with 60 per cent of the nine million population living below the poverty line and 38 per cent in extreme poverty.</p> <p>A survey by the Catholic Church found that 50,000 families own almost 90 per cent of the country's productive land. </p> <p>Indigenous Bolivians earn less than half the money of their non-indigenous counterparts and receive 40 per cent less schooling.</p> <p>The four eastern lowland provinces produce 82 per cent of Bolivia's natural gas. Their population is the least indigenous, ranging from 16 per cent in Pando to 38 per cent in Santa Cruz, compared with 66-84 per cent in the other states.</p> <p>The eastern states have a per capita income about 40 per cent higher than the other five states. </p> <p>The reassertion of state control over natural gas resources has brought in an extra $1.5bn of revenue to the treasury.</p>",
  "<p>Britain had 60,000 building societies in 1900, but today there are only 60 and analysts are predicting that the credit crunch will accelerate the 100-year-old trend towards consolidation, leaving just a handful in 10 years' time.</p> <p>As one industry watcher says: 'Mortgage lending has dropped off a cliff since the collapse of Northern Rock. And while the societies are raking in depositors' cash, they must offer generous rates to lure business away from the big banks. That puts pressure on margins.'</p> <p>One way out is to merge with competitors in a bid to cut costs and reap economies of scale. Executives say that informal negotiations are already under way between half a dozen societies looking to tie the knot.</p> <p>Britain's largest building society, Nationwide, has 10 per cent of the UK mortgage market (only HBOS, with 20 per cent, had a bigger slice in 2007) and is widely viewed as a potential acquirer after completing the purchase of the Portman last year. Britannia is also looking at possible purchases, as are Skipton and Yorkshire. </p> <p>Takeover talks are being spurred by the rocketing cost of complying with new regulations imposed by watchdogs in London and Brussels. 'That can be quite a burden, especially for the smaller societies,' says one analyst.</p> <p>Among the societies themselves, however, there is disagreement over how the credit crunch is affecting business. Neil Johnson of the Building Societies Association (BSA) says: 'We are doing well because, unlike our [banking] competitors, we are far less dependent on raising debt on the money markets. If anything, the credit squeeze has reinforced the societies' basic model of taking money from savers and lending it to mortgage borrowers.' Over at Britannia, a spokeswoman agrees that the crunch has shown the strength of the 'way building societies operate'.</p> <p>But this thesis isn't shared by everyone. Tony Ward, chief executive of mortgage adviser Home Funding, says that although the societies are prevented by law from borrowing or securitising more than 50 per cent of the value of their loan books, 'some were exposed by between 20 per cent and 30 per cent' and, increasingly, the societies were using the wholesale money markets to fund expansion. 'Some were no different to the banks in terms of their enthusiasm and excitement,' says Ward.</p> <p>In May, the Financial Services Authority caused a stir in the industry when its chief executive, Hector Sants, suggested that societies' risk management systems needed to be 'more robust'. In a speech to the BSA he said: 'Some building societies failed to appreciate the nature and scale of the market turbulence and react prudently.'</p> <p>But the crunch has meant that the societies find themselves in a Catch-22. On the one hand they must take more savers' money to justify an expansion in borrowing when the credit squeeze begins to lift. But until that happens, their margins will be pinched because the mortgage market is in free-fall. And unlike big banks with big balance sheets, they are less able to withstand the financial pressure of offering loss-leading savings products.</p> <p>David Hill, head of the Stroud and Swindon building society, says that where societies do need to tap the debt markets, they must do so on terms that are significantly more costly than a year ago. And the rush to bolster their capital positions means 'intense competition is driving up savings rates'. He envisages an increase in merger and acquisition activity over the next two years as tie-ups offer a route to cut costs and boost market share. Hill says: 'In the banking sector, we have seen Santander go for Alliance &amp; Leicester, while Bradford &amp; Bingley is not expected to remain independent for long. Societies cannot be far behind.'</p> <p>Mergers are not the only way to boost business in a credit-crunched market. Diversification is also an option. Nationwide last week unveiled plans to launch a savings operation in Ireland, which will help it gain access to funding from the European Central Bank. The move allows it to attract deposits from outside the UK, widening the net at a time when the British savings market is intensely competitive.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Scarborough recently paid \u00a3650m for Portman's Channel Islands-based offshore deposit-taking subsidiary. Others have moved into back-office mortgage administration and insurance. Smaller societies are removing 'local' restrictions on savings accounts in a bid to lure more depositors. The one-branch Penrith has started taking deposits from outside Cumbria for the first time since the 1980s. The BSA says that going national is 'a sensible way for societies to expand their pool of savers'.</p> <p>Although we should expect fewer building societies in the future, it would be premature to write off the sector. For a start, a smaller number of societies doesn't mean they will wield less clout. Today, 60 societies control assets of \u00a3330bn, while back in 1977, 339 societies spoke for just \u00a334bn, illustrating the huge increase in home ownership in Britain over the last 30 years. 'Societies also hold a certain cachet with the British public,' says Hill. 'In large part they are trusted. Owned by their members, rather than shareholders, they represent a softer brand of capitalism.'</p> <p>In contrast, societies that dumped their mutual status in a rush to become banks listed on the stock market look less smart today. Even the mighty Halifax, part of HBOS, was forced last month to go cap-in-hand to its shareholders to shore up its balance sheet, while the demise of Northern Rock is a textbook study of how demutualisation can end in carnage. </p> <p>Most societies have a reputation for staid, even boring, management; but in the era of the credit crunch, such conservatism looks more a blessing than a curse.</p>",
  "<p>In 1975, Paul Beahm, a 17-year-old, high-school dropout from West Los Angeles, whose brother had been murdered over a drug deal and whose stepfather had died unexpectedly three years earlier, devised a plan to make himself immortal. The plan would have the timeframe of his hero David Bowie's apocalyptic anthem 'Five Years'. It went like this: Beahm would form a band with his mates, spend a couple of years making it a cultish, outrageous live act, release one great album and then commit suicide to secure his legend. </p> <p>Beahm proved himself as good as his word. His band, the Germs, with Beahm performing under the name Darby Crash, were, for a while, the most infamous punk band on the West Coast. By 1978, their appearances were occasions of such mayhem that they were routinely broken up by riot police. The Germs' only album, (GI) (Germs Incognito), released in 1979, was widely acclaimed as a brutal masterpiece (an 'aural holocaust,' the LA Times suggested). And, as planned, on 7 December 1980, Darby formed a suicide pact with his then girlfriend, Casey Cola. They lay down together in her mother's back room and injected themselves with the $400-worth of heroin they had bought with the last of their rent money. Crash died, Cola survived.</p> <p>The one thing that did not go according to plan, however, was the timing of Darby Crash's self-mythologising exit. Icons are not supposed to be upstaged, but on the day after Crash killed himself, John Lennon was murdered in Central Park and the world found a more genuine legend to mourn. </p> <p>Crash's designs on immortality were subsequently put on hold, but they have been revived in a film that retells the story of the ultimate live fast, die young life. Twenty-eight years on, Darby Crash may yet take what he always saw as his rightful place as a rock'n'roll martyr somewhere in the junkie's pantheon between Jim Morrison and Sid Vicious.</p> <p>The film, which opened in New York earlier this month, takes its name from one of Crash's characteristic pieces of paranoid lyricism 'What We Do Is Secret'. It has been a rite of passage for writer and director Rodger Grossman, who has spent the best part of 15 years, since he left film school, trying to get it made. It began, he explains on the phone from LA, as a personal quest. </p> <p>'I grew up in west Los Angeles and I used to go to punk shows with my friends to see bands like Black Flag and the Meat Puppets. They were great shows. But the bands we never got to see were the first-generation punk bands. Our greatest regret was never having seen the Germs.' He vowed to put that omission right.</p> <p>Not long before he died, Darby Crash's stage show had been preserved on film in The Decline of Western Civilization, Penelope Spheeris's documentary about LA punk, a more theatrical, decadent relation to its slightly more venerable New York and London cousins. Grossman and his friends had watched that footage over and over. Crash, he suggests, was not only the most extreme but also the most romantic figure of that time and place. He had literally been the poster boy for Spheeris's movie, pictured on the film's promotional fliers passed-out drunk on stage, prefiguring his death mask by a couple of months. 'Darby,' Grossman says, 'was at or very near the heart of a very important scene. He drew people to him. It's an overused term but in the Los Angeles I grew up in he was a living legend.' </p> <p>In his efforts to resurrect that legend, Grossman initially set about trying to interview all the people who had known Darby. He started with Crash's mother, Faith, apparently the root of much of the singer's angst and self-loathing; when she gave her blessing for the film, he went on from there. 'People were still deeply emotional and wounded by what had happened,' he says. 'They still are. I carried that with me through the whole process.'</p> <p>The movie is, necessarily, pitched somewhere between myth and reality. The Germs had been a polarising force and Grossman discovered that everyone he spoke to 'had a different perspective and everything was always heightened when they remembered Darby. People cared a great deal that I got things right'. </p> <p>No one cared more than the surviving members of the Germs, who had been rechristened by Crash: bass player Lorna Doom, guitarist Pat Smear (who went on to play with Nirvana and currently plays with the Foo Fighters) and the crazed drummer Don Bolles. All of them make large claims for Darby Crash, but none more so than Bolles. 'With a little more luck and concentrated effort,' he suggests, 'Darby could have fulfilled his plan to be the new Jesus/Bowie/Manson/Hitler/L Ron Hubbard... he was a natural messiah type, whose heroic consumption of LSD helped make him the most psychedelic prankster I have ever known.'</p> <p>It is hard to get that kind of persuasive anarchy on film and because he pursued his subject from the perspective of a fan, Grossman's movie suffers from the curse of all biopics: it never quite lives up to the mythology of the real thing. Even so, enough of Crash's unhinged charisma survives in the performance of Shane West, last seen playing Dr Ray Barnett in ER, to have allowed the actor to be paid the ultimate compliment by the survivors of the band: West is now touring - as 'Shane Wreck' - with the re-formed Germs as a replacement for Crash.</p> <p>When I speak to Lorna Doom in LA, she is just back from the film's premiere in New York. Watching it was, she explains, her weirdest emotional experience (and she no doubt has plenty to choose from). 'It was like seeing this intense portion of my life rerun up there - lots of happy memories, some bad ones.' </p> <p>She had replayed a lot of that footage over and over in her head in the past and the film has been a way of exorcising it. Now it's out there, she feels she can finally move on from those days. 'I think the movie has pretty much put all those feelings away for me once and for all. It was very cathartic.'</p> <p>Equally therapeutic has been the opportunity to re-form the Germs with Shane West. By the end of its original life, the band had not so much fallen apart as been made redundant - no venue would risk booking them. Three days before he died, Crash had ended their last show, itself a desperate reunion effort, with the words: 'You will not see this again.' The revival (and the film) has in some ways proved him wrong. How does that feel to Lorna Doom, now 50?</p> <p>'It was totally surprising to get the band together again,' she says, 'but it's also the most comfortable thing in the world.' In her view, the new Germs exceed the original in the fact that they can now really play their instruments (when they went on stage the first time in 1977 at the Whisky a Go-Go on Sunset Boulevard, they had never really picked up guitars - Crash had designed the band's T-shirts and put up posters before they had got around to learning any chords). Don Bolles agrees that the second coming of the Germs has an eerie symmetry. 'We are the first band to embrace the actor from the biopic as their singer and then go on to perform together like nothing happened,' he suggests.</p> <p>The audience these days consists of some old faithfuls and a new generation that knows more about the history of the Germs than Lorna Doom does. There is, she says, with some relief, a lot less carnage than there used to be.</p> <p>'It all got terribly violent and extremely frightening towards the end when there was this influx of punks from southern California who latched on to our gigs and basically made it impossible for us to play without a riot happening. That was the beginning of the end.'</p> <p>As Grossman's film makes clear, it hadn't always been like that. To begin with, it was all a laugh. The best scenes from the film are The Commitments-like early days when Crash and Smear put out an ad for 'two untalented girls' and Lorna Doom and her flatmate Belinda Carlisle applied (Carlisle was in the original line-up, as 'Dottie Danger', but soon left to form the Go-Go's). Though Darby had his death wish, part of the reason for starting the band was, as Smears has recalled, more innocent: it lay in the shocking discovery that one of their heroes, Alice Cooper, enjoyed a round of golf. If they formed a band, they were not going to fake it. 'Whatever we were going to be, we were going to be the most. If we're gonna be punk, then we are gonna out-punk the Sex Pistols! If we are gonna be the worst band ever, then we are gonna be the fucking worst band ever!'</p> <p>At first, the anarchy was all contrived; doing a deranged cover of 'Sugar, Sugar', Crash would chuck bags of the stuff at the audience; later, when the drugs got harder and things took a predictably darker turn, the chaos was for real. Crash was happy to borrow any punk cliche he could import from London or New York and give it a personal twist. The Germs became a resident band at the Masque, the hippest of all LA's underground clubs, run by a Scottish expat called Brendan Mullen. With bands like the Screamers and the Weirdos they would try to out-shock each other. Apeing Iggy Pop, Darby Crash took to cutting himself on stage, generally making a bloody sphere on his chest that signified 'Circle One', a cultish idea that he wanted the band and its followers to indulge in (Germs fans identified themselves with a cigarette burn on the inside of their left wrist; the burn had to be created by another fan). </p> <p>Borrowing wildly from Nietzsche and Oswald Spengler, David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, Mussolini and Dianetics, Crash came up with a narcotic kind of lyric that he believed might be a form of mind-control laced with despair and self-parody. A closeted gay and, for a long time, in the proper Warholian tradition, a virgin, he portrayed himself as a 'Sex Boy': 'I like it anywhere any time that I can/ I'm the fucking son of superman' and, toying with fascistic imagery as a second coming: 'I'm Darby Crash/ A social blast/ Chaotic master....'</p> <p>The chaos quickly mastered him, however. One friend, Rik L Rik, recalled how, by 1979, his stage show 'had just become a kind of Evel Knievel spectacle. But the thing was, Darby never made the other side of the canyon'. Shane West captures some of that sense, without ever making it wholly credible, though the end, even though expected, still comes with a sense of shocking waste. Hardly a day went by without Crash telling anyone who would listen of his five-year plan, but he was so full of life that people hardly believed him.</p> <p>As Pat Smear subsequently recalled: 'Darby was very specific about how and when he was going to kill himself. When we were rehearsing for the reunion show he said, \"The only reason I'm doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with.\" He'd said that so many times I just said, \"Oh, right...\" and didn't think about it any more.'</p> <p>Crash's Nancy Spungen was Casey Cola. In a book about his life that Brendan Mullen put together, she remembered that last night with a horrible kind of teenage naivety. 'Both of us were like, \"Are you sure?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes, I'm sure, if you're going to do it.\" It was like putting two kids in a room and they end up maybe doing something they wouldn't do alone... he hit me up first and he said, \"Are you OK?\" and I said, \"Um... yeah.\" I was sitting up and he put his hand at the small of my back and said, \"Just hold it, stay there - just wait for me OK?\" He held me up for a second, then he hit himself up; then he laid himself against the wall and pulled me to him. It was almost like he forgot what he was going to do and then he realised, and he said, \"Wait a minute\", then he kissed me and said, \"Well, bye.\" Everything was cool, both of us were in agreement and we were happy with what we were doing.'</p> <p>Cola's heart stopped for a while in the night, but she woke up with Crash's body in her arms. She was subsequently committed to an asylum. </p> <p>The day she heard the news, Lorna Doom recalls that she was about to board a plane to New York to start a new life. When she landed, she discovered that John Lennon had been shot. 'It made it all worse in a way,' she recalls. 'We just wanted to mourn Darby and all this other stuff was going on.'</p> <p>Some friends from the old days put on a show. David Brown, co-founder of the Screamers, the band that had rivalled the Germs for outrageous headlines in LA, sat at a big white piano and John Morris of Black Randy and the Metro Squad took to the stage wearing a hippie wig, little, wire-framed glasses and a Germs armband with the trademark Circle One on it. He opened, on cue, with the line: 'Imagine there's no Darby.' It was, Brown recalled, 'sort of made up on the spot, but one of the few things we ever did that actually came off'. He resisted the idea, however, that 'Darby Crash was the Queen of the Prom, or whatever. That misses the point of what a great guy he was. I remember him as somebody who was fun to sit up all night and take drugs with; he was actually sort of low-key. I don't really remember this heavy-duty poet and the rest of that crap'.</p> <p>Disciples, however, are always likely to mythologise. Low-key guys quietly taking drugs don't make for tortured biopics. There are plenty of followers, still brandishing their Germs burns, who will line up to say that Rodger Grossman's film is not the way it happened at all. Jenny Lens, a photographer who captured the rise and fall of the Germs in stills, warns 'not to believe one word of the movie'. But Grossman is happy to defer to those who were closest to the story. Lorna Doom tells me that in whatever kind of anarchist's heaven Darby is now watching from, he would be loving it. It is, after all, what he always dreamed of - though once again you have to say the timing could have been a little better. Box office has been slow, so far, the film's producers admit, because the launch of What We Do Is Secret coincided with the launch of the greatest show on earth, the opening ceremony of the Olympics.</p> <h2>The Germs: A history</h2> <p><strong>Early life</strong></p> <p>Darby Crash (born Jan Paul Beahm, aka Bobby Pyn) born 26 September 1958.</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>16 April 1977</strong> The Germs, play their first gig at LA's Orpheum, opening for the Weirdos and the Zeros.

Some bands have stood the test of time regardless - the Ramones and hardcore heroes Minor Threat are two whose recorded works are undiminished by time and taste. </p> <p>Like their LA peers the Circle Jerks and Fear, the Germs were an influential band, but their music wasn't nearly the most resonant thing about them. They were lurid, out of control and funny, as anyone who has seen Penelope Spheeris's landmark film, The Decline of Western Civilization, will attest.</p> <p>The Germs' only album, (GI), in 1979, remains a landmark record for what it meant, not for what it sounded like. Its speed and sense of mission would influence the next generation of hardcore punks and its visuals almost singlehandedly kicked off the revolution in punk graphics away from London's ransom-note template. </p> <p>To the meaning-hungry, secrecy-loving, symbol-embracing punks, the Germs's enigmatic blue circle came to represent both the band's simplicity and complexity. </p> <p>Produced by Joan Jett, (GI) sonically documents the LA scene's relatively late punk flowering, sneering and sniping to a breakneck garage-punk squall. Guitarist Pat Smear (a pun on pap smear, the American term for the gynaecological examination) went on to play in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters and his capable, thuggish riffs anchor the outpourings. Singer Darby Crash - almost certainly gay, conflicted about it, full of scorn, bile and drugs - had a way with words that made his lyrics worth tuning in to (he often sang off-mike). </p> <p>The barely disguised autobiography 'Richie Dagger's Crime' offered up a picture of 'a remnant from an outbreak past/ Wore something in his ear/ And boy was he a sass'. Really, though, the Germs were less a band than a black hole around which sticky chaos could orbit. <br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p>",
  "<p>This is the best August ever in New York. I'm not actually there, but one of my friends is insisting so in her Facebook update and she has a smiley new profile picture to prove it. Stuck here at my desk, I can see that others have been frolicking on French farms, trekking up Californian mountains and exploring Alaskan forests. It's not just Facebook. News of other people's fun-filled summers is flooding in via every mode of communication. It's enough to make you yearn for the plain old picture postcard with its scrawled cheer and exotic stamp.</p> <p>This is, of course, the season for having fun - unless you're working. If, like me, you're busy with research and haven't got an office, you could be forgiven for thinking that you could find sanctuary from such determined merriment in a library. How wrong you would be.</p> <p>Like plenty of people who count themselves supporters of public libraries, it had been a while since I last stepped inside one. I was prepared for the diminished shelves and the computer terminals, for the CDs and DVDs. Used to the British Library's epic rule book, which currently outlaws umbrellas and unopened letters, I was a little surprised to see a man stroll by sipping a latte. On a nearby table, two girls consumed a packet of crumbly chocolate digestives.</p> <p>But the biggest change? Silence. Once as essential to libraries as books themselves, silence is now as elusive as that stolen copy of Lord of the Flies - except it hasn't been pinched, it's been driven out.</p> <p>Libraries, you see, are meant to be fun. In the morning, there are creches that consist not of storytelling but percussion-accompanied singalongs. Foreign language students chat loudly, the Germans picking up Spanish accents and the Italians learning about French kissing while supposedly swotting up English verbs. Mobiles ring and are answered not with a whispered: 'I'm in the library', but a loud: 'Hiiiiii! How are you?' In the advent of a freakish burst of quiet, you'll hear the tinny background rattle of iTunes. The only thing you won't hear is a 'shush'.</p> <p>Let me be clear: my library is clean, light and friendly, housed in an award-winning, glass-fronted cube and constructed to an ecologically sound brief. Unfortunately, it is also open plan. I'm sure the architect's pitch featured plenty of laudable theories about community and the free circulation of ideas, but the notion of an open-plan library is ridiculous, especially if you're going to allow people to talk.</p> <p>A library is a Tardis on your high street. It's a portal to the secrets of the universe, to jaw-dropping facts and mind-expanding fictions. But to be properly receptive to them, you need quiet. Silence is also what gives libraries their charge - what makes them fun, if you will, permitting daydreaming and giving the mind space to race. It even accounts for the mischievous fetishisation of librarians ('Take off those glasses and let down your hair for me,' croon indie rockers My Morning Jacket in one of their latest songs, 'Librarian').</p> <p>Of course, much of what we once hunted down on the shelves is now online, but as information has become more widely available, silence has grown scarcer. In search of a bit, I left and went to the cafe, where Olympic divers were pirouetting on a widescreen television. The volume was turned down but it was a mesmerising example of what's possible with discipline and dedication. Silence is golden and, in a public library, it's not wholly divorced from the kind of commitment that leads to the medal podium. </p> <p>Call me a killjoy, but please - in a whisper.</p>",
  "<p>The good news from Pakistan is that last week Pervez Musharraf, the general who seized power in a military coup in 1999, resigned. Better still, it was civilian political pressure and not an assassin's bullet that terminated his presidency. That, for a country sometimes described as the most dangerous on Earth, looks encouragingly democratic.</p> <p>The bad news is that Mr Musharraf's departure does not make Pakistan much less dangerous. Hostility to the unpopular President was perhaps the only unifying force in a fractious coalition government. With Mr Musharraf gone, the stage is clear for a ruthless power struggle between the Pakistan People's party, vehicle for the family ambitions of the late Benazir Bhutto, and the Pakistan Muslim League of former premier Nawaz Sharif. </p> <p>Since Pakistan is a nuclear power and host, along its lawless border with Afghanistan, to Taliban and al-Qaeda bases, the country's political turmoil is an obvious source of anxiety in the West. Mr Musharraf's rule was undemocratic, but, viewed from Washington, it offered strategic clarity. The general was an ally in the 'War on Terror'. The promise to purge his country of jihadi militants earned Mr Musharraf billions of dollars in aid. </p> <p>But Mr Musharraf failed, not least because he looked like a White House client. Pakistan is not in any sense a 'Western' country. It is a militarily powerful but economically under-developed state, born of anti-colonial struggle and home to the world's second largest Muslim population. Mr Musharraf's apparent subordination of the national interest to serve American policy was always going to provoke a backlash that was part nationalist, part Islamic in character. That backlash made Mr Musharraf's regime more reliant on Washington and more repressive. Not surprisingly, many Pakistanis do not now associate domestic political freedom with US foreign policy.</p> <p>That does not mean that Pakistan is a hot- bed of Taliban-style radicalism. Extremist parties struggle to get even 10 per cent of the national vote. Even without Mr Musharraf, Islamabad hardly needs persuading that jihadi terrorism is a threat. More Pakistanis were murdered by Islamic militants last year than were killed in the 9/11 attacks on the US. </p> <p>But Pakistan struggles to reconcile civilian political determination to keep extremists at bay with military strategic preoccupations that predate the US 'War on Terror'. In particular, the country's military and intelligence establishment has historically seen collaboration with the Taliban as a weapon against India. Those forces are increasingly alarmed by a nascent alliance between Delhi and Nato-sustained Afghanistan. Pakistan felt safer from its oldest enemy when Afghanistan was a primitive buffer zone, controlled by Muslim fanatics. India blames Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency for a recent bomb attack on its Kabul embassy. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the ability of Taliban fighters to seek refuge in Pakistan is a source of constant frustration for Nato commanders in Afghanistan. But even if Pakistan were capable of expelling the Taliban and al-Qaeda from its ungovernable tribal regions (which it currently is not), it would need some incentive greater than kudos and cash from Western capitals before it tried. </p> <p>When Mr Musharraf was in power, Western leaders avoided engaging with the nuances of Pakistan's strategic perspective. His departure makes that task essential. The West, which essentially means Washington, must spend much more diplomatic energy smoothing relations between Islamabad and Delhi. The case must be made to both of South Asia's nuclear-armed Cold Warriors that detente would deliver substantial security and economic benefits across the region.</p> <p>That, of course, is a long-term goal; the West has little control over events in Pakistan in the short term. Recognising that limitation would also be a smart move. Mr Musharraf's image as 'pro-Western' helped turn Pakistanis anti-Musharraf. A sensible new diplomatic strategy would focus not on fashioning Pakistan into a Western client, but on promoting a stable and democratic Pakistan which would ultimately be more likely to see its own interests and those of the West coinciding.</p>",
  "<p>The news that pensioners now outnumber teenagers under 16 should surprise nobody. This statistic has been sailing slowly but surely towards us like a stately Saga cruise ship for decades and we have been unable to change its course. Here they come, stacking the decks, those floating millions of elderly, some active, some angry, some happy, some depressed, some hardly sentient, some wishing they were dead.</p> <p>They are not going to go away. They multiply more rapidly than their fecund grandchildren reproduce. The crowds thicken. I am one of them. I will be 70 on my next birthday. I have been drawing my state pension and riding joyfully around London on my freedom pass for years, though I have yet to test my nationwide free bus pass. I am gripped now by articles about age discrimination as I was once gripped by columns about childbirth. </p> <p>Demography has warned us for years that an expensive pensions problem was looming and that higher state funding was never going to be a popular move. Since Mrs Thatcher cut the link between pensions and earnings in 1980, poorer pensioners have been dropping behind in real terms and now face increasing food poverty and fuel poverty, alleviated by state hand-outs.</p> <p>In 2012, a major and long-debated reform will attempt to rectify this, but that's still a long way off and still like Banquo's ghosts we multiply.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there have been adjustments. Some involve the compulsory retirement age - it is no longer as easy to sack people at 60 or 65 - and convincing arguments have been advanced in favour of the productivity and expertise of the over-sixties. Not only judges and law lords and Senator McCain are at their best in their seventies. (But the over-sixties will soon be over-eighties, looking forward to their 90th and 100th birthday parties - what about them?)</p> <p>Harriet Harman's Equality Bill, introduced in June this year, received wide coverage, but mostly for its curbs on sexism and racism in the workplace; less was written about its attack on automatic discrimination against the elderly by insurance and travel companies. I'm not sure what changes were made here or how they will affect me. The commentators were too young to bother to comment.</p> <p>We live longer than we used to, but not always in better health. Fairly but perhaps ominously, experts are beginning to point out that our prolonged life expectancy does not always mean that we survive to enjoy a fit and independent old age.</p> <p>We may survive major illnesses, indeed several major illnesses, with the help of medication and radiotherapy and surgical intervention, but then find ourselves reduced to a life of bags and drips and pads and scans and wheelchairs and possibly of pain. </p> <p>Do we really want that? Dignity in Dying knows that some of us do not. Care homes are usually depressing and their staff occasionally sadistic and no wonder, when the pay for carers is so poor and the work perceived as undignified. We don't want to end up there, but we know that, statistically, many of us will.</p> <p>Medical ingenuity sometimes seems to exist for its own sake and to create its own doctor's dilemmas. Last week, we learnt that NHS dentists are doing more extractions and providing more dentures and making fewer crowns. The new contract has been largely blamed for this, but it is obvious that the over-eighties are likely to be less suitable for and less keen on lengthy rescue interventions than their juniors. The brilliance of modern dentistry can be its nemesis. I speak feelingly, as the victim of failed implants.</p> <p>The public has no sympathy with dental casualties - look how meanly they laughed at Martin Amis. And I am sorry to report that Charles Lamb, apparently the kindest of men, upset Dorothy Wordsworth by making fun of her false teeth. She had suffered enough, poor woman. We all sail towards that bourn from which no traveller returns - sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything - and we should keep one another company and refrain from ill-placed mockery. </p> <p>The swelling ranks of vocal and articulate elderly have a powerful role to play. David Lodge's recent novel, Deaf Sentence, is not only a gripping narrative, it is also a plea for understanding of his narrator's condition. Being deaf is not funny, although many seem to think it is. His book is a testimony to increasing millions of sufferers and those who read it will surely respond to the deaf with more sensitivity. </p> <p>The growing mass of old people is, of course, a considerable market force and we should be encouraged to help you spend your way out of recession. Some of us still have a fair amount of disposable income, which Saga has been notably successful at exploiting. My husband Michael and I went on a Saga cruise last Christmas, surrounded by sufferers from every known geriatric complaint - it made us feel very nimble as we nipped ahead of the breakfast queue.</p> <p>We discovered that some people take several cruises a year and spend much of their lives afloat - they return from the Canaries, dock at Southampton and take off the next day for the West Indies or the Arctic. A few of our fellow travellers had clearly (and rightly) been evicted by their children and grandchildren for the festivities: 'Give them a cruise for Christmas and get rid of them!'</p> <p>The old are restless. A few years ago, while lecturing to a bright and intelligent over-fifties Elderhostel Group on the QE2, we met the woman who buried her husband at sea and now lives permanently aboard playing bridge, claiming it's cheaper than a care home. She seemed very happy.</p> <p>The Mick Jagger generation won't want to sit around at home watching daytime TV, as a pensions minister recently pointed out. Many of them want to see the world, engage with their neighbours and go to evening classes and learn to dance.</p> <p>We don't like being portrayed officially as dodderers with sticks and bent backs who are a menace on the roads and we object to patronising jokes about silver surfers. We want to choose to grow old gracefully, like the Queen or disgracefully, like John Mortimer and Beryl Cook, or not at all, like Helen Mirren. We don't want to be lumped into a category.</p> <p>I have been haunted by novelist Natalia Ginzburg's chilling aphorism, relayed to her, I think, by her mother: 'An old woman should not cause offence.'</p> <p>And perhaps there is some onus on us, as the elderly, not to inflict the spectacle of our decline too cruelly upon the young. None of us wants to be a memento mori. We must keep up appearances.</p> <p>But having said that, I celebrate Chichester and those quiet seaside towns and West Country villages where the elderly now cluster. There is something calm and reassuring about the slow pace, the charity shops selling old clothes and jigsaws, the little dogs, the pensioners' pub lunches, the coffee shops, the flower shows in the churches, the rituals of the wet English summer holiday.</p> <p>Nobody is in a hurry. Nobody wants to be a celebrity or to spot a celebrity. Life goes on, much as it did in Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford. So may it long continue.</p>",
  "<p>My headmaster once carpeted me for truanting. Golf before grades was our teenage version of guns before butter. He aspired to be Yoda, this pedagogue, but with better word order. 'By absconding from school, you have this afternoon missed Dr Roy's excellent annual lecture on astronomy. I consider that punishment enough. Run along.' Twit. It briefly occurred to me to say that missing double maths the following morning would pain me to the soul, but too briefly and not quickly enough.</p> <p>Leniency somehow always inspires a kind of visceral contempt in us, whether we are the perpetrator in question or merely a saloon bar Jehovah thundering at the latest example of judicial stupidity. The month began with headlines about the Glasgow man whose punishment for murdering his wife was being banned from his local for a year. For which one has to read: the 74-year-old dementia and heart disease sufferer convicted of culpable homicide ...</p> <p>Had Edward Flaherty, who apparently strangled his wife for not handing over booze money, simply been released back into society, there wouldn't have been half the fuss, even if, as his defence counsel pointed out, the death of a human being had been involved. What made the story juicy was the reliable association of crime and booze.</p> <p>It surfaced again last week when Campbell Corrigan, Strathclyde's assistant chief constable, revealed a plan to ban men who have been found guilty of domestic assault from drinking. This at first sip tastes very like the perfectly drawn legal pint: tough on crime, but, more importantly, tough on the causes of crime. Except that just about every expert voice agrees that while alcohol is one of the few readily regulable factors in domestic violence, it is very far indeed from being a root cause and emphasising it in this way probably further camouflages the real factors that lead men to abuse women (and presumably vice versa on occasion, though the report didn't make much effort to be gender-neutral).</p> <p>It is interesting and more than a little hypocritical that now the major political parties are less dependent on the tobacco, brewing and distilling industry for political contributions that booze and fags have become the favourite red herrings in the game of social control. The figures stack up uncomfortably, with nearly 50,000 cases of domestic violence (more than 85 per cent of those reported being male-on-female assaults, admittedly, though reported is a key word in there) and with identifiable spikes at the weekend - where more drinking is done - and during broadcast football matches, particularly when the national side is being cuffed.</p> <p>Focusing on alcohol as a cause of domestic violence doesn't necessarily send out a bad social message - excessive drinking ain't smart, however you cut it - but it crudely quantifies a highly complex and inflected situation by suggesting that the more a man drinks the more dangerous he becomes. It also works the other way. Some violent men are pacified by drink and less likely to commit assaults when significantly intoxicated.</p> <p>If risk assessment is based solely on monitoring visits to the pub, frequency of rounds, number of units consumed and carry-outs bought, then police and social workers are imposing a very partial pattern and missing more important vectors in a steadily rising epidemic. There's also very little comparative element to the recent findings and proposals. Do Greek men, who drink more than Scots, beat their wives and partners as frequently? Belgians? Norwegians?</p> <p>Victorian social work often adduced the 'evils of drink' as a sole and sufficient cause of poverty, violence and disease. It was an easy way to throw a worthily puritanical screen over problems recognised as insuperable without an axis-shift in the distribution of wealth and working and living conditions.</p> <p>We're only just post-Victorian in our treatment of mental health in society. The most enlightened and encouraging thing about the sentencing of Edward Flaherty was that it recognised his intellectual and affective degeneration left him only technically culpable. The picture won't get any brighter, though, until police, magistrates and other concerned parties start to recognise that poor mental health - ranging from mild depression to other more serious and dissociative disorders - lies behind both excessive drinking and domestic violence and significantly loosens the connection between the latter pair.</p> <p>If domestic violence is an epidemic, so is mental illness and on an even more catastrophic scale. Depressed men (and women) drink; disturbed men strike out at those closest to them, because at root they are self-harming and self-destructive. Jailing them, tagging them, putting them on Pubwatch's 10 Most Wanted is only a partial answer to one contributory cause. Being sick isn't a get out of jail free card, but maybe, as my old headmaster/Yoda would have said: 'Mental illness cruel punishment already is.'</p>",
  "<p>For once, it is no exaggeration to say the eyes of the world will be upon him. Up to 1.6 billion people will today watch Boris Johnson wave the Olympic flag at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Games, signalling London's acceptance of the awesome responsibility of staging the spectacle in 2012. As Lord Coe, who led the London bid, put it: 'Let's hope he doesn't drop it.'</p> <p>Quite. For Johnson's performance is more than a matter of sporting pride. He carries the torch now for the new Conservatism. He is the only elected Tory who currently enjoys real executive power, the man who offers - like it or not, and lately he has liked it perhaps less than he did - voters a chance to try the Cameroon brand before they buy it at the next election.</p> <p>Who could blame him if a little of this newfound power went to his head? After little more than 100 days running London, some of them distinctly difficult, could Johnson already be dreaming of stepping to the top of the political podium?</p> <p>Two events shed new light on the scope of Johnson's ambition. The first was a newspaper column Johnson wrote suggesting that sporting triumphs showed it was 'piffle' to suggest that Britain was 'a broken society, in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness'. Given that the politician making that claim was the Conservative leader David Cameron, was that a direct tilt at his boss?</p> <p>Second was the departure of his first deputy mayor, Tim Parker, the millionaire businessman famed for ruthless cost cutting, after Johnson annexed much of his job; according to City Hall insiders, Parker was in fact removed after Johnson was warned that the tycoon was usurping too much of his own authority. The move is the first evidence that the easy-going Johnson has now learnt to be ruthless in protection of his power base.</p> <p>These two events have subtly altered the public perception of Johnson as a genial, bumbling maverick somehow above base politics, although to those who know him best, it was never true in the first place.</p> <p>Certainly, he comes from a fiercely competitive family, albeit the kind in which competition is genteelly disguised. Boris Johnson is the best known of the four children - he featured in the BBC's Who Do You Think Your Are? last week - born to conservationist Stanley Johnson and his painter wife Charlotte, but none is a shrinking violet. His novelist sister Rachel is fast becoming as ubiquitous a party guest in smart London circles, while younger siblings Leo and Jo work as a film producer and journalist respectively. As children, Boris and Leo fought 'tigerishly', according to Rachel.</p> <p>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and educated in Brussels before settling in to the classic high Tory circuit of Eton followed by Oxford. After a brief false start in management consulting, he settled into his natural niche: journalism. The move to Westminster, after more than a decade writing about politics both in Brussels and at home, was in some ways natural and Johnson was elected in 2001 to the safe seat of Henley.</p> <p>One of the few publicly recognisable Tory faces at the time, thanks to his TV appearances, frontbench promotion none the less took three years because of fears that he was a loose cannon, apparently justified when he was forced to resign over an affair with writer Petronella Wyatt.</p> <p>But his great stroke of luck was the election of old Oxford friend David Cameron to the leadership in 2005, leading to his rehabilitation in the more congenial post of shadow higher education spokesman. Despite both being old Etonians, the two did not know each other well at school, but both belonged to the now infamous Bullingdon Club at university; while Cameron has downplayed his membership, the more relaxed Johnson recalled an escapade that ended with crawling through a hedge pursued by police dogs.</p> <p>The Spectator magazine under Johnson's editorship was an early and critical champion of Cameron when conventional Tory wisdom favoured David Davis; this second job was his reward, but he still saw himself in Cameron's debt for it. The scholar in him suited the new brief and he worked hard at it, despite yet another extramarital affair.</p> <p>Even so, Cameron took a huge risk promoting Johnson as the Tory mayoral candidate for London. It would probably never have happened if the high-profile candidate he wanted to stand had come forward; Johnson, who clearly did not want the job, was shoehorned in at the last minute because there was nobody else. So the tables had turned a little; if Johnson could win it, Cameron would now owe him one.</p> <p>Until then, Johnson's political career had been distinguished more by death wish - the gaffes and affairs which apparently ruled him out of high office - than vaulting ambition. But once out campaigning, something seemed to click: he realised that he was actually enjoying it and that he desperately did not want to lose.</p> <p>And despite the chaos of his first few weeks in City Hall, including the forced resignation of another deputy mayor, Ray Lewis, over allegations about his past, Johnson has continued to enjoy it. So much, some colleagues suggest, that he has begun wondering: what next?</p> <p>'Some people develop ambition only when they realise that nothing seems to be getting in their way,' says one senior Tory who knows Johnson well. 'Despite all the evidence that he couldn't run a whelk stall, Boris is now in charge of the best city in the world. He's the only serious executive power in the party, he's enormously popular, he's now strutting around the world stage in Beijing. What's not to do?'</p> <p>Hence, while the mayor and Parker remain on friendly terms, a senior City Hall insider says there is no doubt Johnson squeezed him out to protect his own position.</p> <p>When hired by his friend Francis Maude, the shadow minister managing the transition into power in London, Parker had apparently been led to believe that he would have effective day-to-day control. The mayor was told to expect someone to do the dirty work of cutting costs, allowing the mayor - a man who likes to be liked - to avoid painful confrontation.</p> <p>While an overworked Johnson did not initially notice the empire Parker was building, the rival deputies, particularly the experienced Tory councillor Sir Simon Milton, did.</p> <p>'I think one or two of them will have said, \"Who does he think he is? He seems to think he's the mayor,\"' said a senior City Hall insider. 'That will have given Boris a very, very clear signal.'</p> <p>Parker's departure, then, removed a threat to Johnson while solving a problem for the increasingly frustrated Parker. As it suited both men, it was relatively amicable, but it is the first evidence of a steelier side of Johnson. 'This has been a necessary rite of passage,' the City Hall insider added.</p> <p>But against this background, the newspaper column he published the same day Parker resigned, suggesting the Olympics disproved the myth of a broken society, suddenly resonated.</p> <p>For now, the leadership regards it as more thoughtless accident than malice aforethought. 'People are trying to make more of it than there really was,' says a source close to Cameron. The two are not exactly close, but Cameron remains broadly happy so long as Johnson does well.</p> <p>Yet there was private concern that Johnson's insistence on continuing his journalism would lead to embarrassment and he will come under pressure to stop. It did not help that in an interview published in the latest Total Politics magazine, Johnson failed entirely to quell the rumours, saying only that he 'cannot foresee the circumstances' in which he would run for leader, a formula he did not improve upon yesterday, asked the leadership question again in Beijing.</p> <p>But what may ultimately be more telling is another detail from the China trip. In keeping with his mayoral theme of cutting waste, Johnson's team revealed he was changing what he regarded as overly lavish travel plans for Beijing inherited from Ken Livingstone. The new mayor would switch to a cheaper hotel and fly economy.</p> <p>The hair shirt image was spoilt, however, when it was reported that Johnson's aides unsuccessfully tried to get the mayor an upgrade. Johnson, apparently, was no keener than Livingstone on flying cattle class; he just didn't plan to pay for a better seat. While ambition in a politician is usually forgiven by voters, hypocrisy is not.</p> <p>Boris Johnson can still refine this rather risky act; as one colleague notes, he is 'a good classical scholar and he knows what follows hubris'. London's mayor has every right, representing British athletes, to glow with pride. But he had better hope it does not precede a fall.</p> <h2>The Johnson lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, 19 June 1964, in New York, the eldest of four children, to Stanley Johnson, former Conservative MEP, and artist Charlotte Johnson.</p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Eton; Balliol College, Oxford.

  "<p>Sir Craig Reedie can still remember how flat he felt after Britain's beleaguered Olympic squad fled Atlanta having won only one gold medal, finished 36th in the medals table behind Ireland and were being lampooned as the worst team to leave these shores in the 100-year history of the Games.</p> <p>It was a feeling of sheer hopelessness for the chairman of the British Olympic Association and he wondered what could be done to change things. The answer came from an unlikely source. </p> <p>It was the Prime Minister at the time John Major who changed the law so that National Lottery money could be used to give personal funding to athletes that has so transformed the landscape for British sport. 'I don't think [from] those numbers of years ago, I would ever have predicted that we would have finished fourth in the Olympic medals table,' Sir Craig admits. </p> <p>'In addition to building facilities we also began to help athletes and governing bodies. That began to work through to Sydney [28 medals, 11 of which were gold] and Athens [30, nine] which was good news. The winning of the [2012] Games in 2005 resulted in the most enormous increase of funding to governing bodies. Our governing bodies are the envy of the world.'</p> <p>There is no better example of this than cycling, Britain's most successful sport in Beijing with 14 medals, eight of them gold. Since the Athens Olympics four years ago they have received \u00a322.1m from the overall fund of \u00a3235m and run the most technologically advanced programme in the world. For Atlanta, in pre-Lottery days, they received a grant of \u00a322,750 to prepare.</p> <p>'Any sport in Britain that wants to learn the mechanics of it [success] should go to Manchester and speak to [performance director] David Brailsford. They are the best in the world.' </p> <p>Brailsford has refined a system he inherited from Peter Keen, a sports scientist who had taken over the British Cycling Federation when they were facing bankruptcy because of an unpaid gas and electricity bill of \u00a3130,000. Keen professionalised the organisation and put the athletes at the centre of the sport. 'I wanted to create a professional team, membership of which would be the aspiration of every ambitious athlete and coach in the country,' Keen says. </p> <p>Keen is now the head of performance at UK Sport and is trying to persuade other governing bodies to adopt the model he pioneered. </p> <p>'Whilst in some ways there are some differences in the way the sports run their respective performance programmes,' says John Steele, the chief executive of UK Sport, 'the basic equation remains the same: sustained investment plus world-class athletes plus world-class support equals medals.' </p> <p>UK Sport distribute the Lottery money and Steele adds: 'You can't remove any element of the equation and hope to succeed. It takes around six to eight years to develop Olympic athletes that can challenge for medals at the Games. Barring the odd exception, there are no shortcuts to this process. So, ultimately it is no coincidence that we are seeing some breakthrough performances in Beijing - even if the scale of it has taken everyone by surprise.' </p> <p>Steele, a former England rugby union international, has warned that British sport must build on the success in Beijing going into London 2012 and not allow what happened after England's World Cup victory in 2003 and the Ashes win in 2005 to recur. Then a mood of euphoria swept the country only to be followed quickly by a sense of anti-climax as they failed to build on those opportunities.</p> <p>Britain's 24 Olympic sports (football and tennis do not receive funding) are due to share \u00a3600m for the build-up to London 2012, but Steele has warned that they will not be receiving blank cheques. A combined figure of \u00a332.2m was spent for Beijing on archery, badminton, diving, fencing, judo and shooting, which failed to deliver a medal between them when they were expected to win at least five. </p> <p>'As with any Games there have also been occasions where things have not gone quite to plan and where the lessons will need to be washed up when everyone returns from Beijing,' Steele says. 'But in such situations it can be easy to overlook that in many cases just getting to the Games themselves is a major achievement in itself - often just making it to the Games means that you are already inside the world's top 16.</p> <p>'While we should celebrate that, we must also look at ways in which we can convert that achievement into more medals. At UK Sport our job will be to look beyond each victory and loss, to learn what we can learn from the Games to help us move towards London 2012 and a home Games full of expectancy.'</p>",
  "<p>Boxing is a sport of courage. In the lit ring of the Workers' Gymnasium over the past two weeks, British boxers have displayed plenty of it. However, outside it, in dark corridors, in phone calls from Britain, in anonymous briefings against the head coach Terry Edwards and his squad, there has been a marked lack of equivalent bravery from certain individuals. </p> <p>Nobody, it seems, apart from Edwards and the boxers, wants to go on the record here. I have spoken to others who demand anonymity and what one insider tells me is as disturbing as some of the allegations that have been flying around Beijing all week.</p> <p>'Some people wanted Terry to fail and do not want the boxers to do well,' I was told. 'It's pure jealousy. Sometimes he doesn't help himself because he's not the best politician. He doesn't mention [give credit to] club coaches. [Edwards' critics' arguments are] these kids don't come to him out of thin air. Also, [to take] eight boxers and only four people to go with them to an Olympics is ridiculous. They say Terry has lost control of a group of wild young men.</p> <p>'Terry should have talked to Keith Walters, the chairman of the ABA, about this. Some people wanted Terry to fail so they could bring in a new regime of senior guys. They wanted them to fail at the world championships - where they did brilliantly; no one more so than Frankie Gavin, who won our first-ever gold medal. When he had to leave Beijing because he couldn't make the weight, not everyone was unhappy about it. </p> <p>'The ABA really have to sort this out. But I tell you something, Terry is an old trade union man from the print. He knows how to fight his corner. He's done it before and he will do it again.' </p> <p>So, if we accept this version, the angry men with no names, those gunning for Edwards, wanted British boxers to lose at the Olympics all along. They wanted to discredit the coach, his staff and their methods at the expense of team morale, massive funding by UK Sport and Britain's opportunity to improve in London 2012. </p> <p>It is heady, dramatic stuff. Only observers with even a fleeting experience of the amateur game would give accusations of such petty jealousies any credence. I do. The past few days in Beijing have been dispiriting, unnecessary and, in a strange way, inevitable.</p> <p>Regardless of the validity of the dissenters' views - and similar criticism stretches back to the days of Kevin Hickey as the national team coach in the Eighties - so blind to the greater cause were they that they felt no guilt about letting the dirt fly at a time that suited them and not the team.</p> <p>The silent conspirators handed what they had to the Daily Mail, a newspaper where they were confident of a sympathetic hearing. One of the paper's columnists called for the squad to be brought home - two days before James DeGale, David Price and Tony Jeffries reached the semi-finals. This was followed by the knockout blow. </p> <p>Even as the last three of Britain's seven boxers were securing their guaranteed bronze medals by reaching that stage, their achievements were overshadowed by allegations that Billy Joe Saunders, the smiling Gypsy poster boy of the team, had behaved in an 'obscene and lewd' way to a woman in a hotel. </p> <p>There was video evidence. Those who had seen the clip said it was 'sick', 'outrageous', that Saunders had been 'absolutely disgusting to the woman' and he had behaved in a 'sexually explicit and abusive manner'. What's more, the squad had been 'tainted by disgrace in the ranks'. This was, a source told the Mail, 'the latest indication that something is seriously wrong with the way things are being run'. </p> <p>There followed a catalogue of misdemeanours, not all of them linked to the national squad. It wasn't quite the whole story, though. The clip, which had gone up on YouTube and an amateur fight forum called Warrior Boxing, had come down. Also missing from the story was any indication that the alleged incident happened two months ago. So the video could be neither examined nor challenged. Edwards's protestation on Friday that his enemies had timed their attack for maximum effect seemed valid. </p> <p>My source doubted the video even existed. A report in the Daily Telegraph on Friday said it did, but it did not appear to be the one the Daily Mail had been told about. Saunders, it said, had been guilty of no more than 'boyish banter'. Another report claims the boxer tried to get the woman to say the word 'knob'. </p> <p>The one thing that has become clear is this: the boxers, to a man, have supported Edwards. The unseemly public squabble is turning into a fight between the fighters and the schemers. The one critic to break cover briefly - in the Mail - has been Paul King, the ABA's chief executive. 'We have had a complaint by a member of the public about something on a website involving a boxer and we have a duty to follow that up,' he told the paper. </p> <p>Asked if he had spoken to King recently, Edwards said on Friday he had seen him about the village, but not at the boxing venue. It is believed King returned to Britain three days ago, which meant he was unable to celebrate a medal haul last achieved by a British boxing squad at Munich in 1972, when Alan Minter, Ralph Evans and George Turpin won bronze. Neither was he there yesterday for DeGale's gold medal victory, the first since Audley Harrison's eight years ago. </p> <p>Whatever the plotters in suits imagined they had achieved with their Chinese whispers has disintegrated in the space of a few days. The Grand Plot, hatched over several months, has been exposed not as a crusade, but as a vendetta. Nevertheless, if it results in a stable-clearing investigation by UK Sport of the ABA's concerns and of the ABA itself, British amateur boxing might yet get back on track to fulfil the potential it has not been blessed with since the great Dick McTaggart and Terry Spinks won gold in Melbourne in 1956.</p> <p>When the boxing squad get home, the exchange of pleasantries between all parties will be an open and robust one, in the fine tradition of amateur boxing. Saunders, meanwhile, is suspended, his brilliant career in limbo. He hasn't read the letter of suspension from the ABA that was waiting for him when he got home to the family's campsite outside Welwyn last week. Reading is not Billy Joe's strong point. All the kid wants to do is fight.</p>",
  "<p>London takes possession of the Olympic flag today, hoping that a newfound belief in British sport and an old-style rock legend can help it to live up to the awe-inspiring spectacle of the Beijing Games.</p> <p>Members of the nation's most successful team in a hundred years will join Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page for the closing handover ceremony in the Bird's Nest Stadium tonight, where London will try to make up in warmth and humour what it cannot match in scale and ambition.</p> <p>Thanks to the performances in the velodrome, in the pool, the sea and on the track, the mood is already one of celebration. It went all the way to the top yesterday when the Queen offered her congratulations to the British team. 'Like so many people around the world, I have followed their endeavours with great interest and admiration,' she said. 'To all the participants, and to everyone who has supported them so well, I send my warmest congratulations. As a nation we now look forward to holding the Olympic Games in London in 2012. The golden triumphs of the present British team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the London Games a shining example of Olympic success.'</p> <p>Gordon Brown added his own tribute and triggered potential pub debates by calling for a combined UK football team to compete in 2012. Britain has not entered a football side in the Olympics since 1960, partly because of fears it could jeopardise the separate England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland national sides. But the Prime Minister told Sky News: 'I hope there will be a team by 2012. It will be Team UK. I think when people are looking at the Olympics in 2012 - Britain, home of football, where football was invented, which we gave to the world - I think people would be very surprised if there is an Olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it.'</p> <p>In the meantime there was individual glory for Britain yesterday when boxer James DeGale won the men's middleweight title. The 22-year-old Londoner survived a frantic late assault by Cuban Emilio Correa to claim the gold medal at the Workers' Stadium. DeGale sank to his knees at the final bell then showboated with the Union Jack draped around his shoulders, relishing the boos of the Chinese crowd who had backed the Cuban to win. It took the British tally of gold medals to 19.</p> <p>Britain nevertheless slipped behind Russia to fourth in the medal table. That this is now almost a disappointment shows how far expectations have surged after the week of success that induced shock, disbelief and giddy delight in a nation that has grown morbidly used to sporting failure.</p> <p>Ahead of these Games, Olympic planners targeted eighth place. Many commentators thought they were being wildly over-optimistic. But going into the final day, Britain is behind only the world's biggest population, China, the planet's most powerful economy, the US, and Russia, a sporting giant for much of the past 50 years.</p> <p>With the best gold medal haul in a century, the count continued to tick upwards yesterday when Sarah Stevenson won bronze in the +67 taekwondo after a day of drama. She had earlier successfully over-turned the 'blatant robbery' of her quarter-final defeat to world number one Zhong Chen. The flustered 25-year-old then lost her semi-final but bounced back strongly to defeat Egyptian Nowa Abd Rabo 5-1 in the bronze medal match. Stevenson, nursing a twisted ankle, became Britain's first ever Olympic taekwondo medalist. Kayaker Tim Brabants took bronze in the final of the 500m men's K1 race, missing out on his second gold in two days by just four-tenths of a second in a close finish between the top three.</p> <p>But the real story of this Games is the rise of China. From the 2,000 synchronised drummers in the mind-boggling opening ceremony to what will effectively be its enthronement as the new King of the Olympics at the close tomorrow, the host has exuded power at every turn.</p> <p>For the first time, China will top the medal table, probably with more than 50 golds. Its domination of target sports has been total: topping the podium 11 times in gymnastics, eight in weightlifting, five in shooting. Yesterday, China wrapped up all four table-tennis golds.</p> <p>The US has lagged far behind, falling into second place in terms of golds for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. At a time when China's economy is surging, while America is stuck in its worst slump in decades, the Olympic table is seen by many as a harbinger of a shift in the balance of power.</p> <p>That American athletes picked up more medals overall will be some consolation on the other side of the Pacific, but the rest of the world will take note that the superpower has been eclipsed by China as a nation of winners. How this was achieved is likely to come under intense scrutiny. For those seeking Cold War-style comparisons, swimmer Michael Phelps - who broke Mark Spitz's 36-year-old record with eight golds in one Games - was a triumph of US individualism, while the Chinese team remains a product of a Soviet-inspired system of 3,000 state sports schools that recruit and drill children from as young as six, and often in sports that they had never previously heard of. The 110m hurdler, Liu Xiang, was the best counter to such claims, but he bowed out with injury before crossing a single hurdle in the biggest disappointment of the Games for the home audience.</p> <p>Beijing has been a superb Games with 38 world record performances so far, including seven by Phelps and three by the world's fastest man, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. But it was always going to be about more than sport, with the world's leaders in attendance to witness China's return to the world centre stage. Despite the disastrous torch relay, the communist government will consider these two weeks a propaganda coup worth every penny of \u00a322bn.</p> <p>The sight of George Bush goofing around at the basketball arena will have been an added bonus, outweighing the lame-duck President's constant calls in Beijing for more freedom of religion and speech. Most of the criticism directed at China ahead of the Games focused on the environment and human rights concerns. After a hazy start, the first was assuaged by a combination of wind, rain and impressive efforts to reduce pollution by restricting traffic, closing factories and improving public transport. </p> <p>The latter worry was brushed under the carpet more ruthlessly. Several critics of the government and the Olympics, such as Hu Jia and Liu Jie, were sent to prison or re-education through labour camps ahead of the Games. Others were closely watched by police or warned not to speak to foreign journalists. Petitioners were driven out of the city, along with countless migrant workers. </p> <p>The social cleansing campaign included many Tibetans and Uighurs - both minority groups from restive regions of China - who were heavily restricted. The government's hope to use the Games to present an image of ethnic harmony was undercut by the worst upsurge of violence in Xinjiang in more than a decade, and revelations that the happy, smiling 'minority children' at the opening ceremony were actually all from the Han majority.</p> <p>As well as changing China, the organisers hoped the Olympics would change perceptions of the country in the outside world. This Games will have impressed them with the scale and speed of change in China, with its modernity, with the improved living standards of its people.

  "<p>Over the years there has been no shortage of promoted teams breathing new life into the Premier League before being worn down and swallowed up by the demands of life among the elite. Will Hull experience the same fate after surprising everyone by opening in productive fashion? Or have we all been wrong about their chances of staying the course and surviving?</p> <p>Whatever happens, Hull have done enough to suggest that the ride will be an interesting one. They followed up victory over Fulham with a point against what manager Phil Brown rates one of the best attacking sides in the division, and were good value for it. Blackburn had plenty of possession, but were never allowed to impose themselves fully.</p> <p>Paul Ince received a big reception as he walked out for his first Premier League game at Ewood Park as Blackburn manager. It was also a red-letter day for the top-flight's youngest-ever referee, Stuart Attwell, the 25-year-old from Nuneaton fast-tracked through the system and promoted after a single season officiating in the Football League. </p> <p>Roque Santa Cruz and Richard Garcia were others with a particular spring in their step. The Paraguay striker ended speculation about his future on Friday by signing a new four-year contract with Blackburn. Hull midfielder Garcia came fresh from his debut for Australia in a midweek friendly against South Africa at Loftus Road, which ended 2-2. </p> <p>David Dunn was influential in Blackburn's attempts to establish control and Morten Gamst Pedersen swerved an effort close to the angle of crossbar and post with a half-volley. But Hull defended with some authority and were always looking for a quick counter. Had Marlon King done justice to Dean Marney's pass into space, they could have been ahead. Instead, the cross was a poor one. </p> <p>Hull's first error at the back proved costly. They failed to cut out a long pass from Stephen Reid, giving Jason Roberts time and space to bring the ball down and place it beyond Boaz Myhill. </p> <p>The response was impressive, Craig Fagan hoisting a cross in from the right and Garcia measuring an angled header from well beyond the far post back over Paul Robinson.</p> <p>A strong block by Anthony Gardner prevented a Roberts effort from reaching - and probably threatening - Myhill as Hull continued to show resilience. With Santa Cruz having a lean afternoon, Roberts looked the player most likely to turn things in Blackburn's favour. For his part, Attwell had a satisfactory afternoon: his decisions were instant and his dialogue with the players looked good. </p> <p>Santa Cruz finally showed a hint of the form that brought him 19 league goals last season with a flashing drive that Myhill was grateful to see clear the bar.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Gordon Moulden, Observer reader</strong><br>We lacked creativity, missing David Bentley's craft and guile and his ability to unlock ordinary teams, especially after half-time when David Dunn went off. He had shown most promise in the first half, but got injured; after that I don't think we had a shot. Hull were full of running and endeavour, and fair play to them for playing 4-4-2. I was anticipating 4-5-1 and they covered every inch of the pitch. Emerton and Pedersen as wide players didn't work \u2013 they were hitting the first defender every time and Roque Santa Cruz had no service. Roberts was deservedly our man of the match. </p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Robinson 7; Ooijer 5, Samba 6, Nelsen 6, Warnock 6; Reid 6, Dunn 7 (Emerton 5), Mokoena 6 (Tugay 5), Pedersen 6; Santa Cruz 4, Roberts 7 (McCarthy n/a)</p> <p><strong>Rick Skelton, <a href=\"http://www.HullCityOnline.com\">HullCityOnline.com</a></strong><br>A decent game, I thought. We were well worth a point, even if we probably gave them too much of the ball in the second half, yet they didn't put too much pressure on us and I don't think our keeper made a save after the break. We went to Ewood Park setting out not to lose the game, but we did get some numbers forward \u2013 we broke up their play well and were prepared to bomb forward at times, such as when our full-back Sam Ricketts surged into the penalty area in stoppage time. It was a great day, though, albeit in a soulless stadium, with at least 5,000 City fans. And we're still the only unbeaten team in Premier League history.

  "<p>Holiday-makers were forced to dive for cover during a shooting incident at an upmarket Spanish nightclub early yesterday in which three people, two of them understood to be British, were injured.</p> <p>Shots were fired as fighting broke out at the Nikki Beach disco, near Marbella, where guests included the British actress Jennifer Metcalfe from the soap opera Hollyoaks</p> <p>A 42-year-old man received hospital treatment after being shot in both legs, while the extent of the injuries to the second victim remained unclear. A third was believed to have needed treatment for a cut hand.</p> <p>One witness said: 'It was absolute pandemonium. People ran for their lives. Chairs and bottles were flying all over the place. Some people ran for cover as it all kicked off, and others just dropped to the ground and covered their heads as best they could to protect themselves. </p> <p>'The minute they realised someone had been shot there was a mass surge for the door, as people tried to get out of the club as quickly as possible.'</p> <p>It was the second shooting incident in 48 hours in the area. Last Thursday Peter Mitchell, 39, who has connections to the jailed Dublin gangland criminal John Gilligan, survived after being shot outside a bar on a complex in Puerto Banus, near Marbella.

  "<p>Ismatullah stood at the crossroads in the dusty Afghan town of Maidan Shah, squinted in the blinding noon sun and stroked his long, grey beard. 'What the governor said in our meeting was very good,' he said diplomatically. 'He quoted the Koran very correctly. But I am not sure how much power he has. Now I am going home - and the Taliban control my district, not him.'</p> <p>The tribal elder lives only a few miles from Maidan Shah, in a part of Afghanistan which, until a few months ago, was considered under the authority of President Hamid Karzai's central government. Maidan Shah is a typical Afghan town - a scruffy huddle of mechanics' workshops, stalls selling out-of-date Iranian jam, the charred frames of two fuel trucks burnt out in a recent insurgent attack, and a clutch of battered barrows from which destitute farmers in rags sell bruised apples and tiny brown pomegranates. A dozen men lie on the flat floor of the single restaurant amid clouds of flies, sip smeared glasses of tea and stare hard at strangers.</p> <p>Follow the main road back towards the Afghan capital and in 15 minutes you will be at the narrow pass in the ring of craggy, dusty hills around the city known for centuries as 'the Gates of Kabul'. If there is a front line between the insurgents and the government, it is here, just a dozen miles south of the capital. There is no clear front line, of course - which is part of the problem.</p> <p>In the UK, it is the south of Afghanistan, where British troops are fighting, that has received most attention. Yet last week's battle in which 10 French soldiers died took place only an hour's drive from Kabul. It is in places like Maidan Shah, not remote provincial Helmand, that the struggle for Afghanistan will be won or lost. 'The war in the south is basically a tough, bitterly fought stalemate,' admitted one senior Nato officer last week. 'It is around Kabul that the Taliban must now be stopped.'</p> <p>Reporting from these contested zones is difficult. Even on the outskirts of Kabul, Westerners and government officials risk attack or kidnap. However, scores of interviews and two journeys through the embattled areas south of the capital help to establish at least a partial picture of what is happening on the ground.</p> <p>Although news bulletins inside and outside Afghanistan are dominated by bomb blasts or clashes, the real strength of the insurgents lies not in their ability to ambush convoys or plant roadside bombs but in the parallel administration they have managed to establish in huge areas across the south and east of Afghanistan. There they make the law, enforcing a harsh, but sometimes welcome, order while intimidating any dissenters. Their strategy is deliberate and long-term. From this new position of strength, they are building durable networks of support. What has happened in Wardak province shows how they have done it.</p> <p>The only cases that come before Amanullah Ishaqzai, a government judge in Wardak, are those which require an official stamp or disputes among the province's mainly Shia Muslim Hazara ethnic minority, who have historically suffered at the hands of the Sunni Pashtun tribes who make up the bulk of the Taliban. Most of the province's 800,000 inhabitants, mainly peasants, go to the insurgents for rough but often effective justice.</p> <p>'I can't blame them,' Ishaqzai said. 'A court case in the government system takes five years and many bribes. The Taliban will settle it in an afternoon.'</p> <p>Every villager has stories of how the Taliban settle the myriad property disputes which mark Afghan society. In scores of cases, Ishaqzai said, he had convened a traditional tribal council with an Islamic scholar as a judge rather than send cases to higher courts. 'That way at least they get a decision,' he said. The clerics involved are often senior Taliban commanders.</p> <p>It is not just civil cases. According to Mohammed Musa Hotak, an MP from Wardak, the Taliban arrived in a village in the southern district of Jalreez last week, arrested three well-known thieves, tarred their faces and paraded them as 'an example'. The men would probably be hanged, Hotak said. Last year human rights groups in Afghanistan estimated that the Taliban had executed between 70 and 90 people in the villages they control and punished thousands more for criminal acts.</p> <p>Often such acts are popular. According to Hotak, the first act of the Taliban in the villages near his home had been to announce that they would take </p> <p>responsibility for law enforcement. 'They said they were responsible for every chicken,' Hotak said. 'People believe them. When they kill a robber, everyone is happy.'</p> <p>A government minister talked of how in his own village earlier this month a shopowner had complained to the Taliban after being robbed and had got his goods back after the insurgents simply circulated a 'night letter', one of the pamphlets that have been the Afghan insurgents' favoured means of communication for decades, saying that they knew the thief and would hang him publicly. A second shopkeeper who went to the local authorities obtained nothing but a beating when he belatedly asked the insurgents' help. Death threats are common, officials said, sometimes delivered by text message. </p> <p>Ismatullah the elder was clear. 'When the Taliban were in power, you could drive all the way to Kandahar [Afghanistan's second city, 250 miles away] with a bag of money and no one would touch you,' he said. 'Now the government are thieves. Since 2001 nothing has changed, except security is worse.'</p> <p>The road to Kandahar has certainly seen better days. Ruined by the fighting that racked Afghanistan in the 1990s, rebuilt at a cost of \u00a3200m since, it is now pocked with the scars of bomb blasts and many of the new bridges have been destroyed in recent months. Each week government and coalition convoys are attacked - 50 trucks were burnt in one go last month, another dozen last week. Minutes after the governor of Wardak, interviewed in his heavily protected office-cum-residence in Maidan Shah, assured The Observer that the road was safe to travel, a convoy carrying a high-ranking government official was shot up 10 minutes' drive away. </p> <p>The Taliban patrol openly a few hundred metres from the highway. In the more remote districts, villagers said, the local police often conclude deals with the underpaid, demoralised, poorly equipped Afghan National Police. </p> <p>'The police know that, if they stay in their station and do nothing, the Taliban leave them alone and only launch attacks in the next district,' said one elder from the small town of Chak. The Wardak police chief, Abdul Yamil Muzzafaruddin, denied the claim.</p> <p>In some areas they control, the Taliban enforce their strict interpretation of Islamic law, banning music and television. Men who do not wear long beards are roughed up or threatened. Wedding parties find unwelcome guests arriving to check for 'immoral behaviour' and to help themselves to the food. Schools, especially those for girls, are regularly burnt. In other areas, the local commanders are more lenient, restricting themselves to punishing 'criminals' and 'spies'. One commander contacted by The Observer through an intermediary complained of insufficient funds for 'investment' (and ammunition). </p> <p>In one village in the Chak district, locals protested to the Taliban earlier this year that if their school was destroyed their children would never escape the crushing poverty of rural Afghanistan. 'The villagers said, \"We want our children to be engineers and doctors\",' said Roshanak Wardak, an MP and doctor who lives in Sayyatabad on the southern limits of the province. 'The Taliban told them that they had no need of such people, just religious scholars.' </p> <p>However, refugees who have fled from the province to Kabul said that exploitation of local communities by the Taliban was rare. 'They ask the landowners for food, but not us,' said Roz Ali, 42. 'Anyway we have nothing to give.' However, taxes are sometimes levied on farm production - including opium.</p> <p>This parallel government has not come about by chance. It is the result of a careful, four-phase strategy that the Taliban put into practice across much of Afghanistan, first in their southern heartland and later further north. </p> <p>First came consolidation. 'Back in 2002 everyone was scared of the coalition forces and hopeful for change,' said Abdul Hadi, an elder from Chak district. 'The Taliban kept a low profile. Many fled to Pakistan.'</p> <p>By 2005, senior figures began returning to Wardak, reactivating old networks and preaching that a new jihad was necessary to fight the 'Christian invaders'. Exploiting local power struggles, anger at corrupt local authorities and their own authority as educated clerics among an illiterate population, Taliban leaders were able to extend their influence. By the end of last year they moved to the next phase: recruitment. </p> <p>Though fiercely loyal to the government, Roshanak, the MP, needs close contacts with the Taliban to survive. 'I know a lot of them,' she said. 'There are the old Taliban and the clerics, and then there are now the young guys. They are angry, poor, violent teenagers. They are easy to recruit.' </p> <p>In some instances, young men are pressured to join the ranks of the insurgents, sometimes for a single operation. Others are attracted by cash offered by the Taliban high command in Pakistan. The younger men provide the foot soldiers and mid-level command that the leadership needs to develop a real presence on the ground.</p> <p>Overlaid on the network of local Taliban are other groups, too - from neighbouring provinces, the south, even from overseas. These latter are often the most extreme. Some units include Pakistanis, others 'freelance jihadi militants' from the Middle East, some connected to al-Qaeda. Then there are also pure criminals, borrowing the label of Taliban.</p> <p>Intelligence estimates obtained by The Observer conservatively place the strength of the Wardak Taliban at about 800 lightly armed men, split into dozens of different factions. Though significant, such a force should be easy for the 70,000 heavily armed soldiers of the coalition to destroy. But it isn't.</p> <p>From the offices of Halim Fedayi, the new governor of Wardak province, the sound of heavy machine guns can often be heard. Nato troops from Turkey use the hills behind as a firing range. 'Wardak has an undeservedly bad reputation due to media exaggeration,' Fedayi, a former aid worker who took up his post a month ago, said in fluent English. 'I have hundreds of development projects, banking investment, parks and clinics being built. Wardak is a good news story. But resources are scarce and demands are enormous.' </p> <p>Sitting on a metal bed on a small hill a few miles south of the governor's office, Salim Ali, a 20-year-old policeman, forced a slim smile. With three colleagues, for a pound a day, he guards the road passing through the 'gates of Kabul'. 'There's less traffic these days,' he says. 'People are frightened.'</p> <p>Indeed, Salim Ali's vigil may already be redundant. There are signs that the insurgents are penetrating the capital itself. Ten days ago authorities reported a 'rocket strike' on the newly refurbished airport. Only it was not rockets, which have a range of many miles, that were fired at the terminal but rocket-propelled grenades, launched from 200 metres away. General Mohammed Shah Paktiwal, head of Kabul's CID, said 'terrorists' were responsible.</p> <p>The incident may have been a one-off - the suicide bombs that hit Kabul last year are less frequent - but the insecurity in the Afghan capital is palpable. Though few genuinely think the Taliban could once again capture the city as long as foreign troops remain in the city, the cries of 'Allahu Akbar' or 'God is great' from pious locals during a nocturnal lunar eclipse last week prompted a major security alert. The authorities were scared that the Taliban had penetrated Kabul in force.</p> <p>The alarm bells ringing are being heard. The United States has announced a \u00a35m quick-impact reconstruction plan for Wardak. The province is also the target of a new Afghan local governance initiative. Last week Gordon Brown, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed their nations' commitment to Afghanistan. </p> <p>But a series of very senior figures in the international military, aid and diplomatic community in Kabul said they feared that the radical change in strategy now necessary to secure success in Afghanistan was unlikely to happen. 'There are simply too many structural and ideological blockages,' said one. </p> <p>And the fear and the insurgents remain. 'We sent a deputation to the Taliban leadership in Pakistan asking them why they were so focused on Wardak', Hotak, the MP, said. 'We told them that capturing Maidan Shah would just cause them problems. They did not respond.'</p>",
  "<p>The Westminster village has emptied of MPs bar a few workaholics. The assumption is that the voters are all enjoying sun, sangria and sex on the Costa del Sol, so politics can have a month (and a bit) off, before the frenzy of political activity in September at our conferences.</p> <p>The problem with the politicians' theory of August is that it isn't true - most people are still here. The trains are full and London is thronged with people, many of whom actually speak English. There is certainly enough of an audience to keep me busy in the media studios, bombarding the public with punditry on inflation, unemployment, energy prices, the credit crunch and housing. </p> <p>The uncomfortable truth is that the cost of living is rising, as is unemployment, while house prices are falling. These trends haven't stopped because the hacks and politicos are away. I'm an optimist, but having been proved broadly right about the weaknesses and trajectory of the British economy I seem to have established a niche as Dr Doom.</p> <p>Even the economic gloom has had to take second place to Gabby Logan and the Olympics. I have become a couch patriot, cheering on our boys and girls. I confess to being fascinated by the wrong things: the extraordinarily ugly people with enormous beer bellies who lift staggering weights and the tiny tots whose remarkable agility in the gym is matched only by their ability to persuade credulous officials that they are 16. </p> <p>I struggle to understand sailing and the Madison and why a festival of sport that includes BMX biking, clay pigeon shooting and beach volleyball doesn't include serious sports such as rugby and cricket, not to mention snooker and darts. </p> <p>As a politician, my main contribution to the Olympic movement has been as one of the whingeing, carping killjoys who questions why billions of British tax payers' money should be spent bringing this jamboree to London. </p> <p>But I share the feeling of pride that the fraying UK is genuinely united in this celebration. For me, the super heroes were Rebecca, the never-say-die swimmer from Mansfield, and Christine, the shy British Nigerian from Stratford who combined serious training with a linguistics thesis on the etymology of swearwords.</p> <p>After the exertions of the couch and the TV studios, I managed to get a couple of days on my wife Rachel's small farm in the New Forest, a haven of contentment and peace. This is the only place I am ever likely to settle to the task of writing a book on the world economic crisis which I recklessly volunteered before the summer. As an urban and suburban man, I have discovered, late in life, the sounds of bird song and wind in the trees and grass and the simple pleasures of walking in fields and woods among deer, horses and cattle. </p> <p>As I struggle to get my head round collateralised debt obligations, peak oil theory and the real, effective dollar exchange rate, it is an occasional relief to be summoned from my work to admire the bull's testicles and look for signs of his nocturnal activities with a rather unattractive young lady with flies on her nose. Somehow, a new chapter of the book is completed.</p> <p>From there to the nearest thing my Twickenham constituency has to agriculture - allotments - awarding prizes at an open day. There has been a quiet revolution in recent years as jungle has been cleared by dozens of local families wanting to grow their own fruit and vegetables. Although my knowledge of biology can be written on half a side of A4 paper, I seem to have become an expert on nature: I'm passionately for bees and against contaminated manure. My speech in the rain got more rapt attention than it deserved.</p> <p>Other constituency duties included a charity cricket match in support of autistic children. I still harbour fantasies of being the undiscovered heir to Fred Trueman. But my first over was a nightmare: two, head-high full tosses, one ball which dropped behind the bowler's wicket and the other three dispatched to the boundary. Batting was marginally better; a perfectly executed forward defensive stroke, modelled on Geoffrey Boycott, even though the ball had already bounced several times, and various deft glances and cuts scored off gentle dolly drops brought me three runs. Still, a good cause.</p> <p>The weekly advice surgery brought a crop of horror stories which remind me of the pressures which many of my constituents face. One distraught lady is trying to cope with a \u00a3100,000 bill after her crucially ill husband was parked, against her will, in an extremely expensive private hospital after falling ill while abroad. He remains in a coma. The insurance company refuses to pay up. I trust my threats of parliamentary exposure and the Daily Mail will shame them where polite requests have failed.</p> <p>Two young mums in overcrowded rented flats - they want to work but will lose their housing benefit if they do; no chance of a council house; a brood of teenage tearaways in the making. Then there is a tearful, love-struck mother of two whose hubby is in prison awaiting deportation. Yes, he did bad things years ago; now he is a reformed character. Do I believe her?</p> <p>And a long-running case involving the victim of a dodgy solicitor whose name appears often in the press and seems to be untouchable. Why can't I restore my constituents' faith in British justice? After 10 years inParliament I still emerge from these weekly encounters emotionally drained and seething with suppressed rage at the unfairness visited on many lives.</p> <p>The week is rounded off with a clan gathering. One of my Indian sisters-in-law is in town, so Rachel and I head off to meet nieces, nephews, grandchildren and inlaws. The extended family, a legacy of my late wife Olympia, is a truly global affair. Like all big and successful families, it somehow hangs together despite the impediments of distance, deaths and feuds. </p> <p>I think I know and feel what family means though I am not sure that many politicians who pontificate about families do. Do we really need Mr Cameron's tax incentives to make modern families work? I must jot that thought down for the conference speech in Bournemouth; non-political August is coming to a premature end.</p> <h2>The Cable CV</h2> <p><strong>The Life </strong>Born York, May 1943.

Its bulging wheels, super-high suspension, chrome piping, four-pronged bash plate and Dakar rally-inspired styling means you stand out on a suburban road like a cold sore on a newsreader's face. But, heck, what did I care. Donning checked shirt, baseball cap and stained teeth, I kissed my sister, I mean, wife goodbye and hauled myself into the luxurious cab. Two neighbours gawked on the pavement, hugging themselves with delight as they sharpened their witty one-liners: 'Are you secretly from Kentucky, Billy Bob?' and, 'There's room for a moose in the back, pardner.'</p> <p>I took no notice, turned up the country &amp; western and twisted the key. I wasn't expecting a smooth ride. But the L200's 2.5-litre diesel makes porridge look silky. The whole car shook and rattled as we grunted out of the drive towards open country - well, the South Circular anyway. </p> <p>Built for the outdoors, the handling is blunter than John Prescott. Add poor rear vision, an inordinately wide stance and a gearbox which feels like you're arm-wrestling and you have a recipe for disaster. Catching the eyes of oncoming drivers and giving them your best 'excuse me' grimace becomes so exhausting you end up just ignoring them - which I suppose is the point. Parking on the other hand is easy, but that's only because incidentals such as kerbs, pedestrians and wheelie bins barely trouble you...</p> <p>Clearly this pimped up pick-up is not going to appeal to everyone, or indeed anyone. There are two sub-groups, however, who seem to hold the car's testosterone-boosting features in high regard. The first is schoolboys. I drove my 11-year-old son to a cricket match in it and I couldn't have made more friends if I'd been George Bush attending an arms convention. The entire team climbed into the back - where the dead moose should have been - and started jumping up and down. The second group, more worryingly, are adults. More precisely, the 4,376 members of the L200 Owners' Club ('\u00a315 for lifetime membership'). The only entry criteria, plenty of facial hair.</p> <p>The L200 has been around for almost 20 years. To start with it was the 'what it says on the tin' choice for builders, farmers and anyone with a yearning to transport heavy furniture over rugged terrain. But when Mitsubishi added a double cab, a stereo, aircon, cupholders and a slathering of lifestyle attitude, their no-nonsense pick-up was transformed into a chrome-effect city slicker. Or, as the admen would have it, a classy vehicle for rough valleys and smooth valets. </p> <p>Still, with the engine ticking along, the 4WD's traction control making mincemeat of a slippery track and a family's worth of muddy bikes in the back, I began to see the point. Maybe I'd suit a moustache after all...</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>As Russian troops dig in on its borders, the people of South Ossetia are counting the cost of a short, vicious war - and contemplating a new future in a republic 'cleansed' of Georgians.</p> <p>Hints that Moscow could recognise South Ossetia's independence within days have been warmly received by a population that has turned its back on future reconciliation with former neighbours.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ossetian militia have torched and looted a string of five Georgian villages that stretch north of Tskhinvali. Kremlin officials who control media access to South Ossetia have not allowed Western reporters to get out of their vehicles and inspect the villages, whose residents fled to Georgia in the first days of the war. But The Observer counted 270 burnt or destroyed houses by the side of the road in the deserted enclave.</p> <p>Last week a mechanical digger was methodically smashing the remains to the ground. Several new houses had been set alight on three separate days, long after the fighting was over. 'Let them burn,' said one Ossetian soldier at a checkpoint.</p> <p>None of the roughly 20,000 Georgians who previously lived inside South Ossetia in semi-autonomous enclaves are to be allowed to return. 'Should we let them come back and fire on us?', asked South Ossetia's President, Eduard Kokoity, in a newspaper interview. 'So that they shoot us in the back and torment our people again?'</p> <p>The views of Eteri, 55, a former textile factory worker, are typical among ordinary Ossetians. 'The Georgians killed my man and many other peaceful people,' she said. A chunk of shrapnel hit her husband, Aslan, 67, in the back of the head, killing him instantly. Standing in front of her cottage by a sheet-metal fence turned into a sieve by gunfire, she said: 'We don't want them back here, the murderers. They came here and tried to wipe us out. Now, without them, perhaps at last we can live free.'</p> <p>The war in the Caucasus began on 7 August when Georgia responded to sporadic Ossetian shelling of Georgian villages in multi-ethnic South Ossetia by launching a huge air and ground attack to reclaim the breakaway region.</p> <p>Now locals in the capital, Tskhinvali, and the villages surrounding it are furious that international criticism has focused on Russia's tough response. 'It was the Georgians who started it by attacking us,' said Soslan Kochiev, a shopkeeper who fled to Russia with relatives during the fighting. 'It was them that fired thousands of rockets at a peaceful town where children were going to bed.' Large parts of Tskhinvali and smaller settlements seen by The Observer were pulverised by shelling.</p> <p>Kokoity, a former wrestler who likes sharp suits and juggles a luxury Vertu mobile phone from hand to hand as he talks, is banking on a huge injection of funding from Russia to rebuild the republic. At a triumphant victory rally in Tskhinvali last Thursday, he said he had sent a letter to the Kremlin asking it to recognise the republic's independence. 'After all the blood that has been spilled ... we can no longer live in one state with the Georgians,' he said.</p> <p>'With Russia's help we will live on after all this suffering,' said Aelita Dzhioyeva, a lawyer holding a candle in a jar, who had returned home after spending two weeks as a refugee in the Russian republic of North Ossetia.</p> <p>Villagers said that eight people had died in Khetagurovo, including an 80-year-old woman incinerated in her home and buried by neighbours in a shell crater in her garden. 'We won't have the Georgians here in South Ossetia any more, killing and tormenting us,' said Grigory Mamiyev, 24, standing on the bloodied forecourt where his elderly father was decapitated by shrapnel. 'I wish I had gone to burn their houses myself.'</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it was when the prison kitchen flooded and he waded through floating rubbish that Robert Downey Jr hit bottom. The Oscar nominee, who commanded $7m a year in Hollywood, was inmate P50522 earning eight cents an hour scrubbing pizza pans. He was receiving four hours a day of drug counselling where fellow inmates screamed: 'What's wrong with you, Downey? You had everything! And you blew it, man!'</p> <p>F Scott Fitzgerald's dictum that 'there are no second acts in American lives' has been quoted to death, and Downey should bury it for good. Here was a man who fell with the acceleration of Satan: cocaine, jail, driven to the brink. When he told a judge, 'It's like I've got a shotgun in my mouth, my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of gun metal', he seemed trapped in a sordid Hollywood clich\u00e9 about a life and career gone off the rails. Yet, against all odds, he has carved out one of its most compelling narratives about the possibility of redemption.</p> <p>Today Downey is free, at ease and on top of the heap. In Tropic Thunder, he fittingly plays an actor called Lazarus. Ben Stiller's spoof of Vietnam war movies has been described as the summer's funniest comedy, co-starring Stiller and Jack Black with Steve Coogan, Nick Nolte, Tobey Maguire and Tom Cruise. Downey steals the show playing an Australian method actor who, cast as an African-American, dyes his skin black and remains in character even when not filming. 'Blacking up' could have been a joke too far but critics in America seem to agree that Downey has got away with it, and that maybe only he could. He is 'the smartest actor on the block right now, never holding still long enough to warrant a charge of dramatic malice,' noted Anthony Lane in the New Yorker</p> <p>Ben Walters, a British-born writer about film based in New York, agreed: 'Robert Downey Jr is the best thing in the film. It's a funny performance and he's got an exceptional charisma which manages never to come across as arrogance. The black face thing is potentially incendiary in the States, but I haven't heard a peep about what he's done with it.' </p> <p>This year has seen Downey keep up with the fashion for serious actors to add gravitas to comic-book characters. Alongside Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart in X-Men and Christian Bale and Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, there is his well-received turn in Iron Man. Its box-office success guarantees a sequel, in 2010.</p> <p>He has just finished The Soloist, directed by Britain's Joe Wright, in which he plays a Los Angeles Times journalist who befriends a musically gifted homeless schizophrenic (Jamie Foxx). In October, he will be in London to play Sherlock Holmes, in a film directed by Madonna's husband, Guy Ritchie. </p> <p>'He's on fire,' said Jon Favreau, director of Iron Man. 'To have another shot at this, after what he's had and lost, is as redemptive as the movie itself.'</p> <p>Born in New York, he was only six years old and sipping white wine, when his father offered him marijuana as a joke. Robert Downey Sr, a film director, once recalled: 'And I go, \"You ought to try a little of this instead of drinking.\" I passed him a joint. And suddenly I knew I had made a terrible, stupid mistake ... giving a little kid a toke of grass just to be funny.'</p> <p>Downey dropped out of Santa Monica High School to act, landing a gig on Saturday Night Live at 20. He met actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who would go on to star in Sex and the City, and lived with her for five years before his drug addiction destroyed the relationship. One of his earliest roles, in Less Than Zero, was as a debt-ridded cocaine addict. But then he beat Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Billy Crystal to play Charlie Chaplin in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1992 biopic and was nominated for an Oscar.</p> <p>His subsequent films included the controversial Natural Born Killers. Its director, Oliver Stone, recalls a bright and eager talent. 'He was brilliant to work with, outrageous in a constructive way,' he told The Observer. 'He was a young star in waiting. The desire to please and be loved I remember vividly.'</p> <p>Like many in Hollywood, Stone was dismayed by Downey's fall. 'I felt sorry for him because with all these great talents come the defects of talent. Actors especially tend to need outside approval and have a problem of identity. It is now a spectacular comeback because he was really low in the barrel.'</p> <p>In 1996 Downey was put on probation after an arrest for driving in Malibu with heroin, cocaine and a concealed .357 Magnum. While awaiting trial, he made matters worse with the 'Goldilocks' incident when he wandered into a neighbour's house, stripped to his underwear, folded his clothes on to a chair and passed out on an 11-year-old's bed, only to be discovered by an astonished mother who wondered if her son had gone to sleep early. The tape of her 911 call was put on the internet, with Downey's heavy snoring audible in the background. Four days after being arrested, he bolted through a detox centre bathroom window wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a pair of slippers.</p> <p>As he put it, Downey was 'the poster boy for pharmaceutical mismanagement'. He was in and out of rehab and jail. Downey was quoted as saying: 'I'm just sinking deeper into my depression sessions. Sometimes I'm just dead.'</p> <p>Vanity Fair said he seemed to rub along with his cellmates - Figueroa Slim, Timmons, Sugar Bear and Big Al - though there was a flashpoint when he spat toothpaste into the cell's sink - other prisoners wanted his germs to go down the toilet. It was claimed that Downey had been threatened, with one prisoner speculating that 'any day could be his last'. The actor has told how he woke up in a pool of his own blood more than once and said: 'I would never tell you the worst things that have happened to me.'</p> <p>He re-emerged in TV's Ally McBeal, won a Golden Globe and was fired after he fell off the wagon and was arrested for cocaine and methamphetamine possession. He was homeless, nearly bankrupt and virtually unemployable. Those who wanted to work with him found it impossible to insure him.</p> <p>Then, in 2003, he stopped at a Burger King on the Pacific coast, threw all his drugs into the sea and determined to heal himself. Mel Gibson invited him to star in a film he was producing: The Singing Detective, Dennis Potter's adaptation of his classic BBC serial. Gibson overcame the insurance difficulty by vouching for Downey personally.</p> <p>He steadily worked his way back with films such as Good Night, and Good Luck, and Zodiac, in which again he played an addict whose life spirals into drunken oblivion. For Iron Man he submitted himself to his first screen test since Chaplin 15 years earlier. It paid off handsomely and he now looks set finally to join the Hollywood establishment rather than becoming, as he put it, 'this ne'er-do-well embittered, unemployable guy arguing with some hooker outside a Malibu hotel scrambling for a syringe'. </p> <p>He also found stability with film producer Susan Levin, who agreed to marry him in 2005 only on condition that he was finished with drugs. He has said his life is now structured, with martial arts, tennis, Pilates, Eastern philosophy and meditation helping him control his dark side. His strongest drink is black tea.</p> <p>But the past has marked him. He told the New York Times: 'I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics every since.'</p> <p>Maybe Hollywood has been willing to re-embrace Downey because it never really fell out of love with him. There are worse crimes than drug abuse in the capital of showbusiness. Walters said: 'He fucked up, but it was at his own expense. He didn't jump on Oprah's sofa or make a racist slur. </p> <p>'There's a built-in humility with him that comes through in his films; he's cocky, but doesn't have that \"the world owes me a loving\" thing. The whole point of Iron Man is to spend a couple of hours in Robert Downey Jr's company - and everyone's happy doing that.'</p> <h2>Other hollywood bad boys who pulled back from the brink</h2> <p><strong>Dennis Hopper</strong><br>While making Easy Rider in 1969, Hopper would drink half a gallon of rum, two dozen beers and snort at least three grams of cocaine a day. He was violent towards the first two of his five wives. Hopper has been sober since the mid-Eighties, and has been married to Victoria Duffy for 12 years. His best known films include Blue Velvet (1986) and Speed (1994).</p> <p><strong>Rob Lowe</strong><br>Lowe starred in The Outsiders (1983) and St Elmo's Fire (1985). In 1988 a sex tape surfaced that showed him frolicking with two females, one of whom was a minor. Lowe later checked into rehab for alcoholism and sex addiction. His career renaissance came with The West Wing. He has been married to Sheryl Berkoff since 1991.</p> <p><strong>Mickey Rourke</strong><br>Rourke's past includes drunken binges with Mafia friends and a stint as a real-life boxer. In 1994 he was jailed for spousal battery, although the charges were later dropped when Carrie Otis, his wife, refused to testify against him. After years of therapy Rourke has got his life back on track. His performance in Sin City (2005) was well received.</p> <p><strong>Christian Slater</strong><br>The star of True Romance (1993) and Interview With a Vampire (1994) has had many scrapes with the law. In 1994 he carried a gun on to a plane, but escaped a jail term. In 1997 he punched a girlfriend and a police officer, earning three months in prison. The actor now claims to have cleaned up his act .</p> <p><strong>Sean Penn</strong><br>Penn's career has been marred by skirmishes with the press. He fired a rifle at journalists on the day he married Madonna in 1985. A punch thrown at a photographer in 1987 led to 30 days in jail. He married Robin Wright in 1996 and they have two children. Penn remains an established star with films including Mystic River and 21 Grams (both 2003) .</p> <p><strong>Charlie Sheen</strong><br>After a bright start, the star of Platoon (1986) and Young Guns (1988) developed a cocaine habit and ended up in rehab. In 1995 he admitted to paying for prostitutes. An assault on an ex-girlfriend in 1996 nearly saw him thrown in jail. But he is now the highest-paid American TV actor for his role as in Two and a Half Men, which has been running since 2003.</p>",
  "<p>One can only speculate on the fashion footprint of the wardrobes of Lord Howie of Troon and the Earl of Northesk, both members of the Lords science and technology committee, but you'd have to suspect it is minimal. Given each lord's age, gender and peer-group interests - the highest fashion consumption rates are for women in their early thirties who read glossy magazines - the peers' share will come in well below the average of 35kg of textiles per person per year (mostly clothing). Much of this will be thrown out within a year; a small part will be recycled or donated to charity, and the rest will be chucked in the bin.</p> <p>Last week's waste reduction report from the Lords committee read a little in places like an analysis of the woodland defecation procedures of bears. '[The] culture of \"fast fashion\" encourages consumers to dispose of clothes which have only been worn a few times in favour of new, cheap garments which themselves will also go out of fashion and be discarded within a matter of months,' announced the venerable lords in tones of shock and awe. </p> <p>Many women are inured to the obscene excesses of fast fashion. One pound in four is now spent on 'value' fashion as provided by the likes of Primark, Asda and Topshop, which has had huge success with model Kate Moss's range of clothes. Between 2003 and 2007 garment prices fell by an average of 10 per cent and over the past five years the rate of frenzied buying has accelerated, while we make room for it by discarding some two million tons every year.</p> <p>The true weight of this addiction has only really been felt by an unfortunate few such as the Salvation Army which, with around 2,750 of the UK's 9,000 charity clothing banks, has been faced with an ever growing mound of tat to flog to consumers indifferent to pre-worn unless it happens to be vintage. Value fashion retailers will debate forever as to how they can sell clothes so cheaply, usually citing economies of scale, but it has been clear to recyclers for some time that a fall in fibre quality and finishing is part of the equation. This makes the resale of last season's paper thin, slightly shrunken sun dress a distinctly unappetising commercial proposition. Besides, there isn't much incentive for consumers to buy worn when a new dress costs less than a lunchtime panini and coffee.</p> <p>The bulk of discarded fast fashion is chucked into landfill. Meanwhile, the fashion industry has been particularly adept at avoiding green censure and criticism. While more prosaic sectors - food and drink, electronics, detergents and even car manufacturers -</p> <p>have been forced to own up to environmental shortcomings either to pre-empt legislation or conform to new regulations (such as the EU directive that means your hairdryer or washing machine can no longer be flung into landfill) fashion appears to have charmed us all in a haze of sequins, air kisses and the seemingly boundless dynamism of fast fashion with its high street empires and super-rich moguls.</p> <p>But when Defra, the department for the environment, began to analyse the impact of different materials in the nation's landfills a couple of years ago, fast fashion's get-out-of-jail-free card was unexpectedly revoked. The nation's penchant for 'McFashion' - as one-night-only T-shirts and skinny jeans have been dubbed - was found to translate into more than three million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. </p> <p>More significant to millions of fashion-lovers than the opinions of a Lords committee or Defra will be the opinion of the style press. And even those who formerly and gleefully proclaimed Primark the new Prada are now suggesting that fast fashion has rather had its day. Apparently it is all about 'investment dressing' - buying one piece and loving it for a long time - now as fashionistas tighten their tiny little belts. 'Gucci or gas?' asks the September issue of Harper's Bazaar, advising fashion-lovers feeling the credit crunch to survive on 'one big ticket item, something in between or a little bit of both'. </p> <p>There's some validity in this argument, as anything that cuts down the rapid turnover begins to reverse the fact that - according to Matilda Lee from the Ecologist - just 2 per cent of the average clothing budget goes on services that repair or lengthen the lifespan of our garments and accessories.</p> <p>However, to be truly sustainable, the fashion parameters will have to be widened. If fashion is about ingenuity and innovation, this is a good time for the industry to draw on these qualities and return to measuring fashion in terms of something other than quantity. There has already been a shift. Phil Patterson, once textiles manager at Marks and Spencer, has set up <a href=\"http://www.ecotextile.com\">ecotextile.com</a> to allow consumers to assess their wardrobe in terms of environmental damage units (EDUs) with the goal that they'll be more fibre-discerning in future. The London College of Fashion recently launched its Centre for Sustainable Fashion and there has been a renaissance of thrift fashion ideas from reworking existing pieces to sewing classes, kit fashion, clothes swaps and clothes and accessory libraries. </p> <p>There would appear to be some ethical motivation for change too. In the aftermath of the Observer and Panorama expos\u00e9 of child labour used in manufacturing a line for Primark, an ICM research poll, commissioned by Drapers magazine, found that 42 per cent of people who shop at Primark were less likely or a lot less likely to shop at the retailer because of what they had heard. </p> <p>In reality, any demise of super-cheap, super-fast fashion probably comes down to market economics. Labour costs have increased 50 per cent in the past four years across provinces in south-eastern China, the sewing room of the world. Meanwhile, fast fashion is scarily dependent on cheap fibres, namely polyester and cotton - which together account for more than 80 per cent of all fibre production worldwide.</p> <p>Both are dogged by sustainability issues. As petroleum production declines, polyester prices are soaring, while cotton's insatiable need for water (and agrichemicals), coupled with the fact that two-thirds is still rain-grown in areas where rainfall has declined, means there's not enough to go around. Add to this a new, hungry consumer in the form of the Chuppie (the Chinese yuppie) who has developed an appetite for fast fashion herself, meaning that Chinese producers are less eager to export. </p> <p>It will almost certainly get slower. In order to keep up with the trend for two new lines a week, brought to the high street by Spanish fashion giant Zara, competitors are increasingly reliant on air freight, and that is becoming hugely expensive. </p> <p>Shipping a standard container from Shanghai to America's east coast costs $8,000 (\u00a34,315) today, as opposed to just $3,000 a few months ago. Container ships are slowing down to cut fuel costs. If fashion stays fast it will need to become more localised, which will increase cost. So it can be slow and cheap, or fast and expensive. It is the combination of cheap and fast that is unsustainable. </p> <p>In any case, we shouldn't overly mourn the passing of cheap fast fashion. We may be short on cheap fibre and oil, but one thing we have an abundance of is creativity. The demise of fast fashion could be as revolutionary as the mini skirt, the Ugg boot and Agyness Deyn all rolled into one.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lucy Siegle is the Observer's Ethical Living columnist and Visiting Professor at the London College of Fashion</p>",
  "<h2>Why Georgia cannot be allowed to join Nato</h2> <p>How refreshing to read an informed article on the conflict in Georgia which is based on reality and an understanding of recent history ('<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/17/georgia.russia\">Russia has called our bluff over countries we can't defend</a>', Comment, last week). After a visit to Georgia and Abkhazia last year, where I met President Bagapsh and other members of the Abkhaz government, I was convinced that the government and people of Abkhazia would never agree to become part of Georgia again. They readily admitted that their present state of independence is dependent on Russian economic and military support, but expressed a determination (however hopeful) to be independent of both Russia and Georgia. </p> <p>The West can slow and perhaps reverse the complete absorption of Abkhazia into the Russian Federation by recognising its independence and thus opening up economic and political exchange with the wider world, as Neal Ascherson describes. </p> <p>The Georgians, having been brutally but effectively disarmed by the Russians, should give up any plans to reincorporate Abkhazia and South Ossetia into Georgia. I was assured that if Georgia recognised the independence of Abkhazia, the Georgian refugees from Abkhazia could return to their homes. The Georgian economy would prosper without its current heavy burden of military expenditure, whose main purpose has been to recapture the two former provinces that have declared independence. </p> <p>This is the way out of the current dangerous and unnecessary confrontation between the West and a resurgent Russia. Backing Georgia's unrealistic demands for 'territorial integrity' will, paradoxically, drive the breakaway regions further towards complete Russian control and dominance. If Georgia were to be allowed to join Nato, an already unstable situation would be exacerbated.<br><strong>Lord Rea of Eskdale </strong><br>House of Lords <br>London SW1 </p> <p>Surely there can be no more moving testament to the pity of war than the heart-stopping photograph of grieving relatives which illustrated your Georgia Focus last week? A copy of this sent to every world leader would surely give them pause before they surge forward on yet another attempt at domination, be it religious, moral or territorial. I hope to hear that this amazing work of art will be the recipient of a prestigious photography award.<br><strong>Merle Davies</strong> <br>Winchester, Hampshire </p> <h2>Take the drugs industry to task</h2> <p>At last, an official and overdue criticism of the pharmaceutical industry attack on Nice ('Health chief attacks drug giants over huge profits', News, last week). Of course we as patients and families want medicines that extend life, even by a few days. If the prices were reasonable, Nice would have recommended effective medicines and the NHS would have provided them. It is time that industry realises that they cannot hold us hostage to their high-price/high-profit policies. It is industry that needs to change - not Nice.<br><strong>Mohga Kamal-Yanni</strong> <br>Oxford </p> <h2>Oxbridge access is still skewed</h2> <p>It was with a smile of optimism that I read 'Oxford targets the poorest postcodes' (News, last week). While working at a leading independent school, I saw what it means for a school to be able to navigate with vigour the lengthy Oxbridge admissions process. There were talks, mentors, visits from admissions tutors, mock interviews, extra classes and 20 files in the library containing probable interview questions for each subject area. The chance of an Oxbridge degree should not be the preserve of the privileged or an accident of where you are born. As a report from the Sutton Trust found earlier this year, the vast majority of entrants to Oxford and Cambridge come from just 100 schools, most of them private.</p> <p>This is why Oxford's proposal to take into account the context of an applicant's academic achievements must be welcomed. We need to exercise fairness towards those who are as intellectually capable but who may lack the aspirations and preparation to think of Oxbridge as a viable option.<br><strong>Joanne Dwyer </strong> <br>Chelsfield, Kent </p> <h2>Barbs at Bards are misplaced</h2> <p>It is a pity that one of the few pieces of national coverage of the National Eisteddfod of Wales suggested that the Gorsedd of the Bards is in some way racist. Carole Cadwalladr ('Brother Matthew's been made a druid. There's daft', Opinion, last week) is right to say there are 'not a whole lot of black bards'. But she has not qualified this comment by saying that there are 'not a whole lot' of black people in Wales. According to the 2001 census, only just over 2 per cent of the Welsh population described themselves as being a member of a minority ethnic group. </p> <p>That is not to say that people from ethnic minorities do not participate in the Eisteddfod, far from it. But comparatively few speak Welsh. Happily, this is changing. A recent Eisteddfod Welsh learner of the year is black and I was delighted to see people of so many different backgrounds enjoying the Eisteddfod's unique atmosphere this year, something that does far more for integration than cheap and inaccurate barbs at such a fine organisation as the Gorsedd.<br><strong>Robert Webb </strong><br>Cardiff </p> <h2>The camera sometimes lies</h2> <p>The emotive photograph that accompanied Dan McDougall's piece 'Why do the Italians hate us?' (OM, last week) shows, we are told, an apparently 'carefree couple' enjoying 'a leisurely picnic' while 'feet away' the bodies of two drowned Roma girls lie under towels. Anyone with rudimentary knowledge of photography will recognise that the photograph is taken with a telescopic lens, therefore foreshortening the distance between the bodies and the couple. Far from being indifferent and enjoying a 'leisurely picnic', the couple sit there hunched, hands on knees. We do not even know they are Italian citizens.</p> <p>The photographer, Alessandro Garofalo, who works for the Naples newspaper Il Mattino, has openly deplored the fact that of all the photos he took at the beach only this one was chosen by the world's press. His other pictures show two policeman standing guard by the bodies awaiting the authorities to collect them. A small group of beachgoers can be seen standing solemnly and respectfully. Another photograph shows flowers which have been laid between the two girls. Lest we forget, it was Italians who tried to save these girls from the rough sea and it was Italians who helped carry the coffins.<br><strong>Al Pitt</strong> <br>Ancona, Italy </p> <h2>Now who looks foolish?</h2> <p>Having put my Chambers away after completing the Azed crossword (smirk), I had to get it out again to confirm that, contrary to your assertion (Jeremy Paxman profile, last week), the dictionary does indeed include a definition of 'gowk'.

  "<p>The gangland war against Dublin criminal John Gilligan has shifted to Spain's Costa del Sol. Gardai believe that the attempted murder of a former member of Gilligan's drugs gang in Andalusia was linked to threats against the crime boss. Peter Mitchell was shot outside a bar on a complex in Puerto Banus, near Marbella, on Thursday night.</p> <p>Two other people wounded in the shooting were innocent bystanders from Ireland, says the Republic's Department of Foreign Affairs. One of the two other victims was a 73-year-old Irishman.</p> <p>Spanish police were waiting yesterday to interview 39-year-old Mitchell, who is expected to make a full recovery from his injuries. Mitchell, who fled to Spain in 1996, had been one of a number of gangsters targeted in a major state operation against the Gilligan gang.</p> <p>Security sources in the Republic last night linked the murder bid on the Spanish coast to a new campaign by rival Irish criminals against Gilligan and his associates. </p> <p>Earlier this month it was revealed that Gilligan was receiving 24-hour protection inside Portlaoise to safeguard him from other prisoners.</p> <p>Rival criminals are angry over his recent interview in Irish pop magazine Hot Press, via a mobile phone. This contributed to a security crackdown, which has affected the operations of other gang leaders inside. </p> <p>A Gardai source said: 'Up until then, a number of jailed criminals were still able to run their empires from inside. Now they can't communicate with their teams and they blame Gilligan for that.</p> <p>'Gilligan was badly beaten up by a young Dublin criminal in front of other inmates. And these rivals are not just prepared to go after him it seems; they have the team and the firepower to hunt down the remaining members of his old gang, most of whom are now in Spain.'</p> <p>In recent years the Irish underworld, alongside the Russian mafia and British gangsters, have fought for control of the lucrative drugs trade in southern Spain.</p>",
  "<p>Six miles downstream along one of Europe's most important salmon fishing rivers, cigar-smoking angler and fishing guide Patrick 'Pappy' Forde suddenly spots his enemy.</p> <p>Casting his fly out into the estuary of the Moy on Ireland's western seaboard, Forde points towards a band of seals and seal pups gathering to bask in late August sunshine on a sandbank close to where the river flows into the Atlantic.</p> <p>'Look at them bastards,' Forde says as he fishes for salmon and sea trout close to the ocean and to the right of an island owned by the golfing great Nick Faldo, who also fishes the Moy.</p> <p>'If they keep breeding, there will be no more fish left in the Moy,' he adds. Anglers from both Co Mayo and across the world agree and want the Irish government to lift the ban on culling seals, which they claim is leading to the depletion of salmon stocks in the world-famous river.</p> <p>The controversy in western Ireland is about what to do about one protected and now thriving species that threatens to destroy another. </p> <p>Asked if he thinks the ban on culling should be lifted, Forde rocks back in his boat and replies: 'Oh my God, yes! And the sooner the better.'</p> <p>Wading into the Moy, just 10ft from the seals, Forde says: 'I have seen the seals actually take salmon and sea trout from the fishing rods of anglers. They are now so brazen and unafraid of man that they go up to anglers to snatch fish.'</p> <p>Even the statutory agency in charge of fishing in the region has come out in favour of reintroducing culling. Vincent Roche, the CEO of Ireland's North Western Regional Fisheries Board, estimates the seal population in the Moy to be between 140 and 200. </p> <p>'It's a question of getting the species balance correct,' he says. 'When our government banned drift-netting off the coast, the fishermen pointed out that seals were eating as many salmon and other fish as they were taking out of the rivers and ocean with their nets. </p> <p>'They and the anglers point out that the stocks are still being undermined by the seals and I have to say they have a real argument. There is only one solution to this problem, and that is a limited cull.'</p> <p>Ballina anglers say the salmon are also under attack from cormorants. Smolts are being gobbled up along the Moy by growing colonies of what is normally a marine bird, the anglers say.</p> <p>Mark Beattie, a keen angler and member of the local gun club, says there would be a legion of volunteers to cull both. 'Those birds are like the seals down in the estuary, they don't fear us any more. They will swoop down while you are fishing to get the smolts and other fish in the river.' </p> <p>Michael Swartz, angling shop co-owner and former fishery protection officer, says that foreign anglers cannot understand the continuing culling ban.</p> <p>'One German angler who comes here all the time told me that on parts of the Rhine they micro-tagged the smolts. The scientists who examined the innards of the birds found that they had eaten a diet of 93 per cent smolts.' Swartz adds that he is fearful for Ballina's future. 'There are hotels, B&amp;Bs, shops like this, which all rely on fishermen coming here. If the salmon, sea trout and other fish disappear, they are not coming back and that would be a disaster for Ballina.'</p> <p>Those who have fought to preserve the seal population dispute the claims. Biologist Brendan Price, who co-founded the Irish Seal Sanctuary, said: 'Culling seals is not the solution, because almost all the damage done to salmon and other fish stocks has been caused by man.' </p> <p>Back at the Moy estuary, however, such appeals evoke no sympathy. Forde heads to Crocketts pub for a post-fishing pint. As he walks into the bar, 'Pappy' points to an old-fashioned notice in the style of a Wild West 'Wanted Dead or Alive' poster: it offers the locals 'five shillings for a cormorant' and 'one pound for a seal'.</p>",
  "<h2>Rooney transfer deal </h2> <p>It's the transfer of the year. Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen McLoughlin has been poached from Closer, for which she has written a column for three years, by Richard Desmond. McLoughlin will continue her career as a journalist at OK! and rumours from within the Express owner's magazine empire suggest she has been handed a two-year deal worth an eye-watering \u00a31m.

Programme-makers spent around \u00a3200,000 on the show, working title Diana In Her Own Words, but finally canned the project a fortnight ago despite securing the UK rights to footage recorded by her voice coach. The fact that the corporation has wasted a few quid is likely to irritate its critics, but the Royals may well be opening the bubbly. </p> <h2>Hold the front page </h2> <p>Trinity Mirror has called in the accountants, and the lawyers, to investigate claims that a long-serving member of staff at the People has been caught with his hand in the till. The unidentified staffer could have pocketed up to \u00a3500,000, according to Fleet Street sources - enough to warrant the attentions of the company's finance director. That's one scandal you won't be reading about in the People today. </p> <h2>Self control</h2> <p>Newspaper editors take note. Novelist Will Self, pictured, may be looking for work.

  "<p>From beach volleyball to BMX racing, a host of obscure activities have acquired the glamour of being adopted as Olympic sports. Pity then the fate of Australia's sheepshearers, who are still waiting to be taken seriously in their own country after 118 years of competitive shearing. </p> <p>The Australian Sports Commission is to be lobbied for official recognition, a move that would allow shearers to apply for training grants and help attract corporate sponsorship. While some people might wonder if the idea is merely a reaction to Australia's disappointing medal tally in Beijing, Peter Artridge of Sports Shear Australia, one of the industry's governing bodies, is deadly serious.</p> <p>'Shearers should be up there with other Australian sporting champions,' he said. 'Some of these guys train for months to be at their physical best. They're going to the gym and doing yoga and following special diets. They're outstanding athletes.' </p> <p>He says competitive shearing meets all the criteria of a modern-day sport because there are clear winners and losers and participants take part in a physically strenuous activity that requires elements of skill and chance. It is also enjoyable to watch. 'We think shearing has as much right to be called a sport as any Commonwealth or national games event,' he said.</p> <p>The first shearing competition in Australia took place in Euroa, Victoria, in 1890. Heats involving competitors taking fleeces off sheep with electric and hand-held shears in under 60 seconds are still held at sheep stations throughout the Outback, culminating in the national championships. </p> <p>But while champion shearers are treated like heroes in New Zealand, with televised heats and big money prizes, there is a frustratingly low-key approach in Australia. Competitors and judges, who often travel vast distances, have to pay their own expenses and prizes are paltry. </p> <p>Spectators come mostly from farming communities. 'That's because people in Sydney or Melbourne have probably never even seen a sheep being shorn,' says Artridge. 'If people could see the skill that is involved, they'd be interested.'</p> <p>Shannon Warnest, 34, the Usain Bolt of Australian shearing, is a gun shearer, the term given to those at the top of the profession. He has won the Australian championships six times and the Golden Shears world championships twice. Described as having 'the light touch of a pickpocket', he has shorn a sheep in 26 seconds and can tackle 400 a day. 'Yes, its bloody annoying that shearing isn't recognised as a sport in Australia,' he said, speaking by telephone from a shearing shed in Victoria.</p> <p>'Because there are animals involved I don't think it could ever get to \"[Olympic] level\", said Warnest. 'To get recognition in Australia would be good enough for us.'</p>",
  "<p>James 'Chunky' DeGale had no sooner won Olympic gold - against a Cuban, no less - and 'put myself in the history books', as he shouted into the Beijing night, than he started dreaming. Dreaming of doing it all over again in London in 2012. Dreaming of a knighthood. And how they would like that back in Harlesden. </p> <p>But why not? Because the fast-talking, fast-moving southpaw from north-west London did more than take the biggest prize in his sport in the Workers Gymasium here last night. By holding off the awkward, desperate Emilio Correa Bayeaux in the final round to win 16-14, DeGale has, in all probability, saved British amateur boxing from being thrown into chaos. </p> <p>He might also have saved the job of the head coach, Terry Edwards, who has had to endure a clumsy, hurtful whispering campaign by critics back in the UK, rivals who resent his methods, philosophy and success to the point of briefing against him and the team in their finest hour. </p> <p>There will be an inquest into the civil war when they get home. For now, the 22-year-old winner and the 65-year-old trainer he calls Dad wanted to savour the moment. </p> <p>DeGale won ugly. As ugly as he can ever have done in a boxing ring. But he could not care less. Correa was docked two points in the first round for biting DeGale on the chest, although the Cuban dismissed the penalty lamely, saying he merely had his mouth open when it came into contact with the Briton. </p> <p>DeGale boxed beautifully to win the first round 6-1, but thereafter it was a dogfight of the first order. Both boxers lost their rhythm completely, falling to the floor several times. The second round went DeGale's way and he led 10-4. He was docked two points in the third and then the contest descended even further into mayhem. Correa edged the round 6-2, but looked spent. </p> <p>The fourth was such a mess, it could have gone either way. The score remained agonisingly close in DeGale's favour: 12-10, 12-11, 13-11, 14-11, 14-12 (with a minute to go), 15-12, 15-13 (30 seconds), 16-13 and, at the last gasp, at the very end of everyone's nerves, 16-14. </p> <p>'I'm gold medallist - still can't believe it,' DeGale said. 'But I'm not going to stay around for 2012 and after two years they come to me and say, no, there's someone else new. There will never be, next four years, nobody as good as me, trust me. They should never try to do that to me, otherwise I'll go pro and get \u00a31m. But deep in my heart, 2012, that's me. Terry stays, everything's nice, everything's cushty, Commonwealth Games, 2010, everything should work out nice. I've thought about this already. Everything's nice, I'd be knighted, that's me. We'll have to see.' </p> <p>There will be big offers on the table for him from the professionals. It would be very sad, though, if amateur boxing lost another star when the sport is on such a high. 'I'm going to go home, speak to my family. Sometimes it's hard to say to no to \u00a31m. But if they come back with something sensible that I could sign for four years, I could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and earn some decent dough. If I won another gold medal in 2012, in my home city, imagine that. To be the face of 2012, that'd be unbelievable. </p> <p>'Haven't seen my mum for ages - she's my life, she's my world. I'm going to Cyprus for five days, soon as I get back. She's out there now. Just enjoy my gold medal, the time off, whatever - six, seven weeks. Then I want to get back in the ring. That's me, that's my life, that's what I do.' </p> <p>And his father, who likes a bet, will be glad he knew what he was doing in that frantic final round. 'That won my dad \u00a311,000,' DeGale revealed. 'At 80-1 [before the tournament].' </p> <p>Now DeGale wants the nation to believe in him too. If the Amateur Boxing Association come up 'with some sensible cheddar', by which he means a four-year contract and more than the current \u00a31,500 a month he gets, the attraction of defending the gold in his home town should be enough to persuade him to stay in the crazy world of amateur boxing. </p> <p>Edwards, meanwhile, has the small issue of a minor insurrection to deal with. Despite bringing home a gold and two bronze medals for Great Britain, with a centrally funded programme that has revolutionised the sport, he has had to endure without much retaliation comments in the papers in the past week that suggest he cannot control his lively young squad of scallywags. </p> <p>Edwards said: 'I'm a very simplistic person anyway, but I really don't understand it. What more do they want? That now, hopefully, secures funding going forward to 2012 and maybe involves the programme. People all around Britain will have been watching that and hopefully now the profile of amateur boxing within Great Britain is going to be raised. </p> <p>'I shall face the music when I go back and answer all the allegations, but one thing's for certain: if I were to go forward for the next four years, I wouldn't put up with the crap that I've suffered in the last four years, that's for sure. </p> <p>'I've been passionate about it. I've believed that with the UK Sport money and the structure that I've put in place we could actually achieve this at the Olympic Games. If we can keep that funding in place and actually secure a little bit more sponsorship to retain some of these boxers - what James is talking about - I really believe that in 2012 we can be the new Cuba. I don't know what more they want of me.' </p> <p>Perhaps the most straightforward observation on the whole fiasco came in the uncomplicated argot of a bright-eyed jack-the-lad from north-west London, still clinging to his gold medal: 'All the stuff he's been getting at home, all the bullshit, it's not nice, man. He don't need this shit in his life. Look what he's produced, three medals. He must be doing something right. We've all got respect for him. If they had brought anyone else, we'd probably have taken the piss out of him or whatever. We've got respect from him, trust me.'</p>",
  "<p>It has not been the most edifying summer for the nation's footballing icons. It is extraordinary, really, that players such as Frank Lampard and Emmanuel Adebayor consider badge-kissing a reasonable gesture at the end of dreary media sagas in the name of a whacking pay rise. In their defence, they might argue they were only playing the game. Everybody's at it. Cristiano Ronaldo. Gareth Barry. Given half a chance, who wouldn't? Flirting through an agent, or via a conveniently placed back-page lead, is simply what footballers do nowadays when they want something. </p> <p>But the everybody's-at-it excuse simply doesn't wash. Even in this era of overbearing player power, some exceptionally talented players manage to increase their salary without whining to the papers or hiding behind the obnoxious claims of 'sources'. In 2006, without any fuss or attention, Cesc F\u00e1bregas penned an improved eight-year contract with his employers. At the time he was coveted enough to write his own terms with any European superclub. He could have increased his earnings if he had been prepared to kick up a stink, but he has better manners than that. </p> <p>Two years on and the young man is preparing for a new season with Arsenal after another summer in which he could have joined Ronaldo, Lampard, Adebayor et al without even trying. He found himself starring in many a mischievous transfer story emanating from Spain. His response? He swiftly knocked them all back, outlined his commitment to Arsenal and quietly got on with enjoying his well earned holidays. If he wants a pay rise he will do it without the help of a public inquiry, muchos gracias</p> <p>It is almost impossible for a young footballer thrust into gold-tinged celebrity to maintain perspective. F\u00e1bregas has, to the extent that conversation with him begs the wistful question: 'Why can't they all be like that?'</p> <p>F\u00e1bregas had more reason than most to remind himself how lucky he is last week when he toured the specialist teenage cancer unit of University College Hospital as part of Arsenal's support for their charity of the season. Afterwards he spent some time with another cool and confident 21-year-old making the best of his life. From a distance they looked like two mates hanging out, talking football and music. It just so happened that the other kid, Anthony Whitehead, discovered he had cancer three days before his 18th birthday. </p> <p>F\u00e1bregas was clearly moved by Anthony's story. Most people in that delicate age group are either lumped into the children's ward, or, as Anthony was, in with the over-sixties. He had nobody to talk to on his wavelength until he came into contact with the Teenage Cancer Trust. </p> <p>'At our age we think we know everything and we don't know anything. That's the truth,' F\u00e1bregas reflected afterwards. 'You have to fight for your dream but you also have to feel fortunate for what you have. Anthony kept fighting for his dream which was to beat cancer. He made it and now he has a bright future for sure. He went though so much, all alone in hospital with everyone around him 60 or 70 years old. I told him, \"Many congratulations because not everyone has this character.\" To see someone of my age have such an experience, and come through it happy and smiling, is unbelievable.'</p> <p>F\u00e1bregas looks, and feels, blessed. He is raring to get back out onto the pitch, which he expects to do on Wednesday night for the visit of FC Twente in the second leg of the Champions League third qualifying round. If there is a crisis at his club, as many have predicted in analysing the weaknesses in Arsenal's squad compared to their rivals, their talismanic No 4 does not appear to be feeling it. Despite losing three experienced midfield team-mates in Gilberto Silva, Mathieu Flamini and Alex Hleb during the close-season, F\u00e1bregas is not anxious. 'We have to accept that they are big players but the boss knows what he is doing,' he says, before pointing out that the transfer window is still very much open. He expects the missing link to arrive in good time. </p> <p>Naturally, he is a little disappointed to lose such close midfield allies, but he is also slightly baffled as to why they were so keen to move on. 'I cannot remember any player who left Arsenal and has been a superstar,' he muses. 'Don't get me wrong, Alex Hleb and Mathieu Flamini are two of my best friends in football and I wish them all the best. I speak to them every week and I know how they feel - I am not going to tell you - but Arsenal is Arsenal. This club has something special that no others have. We have to take care of it.' </p> <p>Why does he feel so loyal? What is this something special? 'I have a lot of friends in Spain and Italy and when they speak about other clubs I know I am privileged to be where I am. I don't want to lose it. I want to win things for the club. I want to get experience here. I want to play for Arsenal. When you see football all around the world you see very few teams who play the way that we play. I just enjoy it. I feel it is my home now.' </p> <p>The sentiment is admirable. But surely there is only so long that happiness can mask the desire for trophies, especially as F\u00e1bregas is fresh from the elation of summer success on the international stage. The critics who doubt if Arsenal have a group strong enough to mount a challenge cannot all be wrong. </p> <p>'We are not a squad with 25 international players like Chelsea,' he explains. 'We are a bit shorter because the boss wants to keep everyone happy, with everyone fighting for a place and knowing they have a chance. When you have six or seven important injuries, as we did last season, that's unfortunate. But in the League four points [the number Arsenal finished behind the champions] is not a lot to make up. </p> <p>'Right now we are competitive, but in the middle we need someone who can compete and give us another dimension we are missing. That's all we need,' he says. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger made some cryptic comments about Barry last week, but F\u00e1bregas cannot disguise his enthusiasm for his Spain team-mate Xabi Alonso. 'I'd love it!' he beams. 'What can I say. He is my friend and apart from that he is a great professional, a great passer of the ball, he works hard defensively, he's scoring goals now, he's experienced and he's only 26. For me he would be perfect.' </p> <p>So has he spoken to him about a possible move south from Liverpool? 'Erm... No,' is the attempted reply, but F\u00e1bregas cannot stop himself from breaking into peals of laughter. He is a man of many talents, but fibbing evidently is not one of them. </p> <p>It is still striking how much top-level experience he has mustered. How many 21-year-olds have played well over 200 matches for club and country, including the finals of the European Championship, Champions League, FA Cup and Carling Cup? His importance to Arsenal from the control room of central midfield cannot be overstated. Over the summer he made himself almost as indispensable for Spain with a series of spectacular cameos.</p> <p>He is quick to point out that his international squad was not particularly old. 'We were probably the second youngest side at the European Championship with Spain and we won the tournament,' he says. The notion that Arsenal are too young, too naive to succeed irks a little. 'Some people say, because we are young, that we are working for the future. I don't see it like this and the boss doesn't either. You just have to believe in what you can achieve this season. There are always people around who want to put you down. At Arsenal we have to stick together, the players and the fans, we have to be strong and keep fighting for our objectives.'</p> <p>There is no objective higher than the Champions League. That subject inevitably drifts towards Arsenal's 2006 final against Barcelona. His team were 14 minutes away from lifting the trophy against his boyhood club. Does he think about it often? 'Not really,' he says, as if the answer is surprising even to himself. 'It's the one I think less about. I don't know why. We were all devastated after that final, but I must say afterwards we realised that Arsenal was a big club and we could compete against anyone. To play a final against Barcelona with 10 men from the first few minutes, and they didn't come back until the last few minutes, it was really impressive. It was devastating but we were quite proud. For our mental aspect it was very, very positive. </p> <p>'We have learned we don't have to be afraid of anyone. We've seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody. You have to be positive and you have to believe you can do it again - at least make it to the final. I've played a few finals now and you can see anything can happen.' </p> <p>The memory of last season's dramatically charged European fallout at Anfield in the quarter-finals is sore enough for F\u00e1bregas to volunteer a rare 'no comment'. He prefers to focus on the positives, such as the eye-catching dismantling of Milan in the last 16 - a performance that amply demonstrated the leadership and inspiration F\u00e1bregas bestows on his team. </p> <p>William Gallas may wear the armband, but the Catalan who is 10 years his junior provides a significant amount of direction within the camp. F\u00e1bregas would welcome the captaincy one day. 'I would love it,' he enthuses. 'I respect all decisions. I am a player that accepts nearly everything. I am happy with everything, my No 4, playing for Arsenal in centre midfield and giving 100 per cent every, every game. But if the boss thinks in one or two years I am ready to be captain, I will take the armband.' </p> <p>Considering he talks as good a game as he plays these days, that honour would be entirely deserved. And he would not have to get his agent to tell the papers how much he wanted it - or else! - in order to make it happen.</p> <p>Donate to the teenage cancer trust at www.beagoonerbeagiver.org</p>",
  "<p>Just about any team in the First Division can still win the pennant, though this is probably only a mathematical possibility in the case of Surrey and Hampshire. And you can be fairly sure that Lancashire, despite their mighty income and the number of internationals they boast, would be relieved to remain in the top tier after a fractious season.</p> <p>Yesterday they lost to Kent at Canterbury by 211 runs, hardly a surprise after they had been outplayed for the first three days. Mark Chilton, last year's captain, but playing only his third Championship match of a wretched season, hit a gutsy century, delaying the inevitable. Once Chilton had gone the Lancashire tail subsided - although wicketkeeper Luke Sutton offered some resistance with 34 - against the off-breaks of James Tredwell and Martin van Jaarsveld.</p> <p>Captain Stuart Law, a victim of back spasms on the second day, batted at eight and was caught and bowled for a duck. Dominic Cork, not required by the club next season, hit 18 in 12 balls, probably not playing for the draw. Lancashire appear to be in freefall. The decision to dispense with Cork can be understood. They are an ageing side. At some point they have to rebuild even if it means dispensing with the feistiest 37-year-old on the circuit. What is extraordinary is that Cork has been jettisoned without the club captain having a say. This must have incensed Law partly because he wanted Cork to be retained, but also because in a sane world he would expect to be consulted. We may surmise that Law's relationship with the club's cricket manager, Mike Watkinson, can hardly be described as intimate. Law's contract with the club ends this year and given the events of the last fortnight I would not like to guarantee that he will be leading Lancashire in 2009. He may not even be playing for them.</p> <p>After this victory, Kent are seven points ahead of Lancashire, but Robert Key, their captain, has a far firmer hand on the tiller of his club, which has never experienced Second Division Championship cricket.</p> <p>The other match in the First Division, between Surrey and Sussex at The Oval, was drawn. Surrey, like Lancashire, have appear to be a creaking side with plenty of big names growing old together. A 30-year old loanee caught the eye yesterday. Alex Tudor, back in Surrey's colours after his three-year exodus to Essex, took a couple of quick wickets in the fourth innings.</p> <p>In the Second Division, Worcestershire romped to their sixth victory of the summer in a run chase at Colchester. Essex's captain, Mark Pettini, set the visitors 347 on the final day. Maybe he forgot that his key man, Danish Kaneria, had fractured his finger earlier in the match and will not play again this season. The beneficiaries of his absence were Daryl Mitchell, who hit a century, Ben Smith and old Graeme Hick, who finished them off.</p> <p>At Lord's, Middlesex, who have a young side (Shaun Udal apart) were left with no alternative, but to bat out for a draw against Leicestershire. One of their bright sparks, Dawid Malan, who batted for longer than anyone else, and veteran Udal were there at stumps.</p> <p>Normally we would not focus too much on the Pro40 in its penultimate season. But there were some astonishing pyrotechnics at Taunton. Those watching with anguish as Ian Bell was doing his level best to open the batting for England at Headingley on Friday, would have inevitably mumbled: 'Not since Marcus Trescothick...'</p> <p>Well, Trescothick went on the attack against Gloucestershire yesterday, hitting 184 from 112 balls, the highest score in one-day cricket by a Somerset batsman. Early on he just tapped five boundaries in an over against Steve Kirby and the alarm bells clanged in the Gloucestershire camp. His hundred came from 68 balls and in all he hit 20 fours and six sixes as Somerset amassed 333 for four. 'It was great fun,' said Trescothick.</p> <p>He combined with Craig Kieswetter to add 302 for the second wicket. Kieswetter's 121 was relatively pedestrian, although there were some mighty blows. It took 107 balls. He is South African-born and a wicketkeeper, and will qualify for England in a couple of years. The selectors have already made a note. Yet Gloucestershire won the match via Duckworth-Lewis by 12 runs. Mark Hardinges, sacked by the club earlier in the week, cracked an unbeaten 80 in 62 balls. Perhaps we should feel sorrier for him than Cork.</p>",
  "<p>'Don't be a show off,' was my mother's perpetual mantra. 'If you get above yourself, they'll only bring you down.' Second in the class; not good enough, should have been top. A place at Hull University; Oxbridge would have been better. A much coveted job on Radio Bristol; pity they wouldn't be able to hear me in Barnsley. It was, as it turns out, extremely effective training in surviving a culture that routinely builds 'em up and brings 'em down with shocking and wounding regularity. </p> <p>And what a pity it is that we undermine confidence with blithe disregard and seem to glory in those fallen from grace. Take Jade Goody, a young innocent, catapulted into the public eye by the lure of fame and fortune via Big Brother. She used her notoriety well, setting up a successful business and dragging herself out of the unprepossessing future her poor and ill-educated background had promised. </p> <p>Her capacity for bouncing back and trying to do the right thing is admirable. She landed herself in spectacularly hot water after a bitchy comment, widely construed as racist, about one of her fellow 'celebrity' inhabitants of the claustrophobic house, Indian film actress Shilpa Shetty. </p> <p>In a hapless attempt to restore her reputation, Jade agreed to take part in the Indian version of the show, only to find herself sobbing in the diary room as the dread news that she has cervical cancer was delivered over the phone. How the mighty fell. With what apparent delight the pictures were flashed around the world. How utterly ashamed we should be for watching her weep on television news and seeing her hounded as she arrived home at the airport, crying still.</p> <p>There were tears of relief in schools around the country this month as exam results were delivered and teenagers, screeching and hugging each other with delight, flashed their letters at the press cameras and flaunted their As and A*s. Better marks than ever in both GCSE and A-levels.</p> <p>But could we pat them graciously on the back, praising their hard work and determination to do well? Of course not. The ancient sages who fill the comment pages of our national newspapers looked back to their own old days when, they claim, an A really meant something and knocked down the current generation with a repetition of the now familiar annual cry that today's exams are too easy and we're simply raising a generation of deluded, ignorant fools. Will it be any wonder if, after they've done their best, but it was not enough, they slide into anger and apathy?</p> <p>Then there was the Enid Blyton debacle. How, rose the cry, could she possibly have come out top of the list of favourite authors, as cliche-ridden and unchallenging as she is? No matter that her popularity, years after her death, is phenomenal. She still sells more copies worldwide than virtually any other author and her tales of adventure have brought millions of children to a love of reading, but slapping her down seems to be a required response.</p> <p>And it's not only the British who slap down showy success. I didn't expect to be captured by the Olympics, having hated sport of all forms for as long as I can remember, but even I couldn't fail to be dragged in by the amazing Usain Bolt. As he crossed the line in the 100 and 200 metre races, and latterly played his part in the 4x100m relay, breaking every record in the book, he threw out his arms in triumph and hurled himself at the cameras, grinning and glorying in his speed. </p> <p>Not good enough. Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, roundly ticked him off. He should have shown more restraint; not gone over the top with his celebrations; demonstrated more respect for his fellow contestants. For goodness sake, this is the fastest man on the planet and his enthusiasm and delight was infectious. His unrestrained pride in a job well done had me smiling all week.</p> <p>The Americans don't suffer from this insistence on false modesty. Ask anyone who's regularly involved in public speaking where time is given for the audience to ask questions. How you hope for an American in the crowd. They'll always be the fearless first to come forward and start the ball rolling. Their children are unashamed to show and tell; to try and fail and then try and try again, never afraid that they'll be slapped down for flaunting their abilities.</p> <p>They can, of course, be a pain. Years ago in Paris, an old tour guide told me a story of a day he'd spent showing an American the sights.</p> <p>At Notre Dame, he explained it had taken thousands of Frenchmen many years to construct. The American said they had such a thing back home that had been built in a month. Same story at Sacr\u00e9 Coeur. When they came to the Eiffel Tower, the guide said nothing and the American asked what it was. 'No idea,' said my friend, 'it wasn't there this morning.' There's a lesson there. If the French can top the Americans, so can we.</p>",
  "<p>When the Notting Hill riots started 50 years ago, I had been in a London school for two-and-a-half years. I was 14 and it was probably the biggest, most dramatic event in my life up to that time, but nothing about it was totally astonishing, because it was precisely the sort of event I had been fearing since I arrived.</p> <p>Today, walking around London with my teenage son, it's hard to explain why it was no great surprise back then, as those first pictures of howling mobs chasing black men through the streets were shown around the world. Struggling to make sense of it, I tell him that I knew what was happening simply because of what I saw and what I felt about all the little things that went to make up our ordinary everyday life then. I tell him that the past is a different country and the differences are most noticeable not in the big changes, but in the small, unremarkable happenings.</p> <p>Since 1958, there have been laws intended to prevent or inhibit the sort of violent assaults that we saw in Notting Hill, beginning with the draconian sentences handed out to some of the worse offenders. Then came the Race Relations Act followed by various tranches of immigration legislation, followed by new housing provisions and so on and so on. In the wake of all this, myths have grown up around the Notting Hill riots. Explanations for them abound. From the left come cries of poverty and deprivation, housing need and frustration. From the right, the Powellite agenda, which rationalises the riots in terms of liberal bullying of a neglected working class, discredited but still with resonance, resurfacing from time to time in one guise or another. In recent years, another (black) myth has begun to emerge, one that places the riots at the beginning of an official multicultural cause, exemplified by the Notting Hill Carnival this weekend.</p> <p>All of these are certain to show up in any discussion about the meaning of the Notting Hill riots. In all the commentary, however, there is one element that is routinely neglected. That is about how people feel about themselves and about the undramatic routine of their lives, the everyday events that dictate how happy we can be in our environment. Last week, I went to a supermarket late in the evening. It was all routine. My partner and I were feeling rather giggly, partly because the teenage son was away for the night. Halfway down the first aisle, we encountered a young white woman stacking shelves and she began bantering with us. I don't remember what she said, but we all laughed uproariously. At the checkout, there was an Asian girl wreathed in smiles. It struck me that this was an experience which is absolutely normal, but would have been unimaginable 50 years ago. </p> <p>Looking back, what I remember is being surrounded by an atmosphere of suspicion, indifference or hostility. In those days, out in public, if you smiled or spoke to a white person you didn't know, the response was most likely to be concern, offence or even physical assault. It was safer not to speak to anyone, because any encounter could provoke a racist jibe. Pick up the local newspaper and you were certain to read reports, features or letters which were offensive or threatening or downright racist. Switch on the radio and you were certain to hear an interview, or a speech or joke, which reminded you that you were the object of your neighbours' anger, dislike or contempt. That was 1958 and that was a different country and there was a sense in which the Notting Hill riots summed up what I could feel around me every time I went out of the house. </p> <p>I don't feel that today. Nowadays, I am a relatively respectable gent of a certain age and no one has in for me, unless they know who I am. It is easy to note the contrasts with that other time, 50 years ago, in the ease with which most black people navigate the city. This isn't the case only in London. I could say similar things about Leeds or Birmingham or Manchester. In any number of routine encounters, it is easy to appreciate the extent to which the country has changed. Coming back from abroad, I don't feel even the smallest part of the caution I used to. This country is home. </p> <p>On the other hand, it is impossible to escape the realisation that, for many, more recent migrants, the city offers an experience which feels uncomfortably like the way it was for black migrants in the Fifties. In the last few months, I've heard more than one diatribe directed at assistants in shops or banks, beginning with the familiar: 'You people ...' and ending with the suggestion that the object of the abuse should 'go back where you came from'. A familiar narrative which I would have labelled racist, had it not been for the fact that the abuser was black and the abused an embarrassed European or African.</p> <p>This, I tell myself, is simply one moving part of the mechanism which changes the country and its population. The process of engagement, whether it's difficult, hostile or even violent, is a fundamental part of this change and no one can stop it. All we can do is moderate its worst effects.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mike Phillips is the co-author of Windrush: Irresistible Rise of Multi-racial Britain</p>",
  "<p>On a short flight to New York recently, I was sitting behind two white, well-dressed twentysomethings chattering loudly about going to clubs and travel plans and the possibility of living in New Jersey. Then came the question: 'So who are you voting for?'</p> <p>'I was for Hillary, but now ... I'm kind of undecided,' volunteered the first woman. 'Are you a Democrat?' asked the second. 'Yeah. But I think I might go with McCain. It's just that, well, I don't know.' Her voice dropped. I leant forward to hear. 'You kind of hate to say it aloud, but ...' Her voice dropped again, lost in the roar of the jet engines, and I missed whatever came next.</p> <p>Let's start with this concession: I have no idea what that young woman actually said. In a perfect world, I suppose that would be the end of the story and I would go back to minding my own business. In the context of contemporary political discourse, however, it did cross my mind that, if this conversation was presented on one of those 'finish the sentence' cultural-literacy tests, then pretty much every American, of whatever creed, colour, or class, would have exactly the same guess as to how the woman completed her thought.</p> <p>There's some consensus, in other words, about the one thing in America we really 'hate to say' aloud. Yet by refraining from saying audibly that-which-must-not-be-spoken, was the young woman's political choice rendered rational, neutral, pure? Conversely, if I were to spell it out here, would I be the one accused of 'playing the race card'?</p> <p>Everyone knows that race matters to a greater or lesser degree; few of us want to admit it. Indeed, race is the one topic that's probably even more taboo in polite company than sex.</p> <p>Barack Obama predicted this phenomenon and attempted to expose it to the anodyne of common sense: 'They're going to try to make you afraid of me. \"He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\" ' The not altogether surprising backlash from John McCain's campaign is a deflection, an expression of deep discomfort. The reflexive accusation that Obama was playing the race card has a certain resemblance to the juvenile retort one gets when the science teacher tries to explain the human reproductive system: 'Oh! He said a dirty word!' In this way, the opportunity for thoughtful public analysis sinks, once again, below the sound of the audible. Yet the fear of race rolls on, pantomimed in palpably influential and consequential ways.</p> <p>At the same time the civil rights movement has given us a moral conscience that was not as prevalent when The Birth of a Nation was made. Today it's fair to say that the overwhelming majority of white Americans 'hate to say it aloud' because they also hate to think of themselves as racists. Yet the tendency to turn the commitment to racial liberalism into sheer denial is strong. 'I don't see race' becomes 'I don't see racism'. While some of us are listening to the soothing tones of National Public Radio, a far larger audience is listening to the right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh singing about subterranean fears of 'Barack, the magic Negro', or to shock jocks cackling about 'jigaboos'. Not that any of them mean it in a racist way. Hey, lighten up. Don't you have a sense of humour?</p> <p>Then there are the very real disparities that burden the lives of the majority of blacks, people of colour and the poor in this country: from the still unrepaired wake of Hurricane Katrina to the greater infant mortality rate and lesser life span, to near double-digit rates of unemployment, to the fact that blacks in New York are eight times more likely than whites to be stopped for marijuana possession, to disproportionately high rates of foreclosures and homelessness among blacks, Native Americans and Latinos, to the almost complete resegregation of schools across the land, to a war on drugs so shockingly racialised and so aggressively executed that our rates of incarceration place us first in the world.</p> <p>We rejoice in the warm symbolism of interracial bliss, particularly in the idealised and thoroughly mythic sphere of celebrity existence. At the same time, there is a terrible ambivalence on the ground. Does one really want 'the race card' living next door, or being your boss? Do you really want your child marrying outside his race? I've had conversations with white friends who are rattled when a black pupil has bested their child in the class rankings and can't let go of the feeling that the mere presence of blacks in the school must be bringing down the test scores.</p> <p>Similarly, it's interesting to review the evolution of media commentary, from TV to the blogosphere, trying to fit the thoroughly unfamiliar Obama into familiar boxes. For a while, he was depicted as not having any 'racial baggage'. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was transformed into someone who could be demonised with all the well-practised repertoire of insults reserved for the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan and armed revolutionaries.</p> <p>Obama's comeback, his eloquent speech about race, showed that he wasn't exactly the same person, not by any means. So in yet another twist, he is now so uppity he needs bringing down, defamed as too famous, categorised as uncategorisable, displaced as unplaceable. Yet the truth is that more is on the record about every step of Obama's life than possibly any candidate on the planet, and so this particular brand of demonisation has been accomplished by the insinuations of erasure.</p> <p>If you took away his 'pretty words', he'd be nothing. If you took away his race, he'd be nothing. If only he didn't have a brain, he'd be nothing, nothing, nothing. It's a circular, nonsensical mantra - magical thinking, wrapped in the fiction of 'but really, I never see race'. This kind of denial masquerading as colour-blind idealism cannot be our compass at this exciting and potentially transformative moment.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Patricia Williams is a professor of law at Columbia University and a regular columnist for the Nation magazine</p>",
  "<p>Few people who read Alex Haley\u2019s 1976 novel Roots, which told of his African slave ancestor Kunta Kinte, will forget the shock of those descriptions of the slave ships and the brutality of the plantations, nor the shame and anger that accompanied it. But how do you maintain that shock over atrocities 200 years old without people feeling they have heard the story before?</p> <p>Bernardine Evaristo, of British and Nigerian descent, has come up with an ingenious way of refreshing the horrors of the slave trade: by creating a photographic negative of historical reality, where what was black becomes white and vice versa. The epigraph she takes from Nietzsche underlines the point of such a reversal: \u2018Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.\u2019 In Blonde Roots, \u2018whyte Europanes\u2019 are enslaved by \u2018blak Aphrikans\u2019 and shipped either to the plantations in the imaginary West Japanese Islands (so-called because a famous Aphrikan explorer was sailing round the world in search of Asia when he landed there, and the name stuck) or to serve wealthy blak families in the island of Great Ambossa, where the plantation owners live.</p> <p>The world of Blonde Roots, in which young Doris Scagglethorpe (known by her slave name of Omorenomwara) must attempt to escape from her master if she hopes to see her family again, is not a straightforward parallel of the 18th-century landscape of the slave trade\u2019s heyday. Rather, it is a slightly surreal, alternative reality, embracing multiple historical epochs, in which every instance of racial and colonial prejudice is inverted. The England of Doris\u2019s childhood is medieval and feudal, but Great Ambossa, the small but wealthy island off the main continent of Aphrika, with its capital of Londolo, shares features of our age with aspects of a futuristic dystopia. Under the city streets runs a long-disused underground railway, used by the resistance to help slaves escape. Parties of blak tourists take trips into the whyte ghettos to marvel at the poverty as tourists do now to the townships of South Africa; the Ambossan working classes shout abuse at the few free whytes who live in the suburbs - \u2018Wigger, go home! You\u2019re taking our jobs!\u2019</p> <p>This is Evaristo\u2019s first novel entirely in prose - her background is as a poet and her first three books were all partly in verse - but her language retains its musicality and exuberance, particularly in Doris\u2019s un-self-pitying, drily comic tone. Language itself becomes a source of comedy in the novel\u2019s final section, when Doris ends up in the West Japanese plantations and learns the slaves\u2019 patois.</p> <p>The book divides into three parts, the first and third narrated by Doris, the middle by her slave master, Chief Kaga Konata Katamba I (whose slaves are branded with his initials), who talks like an old Etonian. Some details are funny - the whyte hair salons in the suburbs, where whyte women spend painful hours having Aphro hair extensions woven into their limp, blond locks; the prejudices of the law - \u2018Naturally, having a whyte skin was all the evidence the sheriffs needed to accost a young man and strip-search him\u2019.</p> <p>But at times it feels that Evaristo is so intent on establishing the details of her alternative world that the emotional reality takes a while to catch up. In the third section, however, the reader is given more space to engage with their emotional lives. After a whipping that leaves her scarred for life, Doris is sent to a plantation run by her master\u2019s son as punishment for trying to escape. Here, she becomes part of the community of whytes who have lived for several generations in slavery and who, despite the threat of brutality that hovers over them, have carved out a life that includes makeshift family ties, solidarity and kindness.</p> <p>You find yourself rooting for Doris and her companions on their second escape attempt in a way that you never did during her first, having almost forgotten that these characters, with their dialect and African names, are supposed to be white, their cruel, drunk masters black. It is this that makes Blonde Roots more than just a clever satire on race and achieves what one presumes the author intended: to remind us that \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 could so easily have been reversed, and that regarding someone as less than fully human is the root of all tyranny.</p>",

  "<p>In 1969, a year after Russian tanks rolled into Prague, Josef Koudelka visited London with a Czech theatre group. One Sunday morning he was walking out of his hotel near the Aldwych Theatre when he saw some members of the theatre group perusing a copy of the Sunday Times magazine. As he passed, he saw to his surprise that they were looking at his own extraordinary photographs of that Russian invasion and the spontaneous street protests it provoked. The same photos have since become the definitive pictorial record of a pivotal event in 20th century history.</p> <p>'They showed me the magazine where it said that these pictures had been taken by an unknown photographer from Prague and smuggled out of the country,' he says, shaking his head as if he still cannot believe it. 'I could not tell anyone that they were my photographs. It was a very strange feeling. From that moment, I was afraid to go back to Czechoslovakia because I knew that if they wanted to find out who the unknown photographer was, they could do it.'</p> <p>Before he returned to Prague, Koudelka began making preparations to leave again, this time for good. He began by contacting the Magnum photographic agency, which had placed his work in the Sunday Times, attributing the images to PP (Prague Photographer) lest he and his family should suffer reprisals. Magnum subsequently wrote a letter to the Czech Ministry of Culture saying they had given him a grant to photograph Gypsies across Europe. It worked. In 1970, when his visa ran out, Koudelka did not return home. Suddenly stateless, he too became a kind of Gypsy, constantly on the move, forsaking the very notion of a homeland.</p> <p>So began perhaps the most remarkable journey in 20th century photography. When I meet him today, in the back room of his new apartment in Prague, Koudelka unfolds a battered map of the world he has just found in one of the many boxes stacked along a wall. It is covered in spidery ink trails that trace his wanderings through Europe and beyond, his handwriting providing a runic commentary of the festivals and gatherings he attended along the way. The map dates from the Seventies and looks like a strange work of art, which, in a way, it is. The real art, though, lies in the photographs Koudelka produced when he began chronicling his restlessness - and rootlessness - as well as his newfound sense of freedom. His first major work, published in 1975, was called simply Gypsies, his second, from 1988, Exiles. Their titles alone tell you much about Koudelka's own life as well as the lives of his subjects.</p> <p>'For 17 years I never paid any rent,' he says, laughing and raising a shot glass of slivovic, a plum brandy he has produced to welcome me to Prague. 'Even the Gypsies were sorry for me because they thought I was poorer than them. At night they were in their caravans and I was the guy who was sleeping outside beneath the sky.'</p> <p>Now, 38 years after he began his exile, and 40 years after the invasion, Josef Koudelka has a place in Prague that, were he so inclined, he could call home. It is an apartment on the corner of a quiet square near the city centre, opposite a church where, he tells me proudly, the young Dvorak once wrote music. It is light, airy and purely functional: a place to work rather than rest. The boxes of notebooks, meticulously classified, suggest a highly ordered mind. 'Josef is utterly methodical, and utterly aware of his own legend and his legacy,' says his close friend, the photographer, Eliott Erwitt. 'But he is also an eccentric. He thinks differently, and, as we know from the work, he sees the world differently.'</p> <p>At 70, Koudelka has, like his late friend Henri Cartier-Bresson, achieved semi-mythic status as a photographer. Alongside Robert Frank, he is the last of the great hard-bitten romantics of 20th century reportage, and, like Frank, he is a hero of mine. Gypsies was the first photography book I ever owned, and though I cannot remember now how I came by it, I can still recall its impact on me. I was studying in London for a degree in English, and Gypsies seemed to me to possess a more powerful narrative than many of the contemporary novels I was reading. I looked at it again in preparation for this interview, and found it still retains the power to mesmerise with its raw beauty, its essential sadness. There is something beautifully melancholic in Koudelka's images, a sadness the Portuguese call saudade, a deep-rooted longing for which there is no equivalent word in English. </p> <p>When I mention this, he nods in agreement. 'The mother of my son, an Italian lady, she once told me, \"Josef, you go though life and get all this positive energy, and all the sadness, you just throw it behind you and it drops into the bag you carry on your back. Then, when you photograph, it all comes out.\" Perhaps there could be some truth in that.' </p> <p>Koudelka, his youthful face framed by white straggly hair, has the demeanour of someone 20 years younger, and proves to be a generous and engaging host. He offers me his old flat in the suburbs of Prague to stay in, and insists on paying for lunch and drinks two days running. He famously does not grant many interviews and, one senses, astutely maintains his own mythology by his silence. Today, though, the anecdotes flow as freely as the wine. </p> <p>Koudelka has returned to Prague from his adopted home in Paris for an exhibition of his '68 photographs that is being held in the Old Town Hall to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the invasion. A book called Invasion 68: Prague was published earlier this year, an extraordinary chronicle of those convulsive seven days when the people of Prague, young and old, took to the streets in their thousands to protest at the Russian presence.</p> <p>'For a long time no one here was interested in remembering,' says Koudelka, 'but now I think they start to remember again. If this book helps the remembering I am happy. We Czechs are not like you Irish or the Poles. We do not behave bravely many times against the odds, but in this one week, as my book shows, we should be very proud of how we behave.' </p> <p>In that one week, the 30-year-old Koudelka took over 5,000 photographs on the streets of Prague, often under extreme conditions. He was shot at by a Russian soldier, and pursued through the crowds and into the backstreets around Wenceslas Square. In the short film that ends the exhibition, a young and scrawny Koudelka is seen perched on a Russian tank, filming a young Czech man waving a flag of resistance. </p> <p>Some of the people in the photographs turned up for the opening of the show, including a man whose arm Koudelka had positioned in the foreground of an empty Prague street, the watch on his wrist telling the time of the invasion. 'Forty years have gone by,' says Koudelka, 'and I do not remember them nor they me. You cannot rely on your memories - but you can rely on your pictures.'</p> <p>Back then, he says, he did not even know the word 'photojournalism'. 'I had not seen Life or Paris Match. For me, it was just important to photograph what I was part of.' To this end, he used a primitive Exakta camera and countless rolls of cinema film that he had bought cheaply from a friend, and which he cut into strips, then draped over his shoulder and fed into the camera. 'I used to have to run home to reload, always thinking I was missing something. Once, I think it saved my life. I was reloading when I heard the explosion that killed many people outside the radio station.' Until now, remarkably, the world has only seen 10 of those images. </p> <p>'Originally, I did not want to make the book or the exhibition,' he says. 'I knew already I had selected the 10 best. And, to be truthful, when I was working on this book, I did not discover one that I would have added to these 10. They are the ones that have a universal value. In them it is not so important who is Russian and who is Czech. It is more important that one man has a gun and one man has not.'</p> <p>The previously unseen images, though, are powerful for different reasons. They provide a unique visual record of 20th century history as it unfolded, an event of incredible emotional and political intensity that lasted a week yet changed the course of a nation for two decades afterwards. In one brilliantly composed image after another, Koudelka has also captured the energy of mass protest like no one before or since, an energy that flared from angry disbelief into violent protest and then faded just as suddenly. 'When I look at these pictures now, I can't believe I did them. Magnum could not believe it was the work of one photographer. I was everywhere because everywhere I looked in those seven days there is another photograph waiting for me. I did not have time to even think about the danger.'</p> <p>In one unforgettable image he snapped a tiny old man on his way to work, briefcase in hand, who suddenly stopped to hurl a cobblestone at a Russian tank. In another, he captured a young man holding his coat open as if inviting a nervous soldier on a tank to shoot him in the heart. In another, a pretty woman pleads with the Russian commander who stares over her head, implacable, imperious. </p> <p>'In truth, I felt no hatred for these soldiers,' he says now. They were not responsible for this. They were young like me, and we were in the same system. What happened to them could easily have happened to me. They could have woken me one morning and sent me to Warsaw or wherever they wanted. Back then, none of us was free.'</p> <p>The pursuit of freedom is what has fuelled Koudelka's life ever since, and that has manifested itself in a desire to be constantly on the move. Initially, when he began living in London in 1970, unable to speak English very well, he used the large Bayswater flat of fellow Magnum photographer David Hurn as his base. </p> <p>'It was nicknamed the Dosshouse,' says Hurn, 'because every struggling photographer passed though there at the time and slept on the floor. Josef was brought there by Elliot [Erwitt], who had been involved in helping him get out of Czechoslovakia, and the understanding was that he would be staying a few weeks. Like everyone else, he asked if he could use my darkroom to develop some film. He turned up with 800 rolls. I think, in the end, he stayed there off and on for about nine years.'</p> <p>London was his base in the winter but, come the summer, he would head off on his travels across Europe, rucksack and sleeping bag slung over his shoulders. He photographed Gypsies at the Epsom races and Appleby Horse Fair, pilgrims on St Patrick's Mountain and Lough Derg in Ireland, and itinerant musicians in Spain and Portugal, always travelling light and with little money, always sleeping in the open air. Like all great photographers he possesses an eye for telling detail and a formal mastery that, even in his snatched reportage, seems uncanny in its compositional brilliance. In one startling image that has haunted me since I first saw it, a bewildered young Gypsy in handcuffs stands alone on a hill while in the middle distance a line of people, and a few uncertain-looking policemen, stand watching like onlookers in an absurdist drama. The man, it turns out, had just been arrested and charged with murdering his wife. </p> <p>The Gypsies he photographed called Koudelka the 'romantico clandestino'. 'I photograph only something that has to do with me,' he says, 'and I never did anything that I did not want to do. I do not do editorial and I never do advertising. No, my freedom is something I do not give away easily. And I do not follow the war because I am not interested in photographing violence. Sure, if I was in Georgia now, I would be photographing what happens.'</p> <p>He stops, shakes his head, and reaches for another glass of wine. 'You know, people say, \"Oh, Josef, he is the eternal outsider,\" but on the contrary I try always to be an insider, both as a photographer and as a man. I am part of everything that is around me.'</p> <p>Koudelka was born in a village of 400 people in Moravia in 1938, close to where Milan Kundera, that other famous Czech exile, grew up. As a child, he was fascinated by folk music, planes and the family photographs the local baker took on a Bakelite camera. 'Once I saw the bread man's camera, I went off every day to the woods to pick wild strawberries to sell to the man who made ice-cream. In this way I saved the money to buy a camera of my own.' </p> <p>When he moved to Prague to study engineering, Koudelka fell under the influence of Jiri Janicek, who ran a photographic club for students. Soon he was contributing to a theatre magazine called Divadio, where he published his first serious body of work: intense, close-up portraits of the actors in rehearsal. Until 1967, though, he worked as an aeronautical engineer in Prague and Bratislava. 'It was fantastic because I loved aeroplanes as much as photographs,' he says, 'but there came a point where I knew that if I stayed in engineering, I would surely die. I had no ambition to be the boss, and I had all the responsibility for the people's safety. With a camera you are your own boss, responsible only to yourself. You are alone with the camera, there is no one else to blame.'</p> <p>Until the upheaval of Prague '68, Koudelka sought out and photographed Czechoslovakian Gypsies. Afterwards, in exile, and now a full-time member of Magnum, he forged an unlikely friendship with the agency's founder, the great French photographer, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and lived on small grants and awards while he searched out Gypsy communities across Europe. Between travels he would turn up out of the blue at the Magnum office in Paris and sleep there for weeks under a desk. His late father, he tells, me, used to send him home-brewed slivovic every month. 'It was a plastic bottle with the word vinegar written on it in Czech. This way, he thought I would not have to pay duty on it.' He became known around the Magnum office as 'Le Remplisseur Professionnel' (the professional pourer). 'After the first glass, no one can breathe,' he says, cracking up at the memory. 'After two, the girls are dancing around the floor.'</p> <p>Koudelka speaks without regret about his constant travelling. 'In Britain the Gypsy children would always ask me two questions: \"Do you sleep dressed?\" and \"When was the last time you saw your people?\" They were nomads but they returned to the same places every year and caught up with their own people. I think they pitied me because I could not do that.' </p> <p>When I ask David Hurn if Koudelka ever seemed homesick, he replies: 'Josef is not the sort of man to dwell on stuff like that but he would sometimes fall silent and take himself off somewhere.' He would often disappear into the kitchen to make mashed potatoes with caraway seeds. 'He seemed to live on this one dish, and, like his insistence on sleeping on the floor, I initially thought it was a kind of romantic affectation. Then one day his mother turned up from Prague to visit. She could not speak a word of English. One afternoon she said something. I asked Josef to translate, and he said, \"My mother just said how much she would love a big plate of mashed potatoes with caraway seed.\"'</p> <p>Though he has never maintained a long-term relationship, Koudelka has three children by three women in three countries: two grown-up daughters and a son of 13. Recently, when a teacher asked the boy what his father did, he replied, 'He's a nomad.' </p> <p>When pressed, Koudelka talks with pride about his children, but one detects regret too. 'Listen,' he says, when we meet the following day over a beer, and I broach the subject of family and commitment, 'I am not a family man and I can never be a family man. But I am very happy, I have children and I hope that they are happy that they exist. From the beginning I make certain rules with my children and one is that I can't be with them all the time. I tell them that when I am with them, I am for them, and when I am not there, it is best they should try to forget that I exist.' </p> <p>This flintiness exists side by side with his generosity of spirit, but essentially, one suspects, Koudelka is indeed a nomad and one of life's loners. Though he does not let people get too close he maintains many deep and abiding friendships. But one senses that his life, like his photography, is undergoing a profound change, and the new apartment in Prague is only the most visible sign that he can no longer maintain the nomadic lifestyle that framed his restless art and the arc of his younger life.</p> <p>In the last 10 years or so people have disappeared from his photographs altogether, and he now works obsessively on panoramic landscapes that often portray the devastation industrialisation has wreaked on the natural environment. He has two shows coming up in New York at the Aperture and Pace MacGill galleries, and he is also completing a long-term project that records the changing countryside near Piedmont, and considering a commission that would take him to Israel to document the so-called security wall that has annexed more land from the Palestinians.</p> <p>'If I go,' he says defiantly, 'it will be to photograph the wall not as a political problem but because of its devastation of the landscape. And this is monumental. I see this wall as a failure of civilisation. That is a subject for sure, but I need to know how the images will be used, and if I have creative control. This is one of the many important things I learn from Cartier-Bresson - you must always ask where the money comes from.'</p> <p>As we wind down over a last beer in a bar near his flat, I sense that Koudelka has grown impatient with all this questioning, but the mention of Cartier-Bresson sets him off on another bout of reminiscing. Earlier he had shown me a letter of introduction the French master sent to American photographer Cornell Capa ahead of Koudelka's first trip to the US. It says simply: 'I am sending you a madman called Josef.' </p> <p>What was the basis of his friendship with Cartier-Bresson? Koudelka thinks for a long while: 'We fight and disagree all the time,' he says, throwing back his head and laughing. 'He tries to tell me how to think, and I tell him exactly what I think, then he shouts, \"How can I have such a man in my house?\" This is how it could goes with us, and then it would be quickly forgotten. As a photographer I do not think he influenced me, but he helped me to understand how the profession worked. In fact I have learned so much from him, as a man, that it is impossible to put in words. He questioned everything all the time, and he was so full of generosity to me.' </p> <p>Not for the first time today, Koudelka's eyes fill up, but he drinks some more beer, and continues: 'Once, Henri rang me in Paris and said, \"Josef, Kert\u00e9sz is in town, you must come to dinner and meet him.\" He held Kert\u00e9sz in the highest regard as a photographic master. I said, \"Henri, I love his pictures but I do not need to meet him.\" The phone goes down. Then he rings back and says, \"No, you do not understand, you have to meet him because we three, we are of the same family.\" At the time, this seems to me to be an unbelievable thing to say. Now, though, when I look back from a distance, I can see that maybe there is something in that.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Invasion 68: Prague is published by Thames &amp; Hudson at \u00a329.95.

  "<p>Labour's attempts to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system have led to a huge rise in the criminalisation of people for minor offences, according to a key government adviser.</p> <p>Professor Rod Morgan, a former chief inspector of probation and the ex-chair of the Youth Justice Board, warns in a report released tomorrow that more people are ending up with criminal records owing to the increasing use of cautions and fixed-penalty notices handed out by the police. His comments are likely to strike a chord with a growing number of parents concerned that their children are receiving criminal records and having their personal details recorded on the DNA database even for minor offences. </p> <p>Morgan also suggests that, conversely, an increasing number of people convicted of violent offences may be receiving cautions rather than ending up before the courts. He says that the expansion of 'summary justice' - penalties that do not need to be handed down by the courts - needed to be 'more incisively scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively', adding: 'We cannot be wholly confident that this is the case.'</p> <p>The increased use of summary justice was hailed by Labour as a way of boosting public confidence in the law. The idea, according to Lord Falconer, the then Lord Chancellor who heavily promoted its use, was 'to connect the instance of crime much more quickly and directly with the consequences of crime'.</p> <p>But there are concerns that its widespread use is backfiring. The number of cautions has risen from 900,000 in 2002 to 1.4 million in 2006, the most recent figures available. Over the same period, the number of penalty notices for disorder has soared from 1,000 to 513,000.</p> <p>Such sanctions have in many cases replaced informal legal remedies such as a 'ticking off' from the local policeman. Morgan warns there is a risk that people 'will be criminalised where both common sense and the public interest suggest that informal control systems and informal sanctions would better apply'.</p> <p>His decision to speak will dismay the Ministry of Justice. Morgan sits on a government criminal justice advisory board and his long record as a civil servant suggests his views will gain wide attention. </p> <p>His report 'Summary justice: Fast but Fair?', published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, also questions whether the trend towards handing out cautions and penalty notices might have resulted in some serious offenders receiving lighter sentences than if they had ended up in court.</p> <p>Between 2001 and 2006 there has been a 92 per cent increase in the number of cautions handed down for serious violence against the person and a 267 per cent rise in cautions for common assault. The trend has resulted in an 'accountability deficit', according to Morgan, who points to significant regional variations in the use of penalties and cautions. In Dyfed Powys, for example, 61 per cent of indictable offences result in a caution, compared with a low of 21 per cent in Merseyside.</p> <p>Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said Morgan's report raised 'important questions about the consequences of government policies to divert minor offences from the courts'.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Fixed penalty notices and cautions enable police to deal swiftly with low-level offending, freeing them to spend more time on frontline duties and more time investigating violent, dangerous or sexual offences, as well as freeing court time for more serious offences.'</p>",

  "<p>Thefts of railway cable fuelled by soaring copper prices will cost Network Rail up to \u00a310m this year in repairs, train delays and extra security. Latest figures show that the number of hours lost due to stolen signalling cable across the network has almost doubled compared with last year. </p> <p>On the southern section of the West Coast Line, between Rugby and London Euston, the increase in delays is already eight times higher so far this year than in the whole of 2007. Thieves have been stealing the newly laid cable from multi-million pound track improvements.</p> <p>Rail chiefs and transport police say cable theft is now their biggest challenge after terrorism. Thefts cost the industry \u00a34m last year. As commodity prices rise, so do the number of incidents. Between April and July, nearly 2,000 hours were lost in service delays, compared with just over 4,000 hours for the whole of 2007.</p> <p>Extra money is now being ploughed into security measures, including surveillance helicopters. A 200-strong security task force has been set up to patrol the worst hit parts of the line, where thefts are affecting an \u00a38.8bn upgrade project to put 400 extra trains per day along routes to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow. </p> <p>A Network Rail spokesman said there had been a 'massive' thefts increase which would see disruption and security costs 'more than double' to at least \u00a310m. 'Action is being taken with extra security patrols using helicopters and private security personnel in hot-spot areas, police raids and watermarking cable. We are determined to make it as difficult as possible for these people and will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.'</p> <p>The thefts do not put passengers in danger, as a fail-safe system means the removal of cable turns all the signals red and brings trains to a halt, he stressed. </p> <p>A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'We are trying to choke off demand so there is nowhere to sell it. It's going through scrap dealers. So we are talking with them.'</p> <p>The industry is also looking to the courts to impose deterrent sentences. </p> <p>On Monday, a judge whose daily Manchester commute is regularly affected jailed one man caught red-handed for three years. Although the cabling was worth \u00a3500, Reece Gardiner, 41, sold it for just \u00a350. His actions caused 143 trains to be delayed, many for up to 24 hours, and cost Network Rail \u00a328,000. </p> <p>Sentencing him at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Roger Thomas said: 'The train I travel on is delayed regularly because people such as this defendant steal the cabling. This sort of offence is happening time and again, causing disruption and inconvenience and financial losses to many people.</p> <p>'This is a case that needs a deterrent sentence, and a message has to go from this court to others who may be minded to behave in the way you have'.</p>",
  "<p>A piercing whistle brings the lambs bounding up the hill, corralled into a tight, wild-eyed bundle by Fern, the sheepdog. Sunlight glints off the reservoir below, while beyond the heather-cloaked moors are shimmering purple.</p> <p>'Oh, it's a beautiful spot all right,' says farmer Peter Wood, 62, as he surveys his fields, bordered by proud drystone walls, high up in the Derbyshire Peak District. 'But if it wasn't for my lad working for me for next to nothing ... well, we might as well shut the door and be done with it. And that's a fact.'</p> <p>It's a sombre fact, but just one of many dictating government policy as a desperate battle is waged to protect the UK's uplands. Many Britons decamp on holiday to our spectacular highlands, but few realise how crucial they are to everyone's workaday lives. Moors, mountains, hills and valleys provide food, drinking water, a weekend recharge for urban-weary batteries, rare birds and butterflies, and a powerful arsenal in the escalating war against climate change.</p> <p>But their future is fragile. 'The uplands are facing a huge threat,' says Pat Thompson, uplands conservation officer at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). 'It's as urgent as standing here in 20 years' time with your grandchildren asking: \"What on earth were you lot doing in 2008?\" 'Erosion, the legacy of overgrazing, artificial drainage, unregulated burning of moorland, and industrial pollution of the atmosphere have degraded vast areas. Much is at stake, but the problem is that there are many stakeholders. And as the powerful environmental lobby captures the government's ear, there are competing interests, each with a voice to be heard.</p> <p>The fight to preserve the uplands has made them a battleground of tension and feud. The hill farmers' financial plight, the grouse shooters' wealth, rows over burning heather, accusations over poisoned birds of prey and water companies' demands - all are thorny issues that add up to a complex jigsaw. </p> <p>The National Trust is now calling on government to deliver a clear strategy. One immediate concern is keeping farmers on the hills. Dan Houseago, of the National Trust, says: 'We are asking farmers to do so much more than just produce a sheep. We are asking them to ensure a beautiful, colourful landscape, to protect all sorts of rare and wonderful birds, to provide lovely habitats for shooting and hunting, to give us clean drinking water and carbon storage as well as food. It's a big, big ask.'</p> <p>With declining incomes and an average age of 58, the farmers who work these challenging areas, where poor soil conditions leave few options other than raising sheep and cattle, are finding life very tough. Until recently, subsidies helped them to balance the books - the more livestock they raised, the more they got in payments. The hill farm allowance (HFA) compensated them for staying on the hills - a grant to safeguard rural communities in areas officially designated as 'less favoured'. </p> <p>But today, environmentalists point to damage caused by overgrazing, drainage and burning, the legacy of generations of farmers seeking to eke out a living. Now they receive payments for acreage rather than number of livestock to encourage them to de-stock, and other grants are stringently pegged to the environmental benefits they can provide for all of us.</p> <p>The result has been that upland farmers are being driven out, and sons and daughters are turning their backs on the family heritage. 'That is sending shock signals across the environmental movement,' says Thompson, 'because we recognise the incredibly important contribution that livestock and well-managed husbandry makes to the uplands. It's vital. We cannot afford to lose this incredibly skilled workforce, and right now we are losing them.' A new study indicates that sheep numbers have declined by up to 60 per cent in some areas of the Scottish uplands. Environment Secretary Hilary Benn announced last month that the hill farm allowance would be replaced by a special uplands environment payment in England.</p> <p>From too many grazing animals on our hills, the fear now is of too few. Grazing is essential to keep vegetation down, to prevent grass wastelands where little thrives. Well-managed upland is essential. The upland areas cover 40 per cent of Britain's land mass and provide 70 per cent of our drinking water, and their beauty attracts 100 million day visits annually. They offer refuge to threatened species, including the black grouse, ring ouzel, curlew, golden plover and twite. They preserve 75 per cent of the world's remaining heather moors. As climate change tops every agenda, too few are aware that its peat and blanket bogs store some 5 billion tonnes of carbon - the equivalent of more than 20 years of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions. If cared for, peatlands could absorb 41,000 tonnes of carbon a year. But if dried out, they will release 381,000 tonnes a year into the atmosphere or the water table. </p> <p>This landscape has been formed through centuries of management. Farmers like Wood are crucial, but he is not alone in feeling frustrated by the policy pendulum of recent years. Crookhill Farm, which he rents off the National Trust, is perched high in the idyllic Hope Valley, but he would have no hope of maintaining its 320 acres and 800 sheep without his son David, 32, who fits work on the farm around jobs as a contract shepherd, shearer and sheepdog handler. Battered by rising fuel and feed costs, Wood is forced to sell most of his stock as store lambs, as he cannot afford to fatten them, thereby handing over potential profits to lowland farmers with richer pasture. The bed-and-breakfast business run by his wife, Janet, provided pin money for holidays, as did his sideline as a sheepdog trainer. 'Now they are vital lifelines.'</p> <p>He must accumulate a requisite number of points to qualify for the higher end of the new environmental schemes, but like many is struggling to tick enough biodiversity boxes due to his farm's size and situation. He has his seven miles of drystone walls, but will they count? 'Drystone walls are a hugely important landscape feature, and we believe they are not being given anything like sufficient points weighting in recognition of the actual cost of maintaining them,' says Will Cockbain, an uplands officer for the National Farmers' Union.</p> <p>Changes to subsidies are said to have reduced their worth to moorland farmers by at least 70 per cent in the past 20 years, and there are fears that the new environment schemes will not make up the shortfall. 'Depopulation is the main danger,' says Maurice Retallick, 65, who farms 500 acres on Dartmoor. Today he has mainly cattle; he has cut the number of his ewes from 1,200 to 200, partly due to foot-and-mouth fears and also in keeping with environmental requirements.</p> <p>'We're all dyed-in-the-wool farmers round here and very loath to give up. But the next generation are thinking twice about it. I know of five or six young farming couples who have split up over the pressures. We lose farmers, we lose livestock. And once we start losing livestock, we start losing the uplands.'</p> <p>Hill farming is not the only concern. Wood's farm lies 15 miles from Sheffield off the A57 'Snake Pass' road which wends it way through the Peak District's moors towards Manchester. This year 1,000 acres of that moorland is blooming for the first time in living memory, thanks to Geoff Eyre, 63, an agriculturist and part-time hill farmer who has pioneered a revolutionary germination technique which has made him the world's expert in heather restoration. Part of the expense was covered through government schemes, and the rest came from private moor owners. Just a handful of birds were recorded on the land before the re-seeding five years ago. Today there are thousands.</p> <p>Eyre has his misgivings about the moors' future. One worry is over government policy to restrict heather burning. Grouse moor managers have always done this. It creates a mosaic of different lengths of heather needed for the wild red grouse, the game bird found only in Britain, and the sport of grouse shooting is worth \u00a312.5m to rural economies in England each year. Adrian Blackmore, moorland policy officer for the Countryside Alliance, said: 'If it wasn't for grouse, the well-managed moors that make up parts of the uplands as we know and love them would be a barren wilderness of grass and old heather supporting no wildlife.' Through burning and the control of predators such as foxes, stoats and crows, gamekeepers also provide for ground-nesting wading birds, he maintains. A recent survey by Natural England of 17 moorland sites of special scientific interest found that the RSPB's Geltsdale reserve in Cumbria had the lowest numbers of moorland birds compared with the keepered grouse moors surrounding it - due, Blackmore claims, to lack of predator control.</p> <p>The RSPB worries about bad burning, where the fire gets out of control and leads to erosion. The government now only allows burning under tight restrictions. But Eyre feels it has gone too far, and that overgrown heather and grass risk wildfires of Californian proportions. 'If we have an east wind, in 10 years' time here in the Peak District we are going to end up having to evacuate people out of Manchester because the moors are burning and smouldering away.'</p> <p>With so many agendas, bodies like the National Trust fear a 'chaotic and unplanned' evolution of the uplands. With public money difficult to get, private partnerships could be the way forward. Houseago believes water companies - which spend hundreds of millions a year cleansing water of pollution caused by erosion and farming methods - could invest in encouraging farmers to help provide cleaner, cheaper drinking water. He also sees potential in carbon offset markets. 'You can get your stocking rates right, stop eroding, stop draining, stop it drying out and oxidising into the atmosphere, hold water on bits of land, turn them into a store of carbon. Carbon markets could make millions.'</p> <p>Without such radical ideas there are fears farmers like Wood may be the last of their line. 'Who knows?' he shrugs. 'My lad lives and breathes the farm. He loves it. But can he afford to keep it on? That's a difficult one.'</p>",
  "<p>In a brightly painted room in Camberwell, south London, two 11-year-old girls are lying with their eyes closed, receiving a head massage. The expressions on their faces suggest they are about to drift happily off to sleep as Penny, the masseuse, continues her slow, rhythmic strokes. Perched on the end of the bed, nine-year-old Morgan and her friend are proudly showing me their newly painted fingernails - silver shooting stars drawn on little nails bitten down to the quick - and chatting about whether they prefer facials to manicures. </p> <p>While middle-class parents try to lure their pre-teen daughters away from nail polish and lipstick, fearing their little girls are growing up too fast, for some of these disadvantaged children the few hours they spend in the beauty therapy room at Kids Company's drop-in centre is a rare chance to be in a calm environment. It is also probably their only experience of being touched gently and lovingly or of being the focus of an adult's attention in a positive way. </p> <p>These children know all too well what it means to grow up too fast. The majority of the young people who knock on the door of the Kids Company centre asking for help do not have a functioning adult at home. Many of the parents are rendered incapable by drugs, some are abusing the children or permitting them to be abused in return for money or drugs. Some of the children appear in states of severe malnutrition and steal because they are starving. Most are not registered with doctors or dentists. </p> <p>From the excited faces of the younger children gathered here, you wouldn't guess that such bleakness framed their lives, a testament to the positive impact of Kids Company. It's also the last place you would expect to find the designer-clad figure of Kathy Phillips. Sylph-like in her tailored jacket and immaculate hair, Phillips is international beauty director of Vogue magazine. She's here to celebrate a most unlikely partnership: a range of aromatherapy products that she's created to raise money for the disadvantaged and damaged children who are helped by Kids Company. </p> <p>Kathy Phillips and Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder of Kids Company, make a wonderfully incongruous double act - Batmanghelidjh is a riot of colour in her turbans and flowing dresses - but their alliance will be invaluable to thousands of children. </p> <p>'The starting point was that Boots approached me about doing a mass-market range because they wanted something that was proper aromatherapy,' says Phillips, who already produces This Works, an award-winning range of aromatherapy products. 'I decided to call it Good Works, because it was going to be green and sustainable and because of the connection with This Works. Then I felt if we were going to use that name we really should be doing something good with it.' </p> <p>She could have chosen from any number of causes, but she had a friend who'd been working as a volunteer for Kids Company. 'I thought about what Camila was achieving here and I liked the fact that it was an unsexy cause,' she explains. 'People worry about donkey sanctuaries and children in Sri Lanka, when there are children here on their doorstep who need help.' </p> <p>Phillips initially didn't realise how well her idea would tie in with Kids Company's pioneering work in the use of massage therapies to treat disturbed children. First, she had to persuade Boots and the intermediary packaging and supply companies to take a hit in profits to fund the percentage given to charity - \u00a32 from every \u00a38 product, an unusually generous slice in the world of charity endorsements. So she didn't tell Batmanghelidjh of her plans until the infrastructure was almost complete, and it was only then she discovered the happy coincidence that massage was a central part of Kids Company's therapeutic programme. Now Batmanghelidjh takes over the story. </p> <p>'We'd have these boys lining up for massage, but some of them are so traumatised they won't allow anyone to touch them, so sometimes the therapist would have to do it over their Nike caps,' she says. She goes on to explain that all the complementary therapists who work at Kids Company (the centre offers massage, reflexology, cranial osteopathy and acupuncture, alongside psychotherapy) are supervised once a week by a psychotherapist. 'It's when the children are lying down that you see the cigarette burns, the belt marks. The massage therapists have to be prepared for this. And we tend to keep the appointments quite loose. If a child starts speaking or needs to fall asleep, we don't want to interrupt that. Many of them use it as an impromptu therapy session and for most of them it's their first experience of kind touch.' </p> <p>But raising money to pay for the therapeutic programme has proved difficult. Batmanghelidjh spends much of her time fundraising among City companies, many of which are generous, but occasionally she encounters prejudice. Every fresh newspaper story about a teenage knifing makes it that much more difficult to encourage firms to channel money in the direction of 'thugs'. Batmanghelidjh explains: 'One major organisation told me: \"Your kind of children don't look good on our annual report.\" And it's very hard to find funding for something like this programme, because it's not a building or an object that people can put a plaque on and say: \"We provided this.\" So when Kathy came along with this project I couldn't believe it.' </p> <p>Her struggle for funding is understandable; middle-market newspaper columnists would explode in indignation if government money were used to fund 'massages for muggers'. But those who would sneer at this project do so from an ignorance not just of the youngsters involved but also of the efficacy of complementary therapies, believe Phillips and Batmanghelidjh. </p> <p>'As a beauty editor you know that there's a percentage of people who think the whole thing's very superficial, very commercial, very empty-headed,' says Phillips, who is also a qualified yoga teacher. 'But further down the line you see how people are feeling better about themselves and how their performance has improved.' </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh is also aware of how the programme may be perceived by people who judge vulnerable children only by reports of their behaviour. To this end, Kids Company is collaborating on research with a number of university and medical schools into the effects of extreme neglect and abuse on the brain development of children. </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh shows me two MRI scans. In one of them there are large areas of empty space at the front of the skull. 'If no one interacts with you, the brain doesn't develop properly,' she says. 'So the brain of a three-year-old who has been severely neglected is smaller than the brain of a normal three-year-old. </p> <p>'The part of the brain that governs emotion and behaviour is underdeveloped, so these children can't calm themselves down. And they release vast amounts of adrenaline because they're terrified for long periods of time, so they're wired for emergency, they're like pressure cookers. They use cannabis to calm themselves, so we're looking at other ways of helping them do that. One of the most moving things is when you ask these boys: \"Do you feel calm when you hurt people?\", they'll say: \"My God, how did you know?\" Then you show them the brain pictures. I've had thugs cry - because for the first time someone has shown them what is happening to them and explained this thing that they've had no words for. So it's about equipping the children to take responsibility for balancing their energy and their emotions out, rather than just saying, \"Calm down.\"' </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh set up Kids Company in 1996 to combat the fallout from a system that was failing vulnerable children at an early age, leaving them prey to drug dealers and then blaming them when they ended up committing crimes. She estimates more than 500,000 young people ought to be on the Child Protection Register, 'and there is only capacity for 30,700. So at street level the drug dealers are perversely solving the social-care problems of these children. These are the things that we're not facing. We allow ourselves to describe children who present disturbed behaviour as \"young offenders\", then we can say: \"They made a poor moral choice.\" But if your brain chemistry is adapted for violence because of neglect or abuse, you don't have much of a choice. By labelling them criminals, we say the flawed morality is the child's and the rest of us get away with not facing our flawed morality in failing to help them. In my experience of working with these children for 11 years, none of them wants to be a criminal.' </p> <p>The good news, Batmanghelidjh continues, is that the damage to the developing brain can be repaired to a large extent by loving care, relationships of trust and the calming effects of the therapies. The results of the academic studies will be known in three years, and Batmanghelidjh hopes the science will change the way people view these vulnerable children and lend further support to her approach of 'robust love'. 'I want to be part of the solution rather than lock myself in a gated community and point from behind the bars saying, \"There goes the criminal!\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, the children tell me they can't wait to see the products on the shelves. 'They're really looking forward to going into Boots and seeing \"their\" products,' Batmanghelidjh says, beaming. 'It's a real source of pride that they can own this and feel that civil society is doing something to help them.' </p> <p>'I was surprised and very pleased about that,' adds Phillips, 'because I was afraid the children would feel patronised by the idea. But they've told Camila they'd really like their own spa.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Good Works will be available from Boots from September. Prices start at \u00a36</p>",

With 150 images on show, it's a comprehensive look through the portfolio of one of the most influential photographers working today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Annie Leibovitz: a Photographer's Life 1990-2005 is at the National Portrait Gallery, St Martin's Place, London WC2 (<a href=\"http://www.npg.org.uk\">www.npg.org.uk</a>) from 16 October to 1 February 2009 </p> <h2>B is for B Store</h2> <p>London's favourite independent menswear store opens a pop-up concession in Selfridges, Oxford Street, for one month this September. Established by Matthew Murphy and Kirk Beattie seven years ago, the Savile Row store has built a reputation for conceptual clothing, shoes and accessories from emerging designers. Ranges from five B Store regulars - including Bernard Willhelm, Siv Stodal and Tim Soar - will relocate to Selfridges' menswear department. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bstorelondon.com\">www.bstorelondon.com</a> </p> <h2>C is for <a href=\"http://cyclechic.co.uk\">cyclechic.co.uk</a></h2> <p>If you want to combine cycling with glamour, then visit this website - billed as the 'modern woman's guide to cycling'. It features tips on safety, buying bikes and, most importantly, fashion advice and an online shop of accessories for the stylish cyclist. 'Cycling can be an extremely graceful and ladylike mode of transport, but the public perception is often Lycra and chunky calves,' says Caz Nicklin, the blogger behind the site. Not if you buy cyclechic's range of cute bells, bags, lights and Bern helmets.</p> <h2>D is for Dunhill's flagship store</h2> <p>Dunhill's reinvention continues apace this autumn. The new collection - modelled in the ad campaign by a fey-looking Jude Law - is more desirable than ever, featuring merino wool sweaters, lambskin down-filled bomber jackets and sumptuous cashmere-mix suits. The perfect setting for this wardrobe is Mayfair's grand Bourden House, the new 'Home of Alfred Dunhill'. Once a residence of the Duke of Westminster, the three-floored, listed Georgian property now comprises a fashion and accessories emporium, spa and private members' club, replete with cinema and sleeping quarters - James Bond would surely approve.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Alfred Dunhill, Bourden House, 2 Davies Street, London W1 (020 7853 4444; <a href=\"http://www.dunhill.com\">www.dunhill.com</a>) opens 1 September </p> <h2>E is for Elie Tahari</h2> <p>Little known on these shores, designer Elie Tahari has been clothing chic American women since the Seventies. You'll see what all the fuss has been about when his (yes, Elie's a he) range goes on sale in both Harvey Nichols and Selfridges. Mixing perfectly cut body-con dresses with floaty chiffons and chunky knitted jackets, the label offers seriously covetable pieces which span the autumn/winter 2008/2009 trends without looking too try-hard.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Elie Tahari (<a href=\"http://www.elietahari.com\">www.elietahari.com</a>) is stocked at Harvey Nichols (020 7235 5000) and Selfridges (0800 123 400) </p> <h2>F is for Ferragamo hits 80</h2> <p>We have much to thank Italian shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo for. During the Second World War, when leather was in short supply, he experimented with cellophane, wood and cork, creating extraordinary footwear - inventing wedges and helping engineer the stiletto. The Ferragamo brand celebrates 80 years this autumn and marks the occasion with a shoe collection inspired by its impressive archive. On the clothes front, new designer Cristina Ortiz's first collection offers a mix of purple velvet trouser suits and floor-sweeping cocktail dresses in shiny silk satin. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> For stockists, call 020 7629 5007 </p> <h2>G is for Goth make-up</h2> <p>It's time to forget the nude summer style and start preparing yourself for the most startling make-up trend for years. This winter's dramatic dark lips and eyes are an excuse to indulge in some intense looks - for non-smudge eyes try Revlon's Colourstay eyeliner (\u00a37.99 at Boots), MAC's Loud Lash (\u00a310 at <a href=\"http://www.maccosmetics.co.uk\">www.maccosmetics.co.uk</a>) and Shu Uemura's metallic black and iridescent white eye shadows (\u00a313 each at <a href=\"http://www.spacenk.co.uk\">www.spacenk.co.uk</a>).</p> <h2>H is for hippy</h2> <p>Don't worry, not the tedious boho look donned by Sienna Miller and pals a few years back, but a sophisticated take on layering, textures and paisley. Yes, that's right: paisley. Last seen in abundance in 1992 in the form of garish shirts worn under dungarees during the rave era, this romantic fabric is infinitely more stylish this time round. Bally has designed a fine paisley jumpsuit (nicer than it sounds), while Gucci and Herm\u00e8s have also appropriated it with super-luxe results. Wear it with beaten leather boots and chunky woollens.</p> <h2>I is for Illustrated People</h2> <p>If you're looking for something different in the way of T-shirt design, check out the whimsical creations of Illustrated People. This east London label has a store in Brick Lane's Truman Brewery and is available online and at stockists across the UK. Its hand-printed designs include lions, skulls and slogans such as 'Lovelovelove'.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Illustrated People, 91 Brick Lane, The Truman Brewery, London E1 (020 7655 4974; <a href=\"http://www.illustratedpeople.com\">www.illustratedpeople.com</a>) </p> <h2>J is for Jigsaw accessories</h2> <p>It's been a bit of an insider secret for some time now, but the Jigsaw accessory shop on London's South Molton Street stocks the high street's most desirable handbags, wallets and belts. The good news is the range will be available at Jigsaw's online boutique from October.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Jigsaw Accessories, 49 South Molton Street, London W1 (020 7499 3385; <a href=\"http://www.jigsaw-online.com\">www.jigsaw-online.com</a>) </p> <h2>K is for knits</h2> <p>It's time to face the British winter and stock up on knitwear. This year's best buys include organic woollen sweaters at Bamford &amp; Sons (<a href=\"http://www.bamfordandsons.com\">www.bamfordandsons.com</a>) and knee-high socks at old-English gunmaker's Holland &amp; Holland (<a href=\"http://www.hollandandholland.com\">www.hollandandholland.com</a>) - brilliant under wellies. Old-school Danish label SNS Herning (<a href=\"http://www.sns-herning.com\">www.sns-herning.com</a>) has cool fisherman knits for men. You can also head to your local Gap in October when some glorious stripy jumpers for men and women land in store.</p> <h2>L s for lace</h2> <p>One of the most dreamy and delicate of fabrics, lace is a tricky thing to get right. While it looks stunning on the catwalk, or walking down the aisle, it can go a bit Ann Summers in everyday life. But it's a big trend this autumn, and various designers have succeeded in making the frothy fabric wearable. Prada's latest collection features jumbo-sized couture-made lace which feels simple and unfussy. Alternatively, Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci imbued the girly material with neo-gothic sensibilities for added weight. Finally, Luella's flouncy, layered minis with underskirts of lace are quite Eighties teen.</p> <h2>M is for Mulberry art bags</h2> <p>Ever since this British handbag brand hooked up with Luella Bartley in 2002, it's led the way in clever collaborations. This autumn Mulberry teams up with five artists from dynamic east London gallery Fred. They've designed tote bags to celebrate the 2008 Zoo Art Fair in October. The results are intriguing: artist Peter Jones's bag features a series of monkey images; Philip Jones has created monochromatic symbols from playing cards; and Paul Hoskings has produced a vivid tessellated design. The bags are a limited edition, and one contains a golden ticket. The lucky winner will receive the Fred artist's original artwork. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The exhibition of Fred artists is at Mulberry, 41-42 New Bond Street, London W1 (020 7491 3900; <a href=\"http://www.mulberry.com\">www.mulberry.com</a>) from 1 September to 22 October </p> <h2>N is for new names</h2> <p>Following the success of his last book, Modern Menswear, Hywel Davies has turned his attention to emerging talent. Featuring 100 of today's brightest fashion designers - from Ashish to Meadham/Kirchhoff - he captures their work in a colourful book which includes photos, design sketches and interviews.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> 100 New Fashion Designers is published in September by Laurence King Press at \u00a324.95. Films on the featured designers are at <a href=\"http://www.SHOWstudio.com\">www.SHOWstudio.com</a> now </p> <h2>O is for opulence</h2> <p>To counteract the sober shades and stark shapes flooding the shops this autumn, a clutch of hedonistic designers have opted for luxury. Shimmer was big at Christian Lacroix, who scattered giant sequins on structured golden coats. Christopher Kane also explored the sequin theme, threading jumbo plastic discs on to diaphanous dresses and heels, while Prada embellished silky dresses and bomber jackets with dazzling jewels for the cruise collection. The award for most lavish show has to go to Alexander McQueen, however, who produced one of his most spectacularly opulent collections ever - taking regal themes such as sumptuous silk gowns and embossed velvet jackets in imperial red to the catwalks with dazzling effect. </p> <h2>P is for Patricia Field for Marks &amp; Spencer</h2> <p>In one of the most unexpected collaborations in recent times, Patricia Field, the New York stylist behind Carrie Bradshaw's Sex and the City wardrobe, has hooked up with M&amp;S for a one-off collection. 'It embodies the splashy and exuberant lifestyle that I have consistently created in my work with superstars,' gushes Field. The collection will be made from high-quality silks, metallics and satins, with bright prints including stars, stripes and polka dots. The dresses are key - look out for the deep turquoise shift with flowing chiffon sleeves and the corseted halterneck frock.</p> <h2>Q is for quirky</h2> <p>Time to relish Britain's heritage of fine tweeds, posh quaintness and country style: good old English eccentricity is back in fashion. Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood are stalwarts of the style, and the Paul Smith catwalk show proved there's nothing wrong with a Princess Margaret-style silk headscarf, especially when worn with heavily kohled eyes, high heels and a swagger.</p> <h2>R is for red</h2> <p>Though the a/w 2008/09 catwalks were awash with black, vibrant flashes of red provided sharp relief from the gloom. Red cropped up at Valentino, Giambattista Valli - in the form of a divine poppy-bright cocktail dress with an exquisite floral flourish at the back - and Marchesa, who designed Coleen Rooney's wedding dress, to name but a few. If you're scared to wear it top to toe, try a flash of cherry-red lipstick (as seen at Viktor &amp; Rolf's show). As ever, Chanel does the best: go for Rouge Hydrabase Creme Lipstick in number 104 - Inspiration. </p> <h2>S is for sheepskin boots</h2> <p>Bored of Uggs but still like the idea of sloping about in some comfy animal skin boots? Then check out the new range by Mou which includes some delectable cow, goat and sheepskin styles, all ethically sourced. A favourite is the calf-height, moccasin-style boot known as the Eskimo, \u00a399. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Available at <a href=\"http://www.mou-online.com\">www.mou-online.com</a> </p> <h2>T is for Topman by Anthony Price</h2> <p>Veteran designer Anthony Price has been commissioned to create a collection for Topman - and what a contrast his Priceless range is to the ritzy cocktail frocks that made his womenswear famous in the Seventies. This men's range features super-slim tailored suits, drummer-boy coats and luxurious ponyskin coats - it's sharp, sleek and ultra-minimal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Available at Topshop's Oxford Circus flagship store and online from the beginning of November (0845 121 4519; <a href=\"http://www.topman.com\">www.topman.com</a>) </p> <h2>U is for ultra modern</h2> <p>Revered fashion house Balenciaga has always balanced the history of the label with moving ideas and designs forward, but this season designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re has created an exceptional, super-slick and modernist collection featuring oxblood and a fluid black latex as well as plastics worked into space-age coats and moulded dresses. Ghesqui\u00e8re's austere look heralds a new era of structured minimalism which was also picked up by other futuristic designers, such as Stefano Pilati at Yves Saint Laurent, Todd Lynn and Alessandro Dell'Acqua. </p> <h2>V is for the V&amp;A's Magnificence of the Tsars</h2> <p>You can always rely on the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum for an extravagant winter show. This December, it's a look at Imperial Russia when costumes and uniforms worn by Tsars and court officials arrive in South Kensington. On loan from the Moscow Kremlin Museums - which are simultaneously showing a collection of the V&amp;A's 18th-century British clothing - the collection spans almost 200 years of fashion history. There are some spectacularly detailed pieces, such as a dress costume worn by Nicholas II to the Russian Ball of 1903. A great opportunity to see some of the most exquisite textiles in the world from embellished silks to complex embroideries. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The Magnificence of the Tsars runs from 10 December to 2 March 2009 (020 7942 2000; <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk\">www.vam.ac.uk</a>) </p> <h2>W is for winter coats</h2> <p>One of the most important winter purchases is a quality coat. This autumn go for a structured coat (there are tons to choose from), a classic look which could last you for years to come - if not a lifetime. The best can be found at Aquascutum, Burberry Prorsum, Maxmara and Valentino. Also look at <a href=\"http://www.matchesfashion.com\">www.matchesfashion.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com\">www.net-a-porter.com</a> for a fine selection of desirable outerwear. If you're on a budget, head to Whistles (<a href=\"http://www.whistles.co.uk\">www.whistles.co.uk</a>), now under the magical new direction of ex-Topshop supremo Jane Shepherdson. The Majorette pea coat is excellent value at \u00a3195. And if your budget is a little tighter, head for H&amp;M.</p> <h2>X is for x-rated boots</h2> <p>Welcome back the spiky heeled dominatrix boot this season - as seen at Rick Owens, Fendi and Jonathan Kelsey. The rules are these: 1) they should reach the knee but not stretch too far up the thigh; 2) they should be worn with something demure like a belted jersey dress and granny tights to prevent them looking too red-light district; 3) buy in softest suede or quality leather - PVC sends all the wrong messages. You have been warned...</p> <h2>Y is for young blood</h2> <p>Currently headed by Louise Goldin, Danielle Scutt and Louise Gray, the troop of talented female designers showing in London gains force each year. This season there are three new names to look out for: Mary Katrantzou, Natascha Stolle and Simone Shailes. Katrantzou is fast making a name for herself with prints on silk and statement jewellery. Stolle debuts at Fashion East this September with sexy but grown-up womenswear. Shailes, meanwhile, is being heralded as the next big thing in knitwear thanks to her armour-like knitted jackets.</p> <h2>Z is for Zaha Hadid</h2> <p>Revered architect Hadid makes a splash in fashion this year. She's collaborated with Melissa (<a href=\"http://www.melissaplasticdreams.com\">www.melissaplasticdreams.com</a>), a Brazilian firm specialising in plastic shoes, to make footwear as complex and curvaceous as her buildings. They bear little resemblance to footwear, but we hear they're the ultimate in comfort. Hadid has also designed a 'mobile art container' (a pop-up gallery) for Chanel. The structure houses a touring art show inspired by its classic quilted bag. You can see it in New York this October and in London next year.</p>",
  "<p>The courts have lambasted trade unions for misleading their low-paid women members and settling their equal pay claims for too little in recent landmark judgments.</p> <p>As many as 150,000 women, according to estimates from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), are entitled to compensation from local authorities and the NHS for being paid less than male colleagues, in litigation that now threatens to bring tribunals to 'a grinding halt'.</p> <p>The Court of Appeal recently upheld an employment tribunal's finding that the GMB trade union 'rushed headlong' into an 'ill-considered back-pay deal' in the case of Allen v GMB and 'accepted too readily the council's plea of poverty'. Appeal judges agreed that the GMB had indirectly discriminated against 26 female workers paid less than their male counterparts when agreeing backdated pay deals following the 1997 'single status' agreement between unions and local authorities designed to eliminate pay disparities. </p> <p>Lord Justice Maurice Kay, quoting the earlier tribunal ruling, said that the GMB 'failed to give the claimants a fully informed choice about the options', and that claimants were not told that what they were being offered was 'substantially less than they might receive following successful litigation'.</p> <p>The women were represented by the Newcastle-based 'no win, no fee' lawyer Stefan Cross, who claims to be acting for 40,000 women. He has been accused by the GMB of 'tearing up industrial relations' and undermining collective negotiation through his firm's targeting of women cleaners, care workers and kitchen staff -often union members - and pursuing individual cases through the courts. </p> <p>The judge also said that there 'had been not only a failure to provide full information, but also positive manipulation' of, in the words of an earlier tribunal ruling, 'relatively unsophisticated claimants'.</p> <p>'I have been paying my subs to the GMB for 11 years and the first and only time I have gone to them was over my equal pay claims,' says Sheila Allen, a 57-year-old care worker who has worked for Middlesbrough Council for 19 years and whose claim is the test case. 'What I found out was that we counted for nothing.' </p> <p>However, GMB national secretary Brian Strutton argues that the recent ruling - along with a second, separate Appeal Court judgment that Redcar and Cleveland council's pay protection scheme had been unlawful because it, in effect, perpetuated inequality - will now 'lead to the conclusion that women need to pursue equal pay cases through litigation based upon individual complaints going through the courts. But the courts can't cope with it.'</p> <p>The tribunal system 'has complained bitterly' about bearing the brunt of some 44,000 equal pay claims, he says, and points to a 155 per cent increase last year alone. </p> <p>The EHRC has argued that equal pay cases should be kept out of the courts and dealt with through negotiated settlements. </p> <p>Ms Allen is one of 26 women who are claiming that they were paid less than male colleagues in their work as cleaners, care workers and other low-salary jobs. Middlesbrough Council disputes this and denies the women have any claim at all. Only one has received any money. </p> <p>'It is important to ensure that each individual claim is dealt with fairly and in accordance with the law, which is still being formulated,' a council spokesman says, adding that it would be 'inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage'. </p> <p>In 2004 home carers like Ms Allen (a female-dominated occupation) were on \u00a35.88 an hour whereas a gardener on the same grade (a male-dominated occupation) was on \u00a38.23 due to a 40 per cent bonus. She is reluctant to put a figure on what level of compensation she might be entitled to: 'I've known people take out loans on the strength of the money - and they're still waiting.' </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, she feels bitterly let down by the perceived inaction of her union, the GMB. It is a sentiment echoed by Bobbie (Roberta) Dalton, a 66-year-old care worker and former Unison rep. 'For the last three decades the unions have been telling their members how they are going to fight for equal-pay workers and nothing happened,' she says. She reckons that she was being paid \u00a315,000 a year - whereas her male equivalents could be paid anywhere between \u00a315,000 and \u00a320,000. She believes her compensation could be more than \u00a320,000.</p> <p>Both women are being represented by Cross, who takes a 25 per cent cut of any payout. He is described by Dalton as 'the light at the end of the tunnel for working-class women who have tried for 30 years to get the unions to move on equal pay.</p> <p>'Middlesbrough Council reckon they are an equal opportunities employer - let them live up to the words they have put in print,' she says.</p>",
  "<p>Homebuyers and anyone remortgaging with a decent deposit got a welcome boost last week as a price-cutting war broke out among lenders. First-time buyers will still struggle to get near the best rates but, if you have the capital, there are incentives to act now. </p> <p>Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the lending arm of Lloyds TSB, opened hostilities on Monday by launching a range of mortgages with a complicated array of rates and fees. Anyone with a 40 per cent deposit to put down on their chosen property who can also afford the \u00a32,094 fee can now get a two-year fixed rate from C&amp;G at 5.65 per cent. This is substantially lower than the best rates in the market two months ago and one of the best deals on offer for those with enough money to qualify. The lender will cut the fee to \u00a31,094 for anyone opting for a 5.75 per cent rate.</p> <p>'Some daylight has opened up for homeowners in the last few weeks and there is now a much bigger margin between the cheapest rates and lenders' standard variable rates [the rate you revert to if you don't remortgage], so those who were thinking of waiting will now want to re-look at remortgaging,' says David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London &amp; Country.</p> <p>Following C&amp;G's lead, Abbey then cut its rates by up to 0.25 per cent. For someone with 30 per cent equity in their home, a two-year fix has fallen to 5.89 per cent with a \u00a3995 fee, while 25 per cent equity will secure 5.99 per cent with a \u00a3995 fee. Homebuyers with a 25 per cent deposit can get a two-year fix for 5.99 per cent and a three-year fix for 5.94 per cent. </p> <p>The big-name lenders - Halifax, C&amp;G, Abbey, Nationwide and the Woolwich - are the ones fuelling the rate-cut war, according to Hollingworth, but many of the smaller lenders are following suit. The Yorkshire building society raised the ante last Wednesday by relaunching a range of two-year fixes that look appealing for anyone with a 25 per cent deposit or 25 per cent equity in their home. Its rate now stands at 5.54 per cent with an \u00a3895 fee. It also offers a 4.89 per cent, two-year fixed rate for anyone who is willing to pay a fee of 2.5 per cent of their loan.</p> <p>The Newcastle building society is one of those lenders that is strong across the board on fixed rates, offering a five-year fix at 5.6 per cent for someone with a 25 per cent deposit. The same person could secure a two-year fix with Market Harborough building society for 5.75 per cent with a \u00a3690 fee. </p> <p>The C&amp;G rates also remain attractive for those with a 25 per cent deposit at 5.75 or 5.84 per cent, depending on the fee. However, the rate shoots up to 6.25 per cent for those with just 10 per cent to put down. The fee for those buyers is \u00a31,094. </p> <p>'There is a lot of jostling going on between lenders at the moment trying to outdo each other's rates. But this is concentrated on the lower-risk end of the market,' says Hollingworth. 'The drop in rates will filter down to first-time buyers, but they will not get the best deals.' Anyone looking to buy with less than a 10 per cent deposit will still have very little choice of where to borrow. </p> <p>Direct Line and Royal Bank of Scotland are among the few lenders that will still lend up to 95 per cent of the value of a property, but the rates start at an eye-watering 6.89 per cent for a two-year fixed rate. Both lenders also charge a higher lending fee on top of their other mortgage fees. According to Melanie Bien of mortgage brokers Savills Private Finance, such charges - which help to cushion lenders against potential losses if you default on the mortgage and they have to sell your home at a loss - are 'creeping back in'. </p> <p>'Even at 90 per cent, the number of loans are limited and you will have to pay a premium on the rate,' says Bien. </p> <p>'First-time buyers will increasingly have to return to old-fashioned values and save up for a deposit. Unlike in the past, where the danger of saving was that you would be priced further off the housing ladder, the situation has changed; with prices falling, you could argue that there is more reason than ever to hold off to ensure you don't pay more than you need to.'</p> <p>For buyers with a 10 per cent deposit, she points to Yorkshire building society, which is offering 6.09 per cent fixed for a choice of two, three or five years, with a \u00a3995 fee.</p> <p>Hollingworth recommends Nationwide's mortgages for those with a 10 per cent deposit, though its remortgage rates are better than its rates for new buyers. For purchases, its two-year fixed rate from Thursday is at 6.53 per cent with a \u00a3599 fee, while for remortgages the same mortgage is 6.33 per cent. Nationwide also has a two-year tracker rate at 1.13 per cent over Bank base rate, giving a rate of 6.13 per cent. There is a \u00a31,499 fee.</p> <p>Bien points to Lloyds TSB's lifetime tracker at 1.35 per cent over Bank base rate for the term, giving a current rate of 6.35 per cent, with a \u00a3995 fee, while Hollingworth mentions HSBC's lifetime tracker of 0.99 per cent over base rate, which requires no fee. </p> <p>Hollingworth warns that while it is good news that rates have begun to come down - with the possibility of further to go - those who are coming up to remortgage shouldn't be complacent. 'The danger is that people become indecisive in this market as they wait and see what happens with rates,' he says. 'Homeowners shouldn't forget that it was only in June that rates suddenly spiked by half a per cent, which shows how volatile the current market is.'</p> <p>Householders should also double-check their lenders' policies on fees. Many now charge part of the total application fee up front - typically between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 - but some ask for all of it. This is unlikely to be refunded if borrowers spot a better deal during the application process, even if that deal is with the same lender. Some lenders will even ask for the rest of the fee, which can be up to \u00a32,000, to be paid if the application process falls through.</p>",
  "<p>Iceland chief executive Malcolm Walker is expected to renew his overtures to the Woolworths board this week in a meeting with chairman Richard North.</p> <p>Walker, who has the support of Woolworths' largest shareholder, Baugur, has offered to buy the retailer's 819 stores for an estimated \u00a350m. The board rejected the indicative offer because it undervalued the stores, but also because of its onerous conditions: the bidders do not want to take on the majority of Woolworths' debt or pension liabilities.</p> <p>The approach was made in July but not made public until this week. However, Walker is thought to be keen to resume talks, with insiders describing the proposal as an 'opening shot'. The consortium does not want its supply businesses, EUK and 2 Entertain, but would run Woolworths as a going concern.</p> <p>Market reaction to a deal has been muted with the shares closing the week at just 7p, reflecting the complexity of restructuring the group. The shares have fallen 70 per cent in the past year, after a poor Christmas and lacklustre first half.</p> <p>North ousted chief executive Trevor Bish-Jones in June, and has hired former Focus DIY chief executive Steve Johnson to replace him. If Walker were to win control it would cap a dramatic rehabilitation for the entrepreneur, who founded Iceland but was forced out in a share-dealing row. He later bought it back with Baugur and has since led an impressive turnaround, with profits up nearly 40 per cent to \u00a3130m in the year to March 2008.</p>",

  "<p>An 'epidemic of poverty' in Britain is having a dramatic impact on the survival rates and health chances of children from poor families, an influential coalition will warn this week in a major report that casts doubt on government efforts to close the inequality gap. </p> <p>End Child Poverty, a 130-strong network of children's charities, church groups, unions and think-tanks, claims that the gap between rich and poor represents a 'huge injustice' in British society and has become one of the major factors affecting child mortality rates. </p> <p>Its report, based on a wide-ranging analysis of government data, finds that children from poor families are at 10 times the risk of sudden infant death as children from better-off homes. And it reveals how babies from disadvantaged families are more likely to be born underweight - an average of 200 grams less than children from the richest families. Poorer children are two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer chronic illness when toddlers and twice as likely to have cerebral palsy, according to the report, 'Health Consequences of Poverty for Children'.</p> <p>'Poverty is now one of the greatest dangers faced by our children,' said Nick Spencer, one of the report's authors and professor of child health at the University of Warwick. 'If poverty were an infection, we would be in the midst of a full-scale epidemic.'</p> <p>The report is likely to revive the debate on child poverty and focus attention on Labour's record when it comes to tackling social inequalities. In March 1999, the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, promised to eradicate child poverty 'within a generation'. This was later defined as a commitment to end child poverty by 2020, with a target of halving the number of children living in poverty by 2010/11.</p> <p>But last week the Conservatives attacked the government on its record for narrowing the gap between rich and poor. 'Labour has failed, it has created a more unfair society and I think there is a real opportunity for the Conservative party now to lead this debate,' the shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, said.</p> <p>But while the current row over social inequality has tended to focus on education and benefits, the implications for health have been largely ignored. Now, however, the End Child Poverty report highlights how socio-economic factors affect the entire life of children born into poverty, from foetal development and early infancy through to teenage years and adulthood.</p> <p>It found that children living in disadvantaged families are more than three times as likely to suffer from mental health disorders as those in well-off families and that infants under three years old in families with an annual income of less than \u00a310,400 are twice as likely to suffer from asthma as those from families earning over \u00a352,000. </p> <p>The report also suggests the health consequences of being born into poverty continue well beyond infancy. For example, adults who came from deprived families were found to be 50 per cent more likely to have serious and limiting illnesses, such as type two diabetes and heart failure.</p> <p>'From the day they are born, children's health and very survival are threatened by family poverty,' said Donald Hirsch, co-author of the report and policy adviser to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. </p> <p>'It is one of society's greatest inequalities that poor health is so dramatically linked to poverty. Children in the poorest UK families are at least twice as likely to die unexpectedly before their first birthdays than children in slightly better-off families. This is a huge injustice for the children in one of the richest nations in the world.'</p> <p>The government claims it is closing the gap between rich and poor, but accepts that more needs to be done. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, said in June: 'Although we have already lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty with new tax credits, more people in work and better public services, the latest figures show we have not made enough progress.'</p> <p>He added: 'We will not deny or explain away the figures. We will take them as a spur to action, a call to conscience.'</p> <p>The government recently announced the introduction of 10 pilot projects to tackle ill health among people from poor backgrounds, including rewarding parents for making sure their children attend health check-ups and receive inoculations.</p> <p>But Hilary Fisher, director of the Campaign to End Child Poverty, said the new report showed that there was an urgent need for more robust measures to address the health consequences of economic deprivation. 'This evidence has profound implications for public policy,' Fisher said. 'The facts prove that effective action to end child poverty would make a vital long-term contribution to improving the health of our nation and prevent avoidable incidences of physical and mental ill health. </p> <p>'The government made a bold promise to halve child poverty by 2010 and this now requires bold action.'</p>",
  "<p>Is Gary Glitter to be considered a monster? Is he deluded? Or is he damaged? If he is a monster, immune to the feelings of his victims, he is dangerous and in need of strict management. If he is deluded, he is in need of psychological treatment. If he is damaged, treating his behaviour as a laughing matter and enjoying his notoriety, he needs help with what is probably a profound sense of inadequacy and emptiness. </p> <p>The media want him to be only a monster, but the chances are that he is all three: monstrous, deluded and damaged. One of the differences between the mad and the bad is that madness can be thought of as an illness located in another's mind. Badness disturbs us emotionally because it happens out in the world, enacted between the bad person and their victim. </p> <p>Because perverse, violent, delinquent and criminal activity has this disturbing impact, it is difficult to think about it dispassionately. But unless we can, we are in danger of reacting in a punitive and controlling way, mirroring the perpetrator. Sometimes the most appropriate response to bad behaviour is punishment, control and containment, but at other times, there is a possibility of understanding why that which most of us consider unacceptable becomes, for some people, central to their being. </p> <p>An abusive patient once said that 'a hurting body is easier than a hurting mind', meaning that the pain he caused others and others caused him was preferable to acknowledging the pain, rage, fear and humiliation he would otherwise need to confront within himself. </p> <p>The perverse and violent act locates these emotions outside of the self by displacing them into the body and/or arousing it in the other person. Sex and sexuality are hijacked for the purposes of violation, humiliation and control. As one writer puts it, perverse acts are erotic forms of hatred. </p> <p>Perhaps the most difficult form of this to consider is the sexual abuse of children. A person suffering from paedophilia believes that a child is an appropriate sexual partner. For this to be the case, there has clearly been some profound disturbance in the process of emotional development. The paedophile may be behaving in a manner with which he is emotionally familiar, but inevitably the abused child's nascent sexual and emotional development is severely damaged. </p> <p>Can we consider whether, unconsciously, this is part of the paedophile's drive to locate the damage to his own development in the experience of the child he abuses? Can we also consider whether the paedophile's behaviour is a distorted expression of his unmet childhood need for appropriate physical contact and his confusion about the differences between childhood physicality and adult sexuality?</p> <p>Normal emotional development involves a struggle between the wish for intimacy and the desire for autonomy. If this goes wrong, closeness comes to feel engulfing and autonomy as abandonment. In an attempt to overcome these two anxieties, the offender looks to dominate another so as to be in control of closeness and autonomy, and a child may become the 'easy' target of this perverse solution.</p> <p>It is essential to hold in mind both the victim and perpetrator aspects of the patient - to neither collude with the first nor to demonise and condemn the latter. This requires the development of a sophisticated relationship between social means of control - the criminal justice system - and those of care - the mental health services. </p> <p>Achieving a balance between care and control is what good families try to do. It is what communities and our professional and political leaders need to do, too - to create social structures and systems that take care of, sometimes very robustly, all citizens, even those whose actions are extremely difficult to comprehend and think about. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stanley Ruszczynski is a consultant adult psychotherapist and clinical director of the Portman Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, London</p>",
  "<p><strong>Light the barbecue before the guests arrive</strong></p> <p>Even have some grilling under way - maybe just a few bites. At the very least, your guests will arrive to the tantalising smell of the debris burning off the barbecue grills. </p> <p><strong>Be <em>en</em> place</strong></p> <p>The chef's term for having everything in place ready to go. Get marinating the day before and prepare everything to as advanced a state as you can. This will leave you with less washing-up and more time to set up drinks and create the party atmosphere on the day. </p> <p><strong>Be organised around your barbecue</strong></p> <p>Have enough work surface. Work out how many grill-loads of food you have to cook. What other equipment will you need? How will you keep raw meat separate from cooked?</p> <p><strong>Stay with your barbecue</strong></p> <p>Stay for as long as you are grilling, for the best results and for safety's sake. You won't get lonely. Chefs never do. There are always a handful of - invariably male - guests who huddle around giving their chefs advice. Barbecuing is theatre. </p> <p><strong>Use great basic ingredients</strong></p> <p>The summer months, when most barbecue bones are tickled, coincide perfectly with the season of fruit and vegetable gluts, leaving you spoilt for great ingredients both to barbecue (sweet corn, courgettes, plums, apples, etc) and to throw together into great salads to accompany your grilled meats, birds and fish. You should always wash vegetables before use, particularly if you aren't peeling them.</p> <p><strong>Season</strong></p> <p>Seasoning is often neglected. This is one of the first lessons any chef learns. Only add salt to a marinade if you are marinating for no more than 2 hours. Pepper is fine overnight, but salt never. Always season with salt just before barbecuing and don't be afraid to season well. Flaked sea salt, such as Maldon, will just fall off through the barbecue grill. Either blitz Maldon in your spice grinder, or use fine sea salt.</p> <p><strong>Lose fridge chill</strong></p> <p>Always give enough time out of the fridge, at least 20 minutes, for raw barbecue dishes to lose their chill and to be approaching room temperature. If the meat, chicken, fish or vegetable is too cold in the centre, the outside may well burn before the inside is cooked. </p> <p><strong>Temperature control during grilling</strong></p> <p>Control the proximity of the food to the coals. If you can, use a rack system with three different heights and moveable grills and hinged sandwich racks. If not, shuffle your grilling food around from hot patches to cooler parts of the rack, or place the food on foil to slow things down.</p> <p><strong>Test for 'doneness'</strong></p> <p>Using a small sharp knife, cut into the centre of the meat (down to the bone if there is one), to check that the flesh is cooked and juices are running clear. For flaky fish, such as salmon, press the flesh with your finger or a fork to check that the flakes come apart, indicating that it is ready. </p> <p><strong>Rest the meat</strong></p> <p>Resting meats after barbecuing is as essential a part of the barbecuing process as any other. If you were to eat a steak directly off the barbecue, it would be tough and juices would flow out the moment you prodded it with your steak knife. Leaving it to rest for a few minutes allows the meat sinews to reabsorb the juices. Rest the meat on a warmed tray on the top rack or away from the direct heat covered with perforated foil.</p> <h2>Magnificent marinating</h2> <p>If you have a fantastic piece of well-hung organic beef from a farm down the road, then maybe just brush it lightly with a little oil, season it with some sea salt and freshly ground black pepper and barbecue it over the coals as is, serving it with any of our sauces. Otherwise, if you have just bought a piece of meat, some chicken, fish or vegetables from the shop, marinating is essential.</p> <p>Marinades don't only flavour meat, but they also tenderise. Overnight marinating gives the best flavour but some more delicate fish and shellfish will not benefit from overnight marinating - and never use salt, or lemon and lime juices in a marinade for longer than two hours. Avoid pineapple juice, as it is very destructive, breaking down meat and fish fibres totally. Don't hesitate to bring out any flavour more strongly by adding an extra teaspoon or so of a seasoning. </p> <p>If you don't have some of the ingredients, check your shelves and fridge to see what you might use as a substitute. This is how great recipes are created.</p> <p><strong>Five top tips for marinating</strong></p> <p>Marinate overnight whenever possible for maximum flavour (unless stated otherwise in the recipe).</p> <p>Extra virgin olive oil is great, but you should never use it in marinades. It burns and smokes on contact with the barbecue. Use light olive oil, or vegetable oil instead and save the extra virgin bottles for your salads and sauces.</p> <p>Marinate in strong plastic bags, tied securely to prevent leakage when you turn them. Otherwise, always cover food tightly with clingfilm and use non-reactive containers such as glass, or stainless steel.</p> <p>Before placing on the barbecue grill, rub or shake off any excess marinade, particularly if there is any oil in it, to prevent burning or flaring and the consequent smoky bitter flavour.</p> <p>Never put cooked meat back onto the same dish you used for marinating. Always use a clean serving dish or plate.</p> <h2>All set? Good, then you're ready to turn up the heat ...</h2> <p>To light the fire without resorting to firelighters, scrunch up three or four double pages of newspaper and place in the barbecue trough under a good handful of kindling. Place a few chunks of charcoal on top and light the paper. When you have a flame from the wood, sprinkle charcoal on the top in a pile like a bonfire. </p> <p>Let this burn for 15-20 minutes with your barbecue rack above it. You are ready to grill when smoking has abated and the embers are glowing. Good-quality charcoal will last up to an hour.</p> <p>The temperature and grill times are just guidelines. Grill times are dependent on factors including weather conditions, the age, type and dampness of charcoal and the core temperature of the food. </p> <p>Once the charcoal has been burning for 20 minutes or so and is smoke-free and glowing, hold your hand directly over the grill bars and consult the table (left). If the temperature does not fall exactly into one of these categories, but is good and hot nevertheless, rake the coals around a little, but don't waste too much time trying to adjust it; just alter the grill time accordingly and test whether it is done as described above.</p> <h2>Testing the temperature</h2> <p><strong>Temperature terminology</strong></p> <p>Slow or 'holding': Indefinitely, but warm <br>Medium or 'cook': 6-7 seconds<br>Medium-high or 'sizzle': 3-4 seconds<br>High or 'searing': 1 second</p>",
  "<p>If you are still with the same broadband provider you signed up to a year or more ago, now could be the ideal time to switch. </p> <p>A recent report from telecoms regulator Ofcom showed that the number of people signing up for broadband internet in the last two years has been falling. As a result, specialists now expect broadband providers to fix their sights firmly on people already online with a rival company rather than on new customers. </p> <p>This is good news for those feeling a squeeze on their finances: because the price of the average broadband deal has dropped by 4 per cent over the past four years, there are already savings to be made. And with broadband providers keener than ever to keep your business, you might even be able to negotiate a better deal with your existing provider rather than move away. </p> <p>But if you are going to move, with dozens of providers now in the market, how do you pick the right one? </p> <p><strong>Light, medium or heavy?</strong></p> <p>'The first thing anyone looking at broadband packages needs to understand is what sort of user they are,' says James Parker, broadband specialist at Moneysupermarket.com. </p> <p>With a plethora of social networking sites, video, audio and other interactive services exploding onto the web, the chances are you may be a different sort of internet user than you used to be. The Ofcom report shows that the average person in Britain spends 24 minutes a day online when at home, up from six minutes in 2002. And it is not just the amount of time that people are online which has changed, but the amount of material they are downloading. The launch of the BBC's iPlayer in July last year has changed the face of internet use in this respect. Experts predict the service, which allows users to download BBC TV programmes over the internet for free, could soon account for 10 per cent of all UK traffic - and could add hefty amounts to broadband bills for those not on the right package.</p> <p>In simple terms, you are a 'light user' if you use your connection only to surf the web and send emails. A 'medium user' will use the internet daily for surfing and email and occasionally download music or video clips, while a 'heavy user' will use the internet for five or more hours each day and download extensively.</p> <p>Light-user packages are cheaper but come with restrictions on how much you can download a month. To give you an idea of usage, a package that comes with a 1GB limit will allow you to surf the web for four hours a day, and over the course of a week will allow you to send 15 emails with picture attachments, or 100 emails without, download 10 music tracks, and listen to two hours of online radio.</p> <p>According to Andrew Ferguson of website <a href=\"http://www.Thinkbroadband.com\">Thinkbroadband.com</a>, the average broadband user uses 6 or 7GB a month, so make sure you're not underestimating your usage. Some providers impose steep penalties for exceeding the limits. Others are more lenient and will allow you to pay as you go to increase it. </p> <p><strong>Price, service and speed</strong></p> <p>'The number-one aspect people will look for is still price,' says Parker. 'You can now get really good products for \u00a310 a month.'</p> <p>But while it is tempting to concentrate solely on the figures, increasingly experts are advising customers that it is worth sacrificing a couple of pounds a month for better customer service. The Cash inbox frequently receives emails from readers who are frustrated with their broadband provider, often because they cannot get connected or have lost a connection and then can't get anyone at the company to answer the phone. 'As a rule of thumb, the larger the company providing the broadband, the more customer service suffers,' says Parker.</p> <p>It is an invaluable investment of time to spend an half an hour or so searching the various forums where broadband users have given their feedback on their provider. Thinkbroadband.com tends to be used by the 'techie' crowd and therefore has an enormous forum where users discuss customer service as well as technical problems. Price comparison websites <a href=\"http://www.uSwitch.com\">uSwitch.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Moneysupermarket.com\">Moneysupermarket.com</a> both provide an option to rank providers on their service, based on user feedback. Moneysupermarket users rank O2 and Plusnet at the top, while uSwitch users go for Plusnet and Sky. </p> <p>Most providers will offer a range of packages offering different download speeds at different prices. O2, for example, has three packages at 8, 16 and 20Mb. Its 8Mb package is \u00a37.50 a month for O2 customers and \u00a312.50 for everyone else. James Parker of Moneysupermarket.com says that if you are a light user, speed should not be an overriding concern and a package offering up to 2Mb should be fine. However, if you are a heavy user you might want to focus more on it, as long as you are aware that the top speed advertised is not always what you will achieve. So an 'up to 8Mb' package might in reality give you a speed of nearer 3Mb depending on a number of factors such as your distance from the exchange and the quality of your wiring. </p> <p>One aspect of broadband that has developed rapidly in recent years and makes it more difficult to choose is the bundled package. These are where a provider offers broadband and phone or broadband, phone, TV and sometimes a mobile phone service for one monthly fixed price. </p> <p>It can be very confusing to work out what's good value, but all our experts (see below) suggested that existing Sky customers would benefit from signing up to the company's broadband offering. The basic package is free if you already have Sky TV and most of our commentators ranked the company's customer service quite highly. But if you have, and want to stick with, Freeview, for example, then you still might benefit from a broadband/phone deal. These often give you free weekend and evening calls and line rental is sometimes discounted from BT's monthly price. </p> <p>When you are considering price, you also need to consider flexibility. Most broadband packages are for 12-18 months and not all are portable if you move house. Plenty of companies now offer one-month rolling contracts, which cost a bit more but are worth considering if you need the flexibility. </p> <p><strong>Mobile broadband</strong></p> <p>This new development allows you to have an internet connection without the need for a fixed-line phone, saving you the \u00a311 a month or so for line rental. You don't have to have your mobile phone with the network offering mobile broadband to get an internet connection from them. </p> <p>While the number of people signing up to mobile broadband is soaring, our commentators do not recommend that the service should replace fixed-line broadband for most households. 'It makes a lot of sense if you are a student or in a transient situation, but at the moment the speeds aren't good enough to rival fixed-line services,' says Michael Phillips of <a href=\"http://www.Broadbandchoices.co.uk\">Broadbandchoices.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>Andrew Ferguson agrees. 'The mobile broadband deals start from about \u00a310 a month so look quite good value,' he says. 'However the big caveat to watch out for is the excess-usage policies of these companies. Download beyond your agreed limit and you can be hit with hundreds of pounds in penalties.'</p> <p>Parker also points out that on the cheaper pay-as-you-go mobile broadband packages, and even on some of the contract deals, you have to pay for the 'dongle' - the device you plug into your computer to get the service. The price of these typically ranges from \u00a350 to \u00a3100.</p> <p><strong>What our experts recommend</strong></p> <p>We asked three experts from price comparison and forum websites to identify the pick of the current crop of broadband deals, based on overall value. </p> <p>James Parker of Moneysupermarket.com says: 'Some of the smaller players, including Plusnet and Madasafish, come out well on price and service. O2 also ranks well on customer service and is cheap, especially if you are already an O2 mobile customer.'</p> <p>Michael Phillips of Broadbandchoices.co.uk says: 'If you spend a lot of time on the phone, TalkTalk's combined broadband and phone package will save you a lot of money. I do think the company is over the problems it had. Sky are always winning awards for service so are also a good choice. If you are a heavy user then O2 or Be come out well for speed.'</p> <p>Andrew Ferguson of Thinkbroadband.com recommends O2, 'even for users who are slightly above the average for download use'. He adds: 'Zen has a very good service reputation but is best suited to business customers such as those who work from home, as its packages aren't the cheapest. Lots of people like Waitrose because it gives all its profits back to charity.'</p> <p>Whom to avoid? Some customers will have had a good experience with these firms, which both offer relatively cheap deals, but more than one of our experts were critical of Tiscali and Toucan.</p> <h2>Download this</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Consider your download activity and check what the financial penalties are if you exceed your download allowance.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What is the length of contract? Some providers will tie you in for as much as two years. What are the penalties for leaving the deal early, and will they allow you to take your service with you if you move house?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have found a better deal than your current one, call your existing provider. It has been known for some companies to offer 'retention deals' to get customers to stay.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Watch out for introductory offers.

  "<p>Lina grips her face with her hands and lets out a groan of pain. Her uncle is standing over her, his hands forming the shape of a pistol and pointing down at an imaginary body on the floor. 'They had him on the ground, like this,' he says. 'They fired two shots into his head from here.'</p> <p>'They humiliated him before killing him?' wails Lina, tears running down her face. Her body is bent double at the news of her brother's death. Gunned down aged 27 in her home town of Florencia, southern Colombia, he was murdered, she believes, by her former 'boss' - her commandant in the ruthless guerrilla army, Farc.</p> <p>Lina was a member of Farc - the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - for seven years. Last December, exhausted and demoralised, she deserted, handing herself in to the army. Farc does not take such betrayal lightly. A terrible revenge has been exacted upon her family.</p> <p>Her compact body is built for life in the jungle; she has strong arms, black hair tied back in a functional ponytail, and long unmanicured nails. From the age of 13, when she signed up, her bed was a cambuche, made from sticks hacked from the trees or a bit of plastic thrown over roots and stones on the ground. She ate lentils, rice and beans - sometimes supplementing them with cockroaches, ants and worms (the big white ones were the best - 'they tasted like butter'). And she saw combat many times - she still has the angry welt where an army bullet pierced her neck and exited through her upper arm. ('They gave me aspirin and sent me to recover back at the camp.')</p> <p>Today things look different. In a moment of reflection, she glances out of the window of her uncle's bungalow in a grubby, frenetic barrio of Bogota. 'I still can't believe it when I wake up and see the city,' she says. 'I never thought I would get a chance to live like this.'</p> <p>Lina is one of the thousands of Colombian women who have joined the ranks of Farc. Founded as a peasant militia in 1964, Farc still has its roots in hardline Marxist ideology. For more than four decades it has conducted an implacable battle with the Colombian state and the rival paramilitary death squads of the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC). Farc began as a rural movement, but has been gradually driven into bases deep inside Colombia's near-impenetrable jungles, some of which are almost the size of Switzerland.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, hard facts about the rebel group are difficult to come by. The government puts its troop numbers at around 9,000, while other estimates have it at over 30,000. What is better understood is how Farc finances its campaign - through the cocaine trade, kidnapping and extortion.</p> <p>My visit to Colombia comes a few days after the release of Farc hostage Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate who was seized in 2002 and held in the jungle, sometimes chained by the neck. The rescue of Betancourt - along with 14 other captives - at the hands of military intelligence officers posing as aid workers has hit the group's morale; her description of the 'exceptional malice' with which Farc treats its captives has damaged its international standing further. It is estimated that Farc now holds 700 hostages.</p> <p>But there's a surprising aspect of Farc's armed struggle: like the kidnap victims, many of the rebel group's own frontline fighters also see themselves as prisoners. And another unusual aspect of this 'war' - around 40 per cent of Farc's frontline soldiers are female.</p> <p>Lina joined after her mother left home and her father was left struggling to support five children. 'I didn't want to be a problem for him. Farc promised me an education and a wage, so I went to live with them.' Neither of those promises were honoured once she arrived - and it was made clear that any attempt to leave would be punishable by death.</p> <p>Carolina Escobar Neira is the manager of a programme for former combatants at the Colombian government's High Council for Reintegration. 'Farc has traditionally had a policy of equality among its troops,' she says. 'Women are expected to do the same work as men, whether that is heavy manual work, long marches or combat.' </p> <p>Farc women, however, often face a life of sexual exploitation, fear and physical abuse. Contraceptive injections are administered forcibly and pregnancies are dealt with by means of abortions with whatever basic medical equipment is to hand.</p> <p>'They teach you all this Marxist philosophy and then treat you like a slave,' says Lina. Betancourt, too, recalled her shock at the group's treatment of its own female soldiers. 'They were victims, too,' she said. 'I've always had a lot of esteem for them. The girls are tiny, but I've seen them carry heavy logs just like the men. They are slaves.' </p> <p>It's 20 July, Independence Day in Colombia. Hundreds of thousands of protestors have spilled out on to the streets, amid cries of 'Liberty, Liberty, Liberty!' Magazine racks on street corners show Betancourt's weary but glamorous face, alongside triumphant headlines predicting Farc's demise. T-shirts hanging in shop windows tell a similar story. Their slogan reads: 'No more kidnappings, no more extortion, no more Farc!'</p> <p>There's a mood of optimism in the air. In March, spokesman Raul Reyes, seen as Farc's number two, was killed in Ecuador, in a cross-border raid by Colombian troops. Days later, another member of Farc's ruling body was murdered by his bodyguard. Then in May, Manuel 'Sureshot' Marulanda, Farc's founder and commander, died of a heart attack. Many Colombians hope these events signal the beginning of the end of the organisation they blame for wreaking havoc and destruction upon their country. </p> <p>'The collective sensation is that Farc is in its final stages,' says Carlos Montoya, of the National Commission for Reparation and Reintegration. 'The Colombian people have given a clear signal that it is time for them to demobilise.' </p> <p>President Alvaro Uribe's hardline stance is credited by many with getting the country back on its feet. But any improvement has come at a price. Uribe's government and associates are mired in allegations of involvement in the drugs trade, and senior politicians in his administration have been linked to the AUC's death squads. Amid the flurry of accusations, eight pro-Uribe congressmen have been arrested, and his foreign minister has been forced to resign. Yet, despite these scandals, his supporters are campaigning for a third term for Uribe.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cesar Avila Romero, manager of the Esmeralda Peace Home in the east of the capital, has an influx on his hands. Funded by the Ministry of Defence, his place looks after women and families who have recently deserted Farc. 'This year the numbers have been incredible,' he says. 'We are really seeing a massive demobilisation. Many people are arriving here who have spent 10, 15 years in armed combat.' The government reports 1,405 desertions from Farc in 2008, a 10 per cent increase on last year. In total, since Uribe mounted a full-frontal assault on the group in 2002, it's said that nearly 10,000 Farc members have handed themselves in to the authorities.</p> <p>The Esmeralda has a caring, if slightly chaotic, atmosphere: downstairs in the TV room, rows of young men, women and children watch the evening soap opera, while others snatch a few minutes' sleep in the cramped bedrooms upstairs. A beautiful, blinking baby lies passively on the bed in Romero's office while we talk - she and her twin sister were born prematurely shortly after her mother arrived from the jungle. Both twins have suffered health problems, and her mother is still in the clinic, so he is keeping an eye on her. 'We try to unite families here. Many women arrive feeling that everyone is the enemy - it is our job to show them civil society has something to offer.'</p> <p>Marcela, 26, has been living at the Esmeralda since May. She deserted Farc after nine years serving in various fronts in the regions of Choco and Antioquia. Petite and pretty, she says she still wakes at night dreaming she is back in the jungle with helicopters overhead and Farc hunting her through the trees. Sometimes she falls out of bed, being unused to sleeping on a mattress after so long on the ground. Being outside Farc 'feels good though. This was the only decision I could make. With time the fear will go away.'</p> <p>She says conditions have deteriorated for Farc soldiers on the front line. 'When President Uribe arrived everything changed. The commanders were under more pressure. There was more hunger, and more punishment.' She had been living on a diet of pasta, water and salt, and the death penalty was regularly administered to those accused of being 'traitors' or 'infiltrators'. </p> <p>'When I joined, it was a big deal to sentence a comrade to death. Now, they are getting so desperate that they will kill people for stealing sugar,' says Marcela. Increasing numbers thought about leaving - the 400-strong front had dwindled to 83. 'When we heard the news [about the death of Raul Reyes] we thought - \"If he can't survive, what on earth will happen to us?\"'</p> <p>Marcela went through two forced abortions during her time with Farc, and now dreams of starting a family. 'It's a priority. But not yet - I have to get back on my feet first.'</p> <p>Family is one of the strongest motivations for women - and many men - to attempt the transition into civilian life. Romance in the ranks is frowned upon; couples who wish to have a sexual relationship have to ask their commander for permission, and they can be split up at any time if it is deemed necessary.</p> <p>In San Cristobal, a hillside barrio on the outskirts of Bogota, one family has stayed together despite the best efforts of the guerrillas. The home of Esperanza Sierra Ramirez, 26, and Jose Orlando Aguirre, 36, is a picture of domestic bliss. Beans and potatoes sprout from a small patch of earth outside the front door, and two dogs chase each other in the chilly morning air. Esperanza is getting her two-year-old son Jose Eduardo ready for nursery, heating his milk in the kitchen while his father dresses him in dungarees and a woolly balaclava.</p> <p>Orlando and Esperanza served together in Farc for four years, eventually deserting in 2005. Orlando was a committed revolutionary, while Esperanza joined, she says, 'for love', having met Orlando at a party in her home town of Ibague. 'I was very innocent when I met him,' she says, stirring the saucepan of milk and smiling fondly at her husband. 'I didn't even know there was such a thing as a guerrilla. When I first went to the camps I found the physical labour and the lack of food hard. But I was very much in love - at that time I wouldn't have changed my decision for anything in the world.' She admits there were also elements of the lifestyle she liked. 'It wasn't like in ordinary life where the woman has to wash her husband's underpants. In Farc everyone has to look after themselves.' </p> <p>The crisis came when their commander decided to split the couple up, sending them off to different fronts. They didn't know whether they would ever see one another again. 'I wanted to die. I felt like part of my soul had gone,' says Esperanza. For Orlando, who was becoming increasingly disillusioned with Farc's mistreatment of its troops and its abuse of civilians, the separation was the last straw. </p> <p>'I had always thought the most important thing was the revolution,' he says. 'But when I had to say goodbye to Esperanza I found myself crying in the ranks. I had to ask for permission to sit down. Everybody was shocked - they had never seen me cry. I started to realise I was abandoning my wife for the sake of a revolution that was never going to happen.' </p> <p>Another recent deserter resorted to particularly dramatic measures in order to return to the family she had left behind when she joined Farc. Sitting in her mother's sparse sitting room in a Bogota housing estate, she looks every inch the typical city girl: manicured nails, carefully groomed hair, white trousers. Amalia now has a respectable job in a travel agency and keeps her guerrilla past a secret from her neighbours. When she went to the camps, her two-year-old daughter was sent to live in Bogota with her grandmother but, after two-and-a-half years, Amalia could no longer bear the separation. 'I was given the task of looking after an airstrip, and I saw my opportunity,' she says. She got on to the plane with her gun and told the pilot he was being hijacked. 'He went very pale and did what I said.' On the journey to freedom she read her horoscope in the newspaper El Tiempo. 'It said I was about to start a new cycle in my life. I remember thinking how true it was.'</p> <p>Amalia suffered a traumatic forced abortion during her time in the jungle. She was given drugs which succeeded in killing the foetus, but not in provoking a miscarriage. The foetus was later extracted with pincers, and she was given just 20 days' rest before going back into combat. 'I was so angry with the commander. Farc say their policy is social equality, but internally they don't practise that. That is why there is so much demobilisation. And women suffer worst of all.'</p> <p>Female combatants often find it harder than their male colleagues to fit back into civilian society. 'Women feel more rejection from people in the community, because they have broken not only social rules but also the rules of gender,' says Carolina Escobar Neira of the government's High Council for Reintegration. 'Nevertheless, we find that women take better advantage than men of the government programmes available to former combatants. They are more likely than men to attend counselling sessions and workshops, and to take up further study.'</p> <p>There are signs, too, that bonds of gender can be a powerful force in promoting peace and reconciliation. Valledupar is a sweltering pueblo nestling just inland from Colombia's Caribbean coast. It was a traditional heartland for the AUC paramilitaries until a demobilisation agreement with the government in 2006, and on its strangely quiet streets people are still tense, suspicious. It is here that an extraordinary group of women have achieved post-conflict reconciliation of a sort the government can still only dream of. </p> <p>Todos Somos Mujeres ('We are all women') consists of 40 women who meet every Thursday on the patio of a colonial house in the town centre. Half are former combatants with the AUC; the other half had children or husbands killed by the same group. Through sharing their experiences, the two sides have formed a strong bond and now hope to start workshops with both women and men across the country.</p> <p>In the shade of a mango tree, the women sit hand in hand and explain how they overcame their grief and resentment towards one another. 'Initially we were very defensive in the presence of the victims. In order to ask for forgiveness you have to forgive yourself first,' says Luz Paulina de la Rosa, 42, a former combatant. </p> <p>Otilia Cordoba, an outspoken community leader whose teacher son was killed by the paramilitaries, testifies to the group's healing effect for the victims. 'I no longer simply think of myself as a victim,' she says. 'Or rather, I realise the women in the armed groups are victims, too. I think as women we realise that, for the sake of our families, we have to try to reach out to the other side. Otherwise how much lower will Colombia sink?'</p> <p>Could such a programme work for Farc women? Clara Rojas, who was kidnapped with Betancourt while working as her aide, thinks so. I meet her at a breakfast reception in a smart club in Bogota, where she is due to give a speech to a group of immaculately dressed upper-class women. Rojas's lined face betrays some of the strain of the past years. At liberty only since January, she's had just a few months to get to know her four-year-old son Emmanuel, who was taken from her by the rebels when he was eight months old in order to seek medical treatment, and was not reunited with his mother until her release.</p> <p>Rojas basks in the attention and adoration heaped upon her by the audience. She explains that during her time in the jungle she developed strong, affectionate relationships with some of her female guards. 'At first, I found the female Farc very harsh, very tough,' she says. Things changed when she was pregnant, and she was isolated from the other hostages with only two female guards. Emmanuel's birth left the baby with a broken arm - and his mother in bed for 40 days.</p> <p>'During the pregnancy I got very ill, and when my son was born I nearly died. If it hadn't been for those two women, I never would have survived. We developed a very intense female solidarity: they were the ones who urged me to pull through for the sake of my son, and they cared for him when I couldn't.'</p> <p>Rojas believes Farc's female members should have an important role in bringing the group's members back into civilian society. 'Through women you can change things a lot. You can see they suffer - not only in the small ways like being deprived of female clothes and identity, but also in the fact they are not able to achieve the most minimum level of security for themselves and their families. In my experience, lots of Farc women would like a change. I think there is work we could do there.'</p> <p>But for many Colombians, both victim and combatant, the cycle of suffering is still red raw. Back at the apartment owned by Lina's uncle, no talk of change, of optimism, of solidarity will bring back her murdered brother. Oblivious to the non-stop urban roar of the taxis and street vendors outside, Lina, and her aunts and cousins gather around a mobile phone in the kitchen. They're looking at pictures of the young man sentenced to death by Farc merely for being the brother of a deserter. Lina's mother and her surviving sibling have been forced to flee their home, with no money and nowhere to go. </p> <p>Lina wipes away a tear. The words she utters don't convey the desperation in her voice. 'Son of a bitch,' she cries. No matter how hard she tries to run, war just keeps catching up with her.</p>",
  "<h2>Ingredients</h2> <p>6 duck breasts, preferably female</p> <p><strong>For the marinade</strong></p> <p>75g palm sugar or light brown sugar</p> <p>3 tbs water</p> <p>6 stars of star anise</p> <p>2 thumbs fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped</p> <p>6 tbs sweet soy sauce (or Ketjap Manis)</p> <p>1 tbs chopped coriander stem</p> <p>1 tbs sesame oil</p> <p>\u00bd tsp dried chilli flakes, or to taste</p> <p>3 tbs chopped coriander leaves</p> <p><strong>To prepare the duck</strong></p> <p>There is a lot of fat on duck breasts, which if not trimmed down will result in dramatic flaming and consequent unwanted smoking. Place the duck breasts skin side down on the chopping board. Run your fingers along between the fatty skin and the meat to begin to separate the two. </p> <p>Keeping the breasts skin side down, trim the loose fat off to around 5mm from the edges of the meat on each side and at the top and the bottom of each breast. Do not trim off any of the meat. Turn the breast skin side up and score the fat at 1cm intervals, criss-crossed on a diagonal, giving a diamond harlequin pattern. </p> <p><strong>For the marinade</strong></p> <p>Melt the sugar in a pan with the water and star anise. When the sugar has melted, take the pan off the heat and add the other marinade ingredients. </p> <p>Allow the marinade to cool completely before thoroughly coating the duck breasts on both sides. Cover and refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or preferably overnight. Remove from the fridge around 20 minutes before grilling. </p> <p><strong>Barbecue </strong></p> <p>Duck is at its most tender when cooked pink, so be careful not to overcook. Pre-heat the barbecue to medium. Clean and lightly oil the rack. For a pink-medium result, place the duck breasts skin-side down on the brushed and oiled barbecue grill or sandwich rack. Grill for 4-5 minutes to produce a crispy skin before turning. Grill on the flesh side for a further 4-5 minutes. Place on a warm plate or tray, cover with foil (leaving a gap to allow steam to escape) and let the duck rest for at least 5 minutes before carving.</p> <p><strong>To serve </strong></p> <p>Carve each breast on an angle into 2-3 pieces and scatter with fresh, chopped coriander leaves. Serve with rice or noodles, and Asian top-shelf sauce (see page 27) on the side.</p> <p><strong>Tips </strong></p> <p>Duck breasts are fantastic grilled on the barbecue. Ask your butcher for female rather than male duck breasts, as they make for the perfect portion size. The skin is very fatty (how else would ducks keep warm in winter waters?), so will need some keen trimming.</p> <h2>Listen to ...</h2> <p><strong>The Bees</strong><br><em>Octopus</em></p> <p>The third record by the Isle of Wight's shaggy-haired psychedelicists makes for blissful barbecuing music, mainly because they try their hand at every genre of music - reggae, soul and Merseybeat among them - ever used in conjunction with the phrase 'good vibes'.

  "<p>For Michael O'Leary, the aggressive chief executive of Ryanair, last week's decision by the Competition Commission to recommend the break-up of BAA could not have been sweeter. O'Leary has not been alone in arguing that BAA's ownership of London's three main airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - was bad for competition and damaging for air travellers, but he has been the noisiest and most consistent campaigner. </p> <p>The commission's decision was a humiliating blow for BAA, which also owns Southampton Airport in the south of England and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen in Scotland. It will continue to fight its case and Colin Matthews, the BAA chief executive, says it will not sell Heathrow; but it is inevitable that its dominance of the British aviation market is coming to an end. </p> <p>For Ferrovial, the Spanish company that bought BAA in a highly leveraged deal in 2006, the commission's decision may be a blessing in disguise, and its shares rose on the news. The sale of Stansted, Gatwick and either Glasgow or Edinburgh will bring in at least \u00a35bn, enough to halve its debts and still leave it with control of Heathrow.</p> <p>The extent of the commission's rejection of BAA's monopoly was a shock, despite an earlier, highly critical report from the Office of Fair Trading. It had been expected that BAA would be required to sell one London airport, but not two, and there would have been little surprise if the Commission had opted for a tighter regulatory regime instead of a forced sale. Remarkably it went for both, arguing that a break-up and a change in regulation were required. </p> <p>For O'Leary, it was better than he could have hoped. He has waged a relentless war of attrition against BAA, accusing the company of 'raping' passengers and abusing its monopoly position to set ever high charges. He has fought court battles against fuel levies, refused to pay increased charges and has lampooned BAA's management as incompetent 'Keystone Cops'. </p> <p>His attacks on BAA have been matched in their ferocity by those on the regulatory structure in which it operates, and which the commission has now accepted should be reviewed. </p> <p>At the moment, BAA is allowed to recoup a set percentage of what it spends on new infrastructure - an arrangement that O'Leary believes gives it the incentive to spend too much. He has bitterly opposed BAA's plans to spend almost \u00a34bn on new facilities at Stansted, arguing that the airport's capacity could be doubled by spending a tenth of that amount on functional facilities for low-cost airlines. Implicitly, the commission agrees and O'Leary, for once, finds himself in step with the powers-that-be.</p> <p>It is not his normal place. O'Leary has made his name and built his company by fighting the airline and regulatory establishments whenever he could. He has waged court battles against BAA and British Airways, Lufthansa, Sabena and the Dublin Airport Authority. </p> <p>His most bruising encounters have come against the European Commission - an institution for which he has total contempt - but his successes until now have been limited. The commission has struck two heavy blows against him in the past, first deeming unlawful the incentives Ryanair received to operate routes from Charleroi airport near Brussels, and then blocking his proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.</p> <p>Joe Gill, an aviation analyst with Dublin stockbroking firm Bloxham, says the Competition Commission ruling 'is a huge fillip' for O'Leary. 'This proves to him that attritional warfare works, that if you stick at it you will eventually grind down the opposition and get a victory. It will fire him up for the major battles he still faces, and it's the last thing his opponents could have wished for.'</p> <p>Those battles include a renewed attempt to seize control of Aer Lingus and a longer-running battle with the Irish government over the operation of Dublin airport. O'Leary wants a competitor to the Dublin Airport Authority, the existing airport operator, to run the new terminal, already under construction.</p> <p>His objective is not complex: O'Leary wants airports to be cheap, efficient and functional. He does not believe that passengers want to spend hours wandering through a shopping 'experience' - they want to 'park, go through, get on the plane and get the hell out of the place'.</p> <p>O'Leary's model airport is Frankfurt Hahn, a former Nato airbase that has been transformed into a significant low-cost airport about an hour's drive from Frankfurt. Its owners, Fraport, developed it at minimal cost. No marbled halls, no lavish shopping malls, just basic services that keep costs low. O'Leary now says that he is prepared to work closely with whoever eventually buys Stansted from BAA so that a similarly cost-effective expansion can be put in place.</p> <p>He has, however, distanced himself from reports that Ryanair itself would consider bidding for control of the Essex airport. 'That's not a direction that investors want him to take,' says Gill.</p> <p>The real battles for O'Leary, however, are not with BAA but with oncoming recession on both sides of the Irish Sea and the high price of oil. Ryanair's profits will be wiped out this year but O'Leary is still pushing for expansion, even though he is also putting planes and routes on ice for part of the winter. It is a gamble, but a calculated one.</p> <p>O'Leary has argued for years that Europe's airline industry faces Armageddon and this year's oil price explosion has made his predictions of doom more real. The crunch time, analysts say, will come in October and November as the market sags towards the low volumes that characterise the winter months. Airlines that have been kept afloat by strong summer cash flows will be in serious risk of collapse within a matter of weeks and Ryanair will be aiming to mop up by offering low fares and plenty of flights.</p> <p>The scale of the crisis in the industry can be measured, in part, by the disappearance of rumours that O'Leary was preparing to step down from Ryanair. Less than two years ago, when profits were soaring and Ryanair's trajectory seemed effortless, O'Leary toyed with the possibility of retirement. Now, with battles to be fought on all fronts, his blood is up and his energies are focused on taking his airline through the turmoil and out the other side as Europe's dominant short-haul carrier. </p> <p>The shape of that short-haul market is already becoming clear, with consolidation gathering pace around the three major airline conglomerates of Air France/KLM, Lufthansa and BA. They are expected to swallow the smaller airlines like Austrian Airlines, SAS and BMI, along with perennial strugglers like Italy's Alitalia. The only genuine competition to this consolidated group will come from the low-cost industry - Ryanair and EasyJet in particular.</p> <p>The conundrum for the European Commission, which must approve any mergers, is one that O'Leary will delight in exploiting. How can it allow the emergence of three major groups in Europe while also arguing that a merger of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would create a damaging monopoly in Ireland?</p> <p>Whatever its reasoning, O'Leary will be certain to challenge it, haranguing the commission and painting it as the protector of high-price airlines. </p> <p>It was not a coincidence that his Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning racehorse was named War of Attrition. With the scent of victory in the air again, O'Leary will be more relentless than ever.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> Michael O'Leary</p> <p><strong>Job</strong> Chief executive, Ryanair</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Clongowes Wood College; Trinity College, Dublin</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> 1984-86, tax consultant at accountants KPMG; 1988-present, director of Ryanair, chief executive since 1994</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Anita, a former banker; two sons</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> horse racing, cattle breeding (owns herd of Aberdeen Angus)</p>",
  "<p>When London Mayor Boris Johnson receives the Olympic flag from his Beijing counterpart today, it will mark the beginning of a four-year golden journey culminating in the London games.</p> <p>Golden, that is, for some of the world's richest tycoons and companies. With a public sector budget pot worth \u00a39.35bn, there is plenty to play for. </p> <p>The anticipation of a financial windfall from the London games was so great that international property barons had already laid claim to their medals immediately after the International Olympic Committee awarded the event to London in July 2005.</p> <p>Quickest off the mark were the low-profile billionaire Reuben brothers, who made their fortune in the murky waters of the Russian metal industry following the break-up of the Soviet Union. The Reubens, together with Multiplex, the troubled firm that built Wembley stadium, and Westfield, the world's biggest shopping centre developer, owned the development rights around Stratford station - land on which key Olympic facilities will soon be built.</p> <p>The Reubens, after a protracted and acrimonious tussle with their partners and former London Mayor Ken Livingstone, sold their strategic land holdings two years ago. Following what were described as tense and sometimes explosive negotiations, some suggest the Reubens emerged with a clear profit in excess of \u00a3100m.</p> <p>With the Reubens installed as the London Olympics windfall sprint champions, the way is clear for the principal Olympic-zone landowners to take the long-distance medals.</p> <p>Australia may have conceded defeat in the race to overtake team GB in the Beijing medals table, but its biggest property companies are well placed to clean up in the business blue riband event for being top economic beneficiaries. Many Olympic insiders reckon gold in this event is set to go to David Crawford, the chairman of giant Australian developer Lend Lease. Pushing him all the way is Westfield founder Frank Lowy.</p> <p>Lend Lease was awarded the development rights to a huge area in and around Stratford, east London, two years ago. This includes building and financing the troubled Olympic village project at more than \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Lend Lease, which has been pulling out of UK town-centre projects as the property market plunges, has found it hard to get bank backing for the project. This has resulted in an increased contribution from the Olympic Delivery Authority. It is understood Lend Lease and its financial backers are putting more than \u00a3600m into the project, with \u00a3400m coming from taxpayers. </p> <p>Some argue Lend Lease has used the credit crunch as a way of 'de-risking' the village project. But sources close the firm insist it is contributing in excess of \u00a3250m, which amounts to a major commitment on what will be a difficult project from which to make money.</p> <p>But the Olympic village represents a fraction of Lend Lease's interest in Stratford. It is committed to another 4.5 million sq ft project to be built after the games, which will include more housing, offices and hotels with a potential value of \u00a33.5bn.</p> <p>Lend Lease's project, overseen in the UK by respected real estate figure Nigel Hugill, will benefit from the huge scale of improvements and prominence coming to what has for the past 10 years been an up-and-coming part of the capital.</p> <p>Lend Lease's potential Olympic windfall may ultimately eclipse the one that could go to Westfield's Lowy, the Jewish-Hungarian emigr\u00e9 who settled in Australia after the war. Lowy persuaded the Olympic Delivery Authority to hand over what is understood to be in excess of \u00a3100m to ensure that a 2 million sq ft shopping centre next to Stratford station in east London is open in time for the main event.</p> <p>The money is going into key infrastructure associated with the mall, which has already secured John Lewis, Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer as key tenants. Property sources say Lowy has pulled off a master stroke. 'This centre was already going to be built,' said one. 'Lowy is being given money for something that was already going to happen.' </p> <p>A Westfield spokesman downplayed the idea that it has directly benefited from the games. He insisted that the company, which in the next few weeks will open a major new mall at White City in west London, is risking \u00a31.5bn to build the shopping centre. It is also building a new ticket hall at Stratford station, as well as contributing to a combined heat and power system which will supply the Olympic facilities.</p> <p>Both the Olympic Delivery Authority and Westfield refuse to reveal how much money Lowy has received but The Observer understands that Culture Select Committee members will push ODA officials for an answer on the issue.</p> <p>Other major firms expected to secure handsome profits from the games include project manager CLM, which is a consortium of firms that includes CH2M Hill, Laing O'Rourke and Mace. CLM is on a performance-related contract based on hitting key targets. As things stand, the 'Big Build' is ahead of schedule so the consortium is on track to scoop a substantial share of the \u00a3600m programme management budget.</p> <p>Carillion, led by John McDonough, has won the \u00a3300m-plus contract to build the Games' huge media centre, in a joint venture with regeneration fund Igloo. If it can find a tenant to take over the state-of-the-art facility once the Games have finished - ITV is known to have been approached - the deal should prove particularly profitable, especially in the light of speculation that the ODA will be making a substantial contribution to the costs of construction. The ODA would not comment on the rumours.</p> <p>The construction industry will also benefit from the expected addition of 12,000 new hotel rooms; London's hotel market already has 130,000 rooms spread between 1,600 operators. Tourism leaders are readying themselves for a \u00a32.2bn windfall in London and, nationally, a projected \u00a32.9bn.</p> <p>This has led to protests that the rest of the country outside London will miss out on tourism revenue. But some industry figures believe Olympic spectators will extend their UK stay. </p> <p>There is an expectation that national sporting bodies, representing in particular cycling, swimming, sailing and rowing, will get significant tranches of money from the private sector following the success in those pursuits at Beijing. And sport science businesses will find their services more in demand as UK sport bodies gear up to ensure athletes reach their full potential for 2012. </p> <p>The operator of the aquatic centre has not been chosen yet. But the favourite to win the contract will be GLL, the biggest operator of municipal leisure facilities in London. GLL is a social enterprise, a business with a social mission, and winning the contract would be a significant boost for the sector as a whole, which is championed by both Gordon Brown and Tory leader David Cameron. There is, however, concern that an operator needs to be chosen quickly so that it can be part of the design process for the facility.</p> <p>The other beneficiaries ought to be east Londoners lucky enough to own their own homes. Since the bid was won in 2005, house prices in the Olympic boroughs of Waltham Forest, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Greenwich rose faster than other parts of the capital. They have also fallen less in recent months. The downside is that many are priced out of home ownership in some of the poorest areas of London.</p> <p>But, according to the ODA, the games will 'transform an area previously contaminated and derelict into one of the largest new urban parks in Europe for 150 years'.</p> <p>The original reason to bid for the games was to catalyse the building of 40,000 much-needed homes and raise horizons for areas that today make the news because of teenage gun and knife crime. Achieving this will be an Olympic challenge worthy of a gold medal.</p> <h2>Fears for the losers</h2> <p>The Olympics will see London win at the expense of the rest of the country. Areas outside London could lose as much as \u00a34bn in economic activity, according to some estimates, as money pours into the capital.</p> <p>Being awarded the games triggered a flurry of infrastructure cash for London after years of vacillating by Labour and Conservative governments. The green light was given to the \u00a310bn Crossrail project and extensions to the East London and Docklands Light Railway lines. The Olympics will also see additional road upgrades.</p> <p>Complaints have been aired about the possibility that the Olympics will suck money out of grassroots sport. Many clubs currently receiving Lottery funding fear they will lose out to the Games. The Treasury could remedy this by ensuring the UK's 40,000 community sport clubs are eligible for tax breaks, such as business rate relief and gift aid. Such a move could see up to \u00a3400m of cash flow back into sport.</p> <p>There are also concerns that small firms will miss out on supply contracts. Culture, Media and Sport select committee member Paul Farrelly is angry that a company based in his north Staffordshire constituency in the Potteries lost out on a contract to make ceramic mugs for the games. Ironically, it was given to a Chinese firm. </p> <p>Ensuring the greatest show on earth goes off without a hitch is the relatively easy bit. Ensuring east London and the rest of the country experiences tangible economic and social benefits from the Games is the true test of whether all the investment has been made wisely.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone remember Owen Hargreaves' England debut? Don't all shout at once, it was in an eminently forgettable and highly experimental August friendly against Holland at White Hart Lane seven years ago.</p> <p>England lost 2-0, were given a lesson in passing and ball retention, Hargreaves was one of 10 players replaced at or just after the interval (Nick Barmby, since you ask) and Sven-Goran Eriksson received his first panning as England manager for his daft use of substitutes and for generally insulting the paying public with such a lame display.</p> <p>What happened next? Seventeen days later Eriksson's England travelled to Munich and thrashed Germany 5-1, inflicting a first ever home qualifying defeat on seemingly invincible hosts and more than making up for the Wembley defeat that had made Kevin Keegan quit, leading to a search for a successor that widened to overseas candidates. Nothing that happened in the friendly turned out to be a reliable pointer to the real thing. England went from rabble to royalty in just over a fortnight. </p> <p>If Fabio Capello knows his history he might be pondering these events right now, having just presided over an early-season shambles of his own. The similarities to seven years ago are quite striking, except that Hargreaves, now a key performer for England, might not be fit for the trip to Zagreb on 10 September. It was Croatia who last beat England at Wembley, bringing about the downfall of Steve McClaren (not to mention Brian Barwick) and giving Capello the chance to impress the FA with his CV. Like Germany in 2001, Croatia are also unbeaten at home in competitive matches. Partly because they have a relatively short history, partly because they can summon a fierce national pride and express it on the pitch, but mostly because they are actually quite good at football. Croatia kicking sand in Germany's face at Klagenfurt in Euro 2008 was one of the performances of the summer, even if it was the Germans who subsequently reached the final. </p> <p>Capello put on a brave front afterwards, though he must have been privately depressed at the thought of having to match that amount of spirit and unity with the dogged individuals under his control. If so, he must be doubly depressed after seeing his players so easily subdued by the Czech Republic, a sort of Croatia-lite who have the touch and the skills but can usually be brushed aside by determined opponents, a bit like Milan Baros. </p> <p>Perhaps one should never read to much into a friendly at this time of the year, but Capello picked out Wednesday's months ago as the deadline for England to be competitive and to show they could play as a team. You didn't need to be Harry Redknapp to spot the flaws, though the Portsmouth manager's caustic comments did add much needed spice to what would otherwise have been an unforgivably insipid Wembley occasion. </p> <p>Never mind for the time being whether there is any difference to the naked eye between Steven Gerrard playing wide left but drifting inside in search of the ball and Gerrard doing as he is told and operating as supporting snowman in a Christmas tree formation, the time for debate over midfield permutations has been and gone. In Zagreb in a couple of weeks' time (assuming England can first overcome the obstacle presented by Andorra), the moment of truth arrives. Eriksson was never so surprised as when he was accorded a round of applause on entering the press room post-Munich, and neither were many English journalists. Capello would deserve something similar if England are unexpectedly terrific in Croatia, though if things go badly he will be accused of wasting the past six months and failing to fix positional problems familiar to his predecessors.</p> <p>Which will it be? It depends on Wayne Rooney. England do not have a go-to man at the moment and Rooney was so far from both the front line and his former self against the Czechs that Capello could reasonably consider dropping him for the next fixture on the grounds that he cannot see what all the fuss is about. That may be a mistake, both because England do not have many more striking options and because Rooney is the sort of mood player who can respond to adversity or criticism by seizing control of a game and making things happen. We think. It is becoming harder and harder to remember when this last happened, though we do know that Rooney used to be capable of rising to the occasion. It may be a slim hope to cling to, but even a Rooney who spends most of his time in the centre circle looking for the ball has a better record of international rescue than Emile Heskey or Jermain Defoe. </p> <p>'If you can score a goal then things can change completely,' Capello said helpfully at Wembley. Let's not bother rolling our eyes and remarking on the sort of insight \u00a36.5m a year buys you these days, let's be positive and credit Capello with identifying the problem. England need more goals. More early goals, more goals from open play, more goals from Rooney and whoever is playing up front with him. Midfielders such as Frank Lampard and Gerrard - if it is OK with Capello to refer to the latter as a midfielder - will enjoy more scoring opportunities if central defenders are being engaged by the strikers. If Capello is hinting that he knows a way to get England a goal or two then fine, confidence and cohesiveness will naturally follow. If he is merely bluffing, trusting to luck and hoping that England are bound to be better when all the players are match...#8209;fit and competitive games finally start, then McClaren is at the end of a phone in Holland to advise him otherwise. </p> <p>The difference the most expensive coaching input available can make to the same group of players is about to be put under the microscope. One could even say the entire wisdom of bringing in a foreign manager is about to be evaluated, and that Eriksson in Munich has given Capello in Zagreb a lot to live up to. That glorious precedent will always be there to encourage England at times such as this, though someone as sharp as Capello has probably noticed the parallel is not exact. Despite using a ridiculous 22 players in the Tottenham debacle, Eriksson still managed to find four fresh starters for Munich. They were David Seaman, Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Heskey. And Michael Owen played the whole game in Germany after only appearing in the second-half madness in the friendly. Quite an improvement, that. Goalkeeper, two centre-halfs, and two strikers to chip in with four of the five goals. Bloody luxury, as they probably don't say in Italy.</p> <h2>Harry can explode into life on couch</h2> <p>Harry Redknapp, TV pundit of the year. Even before he questioned Steven Gerrard's positioning, he said England were awful and that Steve McClaren had supervised better displays, a welcome blast of unvarnished truth that put other channels' less-than-critical critics to shame. It is tricky to be honest when you are the host broadcaster, but if Setanta continue in this vein, their pundits will soon be more watchable than the games. </p> <p>Steve McManaman has always been a typically forthright Scouser and is assured and articulate to boot. All he needs to do is correct the impression he gives that he played for England in some sort of golden era and he could go a long way. Terry Venables has been a long way and now seems to be coming back. As England coach he was world-class at talking knowledgeably for hours without giving anything away, and he is still at it. When addressing an appalled audience a few more trenchant opinions might not go amiss, though there is no need to liven up the mix with Redknapp on the couch. </p> <p>Having a pithy opinion relayed to the England manager in mid-press conference is the ultimate accolade for a pundit, and Redknapp is a relative novice. He is also passionate about England and not wildly enthusiastic about his own claims being passed over in favour of those of a foreigner. That is not just a lively combination, it is a potentially explosive one. About time England became compulsive viewing. And as long as Harry avoids turning into a caricature of himself, this game within a game could still produce the neatest of endings.</p> <p><strong>Lost in translation</strong></p> <p>Fabio Capello's English is better than it was, and probably better than he likes to let on, but he still uses an interpreter to iron out misunderstandings. Such as the one at Wembley late on Wednesday night when he was trying to emphasise the positives and the assembled media representatives were shaking their heads. </p> <p>'We are not as disappointed as you are,' Capello insisted. 'The biggest problem in this country is the newspapers, not the supporters.'</p> <p>'Yeah, we keep giving the ball away don't we?' one of the chippier scribes challenged. </p> <p>'Could you repeat that question please?' the interpreter asked. </p> <p>'I said the newspapers keep giving the ball away.' </p> <p>'That was a question?'</p> <p>'No it was a joke.'</p> <p>'A joke?' asked Capello. </p> <p>'No, just a question.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday August 31 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below, we referred to Tom Bradley's 'unsuccessful bid for the governorship of Los Angeles'. Los Angeles has a mayor, not a governor. Bradley, who was mayor from 1973 to 1993, ran unsuccessfully in 1982 and 1986 for the governorship of California. This has been corrected</p> <p> </p> <p>Standing next to his street stall of glassware in downtown Denver, Jim Butcher was delighted that Barack Obama and the Democrats were holding their convention in his city this week.</p> <p>He hoped to make a killing selling his wares to the 50,000 visitors, including 15,000 journalists, who are descending on Colorado's state capital. But Butcher, who is a registered independent, did not intend to vote for Obama in November.</p> <p>'I think, at the moment, I am going for [John] McCain,' he said. Asked if there was anything Obama could do this week to persuade him to change his mind, Butcher quickly replied: 'Not really. Not much chance of that.' </p> <p>The reason, he said, was Obama's lack of experience. When asked, he said his decision had nothing to do with the colour of the candidate's skin: 'I don't care about his race.' Then he added a rider that will dismay those who watch with mounting anxiety as McCain steadily gains ground on his Democratic rival for the White House: 'There might be some people who do.' </p> <p>This week's events in Denver are fast turning into a critical moment in Obama's bid to be America's first black President. What was once seen as an anointing of his candidacy is becoming a chance to right a campaign facing a series of unexpected crises.</p> <p>The Democrats are starting to struggle in a presidential race which they should be dominating. America is beset by economic troubles, mired in an unpopular foreign war and facing an unpopular Republican party. A stunning 80 per cent of Americans think that the country is heading in the wrong direction. Yet Obama and McCain are virtually tied in the polls. The possible explanations are multiple. The Democratic campaign is being daily assaulted by withering Republican attack ads. At the same time, there are still deep scars in the party left by the ferocious battle between Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>And then there is the issue of race. It gets much less attention than the battle with Clinton, or the daily barbs traded with McCain, or Obama's struggle to rise in the polls. Yet it might provide the key to understanding the strange inability of the Obama campaign to achieve lift-off in the polls. </p> <p>'The question of this election is race. The answer we are looking for is, how much will it matter?' said Professor Shawn Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. America will soon find out. When Obama speaks on Thursday to more than 80,000 people in Denver's football stadium he will also reach a television audience of millions of Americans. They will look into the face of a man who could be their next President and for the first time it will be a black face. </p> <p>By the end of this week, America will finally be facing up to the question that might truly define the 2008 presidential race: is America ready to elect a black President to the White House?</p> <p>Obama's speech will take place in the most historic of circumstances. On the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous 'I have a dream speech', delivered at the height of the civil rights struggle, Obama will face an adoring crowd to whom he will preach a message of unity and change. 'It is hard to overstate the historic nature of this speech,' said Professor Seth Masket, a political scientist at Denver University. </p> <p>There is no denying Obama's campaign resembles King's lofty ideals. King spoke of a dream where '... my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character.' Certainly, Obama has consistently portrayed himself as 'post-racial'. His bid for the presidency has avoided race unless forced to do so. That happened once, when comments made by Obama's former pastor Rev Jeremiah Wright threatened to derail his campaign. Obama responded with a well-received speech on race in Philadelphia that was an attempt to lay the issue firmly to rest.</p> <p>Afterwards, the campaign redoubled its efforts to portray Obama in the terms of America's history as a melting pot of different ethnicities: black and white, and everything in between. That is going to be writ large at Denver in a carefully packaged message. Each day has a 'theme' designed to appeal to the middle ground. They range from 'One Nation' to 'Renewing America's Promise'. At key moments, Obama's life story will be fleshed out with an emphasis on his bi-racial history, such as having a white grandfather who fought in the Second World War. During his final speech, Obama will be surrounded by 10 ordinary Americans he met during his campaign. Denver will paint an all-American picture of Obama as an everyman figure, defying pigeonholing.</p> <p>That is a laudable aim and politically astute. It is also difficult. For the fact of race is always present. It is hard to imagine the Obama phenomenon if he were a white politician. Then he might just be another one-term senator from Middle America with a gift for oratory and little experience. But Obama's mixed racial background and its deeper meaning propels him to a different level. It also makes it harder for him to avoid addressing the issue of race. </p> <p>But America itself is often engaged in the same experience; not talking about race even though everyone is thinking about it. The polls certainly seem to suggest that some white Americans do have a problem with Obama. </p> <p>His popularity is huge among blacks and strong with Hispanics and young white voters. Yet his support struggles among older white voters, including many Democrats. Among Clinton Democrats, one fifth say they are backing McCain rather than Obama. It may be these voters care about 'experience' or other issues more than black or Hispanic or young voters. Or it might be that they are simply resistant to voting for a black man to be President, whether they know it or not. Whatever the truth, securing a decent percentage of the white vote is going to be fundamental to Obama's hopes.</p> <p>In research published in New York magazine, the pollster Thom Riehle, who founded the AP/Ipsos survey, calculates that even if the black turnout were to rise by 25 per cent from 2004, with Obama gaining a 92 per cent share, and significantly more Hispanic voters and under-50s voted for Obama than voted for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004, he would still need to win 40 per cent of the white vote - just one point less than Kerry got. As Riehle points out: 'This is a daunting task as the first black candidate for President. To get there, he's got to win roughly the same proportion of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents that all other Democrats get. If he doesn't he's in a world of trouble. He can't win it just by changing the electorate.'</p> <p>The polls themselves may be unreliable. In the past, support for African-American candidates when Americans actually cast their votes has often failed to reflect what voters told the pollsters. Most notoriously, former Mayor of Los Angeles Tom Bradley, in his unsuccessful bid for the governorship of California, came up short in a manner no one could have predicted having followed his poll ratings. American pollsters now talk about the Bradley effect.</p> <p>There is little doubt that race is going to play a starring role in this election after the convention season. 'It has not been too much of an issue so far. Or, at least not talked about. But that is not going to last,' said Bowler. It is already getting a lot of play on conservative talkshows and in books. Rush Limbaugh, the 'shock jock' who is hugely popular with white conservatives, has stepped up race-baiting on his broadcasts. He recently claimed Democrats chose Obama as a sort of 'affirmative action' programme. 'I think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy,' he told his millions of listeners. Warming to his theme a few days later, he said: 'You can't criticise the little black man-child.'</p> <p>Slightly more subtly has come a series of anti-Obama books. The most strident, and most popular, has been The Obama Nation, by Jerome Corsi, who helped mastermind the Swift Boat campaign that derailed Kerry in 2004. Corsi described Obama as having Islamic links and a Muslim past. He wants him to be seen as a scary 'Other', just like some black leaders have always been portrayed. Even the title of the book has that effect: said quickly 'Obama Nation' rapidly becomes 'abomination'. That is not likely to be an accident. </p> <p>Obama frequently warns against such attacks, acknowledging they are covertly linked to his skin colour. 'What they're going to try to do is make you scared of me ... You know, he doesn't look like all those other Presidents on those dollar bills,' he told one rally. Obama is right. Nor are such attacks going to let up. Many Republican strategists believe the Wright controversy will reassert itself. Though Obama has disavowed Wright, the preacher's black nationalist theology is still going to be fodder for anti-Obama ads. They may not come from the McCain camp itself, but from shadowy groups allied to the Republican cause. Either way, the effect will be the same. </p> <p>No matter how much Obama - and millions of other Americans - seek to take race out of the election, there will be others wanting to bring it back. McCain's campaign has even accused the Obama camp itself of playing the race card, thus cleverly injecting the issue right back into the debate. </p> <p>It was a tactic that even some on Clinton's campaign sought to use. Leaked memos from her campaign revealed that her top strategist, Mark Penn, tried to get Clinton to paint Obama as un-American. 'I cannot imagine America electing a President during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and his values,' Penn wrote in one memo. Penn is likely to have meant Obama's father's Kenyan background. But it is hard not to see some, perhaps unintentional, subtext of race. Would he have written such words if Obama's father had been Irish, and not black African?</p> <p>Clinton did not take Penn's advice, but Democrats still bear the wounds of the battle Clinton and Obama fought. That divide will be on full display in Denver. Clinton herself has been given a prime speaking slot. More controversially, so has her husband, Bill Clinton, who still damns with faint praise when it comes to Obama. Then there is the fact that Clinton's name is going to go forward in a symbolic first roll call on the convention floor. Delegates and superdelegates will be asked for their vote and estimates vary about how many will vote for Clinton. It could be as high as 1,200. This piece of political theatre was an olive branch by Obama's campaign as a way of appeasing Clinton's passionate backers. It is intended as a visible way of uniting the party. That may work. Or not.</p> <p>Larry Johnson, an intelligence consultant, runs a pro-Hillary blog. Even now, he pulls no punches when it comes to Obama. 'It is becoming clearer that he is the wrong candidate at the wrong time,' he said. </p> <p>Even if the party is healed, there are other minefields ahead in Denver. First off are the legions of protesters. They range from anti-war marchers, to environmentalists, to anti-globalisation organisations. The Denver police are also taking no chances. A complex of special holding cells - dubbed 'Gitmo on the Platte' after Denver's South Platte river - has been constructed. For a candidate desperate to ease the concerns of middle America, any violence would be a PR disaster. It would also be a moment for the Republicans to pounce and they, too, will be in Denver. Just a few blocks away from the convention hall, they have set up a media war-room, serving up stars of the Republican firmament such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. Nothing, it seems, is going to be easy in Denver this week.</p> <p>The Denver convention has gone from a coronation to a challenge. 'This is tricky. He wants to leave the convention with the party as united as possible,' said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House. Polls last week showed Obama's lead over McCain narrowing to just a few points. One, a Reuters-Zogby survey, even had McCain with a lead of five per cent. McCain, with his new aggressive strategy, is now settled into the 'happy warrior' mode. He is the insurgent underdog taking chunks out of a more favoured opponent. Yet such an analysis is unfair to Obama. A study of the electoral coalition shows just how narrow Obama's margins of victory are. His levels of support among blacks, Hispanics and young voters are already squeezed close to their likely maximum. </p> <p>In order to win in November he undoubtedly needs to persuade white, working class and elderly Americans to back him in much greater numbers. McCain needs to keep them away. That alone will ensure that the issue of race cannot remain underground. For, in the heat of the fight ahead, it could actually become the main battlefield itself.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden's long road to the Democratic ticket got off to a bad start. When he launched his own bid for the White House last year, Biden's reputation for committing verbal gaffes was swiftly confirmed. Asked what he thought of a young black senator from Illinois who was also running for President, Biden said Barack Obama was 'the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy'.</p> <p>The result was a firestorm of accusations of patronising racial insensitivity and Biden was forced into an immediate apology. Despite strong showings in the debates, Biden's presidential campaign fizzled out in the snows of Iowa and New Hampshire.</p> <p>But that was then. This is now. Biden is now joining Obama's ticket as his running mate. If the Democrats win in November, Biden will get to the White House after all, albeit as Vice-President.</p> <p>There is one reason why Obama has chosen Biden: his experience. Obama's youth may be the reason tens of thousands flock to his rallies, but it is also his Achilles heel. 'Not ready to lead' is the mantra of Republican attack ads already swarming across the television screens of America. They follow on from the most effective tactics of Hillary Clinton's defeated campaign, when she painted Obama as too naive on foreign policy and unable to deal with international crises.</p> <p>Biden is the answer to those accusations. The senator from the small state of Delaware has been on the national scene of American politics for more than three decades. His speciality is foreign policy. He has just returned from a trip to the war zones of Georgia, where he won plaudits for his efforts to support the beleaguered Georgian government. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he has travelled the world meeting foreign leaders, many of whom he counts as friends. </p> <p>That kind of experience will be an asset. So will Biden's background. His family is Irish Catholic and his father, a car salesman, moved them from the poor town of Scranton to Delaware when Biden was just 10 years old. Ironically, Biden's early career showed many similarities to Obama's rise to power. Like Obama, Biden went to college and studied law. Like Obama, Biden was a precociously young politician. He won a seat in the Senate aged just 30, becoming the fifth-youngest senator in American history. </p> <p>However, it was a moment marked by intense personal tragedy. Biden had met his first wife, Neilia Hunter, while at law school. They had three children together. But Hunter and their young daughter were killed in a car accident that also left his two sons seriously injured. Biden considered abandoning his career to care for his stricken family, but was persuaded to keep his seat. He was, in fact, sworn into office at the hospital bedside of one of his sons. Both boys recovered - one is shortly to serve a tour of duty in Iraq - and Biden eventually married again. He has had another daughter with his second wife, Jill Jacobs.</p> <p>In his long political career Biden has carved out a path as a traditional Democrat, strong with unions and the labour movement. Indeed he has been on the national scene for such a long time that he first ran for the White House in 1988. </p> <p>He brings others elements of balance to the Obama campaign, too, shoring up weaknesses that have only become apparent over the last two months of going head-to-head with Republican opponent John McCain. Born in 1942, Biden is reassuringly old for an American electorate that would perhaps have balked at another young politician on Obama's ticket. His style of campaigning is also in stark contrast to Obama's lofty rhetoric and slightly detached intellectual feel. Biden is known as a rough-house campaigner, full of punches and jokes. He is also a formidable debater, whereas Obama's debate performances have sometimes fallen flat.</p> <p>Biden's emotional style and willingness to speak his mind have always made him popular with both core Democratic voters and the press. It is likely to help him appeal to parts of the electorate that Obama has been having trouble attracting. They include the blue-collar, working-class Democrats in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania who embraced Clinton but who have been lukewarm on Obama. Biden's straight talking and his background in Scranton, Pennsylvania, will do much to bring those voters home to Obama. Senior Democrats have flocked to praise the choice of Biden, including Hillary Clinton, whose supporters could claim she has been cruelly snubbed by Obama. </p> <p>But there are pitfalls in Obama's choice. One of those has already been shown. Republican operatives, long suspecting Biden would be the man, travelled to TV studios early yesterday morning. They were clutching their latest attack ad, which was soon hitting the airwaves via the cable news shows. It took advantage of Biden's history of speaking too freely by featuring examples of his attacks on Obama and praise for McCain. </p> <p>'There has been no harsher critic of Barack Obama's lack of experience than Joe Biden,' said McCain spokesman Ben Porritt. That summed up the main risk in choosing Biden. His tongue is notoriously loose and has left a long record. Aside from his gaffe at the start of his own presidential campaign, he has accused Obama of not being ready to be President. He also once said he was willing to run with McCain, not just against him. His jokes and comments can also stoke up fires of controversy that could distract the Obama campaign at key moments. In New Hampshire, while campaigning for votes in his own presidential campaign, Biden once remarked that 'you cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent'. Such off-the-cuff asides are perfect fodder for the ravenous 24-hour news cycle of the modern presidential campaign. They could prove to be a dangerous source of distractions in the tough weeks ahead, especially as McCain's camp will pore over his every utterance. Another problem is that Biden does not bring a swing state with him, as Indiana's Senator Evan Bayh could have done. He is also a Washington insider, which could hurt Obama's claim that he wants to change the system. Finally, choosing a man - rather than Clinton or Kansas governor Kathleen Sibelius - might aggravate women voters. </p> <p>One safe bet is that Biden's speeches will be well prepared and heavily scrutinised. That first presidential campaign in 1988 was seen as a strong one, but it foundered over accusations that he had plagiarised a speech by British Labour party leader Neil Kinnock. Biden had usually credited Kinnock in his speech, but on one occasion when he did not he was caught on video. That triggered a series of other probes into Biden's background and he withdrew from the race saying 'the exaggerated shadow' of his mistakes had come to dominate coverage of his presidential bid.</p> <p>But now Biden is back. Any career as long as his is going to have many peaks and troughs. But few would have predicted that the greatest peaks may yet still lie ahead. The Obama-Biden ticket has a strong chance to take the White House this November. If it does, as the old political maxim for running mates goes, Biden will be just a heartbeat away from the presidency.</p> <h2>Partners in power</h2> <p><strong>Men behind the throne</strong></p> <p><strong>Lyndon Johnson (1960-63)</strong><br>Running mate to John F Kennedy</p> <p>The gregarious Texan helped the young Kennedy to win the South and fought to overcome suspicions that he wanted to overshadow the President.

  "<p>\"The American dream under Bush-McCain is slipping away.\" With that, and a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93913125\">strong speech</a> connecting the Obama-Biden ticket to the mythology of the American dream, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/uselections2008.barackobama\">Joe Biden for vice president era</a> began today, on the steps of the Old Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.</p> <p>Biden - who weary Democrats found out was Barack Obama's choice for VP around 2.30am via <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQrbykB_DTXSD7LM_SS8C9KA70ZQD92NU10G0\">text message</a> - stood on stage next to Barack Obama and made it clear that he and Obama represented the interests of the great middle class. John McCain - presumably while prancing around in his $520 Italian loafers - would represent more of Bushonomics, which emphasises the all-important need for the majority of the economic benefits in our society to trickle down into the Swiss bank accounts of those poor, overtaxed millionaire chief executives throughout the land.</p> <p>Is Biden a good pick? We'll find out on November 5. But it was a helluva beginning. For if <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/08/23/biden/\">Biden brings any strengths</a> to this ticket, it is most certainly his humble roots, his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24veep.html\">foreign policy gravitas</a> and his aptitude at delivering scathing one-liners that belittle Republican politics and politicians - the latter being a skill that is lacking in too many Democrats who attempt to enter national politics. </p> <p>Biden easily delivered the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPOAKXBi9Pw\">most memorable line</a> of the presidential primaries a few months ago. Addressing Democrats during one of the debates (Biden sought the nomination before dropping out due to lack of traction), he reminded the audience that when former New York mayor and Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani spoke - a man, mind you, who has made millions off of being a 9/11 \"hero\" by virtue of being in front of the cameras that day, because he chose to place his counterterrorism headquarters in the World Trade Center, the only site previously attacked by foreign terrorists in New York - all he could manage to fit into a sentence was \"a noun, a verb and 9/11.\" </p> <p>Yes, that sound you heard was Giuliani's head snapping back from being backhanded.</p> <p>During today's speech in Springfield, Biden added another memorable line, when riffing on the recent attacks the Obama campaign has launched against the married-into-oligarchy-McCain for not knowing how many houses he has (between seven and twelve, depending upon whether individual houses on compounds count as more than one). The Delaware Democrat pointed out that while most American families sit around their kitchen table and worry about paying about the bills, McCain has to \"figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at.\"</p> <p>Although, in McCain's defense, it must be tough to think about your houses when your $270,000 per-year worth of butlers and maids are demanding their paychecks. But I digress.</p> <p>In the end, Biden will have to use his humble background, policy expertise and attack-ready soundbites to overcome the fact that he has a tendency to <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ixgPBGhWRlq7LsZ4jWZZyo7KXewgD92O6OQ01\">stick his foot in his mouth</a> now and again, not to mention the fact that he has been in Washington - although commuting homes every night to Wilmington, Delaware on the train - since all the way back when McCain was still middle aged. </p> <p>Will this be a problem? Again, we don't yet know. But what I do know, is that with Biden aboard the Obama Express, it's going to be a fun ride.</p>",

  "<p>Two boats being sailed by international peace activists on a mission to defy the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip and deliver humanitarian aid reached their destination today.</p> <p>Hundreds of Palestinians gathered to greet the group of 46 activists, who undertook the two-day journey despite Israel saying it would stop the mission, which it described as a \"provocation\".</p> <p>Earlier today, Israel said it would permit the boats to dock in Gaza after determining that they were carrying humanitarian equipment.</p> <p>Those on board accused officials of sabotaging their communications equipment.</p> <p>The mission is intended to challenge the economic blockade imposed by Israel and deliver a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons. </p> <p>The activists on the boat included an 81-year-old Catholic nun, the British journalist Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth, the sister-in-law of Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"I've been nervous, but I'm excited,\" Booth said shortly before the boats sailed. \"It's not about our fear, it's about the people waiting in Gaza - you can't think about anything else.\"</p> <p>Another passenger, Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian with Israeli and US citizenship, said: \"The siege that the Israelis have imposed on Gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law, it is also immoral. </p> <p>\"Global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Aviv Shiron, a spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, had said \"all options\" were under consideration to prevent the boats from reaching Gaza. </p> <p>An Israeli admiral issued an apparent warning to all shipping to stay clear of waters near Gaza because of an unspecified \"security situation.\"</p> <p>A standoff with the Israeli navy and the arrests of the activists if they tried to enter Gaza had been expected.</p> <p>In a statement issued as they departed yesterday, the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them. </p> <p>\"If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships, we will not forcibly resist,\" a statement said.</p> <p>\"If we are arrested and brought to Israel, we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ... it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice.\"</p> <p>Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, it still controls the strip's air and sea space as well as almost all the border crossings. </p> <p>Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas, the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the strip, saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel. </p> <p>It has imposed a tight economic blockade of Gaza, saying it wants to weaken Hamas, the Islamist group that won Palestinian elections more than two years ago.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336909636\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama ended days of speculation about his choice of running mate today, sending out an early morning message to supporters saying he had picked Joe Biden.</p> <p>Biden, 65, is the man seen as the Democrats' authority on foreign affairs.</p> <p>The voluble chair of the Senate foreign relations committee will appear with Obama for the first time later today in Springfield, Illinois, where the Democratic candidate began his run for the White House early last year.</p> <p>The pair will then set off on a lightning tour of battleground states, hoping to build up excitement about the ticket before they arrive at the Democratic convention in Denver, which gets under way on Monday.</p> <p>The choice of Biden was widely seen today as a sign that the Obama camp considered foreign policy would be an issue in the coming election against the Republican, John McCain, and that Obama could suffer from charges of inexperience.</p> <p>Unlike earlier vice presidential candidates, Biden can not deliver a key battleground state: he comes from tiny Delaware. </p> <p>After 35 years as a senator, he cannot easily deliver Obama's message of change and \u2013 perhaps most crucially \u2013 voted for the Iraq war.</p> <p>Biden could also be haunted by attacks he made on Obama earlier this year, and his plagiarism of a speech by Neil Kinnock 20 years ago, but his knowledge of national security and foreign policy apparently overrode those considerations.</p> <p>The Obama camp said as much on its website, with a message reading: \"Joe Biden brings extensive foreign policy experience, an impressive record of collaborating across party lines, and a direct approach to getting the job done.\"</p> <p>Biden reinforced his image as a wise man on foreign affairs with a trip to Georgia a week ago. </p> <p>That intervention seems to have made him the firm favourite for vice-president, elevating him from a familiar figure in Washington -where he was a regular guest on television chat shows and think tank forums - to an indispensable counsellor. </p> <p>Despite Biden's ubiquity in Washington, the Obama extracted the maximum drama with the timing of its announcement, keeping the choice under wraps until late on Friday night.</p> <p>Then, the other top contenders, Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia, and the Indiana senator Evan Bayh told reporters they would not be chosen.</p> <p>The official campaign email announcing Biden as the vice presidential pick did not go out until around 3am.</p> <p>The timing of the decision allows Obama to go into the Democratic convention on a high, rebounding from weeks of being battered by the McCain campaign as a mere celebrity figure unfit for the White House. </p> <p>Obama had a few days' grace when McCain acknowledged he could not keep track of how many houses he owned with his beer heiress wife, Cindy.</p> <p>But the Democrats are mindful that he has been on a slow downward slide in the polls all summer, in part because of the McCain attacks. The choice of Biden, with his long record, could reassure voters about Obama.</p> <p>Biden brings other gifts as a campaigner. He is combative as well as a smooth talker \u2013 a combination that could serve him well in the traditional vice-presidential role as attacker. </p> <p>He can also claim working class roots and is Catholic, which could help win over two core demographics that have so far been lukewarm to Obama.</p> <p>He is known for regularly returning by train to his native Delaware rather than spending time in Washington. One of his sons, the attorney general for Delaware, is about to be deployed to Iraq in the state national guard.</p> <p>Biden could also be an asset in trying to unite the party around Obama after the long and bruising primary battle. </p> <p>He claims credit for passing legislation against domestic violence and is firm in his support of abortion, factors that might help bring support from female Democrats.</p> <p>In an obviously co-ordinated effort, Clinton sent out an email early today praising Biden as an \"exceptionally strong, experienced leader and devoted public servant\".<br> Biden has personal understanding of what it means to be a young rising star in Washington. He was first elected to the Senate at the age of 29 as a change agent. </p> <p>Even so, he is not an entirely natural choice for a campaign predicated on change, and which has operated for more than a year as an extremely disciplined machine.</p> <p>Biden's friendliness to reporters \u2013 and his occasional use of strong language \u2013 could make for an uneasy fit with the Obama campaign's rigour about preventing leaks and staying on message.</p> <p>Quick talking has embarrassed Biden in the past. Earlier this year, when he and Obama were rivals in the race for the White House, Biden once described Obama as the \"first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\".</p> <p>Biden dropped out after the first contest in Iowa, having struggled to raise funds from gain supporters against the combined star power of Obama and Clinton. He remained neutral until the end of the primaries, unlike other candidates.</p> <p>But in the heat of the contest, Biden regularly attacked Obama for his lack of experience \u2013 comments that immediately resurfaced in Republican attack ads today. \"I would be honored to run with or against John McCain, because I think the country would be better off,\" Biden says in the old footage.</p> <p>Biden also has baggage from his first run for the White House. </p> <p>In 1988, he was forced to drop out of the race for the Democratic nomination after it was revealed he had plagiarised a famous speech by Kinnock in which he talked about how he had been the first in his family to go to university.</p>",
  "<p>In a monstrous violation of the laws of modern politics, the Obama campaign appears to have chosen, in Joe Biden, a vice-presidential candidate whose public pronouncements are occasionally actually amusing, and sometimes actually reflect what he's thinking. Naturally, this could prove ruinous \u2014 already this morning the Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/aug/23/uselections2008.barackobama\">all over</a> the Biden archive. The Obama campaign's best hope is probably that Biden has been so loose-tongued for so long that individual gaffes won't matter; it will all just seem like an appealing character trait. And of course to anyone not involved in the day-to-day control-freakery of political campaigns, it <em>is</em> an appealing character trait. For starters, here's a moment (<a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=veepstakes_the_case_for_biden\">via Ezra Klein</a>) in which a mere facial expression from Biden, right at the end of this clip, tells you all you need to know about Rudy Giuliani's foreign-policy credentials:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p7Y8AFctpjo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/p7Y8AFctpjo&color1=291787617&color2=325161297&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/p7Y8AFctpjo&color1=291787617&color2=325161297&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Some of the most serious criticisms of Biden's personal conduct have to do with his track record of borrowing speeches and \"mis-speaking\" about his past, but in <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D91F3CF931A1575AC0A961948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print\">this New York Times piece</a> \u2014 in which he apologises for claiming to have three degrees, when he only has two \u2014 the stand-out moment comes when he tells a voter in New Hampshire:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think I have a much higher IQ than you do.</p> </blockquote> <p>...which is surely the definition of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsley_gaffe\">Kinsley gaffe</a>. </p> <p>Sarcasm's not beneath him, either, as this press release from the primaries shows (via <a href=\" http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/more_republican_oppo_on_biden.php\">Marc Ambinder</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>The Biden for President Campaign today congratulated Sen. Barack Obama for arriving at a number of Sen. Biden's long-held views on combating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then there's this famous and rather excruciating moment, in which Biden, speaking with an Indian-American supporter, says: \"In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India. You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I'm not joking.\" Biden's intent is surely not racist here: his tone of voice, and choice of interlocutor, suggest he's celebrating Delaware diversity in a drily humourous way. (\"I'm not joking\" is Biden-speak for \"I am joking.\") But still, talk about a gift to your critics:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OIT3jUrNTX0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/OIT3jUrNTX0&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/OIT3jUrNTX0&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=91157&amp;title=sen.-joe-biden\">this Daily Show interview</a>, in which Jon Stewart confronts Biden with some of his more infelicitous remarks, is worth watching in full.</p> <p>And if you can make it out \u2014 the sound quality is poor \u2014 here's a moment from 2007 in which Biden tells a supporter how he'll respond when Bush tries to a veto an Iraq spending bill that would set a timetable for troop withdrawal:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're going to shove it down his throat.</p> </blockquote> <p>(There are <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGRhNzJlMWY5NjdiNzhjMTRkYjMzNjYwOGJmYzNjMTY=\" \">plenty, plenty more</a> potentially damaging Biden quotes, and we'll be hearing a lot of them from the McCain campaign in the coming days.)</p> <p>So how will all this affect the outcome of the election? As a general rule, remember: when a candidate strikes liberal journalists and commie Europeans as witty, sardonic, clever and engaging, that's always a <em>really, really good sign</em> of his electability in mainstream America.</p>",
  "<p>In the eyes of the rest of the world Great Britain remained in third place in the medal table going into the final weekend, an achievement in large part down to Dr Tim Brabants who had recorded a start to finish win in the 1,000m kayak K1 class on Friday.</p> <p>Today, the paddling Doctor attempted to double up in the 500m kayak K1 class. Looking not dissimilar to Steve Redgrave, facially and physically, he crammed into his small canoe like an outsized Dad in a dodgem. On Friday, he had started like the clappers and he started well yesterday but so did the others, in particular the favourite, and Canadian flagbearer, Adam van Koeverden, unbeaten over the distance this year.</p> <p>The race then went entirely topsy-turvy with Hungarian Akos Vereckei doing a Carlisle, coming from nowhere to first and back again in a mere fifty metres. Van Koevereden faltered, Brabants, out on his own on the far side, powered on, but quickest of all was the Australian Ken Wallace. Initially, the scoreboard flashed up that the Doctor was second before his name disappeared with van Koeverden placed in second and Brabants in bronze.</p> <p>\"When I crossed the line I didn't know where I was, no idea, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th,\" said Brabants. \"I saw it come up as second and then drop down to third but I'm still in the medals and I'm very happy.\"</p> <p>The man, who as a GP must have taken a pay-cut in accepting lottery funding, had matched his expectations. And this, considering the crazed targets medics set themselves, was a considerable achievement.</p> <p>He talked about \"going back to the day job for 18 months, back to the real world. I've been out for two years so I won't be going straight back to unsupervised work.\" Which comes as a relief, for no serious patient wants a rusty paddler fiddling with their insides. \"I'll wait until I get my skills back and feel confident and safe,\" he continued.</p> <p>After doctoring, there will be another Olympics in London. Although he admitted, \"I haven't cleared it with the wife\". Nor indeed, his coach Eric Farrell, who seemed surprised that he would not be returning to LSE Preservation, his damp-proofing business in Thames Ditton, full-time. \"I'll have a chat with him,\" he said before giving a name-check to business partner, Russell Newman, who may continue to have more work on his hands.</p> <p>Brabants, meanwhile, isn't going to sit back and limit himself to pursuing a full-time medical career and a full-on Olympic medal attempt, no that would be lazy. In the next few months he is racing over distances between 200m and 20 km. The former being the Mazda Challenge in Toronto, and the latter being a surf-ski race in Dubai with a first prize of $20,000.</p> <p>Added to all this, one doesn't want to get bored and all that, he plans to unwind with a Men's Fitness Rough Track Triathlon at Dawney, Eton.</p> <p>Physician heal thyself, the good Doctor should prescribe himself some medication to calm down. You have the key to the cabinet, use it man.</p> <p>Or at least have a decent drink. To win two individual medals is worth a holiday even if you did rather let the country down by losing to an Australian in a sitting down event. I mean, if we start losing sitting down what will happen when we have to stand up\u2026</p>",
  "<p>Conditions at Newmarket today for the re-scheduled Juddmonte International are in stark contrast to what was in store for these Group One horses at soggy York earlier this week. It should be advantage Duke Of Marmalade, whose high-class fast-ground form can give him a vital edge over the Derby winner, New Approach.</p> <p>While New Approach has plenty of form on fast ground too, a softer surface might have been better for Jim Bolger's colt on his delayed return to action. He had to miss the Irish Derby after suffering soreness in his near-hind hoof and leg muscles.</p> <p>For a horse who has had his own leg problems, <strong>Duke Of Marmalade (3.35)</strong> is remarkably effective on fast ground. He is bidding for his fifth consecutive Group One victory, which includes a resounding defeat of Phoenix Tower and Pipedreamer at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>Aidan O'Brien's four-year-old is a tremendous battler, as he showed in the King George last time, and the drop back to 10 furlongs should not be a problem, with stablemate Red Rock Canyon such an effective pacemaker.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 2.00</strong> Luca Cumani's lightly raced Credit Swap could be dangerous, but <strong>Relative Order</strong> has strong claims on his Goodwood third behind Blue Sky Basin from a bad draw.</p> <p><strong>Goodwood 2.10</strong> With Aidan O'Brien having pulled out his runners from the re-scheduled Great Voltigeur, the way looks clear for <strong>Patkai</strong> to reinforce his St Leger claims.</p> <p><strong>Beverley 2.20</strong> Though he was left standing by the well-handicapped Perks at Haydock, <strong>Drill Sergeant</strong> has a good chance of going one better. He was clear of the rest and runs off the same mark here.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 2.35</strong> See tip of the day panel.</p> <p><strong>Goodwood 2.45</strong> Tungsten Strike enjoyed an easy lead before Yeats assumed control in the Goodwood Cup and he can be picked off this time by <strong>Sanbuch</strong>, who has won on two of his three visits here.</p> <p><strong>Newmarket 3.05</strong> One of last season's fastest juveniles, <strong>Winker Watson</strong> has had his problems this year but there was a lot to like about his latest effort in the Sussex Stakes. The return to sprinting can see him back in business.</p> <p><strong>Goodwood 3.15</strong> Unless the heavens open, Bankable will surely find it hard to live with <strong>Raven's Pass</strong>, whose sights are lowered after a series of smart performances at the highest level. He was clear of the third horse when touched off by Henrythenavigator here last time.</p> <p><strong>Goodwood 3.45</strong> The form of her Newmarket win may be nothing special, but <strong>Fantasia</strong> looked a fair prospect as she drew away to win by over three lengths. An entry for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot suggests trainer Luca Cumani is hopeful she will make the grade.</p> <h2>Horse sense</h2> <br> <p>Winker team eyeing big win in Newmarket sprint</p> <p>A sparkling piece of work at Newmarket on Tuesday was proof that <strong>Winker Watson (3.05)</strong> is back in business. The return to sprinting at his local track today can see Peter Chapple-Hyam's colt victorious - he failed to stay 1m when fourth in last month's Sussex Stakes.</p> <p>Brian Meehan, who has high hopes for <strong>Gallagher</strong> in tomorrow's Prix Morny at Deauville, can take the opening race at Newmarket with <strong>Absent Pleasure (12.50)</strong>. This colt has come on a lot for his first run.</p> <p>The nursery on the Newmarket card is decidedly competitive, but the Paul Cole team expect to go close with <strong>Sultans Way (2.35)</strong>. William Muir's <strong>Defector (4.10)</strong> is reckoned capable of better than he has shown so far and there is a deal of improvement in <strong>Mawatheeq (4.45)</strong>, who travelled strongly on his Kempton debut before inexperience found him out.</p> <p>Roger Charlton sends <strong>Unbreak My Heart (2.20)</strong> to Beverley for a valuable handicap and this colt will relish the testing ground. Despite recent disappointments, there is confidence behind <strong>Hoh Mike (3.20)</strong> in the sprint.</p> <p>Frankie Dettori, who rode work for Gerard Butler at Newmarket this week, won on <strong>Pachattack (3.45)</strong> for the stable at Glorious Goodwood. He can go close again on this promising filly in today's Prestige Stakes at the Sussex track.</p> <p>Clive Cox thinks a lot of <strong>Piazza San Pietro (5.20)</strong> and his two-year-old can give Brae Hill something to think about in Windsor's opener. Jeremy Noseda's progressive <strong>Grande Annee (7.20)</strong> is fancied to defy the handicapper again.</p> <p><strong>Wikaala (2.10)</strong>, <strong>Superduper (2.45)</strong> and <strong>Quirina (3.20)</strong> are recommended on tomorrow's Goodwood card, while Luca Cumani's <strong>Riggins (5.40)</strong> is reported in good shape for his return to action at Kempton on Monday.</p> <h2>Seen and heard</h2> <br> <p><strong>Moscow's racing officials</strong> just had to grin and bear it when the first four home in last Saturday's Russian Derby were all American-bred. The Mineshaft colt Monomakh scooped the millon-rouble first prize, but the eyecatcher in fourth place was Racecar Rhapsody, who had occupied the same position behind Big Brown in the Preakness Stakes. He is now owned by Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov, who was also responsible for seventh-placed The Riddler - last seen here plying his trade on the all-weather for Jamie Osborne.</p> <p><strong>Nicky Henderson's visit</strong> to Newmarket last weekend included an early-morning stint on the gallops watching the Godolphin horses. Given the low-down by Godolphin's Diana Cooper, Henderson may well have seen some prospective jumpers in action. Newcastle's \"Fighting Fifth\" Hurdle is a long way off, but already the Henderson camp are relishing a clash between their Punjabi and Binocular, with Barry Geraghty riding Punjabi and Tony McCoy on his JP McManus-owned rival.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Joe Biden</strong></p> <p>The 65-year-old Delaware senator has, by all accounts, a superlative resum\u00e9. </p> <p>His leadership of the foreign relations committee would benefit Democrats during a presidential race that could be decided as much by Iran, Iraq, and Russia as by the US. </p> <p>Biden is a demonstrably skilled debater, his son is scheduled for a deployment to Iraq this year, and he has a palpable affection for Obama.</p> <p>Washington has produced few sparkling wits, but Biden is one of them. Only this veteran senator, first elected at the age of 30, could get a laugh just by saying: \"Yes.\" During a Democratic presidential debate in February, the famously talkative Pennsylvania native was asked whether he had the self-discipline to lead the free world, most expected one of his long-winded answers.</p> <p>But he shocked the crowd into laughter by answering: \"Yes.\" That demonstrated the self-discipline that, according to his critics, his loquaciousness undercuts.</p> <p>His drawbacks, however, go beyond his verbosity. His presidential candidacy in 1988 derailed after he admitted to plagiarising a speech by the then British Labour party leader, Neil Kinnock. </p> <p>And his long history in Washington risks undermining Obama's message of \"change\".</p> <p><strong>The other contenders:</strong></p> <p><strong>Tim Kaine</strong></p> <p>Kaine and Obama have a lot in common. Both have climbed the political ladder at an early age, spent formative years of their lives in foreign countries \u2013 and, perhaps most importantly, proven they can win over historical Republican voters.</p> <p>Kaine, 50, was elected governor of Virginia in 2005 on a solidly centrist platform that emphasised balanced budgets. </p> <p>He personally opposes capital punishment, but appealed to the state's conservative culture by promising to permit executions there.</p> <p>His bond with Obama began before he was even elected, when he invited the young senator from Illinois to campaign with him. </p> <p>The two and their wives are all graduates of Harvard law school, and Kaine's past service as a missionary in Honduras aligns him with Obama's experience of life outside the US.</p> <p>Kaine's lack of national security or foreign policy credentials has, however, already drawn fire from Republicans who anticipate his selection as the vice-presidential nominee. </p> <p>No less an arbiter of attack politics than Karl Rove maligned the Virginian as \"undistinguished\" last week, mocking his term as \"mayor of the 105th largest city in America\" (Kaine was mayor of the Virginia state capital, Richmond, from 1998 to 2000).</p> <p>But those who believe running mates can help deliver US states to a presidential candidate have often promoted Kaine, citing Obama's potential to win Virginia for a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time since 1964.</p> <p><strong>Evan Bayh</strong></p> <p>Evan Bayh is a senator for Indiana, the state his father represented in Washington for 18 years and that elected him governor at the age of 33.</p> <p>His support for the Iraq war, tax cuts and government surveillance has frustrated some liberals, who worry that his centrism would undermine the party's agenda.</p> <p>However, the 52-year-old defies easy characterisation. Although he bolstered the Bush administration's case for war, he began calling for the resignation of the then defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld less than a year after the Iraq invasion. </p> <p>While he supported the controversial Patriot Act, he voted to reject Bush appointments for attorney general and the supreme court, as well as that for the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice.</p> <p>Bayh's worth to Obama is undeniable. As an early backer of Hillary Clinton's candidacy this year, his choice as vice-president would help mollify her frustrated supporters. He is a proponent of strong sanctions on Iran, which would help Obama erase lingering concerns among hawkish Jewish voters.</p> <p>His mild-mannered personality makes him the polar opposite of the gregarious Biden. Counterintuitively, the biggest advantage Bayh brings may be his relatively unexciting image. </p> <p>His personal life holds no promise of buried scandal, and his solid senate record on almost all the key issues at play in this year's election could be just what Democrats need.</p> <p><strong>Kathleen Sebelius</strong></p> <p>The popular Kansas governor, like Kaine, would help Obama win votes in a traditionally conservative state. </p> <p>The 60-year-old has worked well with Republicans without giving ground on her support for abortion rights and gun control.</p> <p>However, nobody can say for certain whether Obama would gain a decisive advantage with women by choosing a female running mate \u2013 especially one without the surname Clinton. </p> <p>And while Sebelius's low-key style helps her bond with political opponents, her easygoing rebuttal to George Bush's state of the union speech this year left many Democratic activists unimpressed.</p> <p>Obama and Sebelius have displayed a personal bond on the campaign trail, and his family's roots in Kansas could help the pair craft a powerful narrative to appeal to the US heartland. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sebelius holds more obvious risks as a running mate than the three white males also considered finalists for the vice-presidency.</p> <p><strong>Chet Edwards</strong></p> <p>Chet Edwards, a nine-term congressman from Texas, has attracted less buzz but enjoys the backing of one of the most powerful politicians in the US. </p> <p>\"I hope he will be the nominee,\" the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told ABC television earlier this month. \"I just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of Chet Edwards.\" </p> <p>The congressman said he had been vetted for a place on the ticket.</p>",
  "<p>In US popular mythology, presidential running mates tend to be viewed as the ultimate accessory. </p> <p>At best, aspiring vice presidents flatter the candidate's strengths and lend extra panache. However, the wrong choice can leave voters wondering: \"What was he thinking?\"</p> <p>Not every running mate bemoaned the post as \"the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived\", as John Adams put it, or worse than \"a pitcher of warm piss\" in the famous words of Franklin D Roosevelt's vice-president, John Nance Garner.</p> <p>In fact, some vice presidents have gone down in US history as more politically skilful than the commanders in chief they served under. </p> <p>Richard Nixon led cabinet meetings on behalf of president Dwight Eisenhower, while Lyndon Johnson boasted legislative savvy that the younger John F Kennedy could not match.</p> <p>Then there is Dick Cheney, whose unprecedented control over decision-making in George Bush's White House gives liberals worldwide the jitters. </p> <p>But where does Cheney rank in the canon? Here, we present the best and worst running mates in US history.</p> <h2>The top five</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336869564\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/ljp.jpg\" alt=\"Lyndon B Johnson\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Bob Daugherty/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Daugherty/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1) Lyndon Johnson</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> John F Kennedy<br><strong>What he brought:</strong> Johnson, the gregarious Texan leader of senate Democrats, helped young Kennedy win the south and fought to overcome suspicions that he wanted to overshadow the president.

Burr promptly challenged Hamilton to a duel and killed him.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Helped popularise the phrase \"pistols at dawn\".</p> <p><strong>2) Spiro Agnew</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> Richard Nixon<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Agnew was hailed as a regional balancer, giving Nixon an advantage in the south, but their relationship turned sour. The president all but abandoned Agnew and helped force him from office after he was charged with tax evasion and money laundering.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Became a target of good satire on TV shows The Simpsons, Angel, and The Wonder Years.</p> <p><strong>3) Dan Quayle</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> George HW Bush<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Quayle's penchant for gaffes became a national punchline, particularly his insistence at a grammar school spelling bee that \"potatoe\" was a word and his decision to blame rising urban violence on popular TV character Murphy Brown, a single mother.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Made an excellent Doonesbury character.</p> <p><strong>4) John Tyler</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> William Henry Harrison<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> When Harrison suddenly died days after taking office, leaving the White House to Tyler, his potential seemed great. But the lanky vice-president proved a poor diplomat, earning him the nickname \"His Accidency\" and expulsion from his own party.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Successfully annexed Texas.</p> <p><strong>5) Hannibal Hamlin</strong><br><strong>Presidential partner:</strong> Abraham Lincoln<br><strong>His fatal problems: </strong> Hamlin's choice to lead the Union army during the US civil war ended up losing badly and he was perennially eclipsed by the iconic president. Things got so bad that Lincoln jettisoned Hamlin in 1864 in favour of Andrew Johnson \u2013 who was later impeached.<br><strong>Redeeming quality: </strong> Marvellously alliterative name.</p>",
  "<p><br>The playwright-director Anthony Neilson, an advocate of the collaborative process. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</p> <p>How sacred is a playwright's work? It is often argued that writers are <a href=\"http://mrexcitement.blogspot.com/2007/04/richard-nelsons-address-to-artny.html\">under attack</a>. And bloggers this week have been revisiting the fraught question of how much control directors and actors should have over the scripts they work on. The discussion was kicked off by Patrick on the <a href=\"http://backstageat.backstagejobs.com/?p=197\">Backstage blog</a>. Talking of seeing the writer <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horton_Foote\">Horton Foote</a> being interviewed about his work, he was struck by Foote's attitude towards those that produce his work: \"[He] talks only to the director about the direction and acting of the production. He does not give actor notes to the actors, though he will answer any questions they ask him. If he does not agree with a particular choice, he will mention it to the director. That is as far as he goes. He lets the director make the final decisions about the production. For him, it is an honour to see his work onstage. He enjoys watching each interpretation of his work, and said that he learns from each performance.\"</p> <p>This leads Patrick on to question the attitudes of other writers toward what they produce: \"Are today's new playwrights so perfect that changing a single word in a script will throw the play in an entirely different direction? Is every word in a work of art never to be changed regardless of the discovered realities of actually putting it on the stage? Or are these playwrights so insecure about their writing that they fear the intended story will be lost if a single 'i' has its dot removed?\"</p> <p>This assumption that, in creative terms, the playwright should always reign supreme is something that the writer <a href=\"http://jayraskolnikov.blogspot.com/2008/08/tides.html \">Jay Raskolnikov</a> is not happy with either. Speaking of the fact that theatre contracts in America often stress that the playwright has, in principle, authority to approve almost every aspect of a show, he argues that \"the Dramatists Guild would have you think, [writers] are the focal point of the creation of theatre. Everything onstage is their vision and everything is subservient to the writer ... Writers are no more creative than any other artist. They have different inputs. They have different outputs. But no matter how great a script may be, an audience will probably never enjoy a night at the theatre without the production coming alive - off the page. No production will be great without both halves working together in sync.\"</p> <p>In one respect, Raskolnikov is absolutely right. And the creation of plays here in Britain is increasingly becoming a much more collaborative process. Anthony Neilson works with his actors to make his plays, John Tiffany and Gregory Burke worked together to make Black Watch, and Simon Stephens, in his new play Pornography, has gone so far as to say in the opening stage directions: \"This play can be performed by any number of actors. It can be performed in any order.\"</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/playwrights-gratefulness-control-of-their-work.html\">Parabasis</a> firmly disagrees with both Raskolnikov and the Backstage blog. He argues that \"there's a curious leap in logic here between writers insisting very firmly on strict adherence to a very broad concept of authorial intent and treating their collaborators as enemies and actually changing the words of their plays.\" To do the latter, he says, is inexcusable and can become a kind of censorship: \"It's not hard to imagine a world where a theatre would clean up the language of a play to appease a funder or cut a gay love scene or some such thing.\" I agree that any censorship like this would be wrong. But are there not times when flaws in a play could be polished or eliminated? <a href=\"http://devilvet.blogspot.com/2008/08/man-them-playwrights-sure-can-get.html\">Devilvet suggests</a> a series of scenarios in which it might be acceptable to make alterations, though Parabasis argues that none of them would justify making changes.</p> <p>The point, ultimately, is that playwrights consent to having their words changed all the time - though this almost always happens during the rehearsal process for a new play. And if a director wants to change something in an extant play and the writer is still alive there is nothing to stop them from asking. The irony, though, is, as Parabasis points out, that when it comes to Shakespeare, you frequently \"have to cut, alter and bastardize the already not-necessarily-definitive texts of his plays\". Paradoxically, he concludes: \"We are in fact way more 'disrespectful' of the classics than we are of contemporary plays in terms of textual fidelity.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Alan will be here from 2.00am...</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Like a bumper sack of Christmas presents, Beijing has held us rapt for the best part of a fortnight now, but there's still some fun to be had at the 29th Olympiad. <strong>Wee Tom Daley</strong> will be showcasing the talent that British football missed out on in the diving; <strong>the good doctor Tim Brabants</strong> is off in the kayaking at 8.30am - prescription: more gold; there'll be a further chances to cover ourselves in relay glory with some <strong>4x400m baton juggling for both the men and the women</strong> in the Bird's Nest; and <strong>Lisa Dobriskey</strong> will attempt to add to <strong>Team GB's pot o'gold</strong> in the 1500m. There's also a bauble up for grabs in the men's footie, so I'm told. All of which means another glorious date in MBM history, folks - why not be a part of it? Go on. Please...</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.10am:</strong> Have you read the preamble? Ah, you have. Well ... Did I mention the football? That's on in a couple of hours. Alright, three. Currently, all I can enlighten you about is women's handball and men's hockey - 7-8th and 11-12th classification matches, respectively. I know, you're on tenter hoo... yada, yada.</p> <p>Still, handball, eh.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.15am:</strong> It's 1-1 in that crucial fight for 11th place in the hockey. China and South Africa are scrapping for the honour of finishing bottom and not-bottom. I'm not really sure about the handball, other than that Sweden and Romania are the nations doing the handling...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.25am:</strong> Huzzahs! We've got some yelpin' 'n' kickin' over in the Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium (BSaTUG). Malaysia's Chew Chan Che has just bashed seven bells out of Uzbekistan's Evgeniya Karimova in the Taekwondo women's 67kg preliminary. The BSaTUG crowd loved that.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> Thirty-two medals up for vending today, the second busiest of the Games. Not that you'd know it right now. Ecuador - Australia up next in kick-scream-dance-fall over. Taekwondo combatants look a bit like rappers about go head to head in a battle, to me, bouncing back and forth on the balls of their feet before ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK. Gangsta rap's probably less violent though.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.37am: Word from our BBC spies.</strong> \"The Beeb reports that the 'pageant of Britishness' we will be treated to tomorrow is set to feature none other than a Privet Hedge!\" says 'Grey Squirrel' Oliver Pattenden. \"What more appropriate way is there to welcome the entire world to enjoy our culture, than to present them with the staunchly vigilant and rather stoic shrub we employ to tell everyone else to mind their own business.\" Yes, a shrubbery, that's what we want. Will there be some curtain-twitching too? And maybe some lessons on the Empire - may its sun never set...</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.43am:</strong> The Taekwondo-ers (proper name, anyone?) are stalking each other like two ginormous, springy preying mantises (manti?). Aus have kicked ass, and the victorious girl is being led off by an attendant with a flag, presumably to her quarter-final fate. Cue some cheesy Europap in the stadium...</p> <p>Brazil v Greece next.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.50am:</strong> Has anyone else noticed the egregious use of ear-bleed dance music in the various stadia in Beijing? It's as if the organisers got sent a crate load of Sash, DJ Otzi, et al, and told \"this is what Westerners like...\" 0-0 after the first round in the Taekwondo.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.53am: Wee Tom Daley's off in the Water Cube soon</strong>, although even he doesn't rate his chances: \"I don't think I'll get anywhere near a medal.\" Glad I'm up for this then. Moments of the Games, people? Daley throwing the evil eye Blake Aldridge's way after their synchronised bombing...?</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.58am:</strong> It's bright and sunny in the 'jing as Clare Balding kicks of the Beeb's coverage for the morning. \"If Taekwondo were a movie, it would be called 'Carry On Screaming'.\" Arf, arf. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> is your one to cheer for today. And, with all the fuss about Wee Tom Daley, I forgot to mention that <strong>Pete Waterfield actually qualified 4th for the diving semis</strong>... so maybe he is worth staying up for.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.03am:</strong> Daley says \"Brilliant!\" more often than the character called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fastshow/characters/brilliant.shtml\">Brilliant from the Fast Show</a>. And Leon 'Holy Moly' Taylor - Waterfield medal-winning partner from Athens - has got a mic in his hand and, unfortunately, he's not afraid to use it.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.06am:</strong> I'll be relying on the steady hand of Bob Ballard to guide us through this, because I have absolutely no idea what the jings is going on - and Taylor is about as helpful as brail.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.11am:</strong> Now that's a question: commentator of the Games? Hugh Porter from the cycling? Gary Richardson for his stalwart interviewing/interrogating? Jackson and Johnson doubling teaming - in a nice, clean way - up in the athletics tower? This is one that could rumble on and on... (MBMer plants riff, shuts his eyes, and hopes it will grow)</p> <p><strong>Team GB</strong> Tom Daley has just flipped his way into the pool like a young Jimminy Cricket to score 71.40 for his first dive.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.15am: Team GB</strong> Pete Waterfield's abs have just chucked themselves off the board. \"That's the best three and a half pike we've seen,\" gurgles Taylor. Three nines give Waterfield 81 points and second place... until some Russian geezer gets 88 one jump later and leapfrogs his way to the top.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.20am:</strong> Daley's in 15th, but there are five rounds still to go. Taylor reckons seventies won't cut it, though. Even if you \"look like an angel and dive like a swallow\". Not my words, Clare Balding's. Excuse me while I scratch my head for some time.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.23am:</strong> My tip here is to look for the splash on entry into the water (I lied earlier when I said I knew nothing - this is \"Britain's most popular newspaper website\"* after all). The bigger the splash, the lower the score. But then, as you're reading about the diving, rather than watching it, I guess such pithy wisdom is wasted on you. Gah.</p> <p>*copyright: Big Paper</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.25am:</strong> A Belorussian nearly brains himself on the platform as he dives, and then Daley's up again. And I have to retract my mocking of Balding (surely not in the running in our broadcaster awards - nudge, nudge), because that was certainly swallow-like. Only 3.0 difficulty though, so those eights are only worth 72 to Wee Tom.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.30am:</strong> More sage advice for the ingenu diving-watcher: you don't want to get a bit \"banana man\" when you hit the water, says Taylor. Bending = bad, then. But if you throw up \"naff all\" splash, like the Chinese diver just did, then you're doing alright. See, solid Rebranded Website advice backed up by Chief Diving Wonk, Leon Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.33am: Team GB</strong> Wakefield, whose abs you could probably play skiffle on, is suffering with injections in his shoulder, but he manages a hand-stand before plunging pool-ward. Not so point-worthy this time - just 72 for Abs Waterfield.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.35am:</strong> Predictably the Chinese are first and second. Abs is 9th with Wee Tom down in 16th. Only the top twelve go through to the final later today.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.40am:</strong> Venezuala are getting another kicking over in the Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Stevenson</strong> will be getting her yell on in about 10 minutes. Plenty of splish-splosh back at the diving, with a Canadian athlete whirring like a Roman candle on his way down. The suicidal Belorussian makes too much splosh this time, so no big score for him.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.43am: Wee Tom goes with 3.2 difficulty this time...</strong> and it's good, coos Taylor. Apparently, even though Wee Tom didn't hit the water quite vertical, he used his skill to keep the splash down. What a champ.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.46am:</strong> China's Huo Liang is that good that Taylor's forced to bring out his chuckle. This kid is running away with it - and we're only in the semi.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Stevenson, Britain's best-known Taekwondo athlete</strong> - truly some distinction - has trooped out onto the mat. She has a tough draw against Jordan's Nadin Dawani, though.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.50am: Team GB</strong> Waterfield notches a solid 70. He should be good for the final at this rate. Stevenson slaps a foot into the Jordanian, and she's 2-1 up after round one. She's been given one of those half penalty points though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.51am:</strong> Having said that, Waterfield is only 12th... and he's keeping Wee Tom, who's 13th, out of the final currently.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.54am: Jingoism jingle.</strong> \"I'm sure when I went to bed at close of business last night the GB Super Team had just been overtaken in the medal table by those uber-scary, dark and menacing Ruskies,\" Jerusalems David Lloyd from Beijing. \"It's odd that 2 weeks ago we'd all have given anything to be doing as well as are now, and yet I now find myself even more urgently refreshing the Guardian blog just to ensure that we remain in 3rd ahead of those troublesome, lesser little sporting nations such as Russia. Anyway, any idea where this 18th Gold of ours suddenly materialise from?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">This</a> should suffice, David.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.59am: Team GB</strong> Don't worry, those Russians have got no chance. \"Phenome-Tom\" has just bashed 86.40 out in the diving, and Sarah Stevenson has scrapped her way into the next round of the 67kg Taekwondo. TEAM GB! TEAM GB! TEAM GB!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.03am:</strong> It certainly is noticeable how expectations have changed in the last week. As we've crept up the table, we've become less and less concerned with putting in a good effort, and more about beating those Aussie/Ruskie/German b*stards just below. In the interests of managing expectations, though, I should point out that Sarah Stevenson's reward for yelling louder than her opponent in the Taekwondo is a shout-off against the reigning Olympic champion.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>4.05am: Team GB diving</strong> Waterfield nails his effort as well, picking up a cool 90 points. Looking good for Abs, despite his being \"an old man\", according to motormouth Taylor.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>4.09am:</strong> Let's raise that bar, fellow Bulldogs. What's one more former colony between sporting rivals? Or, as Oliver Pattenden puts it: \"What do you mean we've become more concerned with beating the bastards below? USA's not that far away you know.\" Yes, yes... and Uncle Sam has been pretty feeble this time around. They'll be on their knees by 2012, surely...?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4.13am:</strong> Taylor and Ballard are prattling on like a pair of washerwomen. Abs and Wee Tom are 7th and 9th after the fourth set of dives - two more to go, I think. Taylor is definitely the most annoying speakbox the BBC have chosen to employ - even more so than Hyperactive Matt 'HOIME' Baker.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> Daley picks up nines for a score of 89, and Taylor is getting all bombastic. He... thinks... if... he... speaks... slower... it... makes... him... sound... more... author-ta-tive.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.20am</strong> \"I never thought I'd say this but we have to be thankful for an Aussie gold - pole vaulter Steve Hooker beat Evgeny Lukyanenko and kept the Russians below us on the table.\" So says a Pommie Barsteward from northern Straya. And he's <a href=\"http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/AT/C92A/ATM072000.shtml\">right</a> you know - the last medal of Friday. Abs has just made a RIGHT RICKETT of his dive!!! Taylor groans like it's enema time. Fours for our boy...</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.25am: Team GB diving</strong> Daley's in 6th now, but Waterfield has plummeted to 13th. He's just four points behind the guy in 12th, so all is not lost... but he's made a rod for his own back there.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4.28am:</strong> It's 1-1 between Japan and the puny US - the only country to stand between us and China at the top of the medal table - in the baseball. You'd think with exclusive access to the 'World Series', the Yanks might do a bit better, really.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.31am: Wee Tom wrinkles his nose like a church mouse</strong>, but that dive should be good enough. Only 60-odd... but Ballard reports that the little tyke has a 'Q' by his name, so he's definitely qualified. Splendid.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.34am:</strong> We're getting to the crunch now, dear reader(s). Can baldy Pete 'Stock Aitken' Waterfield make it through...?</p> <p>Football final soon. Argentina (current champeens) v Nigeria (who won it in 96). Grrrr</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.37am: Ballard reckons Waterfield needs mid-eighties...</strong> the 3.8 degree of difficulty results in a bit of a splash. He's scored 76, but this is the sharp end and that mightn't be good enough.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.40am:</strong> And do you know who the Super Eagles beat in Atlanta? Yup, twas the Albicelestes. Should be a good one, this. Things not looking good for Waterfield, meanwhile.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.42am:</strong> Tough break for Waterfield, he misses out by less than six points, finishing 13th. Wee Tom, the cheeky little blighter who's charmed us all*, finished eighth, and is through to this afternoon's final. He dived well, snide giggling aside, and kept his composure despite being right on the cusp going into that semi.</p> <p>*If he hasn't charmed you in particular, kindly keep it you yourself, like a good patriot</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.50am: The Germans, another nation straggling in our glorious wake, have picked up gold in the women's cross country cycling.</strong> Russia collect a meaningless bronze. You need GOLDs now, Uncle Vanya, y'hear? We're back to the hinterland of obscure Olympic events now. It's a choice of Taekwondo, Table Tennis repeats, or... Team GB hockey's titanic struggle for 5th against Korea. I'm torn.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.55am: It's Chiles play over in the National Stadium.</strong> Time for the football, ladies and gents. GB 0-0 Korea, in the men's hockey, if you're in. Opinions on the man redefining ubiquitous, Adrian Chiles?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>5.00am:</strong> Plenty of Premier League interest here, with Javier Mascherano in blue and white and Victor Anichebe, who missed an absolute sitter in the semi, on the bench for Nigeria. The Everton striker did <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=zdm8tIgNXrY\">score in the group stage though</a>. Barca's Lionel Messi should be the star of today's show however.</p> <p><strong>GB 2-1 Korea in the hockey.</strong> Whoop whoop!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.05am:</strong> Decent penalty shout for Sergio Aguero, but that would have been harsh on Nigeria. Sublime ball from Messi to set the Atletico Madrid striker through.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.07am:</strong> Argentina have settled quickly, but Nigeria have a free-kick some 40 yards out. \"Has Chiles redefined 'ubiquitous' to mean 'underwhelmingly mediocre'?\" Ollie Pattenden with that poser. Keeper saves comfortably for Argentina.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.11am</strong> Nigeria aren't too shabby on the ball themselves, but Riquelme and Messi are seeing plenty of the play. Great run from Di Maria before he's brought down on the edge of the box... Riquelme drifts a disappointing effort over though.</p> <p>It's now 3-1 in the hockey, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>5.14am:</strong> Nice interchange on the right of the area, but Okoronkwo can only blaze well over. Bit more composure required there, reckons Leroy Rosenior.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.17am:</strong> Gago and Mascherano are happy to break up play and look for their team-mates breaking ahead of them. Mad Masch plays a delightful dink into the right channel... only for it to bounce of the back of Riquelme's head. Doh</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5.18am:</strong> Messi sidesteps on the edge of the 18-yard box, but the Nigerians close him down and he can't find Aguero. Seconds later, Aguero is denied by a brilliant sliding challenge as he attacks the box from the left.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.20am: Team GB hockey</strong> The Brit lads are tearing Korea apart, Jonty Clarke adding a fourth and his second. 4-1</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.22am:</strong> Okoronkwo almost finds the delightfully-named Promise Isaac in the box, but a position of more than a little promise comes to nothing. Argentina look menacing, but are yet to have a clear sight of goal.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.25am:</strong> As the sound of the brass band floats across the stadium Messi sidles his way into the area again... and is brought down, surely. The ref's having none of it though.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.27am:</strong> Looped cross from Ebenezer Ajilore and Odemwingie can only send his header onto the roof of the net. More good work from the African side, as Victor Obinna lashes one from distance. Straight at Romero between the Argentinian sticks.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> I think it's 4-2 in the hockey at half time. And Nigeria were one well-executed back heel from playing Obinna through one-on-one. Odemwingie thens crashes a bit of a sighter wide of the right-hand upright.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.33am:</strong> They're all having a drink now, which seems a bit village green. And we're back...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.36am:</strong> Aguero takes a superb touch in the area, but is adroitly ushered away from goal. Nigeria look pretty well-marshalled at the back to me.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.38am:</strong> Oh... Oooooh! Odemwingie powers past his man and drills a ball across the face of goal, which no one can get a touch on. The ball is cleared, but then returned to the goalmouth and Isaac is surprised to find it ricochet off his body and safely into Romero's arms. A simple tap-in, that's how Leroy Rosenior saw it.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.41am:</strong> Nigeria are having their best passage of play and Argentina's superstars can't get a foot on the ball. But will they live to rue that miss from Isaac?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.44am:</strong> Aguero's cross nearly finds Di Maria at the back post, but it's successfully, if a little streakily, cleared. Mascherano then booms a 30-yarder vaguely in the direction of the goal.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>5.48am:</strong> We've got a bronze medal match between China and Cuba in the women's volleyball underway elsewhere, as well as plenty of Taekwondo. <strong>Team GB's Sarah Stevenson</strong> went through earlier, and you can read about it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicstaekwondo\">here</a>. In the fussball, Ambruse Vanzekin just manages to tip Di Maria's drive around his post. Nearly caught out there, was the Nigerian keeper.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>5.50am:</strong> Bit of Argie-bargie between the sides as the half-time whistle goes. An excellent block from Dele Adeleye prevented Argentina getting near the goal moments beforehand. All square, 0-0.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>5.56am:</strong> Unnervingly media-savvy Tom Daley looks Bob Ballard in the eye, winks, and admits that he's \"brushed away some of the cobwebs\" with that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.britisholympicteam3\">semi-final performance</a>. Selected soundbites thereafter: \"Everything's been good [in Beijing] times ten...\"; \"Anything can happen in an Olympic final...\"; \"[Pete Wakefield] should have been in that final but it's unfortunate that he didn't dive that well...\" [pulling no punches there]; \"I'm going in hoping for a really good performance, but not expecting anything...\" Well, good luck to the wee bairn, of course. TEAM GB! and all that.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.06am:</strong> Still waiting for the lads to come out for the second half. 8-4 to the US in the baseball, the Americans homing in on the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.10am:</strong> Vanzekin bravely denies the onrushing Aguero as we get back underway. This could be decide by just the one score, as happened four years ago.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.14am:</strong> Messi drives left-footed across the goal from 25-yards, forcing Vanzekin to punch away. Obinna then becomes the first player in the referee's book for a clumsy challenge on right-back Ezequiel Garay.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.16am:</strong> There's a real African atmosphere inside the National Stadium, according to the boys from the Beeb. Argentina clearly have a bit more finesse about them, but Nigeria are hustling and harrying well.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.19am:</strong> Leroy Rosenior is stretching the impartiality a bit here. Still claiming he didn't see the Messi penalty from the first half. Argentina probe again, but there's a bit of a lull to proceedings currently.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.20am: GOAL! Nigeria 0-1 Argentina</strong> After all that, a wonderful finish breaks the deadlock. Messi splits the Nigerian back line and Angel Di Maria sprints through and then produces a sublime chip to defeat Vanzekin, who probably came off his line to early. Great strike still.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.25am:</strong> The Nigerians look a little stunned by that goal, and have retreated into their shell. Messi's twinkling around the danger area... but it's the Super Eagles who have the next effort, Obinna dribbling a shot straight at Romero. Time for Anichebe.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.27am:</strong> And Anichebe nearly makes a decisive first touch! Great low cross from the right, and the Everton striker's effort is bundled around the post from close range. The corner leads to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>6.30am:</strong> Yellow card for Onyekachi Apam as he clatters Di Maria. Riquleme's whipped strike from the dead ball is deflected off for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6.34am:</strong> Just under 20 minutes for Nigeria to conjure something or it's going to be second-place silver. John Allen in Singapore is looking at Benfica's Angel Di Maria with his most optimistic hat on: \"Blimey, that was a delightful finish from the lad. I wonder if Leicester City have sent the scouts along. Here's hoping.\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>6.36am:</strong> Di Maria's obviously heard that Leicester might be looking at him... he's just been booked for tugging back an opponent.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> Drama in the Argentina penalty area as both Odemwingie and Ekpo fail to get a touch on the ball as it squirts in front of goal. Messi then does his thing at the other end and almost plays in Aguero... and Pablo's Zabaleta's cross is scrambled away by Vanzekin moments later.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>6.41am:</strong> Kaita's snap shot flies just over, but the keeper hasn't had to work for that. Jose Sosa replaces Aguero for the Albicelestes.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>6.45am:</strong> It's getting a little niggly, both Monzon and Riquelme booked for time wasting. Nigeria look like their luck's run out here.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>6.47am:</strong> Romero makes a crucial block from Anichebe, who's been a nuisance in the box since coming on.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>6.50am:</strong> Angel Di Maria has been stretchered off, apparently due to the heat. This one's winding down and the Argentinians are only too pleased. Both teams seem pretty drained.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>6.53am:</strong> Messi scoots off with the ball and then wins a free-kick deep in Nigeria's half. We're into added time... of which there will be five minutes! Where's that come from? Still hope for the Africans.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>6.58am:</strong> Okonkwo balloons one high and wide, but there was little on for the Nigerian. And Lavezzi wins a free-kick right in the corner for the South Americans... the ball's been pumped long though. To no avail. We're over 95 minutes now.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>7.00am: Argentina win the gold medal</strong> and they did enough to retain their Olympic title. Messi, whom everyone agrees was the difference between the sides, looks pretty chuffed - but Chilesy is not happy with the amount of Mexican waves going on in the stands. Tsk, lugubrious Baggies, eh...</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>7.03am: We won the men's hockey 5-2 as it turned out.</strong> It was coming up to full time when I thought things were only halfway through. Fifth place and all the glory that comes with it to Team GB. Stunning.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7.10am:</strong> Well folks, there's another day of BOUNDLESS GLORY ahead for Team GB.<strong> The good doctor Brabants is next on the card in the K1 500m</strong>, although he's not off for about an hour. <strong>Lucy Wainwright</strong> will be going for metal of some colour in the women's event. We've also got <strong>Oliver Beckingsale and Liam Killeen</strong> in the men's mountain biking. Some <strong>4x400m</strong> shenanigans later on too. Thoughts and digressions, guardianistas, please.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>7.20am:</strong> Hungary are 15-14 up against Korea in the women's handball bronze medal match. And China have snaffled another medal, bronze this time, in the volleyball, seeing off Cuba.</p> <p>John Allen's still mulling the possibility of Argentinian match winner Angel Di Maria turning out for the Foxes, meanwhile: \"Di Maria better be back at the Walkers for our game against Tranmere this afternoon. And Singapore TV has gone back to ping pong, it doesn't get much worse than this.\"</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>7.25am:</strong> Handball appears to a cross between American football, basketball, and rugby. I have no idea how the rules work. I can however watch instant replays of eveything by virtue of the fact that the BBC's web feed is a bit behind Eurosport's coverage. Double confusion. Hun 18-17 Kor</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>7.28am:</strong> 18 apiece now. So far, I'd say it's not as fun to watch as volleyball, which can be brilliantly bananas, but a fair bit better than dressage, which seems an incomprehensible waste of a horse's good time. Lot's of running into each other... and then BAM!, the Koreans hit the post.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>7.30am:</strong> Korea whack one in off the crossbar, but the Hungarians pull things level... only to fall behind and then equalise again. Norway and Russia will contest the gold medal match at 8.45am. Go Norway!</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>7.34am:</strong> John, our man in Singapore, has joined me in ignorance. \"We're onto the women's handball here now. I haven't a clue what is going on, mind you, but I just can't handle any more table tennis! Does anyone know the rules? All I can figure out for myself is that jumping is encouraged.\" Jumping does certainly seem to be encouraged. It's one of those sports where the teams continually trade the advantage, too, indicative of a fatal (boring) flaw in the scoring system, I say. Kor 22-22 Hun</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.40am:</strong> Submissions for most baffling sport of the Games? Handball is vaguely confusing, but I think it can be beaten. I have no idea how a lot of the gymnastics is rated; judo seems fairly bewildering too. Korea have sneaked ahead 26-25... but Hungary have a penalty, which looks a lot like a free goal to me. 26-26. Hockey? That has some weird rules.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>7.44am:</strong> Apart from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/23/olympics2012.olympics20082\">army of buffoons doubtless preparing for tomorrow's caper</a>, there's sod all appears to be happening in Beijing. Well, there's probably some human rights being oppressed somewhere too*. One of the Koreans has just floated a deft lob over the keeper... but it's off the post. And there also appears to have been a couple of sending-offs. Kor 29-27 Hun</p> <p>*This is mere idle speculation and not a statement of fact</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>7.49am:</strong> Hungary are hurting from that double two-minute suspension I mentioned earlier - yes, I did - and they've slipped to a three-point deficit. The Koreans can smell that rusty third-place medal... 30-27</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>7.52am: Bamboozled by Beijing.</strong> Welcome to the MBM Barry Hawthorne, who provides a welcome distraction from the handball. \"I know you Brits are really good at that Velodrome stuff, but what are the rules concerning that pursuit race? Why do they have to play a 'cat and mouse' race?\" Hmmm, well, I think it's mainly because if one of 'em goes charging off, they'll get knackered pronto, and lose, Bazza... Personally I found the Madison more difficult to work out. And we didn't come up with the goods in that one.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.00am:</strong> I think the Koreans won that 33-28. It became a bit of a blood bath at the end. <strong>Bronze goes to Korea, then.</strong> After such a MASSIVE, MASSIVE game, I am well and truly spent. Luckily, I can pass on the baton, in best Team GB style, to the one and only Mr Barry Glendenning. And be warned, <strong>don't get him started on nouns being used a verbs...</strong></p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.01am:</strong> [brief and unedifying scrabble on the floor for MBM schedule and preparatory notes ensues]</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.09am:</strong> Good morning everyone. Alan's correct - you won't hear the word \"medal\" used as a verb on my watch. I think I saw my colleague Sean Ingle commit this crime against literacy in the newspaper yesterday or the day before and he'll be feeling the back of my hand when he gets home from Beijing, unless the Chinese government intern him and all the other journalists who've been committing it in \"re-education camps\" for a couple of years. The only Briton I can think of who's \"meddled\" in the Far East in recent years is Gary Glitter, and the less said about him, the better.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.27pm:</strong> Sorry about that. I've just been fielding a phone call from Sean Ingle. Imagine how much longer it would have been if he'd read that last entry.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>8.29am: Men's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Tim Brabant</strong> In Lane 1, Tim Brabants gets off to a flyer and is in second place at the halfway mark. Australia's Ken Wallace gets the gold medal, Adam van Somebodyorother from Canada gets second, despite having had a huge lead at the halfway stage and Tim Brabants gets the bronze for Great Britain. Dr Brabant has brought Great Britain's medal's tally to a whopping 45.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.37am:</strong> Officially, there's a photo-finish in the Kayak race, but I'm pretty sure it'll be as you were at 8.29am ... except I hope to find out the Canadian's surname at some point in the near future.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.42am:</strong> Still no sign of the official result of the Men's Kayak K1 500m final. They must have used one of those cameras you see in westerns, where an old bloke holds a flash in one hand before ducking under a cloth hanging down the back.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.44am:</strong> \"Brabant should know that bronzing for us isn't good enough, Team GB expects athletes to gold every time,\" writes Oliver Pattenden, committing further crimes against the English language. The old photographer has emerged from the dark room and the official result of the men's Kayaking K1 500m final is in: Gold: Ken Wallace (Australia). Silver: Adam van Koeverden (Canada). Bronze: Tim Brabants (Great Britain).</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.50pm:</strong> It's the women's +67kg Taekwondo quarter-finals and Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson is up against the unbeaten double Olympic champion China's Chen Zong. With it being an event with judges featuring a Chinese athlete, it should go without saying that Stevenson is losing - she's 1-0 down in the third round and is getting increasingly frustrated with the judges.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.54am:</strong> For the second time in 24 hours, a Briton is <em>robbed</em> in the Taekwondo. With the last kick of the contest, Stevenson got a clean kick on Chen Zong's head, which would have earned her two points and victory. She appealed for the points, the judges had a pow-wow and then didn't give it to her. That is an unbelievable travesty.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.56am:</strong> Despite being a victim of an outrageous injustice, Sarah Stevenson is fairly calm in her post-bout interview - that is to say, she's a lot calmer than I would be if I'd just come a cropper in a similar fashion. In the BBC studio, Clare Balding and Adrian Chiles are absolutely outraged. For reasons I don't understand, Stevenson still has a <em>slim</em> chance of getting to fight for bronze in the repechage. If she has to fight a Chinese in it, she might as well not turn up.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.09am:</strong> Tim Brabants is being interviewed after \"thirding\" in the Kayaking. He's thanking everyone at home for all the support and saying it'll be \"easy to go back home and be Dr Tim again because nobody ever recognises me.\" Meanwhile, this from Gary Naylor: \"Like JPR Wiliams stitching his own face at half-time, does Dr Brabants get to do his own drug test?\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.12am:</strong> Bad news for Great Britain - Russia have just passed them in the medals table. The Brits need another gold quickly, but they're not going to get one in the men's mountain biking, where France's Julien Absalon, the defending champion and four times world champion, is winning at his leisure. He's being followed by another Frenchman, Jean-Christophe Peraud, while Switzerland's Nino Schurter is coming third. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen and Oliver Beckingsale will be giving interviews afterwards in which they'll tell us what a great experience they've had and how much it'll stand to them for London 2012. Whatever ...</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.20am: Women's Kayak K1 500m final featuring Great Britain's Lucy Wainwright.</strong> Wainwright in Lane 8 misses the jump badly and is well down at the halfway mark. She doesn't finish in the medals, but it's another photo finish which is won by Inna Osypenko-Rodomska from the Ukraine, with Italy finishing second and Germany third. Wainright was seventh, but I'm sure she enjoyed the experience and it'll stand to her in London 2012.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.30am:</strong> \"Just reading your excellent coverage of Olympics. Without being all 'Channel 4 News' about it, isn't Sarah Stevenson in danger of being sent to a Chinese Re-education Camp for her protests?\" asks Sam Williams. Well thank you very much for your kind words, Sam, but I think our Olympic coverage - this bit of it at least - was excellent until I took over. This is my Olympic Rolling Report debut and I'm struggling badly. The fact that I'm usually only going home at this time on a Saturday morning isn't helping. I thought Sarah Stevenson was remarkably stoic considering the robbery that was visited upon her. I mean, it's difficult to put into words how much of a travesty it was. She nearly kicked her Chinese opponent's head clean off her shoulders and at least two of the judges managed to miss it. Imagine of Padraig Harrington had holed his winning putt in the US PGA and the tournament officials had just ignored it and handed the trophy to Sergio Garcia instead - that's how bad it was.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> The men's mountain-biking is still going on, with France's Julian Absalon looking home and hosed for France. His compatriot Peraud is still coming second, over a minute behind. Two Swiss riders are battling it out for third place, while the Brits are coming 11th and 15th respectively.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.41am: </strong> \"That taekwondo bout just about nails it for me with every sport that requires a judges score,\" harrumphs Tom Clarke. \"There have been numerous scandals in the boxing, why on earth did they bring another sport like that in? However, surely with 'home support' we must do better in 2012?\"</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.42am:</strong> With just one lap of the circuit to go out of eight, France's Julien Absalon leads his compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud - barring an accident they'll finish first and second respectively. Swiss riders Nino Schurter and Christoph Sauser are almost certain to duke it out for the bronze medal, as they've opened a decent gap to Germany's Manuel Fumic.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>The shame of it - this is the result that put the Russians ahead of Great Britain in the medals table ...</strong></p> <p>Olympic synchronised swimming team free routine.</p> <p>1. Russia 50.000 points 99.500<br>Anastasia Davydova/Anastasia Ermakova/Maria Gromova/Natalia Ishchenko/Elvira Khassianova/Olga Kuzhela/Elena Ovtchinnikova/Svetlana Romashina/Anna Shorina</p> <p>2.

China 48.750 97.334<br>Gu Beibei/Jiang Tingting/Jiang Wenwen/Liu Ou/Luo Xi/Sun Qiuting/Wang Na/Zhang Xiaohuan/Huang Xuechen</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.55pm:</strong> After 1hr 55min 21sec in the saddle, the world's greatest exponent of mountain-biking is about to become the first man to successfully defend his Olympic title. He crosses the line, jumps off his bike, taps the road and waves appreciatively to the cheering crowd. Soon after, Jean Christophe Peraud rolls home to bag silver, while Nino Schurter comfortably beats Christoph Sauser to take bronze for the Swiss. For Great Britain, Liam Killeen finishes in a very credita ... no, it's very creditable because he had a crash early doors, 7th place. His thunder is somewhat stolen, however, by Italy's Marco Fontana, who finished 5th in extravagant style by riding the last couple of hundred metres pulling a one-handed wheelie. Top class!</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.14am:</strong> With nothing Olympic on at the moment, the BBC have handed over to Shirley \"Blonde in a boat\" Robertson, who is interviewing people at the Great Britain sailing party. They're all heroically drunk, including her. \"Sheesh my besht boson's mate!\" Meanwhile back at the Taekwondo, all hell os breaking lose, where the Great Britain team have lodged an official complaint about the ridiculous result of the Sarah Stevenson match. The competition supervisory board has looked into the matter and ... CHANGED THE RESULT!!!</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p>VERY BRAVE TAEKWONDO OFFICIAL: \"In applying paragraph two on page 64 of the competition rules we have to change this result and to declare the British player as the winner. Justice is served.\"<br>ANGRY CHINESE MOB: \"Boooooo! Boo!\"</p> <p>Apparently this is unprecedented in Taekwondo - presumably the Chinese will appeal this decisions. Who'd have thunk a game of Lots Of Jumping But Not Much Kicking could be so exciting?</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.26am:</strong> It's worth noting that the announcement that the result of the Sarah Stevenson bout hjas been overturned has not yet been made in mandarin - all hell could break loose when that happens. Stevenson is now in the semi-final against a Mexican. On the BBC, the <em>chef d'equipe</em> of the British taekwondo team is saying that the Chinese had no grumbles about their girl getting her \"win\" taken away from her.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.32am:</strong> Chen Zong, the Chinese girl who has now been eliminated from the taekwondo, had been going for her third consecutive Olympic gold medal, so Stevenson couldn't have taken a bigger scalp. However, there are thousands of Chinese fans in the hall waiting to see their hero Chen Zong fight a Mexican - they still haven't been told what's going on in their own language.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.37am:</strong> According to my man near the spot, Sean Ingle, the Chinese may have re-protested. The scoreboard currently reads: \"Beijing apologises for the delay. Competition will commence shortly.\" The word from the BBC's commentator is that Great Britain's Sarah Stevenson will take on Mexico's Maria Espinoza in the taekwondo semi-final in five minutes.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.46am:</strong> It's announced in Mandarin, to the rather partisan crowd, that their girl won't be fighting in the semi-final. To say they're not best pleased is putting it mildly. Espinoza and Stevenson emerge for their bout to the sound of much booing. The rules: one point for a kick to your opponent's body, two points for a kick upsides their head. They get underway and at the end of round one, much to the delight of the largely Chinese audience, Stevenson finds herself 2-0 down.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> Round two: Sarah Stevenson goes 3-0 down after shipping another kick in the red protector around her torso. Moments later, she's 4-1 down and goes down with an injury to her right leg. At the end of round two, Stevenson finds herself 4-1 down and limping badly.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.53am:</strong> Thirty seconds into round three and Espinoza goes down injured, but she's OK. Bah! \"Sarah Stevenson needs the big head shot ... the money shot,\" says the BBC's Nick Mullins. Money shots? <em>Money shots?</em> That's a rule of Taekwondo I'm not familiar with, I have to confess. Anyway, the Mexican's chin remains blissfully splash- and foot-free, and she takes the win and goes on to fight for silver or gold, while Stevenson gets to fight for bronze. Despite getting her reprieve, Sarah Stevenson is saying that she didn't get enough time to prepare for her fight and wasn't ready for it. From where I'm sitting, it sounds suspiciously like a whinge.</p> <!-- Block 122 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NfkH3Q4JOQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/4NfkH3Q4JOQ&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/4NfkH3Q4JOQ&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>11.04am:</strong> Here's that Taekwondo fight to keep you amused while I go for a short break.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>11.21am:</strong> \"Dear Esteemed Guardian Journo,\" writes Rob Bloxham, beginning a mail I have a terrible feeling is going to be incredibly patronising. </p> <p>\"I know it's a little late (being Day 15 of this glorious sporting and marketing extravaganza) but I feel it's about time I drew your attention to an error that may have profound consequences for the future of the British Union.

He had to sit through a baseball match to write this, so the least you can do is read it. Then again, he's used to sitting through cricket matches, so he probably didn't find it too tedious. Andy's been a revelation at these Olympics - before he went to Beijing, none of us had any idea he could be such a diva, but he's thrown some Olympic-sized hissy-fits since his arrival in the Far East.</p> <!-- Block 125 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9oATItjGciw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/9oATItjGciw&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/9oATItjGciw&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>For want of something else to report, here's some amusing footage of an Australian swimming coach Lawrie Lawrence losing the plot completely when his boy wins gold at Seoul 1988. To the best of my knowledge, that's the last time the Aussies won an Olympic medal of any kind. All Lawrie's missing is a bait shop, a wife named Ailsa and some corks dangling from the brim of his hat.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>11.42am:</strong> That's me done for the morning, but Howard Swains will be here in as long as it takes to complete a clunky hangover and if you're very lucky, he'll tell you all about the delayed recording of the synchronised swimming that he's leering at on the television at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>12pm: </strong>As Glendenning heads off contemplates what would constitute a money shot in the <strong>synchronised swimming</strong> pool, I'll do my best to ignore the wonderfully choreographed department-store-beauty-counter-cum-Stepford-Wives currently spinning, smiling and splashing their way towards noon on the telly. Russia win this anyway, and overtake Britain at the top* of the medals table as they do.</p> <p>Instead, let's take a look at what's coming up. Lazarus in a Power Rangers costume <strong>Sarah Stevenson</strong> gets her chance to fight for bronze in the taekwondo repechage in about half an hour, although she reportedly knacked and ankle in qualifying** for the bronze medal kick-off that she would have been in anyway had the blustering British blazers not succeeded in their orchestrated whinge at the judges.</p> <p>Then there's the pipsqueak, loveable tyke, Artful Dodger <strong>Tom Daley</strong> in the 10m diving final. The six-year-old would become the youngest Sir in Great Britain should he take gold and force the Queen to knight him in the New Year's Honours list. More realistically, the middleweight <strong>James DeGale</strong> boxes for gold or silver at the Worker's Gymnasium at about 1.45pm our time. </p> <p>There's also the final of the baseball (the final final, no less, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/23/bottom_of_the_ninth_for_baseba.html\">as Andy Bull blogs about here</a>) between Cuba and Korea, and the bronze medal of the men's hockey. Nope, neither do I.</p> <p>Then it's the Bird's Nest all the way for the penultimate day of athletics. The women's 1500m runner <strong>Lisa Dobriskey</strong> is the best individual chance for Team GB!GB!GB!, although the telly commentators are still holding out hope that the <strong>4x400m runners</strong> can cling onto a tube of metal long enough to win something in the relay. I'm sceptical. </p> <p>Stay here, whatever.</p> <p>*provided, as per the British tabloids, third is the new first.<br>** losing the semi-final</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Handball:</strong> John Allen, in Singapore, is engrossed by the handball, and even manages to distill this nation's simmering anti-Russian sentiment into one email: \"At least we can take heart that the brave handballers of Norway, calling on the warrior spirit of their ancestors in Valhalla, are stuffing the Russians 32-22 in the women's final. With 26 minutes of the second half gone there's only a certain amount of time, unknown to myself, left before they take gold. And.....Norge win! Vladimir Putin, Lenin, Josef Stalin, Roman Abramovich, the first dog in space...your girls took one hell of a beating. 34-27. It's like a free gold for Team GB (and any people from the 6 counties who want in, too).\"</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>12.09pm: Boxing:</strong> Scrap that chronology as it seems it's boxing up first, with the Hammersmith Hammer James DeGale going for gold in the ring. I say Hammersmith Hammer, although I've only got the word of Rebranded Website's and two-time Beer Writer of the Year's Ben MacFarland to go on, who claims to have grown up on the similar west London mean streets as DeGale.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>12.13pm: The Naylor report:</strong> \"I'm deeply disappointed that Team GB failed to impress in the synchronised swimming,\" laments Our Gary. \"Had it done so, it might have inspired a generation in the municipal pools around the country. And what would be funnier than that?\" You tell us, MBM readership. What could be funnier than that?*</p> <p>*unfunny responses will be considered.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>12.15pm: Boxing: </strong>Ah hell, there's some feathweight boxing on first, in which a Cuban and a Thai are knocking the proverbial seven bells. The Thai fighter is dumped on his rear during the third round, but has the last laugh as the BBC decides to end it right there and tell us that he won 8-2. Again, you heard it here second.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>12.17pm: Taekwondo:</strong> Here's Sarah Stevenson in the taekwondo repechage, against Noha Abd Rabo, of Egypt. \"This day has been full of shenanigans and drama,\" says the taekwondo commentator, and he's not wrong. Take a spin through Glendenning's work earlier to catch up.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>12.19pm: Taekwondo: </strong>There's a good deal of squeaking to add to the kicking, jumping and dancing preciously described by newcomers to taekwondo in this MBM report. As a veteran of this pursuit, having watched Aaron Cook yesterday, I can tell you that it's hardly going according to the script here: Stevenson is 3-0 up at the end of the second round, which is not how it works for Team GB!GB!GB!'s taekwondo fighters. This should be a nailed on glorious defeat.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>12.22pm: Taekwondo: </strong> The Egyptian gets a point back against Stevenson, to bring her within two. But the Doncaster belle gets one right back, and then another one, to go 5-1 up with 30 seconds left.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>12.24pm: Sarah Stevenson wins bronze in women's heavyweight taekwondo</strong><br>She wins that bronze medal match 5-1 and becomes the first-ever British taekwondo medallist. \"She thought the judges had taken her dream away,\" hyperventilates Nick Mullins in the commentary box. But now she has that bronze medal, which is what we all dream of, always.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>12.28pm: Taekwondo:</strong> From the school of great British post-match interviews comes this question for bronze medal \"winner\" Sarah Stevenson in the taekwondo hall: \"What was the low point of the day?\" Matt Pinsent was the man with the mic.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>12.30pm: Athletics: </strong>Straight over to the Bird's Nest for the men's 800m final, where many of the favourites, and all the British runners - indeed, all of the European athletes - failed to qualify, leaving it <em>wide</em> open for someone else to win. From Africa, Asia or the Americas.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>12.37pm: Athletics:</strong> \"Two laps of intrigue and surely drama as well,\" says Steve Cram, bigging up the final of the 800m as though it's the new Inspector Morse. But no one dies in Oxford, just a gold medal for Wilfred Bungei, of Kenya, who leads for most of the second lap, holds off the challenge of Ismail Ismail (not a misprint), and takes gold. Ismailx2 takes silver and Alfred Yego is third.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>12.40pm: Javelin:</strong> I don't know much about Finnish javelin throwers, but my guess is that Tera Jarvenpaa, who has just taken the lead in the final of the men's competition, likes heavy metal music.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>12.41pm:</strong> As Lighting \"Usain\" Bolt joins his Jamaican team-mates on the podium for their 4x100m relay victory yesterday, we shift from the sublime sprinter to the ridiculous national leader and some \"intriguing\" comments from Gordon Brown on the Olympics, football and 2012: \"I think when people are looking at the Olympics in 2012 - Britain, home of football, where football was invented, which we gave to the world - I think people would be very surprised if there is an Olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it.\" It's coming home, etc., etc., for the next four dreary years.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>12.50pm: Taekwondo farce - Fighter kicks referee in the head: </strong> More bonkers nonsense in the taekwondo hall, quickly becoming the new hotbed of farce at these Games after the Stevenson incident earlier. In the bronze medal match of the men's over 80kg class, the Cuban player Angel Matos was timed out after going over the 60 seconds allowed for an on-mat injury. His Kazakh opponent celebrated the bronze and Matos got up and KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. I kid you not. He's just KICKED THE REFEREE IN THE HEAD. \"There could be police involvement,\" says Nick Mullins in the commentary box. \"There could be war,\" adds Barry Glendenning in my ear.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>12.56pm: </strong>Britain's Lisa Dobriskey is running in the final of the 1500m at the Bird's Nest, but I can't keep my eyes off the taekwondo hall feed and the hope that we see that referee kick again. No luck as yet, but this is a global incident in the making.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>12.58pm: Athletics: </strong> The censors are out in the taekwondo hall and they're pretending that it never happened. But I saw it with my own eyes (fortuitously, I grant you), that guy kicked the referee. Anyway, Lisa Dobrisky finished in fourth - agonising fourth as it's now officially known - after, apparently, getting her tactics wrong. No kidding. Anyway, Nancy Langat, of Kenya, won gold ahead of two Ukrainians. \"It's just a shame they don't give medals for fourth,\" says Brendan Foster. Made of what, Brendan? Tin? You don't go to Beijing to fourth.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> USA are playing Brazil in the final of the women's volleyball. China are playing Russia in the bronze medal match of the women's basketball. Cuba are playing Korea in the final of the baseball, and a Swede called Jorgen Persson is playing a Chinese named Wang Liqin, which you probably shouldn't say out loud, in the bronze medal match of the table tennis. That's what your missing here.</p> <p>\"She's a lovely, lovely girl,\" says Dame Kelly Holmes of Lisa Dobriskey, who has just blown her chance at Damehood by, by all accounts, getting her tactics totally wrong and allowing the leaders to get too far ahead of her in the 1500m final.</p> <p>Still a blackout on the taekwondo referee head-kick, by the way. But it happened. I swear it did.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>1.15pm: Diving: </strong>The men's 10m diving final has started, in which British embryo <strong>Tom Daley</strong> is leaping. I haven't got a clue about this, except that spinning is good, splashing is bad, and that Daley has got no chance of winning. Still, Luxin Zhou of China leads with 84 points after the first dive, and Daley is in agonisingfourth with less than that.</p> <!-- Block 146 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336904830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2008/08/23/cuban2.jpg\" alt=\"Angel Valodia Matos of Cuba kicks out at referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angel Valodia Matos of Cuba kicks out at referee Chakir Chelbat of Sweden.

The Cuban taekwondo loser kicks out at the referee.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>1.22pm: Athletics: Kenenisa Bekele takes gold in men's 5,000m </strong></p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>1.23pm: Athletics:</strong> We all got kind of carried away here after that taekwondo kick, so much so that I missed the majority of the men's 5,000m final. But Kenenisa Bekele absolutely cruised it, winning by about six seconds to complete the long-distance double for Ethiopia. He congratulates with an Usain Bolt-style arrow mime kind of thing, but sort of gets it wrong. It's a new Olympic record. Kipchoge and Soi were second and third.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>1.29pm:</strong> As Tom Daley tries to wrap up agonisingfourth in the diving, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/23/ever_increasing_cycles.html\">William Fotherington wonders where all our gold-medal-winning cyclists are going to bike to now?</a> Oh, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics.cubanattacksref\">read all about the Cuban Cantona attacking the referee here.</a></p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>1.35pm:</strong> The men's diving is in its third round now, and I've no idea how Britain's glint-in-the-milkman's-eye Tom Daley got on in the second round, nor if he's sprung in the third. But the women's 4x400m relay runners are out now in the Bird's Nest, so don't expect many more diving updates until the baton is nestled safely on the Beijing track.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro and Nicola Sanders are the women charged with showing their proud nation that they can pass the equivalent of a rolled up newspaper to one another three times without dropping it. Their impossible task begins momentarily.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>1.40pm:</strong> Team GB!GB!GB!'s Olympic champion Christine Ohuruogu is off first for Britain in this relay thing, and she's leading when she hands off to agonisingfourth place heptathlete Kelly Sotherton.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>1.42pm:</strong> A hopeless run from Sotherton, who runs out of steam and hands off the baton in fifth place to Marilyn Okoro. She manages to get back into second-last place, and it's Nicola Sanders now. Russia lead.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>1.43pm: USA win gold in women's 4x400m relay</strong></p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Athletics:</strong> The United States' Sanya Richards won it on the final leg, reeling in a huge lead from the Russians to take over with about five metres to go. Britain finished fifth.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Boxing:</strong> Breathlessly, we shift to the Worker's Gymnasium for the middleweight gold medal bout between <strong>James DeGale</strong> and Cuba's tapestry Emlio \"Bayeaux\" Correa.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>1.49pm:</strong> Terrific start for DeGale, who lands two punches in the opening minute to lead 2-0. Then it's three, and then one back for the Cuban, and then one more. And then ... what? ... DeGale gets two points after apparently being bitten by Correa. \"Hey, he bit me,\" DeGale says, and the ref agreed. The Brit leads 6-1 at the end of the first.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>1.54pm: Boxing: </strong> A thunderous right hand from DeGale takes him to 7-3 and then another couple of dabs gets him a 10-4 lead at the end of the round. The Cuban has lost his discipline already, in profound contrast to the \"Hammersmith Hammer\", who dances around a couple of haymakers from Correa and sneaks another quick point with a jab at the end.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> It's not pretty, but DeGale leads 12-10 at the end of the round, and is still looking for gold against a Cuban who seems keen just to hold on, drop back, and then charge messily forward. But that's a good end to the round for Correa, who connects with several swift combinations and might actually fancy his chances now. So don't read the top bit of this update, jut the bottom bit.</p> <p>Something else that wasn't pretty was the Cuban taekwondo referee-fight earlier, and his full crimes have now been listed as punching a referee, kicking a judge and spat on the floor. A perfect hat-trick, that has now earned him a lifetime ban for him and his coach.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>2.01pm:</strong> Anther scrappy round, but DeGale shows more composure to time a couple of right-hands to go 15-12 ahead. But the Cuban gets it back to 15-13 with 30 seconds left and DeGale attempts to cling on, literally, to the victory. He gets another smart jab in with 20 seconds left to go 16-14 up, and that's it. DeGale wins.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: Great Britain's James DeGale wins gold in middleweight boxing</strong></p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>2.03pm: Boxing: </strong> Britain get back on the gold track, or something equally hyperbolic, courtesy of a first-round bite from Emilio Correa, which costs him two points and ultimately gifts the victory to DeGale. It was hardly one for the purists, but that's a gold medal nonetheless, GB's 19th. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics.boxing\">Read about it here</a>. When it's done. Which it isn't yet.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: Athletics: </strong>Right on cue for the start of the men's 4x400m, the computer crashes. That means I pick it up as Andrew Steele passes off to whoever's running the second leg in sixth place. Tobin, that's who. USA lead, from Belgium (Belgium again?).</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>2.09pm: Athletics:</strong> Martyn Rooney is on the anchor leg for Britain but there's nothing he can do from sixth. USA wins, the Bahamas get second, Russia third and YES! agonisingfourth for Britain.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>2.11pm: Athletics: USA win gold in men's 4x400m relay</strong><br>Comfortable in the end for the United States, for whom Jeremy Wariner coasts to the line to wrap up the victory; the third fastest run of all time. Bahamas take the silver and Russia the bronze.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>2.18pm: Diving: </strong>Tom Daley lies sixth after the fifth round of the diving. The Chinese diver Luxin Zhou is on course for a pillar-to-post gold. He leads with 458.35 judge's points. Daley has 398.95.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>2.23pm:</strong> I think there are 10 rounds in the diving; there were in the semis, but maybe the final is different, who knows. I think they go in reverse order in each round, which means the young chimney sweep Daley will be off soon-ish. South Korea will be the reigning Olympic baseball champions from here until the end of time, as they've just won the last ever final.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>2.26pm: Diving:</strong> OK, so there are six dives in the final round and Tom Daley has just had his last plummet. It wasn't six of the best for the whippersnapper, and he won't be taking home a medal unless all of the remaining four divers are killed in the next ten seconds.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>2.28pm: Athletics and Diving: </strong>Your licence fee is currently paying for television coverage of the women's high-jump final, where some very spindly women, including a bespectacled one from Belgium named Tia Hellebaut, are soaring over a bar set at about 2.05m. Blanca Vlasic, of Croatia, has also done that and gets silver at least, with the bronze going to someone else. In the diving, British suggestive wink Tom Daley is out of medal contention, but the Australian Matthew Mitcham takes gold with an amazing last dive.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Australia win gold in the men's 10m diving after Mitchell scored an almost perfect 10 in the final round. The Chinese judge didn't think it was that great, but all the others did and the Australian pipped home favourite Luxin Zhou at the end. That's the only gold medal the Chinese were impartially judged not to have won.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>2.37pm:</strong> The bespectacled Belgian Tia Hellebaut wins gold in the women's high jump after both her and her better-sighted, or contact-lens wearing, Croatian opponent both clear 2.05m but can't go higher. Hellebaut took fewer previous jumps so wins.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Tom Daley was seventh in the diving, which is creditable for the 14-year-old, I'll grudgingly concede. He's got a difficult late adolescence and unceasing hype to look forward to before he can be officially crowned \"medal prospect\" for London 2012.</p> <p>That's that from another MBM day. It's the closing ceremony and hand-over to London tomorrow. Be sure to tune in.</p> <p>Bye.</p>"
