  "<p>Dublin taxi driver Carl is a loser. He has lost his wife, his self-respect and three grand at the roulette table - and he is about to lose his legs to local gangster Jackie Farrell, who wants the debt paid before midnight. Fat vegetarian Carl fears he is going to be mincemeat, but he hasn't reckoned on the loyalty and friendship of two other men on the cab rank: George, his father-in-law, and likely lad Bush. Soon the three are playing a game of bluff with Jackie and his thick son, Fred, in which the stakes are terrifyingly high.</p> <p>Like a kinder, rosier, more sentimental version of one of David Mamet's ingenious scam dramas, Robert Massey's comedy, produced by Irish new writing company Fishamble, is an enjoyable jaunt. It may not be the theatrical ride of your life, but it is an interesting portrait of men adrift in a world without the civilising influence of women. Women are entirely absent here - either dead, sick or the subject of sexual boasting - and yet their absence is keenly felt. The men plug the gap with obsessional behaviour: food, gambling or, in the case of George, taking advantage of Aldi special offers to stock up on toilet rolls.</p> <p>Massey's play often takes the scenic route, particularly in the ambling first half, but it is filthily funny, and after the interval Jim Culleton's amiable production ratchets up a gear. It helps that the acting is spot on, particularly from Bryan Murray as Jackie and Eamonn Hunt as George, two men bound together by past friendship and both determined to settle old debts.</p>",
  "<p>St Helens will bid a hearty good riddance to Super League's top-six play-off system when it is extended to include the top eight in next season's expanded, 14-team competition.</p> <p>Saints have finished on top of the table in each of the four seasons since Daniel Anderson succeeded Ian Millward as coach but Saturday's second consecutive Grand Final defeat by Leeds, who had collected one point fewer from 27 league fixtures, means they have been crowned champions only once during that time.</p> <p>In 2005 their hopes effectively disappeared with injuries to Sean Long and Lee Gilmour in a derby at Wigan which left the team so depleted they failed even to reach Old Trafford. They bounced back the following year to complete a rare double of Challenge Cup and Super League, beating Hull in the qualifying semi-final and again in the Grand Final. But in the past two years their consistency throughout the season has been negated by a Leeds team with a greater ability to peak on the big occasion. That is hard to stomach, given Saints' proud record of winning the title on each of their first four appearances in the Grand Final, between 1999 and 2006.</p> <p>Anderson's surprise and frustration at the latest below-par performance was graphically illustrated by the cameras that Sky is allowed to place in the Old Trafford dressing rooms. They captured the sort of half-time hairdryer blast which Sir Alex Ferguson has trademarked behind the closed doors of the Premier League.</p> <p>\"He did let us have it a bit,\" said Gilmour. \"But it was deserved. When we played with shape and field position we looked in control of the game but then we would go to sleep for 10 or 15 minutes, and you can't do that in a big game. We've trained hard all year for this and fallen at the last hurdle again. It's devastating.\"</p> <p>Anderson, who has earned a reputation as a softly spoken gentleman in his years at St Helens, had recovered his poise sufficiently after the game to make eloquent jokes about his half-time team-talk, for which only a basic lip-reading ability was required to detect a strong hint of the Joe Kinnears. \"I can't really itemise the words I used, but we were having a chat - or I was doing a soliloquy - because I didn't think we were honest with our capabilities,\" he said.</p> <p>The blast paid off as Saints reverted to safety-first, wet-weather rugby and pulled level at 12-12 with a scrappy Matt Gidley try on their second set of the second half. But then Lee Smith produced a freakish 40-20 kick - described by Anderson as \"the key play of the whole game\" - to set up the position for Danny McGuire to put Leeds ahead again. Despite Ade Gardner's 28th Super League try of the season, Saints never seemed to have enough vigour or conviction to launch one of the late fightbacks for which they used to be renowned.</p> <p>Anderson refused to blame that lack of energy on the play-off structure, which had restricted his players to two matches in the five weeks since their Challenge Cup final win against Hull on August 30. But the strategy of resting up, with a three-day break in Madrid, must now be judged a failure and Saints will surely try something different if they are involved in the play-offs next year.</p> <p>The Super League clubs are still debating some radical proposals for the structure of those top-eight play-offs, one of which involves allowing the top three teams to choose their opponents in the first round. Whatever happens, the issue of the week off before the Grand Final will disappear, because the Old Trafford combatants will be determined by two semi-finals, as in Australia - where Manly, who finished second to the Melbourne Storm in this year's National Rugby League table, yesterday emulated Leeds with a 40-0 Grand Final victory which sets up a World Club Challenge against the Rhinos in February.</p> <p>But preparing Saints to make it third time lucky in next year's Grand Final is no longer Anderson's problem, because he will now fulfil the promise he made to his wife and four children of a return to Sydney after eight years on the road, even though he does not currently have an Australian coaching job to take up. </p> <p>\"Obviously it's not the way I wanted to go but I honestly don't see it as a shame for me, I see it as a huge privilege to be going back with 3\u00bd years of wonderful memories,\" he said.</p> <p>It is Mick Potter, another Australian who has driven the Catalans Dragons success story over the past three seasons, who must now steer Saints through what could be a tricky transitional phase as mainstays such as Long and Keiron Cunningham follow Paul Sculthorpe towards retirement in the next couple of years.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>'s director general, Mark Thompson, will go before the Trust next month to deliver his masterplan to save public service broadcasting. Just a few months ago, the corporation was arguing that the funding black hole facing its rivals was not nearly as bad as they claimed. Now it is proposing a solution to their woes. The shift is indicative of a year in which the BBC's position on the PSB debate has reversed. </p> <p>The way in which Thompson's pitch is communicated and received will set the tone for the debate over the future of the BBC. For Thompson, and the BBC Trust, chaired by Sir Michael Lyons, the stakes could not be higher. </p> <p>The debate is set against a context in which ITV job cuts are running into four figures as it contemplates a 20% slump in advertising and Channel 4 is slashing its headcount, programme budget and even the pilot projects designed to point the way to its future. The rest of the British media sector, from digital startups to newspaper groups, is contemplating a slump likely to deepen further into 2009. </p> <p>Against that background, the BBC would not appear to be top of the list of potential casualties of the earthquakes shaking the industry. Its licence fee funding is secure until 2013. Onscreen and on air, it is in relatively rude health. Online, the iPlayer is a triumph. Around the globe, its commercial division is forging ahead with ambitious plans to roll out global \"superbrands\" and set up production hubs from Sydney to Hollywood. </p> <p>But an increasingly wide coalition of senior political and regulatory figures believe that, if Thompson is unable to fundamentally rewire the corporation's institutional circuits and overhaul its culture, it could be storing up serious trouble. Perhaps, counter-intuitively, it could be the BBC that faces the greatest threat in three or four years' time, when the debate about the licence fee reaches a climax once again. This would especially be the case with a Tory government in power. </p> <p>Despite what has been described by the BBC as a challenging licence fee settlement early last year, its overall revenue will increase by about 5% this year, as against a 5% decline for ITV, C4 and the rest of the commercial sector, according to industry estimates. Yet, for all its relative comfort, the BBC has appeared insecure and defensive in recent months as criticism has increased. \"It is as though it can't understand just how bad things are outside its walls. Everything is seen through a BBC prism,\" said one senior broadcast rival. To its competitors, it seems ubiquitous. Everywhere they turn, it's there first. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror's chief executive, Sly Bailey, was the latest to hit out last week. She said the BBC's plans for local broadband sites were \"a threat to the development and diversity of the local media sector online and potentially to its print-based cousins\". A lot of this rhetoric can sound like crocodile tears - like commercial radio before them, regional newspapers are as much victims of their owners' incompetence and the structural challenges of the digital age. The BBC makes a convenient scapegoat to mask their own strategic failings.</p> <p>But the problem is now acute partly because the structural and technological shifts facing other public service broadcasters have so radically changed the landscape. The disconnect between the corporation and its rivals has also been reflected in the BBC's actions and the way it has presented them to the outside world. It's unlikely there would have been quite such an outcry against the aggressive expansion of BBC Worldwide had it not been trumpeted so loudly from the rooftops just as its commercial competitors were retrenching. </p> <p>BBC concern has been heightened by the prospect of a Tory government and it is already moving to head off the perceived threat. Its new director of policy and strategy, John Tate, formerly ran the Opposition Policy Unit, advising the shadow cabinet, and co-wrote the 2005 Tory manifesto with David Cameron. Earlier this year, the wagons were well and truly circled as the Trust's Lyons abandoned any pretence at independent regulation to take up his sword against those who might top-slice the BBC. One minute the Trust has argued the problem is not as bad as Channel 4 and others have claimed, the next that it can provide the solution rather than Ofcom. </p> <p>And the continued insistence on the BBC's \"unique link\" with the licence-fee payer as an argument against sharing the \"digital surplus\" or other assets could backfire too. Several studies - from Ofcom to the Guardian and, it is understood, internal research at the BBC and Channel 4 - show that link between the BBC and viewers is neither as strong nor as deep as it would have us believe. And that effect is only going to be exaggerated in a digital age, in which people feel more affinity with programmes and talent than channels and broadcasters. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the BBC's arguments have at times appeared inconsistent. An aggressive move against top-slicing belatedly replaced by an insistence that greater partnerships could be the solution smacked of expediency rather than strategy. This uncharacteristic tactical uncertainty contrasts with the surefootedness the BBC has displayed in the past, when it countered threats to its independence with armies of strategists. </p> <p>The former culture secretary Tessa Jowell once said the licence fee should act as \"venture capital for the nation\" and there are plenty of competitors who would like that taken more literally. </p> <p>The odd thing about the BBC's aggressive PR strategy is that it seems at odds with Thompson's proclaimed instinct. Intellectually, he understands that the only way to save the BBC in the long term is to turn it inside out and weave it so tightly into the nation's broadcasting, cultural and technological fabric that it can't be unpicked. In 2004, when Thompson returned from Channel 4 to a BBC laid low by the fallout from the Hutton report, he was clutching the Building Public Value manifesto, which promised a revolutionary change in the way the corporation interacted with the outside world. It promised to make \"the BBC more open and less defensive\". In an ambitious nine-point plan, it proclaimed: \"We need to change and have a more open attitude to what others think about us, of our business relationships, our buildings, our impact on the market and our partners.\" </p> <p>Yet, more than four years on, relations with the outside world are worse than ever. At the point at which the BBC didn't get the licence-fee settlement it wanted, partly due to a tactical error by Thompson, it retreated into its shell. </p> <p>Thompson suggested recently that discussions over closer cooperation are well advanced, but rivals say that if that's the case, no one has told them. At Ofcom and Channel 4, they are maintaining an open mind but are sceptical as to whether the BBC's proposals around sharing technology and studios, and cooperating on commercial initiatives, can deliver enough tangible benefits. </p> <p>Thompson's proposals will be expanded versions of ideas already aired earlier this year, including sharing studios, equipment and expertise with regional competitors; acting as an aggregation engine for public service content from other broadcasters and institutions; exploring global commercial opportunities through BBC Worldwide; developing IPTV services to be delivered via set-top boxes; and a renewed push to help commercial radio by fundamentally rethinking DAB. </p> <p>But more than all that, the BBC will have to change its attitude. As Ofcom's Philip Graf put it last week, \"what to the BBC is genuinely meant as a warm embrace can feel to the receiving party like a bear hug\". It will be up to Thompson, not always the most nuanced in his public pronouncements, to show that his revived partnership plan represents a genuine change rather than mere window dressing. If not, the consequences - for the BBC as much as its rivals - could be profound.</p>",
  "<p>A man whose teacher admitted abusing him over six years was told that his claim for government compensation should be kept at the lowest level because his experience was a \"one-off incident\" and \"consensual\", the Guardian can reveal. </p> <p>Steve Foster, now in his 40s, made a claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), the government body responsible for compensating innocent victims of violent crime. Foster, who applied after speaking out about the abuse he at one point suffered two or three times a week at boarding school, said he was \"incensed\" by the authority's handling of his claim. \"This was the most clear-cut case imaginable\", he says. \"The man had confessed and been added to the sex offenders register. I had, on every level, been confirmed as a survivor of abuse. And they were saying I had consented.\"</p> <p>Foster is one of a number of victims of sexual abuse whose treatment by the CICA has caused outrage amongst lawyers and victims' groups. In August the Guardian revealed that 14 rape victims, including a woman who said her drink had been spiked, had their compensation reduced on the basis that they had contributed to their attacks because they had consumed alcohol.</p> <p>The Guardian has spoken to a number of adult victims of child abuse who say they have been left devastated by the CICA's handling of their cases. One man who was abused by a former member of staff at a care home when he was 13 says his claim for compensation failed because his abuser had given him money and cigarettes. The man says he was \"absolutely stunned\" by the decision of the CICA's predecessor, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. \"It almost felt like they were saying that what happened to me was okay because I got paid for it,\" he says.</p> <p>The CICA said it was \"committed to treating all victims of violent crime with sensitivity and courtesy at all times\". But according to the lawyer who represented Foster, experiences such as these are not isolated. \"CICA is a very important institution because it says to people who have been the victim of crime, especially traumatic crime, that they have an avenue where the state will help them,\" says Jonathan Wheeler, partner at law firm Bolt Burdon Kemp and treasurer of the Association of Child Abuse Lawyers. \"But in my experience it is a bureaucratic process whose real concern is saving money for the taxpayer.\" </p> <p>The experience, victims say, also extends to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel (CICAP), a separate organisation that hears oral appeals against CICA's decisions. Having already been told in writing that his experiences of abuse were consensual, Foster nearly gave up after he had to hear this argued before the panel. \"I felt sick and wanted not to go through with the hearing. After all the reassurances from friends, family and therapists telling you it's not your fault, suddenly some bureaucrat says it is after all. I genuinely felt it was a tactic to make people who are vulnerable just say 'Stop, I can't go through with this any more'.\" </p> <p>Another applicant, who asked not to be named, had his appeal rejected by CICAP in what he felt was an insensitive process. \"I was put through nearly three hours of grilling without a lawyer,\" the man recalls. \"I was expecting a friendly, relaxed atmosphere; instead it was like a courtroom.\"</p> <p>CICAP's chairman, Roger Goodier, admits the lack of representation is an issue. \"There are cases where applicants would feel more comfortable if there were represented,\" Goodier says. \"But the panel has to obtain the best evidence ... sometimes this does involve probing and challenging questions, which we try to do in as sensitive a manner as possible.\" </p> <p>Wheeler says the current compensation system makes the victim \"feel as if they have been abused twice: once by the person who abused them, and again in their treatment at the hands of the state\".</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on the 9 November 2011 to anonymise a CICAP applicant's name at his request.</p>",
  "<p>The Electoral Commission, the independent party funding watchdog, has cleared the Conservative party of breaking electoral law by using a commercial company as a front to provide millions of pounds of services to Tories fighting marginal seats. </p> <p>The ground-breaking decision could open the way for rival parties to set up donor-funded commercial organisations to pour millions of pounds into the next general election campaign and get round the spending limits for campaigning. </p> <p>A confidential report by the commission's investigators has rejected a complaint from the Labour party against Constituency Campaigning Services (CCS), a commercial organisation backed by Tory millionaire donors that provided call centres and leaflets for 164 constituencies at the last general election.</p> <p>The report follows a two-year investigation into the organisation, based at Coleshill Manor, near Birmingham.</p> <p>If it had upheld Labour's complaint, the scale of pre-election donations, running in excess of \u00a31m, to the centre would have meant the Conservative party had broken electoral law by breaching legally binding spending limits when it fought the 2005 general election.</p> <p>In just three days during the last campaign it issued 3m mail shots and called 300,000 people.</p> <p>The decision was greeted with approval by the Conservatives yesterday but has angered the Labour party .</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said: \"The Electoral Commission's two-year investigation into the funding of the Conservative campaign centre at Coleshill still leaves a number of unanswered questions and has potentially serious implications for issues around party funding, donation transparency and campaign expenditure limits. We will be writing to the commission seeking further clarity on these issues.\"</p> <p>Brian Jenkins, Labour MP for Tamworth, said: \"The Electoral Commission have ignored the central issue: that Coleshill is really part of the Conservative party. It employed Tory staff, printed Tory leaflets, called Tory voters. </p> <p>\"If the commission let this slide they'll be giving a green light to every party ... to separate out parts of their organisation and operate them at arm's length, beyond the reach of electoral regulations.\"</p> <p>Among the high-profile donors to the centre are Conservative multimillionaire Robert Edmiston, whose property company, IM Group, owns the Coleshill Manor business centre and reimbursed the rent for the organisation, Anthony Bamford, head of the JCB digger company, who also bankrolls the office of William Hague, the shadow foreign secretary, and John Butcher, a former Tory minister, through the Midlands Industrial Council.</p> <p>Sources close to the investigation say the Electoral Commission investigators cleared the Tories on two counts. Firstly, they found no evidence of any written agreement between the Conservative party and the CCS about providing services, and secondly they were satisfied that the organisation was charging genuine commercial rates to Tory constituency parties for its services.</p> <p>The CCS declares itself as a \"regulated donee\" and declares all its donations on the Electoral Commission website. The Labour party argued it should be reclassified as a Conservative party organisation.</p> <p>The Electoral Commission said yesterday: \"As a result of our investigation, the commission has concluded that CCS's charged rates were comparable to commercial rates. On this basis there is no evidence that donations should have been declared by the party and the commission has decided to take no further action.\"</p> <p>The commission has asked the Conservatives to review salary payments for one member of the CCS staff who handles branding and messaging services which it said should be reported as a donation.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday October 8 2008</strong></p> <p>In this article we said David Lammy had taken up Vernon Coaker's brief as minister for drugs policy. That is not the case. David Lammy has been promoted to minister of state in the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. Alan Campbell has replaced Vernon Coaker in the home office. This has been corrected.</p> <p> </p> <p>Lord Adonis, the passionate advocate of academy schools was yesterday surprisingly moved to transport in the reshuffle, a shift that brought Tory claims that Gordon Brown was going soft on radical reform of schools.</p> <p>Brown also appointed Phil Woolas as a controversial new immigration minister and took the risk of installing a Tory defector, Quentin Davies, to the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Adonis's departure to transport, where he will look at issues of infrastructure, is surprising in that he had expressed no special interest in the area and was seen as a symbol of Brown's commitment to the schools reform programme. The prime minister has backed an increase in the number of academies, but there have been battles over their continuing freedom from local council control.</p> <p>The Tories suggested that Adonis had fallen out with the children's secretary, Ed Balls, over education policy, including the degree of independence from local authorities that academies should enjoy. Adonis rushed out a statement yesterday praising Balls and saying he had told Brown in the summer that he wanted a new challenge.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the shadow children's secretary, said: \"Everyone who believes in the integrity of the academies programme and the reform agenda in education will be disturbed to hear that Ed Balls has kicked Andrew Adonis out of the education department. The fact that Lord Adonis has been moved from his post only emphasises how this reshuffle is about rewarding cronies and not about governing in the national interest.\"</p> <p>In all, 17 cabinet ministers, junior ministers and whips have left the government, making it a more thorough reshuffle than expected, with a pointed emphasis on a new economic structure.</p> <p>The Labour party, meanwhile, confirmed that Douglas Alexander, the international development secretary, would remain election coordinator, and that Harriet Harman would stay as chairwoman of the party.</p> <p>Woolas said he might back an annual cap on migrants entering Britain. Brown appointed him specifically because of his tough remarks on immigration this year, including a warning to some Pakistani communities against fuelling birth defects by inter-marrying. Woolas told the Guardian: \"We must not pander to racists, but it is particularly important that we have a credible policy on population that can reassure people.\"</p> <p>There was no ministerial appointment for Jon Cruddas, the Labour leftwinger, but he will be given a role helping to lead the party's campaign against the BNP. Jon Trickett, a former chairman of the leftwing Compass group, has been made Brown's parliamentary private secretary.</p> <p>Ian Austin, one of Brown's current two PPSs joins the whips' office, as does John Spellar, the former defence minister. In other key appointments, Mike O'Brien, takes on the energy brief in Ed Miliband's new department, replacing Malcolm Wicks, who becomes a climate change envoy for the prime minister.</p> <p>Tony McNulty shifts from the Home Office to become employment minister and also minister for London. Vernon Coaker, the drugs minister, is promoted to minister of state responsible for police and terrorism. Coaker's drugs brief is taken up by Alan Campbell.</p> <p>Shahid Malik, the international development minister, gets a higher profile brief in the justice department. His previous post goes to Ivan Lewis, the health minister. The social care brief goes to Phil Hope. Four of the ringleaders in the plot to oust Blair in 2006 - Chris Bryant, Sion Simon, Wayne David and Kevin Jones - are given ministerial posts. Sion Simon, one of the best writers on the Labour benches, has been made skills minister.</p> <p>Jones, a member of the defence select committee, has been made a defence minister. David is one of five whips given ministerial jobs for the first time, including the barrister Sadiq Khan. Bryant, a former church of England vicar is made shadow deputy leader of the house, replacing Barbara Follett. Bryant is a strong advocate of parliamentary modernisation and has recently written a paper on reforming the monarchy's lines of succession. Follett, wife of novelist Ken, goes to the culture department to succeed Margaret Hodge, who is being given compassionate leave to look after her ill husband.</p> <p>Housing minister Caroline Flint has been made Europe minister, and expected to use her campaigning skills to help the party in elections for the European parliament. Those elections in June are seen as the last possible date on which Brown could be challenged as party leader.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why local is best</strong></p> <p>I read Jane Martinson's column (Opinion, September 29) with close interest. I can only speak for my own newspapers, which are all local weeklies. There are nearly 1,200 such weeklies, paid-for and free combined, in the UK. Martinson is right. We are concerned about the present economic position in the country. Alistair Darling may also be right. Perhaps it is the worst downturn since the second world war, but it can hardly be as bad as the war itself, and the local press came through that just as it has survived every downturn since. </p> <p>Our Sunday Independent goes back to the Napoleonic wars and many of our other papers are 125 or 150 years of age. The three of us who run this group have over 125 years in local weeklies. We'll survive this problem just as we have survived all the others because we have the finest journalists and representatives and management in the newspaper industry and we give our readers what they want - local news in great detail.<br><strong>Ray Tindle, chairman, Tindle Newspapers Ltd</strong> Farnham, Surrey</p> <p><strong>We need answers</strong></p> <p>Kim Fletcher provides a fascinating backdrop to the changes in newspapers and the reactions of politicians that illuminates the current confused media scene (A political career can slip on a banana, September 29). Yet, like most commentators, he fails to address the vital question: is this what readers want?</p> <p>Apparently not when you see the dropping newspaper circulation figures, the diminution of the staffs of local papers, which no longer cover courts and council meetings, plus the reduction in TV time for regional news and the loss of 1,000 ITV jobs. So what is the solution? It surely can't be Roger Alton's shameful recipe to raise the cover price and provide more tits and bums. There are answers out there, but nobody wants to listen, let alone act.<br><strong>Gerald Isaaman </strong>Wiltshire </p> <p><strong>Bloggers spell it out</strong></p> <p>I pretty much agree with what Jeff Jarvis says (Let's junk the myths and celebrate what we've got, September 29), but he doesn't cover one subject that has baffled me for ages, and was one of the reasons why I created my first blog some three years ago: why are so many bloggers barely literate? No idea of the structure of the language, can't spell, can't punctuate, can't even communicate ideas coherently, and yet they're out there in legions. There are exceptions, mercifully. The Cumbria News and Star used to host a blog by a young single mum. Her early blogs were plagued by random apostrophes and assorted scatter-gun punctuation, and the spelling was pretty poor too, as I recall. But within a relatively short time she was writing very well indeed, and entertainingly, too (always a bonus), and hers is an example a great many bloggers could usefully take to heart.<br><strong>Ron Graves </strong>Prenton, Birkenhead<strong> </strong> </p> <p><strong>A solution for C4</strong></p> <p>I'm surprised you take the sort of statements Michael Grade makes at face value (theguardian.com, September 29). ITV and Channel 4 just want a slice of the BBC's licence money. It's funny how so many free-market losers immediately demand state aid. Both have lost out to Sky in advertising revenue and now they want something to replace it. The best solution would be either to denationalise C4 or simply close it - preferably the latter. It has too many channels, and is doing too little with them. As for ITV - remove its public service broadcasting obligations and let it operate in the free market it is trying to wriggle out of.<br><strong>Ron Ardell </strong>Woking, Surrey</p>",
  "<p>The last time it happened, I remember trying to scream but no sound came out of my mouth. I knew I had my phone near me, so I grabbed it and started dialling for help. But when I looked down at my hand, I realised I hadn't called anyone. I was awake, yet paralysed and still dreaming. It was as though my body and brain had been completely severed from each other. While I was imprisoned in my mind, my body had been cast adrift.</p> <p>Sleep paralysis is the most terrifying thing about narcolepsy, so I am lucky that it doesn't happen to me that often. With the exception of sleepwalkers, most people's bodies become paralysed when they enter REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we dream and this paralysis stops us getting up from our beds and acting out our dreams. But I can wake up during this stage of sleep, and when I do I am completely paralysed. My eyes are open, I can look around me but my brain has not come out of REM so I cannot tell whether what I am doing is real, or part of a dream.</p> <p>I was diagnosed in July this year. I had already been at the sleep clinic in Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Hospital in London for 24 hours, electrodes attached to my body as they ran test after test. Finally, the doctor told me I had narcolepsy. This is defined as daytime sleepiness: the inability to stay awake despite a normal, full night's sleep. But daytime sleepiness sounds like quite a gentle, cosy disorder. It isn't; it feels like a curse. I am 27 years old and I have slept for at least 15 hours a day, every day, for the past 13 years. </p> <p>It is horrible to look back on life only to see how much I have missed because I was asleep. But now past experiences have started to make a lot more sense. My mum stopped me from going to sleepovers and parties when I was a child. They would make me so exhausted that I had to take Mondays and Tuesdays off because I was too tired to get up. At school I took lunchtime naps. </p> <p>Sleep will creep up and envelop me within a matter of minutes. I try to fight it, but sometimes I just can't. My work as a neuroscience researcher at London's Goldsmiths University means I often attend conferences and seminars. It does not look good to doze off halfway through a lecture, but sometimes there is nothing I can do. </p> <p>I can fall asleep anywhere. I remember waiting for a delayed flight at an airport with an old boyfriend. The place was packed, everyone was shouting. Despite sitting on a hard, marble backless seat I was asleep, still upright, in seconds. \"How do you do it?\" he marvelled. </p> <p>I first went to the doctor when I was 14, but no one took me seriously. I was told it was hypersomnia, the opposite of insomnia, and sent on my way. Two years later, I was taking cocaine to help me stay awake. My drug habit didn't get me high, it simply helped me get up in the morning. I have always needed a boost and recently an old university friend reminded me how much I would dose up on ProPlus before a night out, just to make sure I would stay awake. I visited various doctors over the years but was always fobbed off. It was my age, my student lifestyle, an underactive thyroid gland, anaemia ... none of them was right and I grew more frustrated with myself. Why was I so lazy? What was my problem? </p> <p>Battling to stay awake in the face of overwhelming tiredness is such a familiar, horrible feeling but I have developed little tricks over the years to keep it hidden. At a desk or in a seminar I try to fall asleep with my hand holding a pen so it looks as though I am pretending to write, but I am not sure how convincing that is. To stay alert I dose up on caffeine, underdress (so I will be cold), pinch my thighs or wiggle my toes - anything to keep me moving. The more uncomfortable I can make myself, the better chance I have of staying awake, so I avoid comfy chairs and warm places for the same reason.</p> <p>Narcolepsy is like being plucked out of the world only to be dropped back in it, hours later. I am constantly trying to catch up with my life. One day I went missing. When no one could reach me it was my best friend who concluded that they would find me somewhere in a park, asleep. No one believed her, but she was convinced and, sure enough, that is what happened. I had been asleep for hours only to wake and discover countless missed calls on my phone. </p> <p>Thirteen years after the first doctor's appointment, I finally know that narcolepsy is the reason for all the holes in my life and I can at last have the support and treatment I need. Rather than people thinking me rude for dozing off in front of them, I can explain myself, which is a huge relief. But while receiving the diagnosis was a momentous occasion, there was no drama sitting in the clinic talking to the doctor. I was just trying to understand what this meant for the rest of my life. </p> <p>I soon started to feel angry, though. If only someone had listened to me I would not have spent every day of so many years battling on my own. I could have lived a more normal life. </p> <p>The drug I have been prescribed, modafinil, has made life easier. It gives me palpitations and I have lost my appetite, but now I cannot physically fall asleep - which is good, except I have to inhabit a no-man's land for most of the day where I am awake and tired. But it has only been three months and things are improving as the medicine kicks in a little more. </p> <p>Mornings are still challenging, even with the drugs. It can take up to an hour before I am ready to go. For years, I have relied on an elaborate system of alarm clocks. Two clocks are set to go off within five minutes of each other. This is followed by a third, set on a five-minute snooze cycle for half an hour, then the iPod kicks in and finally the TV comes on. This always comes on last, when I am almost awake, to avoid me dreaming the programme instead of waking up to it. I have put a lot of thought into this system: on days with an early start, I will set the TV to come on twice. </p> <p>My sleep disorder is the result of reduced levels of the hormone, hypocretin, which controls wakefulness. For most people, sleep comprises non-rapid eye movement (NREM) followed by REM, when you dream. With low hypocretin, I go straight in and out of REM sleep. This sharp shift between wakefulness and dreaming makes for some strange symptoms, such as hypnagogic hallucinations, which I have had all my life and find quite pleasant.</p> <p>I start seeing shapes move before my eyes, sometimes accompanied by sounds, and it tells me that I am about to sleep. I use this to my advantage. I am still awake, so I know that I must be falling asleep the moment I see them. It is a useful early-warning system. </p> <p>The more relaxed I am, the more real the hallucinations become. I remember having a massage and looking at a man sitting across the room drinking water. It seemed to make sense until I realised I could not possibly be watching a man in a restaurant drinking water while I was lying face down on a massage table. I managed to bring myself back into wakefulness again by telling myself that it was not normal and could not be happening.</p> <p>As a way of helping me realise when I am asleep and when I am really awake, I have started learning how to dream lucidly. A lucid dream is when you can control what you are doing while dreaming. Imagine you are looking at a bus. Now look away, then look back. If you were dreaming, instead of seeing the bus again, you would see something else - a tree, a giraffe, a spaceship. I try to do this sort of test to see where I am - in a dream or in reality. Once I have done that, I know whether to wake up.</p> <p>In a strange way, it is good that I got my diagnosis later in life. Instead of having an excuse - I've got narcolepsy - I have had to push myself. But now I know what is wrong, I know life is going to get easier. And I am looking forward to it</p> <p>\u2022 Helen is a pseudonymn. This article originally appeared under the subject's real name. She was talking to Catherine Jones.</p>",
  "<p>Five hours after eating a tuna roll at 6am, Britain's Jo Pavey discovered yesterday that she has found the right diet to help her become a world-class road runner. Packed with proteins to control a blood sugar problem, Pavey was beaten narrowly in a thrilling finish of the 28th Great North Run.</p> <p>When she competed here last, in 2006, Pavey spent two hours needing medical treatment after almost not making it across the line. This time, she led with 500 metres left and ended the race in third, losing out by two seconds as Gete Wami of Ethiopia won in 68 minutes and 51 seconds from Magdelane Mukunzi of Kenya in 68:52. Pavey's 68:53 was a personal best by 1:47 and it was enough to make her hungry for more.</p> <p>She will now pursue her transition from track runner to marathon runner, having cracked the illness which played such a part in her effort here two years ago. </p> <p>\"It is better than in 2006 when it all went pear-shaped,\" said Pavey. \"My sugar levels are at 16.1 now - it should be nine or 10, but then it was 20. I did not have enough proteins and that was what affected me at the end of that race because my sugar was so high. I have had many tests to sort it out.\"</p> <p>The Commonwealth Games 5,000m silver medallist had never run a half-marathon before when she made it to fourth place here in 2006, but now she has dealt with her body's ability to cope with the increase in distance. Her menu yesterday saw her start with that tuna roll, followed by a power bar in the 90 minutes leading up to the race and then, moments before the gun fired, some energy gel. It worked. </p> <p>\"I really wanted to win today,\" she said. \"I was pleased with it but also frustrated. To come so far in a race and miss out like that was difficult. I am not sure where I am going to make my marathon debut, though it will be within the next 12 months. But I have learned a great deal today. I am still gaining experience in these long road races and this was a step in the right direction. The surges in the race were interesting. It is about knowing whether to go with the others or not.\" </p> <p>She will now focus on moving up to 26.2 miles. At 35, the marathon at the Olympic Games in London in 2012 is her main target - along with having her first child between now and then - and she showed enough signs yesterday that such ambition is realistic. By halfway, the contenders had been reduced to three and though Pavey often dropped back, she quickly rejoined Wami and Mukunzi on a glorious morning's run from Newcastle to South Shields. </p> <p>There was hardly a cloud in the sky and though it was cool, Mukunzi overheated after making a break with three miles to go. She stayed in front as the course reached the last mile along the coastal road, but Wami, the World Marathon Majors champion, and Pavey quickly caught her. Pavey went into the lead, but Wami is renowned for her superb finishing ability and she took over as the line came into view. Mukunzi went with her and Pavey made another challenge, but Wami had enough to hold on for victory. \"I thought I could win at one point but the other two girls were very strong,\" said Pavey. </p> <p>Next stop for Wami will be the New York Marathon on November 2, when she will face Paula Radcliffe, who beat her in the Big Apple last year. \"It is not a case of revenge,\" said Wami. \"I found out on the internet that Paula is running. I was surprised because in Beijing, she stopped and had some problems. It is always a battle when I run against her and it will be a good race between us.\" </p> <p>African men have won this race since 1991 and the Ethiopian Tsegay Kebede, the Olympic marathon bronze medallist, ensured that record was maintained with one of the best performances in the history of the race yesterday. Kebede broke away with nine miles left and was never troubled after that, winning in 59:45 from his countryman Gebre Gebremariam, in 61:29, with the American Abdi Abdirahman third in 61:33. </p> <p>It was another disappointing morning for Britain's men, with Dan Robinson the first home, in 13th place in 64:11. His former team-mate Jon Brown, who now runs for Canada, was two places in front in 63:36. </p> <p>A total of 37,250 runners started out from Newcastle and Leanne Symonds, from Northumberland, the one millionth entrant in the history of the race, crossed the line in 2:41:27.</p> <p><strong>Men</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Tsegay Kebede, Eth, left, 59:45</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Gebre Gebremariam, Eth, 61:29</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Abdi Abdirahman, US, 61:33</p> <p><strong>Women</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Gete Wami, Eth, 68:51</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Magdelane Mukunzi, Ken, 68:52</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Jo Pavey, GB, 68:53</p> <p><strong>Wheelchair - men</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Josh Cassidy, Can, 44:10</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Ralph Brunner, Ger, 45:03</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Rafael Botello Jimenez, Sp, 47:58</p> <p><strong>Wheelchair - women</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Diana Roy, Can, 51:18</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Shelly Woods, GB, 51:19</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>Francesca Porcellato, It, 59:12</p>",
  "<p>It has been an exceptional season for Coolmore but the Irish racing empire suffered two reverses in quick succession here yesterday, in two of the season's most significant Group One events for juveniles. Again, the favourite for the Prix Marcel Boussac, and Mastercraftsman, who was long odds-on to win the Grand Criterium, both failed to live up to their pre-race billing, and drifted sharply in the betting for next year's Classics as a result. </p> <p>Again, who is trained by David Wachman, the son-in-law of John Magnier, Coolmore's owner, was slowly into her stride from a wide stall in the Boussac, and did not travel smoothly at any stage. The winner, Proportional, is trained by Criquette Head-Maarek, who is never afraid to send a good filly to the Guineas at Newmarket, and her victory was enough to bring her into the betting for the Classic at around 6-1. \"She will be entered for the Guineas and then we will see,\" Head-Maarek said. \"She will tell me what to do.\" </p> <p>Mastercraftsman's defeat was an unexpected setback for Aidan O'Brien, who sent out his 21st Group One winner of the season at Newmarket on Saturday. Naaqoos made all the running to add further lustre to what has already been an outstanding season for trainer Freddy Head. </p> <p>\"It may have been one run too many for him,\" O'Brien said. \"He ran on very heavy ground two weeks ago, which was his first run back after a break.\" Rip Van Winkle, a stablemate of Mastercraftsman, is now the firm favourite at 9-2 or shorter for next year's 2,000 Guineas. Naaqoos has been introduced to the betting at around 14-1. </p> <p>\"This horse gets tougher with every race and he has made a lot of progress,\" Head said. \"Davy gave him a great ride as he was supposed to wait, but the way the race turned out he found himself in front as the horse is very fast. He had the presence of mind not to stop him and make the most of his speed. That is the mark of a great jockey.\" </p> <p>Lush Lashes was another Irish raider (and favourite) to come up short in the Prix de l'Opera. She hit the front close home but was collared by Lady Marian.</p> <h2>Ron Cox's tip of the day</h2> <p><strong>Cheviot 3.00 Windsor</strong></p> <p>The form of Cheviot's two-lengths fourth behind Nasri at Newbury looks sound and Michael Jarvis's colt deserves extra credit for his finishing position from the highest draw - in a 16-runner field, the principals were drawn three, four and five. Cheviot was in turn clear of the rest and the speed he shows suggests he will not be inconvenienced by dropping down a furlong in distance.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Worcester</strong> spoiled Shane Geraghty's return for <strong>London Irish</strong> with a 22-5 EDF Energy Cup win at Sixways yesterday. Mike Ruddock's team collected a bonus point for scoring four tries and thus sit on top of Group C, ahead of the Ospreys.</p> <p>Miles Benjamin, a key player for England's grand slam-winning Under-20s last season, scored two of Worcester's tries from the wing. He was watched by Martin Johnson, the England manager, whose main concern would have been the form of Geraghty and London Irish's scrum-half, Peter Richards, another elite-squad member making his first start of the season. Geraghty played at inside-centre, his likely position for England in the autumn internationals. Gloucester's Olly Barkley and Wasps' Riki Flutey are Johnson's other options at No12. </p> <p>Benjamin scored the first try of yesterday's match after a quarter of an hour, thanks to a long pass from the Welsh fly-half Matthew Jones. A missed tackle from Geraghty contributed to the next Worcester try, scored by the lock Graham Kitchener, and Irish's fly-half, Eoghan Hickey, missed three kicks at goal before his side got on to the scoreboard when Richards took a quick tap on the home 10-metre line and ran 40m for a try. Hickey, predictably, missed the conversion. Benjamin then scored Worcester's third from another Jones pass and Loki Crichton scored the bonus-point try.</p> <p>On Saturday <strong>Bristol</strong> lost again, 30-17 in a Group D match at <strong>Northampton</strong>. One consolation was the performance of the 20-year-old wing Mathew Turner, who scored two tries four days after his arrival from South Africa. Chris Ashton, Lee Dickson, Paul Diggin and Chris Mayor touched down for Saints. The Welsh referee Nigel Owens showed five yellow cards, reducing Bristol to 13 men early in the second half. </p> <p>Bristol's head coach, Richard Hill, said: \"Things are picking up. We aren't playing terribly but we are shooting ourselves in the foot. The story of our season is that we tend to let the other team score within about 15 seconds of getting the ball. We tend to kick deep, they counter-attack and within 15 seconds they are under our posts, which is killing us. </p> <p>\"I was delighted with Mathew Turner. He has only had two training sessions with us and he went on to score tries on both wings and make a try-saving tackle. He was spotted playing on the sevens circuit and I was told he was special, so we moved quickly.\"</p>",
  "<p>The arrival off the bench of Owen Farrell, the son of the Saracens centre and rugby league great Andy Farrell, as the youngest player ever to play in English professional rugby, at 17 years and 11 days, highlighted one of the great redeeming features of the EDF Energy Cup. The much-maligned tournament can often be a showcase for up-and-coming talent in the Anglo-Welsh game.</p> <p>Farrell, who came on after 62 minutes, is slightly older than his illustrious (and currently injured) father was when he made his Wigan rugby league debut, at 16. However, in a match in which Saracens opted for youth against an altogether more gnarled Scarlets outfit, it was too much to expect a fairytale baptism for Farrell the younger - who beat Danny Cipriani's record by 36 days. After a couple of deft touches he joined the legion of players unable to control the ball in the wet conditions, conceding a knock-on. </p> <p>This was never trench warfare, however, and both sides did their best to play with the ball in hand, but Saracens needed to be more pragmatic if they were to upset a full-strength Scarlets side who are treating this tournament as their best chance of silverware this season. The Welsh region, fielding an all-international pack including two new signings, the New Zealand tighthead prop Kees Meeuws and the Australia No8 David Lyons, had the better of it in the close combat, and were also cleverly marshalled by Stephen Jones. The Wales fly-half nursed the Scarlets through their ropier patches, and also nailed the majority of his goal-kicks, six out of eight, giving the visitors a 16-14 half-time lead and then closing the game out as the Scarlets got a crucial edge after the break. </p> <p>That edge came courtesy of a try by the powerful Meeuws seven minutes into the second half. With the Scarlets trailing 17-16 and battering away at Saracens' line, the prop smashed his way over in the left-hand corner, Jones converting for a 23-17 lead. Jones stretched that scoreline to the final winning margin just after the hour, when Dan Scarbrough was sent to the <br>sin-bin for tripping Gavin Evans as the Scarlets centre was threatening a try. It was a harsh call, because Scarbrough appeared to slip as Evans chipped the ball over him.</p> <p>Saracens were unable to unlock the Scarlets defence thereafter, despite the best efforts of Noah Cato. The England Under-20 full-back or wing combines power with sinuous grace and was the pick of the six players aged 20 or under that Saracens fielded yesterday. </p> <p>The Scarlets made the first inroads of the match when the Saracens captain, the Fijian scrum-half Moses Rauluni, was forced to carry the ball into his own in-goal area. From the third of three successive five-metre scrums, Lyons got the touchdown. </p> <p>Jones converted, but five minutes later Saracens levelled matters at 7-7 when a decoy run by Cato drew defenders wide and Francisco Leonelli cut through to score, Gordon Ross converting. Cato went one better when he ran in an overlap midway through the half, beating Cieron Thomas and Jones on the way. Ross converted for a 14-7 lead. </p> <p>However, with Jones kicking three penalties in succession it was the Scarlets who led at the break, and although Ross gave Saracens the lead again briefly with an early second-half penalty, the result finished in favour of experience rather than youth. </p> <p>Afterwards Saracens' coach, Eddie Jones, paid tribute to Farrell and the other youngsters in his side. </p> <p>\"We have six or seven guys who have good futures if they work hard - and they will work hard - and Owen is one of them. He's got a very serious attitude and he's desperate to make it. He has the right attitude and good footballing nous - he's been hearing about rugby ever since he was born, so consistent education works.\" </p> <p>Although it did not reap an immediate dividend here, on this evidence Saracens' youth will have its day.</p> <p><strong>Saracens </strong>Scarbrough; Thrower (Penney, 65), Leonelli, Goode </p> <p>(O Farrell, 62), Cato; Ross, Rauluni (Wilson, 78); Lloyd, Cairns (Walker, 78), Mercey (Visagie, 52), Chesney, Spencer (Smith, 58), Barrell, Saull (Wray, 57), Skirving.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Leonelli, Cato <strong>Cons</strong> Ross 2 <strong>Pen</strong> Ross.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Scarbrough, 62. </p> <p><strong>Scarlets</strong> C Thomas; M Jones, King, G Evans, Brew; S Jones, Roberts (Martens, 75); I Thomas (John, 72), Rees (Owen, 76), Meeuws, Cooper (MacLeod, 66), Maling, Easterby, G Thomas, Lyons.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Lyons, Meeuws <strong>Cons</strong> S Jones 2<strong> Pens</strong> S Jones 4.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Roberts, 65. </p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> J Jones (WRU).<strong> Attendance</strong> 6,068. </p> <p>Heineken Cup one to watch: <strong>Regan King</strong>(Scarlets)<br> King is one of the best centres not playing international rugby <br>and if the Harlequins midfield fails to shut down the New Zealander's space at Stradey Park this Saturday - the last Heineken Cup match before the bulldozers move in - they will pay the price.

  "<p>Does the law really treat children in Britain as badly as the United Nations seems to believe? Last week's report by the UN's committee on the rights of the child (CRC) paints a gloomy picture, upbraiding the government for neglecting the rights of people under 18 on a wide range of issues. The occasional compliment that the government has done something good is usually followed by a list of often trivial complaints. </p> <p>But how worried should we be that children in this country are being denied the basic rights of childhood? Some of the strictures of the CRC relate to matters already much debated - for instance, the call to outlaw all forms of corporal punishment, even the \"reasonable chastisement\" we now allow. I cannot see a change in government thinking on this one. But on two aspects of children's brushes with the criminal law, the UN committee is surely right. It is a continuing disgrace - and contrary to everything we know about the mental development of children - that the age of criminal responsibility remains at 10 for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and at eight in Scotland. It is equally unacceptable that locking up children is still seen as playing an important part in dealing with juvenile crime; comparable countries have non-custodial programmes - and less youth crime. </p> <p>Does the CRC report raise any new issues which the government ought to take seriously? A child's right to privacy is one. Reality television shows such as Channel 4's Supernanny, which was criticised by the report's authors, and the constant interest of press and paparazzi in the offspring of celebrities are obvious - and potentially harmful - invasions of a child's private life. The problem is that it's often the parents who decide how much exposure their children should have. </p> <p>JK Rowling's case made it clear that parents had the right to ban photos of their children being published. But if they don't care, or actively push their children into the limelight (which is not necessarily bad for the kid), should the law interfere? How? </p> <p>The UN report has painted a bleaker picture than the reality, but that doesn't disqualify much of what it says. The government should pay attention to it, but I doubt it will. Anyway, it doesn't have to. The CRC's next report on Britain isn't due until 2014. </p> <p>The legal year which was ceremoniously inaugurated last Tuesday is noteworthy for several reasons. It's the final year in which the House of Lords will be the highest court in the land. The supreme court takes over (except in Scotland) in October 2009 and the law lords become \"justices of the supreme court\". Sir Igor Judge, now Lord Judge, has taken over as lord chief justice, and Lord Phillips becomes senior law lord for a year, going on to be the first chief justice of the new court. </p> <p>But the most startling innovation of the new legal year is visual. On the whole (I won't go into the tortuous exceptions) judges in civil cases will no longer wear wigs in court, and their black judicial gowns - newly designed by Betty Jackson - will have tabs at the neck, colour-coded to represent the seniority of the judge. So, provided you've swotted up the colours, you'll know immediately what kind of court you've stepped into and how much respect the judge is worth.</p>",
  "<p>In election races, pollsters habitually look for the \"tipping point\" - the moment when a contest shifts decisively in favour of one of the contestants. </p> <p>Such moments are elusive; sometimes they never happen. But four weeks before US presidential and congressional elections, a consensus is emerging among analysts in both main parties that 2008's tipping point was reached last week - and the Republicans were left up in the air with their legs dangling. </p> <p>Such predictions are necessarily hedged around with numerous \"ifs\" and \"buts\". But daily tracking polls, nationally averaged polls, surveys in the 10 or so \"battleground states\", and internal party polling are all now pointing broadly the same way. On these projections, and barring major surprises, the Democrats will sweep the board in congressional races, gaining six to eight Senate seats and a dozen or more in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>More importantly perhaps for a watching world, on these trends Barack Obama will be elected US president on November 4 with a clear mandate for change. If Republican candidate John McCain cannot quickly regain control of the agenda in the final 28 days, the outcome may not be even close.</p> <p>McCain's decision to halt campaigning in Michigan, a state he had targeted as a possible \"flip\" (Michigan voted Democrat in 2004 and 2000), followed internal poll findings placing him a full 10 points behind, a Republican analyst said. Florida, won easily by George Bush last time, is an even more alarming prospect for McCain.</p> <p>Aggressive advertising by Obama claiming, contentiously, that McCain would tax healthcare and privatise social security has had a big impact on older Floridians, the analyst said. Obama is currently an average three points ahead in the Sunshine state. A similar picture obtains in traditionally conservative Virginia, Ohio, and Nevada. The Democrat has even edged ahead in stereotypically redneck North Carolina.</p> <p>The principal reason for the Obama break-out after months of running neck-and-neck is voter anger with Bush and by association, McCain's Republicans, over last week's initially bungled financial bailout. If the exact moment when the election \"tipped\" can be guessed, it was last Monday when House Republicans defied McCain and defeated the $700bn package.</p> <p>The property price meltdown, credit crunch, price inflation and rising unemployment all played a part in September's mood swing. So, too, did last week's vice-presidential debate, watched by up to 100 million people via television and internet. McCain's quixotic running mate, Sarah Palin, did better than expected - but failed to alter the overall election dynamic.</p> <p>According to analysts at the pro-Democrat National Committee for an Effective Congress (Ncec), demographic changes underlie the Democratic surge in key states. Researchers found the movement to the suburbs and \"exurbs\" of a steadily increasing number of young, upwardly mobile, professional whites, blacks and Hispanics - a trend begun in the 1990s - was boosting Democratic support in traditional \"red\" states such as Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>Consultant Mark Gersh has described this shift as the corollary of the 1980s move of socially conservative, blue-collar voters in the South and elsewhere to the Republicans - the so-called Reagan Democrats. \"The biggest thing that happened in 2006 (in the congressional polls) was the final movement of upper-income, well-educated, largely suburban voters to the Democrats,\" Gersh noted. The Ncec says this trend is accelerating this year.</p> <p>The presidential race is not over yet. It remains unclear what impact Obama's colour will have on election day voting. An unexpected scandal, negative attacks such as Palin's weekend \"terrorist\" slur, or an international crisis could scare voters away from the youthful Democrat. And McCain has the chance to force another tipping point in tomorrow's second presidential debate.</p> <p>This encounter is critical. He requires an outright victory. He needs to draw blood. And he is promising he will.</p> <p>Influential conservative commentator William Kristol admits the odds are now against McCain. But Kristol says he can still turn it around by moving the focus from the economy and on to Obama's judgment, honesty, associates, and liberal views. \"Character is a legitimate issue. Obama hasn't shown much in the way of leadership or political courage, and he's consorted with dubious figures. It's fair to ask whether Barack Obama is personally trustworthy enough to be president, and the McCain campaign shouldn't be intimidated from going there.\"</p>",
  "<p>Allegra McEvedy is the sort of person who has always been famous; doubtless, at nursery other kids used to trail after her, hoping for crumbs of attention. I'm sure she dispensed them. She's a generous soul, Allegra. </p> <p>Guardian readers who follow her weekly columns, and those who have taken part in her regular cookery workshops on our Word of Mouth food blog, will already have a sense of her: encouraging, jolly, noisy and, above all, enthusiastic. In person, she is all these things, and tactile to boot. At a party she will always be at the head of her own little herd, identified by the gales of rude throaty laughter.</p> <p>In short, McEvedy won't bloody shut up, and nor, thank God, will her food. When she cooks, it's always big-fisted stuff. It's the enemy of prissiness, friend to flavour. Sure, she's done her time at the pass in fancy restaurants; she once led the kitchens at Robert De Niro's Tribeca Grill in New York. She has done stints at the Groucho club - from which she was sacked for being found in the shower with a friend and a bottle - and the famed River Cafe. But it is the role she has now, as the food queen for the nine-strong, quality, seasonal fast-food chain Leon, that suits her best. Its slogan - \"food which tastes good and does you good\" - speaks to the woman's instinctive need to nurture. </p> <p>The recipes brought together in the new Leon cookbook, which we begin serialising today, make it obvious that this is a whole lot more than bald, corporate sloganeering. Allegra and her team at Leon mean it. There really is no arguing with her recipes for butterbean and chorizo stew or her butternut and bacon chowder, her chilli con carne made with braised hunks of chuck steak rather than crumbly mince, or her Moroccan chicken tagine, which has been a Leon bestseller for years. And for good reason. It's fantastic, gutsy, Technicolor stuff. Sure, none of her dishes is exactly elegant. Allegra doesn't do elegant, or at least not in the classical sense. (No one who has seen her in her trademark tweed trilby would argue.) But most of the time that's not what we want from dinner. We just need sustenance, stuff that tastes great and makes us feel good about both ourselves, and the fields that supplied the ingredients that fed us. All of that is what McEvedy does best. Enjoy. </p> <h2>Moroccan meatballs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338308783\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/meatballs5.jpg\" alt=\"Leon's Moroccan meatballs\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When you meet a Leon regular, especially blokes, and ask them what they usually have there, more often than not the answer is \"Meatballs!\" This recipe was the subject of much hot debate and flowery language, but time has proved it was all worth it - not only because they're still on the menu in exactly the same recipe, but because they are always in our top five year-round best sellers.</p> <p><strong>Handsome supper for six</strong></p> <p><strong>The meatballs</strong></p> <p>1\u00bd wholemeal flatbreads (the smaller size, roughly 20cm in diameter) or pitta</p> <p>120ml milk</p> <p>1kg minced lamb</p> <p>A small bunch of parsley, finely chopped</p> <p>A small handful of mint, finely chopped</p> <p>1 tsp dried oregano</p> <p>2 cloves of garlic, chopped</p> <p><strong>The sauce</strong></p> <p>30ml olive oil</p> <p>3 cloves of garlic, crushed</p> <p>2 x 800g tins of chopped tomatoes</p> <p>1\u00bd tbsp harissa</p> <p>A handful of basil, leaves picked and chopped</p> <p>A handful of parsley, chopped</p> <p>Salt and pepper</p> <p>Rip the flatbread into pieces and soak in the milk for 10 minutes.

We have some wonderful regulars who have been eating this three times a week for years.</p> <p><strong>Serves two</strong></p> <p>2 tbsp quinoa</p> <p>\u00bd head of broccoli</p> <p>300g free-range chicken thighs, each cut into 4 pieces and marinated overnight, or 4 x 70g slices of salmon fillet</p> <p>2 handfuls of rocket</p> <p>2 handfuls of baby spinach</p> <p>2 vine-ripened tomatoes, roughly chopped</p> <p>120g frozen peas (if using fresh, use 500g unshelled pods)</p> <p>1 lemon</p> <p>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>A light sprinkling of alfalfa sprouts</p> <p>3 tbsp a\u00efoli</p> <p>2 tbsp toasted seeds</p> <p>A hefty sprinkling of chopped mint and parsley</p> <p>Salt and pepper</p> <p>Put 80ml of water into a small pan and bring to the boil. Stir in the quinoa and boil fast for five minutes, then turn the heat down and simmer for five minutes more. Turn the heat off, fluff with a fork, and leave until cooled.</p> <p>Preheat your grill to very hot, or get your griddle pan smoking.</p> <p>Cut the broccoli into small florets and slice the stalks into 1cm thick circles. Drop into a pan of rapidly boiling salted water for three minutes, then drain and run under the tap until cold.</p> <p>Season your protein. Then for chicken, grill for five minutes, turn it over, then five minutes more; a scant three minutes each side for the salmon slices.</p> <p>While all this is going on, build your salad: toss the leaves, tomatoes, broccoli and peas in the juice of half a lemon and the olive oil. Lift on to one big serving dish or individuals, scatter on the cooled quinoa and alfalfa. The next layer is the protein (try feta if you're veggie). Top with the a\u00efoli, seeds and herbs, with the other half lemon, wedged, on the side.</p> <h2>Sweet potato falafel</h2> <p>We wanted falafel on the menu, but couldn't make the normal ones because we chose not to have any deep-fat fryers and baking them made them dry and crumbly. Benny had a stroke of genius about basing them on roasted sweet potatoes, then binding the mix with chickpea flour, giving them their falafelly credentials. Back flavours of spices, punched up with fresh herbage, make these a year-round winner and our most popular veggie dish to date. As a mezze, we serve these with chopped tomatoes and pickles and a\u00efoli.</p> <p><strong>Makes around 18 falafel - enough for four</strong></p> <p>2 medium sweet potatoes (orange inside), around 700g in total</p> <p>1\u00bd tsp ground cumin</p> <p>2 small cloves of garlic, chopped</p> <p>1\u00bd tsp ground coriander</p> <p>2 big handfuls of fresh coriander, chopped (about 30g)</p> <p>Juice of half a lemon</p> <p>120g gram flour</p> <p>A splash of olive oil</p> <p>A sprinkling of sesame seeds</p> <p>Salt and pepper</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 220C/425F and roast the sweet potatoes whole until just tender (45 minutes to 1 hour). Turn off oven, leave the potatoes to cool, then peel.</p> <p>Put the sweet potatoes, cumin, garlic, ground and fresh coriander, lemon juice and gram flour into a large bowl. Season well, and mash until smooth with no large chunks. Stick in the fridge to firm up for an hour, or the freezer for 20-30 minutes. When you take it out, your mix should be sticky rather than really wet. You can add a tablespoon or so more of gram flour if necessary (the water content of sweet potatoes varies enormously).</p> <p>Reheat the oven to 200C/400F. Using a couple of soup spoons (put a well-heaped spoonful of mix in one spoon and use the concave side of the other to shape the sides) or a falafel scoop if you have one, make the mixture into falafelly looking things and put them on an oiled tray. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top and bake in the oven for around 15 minutes, until the bases are golden brown.</p> <h2>Magic mackerel</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338308475\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/mackerel.jpg\" alt=\"Leon's magic mackerel\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>These days you have to choose your fish carefully. Mackerel ticks all our boxes: tastes great, full of good oils that make you think better, from the seas around here and not endangered.</p> <p><strong>Serves four for a light lunch</strong></p> <p>200g couscous</p> <p>2\u00bd tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>1 tsp ground cumin</p> <p>2 juicy lemons</p> <p>\u00bd head of broccoli, cut into florets</p> <p>5 fillets of undyed smoked mackerel</p> <p>80g hazelnuts, toasted and very roughly chopped</p> <p>75g dried apricots, chopped</p> <p>2 tbsp toasted seeds</p> <p>2 tbsp dill, finely chopped</p> <p>2 big handfuls of rocket, roughly chopped</p> <p>4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p> <p>salt and pepper</p> <p>Put the couscous into a large bowl and stir in the oil, cumin and a hefty pinch of salt, plus the zest and juice of half a lemon, making sure each granule is well coated. Pour 300ml of boiling water over the couscous, stirring well to ensure there are no dry areas left. Cover with clingfilm and leave for 10 minutes somewhere warm.</p> <p>Blanch the broccoli for three minutes in boiling salted water, then run under the tap until cold.</p> <p>Once the couscous has done its thing, break it up by gently rubbing it between the palms of your hands. Take the skin off one of the mackerel fillets and flake it through the couscous in small pieces that you can't really see. Mix in the nuts, apricots, broccoli, seeds, dill and lastly the rocket (be gentle). Adjust the seasoning and dress with lemon juice (about \u00bd-1 lemon - use the rest as wedges) and extra virgin olive oil. Gently break each of the remaining fillets into two or three pieces and sit atop the couscous.</p> <h2>Butternut &amp; bacon chowder</h2> <p>Chowders are associated with clams, summertime and New England, but this is a slightly heartier recipe that gently slides into autumnal eating.</p> <p><strong>Serves four</strong></p> <p>3 tbsp butter</p> <p>200g streaky bacon, diced small</p> <p>3 cloves of garlic, chopped</p> <p>1 large onion, diced</p> <p>1 small butternut squash (about 650g), peeled and cut into 2cm dice</p> <p>2 medium floury potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 2cm dice</p> <p>500ml chicken stock</p> <p>100ml double cream</p> <p>500ml full-fat milk</p> <p>3 big handfuls of flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked and roughly chopped</p> <p>1 tbsp thyme, roughly chopped</p> <p>Salt and pepper</p> <p>Over a medium heat melt the butter in a big heavy-bottomed pan. When it's just about going nutty brown, scatter in the bacon in separate pieces, not a clump. Keep cooking on a medium heat until the bacon starts to crisp and takes on a nicely golden brown appearance. Then stir in the garlic and cook for a further few minutes to release the flavours.</p> <p>Add the onion and some salt and cook gently for a further 10-ish minutes with a lid on the pan until the onion is very soft but not browning. Splosh in a couple of tablespoons of water to get the colour and any sticky bits off the bottom of the pan.</p> <p>Once the onions are super-soft, add the squash and spuds, turn the heat down a tad and continue to cook and stir occasionally for a further 10 minutes. When they are all well-coated, whack the heat up a bit and pour in the chicken stock and cream. Simmer the soup for 15-20 minutes, until the squash and spuds are soft but not collapsing.</p> <p>Now add the milk and bring to a simmer; as soon as this has happened, turn the heat off: do not let it boil or the milk will split.</p> <p>Using a slotted spoon, take out about half the veggies, letting the liquid drain back into the pan. Blend the veg to a smooth pur\u00e9e and add back to the soup. Check the seasoning, stir in the chopped parsley and sprinkle with thyme just before serving.</p> <h2>Leon gobi</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338308476\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/gobi.jpg\" alt=\"Leon gobi\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>At Leon we give the veggies who eat with us quite a lot of TLC, and this curry took a long time to get spot on before it went on the menu: it's all about the balance of spices, sweetness and making sure you time the veg right so it doesn't all fall apart. The Gobi refers to the cauliflower. It's the addition of ground almonds that provides the wonderful consistency.</p> <p><strong>Gobi good for six</strong></p> <p>1 medium onion, halved and thickly sliced</p> <p>1 carrot, thickly sliced</p> <p>2 tbsp sunflower or peanut oil</p> <p>1 red chilli (go for a bird's-eye if you like it hot - some do)</p> <p>2 thumb-sized pieces of root ginger, washed but not peeled</p> <p>5 cloves garlic, peeled</p> <p>1 large tsp Madras curry powder</p> <p>1 tsp turmeric</p> <p>1 tsp black onion seeds</p> <p>1 medium sweet potato, washed and cut into 2.5cm dice</p> <p>4 heaped tbsp ground almonds</p> <p>A good handful of sultanas</p> <p>\u00bd a small cauliflower, broken into florets</p> <p>1 x 400ml tin of coconut milk</p> <p>150g frozen peas</p> <p>Juice of \u00bd a lemon</p> <p>A really big handful of coriander, roughly chopped</p> <p>Salt</p> <p>2 heaped tbsp desiccated coconut, to serve</p> <p>In a large saucepan, cook the onion and carrot over a medium to low heat in the oil for 15-20 minutes with the lid on, stirring occasionally. Season with salt.</p> <p>Blitz the chilli, ginger and garlic to a paste in a food processor. Stir the paste into the onions once they have begun to soften, along with the spices (including the onion seeds). After another five minutes, season with salt, add the sweet potato chunks and the almonds and mix well so that everything is well coated.</p> <p>Turn the heat up a bit and stir in 500ml of water and the sultanas. Bring to a simmer and leave it to bubble gently for 10-15 minutes with the lid off, stirring occasionally.</p> <p>Add the cauliflower florets and the coconut milk and simmer for a further 10-15 minutes, covered. Check that the sweet potato and cauliflower are both cooked, turn the heat off and stir in the peas.</p> <p>It will need more salt, plus the lemon juice and chopped coriander to finish it off right. We serve it with a sprinkling of dried coconut on top.</p> <h2>The Leon better brownie</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338308477\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/06/brownie.jpg\" alt=\"Leon's better brownie\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is the lovely Emma's recipe, which she's been making for us down in Dorset since day one and which has won many admirers. As you can tell, she is a bit particular about the way it's done, but all power to her - it's the best brownie in the world.</p> <p><strong>Makes 12 big 'uns</strong></p> <p><strong>The melting</strong></p> <p>180g unsalted butter</p> <p>200g dark chocolate (Belgian 54% cocoa solids)</p> <p>2 tsp espresso at room temperature, or other very strong coffee</p> <p><strong>The mixing</strong></p> <p>1 tsp organic cold-pressed sweet orange oil or finely grated zest of 1 orange</p> <p>80g sweet Spanish almonds (skin on), toasted and chopped</p> <p>4 free-range eggs</p> <p>100g ground sweet Spanish almonds</p> <p>160g dark chocolate chunks (Belgian 54% cocoa solids)</p> <p>160g very dark chocolate chunks (Belgian 72% cocoa solids)</p> <p>150g fructose</p> <p>Pinch of sea salt</p> <p>3-4 drops of Madagascan bourbon vanilla extract</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.</p> <p>Melt the butter on full power in a microwave for 1 minute (this can also be done in a small pan on the hob) and separately melt the dark chocolate in a bowl over a pan of hot water on the stove. Stir the chocolate well, ensure it is completely melted, and be careful not to burn it.</p> <p>Once the butter is melted and allowed to cool slightly, add the coffee and stir well, then add whichever orange bits you are using (if you add anything too hot or too cold to the mix it can cause it to shrink - have your ingredients at room temperature and not straight from the fridge).</p> <p>Roughly chop and toast the skin-on almonds for 10 minutes and leave to cool.</p> <p>(When it comes to this next bit take special care to place the ingredients into the mixing bowl in the order stated - this ensures a nice even mix of all ingredients and the eggs don't come into contact with the warmed butter.)</p> <p>Put the eggs in first, then all the ground almonds, then the dark choc and very dark choc chunks, and lastly the fructose. Stir in the salt and vanilla, followed by the butter mixture. Mix well until creamy and thickened but be careful not to over-mix - too much air will cause the brownie to crumble when baked.</p> <p>Spoon the mix into a well-buttered baking tray 30 x 30cm, or something with similar volume.</p> <p>Take extreme care not to over-bake. The brownie is ready when the edges are slightly crusty and the middle is still soft. The middle should be very moist but should have a firmish feel to it - about 20-25 minutes. Remember that fructose goes much darker when baked than sugar. The brownie also develops a glossy sheen and does not look baked when it is. I'll say it again - you need to be very careful not to over-bake.</p> <p>\u2022 Extracted from Leon: Ingredients and Recipes, by Allegra McEvedy, published by Conran Octopus on October 13, price \u00a320.

  "<p>People who take an interest in newspapers say it's really fortunate for the industry that, with a global financial crisis raging, so many editors used to be City journalists. What they mean is they've noticed that Will Lewis is editing the Telegraph and James Harding the Times.</p> <p>I'm not sure you need to be able to recite the FTSE 100 to know that the collapse of capitalism is worth a splash. While Rebekah Wade has no previous as banking correspondent, the Sun has covered the story perfectly well. But the promotion of business editors is an interesting phenomenon. We'll get on to whether their business background has affected the way Lewis and Harding have handled the banking meltdown shortly. First, let's discuss why they are there.</p> <p>City reporters are unusual. They tend to be numerate, an unusual skill among journalists. I once watched Charles Moore, then editor of the Sunday Telegraph, test the financial ability of his staff by asking everyone at conference to estimate the level of public spending. None of us said \u00a3179bn, which is what it was at the time. One of the newsroom suggested the figure was probably as high as \u00a3500m.</p> <p>Behind their tough exteriors, City reporters have real feelings. It's not that many of their colleagues don't understand their pages, it's that they don't even read them. The Neil Collins column on the back of the Daily Telegraph was morning reading for every chief executive in business, but the poor man used to come to conference only to hear other departments suggest stories he had written about that very day.</p> <p>Conventional wisdom suggests City journalists aren't interested in stories in the world beyond finance. Conventional wisdom is wrong; it depends on the individual. Andreas Whittam Smith founded the Independent on the back of a career in financial journalism. You wouldn't accuse him of having narrow interests. David Yelland, spotted as business editor of the Sun and the New York Post by Rupert Murdoch, knew what popular news was when Murdoch made him editor of the Sun.</p> <p>Murdoch, as ever, is relevant here. Since appointing Yelland, he has gone twice more to the business pages to find Times editors, taking Robert Thomson from the Financial Times and, having dispatched Thomson to run the Wall Street Journal, lifting up Harding. The Barclay brothers have looked to business journalism too, hiring Lewis, then business editor of the Sunday Times, to run the Daily Telegraph, and Patience Wheatcroft, running the Times business pages, to edit the Sunday Telegraph. </p> <p>Understandably, this love affair with business journalists has appalled all those generalists, foreign experts and political specialists who fancied their chances of getting to the top. Why do proprietors fall for City staff?</p> <p>Well, modern proprietors tend not to like meeting staff. If they must, it's nicer being with those who talk their language, know their friends and show proper respect for money. That makes City editors good company. They get ample \"face time\" and can use it to impress their bosses with their business acumen. These are men and women who understand business, who know why the proprietor wants to make a profit, who are up for more economical ways of running a paper. When you've talked to prospective editors who bang on about journalistic standards and demand large budgets, what a relief it must be to find one who understands it's all about running a business.</p> <p>But this is not to say that business journalists are all the same. Harding and Lewis are friends, but operate differently. Close observers of the pair say they show as editors the traits they exhibited as reporters - Harding is interested in the big themes, Lewis in stories. The Times editor has been taking his paper upmarket. Like Thomson before him, he is interested in the geopolitical, so the financial crisis is the kind of territory he likes. He's been writing his own elegant leaders - some staff have been moaning that they read like his columns, only without the byline.</p> <p>Over at the Telegraph, Lewis cuts a less cerebral, more excitable figure. If Harding is attempting to restore a certain authority around the Times as a newspaper, Lewis is going for a broader target, the Telegraph as a multimedia news brand. As far as business coverage is concerned, he and his even more experienced editor-at-large Jeff Randall favour a noisy approach that can feel like sports reporting. For all its broadsheet clothing, those of us who worked there always recognised that the Telegraph was brasher than it let on - these days it has ratcheted up the brashness. </p> <p>I'm clearly getting old, for I think the Telegraph's best piece on the crisis so far came from Charles Moore, a counter-intuitive column taking to task the archbishops of Canterbury and York for criticising short-sellers. Don't be surprised. Moore talks to smart people and comes back with stories. He was the one who brought in the revelation that Barings Bank was collapsing, back in the days when banks didn't.</p> <p>We know the financial crisis is serious, but I wonder whether some Times and Telegraph readers - largely people who have paid off their mortgages and benefit from final-salary pension schemes - wonder if the world is really ending. </p> <p>We can't leave without mentioning the man who now acts as the nation's financial guide. Robert Peston had a sticky start at the BBC. He was, it seemed, a man with the perfect voice for print and every TV and radio presenter developed an impression of him for social use. Randall, his predecessor at the BBC, had created an effective role as the man who explained business to ordinary people. Peston seemed unnecessarily cerebral by comparison. Happily, he has triumphantly fulfilled the traditional role of newspaper journalists going into broadcast, which is getting stories. Those complacent telly faces aren't laughing now.</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street has been branded \"The Street of $creams\" by the New York Post, and grim-faced US pundits talk nightly of mayhem in the markets. \"Tonight, breaking news,\" drawled CNN's septuagenarian host Larry King the other night. \"Wall Street takes another nose dive. Investors panic. Should you?\" </p> <p>While investors are certainly panicking, there's little doubt that the sharp suits and smooth talkers of Madison Avenue - shorthand for the city's advertising industry - are also bracing themselves for the effect of consumers tightening their belts. </p> <p>Yet if the prospects for advertising look worse than they have in decades, a few minutes in the company of Shelly Lazarus, the chairman and chief executive of WPP-owned Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide - whose clients include IBM, Dove, Cisco, Motorola and American Express - will have you questioning your assumptions. Exuding the old-school charm and self-assurance of a seasoned politician, Lazarus acknowledges the volatility of the current climate while insisting that the authoritative voice of the marketer needs to be heard through the clamour. </p> <p>\"There's panic right now, but I think when you have a situation like this, reassuring the public is a very important role we can play as communicators,\" she says, measuring her words carefully. </p> <p>\"It can take the form of the full-page advertisements we're seeing in the Wall Street Journal right now, which say, 'This institution is fine', or it could just be email messages or letters. But from the institutions you trust - or used to trust - where you've put your money, I do think it's important for someone to come forward and say: 'Your money's OK. This is not the Great Depression and you don't have to go and withdraw all your funds!'\" </p> <p>But what of the balance sheet in Lazarus's own industry? America's advertising sector was already expecting a torrid year, with ad spending down in the first half of 2008, before the Wall Street crisis began. How does she think the current turbulence will affect Ogilvy's business? </p> <p>\"We've had a very strong performance so far this year, but it's got to happen that, in this kind of environment, clients will start to look at whether they can pull back a bit,\" she replies cagily. \"And we are starting to see it. It's not significant for any one company - and I actually do think that companies know the smart ones continue to spend through recessionary times, because you can pick up market share ...\" She snatches a quick breath. \"But, having said that, if you have 20 clients who each cut a million bucks from their advertising budgets in the fourth quarter, then you've got a problem. So, yes, I do think there will be an impact for us in the fourth quarter.\" </p> <p>In fact, the banking crisis has already hit Ogilvy's bottom line. A few days after this interview, it emerged that Wachovia, the troubled US bank that was acquired a week ago by Citigroup, had \"paused\" its decision to award its advertising business to a group of agencies owned by WPP, led by Ogilvy. As Citigroup has an existing arrangement with other agencies, this development is thought likely to leave Ogilvy out in the cold. With Lazarus away in India when the news broke, the agency declined to comment. </p> <p>Some industry analysts have speculated that the big advertising corporations - with their high staffing levels and prestigious offices in several cities - will find it harder to weather the economic storm than leaner \"boutique\" agencies. But Lazarus, whose 40-year career has stretched from the tail-end of the Mad Men era to today's brave new(ish) world of digital marketing, says everyone will find the going tough. \"I think everybody's going to be hit because of this focus [by clients] on keeping a sharp eye on costs.\" </p> <p>The retail market, she predicts, will be affected by American consumers waiting for things to settle. \"People are just hunkering down at the moment. Even if you have money, it doesn't feel appropriate to spend it right now. It's not the dollars, it's the mindset. Any big expenditure that can be postponed is being looked at as discretionary. So instead they're staying home, watching TV. Sales of salty snacks are up. When I last checked, the sale of wine was up. And the cable companies - as of two weeks ago - say no one's cutting back at all.\" </p> <p>One of the most prominent figures in US advertising, Rochelle B Lazarus was born in Brooklyn in 1947. She was one of just four women in her MBA class at Columbia University and joined Ogilvy when advertising was still very much a booze-fuelled club for boys. She also arrived at a time when the firm's founder - the industry colossus David Ogilvy - still walked its corridors, proclaiming the importance of brand-building through creativity. </p> <p>Lazarus, who is married to a paediatrician, Dr George Lazarus, and has three grown-up children, is credited with, among many other things, landing IBM as an exclusive client in 1994 - luring the corporate giant away from 70 agencies worldwide. She has a reputation for playing hardball and a steely personality is said to lurk beneath the controlled charm. </p> <p>\"I would say Shelly's been the most effective person, never mind woman, in the New York advertising world in the last decade,\" says an executive from another agency. \"She knows exactly what she wants and how to get it. She's achieved everything she set out to achieve. But there's nothing Sex and the City about her, if you know what I mean. She's too respectable, too poised.\"</p> <p>In January, Lazarus - who is on the board of a host of organisations ranging from General Electric to the American Museum of National History - will step down as CEO, although she will remain chairman. \"I'll still be a full-time working chairman,\" she stresses quickly, in case there was any lingering doubt. </p> <p>So what are the biggest changes Lazarus, who will be replaced as chief executive by Miles Young, who has been running Ogilvy's Asia Pacific operation, has seen over her four decades in the trade? \"When I started in this business, if you had two television commercials, three print ads, some radio and a little bit of outdoor [billboards], that was something in those days,\" she recalls. \"And if you look at who was working in ad agencies in the Mad Men days and you see who's here now ... it's people from all over the world now, the number of women is far higher. And everything in this business has a global perspective now. We run global accounts out of Beijing and Bangalore, we never used to do that.\" </p> <p>Today, says Lazarus, clients expect \"big ideas\" expressed across an array of media platforms. \"There's not just an openness, but a hunger to see what's possible. There's almost disappointment when you bring a client a media plan that looks like something they would have seen two years ago. They want new ideas. They want to know how to deal with the blogosphere.\" </p> <p>What does she make of the advertising potential of the social networking phenomenon, particularly Facebook? \"The issue there is, 'Yes, it's a big, big thing, but how do you advertise on it?'.</p> <p>We've yet to figure out how to make [social networking platforms] commercial vehicles, because there's no question of their role in people's lives. But what is the killer advertising application? </p> <p>\"I'm not convinced banner ads and display ads do all that much. There are guys in the business who will show you those great charts, which say that people spend 20% of their time online and those dumb advertisers only spend 4% of their budgets there. Well, not so fast. How many times do you click on a display ad when you're online? And if you're not doing it and your friends aren't doing it, then you have to ask, who is? I think what the next few years are all about is figuring out how you advertise on the internet beyond display ads.\" </p> <p>But if she thinks Facebook's moment as an effective advertising platform has yet to arrive, she's convinced that \"branded content\" - a term that refers to brands playing an active role in TV drama or made-for-web video, rather than old-style product placement - is an increasingly important part of what advertising agencies do. </p> <p>\"We've had the experience with Pond's [skin cream] in this TV show called The Starter Wife. You don't realise it, but there's always a moment in the show when, just as the lead character [played by the Will &amp; Grace star Debra Messing], who's taking life on again after her husband has left her for another woman, goes out into the world, she actually puts Pond's on her face. Now, that is a really cool thing for a brand. It says, 'I'm all set, I'm ready to go and take on the world.' </p> <p>\"This is part of the future of advertising. All parts of the media are coming together. One of the things we're doing in Singapore for Johnnie Walker is video-cams in bars. You can check out 25 different bars in Singapore at any one given moment and decide which one you want to go to. </p> <p>\"These days if you can think it, you can do it,\" she explains. \"People shouldn't wring their hands and worry about how fast everything's changing. I always think that it's so much more interesting when we do things that have never been done before.\" She laughs. \"That can be pretty wild, actually.\" </p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae </strong><br><strong>Age</strong> 61<br><strong>Education</strong> Smith College (BA), Columbia University (MBA)<br><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1970</strong> Clairol, assistant product manager<br><strong>1971</strong> Ogilvy &amp; Mather, account executive<br><strong>1987</strong> O&amp;M Direct, general manager, then president<br><strong>1991</strong> O&amp;M New York, president<br><strong>1994</strong> President of O&amp;M North America; won IBM as an exclusive client<br><strong>1995</strong> O&amp;M Worldwide, chief operations officer and president<br><strong>1996</strong> O&amp;M CEO, then chairman<br><strong>2008</strong> Announced retirement as CEO.

  "<p>Margaret Ringenberg died in her sleep, aged 87, after a day at the Experimental Aircraft Association fly-in at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, during which she inspected new planes and met other veteran women pilots. She used to say of them: \"The girls may be dragging an oxygen bottle along, but they're just as noisy as they were in world war two ... they're still that satisfied-type person.\" Margaret was satisfied, too. She loved to be in the air, and she had been up there all her life.</p> <p>Born Margaret Ray and raised on the family farm in Indiana, she had her first ride off a nearby cornfield when she was eight, with a barnstormer who offered a flip in the air for a few cents. That planted the seed, although she did not think women were allowed to be pilots. Her post-high-school idea was to earn enough in a factory job at General Electric to study nursing, which would qualify her to be a stewardess - they were all medically trained in early passenger aviation. Then she wondered who would keep the craft in the air if an accident happened to a pilot, and told her father she wanted to learn to fly. Silence. A week later, she tried again. He explained how much it would cost and where to do it - Smith Field, Fort Wayne; once aloft, she no longer wanted to be a stewardess. She went solo at 19, and soon had her licence. After Pearl Harbor, the government sent female pilots a telegram telling them they were needed, not in combat, but to ferry planes and to teach. Her father said that he had not served, and he did not have sons, so she would be the family member on active duty.</p> <p>The Wasps - Women Airforce Service Pilots - did the same training as male cadets, but were not officially military; they took craft off factory production lines, test flew them, and delivered them across the US and Canada. Margaret, at 5ft 4in, was two inches too short to be first pilot on large planes - B-24, C-54, DC-3; on these, she was co-pilot. Aboard everything else, and Wasps handled more than 70 types, she was boss. </p> <p>Wasps ferried seriously damaged planes to be repaired or to be cannibalised for parts. An engine blew up in Margaret's battered craft on one lonely, risky boneyard run. She was ordered to parachute clear, but she still had control of the plane and landed it safely on the nearest airfield. Wasps also towed targets for live-ammo gunnery practice; Margaret sewed targets, and her clothes, on the hangar machines.</p> <p>By 1944, Wasps were no longer needed. Margaret, who was \"devastated\", returned home and stashed her gear in the attic. She got it out again for a parade, felt the thrill, returned to Smith Field, earned her flight instructors' rating and taught privately. She had logged the most hours at Smith but didn't have many pupils. \"You know, a girl pilot wasn't real popular.\" So she answered phones, mowed the yard, worked in the shop, anything. When Japan was about to surrender in August 1945, she dropped 56,000 leaflets across the state announcing the end of war.</p> <p>In 1946, she married a banker, Morris Ringenberg, whom she met while they were on war service. They had a son, Michael, and a daughter, Marsha (who qualified for her licence at 17, and was often co-pilot to her mother). Margaret taught a little, then in the 1950s began to race. Her success filled two rooms in the family home floor to ceiling with hundreds of trophies: she entered every Powder Puff Derby from 1957 to 1977, and every women's Air Race Classic, the Derby's successor, from 1977 to this summer, when she finished third - she was always in the top 10, and won in 1988. There were also the Grand Prix, Kentucky Air Derby, Denver Mile High and many others, and, for a lark, she flew round the world as co-pilot to a Californian doctor.</p> <p>Margaret stopped counting after she had logged more than 40,000 flying hours by 1994. That year she headed a team of two other veterans in a tiny Cessna 340, the \"Spirit of '76\", in the Round the World Air Race. All three were members of the Ninetynines, an association started by Amelia Earhart in 1929 to change the rules that blocked lift-off to females. Their radio died mid-Atlantic, they were blown off course by a typhoon, they were tracked by F-14 jets over Iran (and had headscarves ready should they be forced to land). Everywhere they had to lower their voices to male levels to get attention from air traffic controllers. They came in last, but most-applauded.</p> <p>Margaret raced from London to Sydney in 2001. She went for a spin at 180mph around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Circuit in 2004, and, as guest of Nasa, piloted the space shuttle simulator in 2002. But she had no taste for instrument flying: at last June's classic she advised her co-pilot to \"feel\" take-off and listen to the pitch of cockpit gadgets. </p> <p>She co-wrote her story, Girls Can't Be Pilots (1998), and her daughter told it again in Maggie Ray, WWII Air Force Pilot (2007). The honours and ovations culminated with her invitation to represent the Wasps at the dedication of the air force memorial in Washington, DC in 2006.</p> <p>Morris died in 2003. Margaret's children, and five grandchildren, all of whom had been aboard as she raced, survive her.</p> <p>\u2022 Margaret Ray Ringenberg, pilot, born June 17 1921; died July 28 2008</p>",
  "<p>Two European governments last night helped shore up the continent's banking system as the contagion of banking failure swept across the Atlantic to engulf Germany, Italy, Belgium and Iceland and threatened to destabilise markets today.</p> <p>A day of crisis talks in Berlin saw ministers, commercial banks and the central bank agree on a \u20ac50bn (\u00a339bn) package to rescue Germany's second-biggest property lender, Hypo Real Estate (HRE), after an earlier \u20ac35bn deal collapsed.</p> <p>Then it emerged that Belgium's makeshift government under Yves Leterme had helped broker a deal to secure the future of Fortis, the country's second-biggest bank, by selling 75% of its Belgian operations to BNP Paribas. France's biggest bank is also taking over two-thirds of Fortis's Luxembourg business. </p> <p>Less than a day after the EU's top four leaders agreed that no sound bank would be allowed to go under but rejected a US-style bail-out plan, crisis talks began early in the capitals of the four countries and continued all day.</p> <p>In Iceland, the government was still spearheading talks late last night with Nordic central bankers on a \u20ac10bn capital injection into the island's commercial banks, including leader Kaupthing, while in Italy Unicredit, the country's second-biggest bank, negotiated a fresh capital injection of up to a reported \u20ac6bn.</p> <p>The scale of the contagion had been highlighted by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who led opposition to French ideas for a pan-European bail-out plan, when she said Germany would not allow one bank's distress to poison the country's entire banking system. HRE, with links to Ireland's Depfa and Dexia, a Franco-Belgian municipal lender bailed out last week with a \u20ac6.4bn injection, was a key player in the \u20ac900bn property bond market.</p> <p>The German finance ministry said last night that HRE had been saved with no extra burden to the taxpayer, an extra \u20ac15bn credit facility being provided in the main by commercial banks.</p> <p>Merkel and Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, her finance minister, had earlier flayed the bank's board for disclosing a huge new liquidity hole, and other banks originally due to support it for pulling out. Both leaders insisted that the management of threatened banks could be made to pay for their costly mistakes with sanctions.</p> <p>After an emergency summit of the EU's British, French, German and Italian leaders in Paris on Saturday, President Nicolas Sarkozy said executives and shareholders would be \"punished\" if states were forced to bail out their institutions by pouring in billions of capital and liquidity.</p> <p>In Brussels, according to Luxembourg government sources, Leterme secured a last-minute deal to save Fortis. Last weekend Fortis, which over-reached itself last year by paying \u20ac24bn for key parts of Dutch rival ABN Amro, was bailed out with a \u20ac11.2bn injection from Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg in a partial nationalisation.</p> <p>But money haemorrhaged out of the bancassurer, with the Dutch government on Friday taking full control of its Dutch business, including ABN, and leaving the Belgian rump exposed to investor panic.</p> <p>On Saturday the four EU leaders insisted it was up to national governments to solve their countries' banking crisis but the potential cross-border effects of national decisions would have to be taken into account, with rescue efforts coordinated. The scale of the crisis in individual countries appeared to have undone that collective will.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Who else has introduced 100% deposit guarantees?</strong></p> <p>Ireland: Dublin sparked anger a week ago when it guaranteed all deposits in the six biggest Irish banks for the next two years. Critics have warned that the guarantee risked bankrupting the entire republic, while other European governments and banks complained it could breach EU state aid rules and distort competition. The pledge covers deposits in the UK Post Office savings account, which is run by Bank of Ireland. The scheme could be widened to include others including Ulster Bank, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>Ireland had previously guaranteed bank deposits up to \u20ac20,000, which it had raised to \u20ac100,000 just weeks ago.</p> <p>Greece: the Greek finance minister said on Thursday that deposits in \"all banks that operate in Greece\" would be \"absolutely guaranteed\" following an emergency cabinet meeting on how to insulate the country from the global financial crisis. Under existing law, the Greek government guarantees just the first \u20ac20,000 of savers' deposits. </p> <p>The minister, George Alogoskoufis, sought to assuage growing signs of nervousness in Greece, reassuring the public that the country's banks remained \"safe and solvent\".</p> <p><strong>... and who might be next?</strong></p> <p>Though it is unclear which governments might be tempted to offer a sweeping guarantee, Britain last week said it would raise it on savings from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 to bolster confidence and stem a flood of money into Irish banks. France, which had been rumoured to be following Ireland's lead, is already one of the most generous in Europe, guaranteeing \u20ac70,000. </p> <p>The Netherlands guarantees \u20ac40,000 and most of Europe, including Italy and Spain, guarantees \u20ac20,000. Some of the most exposed banks are in Belgium and Denmark, while panic selling hit shares in Italy's biggest bank, Unicredit.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration has given a US thinktank the go-ahead to open an office in Iran, in a departure from its strict policy of isolating the Islamic regime.</p> <p>Clearance was given to the American-Iranian Council amid reports that the White House has shelved plans to open a de facto embassy in Tehran. There was concern that it could affect the US presidential election in being seen as a reward for Iran's hawkish president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has defied UN demands to suspend the country's uranium enrichment programme.</p> <p>The council, a body of academics and former diplomats based in Princeton, New Jersey, was granted a one-year licence by the US treasury's office of foreign assets control, which scrutinises American contacts with Iran for breaches of government-sponsored sanctions.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad is understood to have indicated support when he met the council's senior members while in New York last month to attend the UN general assembly. </p> <p>The council, which was founded in 1997, has arranged for prominent American academics and business figures to meet Ahmadinejad during his various visits to the US. Its president, Hooshang Amirahmadi - a joint US-Iranian citizen - is currently in Tehran seeking authorisation from Iranian officials. A final decision is expected in the coming days, with hardliners voicing opposition.</p> <p>Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chairman of the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy committee, yesterday called for the application to be rejected after dismissing Amirahmadi as an \"insignificant representative\" of the US government. \"The Americans have already asked for dialogue on several levels, but this has not been accomplished because of their stances, so permitting such a person to open a bureau in Tehran does not accord with our national interests,\" he told the student news agency, ISNA.</p> <p>The council argues that its initiative would ease contacts between officials and legislators and could eventually lead to normalised relations between the two countries. </p> <p>Brent Lollis, its executive director, said the application was separate from the US state department's proposal to open a diplomatic interests section in Tehran. \"It's important to communicate the distinction between what the US government is doing and what we are doing,\" he said. \"Are we going to provide services that will be useful to diplomats and legislators? Yes. But we are not a substitute [for a diplomatic interests section] because the state department makes its own decision. We should be able to operate in Iran in the same way as we operate in the US. </p> <p>\"By being based in Tehran, we should be able to arrange a wider array of meetings. We are positioning ourselves to help any parties that may want to speak to each other.\"</p> <p>Plans for a US special interest section in Tehran were disclosed by the Guardian last July in what would mark the first American diplomatic presence in Iran since ties were severed in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>However, that proposal has been thrown into doubt after AP, citing unnamed Bush administration officials, reported that it had been put on hold until the next US president takes office.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said the proposal remained on the table but that no decision had been taken. \"I think it's an interesting idea, but we're going to take a look at it in the light of what it can do for our relationship with the Iranian people,\" she told reporters.</p>",
  "<p>The future for the BBC lies in the technology that can open it up to the world, just as technology gave it life last century. In the corporate world, Facebook, Apple and Google have launched platform services that allow external developers and companies to build services using their code - but the BBC is uniquely placed to use those same principles to create a cultural and commercial resource for the nation.</p> <p>The director general Mark Thompson has directed the corporation to think beyond proprietary rights management to a new era of interoperability that offers consumers wider choice, control and benefits from \"network effects\" - the virality and interconnectedness of the web.</p> <p>In post-Hutton 2004, startup investor and former BBC strategy manager Azeem Azhar proposed a \"BBC Public Licence\" that would allow both the public and business to use BBC content and code to build on, play with and share. It seems his vision is finally coming to life. \"Four years on, the BBC is in a much stronger position to do this,\" says Azhar. \"It has the opportunity to create a new ecosystem, just as MySQL [the open source database system], as a platform, created an ecosystem around itself.\"</p> <p>Steve Bowbrick, recently commissioned to initiate a public debate about openness at the corporation, thinks empowerment could be as important as the traditional Reithian mantra, \"Educate, inform and entertain.\"</p> <p>\"The broadcast era is finished,\" he says. \"The BBC needs to provide web tools and a new generation of methods and resources that will boost [its] capital, but that will also use the BBC as a platform for promoting the individuals, organisations and businesses that make up UK plc.\"</p> <p>What could the BBC create? It sits on a vast content resource, much of which is already being digitised under the BBC Archive scheme. It will take until 2022 to digitise material around each programme, from transcripts, audio, D notices and expenses to letters of complaint. The most significant part of the archive - 900,000 hours of TV and radio programmes - is likely to be the last thing to be digitised because of the complex rights issues.</p> <p>BBC internet controller Tony Ageh says the notion of a dusty archive is now redundant; in the web era, everything is permanent and everything is, or should be, accessible. He says the BBC should be seen as not simply a programme-maker or a distributor, but as both. \"There must be a way to achieve both of these outcomes, without harming the BBC, that would massively increase the viability of some SMEs and invigorate the entire UK ecosystem. Given what's going on in the world, this would be a very good time for such an injection of resources and support.\"</p> <p>The iPlayer is one technology that could be opened up so that startups could build complementary services around it. In regional news, the BBC could make all its video reports, audio, text and comments available to commercial rivals and trigger a renaissance in local journalism. And it could allow people to remix BBC news footage for themselves, perhaps for a \"day you were born\" birthday present or a significant football match.</p> <p>This new commitment to openness demands both a full and direct conversation with people outside the BBC, and a substantial technological commitment. The BBC has begun to initiate a more open debate through blogs, but generally its communications are ferociously managed through conventional PR. </p> <p>The BBC has a number of initiatives including Innovation Labs, during which the BBC works with content-focused startups; Backstage, which offers a selection of BBC content for developers to build with; and the hack festival Mashed. It has already dabbled with a new generation of more flexible, web-native licence agreements, releasing its video compression technology Dirac as an open-source project. The licence means its code is available for free to be reused and improved. Mike Butcher, editor of TechCrunch UK, has reinvigorated this discussion in the startup sector. \"People ask why there aren't more startups in the UK, but much of our talent is inside the BBC. The BBC should be the place that reflects the cultural life of our nation and that should include our technological innovation.\"</p> <p>Bowbrick's enthusiasm for openness is tempered by his conviction that the UK startup scene is not ready for the tsunami of material that the BBC could unleash. </p> <p>\"We're really in the first seconds of the first hour of all this,\" he says. \"We always assume we're later than we are, but really - the second era of the BBC starts here.\"</p>",
  "<p>For a club sponsored by a company that manufactures satellite navigation devices, Middlesbrough have shown an unfortunate propensity to lose their way on their travels. If a first League away win of 2008 suggested an improved sense of direction, their road to victory nonetheless encompassed some unlikely turns and bemused the Wigan manager, Steve Bruce, who deemed the first half \"one-way traffic\".</p> <p>It was gridlock thereafter until J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re, who appeared to have found reverse gear this season by moving from attack into midfield, delivered a late winner. Courtesy of a new-look back four, Middlesbrough managed their first clean sheet of the campaign while suggesting they have taken a circuitous path to defensive excellence.</p> <p>Jonathan Grounds and Chris Riggott have taken detours, via a loan spell at Norwich and the reserves respectively, but in harness with the excellent David Wheater, they repelled Wigan's attacks. \"It's a big step in the right direction for me and the club,\" said Riggott. Once a reported target for Liverpool, he finished last season on loan at Stoke. Riggott has started only 16 of 83 Premier League games during Gareth Southgate's tenure but on Saturday he dovetailed with Wheater in a display of defiance to thwart Emile Heskey and Amr Zaki that drew admiration from Bruce.</p> <p>Southgate made a meaningful contribution of his own, incorporating a third central midfielder at half time to contain the free-running Wilson Palacios, Middlesbrough marrying unyielding resolve with tactical flexibility as 4-4-2 became 4-5-1. Southgate added: \"We've got players who are adaptable to those sorts of changes.\"</p> <p>Practising shooting had been a priority for a previously profligate team last week. Reward came in the form of Aliadi\u00e8re's smooth strike, swept in after Stewart Downing headed a cross from the influential substitute Didier Digard into his path. \"The only chance we got, we scored,\" said Aliadi\u00e8re, who punished Wigan and those, including the Blackburn-bound Fabio Capello, who favoured an early exit. </p> <p>Yet there was a predictability to the denouement, if not the identity of the victor; all four of Middlesbrough's away games have been determined in the last five minutes. \"We've lost too many games to late goals ourselves in the past,\" added Riggott. \"That is the worst feeling.\" At the JJB Stadium, however, Aliadi\u00e8re provided the three-point turn on the road.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match: </strong>David Wheater (Middlesbrough)</p>",
  "<p><strong>Whenever I put on my golfing outfit (striped shirt, smart trousers) my girlfriend laughs at me. How can I make her stop?</strong><br>Bruce Lane, Cornwall</p> <p>Whether it's an indictment on this page or the nature of fashion in general, it is remarkable how many of the questions that arrive by winged courier to this hallowed desk of academia contain their own answer within. To whit, last week L Grant wanted to know why it was so hard to find smart long-sleeved dresses for the over-30s (because you're over 30. Duh! Designers don't care about you. Go float yourself out on an iceberg or something!)</p> <p>Now we have a gentleman wanting to know why his long-suffering (one presumes) lady friend finds his golfing outfit amusing. I shall speak slowly and use words with no more than two syllables, Bruce: because it's a golfing outfit. Golfing. Outfit - two words that should never go together, like \"Madonna's guru\" or \"strawberry condoms\".</p> <p>The first problem is your belief that you need an outfit at all. Why? Most sporting uniforms are there for protection or easy identification of fellow teammates should a scrum occur. </p> <p>Neither of these considerations is generally necessary when it comes to golfing, save, perhaps, for the odd, stray flying ball. Yet as Confucius say, pastel trousers do not head-protection make. So what is the appeal of pastel trousers and striped shirts, worn from Miami Beach to St Andrews? People only wear uniforms by choice to be identified as part of a group. Now, while there is nothing wrong with advertising your penchant for a seven-iron (or whatever), this particular ensemble is anachronistic and therefore associated with some of golf's less appealing history, such as overpriced G&amp;Ts and movies starring Kevin Costner. You know all the hoo-hah about Tiger Woods making the sport \"modern\"? Well, look at what he's wearing, sunny Jim. Not pastel trousers. Coincidence? No sirree.</p> <p>But there's no need to get to psychological about this because, really, the problem is an aesthetic one. Think of those 1950s adverts for something called \"gentleman's slacks\" in which a man bearing a strong resemblance to Richard Madeley poses with a smile - and often next to a window through which you can see some larking children and a woman bearing a smile so demented she appears to be high. The man is wearing a V-neck jumper of some sort and trousers of a fertility-affecting, high-waisted cut. They generally have a sharp crease ironed in them for, one can only presume, <br>Masonic purposes. You sometimes see these adverts revived for satirical intentions in magazines (or, if you're a reader of the Daily Telegraph on weekends, on the newspaper's very own pages). Anyway Bruce, that's you, that is. You hear that sound in the background? That's me and your girlfriend, cackling as one.</p> <p><strong>Are Lynx and other such deodorants a good idea, or do they make us smell like 17-year-olds who are trying too hard?</strong><br>Christopher (17), by email</p> <p>Oh, my sweet, sweet boy. Come here and, as the great Tony Mortimer put it in the seminal East 17 song, Deep, rest upon my chest. What a mental torment you've been enduring, so just listen to my soothing words: yes - such deodorants do make you smell like an idiot. There, there. </p> <p>I just don't get it, I really don't. Yes, I grasp the idea that gaggingly scented bodysprays and deodorants serve as a pubescent induction into the world of perfume, but whereas most women give up the Impulse by the age of, um, 15, men cling on to Lynx for an overpoweringly long time. </p> <p>But the real problem with Lynx is not so much the smell or the long-term dependency, it's the proof that you have been taken in by one of the most bafflingly successful advertising campaigns of the modern age. The frankly laughable suggestion that making one's entire body and the 50 yard radius around it smell of something called Lynx Touch will make the ladies faint with desire as opposed to projectile vomit has become sweetly, implausibly and <br>distressingly engrained in today's male psyche. And then there's that one in which the man is made of chocolate, like some nightmarish combined image from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Heavenly Creatures - what the hell is THAT about? Is that an aspirational image?</p> <p>Christopher, listen to me. Imagine a life, a lonely life, in which you stay in every Saturday night, playing alone on your Playstation while your flatmate <br>is out on a date with his lovely girlfriend, leaving you to wonder why every woman you encounter sub-consciously sees you as a greasy-haired, crusty-skinned loutish fool, even if actually you're a lovely, handsome, smart and caring kinda guy. </p> <p>Now that's what I call the Lynx effect.</p>",
  "<p>It's not Old Labour. It's not quite New Labour. It's Emergency Labour. Over the past few days Gordon Brown has, in effect, joined the coup against himself. He has brought key Blairites into the heart of government and disbanded the least popular parts of his own operation. This will keep him as prime minister at least through the winter - and probably until the election.</p> <p>The key to what has happened might be called the two desperation strategies. Brown knew very well that up to five cabinet ministers were on the verge of resignation just as soon as there was a lull in the economic storm. During the summer, he had been talking privately to Peter Mandelson and Alastair Campbell. They, plus Tony Blair himself - who was with Mandelson when Gordon Brown's call to that meeting came - provided the crucial bridge to this dramatic reshaping of the government.</p> <p>Brown realised that only something as dramatic as the return of Mandelson and, behind the scenes, Campbell too, could stall a coup. It won't have delighted the public, for whom both are bogeymen, and it has infuriated the Labour left. But it was the price he had to pay - his desperation strategy.</p> <p>It only worked because of David Miliband's disastrous Labour conference, which convinced hardcore Blairites that he was not a runner. He made mistakes - not least in failing to spot an eavesdropping journalist. But really, he was the victim of a brutal political ambush. The Brownites were out to get him. The Labour left was out to get him. And crucially, the Tories and the Tory press were out to get him too. Miliband had been identified as a real threat; all those anti-Miliband jokes prepared for Birmingham shows what might have been. Then along he walks, all by himself, smiling owlishly and holding a banana. You have to feel sorry for somebody who remains one of the brightest rising stars.</p> <p>Nor is it over for him in the longer term. Yes, many others are back in the running, too, including his younger brother (though as one cabinet minister says: \"Ed will have to be careful. As soon as they think he's installing telephone lines, they'll catch him carrying an apple.\") But the key fact is that any leadership challenge is off for now. </p> <p>The Blairites' desperation strategy, shorn of a candidate, has become let's stick with Brown and make him better. Whether it's Miliband, James Purnell or Ed Balls in future, they know that, for now, electoral oblivion looms and they need to mitigate the scale of the defeat.</p> <p>Internally, the most obvious losers are the left. Brown desperately wanted Jon Cruddas inside the tent, but again he asked for too much - a party management role. He therefore keeps himself in play for a G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung leadership fight after an election defeat. But by refusing to roll up his sleeves and join Emergency Labour, he has lost authority in the short term. The appointment of Jon Trickett as Brown's parliamentary private secretary is interesting, though. It shows how keen the prime minister is on keeping his lines open to Compass, the left-of-centre group which had such a successful conference.</p> <p>In these desperate circumstances, the left's route to influence lies in working inside the tent, not standing outside while the gale blows. On that, at least, they could take a lesson from Blairites.</p> <p>The big question is whether any of this unlikely yoking of old enemies and rivals is going to work. The honest answer is that nobody has any idea. Another question is whether Brown can oversee a new atmosphere in Downing Street. He was forced to ditch his media man, Damian McBride, and his loyalist PPS Ian Austin, while clever and likable Steven Carter leaves, too, for a departmental job. But where will the centre of power be? You don't let people with the ambition and experience of Mandelson and Campbell near No 10 without expecting them to seize control.</p> <p>That means others, including Jack Straw, Harriet Harman (who knew about the Mandelson appointment only very late in the day), Alistair Darling and Ed Balls, must be biting their lips. The chancellor now has to cope not only with Mandelson as business minister but also Shriti Vadera advising Brown on economic policy. She already provokes sniping, and was the only minister to accompany Brown to key meetings in New York. (She is such a regular visitor to Chequers that one room is apparently called \"Shriti's room\".) All this may settle down amicably, but there are more ruffled feathers to smooth than Bernard Matthews has ever seen.</p> <p>The public message, of course, is of a more experienced, remodelled pro-business government to get through the economic crisis, in which rivalries have been put aside for the national good.</p> <p>Certainly, it is a more heavyweight one: Mandelson's mix of guile and menace in interviews shows what a formidable politician he can be. If, far behind in the polls, and facing an economic collapse, Emergency Labour can hold together, they may reap rewards in the short term.</p> <p>One of the shrewdest cabinet ministers warns however, that while \"everyone is dazzled by Mandy\", the real issue is \"whether Brown can now lead a team and get the best rather than the worst out of people\". Can a dysfunctional machine become a harmonious one? This can only happen if it is clearer where the machine is taking us. The immediate problems, though dramatic, are ideologically easy for Labour. Unlike the Tories, the party will have no trouble in deciding to use taxpayers' money to keep the economic system functioning, and to protect savers. If you look at the polls, the public wants Emergency Labour to see the country through this crisis.</p> <p>Labour's problem is that the polls are equally eloquent about what should happen next. After thanking Brown for quelling the storm, the public wants to boot him out. He can only deal with that by moving on from Emergency Labour and providing a sense of direction. That must involve not a return to the high-rolling, blandly optimistic and simplistically free-market New Labour of the boom years - Mandy Labour - but a move towards a more progressive Labourism for credit-crunch Britain, in which fairness is the guiding principle.</p> <p>This is Brown's only coherent story, and one he seemed to be telling in his conference speech. But I wonder whether Blairites rallying round understand where he will take them next. In short, who is holding who hostage? </p> <p>I don't know. Reader, you don't know. And, joy of joys, they don't know either. These have been an extraordinary few days. I think we have seen nothing yet. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Over morning newspapers with the Today programme in my ear, I eye my garden nervously. If I ripped up the roses and the lavender, how many rows of potatoes could I fit in? Enough to feed a family? Is this madness or not? And why is it that I no longer trust the economists and policymakers to give me a straight answer to that question?</p> <p>There is a strange air of suspense. Everyone agrees that things could get grim, but what does that mean? Grim, as in a bit of nasty unemployment, or grim, as in total economic breakdown with queues for soup kitchens and millions living off their allotments? If the latter sounds fanciful, there are countries like Argentina and Russia who can tell you from bitter recent experience what happens when economies collapse. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, fearful of \"self-fulfilling prophecies\", instead offers a tinny upbeat message. Everyone knows now that it is all about confidence: will savers panic and move their money to Ireland, crippling British banks? The circumspection of the wise men becomes sinister. On the Today programme, John Humphrys pressed Richard Lambert, director general of the CBI, for his forecast. Lambert hesitated, replying with, \"my hope is ...\". \"No, no,\" interrupted Humphrys, \"what is your forecast?\" There was another hesitation before Lambert nervously \"forecast\" a grim 18 months before life resumed as normal. It sounded like a hope. No one has any idea what is going to happen. </p> <p>No sooner do economists or government ministers make a pronouncement using words such as \"impossibility\", \"unlikely\" or \"never\", than they are having to eat them. If these are uncharted waters then perhaps we are at the moment when the tsunami is visible on the horizon, and the tide has suddenly retreated, and fish are stranded, gasping for oxygen all over the beach. </p> <p>But don't get too bogged down in seed catalogues (and forget trying to get your head around collateralised debt obligations - even the Financial Times's banking correspondents admit it is \"fiendishly complicated\"), the average citizen has a far more important plot to unravel: how did we get in this mess, and how do we make sure it doesn't happen again?</p> <p>Answering these two questions does not require a crash course in City finance and economics, because this crisis is as much about politics and ideology as anything. If you're pressed for time, the reading list can be very short. Key is Karl Polanyi's The Great Transformation, published in 1944, an economic history which sets out to explain 1929, the Great Depression and the rise of fascism. Polanyi's book came out the same year as another influential Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, brought out the central text of neoliberalism, The Road to Serfdom.</p> <p>Hayek became the founding father of a model of economic management which has brought us to the current crisis; Polanyi, with extraordinary prescience, warned that the crisis would come; he rejected the idea that the market is a \"self-regulating\" mechanism which can correct itself. There is no \"invisible hand\" such as the neoliberals maintain, so there is nothing inevitable or \"natural\" about the way markets work: they are always shaped by political decisions.</p> <p>At the time Polanyi was writing, there were many who agreed with him that free-market capitalism was chronically and destructively unstable, with terrible political consequences. But in the 70s and 80s, Hayek's neoliberalism began to take hold on the US ruling elite, Margaret Thatcher was recruited - and in due course Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. \"Roll back the state, leave the economy to run itself\" has held sway ever since. As Ann Pettifor points out on her website, debtonation.org, Alan Greenspan wrote enthusiastically in August that \"the past decade has seen mounting global forces (the international version of Adam Smith's invisible hand) quietly displacing government control of economic affairs\". He blithely continued that the greatest danger facing the economy was that \"some governments, bedevilled by emerging inflationary forces, will endeavour to reassert their grip on economic affairs\". Last week, Greenspan did a gigantic volte-face as he pleaded for government to do just that - reassert its grip in the form of the bail-out.</p> <p>We are now learning what countries across the developing world have experienced over three decades: unstable and inequitable neoliberal economics leads to unacceptable levels of social disruption and hardship that can only be contained by brutal repression. Add that to the two other central charges against deregulated capitalism: first, it may create wealth but it does not distribute it effectively; and second, that it takes no account of what it cannot commodify - neither the social relationships of family and community nor the environment, which are vital to human wellbeing, and indeed to the functioning of the market itself. Ultimately, neoliberal capitalism is self-destructive.</p> <p>We are now witnessing the collapse of this absurd economic orthodoxy that has dominated politics for nearly 30 years. Its triumphalist arrogance, its insistence on orthodoxy, has been comparable to Soviet communism in its scale. For two decades, we've been told \"Tina\" - \"There is no alternative\". </p> <p>Economists talk of trust, belief, faith; we now understand that all along neoliberal capitalism was a form of mythology. That's why the triumphalism was necessary - you could not afford to have anyone challenge the system or we might all realise we were gawping at the emperor's nakedness. Rowan Williams was right to quote Marx, that \"unbridled capitalism becomes a kind of mythology, ascribing reality, power and agency to things that have no life in themselves\". Richard Dawkins should be critiquing this superstitious belief system. </p> <p>Fortunately Thomas Frank did so in his brilliant book, One Market Under God (2001). This is the second book on the reading list, because it explains how neoliberalism entrenched its triumphalism into the political system of the US; how it marginalised and delegitimised all challenge and established hegemony in the so-called free world. </p> <p>Now, as it all totters, we can take stock. We can ask how and why the critique - of which Frank was a part and Polanyi the bible - which was emerging in the late 90s was crippled. The anti-globalisation movement argued that neoliberal capitalism was unjust, unstable and destructive to human and environmental wellbeing. Sounds sensible now, but at the time it mysteriously got smeared by association with anarchists with a penchant for smashing Starbucks' windows. The broad network of social grassroots movements - US unions, Mexican peasants, Indian farmers - were misnamed, misunderstood, ridiculed and ignored. There is no alternative, the politicians intoned mantra-like.</p> <p>Then 9/11 and for the next seven years a sideshow was offered as a distraction with caricature villains and thriller drama. While eyes were on the absurd charade of the \"threat of Islamist terrorism to western civilisation\", the real doomsday scenario that poses a far greater threat to western civilisation (whatever that is) was gathering pace right next to Ground Zero, in Wall Street. </p> <p>As in all mythologies, the only option, according to Timothy Garton Ash (not noted for his religious faith) on these pages recently, is to pray. What makes me frightened is that this is a corrupt mythology which, like that of the Aztecs, may require a lot of human sacrifice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.bunting@theguardian.com\">m.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>British police have been plagued by allegations of racism in the ranks for decades - from allegations in the 1950s that they harassed ethnic minorities to accusations in the 1970s that swingeing stop-and-search powers were used disproportionately against black and Asian British people.</p> <p>Years of denials of discrimination by police leaders were challenged by the Macpherson report, which found the service was institutionally racist.

It found that unwitting prejudice in part explained police bungling that allowed the killers to escape justice for the 1993 murder.</p> <p>The Black Police Association came to prominence after the Macpherson report as a body to support ethnic minority officers, who are under-represented in the police service, and who say they are less likely to be promoted and more likely to be unfairly targeted for internal investigation.</p>",
  "<p>Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth will launch a high court judicial review today to force the government to stand by promises made in 2000 to eradicate fuel poverty and help millions of households facing a winter of burgeoning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/householdbills\">gas and electricity bills</a>. </p> <p>The charities said the government was legally bound by promises it made in legislation passed in 2000, in which it undertook to abolish fuel poverty by 2016 and to eliminate it among the most vulnerable households by 2010. The hearing is scheduled to last two days, with a judgment expected within six weeks. </p> <p>Households in fuel poverty are defined as those in which more than 10% of income is spent on energy. But far from the numbers falling, the past year has seen a steep increase as gas and electricity bills have rocketed.</p> <p>Official figures last week showed that in 2006 3.5m households - 1m more than in 2005 - spent more than a 10th of their income on heating and power. The figure included 2.75m \"vulnerable\" households, such as those with children, elderly people or the long-term sick. </p> <p>Since then, Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth said the situation had deteriorated dramatically, following several hikes in tariffs by the major power suppliers. They estimate that as many as 5m households, many of them those of pensioners, now face a stark choice of \"heat or eat\". </p> <p>Mervyn Kohler, special adviser for Help the Aged, said: \"Though fuel poverty is high on the media and political agendas, government actions to reduce it fall far short of the crisis it is creating for millions of pensioners and low-income families.</p> <p>\"It is vital that the government comes up with an effective strategy for tackling fuel poverty. Low-income households need crisis payments simply to get through the coming winter, but in the longer term, the energy efficiency of our homes must be improved. The government has a legal duty to do this.\" </p> <p>The charities argue that the government has broken the law by not doing everything reasonably practicable to meet its fuel poverty targets. They claim the government has failed to provide a comprehensive and costed plan of action for meeting its targets; failed to set a minimum standard of energy efficiency for affected households, and ignored repeated criticism from the independent Fuel Poverty Advisory Group.</p> <p>Hilary Benn, environment minister, said the government was committed to tackling fuel poverty but \"sharply rising energy prices have made that goal increasingly difficult\".</p> <p>The government said tackling fuel poverty was a high-priority policy and that it had pledged \u00a31bn to help struggling householders. Since 2000, \u00a320bn had been spent on a range of benefits and programmes to improve fuel efficiency and help those in need of assistance.</p>",
  "<p>He is remembered as the obsessive love interest of Scarlett O'Hara in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">Gone with the Wind</a>, but Leslie Howard should also be recalled as a British secret agent who died returning from a clandestine war mission, claims a Spanish author.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Rey-X\u00edmena said that Howard, who was in a passenger aircraft shot down by the Luftwaffe in 1943, had just been to a secret meeting with General Franco, allegedly on a special mission for Winston Churchill, who wanted to get a secret message to the Spanish dictator.</p> <p>\"Thanks to him, at least in theory, Spain was persuaded to stay out of the war,\" Rey-X\u00edmena claimed of the actor famous for his portrayal of the unattainable southern gentleman Ashley Wilkes, in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind.</p> <p>The alleged message conveyed by Howard was just one of the British attempts to keep Franco, who had come to power with the support of Hitler and Mussolini, from joining the wartime Axis alliance, Rey-X\u00edmena said yesterday.</p> <p>Howard used his contacts with a former lover, Conchita Montenegro, to get through to Franco and deliver the message, the writer said. Montenegro, a Spanish actor, told Rey-X\u00edmena the full story of Howard's visit to Madrid shortly before her death at the age of 95 last year.</p> <p>Montenegro, once dubbed the Spanish Greta Garbo, allegedly had an affair with Howard whom she met while shooting Never the Twain Shall Meet in 1931. She later married Ricardo Gim\u00e9nez-Arnau, who was in charge of foreign relations for the far-right Falangist party, which backed Franco's military uprising against the Republican government. </p> <p>It was through her husband's family, whose members occupied several posts under Franco, that Howard managed to see Spain's ruler, the actor said.</p> <p>Montenegro told Rey-X\u00edmena that Howard's interview with Franco was supposedly about whether he would take the role of Columbus in a Spanish film. Franco was interested in cinema. The arrival in Madrid of a Hollywood star, at a time when Spain's rightwing dictatorship meant the country was widely shunned, caused a stir. Howard enraged British officials in Madrid, however, by refusing to attend many events organised for him. This, Montenegro said, was because he was preparing to meet Franco behind the back of the British ambassador.</p> <p>Rey-X\u00edmena, who has just published a book on the subject, has not revealed the full contents of the meeting. Howard left Madrid in June 1943 for Lisbon, and then boarded a DC-3 passenger airliner bound for London. The plane was intercepted off Spain by German fighters and went down in the Atlantic, killing all on board.</p> <p>A rumour later circulated that the Germans thought Churchill himself was on board. Howard's manager, who also died in the crash, was said to resemble the British war leader. </p> <p>Rey-X\u00edmena said Howard's secret went down with the plane: \"He has never been recognised either as a spy or as a hero.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Thomson of Monifieth, who has died aged 87, was a Labour cabinet minister who became a Liberal Democrat spokesman in the House of Lords. Earlier he had been appointed by a Conservative home secretary to chair the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), where he was a bold champion of the industry. He was also a Europhile who became the EEC regional affairs commissioner and later chairman of the European Movement. But despite it all, he often said the job that gave him greatest pleasure was as editor of the DC Thomson (no relation) comic, the Dandy.</p> <p>It was the skill that George Thomson displayed as chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority (1977-80) that led William Whitelaw to offer him the IBA, a post he held from 1981 to 1988. Other Conservative ministers were less conciliatory. In 1988 the foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, tried to persuade the IBA to block the showing of Death on the Rock, the Thames Television documentary that questioned the role of the SAS in the killing of three IRA terrorists in Gibraltar. But Thomson stood firm. Later, he attacked the Thatcher government's plans to auction off ITV contracts under the 1990 Broadcasting Act and also to establish a Broadcasting Standards Council under Sir William Rees-Mogg in 1988 to monitor decency, political impartiality and to pre-censor documentaries. He was also unhappy about her resistance to his attempts to secure a fair deal for his brainchild Channel 4. </p> <p>Thomson's career fell into clear segments. There were his 40 years in the Labour party, his time as MP for Dundee East (1952-72) and as a minister in Harold Wilson's governments, where Richard Crossman rated him an \"inoffensive makeweight\" and a Wilson \"henchman\". He moved away from politics during his time as a European commissioner (1973-77) and while chairing the ASA and the IBA. </p> <p>Thomson was born in Stirling, and brought up in Monifieth, a small town on the outskirts of Dundee. He was a leading scholar at Grove Academy, Dundee, but left at 16 to work as a local reporter with the DC Thomson group. He became chief subeditor - and, at 18, briefly editor - of the Dandy, then selling, it was said, around 500,000 copies. He spent the second world war in the RAF (1940-46).</p> <p>After the war his journalism switched from comics to conflict. The DC Thomson management demanded that he sign a pledge not to join a trade union, so he left and became assistant editor of Forward, a long-established, though shakily financed, socialist weekly paper in Glasgow. In 1948 he was made editor, but then the magazine moved to London, where it died in 1953. A year before that, Thomson had become MP for Dundee East, having contested hopeless Glasgow-Hillhead in 1950.</p> <p>As a Labour MP in 1955, Thomson was one of the first to back Sydney Silverman's attempt to abolish capital punishment. The following year he opposed Anthony Eden's Suez venture. In 1959 he was made Commonwealth and colonies spokesman by the Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell. In 1960, he supported the idea of \"collective defence under Nato, so long as the Communist countries keep their arms\", and dismissed the CND Aldermaston marches as \"an expression of adult neurosis\". In 1961-62 he opposed the Conservatives' Commonwealth Immigration Act, and also fought Tory moves to rush Britain into the EEC at the expense of the Commonwealth.</p> <p>Following Harold Wilson's narrow electoral victory in 1964, he was made a junior Foreign Office minister, a post he held for two years, during which he changed the FO style, answering questions in simple English. Except for a rebuff by Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, most of his overseas missions were successful. He was chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (1966-67) and joint minister of state at the FO (1967). In August 1967, he joined the cabinet as Commonwealth Secretary. He was heavily involved in the attempts to end Ian Smith's illegal white minority regime in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). </p> <p>After Labour lost power in 1970, he became shadow defence spokesman. But as prime minister Edward Heath's EEC negotiations moved towards success, Thomson fell out with Labour over its policy of a European entry referendum and in 1972 he resigned from the frontbench. That Euro-loyalty helped lead Heath to name him as an EEC commissioner.</p> <p>Thomson had been made a life peer in 1977 at the end of his EEC service and a knight of the Thistle in 1981. Seven years later, proclaiming that he would have left Labour for the Social Democratic party in 1981 had he not been obliged to remain neutral at the IBA, he joined the Liberal Democrats and later became spokesman on foreign affairs and broadcasting (1990-98). He had already taken on various directorships - at ICI, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Woolwich Equitable, among others. He also enjoyed becoming a trustee of Leeds Castle, because \"as a plebeian Scot, I never thought I might in my declining years become a laird of an English castle\".</p> <p>In the Lords he vented his disgust with the Tories \"disastrous\" policies on the poll tax and local government reform in Scotland. He urged ITV equality with the BBC. In 1997, he criticising Tony Blair for his \"very old-fashioned\" view of frontier controls. As chairman of the political honours scrutiny committee, he also wrote to Blair asking him to ensure that the Tory Lord Ashcroft was resident in Britain before he took up his seat. A member of the Nolan committee on standards in public life, he demanded an inquiry into party funding. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Grace, whom he married in 1948, and his daughters Caroline and Ailsa. </p> <h2>Roger Liddell writes:</h2> <p>George Thomson, my father-in-law, came from an ILP socialist background. All his life he remained true to the social democratic principles of internationalism, public service and equality of respect. He was a quintessentially Labour figure from a bygone age: a talented journalist who never got the chance to go to university, a party man elected for his home town in a famous but now forgotten byelection triumph. To rally working-class solidarity against any Conservative dismantling of the Attlee settlement, Labour taught the local kids to sing round the tenements: \"Vote, vote, vote for Geordie Thomson: he's the one who'll give ye ham and eggs. And if you don't go for him, we'll bash your winders in. And your mam'll never speak to ye any mare\". George's jubilant supporters carried him on their shoulders to the railway station. </p> <p>At Westminster he fell under the tutelage of his fellow Dundee member, ex-minister, ex-Bloomsburyite and old Etonian John Strachey. For a Scottish Labour member, he also took two very unScottish life-shaping decisions. First, he based his family in London, not Scotland - choosing to rent in Harlow new town. Second, he specialised in foreign affairs, working closely with Jim Callaghan on decolonisation (he was Jim's campaign manager for the leadership in 1963) and with Denis Healey on disarmament. Although a natural Gaitskellite, he and his wife, Grace, felt a social distance from the intellectual elitism of the Hampstead set. </p> <p>Harold Wilson chose George to do the initial soundings on Britain's 1967 application to join the Common Market: he was judged at the time a genuine sceptic, with no previous \"form\". But his conversion to passionate pro-Europeanism was to change his life again. I heard him give the speech of his life at Labour's special conference in July 1971, setting out why the entry terms to Europe that Edward Heath had negotiated were ones he would have recommended to a Labour cabinet. He became a firm ally of Roy Jenkins, resigning from the shadow cabinet with him in April 1972, going to Brussels as Britain's first Labour commissioner in 1973 and playing a key role in the referendum victory in 1975. </p> <p>His post-political life was a triumph. He graced numerous boards with bonhomie and wise judgment. After the IBA, he joined Roy Jenkins' team in the House of Lords as Lib Dem broadcasting and foreign affairs spokesman. </p> <p>George climbed high in the establishment, but never became a snob. He formed his view of people on the basis of their character, not their position. He lived modestly. His outward ease and sociability masked an inner reserve. He never lost his curiosity and engagement in the real world. The last real conversation I had with him was about the success of Gordon Brown's recent Labour conference speech and the prospects for the Glenrothes byelection. I shall miss the \"now, Roger, tell me what's going on with ... \" But it was beguilingly modest: he was so wise about politics, he had guessed already. </p> <p>George Morgan Thomson (Lord Thomson of Monifieth), politician and administrator, born January 16 1921; died October 3 2008</p>",
  "<p>It felt like a trick of the mind to remember that Aston Villa arrived here hoping to bring to an end Chelsea's extraordinary home record. Having seen his team outplayed from start to finish, it was tempting to wonder whether Martin O'Neill was offering the travelling fans an apology when he walked in their direction at the final whistle. The 90 minutes that had gone before might easily have demanded one, but it was Chelsea's majestic performance, rather than Villa's shortcomings, which occupied O'Neill's thoughts.</p> <p>\"I thought Chelsea were absolutely brilliant,\" said the Villa manager. \"We would have to have our best players playing at the top of their game to compete today, never mind anything else. It was a harsh lesson. It's where you want to be, what you want to aspire to, and I felt they were terrific. We didn't help ourselves, of course, but that doesn't matter. I think it's probably the best Chelsea have played. Some of the best sides in Europe might have been well beaten.\"</p> <p>Luiz Felipe Scolari, pictured, was equally impressed, the Chelsea manager saying his players' display had been the most rewarding since he took over in the summer. The only surprise was that Chelsea failed to turn in a more convincing victory. First-half goals from Joe Cole and Nicolas Anelka turned the final 45 minutes into little more than a procession, rather than the contest O'Neill had expected.</p> <p>\"I woke up this morning, thinking we would really win the game - so I am a bit daft - because we have been playing well and we came into the game at Stamford Bridge with plenty of confidence,\" said the Villa manager. \"Even when we went a goal behind I thought, 'If we can weather this, our good players will come to the fore'. But we weren't there and Chelsea were just brilliant. I thought they were magnificent and we genuinely could have learned a lot.\"</p> <p>Frank Lampard's performance was one which Villa's overrun midfield would do well to study, as painful as it might be to see the England international control and dictate proceedings with such consummate ease once again. With Fabio Capello watching from the stands, Lampard reaffirmed his best qualities on an afternoon when Ashley Young and Gareth Barry both failed to impress. \"I thought Lampard was absolutely outstanding,\" said O'Neill. \"He played very, very well,\" said Scolari.</p> <p>In truth there were many aspects for the Chelsea manager to cherish, including Ashley Cole's willingness to attack from full-back. Perhaps most satisfying for the Brazilian, however, was that this result was achieved with so many players in the treatment room. Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, Ricardo Carvalho, Deco and Alex were missing, yet their absence barely registered as Chelsea stretched their unbeaten league record at Stamford Bridge to 86 matches.</p> <p>\"I am satisfied because [the team] played very well,\" said Scolari. \"For me, it's the most important game in the season, because if we win we are in first position in the league and we have now a minimum of 10 days to recuperate our players. Some players will go to the national team but the other players who are injured have time to recuperate and, after 10 to 15 days, when we return to the league we will have all our players in good condition. This is most important for us.\"</p> <p>Scolari, who is confident that John Terry, who has a back complaint, will be fit for England duty at the weekend, pointed to Chelsea's position at the Premier League summit, their place at the top of their Champions League group and progress in the Carling Cup as reason to be content with their start to the season. \"But I want more,\" he added.</p> <p>There is no reason to believe he will be disappointed, according to O'Neill. \"He's a brilliant manager,\" said the Northern Irishman, who refused to accept that Villa's hopes of breaking into the top four are forlorn on this evidence. \"He's won the World Cup with a side whose expectations are incredibly high and that's hard to do, so he doesn't have to prove anything. He's enjoying himself. He's inherited a very good side and he's putting his own stamp on it, which is remarkable. I thought Chelsea were really brilliant, which is great credit to him and to the players.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you haven't seen <strong>Hole in the Wall</strong> (BBC1, Saturday) it goes like this. A celebrity in skin-tight silver Spandex stands by the edge of a pool. To the sound of a siren, a Styrofoam wall is revealed, with a shape cut out of it. The celebrity has a second to think about how to assume the shape of the hole before the wall comes towards them. If they pass through the wall successfully they get 10 points; if they end up in the pool, they score nothing. </p> <p>And that's it. It's a bit like those learning games babies have with shapes and holes, except these are grown-ups and they're using their bodies as the shapes.

Which she does, but then he turns out to be a baddie after all, and is killed, properly this time, but not so properly that he can't then be taken in for questioning by creepy conglomerate Massive Dynamic. </p> <p>There's something called The Pattern, too, but that's so secret I can't tell you what it is, otherwise all my own cells would crystallise. </p> <p>And The Observer, who has no eyebrows. Never trust a man with no eyebrows, my mum always told me, even if he's named after a reputable Sunday newspaper. </p> <p>I think what's going on is that science has got a bit out of control and is taking over.

  "<p>Within hours of the $700bn bail-out of Wall Street's financial giants clearing Congress on Friday, attention had shifted towards other stressed parts of the US economy.</p> <p>The focus is now on the country's jobs market after the Bush administration reported 150,000 job losses in September, the biggest monthly drop in five years which, if sustained, would see the US lose a million jobs this year.</p> <p>Though the political crisis in Washington was overcome with the second attempt at the bail-out bill being voted through by 263 to 171 votes in the House of Representatives, concern mounted quickly over the inability of the deal to cope with the wider economic weakness. In an editorial yesterday, the New York Times called on the government to move swiftly to protect Americans threatened with foreclosure and to pass a stimulus bill. \"The meltdown on Wall Street is only part of a larger meltdown and the bail-out bill is only one attempt at a fix,\" the paper said. </p> <p>\"The wheels seem to be coming off the economy right now,\" Brian Sack, a forecaster with Macroeconomic Advisers, told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's hard to see how we avoid a recession, and it could prove a tough one to climb out of.\" Under the broad terms of the bail-out, the treasury will have up to $700bn, released in stages, to buy up toxic mortgages and other assets in order to inject confidence into the financial system.</p> <p>Golden parachutes for executives seeking to profit from the collapse of their institutions will be forbidden, and the government is required to come up with a plan to ease the burden for threatened homeowners by adjusting the terms of those loans taken up by the treasury. George Bush, who has frequently tried to reassure the American public over the airwaves during the past fortnight, used his regular weekly radio broadcast to emphasise that the bail-out would bolster the general economy.</p> <p>But he said its impact would take time to filter through. \"My administration will move as quickly as possible, but the benefits of this package will not all be felt immediately,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The federal government will undertake this rescue plan at a careful and deliberate pace to ensure that your tax dollars are spent wisely.\"</p> <p>Ted Strickland, governor of Ohio, gave the official Democratic response, saying that the job losses, which now total 760,000 so far this year, were a sign that while the spotlight was on the big financial houses, ordinary Americans were suffering. \"The crisis that hit Wall Street a couple weeks ago isn't news to families on Main Street all across this country,\" he said.</p> <p>As the dust settles over the bail-out, some hard questions are likely to be asked about the amount of sweeteners added into the bill. </p> <p>With whips from both parties scrambling to bring representatives on board in advance of the vote on Friday, some $150bn of tax breaks were included in the final 400-page bill. </p> <p>The fine print of the legislation also included spending and tax breaks that were sought by individual members of Congress which they can now take back to their constituencies and use as arguments in favour of the deeply controversial measure.</p> <p>From today the first steps will be taken to implement the bail-out, starting with the employment of a small team of about 20 staff to implement the programme. The first treasury auction is likely to take weeks to put together, and will probably concentrate on discrete areas such as subprime loans that fell within a particular financial quarter.</p> <p>Some British banks with substantial American assets, such as Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, are likely to be able to take part in the bail-out.</p>",
  "<p>Charlie Gere (Letters, September 1) argues correctly that \"there's no such thing as free speech - and a good thing too\", but then fails to understand where and why bounds on freedom of expression are drawn. In 1720, two journalists, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, writing under the nom de plume Cato, laid down the essence of the principle: \"Freedom of speech ... is the right of everyman, as far as by it he does not hurt or control the right of another; and this is the only check which it ought to suffer, the only bounds it ought to know ... \" This does not include the notion that somebody can prohibit, or seek to prohibit, expression if they are merely offended, much less the idea that being offended gives one a right to \"hurt or control another\" by breaking the law to intimidate them.</p> <p>We have been very careful in our development of restrictions on this right. We have held since the 18th century that freedom requires, normally, publication and consequential damage has to be demonstrated. Beyond this we have restricted speech for a variety of reasons - state security, protection of identity of minors and so on. We also restrict speech differentially according to the medium of expression - broadcasting, for example, is more controlled than the press. There is, moreover, a dynamic here in that areas once protected - the Christian religion via the offence of blasphemy, say - are no longer protected so clearly as they once were. Obscenity in particular is subject to changing social standards. Publication of opinion, nevertheless, is not in any sense generally limited unless incitement to illegal acts can be proved - and that, as numerous court cases have shown, is still far from easy.</p> <p>When Gere asks if as a society we are happy to allow antisemitic publications, or those denying the Holocaust, encouraging race hate or paedophilia, the answer is that for the most part, however unhappy we are, we do allow such publication. It takes a specific law to restrict a specific type of speech; and recent new law doing this worries many as being itself a dangerous threat to our freedom. The right of free expression has its downside, but the wholesale and ill-defined limitations Gere seems to argue for are far worse. Confusions such as those he exhibits are the source of the mistaken idea in some quarters that illegal behaviour is justified by the fact that someone is offended; or is justified because the west is hypocritical and inconsistent in these matters.</p> <p>I am deeply offended by Gere's argument, which I find ill-informed and pretty dangerous. Rather than write this letter, were it not a clear threat to public order, I would be setting out right now to firebomb his office at the University of Lancaster to help him clear his mind.<br><strong>Prof Brian Winston</strong><br>University of Lincoln</p>",
  "<h2>Vouchers fail asylum seekers, says charity</h2> <p>Thousands of asylum seekers are being forced to live without cash under a voucher system that leaves many struggling to buy enough food and basic essentials, according to Britain's largest refugee charity. Around 9,000 people whose claims have failed and who have agreed to leave but are currently unable to do so, or who are launching fresh claims, are given accommodation and \u00a335 a week in tokens which must be spent at certain supermarkets. The Refugee Council found some people had lived on vouchers for years.

  "<p>When Alex Day started keeping a video diary on YouTube, he wasn't sure how it would turn out. The teenager, from Hornchurch in Essex, admits that he was just looking for some frank feedback on his funny stories and songs.</p> <p>\"I was making a video podcast to entertain family and friends - just a little comedy series,\" he said. Eighteen months on, 19-year-old Day, known by his nickname Nerimon, boasts more than 30,000 subscribers and is one of Britain's most popular YouTubers. </p> <p>Armed with cheap video cameras and the internet, a generation of youngsters are growing up very publicly with online videos - and being failed by adults who are not paying proper attention to this new medium.</p> <p>That claim is made in a research paper published today by the thinktank Demos. The study, Video Republic, examines the rise of the YouTube generation and considers how their enthusiasm and skills can be encouraged.</p> <p>\"It's now as normal for teenagers to write a blog as it is to write a diary - that's a massive shift,\" said Celia Hannon, a researcher with Demos and the lead author of the report.</p> <p>\"Youngsters are working out their relationship to the outside world and forging an identity.\"</p> <p>The report makes recommendations to help adults cope with the changing online environment, and calls particularly on schools to help youngsters understand the long-term implications of living their lives in a semi-public way. </p> <p>\"Schools, universities and businesses should prepare young people for an era where CVs may well be obsolete, enabling them to manage their online reputation,\" says the report. \"This generation of young people are guineapigs ... we need an educational response that extends beyond the focus of safety, towards broader questions of privacy and intellectual property.\"</p> <p>It also suggests that creating video blogs and online diaries should be part of the school curriculum, used by schools in the same way that they organise museum trips or extra art classes.</p> <p>Statistics show that the influence of online video is growing. Ten hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute of the day, and not all of it is karate-kicking chimps and dogs on skateboards. Figures from earlier this year suggest Britons are watching more than 3.6bn videos online each month - a rise of 56% from last year. YouTube, which is owned by internet giant Google, dominates the market with 20 million viewers in Britain, while the BBC trails a distant second with fewer than 6.5 million online viewers.</p> <p>Mainstream broadcasters are recognising the shift in consumption: the American cable broadcaster HBO recently launched a new show, Hooking Up, featuring a swath of popular YouTube stars. Although many web surfers have scoffed at what they see as a cynical attempt to cash in, the move exemplifies how the adult world is trying to reach out to video-friendly youth.</p> <p>The report also says that politicians can use online video as a way to engage with youngsters, who can sometimes be seen as apathetic and unreachable. But Hannon said such a strategy would only succeed if they were prepared to approach the internet on its own terms.</p> <p>\"The government is pouring vast amounts of money into this, because they feel young people should be making themselves heard,\" she said. \"But people can see through it - bloggers say it feels contrived.\" </p> <p>Instead, she offered the example of the US presidential candidate Barack Obama, who has seen intense interest from young voters after he encouraged them to exercise their creative urges online, instead of simply dictating his ideas to them. \"Obama is the first 'YouTube politician' because he gets that you can't control it. His campaign team get that it's about the enthusiasm.\"</p> <p>For Alex Day, there are no plans to give up any time soon. \"Thirty thousand, one hundred people watch me now and it'd be very unfair of me to suddenly stop and say 'just go watch someone else',\" he said. \"It's a lot of people so I'll always feel a commitment to putting out things they'll enjoy, in some form or another.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two monsters of the right fused into a double-headed ogre last week, when David Cameron decried the \"whole health and safety, human rights act culture\" to the Conservative conference. The main connection between workplace regulation and universal legal protections is that both are maligned and misunderstood. But Mr Cameron's soundbite pleased the floor and, in an otherwise sober speech, he might have been forgiven his populist one-liner.</p> <p>What made the words sinister, however, is the dangerous Tory policy on the Human Rights Act (HRA). The act codifies the European convention on human rights, which - it bears repeating - was drafted by British-led jurists in response to the totalitarian horrors of the second world war. Mr Cameron cites fictional rights to pornography in jail, but the truth is the HRA is a hard-headed document with public safety at its core. It protects the individual against overbearing government. That should fit well with Conservative scepticism of the state. Yet the party is pledged to repeal it in favour of a half-baked British bill of rights.</p> <p>Legally literate Tories, including the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, previously signalled that this bill would include all current protections. Last week, however, the Conservative welfare spokesman, Chris Grayling, said they would tear up the HRA and start again. Mr Cameron seems to agree, demanding weaker protection against torture: he wants greater freedom to deport terror suspects to countries where it is a risk. True, he also talks of granting new rights, such as a right to jury trial, but why do that on the back of repealing a law enshrining internationally agreed human rights? No country has done that before, so it would set a terrible precedent. </p> <p>Starting with a blank sheet on rights is not only undesirable, but also impossible - without leaving Europe. Respecting the European convention is a precondition for belonging to the Council of Europe, membership of which is compulsory for EU members. For all his reluctance to identify with his Christian Democratic counterparts, Mr Cameron wants to stay in the EU, and so would stick with the convention. If the British bill dropped any convention rights, Strasbourg could thus still enforce them. Mr Cameron limply suggests that in response to his bill Strasbourg might grant the UK a \"wider margin of appreciation\". This expectation flies in the face of serious opinion.</p> <p>The Conservatives are not alone in making the HRA a whipping boy. Tony Blair introduced it, but used to do the same. Today, though, ministers no longer pretend they can somehow rewrite the act. The Conservatives should now show the same maturity and pledge to respect human rights.</p>",
  "<p>It's not often that one is gifted with the opportunity to describe Warren Beatty as \"prescient\", but such is the reassuring silver lining to an otherwise pretty dark cultural phenomenon. Back in 1991 Beatty made a reluctant cameo in Madonna's auto-documentary, In Bed With Madonna. When a doctor suggests to the singer that they chat off camera, Beatty, a surly background presence, sneers out from his armchair: \"She doesn't want to live off camera, much less talk. There's nothing to say off camera. Why would you say something if it's off camera? What point is there in existing?\"</p> <p>It is apt that London's Hayward gallery is about to do an Andy Warhol retrospective, because his prediction that we'd all be famous for 15 minutes never looked more true than today. </p> <p>But in the past few months we have reached an interesting nadir with the unholy trinity of Katie Price, Kerry Katona and, most of all, Jade Goody, three women who represent better than any other the state of celebrity culture today. </p> <p>On just one day the other week, you could have read an interview with Price about how her latest breast surgery left her in need of severe diuretics, Katona's weekly column about her thuggish husband's recent antics, and plenty of interviews with Goody about telling children about cancer (through the front page of the Daily Mirror, apparently).</p> <p>Goody is a woman who could have come out of a particularly heavyhanded and moralistic Ben Elton novel: she first achieved national fame on a reality TV show (Big Brother); she was then shamed on another (Celebrity Big Brother, when she was accused of racism); she tried to find redemption on yet another (Indian Big Brother), only to be told, on air, that she had cancer (there is something quasi-religious in this sin and punishment mentality of reality TV); and she has now come back to England, where she can give daily updates on the progress of her cancer to the gawping tabloids. </p> <p>Obviously I very much hope for her sake that she gets better, but I think we can be sure that if the worst happens, there will be a TV camera in the room. It is like a parody of The Truman Show, but at least Truman broke out when he finally saw the false boundaries of his life. He didn't give interviews on GMTV about his upcoming hysterectomy.</p> <p>These three women are very different from Amy Winehouse, Britney Spears and other paparazzi car crashes, if only because they don't have the protection or the talent. Spears may get photographed by a wily paparazzo shaving off her hair, but she certainly wouldn't be allowed to give an interview about it. Just last month one celebrity magazine ran a laughably sycophantic interview with Spears, in which the hardest hitting question was something like: \"How do you, gorgeous Britney, combine being a super-talented singer with the demands of motherhood?\" - glossing over the fact that she actually doesn't have custody of her children due to drugs problems and hospital incarcerations. </p> <p>A week later, Price was in a similar magazine discussing her prolapsed womb and how her most recent plastic surgery left her with a paralysed arm and a fortnight of severe constipation. Speaking from experience in some of their cases, when you interview these three there are no warnings about anything being off limits because nothing is. When this results in Katona gabbling about taking cocaine when pregnant, it's not so easy to know if this is admirably honest or a non-sexualised form of prostitution, because what is prostitution but selling yourself beyond the point of self-protection or dignity? </p> <p>They are part of a generation that will swap wives, have their faeces inspected by a nutritionist and use lie detector tests to ascertain their partner's fidelity. Anything, in short, to get on TV. Price's insistent distinction between her Page 3 character, Jordan, and her true self, Katie Price, now looks pretty nebulous, particularly since she calls herself Katie on the reality TV series, Katie &amp; Peter, about her married life with Peter Andre - whom she met, of course, on a reality TV show.</p> <p>\"Super talented\" or not, Spears is a singer. But if you become famous for nothing, and have been led to believe that fame is the only important achievement, all you have to sell is yourself and your cancer. <br><a href=\"mailto:hadley.freeman@theguardian.com\"><br>hadley.freeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Gloucester have not filled Kingsholm this season, but with Premiership gates averaging close to 13,000 it is still surprising to find any stadium less than half full when Wasps and Gloucester go head-to-head.</p> <p>Dean Ryan, Gloucester's head coach, called the EDF Energy Cup \"a slow burner\", but it seemed more likely that even in this rugby-mad city, the fans took one look at the sides selected and decided to save their money for the Heineken Cup. Gloucester rested more than half their first-choice team ahead of their meeting with Biarritz; Wasps left out more and even a promised appearance of Danny Cipriani from the bench failed to materialise. Those who did turn up did not know that when they all paid at the gate.</p> <p>Ian McGeechan, Wasps' director of rugby, said the fly-half would play against Castres on Sunday. Later he said there were \"no issues\" surrounding the 20-year-old's early return - against Bath last week - from injury, even if the ankle he damaged so badly in May was understandably sore. </p> <p>\"It's a three-day recovery and it was just too quick, which is why we decided not to have him on the bench,\" said McGeechan. \"There is no problem, he's fit. It was just the timescale was too quick. There is certainly no problem.\"</p> <p>Cipriani, speaking to the BBC's Inside Sport programme, which will be screened tonight, said: \"I need to think about getting back playing for Wasps; I can't think about England at the minute. I need to think about playing for Wasps and playing well. I've only just come back from injury so I need to get a few games under my belt and play well for the club.\" </p> <p>As it was, Cipriani watched this game from home and on a miserable day, with the Cotswolds hidden by driving rain, he probably got the best of the deal as Wasps lost their fifth game from six this season.</p> <p>Lachlan Mitchell made an assured debut at full-back and Serge Betsen will be useful to have around when the back row is denuded by England call-ups. However, Gloucester had more reasons to be cheerful as two key men showed suggestions of timely returns to form.</p> <p>Ryan Lamb has started only twice this season and Lesley Vainikolo has also looked peripheral. According to his head coach, the Tongan wing has been ill at ease with a raft of new laws so soon after moving from rugby league. On Saturday Vainikolo was formidable, mixing rampaging runs with clever skills. He made Willie Walker's try by drawing half the Wasps cover before delivering a perfect inside pass and he also scored himself, fielding a cross-kick from Lamb, who played with assurance.</p> <p>With Alasdair Dickinson showing a turn of foot unknown to most 17-stone props, it just about justified the price of a ticket. </p> <p><strong>Gloucester</strong> Walker; Foster, Adams, Tindall (capt), Vainikolo; Lamb, R Lawson; Dickinson, Azam (S Lawson, 50), Young; Bortolami (Eustace, 48), Brown, Satala (Buxton, 54), Strokosch, Hazell.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Vainikolo, Walker. <strong>Con</strong> Walker. <strong>Pens</strong> Walker 3 </p> <p><strong>Drop-goal </strong>Lamb.</p> <p><strong>London Wasps</strong> Mitchell; Odejobi, Waldouck, Hoadley (Walder, 56), Voyce; Staunton, Robinson (Reddan, 48); French (Beech, 74), Webber, Holdford, Shaw, Birkett, Haskell, Worsley (capt), Betsen (Leo, 64).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Robinson, Haskell. <strong>Pens</strong> Staunton 2, Walder.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> M Fox (Leicestershire). <strong>Attendance</strong> 7,887. <br><strong><br>Heineken Cup one to watch:</strong> Lesley Vainikolo (Gloucester)</p> <p>Cut adrift by Martin Johnson and England, Gloucester's enormous former rugby league wing has adapted to the experimental law variations and rediscovered enough of his handling and kicking skills to be Biarritz's worst nightmare on Saturday</p>",

The court has hardened along ideological lines, deciding many high-profile cases by a 5-4 vote.</p> <p>Between now and June, the court will decide as many as 90 cases. Among the issues the court will decide: Whether a woman fired after cooperating with an internal sexual harassment investigation may sue the company for damages; whether federal communications regulators may punish a television network for broadcasting a \"fleeting expletive\"; and whether a state may prohibit local governments from automatically deducting voluntary union dues from their payrolls.</p> <p>The court is not scheduled to consider abortion rights cases this term, although abortion foes are set to pounce on any opportunity to revisit the landmark Roe v Wade decision of 1973 that barred the states from prohibiting the procedure.</p> <p>McCain has pledged to name justices in the mould of the court's most conservative jurists, who Kathryn Kolbert, president of the liberal political organisation People for the American Way, said would likely vote to overturn abortion rights protections, weaken the separation of church and state, restrict citizens' access to the court system, and rule against equal rights for gays and lesbians.</p> <p>\"The outcome of the election will determine the makeup of the court for the next 40 years,\" Kolbert said. \"We've seen 20 years of the right pushing for judges and justices on the Supreme Court who have a political agenda and have brought that political agenda to the court, and it's taken an extreme toll on Americans.\"</p> <p>The current court overturned Washington's handgun ban, allowed the state of Indiana to require voters to present a photo ID before casting a ballot, and cast other decisions that dismayed liberals.</p> <p>Conservatives fear that Obama would appoint jurists who will encroach too deeply on legislatures' authority to make law and will extend constitutional rights that conservatives contend do not exist in the nation's founding document.</p> <p>Among the most perilous cases are those in which the Supreme Court reins in the president's hand in prosecuting suspected terrorists, said Ed Whelan, former law clerk to conservative justice Antonin Scalia and a scholar at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Centre. </p> <p>In June, for instance, the court ruled that terrorism suspects held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, may challenge their detention in court, rejecting Bush White House arguments they were afforded no such right. </p> <p>McCain said at the time, \"the United States Supreme Court made a very bad decision when they decided to give these people the rights that American citizens have\".</p> <p>If Obama is elected, \"We see prospect on a range of issues that the court could march further to left,\" Whelan said, \"whether it's inventing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, stripping 'under God' out of the pledge of allegiance and judicial micro-managing of national security.\"</p> <p>It is unclear, however, to what extent voters are moved by concern for the ideological leanings of future Supreme Court nominees. Not very much, said Tom Goldstein, who teaches Supreme Court litigation at Harvard and Stanford universities and who has argued 18 cases before the high court.</p> <p>\"The Supreme Court is a very important electoral issue,\" he said, \"but ironically not one that will change any votes\".</p>",

  "<p>The EU's ambitious plans to mount a collective response to the global financial crisis were in tatters tonight after the German government said it would guarantee all private savings in a move to prevent panic withdrawals - just a day after slamming the Irish for doing the same.</p> <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin: \"We're saying to savers that their deposits are secure.\" Peet Steinbrueck, finance minister, added: \"I'd like to stress that we'll make sure that no German saver should fear losing a euro of their deposits.\"</p> <p>Their comments came just hours after it emerged that the EU is forcing Ireland to substantially change its plans to offer all savers and businesses an unlimited guarantee on their bank deposits.</p> <p>Neelie Kroes, EU competition commissioner, said the Irish scheme, adopted without consulting either Brussels or other European governments, was discriminatory and would be modified. \"A guarantee without limits is not allowed,\" she told Dutch TV.</p> <p>The EU's top four leaders, including Merkel, had slapped down Dublin's go-it-alone approach at an emergency summit yesterday after the European commission had earlier forced Greece to row back on a similar plan to provide limitless guarantees for bank deposits.</p> <p>The EC will soon propose new laws to lift the EU-wide minimum guarantee from the current \u20ac20,000 and ensure speedier payout if banks become insolvent. But Merkel is jumping ahead, pledging that the German scheme - which relies on high street banks to pay out above the minimum - will now be wholly state-guaranteed.</p> <p>Merkel also promised today that the German government was working hard to save the troubled Hypo Real Estate bank, Germany's second biggest commercial property lender. A multi-billion euro rescue plan to keep the real-estate giant afloat failed last night and efforts were continuing to try to create a new plan. \"We will not allow the distress of one financial institution to distress the entire system,\" Merkel told reporters. \"For that reason, we are working hard to secure Hypo Real Estate.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Gordon Brown, Merkel, Italy's Silvio Berlusconi and host Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, called for a new global financial system and an end to \"speculative\" capitalism, while Peter Mandelson, incoming business secretary, warned the crisis could spark a new wave of economic nationalism.</p> <p>Mandelson, EU trade commissioner for the past four years and a severe critic of the Irish and Greek schemes, said the danger was that each country could undermine a collective response by looking for a \"get out of jail free\" card.</p> <p>Yesterday, clearly aware that they could be facing the worst economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s, the four leaders back Sarkozy's call for a global summit to draw up a new international financial system to replace the one adopted by the West at Bretton Woods in 1944. It established the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p> <p>The French president urged a summit of the G8 countries together with China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia by next month at the latest.</p> <p>\"We are laying the foundations of entrepreneurial capitalism, not speculative capitalism,\" Sarkozy told journalists. \"After this crisis we will have built the pillars of a new financial world.\" He said tougher international regulation should be applied to all financial market players, including hedge funds.</p> <p>The summit effectively buried temporarily the strict 3% budget deficit limit imposed by the Maastricht treaty as EU governments are forced to bail out stricken banks with hundreds of billions of euros, putting huge strains on their budgets.</p> <p>Sarkozy's top advisor, Claude Gu\u00e9ant, said that did not mean that EU countries such as France would \"wriggle out\" of commitments towards a balanced budget by 2012. \"We are in exceptional circumstances but that does not mean France will let its deficit run away,\" he told French radio, adding that an even deeper crisis would prompt other measures.</p> <p>In Britain, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, said today that he was ready to offer further assistance to individual banks at risk from the credit crunch. He declined to name any banks that may be under threat but said the Treasury was monitoring the situation; he said it was important to take general action as well as assisting individual banks. </p> <p>\"That's why, through the Bank of England, we have put billions of pounds into the system to help the whole banking sector, he told BBC1's Andrew Marr show. \"But also you do need to be ready to take specific action - as we did with Bradford &amp; Bingley last weekend, as we did with Northern Rock.\"<br> The UK's chancellor said the government was prepared to take \"pretty big steps that we wouldn't take in ordinary times\" to ensure that Britain gets through the current crisis.</p> <p>But he said he would resist pressure to scrap the Bank of England's target of keeping inflation within a percentage point of 2%, which has been criticised for obstructing potential reductions in interest rates that could stave off a recession.</p> <p>He also indicated that he was ready to let state borrowing rise higher rather than increase taxes.</p> <p>Darling said it was \"always important\" to keep inflation under control and that the government would \"allow borrowing to rise as the economy slows down. That is the right thing to do - you support it, you don't start taking money out of it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Financial excess is an old theme of literature. Shakespeare dealt with it in The Merchant of Venice, and it evencrops up in The Canterbury Tales. Trollope's The Way We Live Now, featuring the fraudulent financier Augustus Melmotte, is perhaps the most famous 19th-century dissection of corruption and greed, while the capitalist frenzy that gripped early 20th-century America was chronicled by, among others, Upton Sinclair and Theodore Dreiser. More recently, Eighties excess was immortalised in several big, testosterone-fuelled novels, most notably Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, Jay McInnerny's Brightness Falls and Martin Amis's Money.</p> <p>It seems odd, then, that the financial haymaking that has been going on in recent times has largely escaped the attention of writers. The wealth accumulation of the past few years has been considerably more spectacular than that of any previous era, yet the 21st-century Masters of the Universe have remained stubbornly absent from fiction. There have been no memorable portrayals of oligarchs or hedge fund managers, no bracing satires set in the world of private equity. That other big topic of our age, the War on Terror, has had its share of chroniclers, but the misdeeds of financiers have \u2013 so far \u2013 been overlooked.</p> <p>This absence is not confined to novels. The last famous film about banking was Wall Street, with Michael Douglas playing Gordon ('Greed is good') Gecko \u2013 and that was in 1987. Television drama has taken us behind the scenes of professions from lawyers and doctors to teachers and politicos, but there has been no This Life for bankers, no ER of the hedge fund world. Theatre has become much more politically engaged, taking on all manner of high level corruption and malfeasance, but though it has exposed the rottenness o Westminster, it has not dealt with the rottenness of the Square Mile.</p> <p>What accounts for this? The most obvious answer is that modern finance is so mind-bogglingly complex that few writers feel equipped to tackle it. What lawyers and doctors get up to is broadly known and has a basic drama we can all relate to. (Will the criminal be convicted? Will the patient live?) But few of us can understand, let alone sympathise with, the issues that cause bankers to break out in sweats. The drama surrounding a fine adjustment in the value of a derivative, or a 10-point fall in the Dow Jones, is not something that can be easily captured on the page.</p> <p>Yet although the minutiae of bankers' working lives have become unapproachably obscure, what they get up to in their leisure time should be, from a novelist's point of view, entirely accessible The lives of the super-rich are not sealed off from view; they are part of the spectacle of our times, the cultural fabric of life in the early 21st century. We know about the \u00a330,000 lunches at Mayfair restaurants, the millions spent on Warhols and Hirsts at auction. We know about the private jets, the villas, the trips to Spearmint Rhino. People are immensely curious about these things, as is demonstrated by the success of banking memoirs, from Liar's Poker to City Boy. If nothing else, it shows a depressing lack of commercial enterprise on the part of our novelists that so few of them have attempted to capitalise on this interest.</p> <p>No doubt part of the problem is that, in Britain, there is a long-standing aversion to writing about business. More than a century ago, Henry James decreed that novels should focus on private life and the emotions, not politics and business; most writers since have taken him at his word. With a few honourable exceptions, such as David Lodge in Nice Work and Julian Barnes in England, England, contemporary British writers have steered clear of business. This is not a problem that has afflicted their American counterparts.</p> <p>Perhaps because US writers are generally more ambitious, and also because US culture is less sniffy about moneymaking, modern American novelists seem at home in the worlds of work and money in a way that few British onesdo. Think of Saul Bellow's comi-tragic portrait of errant market speculation in Seize the Day, or Philip Roth's account of factory life in American Pastoral. Or think of David Foster Wallace's sinister vision of a corporatised America of the future in his 1996 epic Infinite Jest.</p> <p>We should not be surprised, then, that it is an American writer who has been most prescient about the current financial upheavals. In his slim 2003 novel Cosmopolis, Don DeLillo tracked the life of an enormously wealthy currency trader on a day of global financial meltdown. It is by no means DeLillo's best work, but many things about it that now seem prophetic \u2013 the way, for instance, he captures the trader's overweening ambition and arrogance, and how he evokes the sense of a system that no one fully understands spinning rapidly out of control. These are hugely rich themes for a novelist \u2013 think of what Kafka, or even Dickens, would have done with them \u2013 and they are certainly deserving of further literary outings. Perhaps one of the many bankers now with time on their hands will manage to do them justice.</p> <p>\u2022 William Skidelsky is books editor of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>At an <a href=\"http://www.lecturelist.org/content/view_lecture/5742\">Economist debate</a> last week on political cartooning, and how \"the art of satire shapes the political landscape\", it dawned on me that satirists face a monumental problem today. So deep-rooted is our disdain for politicians that the satirists who mock them \u2013 depicting them as dumb monkeys or with their underpants pulled up over their trousers \u2013 are really only massaging our prejudices, stroking our cynicism, rather than challenging us to think about the world differently. Alexander Pope said satirists should \"without sneering teach the rest to sneer\". Today, in our era of sneering, satire risks becoming a self-congratulatory, back-patting display of shared public cynicism.</p> <p>There was some pretty good satire on display during the debate. The speakers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.kaltoons.com/\">Kevin \"KAL\" Kallaugher</a>, who has been the Economist's political cartoonist for 30 years, and Henry Naylor, creator of ITV's animated satire series <a href=\"http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=6299983222\">Talking Heads</a> \u2013 showed some decent stuff. I particularly liked Naylor's skit on Gordon Brown, depicted as a dour and Dickensian bookkeeping figure, trying to organise a celebrity party at No 10, only to be gatecrashed by Amy Winehouse and Pete Doherty who tattooed the word \"knob\" on his forehead. Yet this induced a curious noise in the audience: a kind of knowing laughter, more of a murmur of agreement than a startled guffaw. The best satire once made us rethink things, or at least made us gasp; now it makes us think: \"Yeah you're right, they're all twats.\"<br> So much political comedy these days upholds the cynical and even mainstream view rather than challenging it. It will be a nippy day in hell before anyone is surprised by something Rory Bremner says. His routine (\"routine\" being the operative word) reads like a list of the petty prejudices passed around the dinner party circuit of London N1. Used to love Tony Blair but now hates him: check. Thinks there should be a legal inquiry into Iraq: check. Reckons all politicians are liars and connivers: check. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre/reviews/little-britain-live-guildhall-portsmouth-512469.html\">David Walliams' explanation</a> for why he depicts so many grotesque people in Little Britain \u2013 incontinent old women, thick ugly chavs, etc \u2013 could have come straight from an internal Islington council memo: \"We don't stereotype. We celebrate difference.\"</p> <p>Marcus Brigstocke does stand-up routines on how global warming sceptics are evil and deluded, which, seriously, at a time when sceptics are publicly branded as \"deniers\" and serious commentators say they should be denied air-time, is about as fresh or challenging as making a joke about Thatch. What next, a comedy routine on how awful paedophiles are? As <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/radio/2008/06/marcus-brigstocke-quirke-funny\">Antonia Quirke said recently in the New Statesman</a>, Brigstocke, like so many other political comics and satirists of our time, \"just assumes the audience will be complicit in the utterly bog-standard, unsurprising bit of wafty liberal observation that is coming out of his mouth\".<br> Brigstocke also shows how prejudicial this cheap, self-congratulatory \"political comedy\" can be. Again massaging the prejudices of liberal England, he does a stand-up routine on how untrustworthy and generally fecal working-class builders are. They overcharge you, never smile, drink \"eight gallons of tea every five minutes\" and leave \"a turd in your loo so big that the only way you can flush it down is by breaking it up with a fucking stick\", he says. Mocking the lower classes while an audience of middle-class Radio 4 listeners laughs heartily along? Brigstocke truly is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jun/19/surplusmanning\">Bernard Manning</a> of the liberal set.<br> Sometimes today, political comedy and satire are so drippingly cynical that they end up spreading backward ideas rather than enlightening us. Private Eye is still home to some of Britain's most cutting satire, yet it also shows what can happen when healthy scepticism becomes relentless cynicism. For years, Private Eye published bizarre article after bizarre article on the alleged harms of the MMR vaccine, presumably because it thinks that if the government says something is safe, then it mustn't be. Politicians say black; we say white. From \"bravely\" attacking global warming deniers to mocking/celebrating the lower classes to spreading irrational fears about medicine \u2026 our political comics have become the mouthpieces for an utterly non-progressive political cynicism. Even worse, sometimes they're just not funny.</p> <p>Of course, there are still good satirists out there. Chris Morris, perhaps recognising that parliamentary politics is now beyond satire, has turned to satirising the increasingly pompous media or the politics of fear. Online magazines like The Onion and the Daily Mash hit a nerve. Yet there are still vast swathes of mainstream authority that our \"brave\" satirists leave untouched \u2013 environmentalism, for example. The green outlook, with its censorious, misanthropic streak and its fabulously hypocritical adherents, is ripe for the bullet of satire. So where is it? In an attempt to ignite it (warning: shameless plug ahead) my new satire on environmentalism is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton this month. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-some-hints-for-saving-the-world-935308.html\">The Independent says it is \"richly comic\"</a>.

  "<p>The curse of Roanoke has once again struck. During the primaries visits by both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were cancelled after a freak storm shut the town down. On Saturday came news that vice presidential candidate Joe Biden <a href=\" http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/179361\">will not</a> in fact come to Roanoke on Monday. He has to cancel because his mother-in-law is in a critical condition.</p> <p>Yesterday morning there were long queues at the Obama campaign office waiting for tickets which had sold out by 11am. Indiana senator, Evan Bayh, will take his place. \"Nobody here really knows who he is,\" a local volunteer told me. But few probably knew who Biden was either before he was picked as the vice-presidential candidate. So maybe nobody will notice.</p>",
  "<p>There was no ill-fitting glove, no dream team, no slow-motion car chase, and no plaintive wail of a dog. But there was OJ. In his Las Vegas trial on a series of 12 charges including kidnap and burglary, Orenthal James Simpson did his best to reprise his role in his most famous appearance, the 1995 \"trial of the century\".</p> <p>But this time, no one was watching. OJ's celebrated arrival at the Regional Justice Center each morning showed the defendant to be, in the words of one commentator, a \"silent walker\". The crash barriers were in place, Lewis Avenue was shut down, but nobody turned up, barring a few eccentrics hawking, appropriately enough, OJ memorabilia.</p> <p>\"Nobody seems to care anymore,\" observed the mildly panicked cable news presenter as lawyers presented closing arguments in the case. Court information officer Michael Sommermeyer had a sober explanation: \"A lot of other things are going on around the country and we're not getting as much attention as we expected.\"</p> <p>The explanation for the lack of interest lies partly with the case itself. In his opening remarks, Yale Galanter, Simpson's attorney, described his client's accusers, not unjustly, as \"a cast of very nefarious characters\".</p> <p>Certainly the procession of prosecution witnesses and the evidence provided by grainy surveillance tapes and garbled audio recordings suggested something less than sophisticated criminals executing the perfect crime.</p> <p>Instead, the caper that led to Simpson's trial might have been an outtake from a particularly unlikely episode of The Sopranos. Hotel security cameras captured the pack of middle-aged men waddling across the lobby of the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas. Dressed in a combination of Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts and baseball caps they waddled purposefully toward room 1203 and a meeting with two sports memorabilia sellers.</p> <p>The men were pumped up. \"I'm going to have to be my intimidating best,\" Simpson said, shortly before heading to the confrontation. Bring \"some heat\" \u2013 guns \u2013 one witness alleged that Simpson asked one of the gang.</p> <p>The wannabe wise guys continued the act in the hotel room and beyond, into the trial. The \"nefarious characters\", five of whom made plea deals and testified against their alleged ringleader and his co-defendant, did not play well on the stand. One sat leafing through a copy of the Bible \u2013 a celebrity trial tactic last deployed by Paris Hilton; others were taken ill or seemed to have undergone personality transplants since the alleged incident little over a year before.</p> <p>Few emerged with any credit during the trial: not the motley collection of sports memorabilia dealers and part-time felons who shopped their tales to celebrity websites and publishers, not the police officers who were heard to exclaim shortly after the incident was reported: \"This is great \u2026 California can't get him \u2026 Now we'll be able to.\"</p> <p>Even the judge in the case, journalist-turned-jurist Jackie Glass, exhibited bizarre behaviour, shouting at attorneys for raising objections, joshing with Arthur, the court security guard, about his weight. On the final day of testimony, in a voice quavering with emotion, she erupted: \"I'm surprised you haven't seen my head spin and fire come out of my mouth at this point in this trial.\" Simpson's attorney calmed her with the words: \"I can relate.\"</p> <p>If the OJ trial 2008 boasted a showboating judge, that was not the only echo of 1995, when Judge Lance Ito dominated the televised proceedings. Simpson's acquittal 13 years ago on charges that he murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, loomed over this trial. Indeed, the alleged crime took place in Las Vegas because Simpson was desperate to retrieve what he considered his property and stop it falling into the hands of the Goldman family, still looking to recoup some of the $33.5m damages awarded by a jury after Simpson was found liable for the deaths of Brown and Goldman in a civil case. Had he reclaimed the property in California, the Goldmans would have been able to claim it.</p> <p>But the chief reminder of the 1995 trial was the defendant. Older, greyer and more portly than 14 years ago, occasionally sporting a pair of glasses, OJ Simpson sat in court a shadow of his former self. Gone was the gloating figure of old, the sporting hero and action movie star who famously could not fit the glove on to his hand. And as in 1995, Simpson did not give his side of the story, sitting mute in court, with only facial expressions, huffs and the occasional shrug to express his feelings on finding himself once again tangling with the justice system.</p> <p>Some of the old charisma that made The Juice one of the most famous people in America still abides. But Simpson leads a troubled life. Many Americans think he got away with murder at his last criminal trial. Shunned, he is unable to work lest his money be seized by creditors. He spends his time playing golf in Florida, living on his $25,000 per month pension from his days as an American football star, income that is protected from seizure. He has been through a sequence of bizarre events since his acquittal on murder charges: he was found liable in the civil case, he was acquitted on charges of road rage, he tried out for a reality TV show, and he participated in a \"hypothetical confession\", the book If I Did It, published last year.</p> <p>Now Simpson faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison, an outcome that many see as harsh for the crimes of which he has been convicted \u2013 conspiracy, kidnapping, armed robbery \u2013 but just for the crime for which he was acquitted, double murder.</p> <p>Laurie Levenson, a professor at the Loyola law school in Los Angeles, said: \"This will be payback for a lot of people.\"</p> <p>The man who helped give us the term celebrity justice may finally have brought some closure to those who are still traumatised by the memory of a slick legal team and a smirking defendant celebrating his acquittal 13 years ago.</p>",

But through a combination of radio, shamelessly winging it, TV, shamelessly winging it, internet, shamelessly winging it, guesswork, shamelessly winging it a DeLorean and shamelessly winging it, we'll keep you in touch with all six. This said, I've never done a theguardian.com clockwatch before and, if my first attempts at certain other zesty human enterprises are anything to go by, I'll be apologising in five seconds' time. Sorry.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>It's an important day</strong> for Liverpool and Chelsea, because the ominous majesty of Manchester United's victory at Blackburn yesterday suggests that, after a bit of an after-you start to the title race, it's now well and truly on - and that, despite all the big-four clubs dropping points to sides in the bottom half of the table, it will still probably take 90 points to win the title. </p> <p>It's also a massive day for Manchester City, who may well find reality's incisors piercing the skin of their derriere for the fourth (domestic) game in five. You wouldn't it past them to make a complete dog's dinner of having billions and somehow find a way to get relegated, would you?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Anyway, here's a list of the games to come</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea v Aston Villa (3pm)</strong> Villa are going to win this. Get on them at 5/1, seriously. Ignore the fact that my <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">Pick The Score</a> predictions yesterday were Blackburn 1-1 Man Utd, Wigan 2-0 M'boro, West Brom 2-1 Fulham and Sunderland 1-2 Arsenal. Ignore all those distractions. I really do think Villa are the team most likely to end Chelsea's 747-match unbeaten home run, partly because of all Chelsea's injuries \u2013 which might mean them having to play such inadequates as Wayne Bridge (\u00a3plenty), Alex (\u00a3plenty), Nicolas Anelka (\u00a3plenty), Jon Obi Mikel (\u00a3plenty), Michael Ballack (\u00a3plenty) and Salomon Kalou (\u00a3plenty) \u2013 but mainly because Villa are the most intrepid side in the league, which is important when you are confronting Goliath, and because they always do well at Stamford Bridge. Something tells me Chelsea won't lose their record to a big-four side, that the stakes are always so high as to produce an almost perfect level of concentration; of the rest, Villa are by far the most likely.</p> <p>My prediction, which should safely ensure that this isn't the score: 1-2.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Joe F Kinnear's post-match press conference (6.01 pm), preceded by Everton v Newcastle</strong> As Andy Hunter wrote in this rag yesterday, \"the Samaritans may be of more use than stewards as two depressed clubs meet at Goodison Park\". There's no shame in losing to a splendidly vivacious Standard Liege side, as Everton did, but there is in losing all three home games in the league, as they have thus far. Still, surely they'll have enough to beat Shower FC today.</p> <p>My prediction, which etc: What are you, my personal secretary? F*** off.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Manchester City v Liverpool (3pm)</strong> Statistically it's the best attack in the league (City have scored 16) v the best defence (Liverpool have conceded 2). It's also, if Robinho and 50,000 Scousers are to be believed, the clash of two bona fide title contenders. Good one lads.</p> <p>My prediction, which etc: 0-1.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Portsmouth v Stoke City (3pm)</strong> Next!</p> <p>Prediction: 3-1.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Spurs v Hull (3pm)</strong> We'd have expected this to be 20th v 7th, oh aye, but not like this. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/14/tottenhamhotspur.premierleague\">What are Spurs trying to do to me and what remains of my professional reputation?</a> Hull, incidentally, have been wonderful - even Phil Brown's suit-flapping celebrations are strangely infectious - and, such is the importance of momentum from the first few weeks, should easily stay up now.</p> <p>Prediction: 2-1.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>West Ham v Bolton (1.30pm)</strong> West Ham are looking to make it three wins out of three in the league under Chelsea's Gianfranco Zola. Bolton are trying to avoid the completion of a dubious hat-trick: after losing goals through a dodgy offside decision (v Arsenal) and an even dodgier penalty (v Man Utd) in their last two games, expect one of their players to be sent off today for deliberate use of oxygen.</p> <p>Prediction: 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.56pm culling of team news from the wires</strong> Both dies are unchanged. Bolton look to be set out in the new missionary position, 4-5-1, but I'm not sure about West Ham as I've not seen them under Zola. Apparently they're doing it in some funky new ways, with talk of Etherington playing further forward. Ah, I'm told West Ham play 4-3-3, although this begs the question as to where 4-3-3 begins and 4-5-1 ends. When you play at home, I suppose, at least in terms of perception. But really it's 4-5-1 in all but name. 4-4-2 is dead; long live 4-5-1.</p> <p>If West Ham win, incidentally, they go temporarily top. Supersize that whoop whoop.</p> <p>West Ham, who let's be honest look pretty, pretty modest on paper without all those injured stars: Green; Faubert, Neill, Upson, Ilunga; Behrami, Parker, Noble; Di Michele, Etherington, Cole.<br>Subs: Lastuvka, Lopez, Bellamy, Boa Morte, Mullins, Davenport, Sears.</p> <p>Bolton, who let's be honest are in serious, serious danger of disappearing through the Do One door this season, especially now that Hull and West Brom are staying up: Jaaskelainen; Steinsson, Andrew O'Brien, Cahill, Samuel; Davies, Nolan, McCann, Muamba, Gardner; Elmander.<br>Subs: Habsi, Hunt, Taylor, Joey O'Brien, Smolarek, Riga, Shittu.</p> <p>Bloke who had his head flushed the toilet every day at school I mean how else are we to explain why anyone would want to become a referee: Mike Dean (Wirral)</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1pm</strong> Sky open up their coverage, in reference to Newcastle, with Coldplay's Trouble. A delightful song for sure - and never more moving than in the last episode of season 1 of The Shield - but surely there are better ones. Anything by Holy F*** maybe. Any nominations for Newcastle/<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/10/03/audio-hear-joe-kinnear-s-full-unbleeped-uncensored-rant-at-daily-mirror-man-simon-bird-115875-20770121/\">JFK</a>'s new anthem? Let's riff here kids!</p> <p>\"Do Chelsea fans still have that banner emblazoned with, 'Zola - Chelsea's Greatest Ever Player'?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"Because he is. And I know you're not supposed to have 'second teams' but right now, it's hard not to want West Ham to win every match except against Everton.\" It all depends on which force you regard as the more powerful: the considerable good of Zola v the bad of <em>everything else to do with that wretched little club with the possible exception of the admirable Mark Noble</em>. In no way influenced by the memories of 1992 and 1995, I'll go with the latter.</p> <p>Also, Zola wasn't as good as Andy Dow or Mark Stein. Fact. In all seriousness, I thought Zola was just a <em>fraction</em> overrated during his time at Chelsea, though this isn't to say he wasn't an utterly charming footballer and human being. And much as it pains me to say it - and truly it does, more than a malevolent marmot that only eats round things and has been let loose in my bath - I'd probably argue that Frank Lampard is Chelsea's greatest-ever player, or at least their most influential, which is arguably the same thing.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Anyone out there? Hello? Helloooooooo?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> Bolton kick off from left to right. It's been pooting it down in London, and the consequently slick surface should suit West Ham more than Bolton, who are still labouring under the misapprehension that there is grass in the sky. West Ham still have those ridiculously big numbers on the front of their shirts, which in no way highlight the fact that there's no longer a sponsor there and that they've lost loads of money as a result. Surely it would have been better just to keep quiet about it and hope nobody noticed? It's like having a toilet accident on a night out and then going round and telling everybody, 'See that wet patch down there? It's not water you know, or booze. Did it myself. Yep, all my own.' Sort of.</p> <p>It's actually not like that at all, is it.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.32pm</strong> Bolton have started well, pinning West Ham in their own half for the first couple of minutes, although they've shown all the wit of, well, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/10/03/audio-hear-joe-kinnear-s-full-unbleeped-uncensored-rant-at-daily-mirror-man-simon-bird-115875-20770121/\">Joe Kinnear</a> when it comes to trying to penetrate the defence.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.36pm</strong> Mark Noble is booked for a lunging tackle on Steinsson. From the free-kick, taken by Gardner, Cahill at the far post looks set to head in from six yards but is put off by Ilunga, flailing his arms everywhere like something out of those old iPod ads, and so misses his header completely. That was a real chance.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.38pm</strong> Bolton continue to impress, and actually they're popping it around a lot more than is often the case. After one move chockfull of first-time passes, Nolan drives approximately 12 miles wide of the left post from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.42pm</strong> Carlton Cole, who hilariously I've heard linked with England recently, rolls Andy O'Brien smartly 25 years out but then curls his shot over. A minute later Elmander has a real chance. Gardner slipped him in on the edge of the box but his first touch was a fraction too heavy and, with two defenders converging, he had to stretch to toebung it tamely it at Green from 15 yards. That's what you get for \u00a310m these days.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.44pm</strong> \"Zola over-rated?\" puddemups Gary Naylor. \"To see him live was an honour, even as he took Everton apart. Balance, pace, energy and, most of all, brains meant that he had absolutely everything. He also played in the hole, the most difficult position on the pitch. I would argue that he was as good as any Premier League player I've seen with the possible exceptions of Schmeichel and Cantona, because he played in a relatively weaker team than other pretenders like Keane or Shearer (Blackburn vintage).\" I did say only a fraction. I feel the memories of his first season prevailed even when he regressed to the mean. I don't think he ever got near that level again, which made him merely breathtakingly good rather than heartstoppingly good. I'd also argue that he was at his best when Chelsea were at their weakest: in 1996-97. From 1998-99 onwards Chelsea were, theoretically at least, title challengers.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> That Elmander miss summed up Bolton's problem: their play can be useful, and their work ethic is so admirable as to make it impossible for a minute-by-minute hack not to patronise them when referring to it, but they desperately miss a sniffer like Nicolas Anelka.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.49pm</strong> Bolton remain the more impressive side, both with and without the ball. West Ham are just a little ragged, and slightly too manic in their offensive work. They could do with a diminutive Italian to put his foot on the ball and calm things down.</p> <p>\"If West Ham paid Bordeax the \u00a310m for Elmander in Icelandic krona and in shares in the former (not-to-be-named) sponsor, it wouldn't be so bad, would it?\" says Lou Roper, every mention of whose name irritatingly precipitates a blast of that U2 song 'Numb' in my head, because of the album from which it came.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong> Decent effort from di Michele, who comes inside from the right and, from 25 yards, tries to coax one into the far corner with his left foot. It went a few yards wide and, in truth, Jaaskelainen had it covered.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> West Ham remain a bit too narrow, which is partly a consequence of di Michele's inclination to come inside at every opportunity. That suits an extremely narrow Bolton side, who have down their defensive work excellently so far.</p> <p>\"The <strong>BIG</strong> West Ham numbers on their shirt fronts look like they were sown on by their mums for the school sports day,\" says Gary Naylor. \"It's a bit boring just repeating what's on their backs - wouldn't it be more fun if the numbers corresponded to the player's weekly wage in thousands?\" Could be a different thing each week. The amount of groupies they've, a-hem, bought a 12% ABV drink for, say.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.57pm</strong> This, it's fair to say, is not the kind of contest about which Gianfranco Zola fantasises when he takes a long soak in the bath. Indeed some might say it's witless garbage. Still, there should be some excitement in the next few minutes: the team news from the other games will be in.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.58pm</strong> Behrami drives one a few yards wide from the edge of the box. This Ilunga fellow at left-back for West Ham looks a player: he makes some really hyperactive surges, like Kolo Toure when he's on one, and has been West Ham's greatest attacking threat so far. With the likes of him and wee Rafael, it's clear the role of the full-back is changing irrevocably.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.59pm: GOAL! West Ham 0-1 Bolton (Davies 30)</strong> Robert Green, England's No6, lives up to the billing with a shocker. Gardner drilled a long cross from the left and Green, who had come 15 yards to meet it, dropped the wet ball at the feet of Davies. He muscled Ilunga aside and lobbed the ball into the empty net. That really is a serious howler.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>2.04pm: GOAL! West Ham 0-2 Bolton (Cahill 34)</strong> Blimey, it's two. This one is a more familiar Bolton goal. A free-kick is coaxed gently into the box towards Davies, who doesn't win it but does enough to put the defender off. His header falls to Steinsson 15 yards out, who spanks it goalwards on the half-volley with his left foot. Green does well to save, plunging to his left, but Cahill bundles the rebound in for his first goal for Bolton.</p> <p>Edit: on reflection, Green should have held on to that as well as it was right in the breadbasket. The conditions won't have helped, but even the sixth-best goalkeeper in England should be saving that.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> Robert Green hasn't kept a clean sheet since February and, if you can't keep one at home to Bolton, you have to wonder if it's <em>ever going to happen ever ever ever</em>. But you have to give credit to Bolton, who have played pretty well in the first two-thirds of the pitch. They often to, but through both luck and judgement they've also delivered in the final third.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>2.08pm</strong> Ilunga has blood gushing from his left hand and is going down the tunnel to get it seen to. Someone send me an email. Please. No, really: please.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.12pm</strong> The thing about West Ham is that people have got a bit carried away with Zola's start. All they've done is hammer Shower FC and beat ten-man Fulham, while losing to Watford in the Milk Cup. They look a poor side on paper without Bellamy (who's on the bench today), Dyer, Ashton etc, and today they've looked equally poor on the pitch. Bolton are all over them here, and a wonderful cross from the impressive Steinsson curls right across the face of the six-yard box without getting a touch.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.13pm</strong> West Ham are making Bolton - <em>Bolton</em> - look like Brazil 82, or at very least Brazil 86. This is laughable, and I'm laughing.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: Half-time, West Ham 0-2 Bolton</strong> Dear me. West Ham played with the befuddlement of a man who turned up for a chess marathon and found out he was at an orgy. Or something. They were almost indescribably poor, and Bolton only needed to be on the good side of competent to take an almost unfathomable 2-0 lead through goals from Kevin Davies and Gary Cahill.</p> <p>\"Have to agree with you about that Rafael, he's a little smasher,\" says Sarah Lawton. \"Seen much of the brother though?\" Well probably, but I can't be sure as they are basically one and the same person. Maybe that's why he looked so funky when I said 'Well played Rafael'. Apparently he's basically the same player but at left-back. <em>Imagine</em>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.20pm: Tottenham team news aka what the hell happened to David Bentley's career?</strong> </p> <p>Tottenham (4-4-2): Gomes; Gunter, Corluka, Woodgate, Bale; Lennon, Jenas, Zokora, Modric; Pavlyuchenko, Campbell.

Kevin Davies is a much better player than Serginho.\" Socrates v Kevin Nolan is a no-brainer as well.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.26pm: Man City team news, aka I need the little boy's room so will leave you to note that Robbie Keane has been rotated after finally scoring and that means Liverpool are playing their strongest team oh I already have done haven't I?</strong> </p> <p>Man City (4-4-1-1): Hart; Zabaleta, Dunne, Richards, Garrido; Wright-Phillips, Ireland, Kompany, Elano; Robinho; Jo.

It'll be a draw. Mark my words. But I'm not putting any money on it, so mark my words cowardly.\" I totally do, and given that my predictions have a \u201310% success rate (well, if players can have 110%, I'm claiming it, I fully expect Chelsea to win 44-1.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.31pm: Chelsea team news, aka that Ivanovic fell finally gets a game and Villa are unchanged for the seventh straight league game</strong></p> <p>Chelsea (4-3-3): Cech; Bosingwa, Ivanovic, Terry, Ashley Cole; Mikel, Ballack, Lampard; Joe Cole, Anelka, Malouda.

Subs: Guzan, Milner, Harewood, Knight, Salifou, Cuellar, Gardner.</p> <p>Referee: Chris Foy (Merseyside)</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.34pm</strong> They're off again at Upton Park, with no changes on either side. \"Wotcha,\" says James Wood, essaying the only beginning almost as cringeworthy as <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/10/03/audio-hear-joe-kinnear-s-full-unbleeped-uncensored-rant-at-daily-mirror-man-simon-bird-115875-20770121/\">Joe Kinnear's</a>. \"I seem to remember Jonathan Edwards refused to compete on Sundays due to his religious beliefs (something about not feeling comfortable missing the 'Enders omnibus). Does this mean that there are no Prem footieballers that have similar problems with working on Sunday? Apart from Bentley of course.\" The West Ham players seem to making a protest against it today HONK.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.37pm</strong> As you were at West Ham. At ease.</p> <p>\"I always start humming the theme to Steptoe &amp; Son when I think of them - possibly some reference to the schadenfreude that is so prevalent in the Clement/Frenais melancholy and the comparative hubris of Newcastle,\" says Kristian Petterson. \"You can feel free to edit this post when you, naturally, feel compelled to publish its insightful brilliance.\" No can do: the delete button's not working.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> Glorious save from Jaaskelainen. Cole turned 25 yards out and instinctively clipped one towards goal which looped up off the knee of Cahill. Jaaskelainen was a few yards off his line but, just as the ball seem to be drifting over him, he dived left and backwards to fingertip it beautifully off the post and away for a corner. Wonderful save.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.42pm</strong> Bellamy comes on for di Michele, who didn't have the greatest of games, and switch to 4-4-2 as a result.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.47pm</strong> Bolton's midfield terriers have done great work today, particularly the ever-underrated Gavin McCann, 97, although it helps that West Ham keep coming inside with the ball. Ilunga hasn't really got on the ball in the final third since half-time.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong> Zola has talked a lot about letting his players enjoy themselves, and empowering them to play with freedom, but there's a problem there in that the West Ham good, while wonderfully formidable when their side are underdogs, are probably as harsh as any on their players when things are going wrong. It's not easy to be creative when someone's calling you an effing cee all the time. Which, in a different way, might impact upon <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2008/10/03/audio-hear-joe-kinnear-s-full-unbleeped-uncensored-rant-at-daily-mirror-man-simon-bird-115875-20770121/\">Newcastle</a> I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> The excellent McCann tries to place one from 25 yards; it beats Green but goes just wide. He has a remarkable baldness pattern: receding heavily on top, but there's a completely bald bit down the middle, as if somebody's just zoomed the clippers straight down the middle and then got bored and given up. Either that or the Advanced Hair Studio doesn't do what it says on the tin.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.56pm: West Ham 1-2 Bolton (Cole 69)</strong> Carlton Cole gets West Ham back in it. It was a pitiful goal from Bolton's point of view. A long corner from the right was headed back towards his own goal by Samuel, and Cole ran in front of Jaaskelainen to head in off the underside of the bar from a couple of yards. If Bolton blow this, they need their swingers repositioned.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.58pm</strong> The in-no-way-nowhere-near-as-loyal-or-great-as-they-think-they-are West Ham fans are in fine voice now, and it's all moving towards the Bolton goal. Behrami screams one just wide from 25 yards. It's also kick off in four of the other games. Woot woot! </p> <p>\"Plenty of Bobby Moore-branded adverts on those hideously intrusive animated perimeter boards, but that's fair enough at the Boleyn Ground. The great man has been gone over 15 years now (and really should have a posthumous knighthood) but, incredibly, was born in the same year as Sir Alex Ferguson, which shows just how early he was taken. Here's my <a href=\"http://www.bobbymooreonline.co.uk/Website/LI%204.jpg\">my favourite football photograph</a> , showing that football was once a game and not just a business.\" That's not what the Colombian police thought at the time. But yes, amen to all those sentiments, especially the one about the knighthood.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>3.02pm</strong> Bolton bring on Matt Taylor for Johan Elmander, which means Davies to centre-forward I guess, although I don't know who goes right side midfield. It's Taylor in fact, despite being all left foot.</p> <p>In other news, do I stay with this game or go to Sky Sports News for multi-game updates but no live hot guy-on-guy action? Suggestions please.<br> <br>\"Re Newcastle's manager and the press interview,\" says James Boyce. \"I first thought 'what a mouthful' but on reflection surely it was a fuKinnearful?\" FU indeed.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>3.04pm</strong> Here's Joe Mann. \"I am also working on a Sunday, looking forward to aquaplaning home on the M25 in time for (most) of Chelsea v Villa. However, I can't say I'm looking forward to it much. I'm wearing my lucky Chelsea sweatband in conjunction with my lucky Chelsea pants because I'm scared of Villa. I sincerely hope your predictions are as crappy as usual, but alas, your reasoning and scoreline seem sound.\" Is there anything more tragic in life than lucky pants? I suppose my lucky sweatbands don't exactly scream \"urban freewheeler\".</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>3.05pm</strong> Fifteen minutes to go at Upton Park. A quick shift to Sky Sports News shows hat Phil Thompson's not doing the Liverpool game: he's on Spurs v Hull. That's probably put his nose out of joint, an achievement not to be sniffed at.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>3.08pm</strong> Freddie Sears is on for West Ham. I missed who came off as I was flitting between Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports News. Bolton, who have calmed things down well since the goal, bring on Joey O'Brien for Muamba.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.09pm: Spurs 0-1 Hull (Geovanni 9)</strong> Spurs expected fireworks from a Giovani this season, but not like this. Actually that line doesn't work because, inconsiderately, they spell their names different. Anyway, Phil Thompson has an impromptu knee-trembler when Hull's Geovanni blasts a free-kick into the corner. Scoring one goal-of-the-season contender in North London could be considered fortunate; scoring two in two weeks suggests serious talent. Thompson and Merson concur that this goal was better than his goal at Arsenal last week. Blimey.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.13pm</strong> In the live game, West Ham are still huffing and puffing without threatening to blow anything down. Six minutes to go, plus added-time.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.15pm: West Ham 1-3 Bolton (Taylor 86)</strong> The substitute Matt Taylor adds another long-range screamer to his portfolio. It was a free-kick maybe 30 yards out and out towards the right and, with everyone expecting a clipped cross, Taylor just howtized it a few yards off the ground into the far corner. That said, it was <em>fairly</em> central and will probably go down as Robert Green's third mistake of the day. The problem is that everyone was set up for a cross and, in fairness, it was beautifully struck and also veering away into the corner.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.19pm</strong> \"Is there any news from the bank of TV screens you are watching about why Robbie Keane is not starting for Liverpool?\" says Ian Copestake. Bank of screens? Eh? Try a 15-inch Tosumi and we'll go from there. \"It would be nice to hear he just has a knock so as to nip in the bud naughty speculation about Rafa's man-management skills.\" The thing is, though, today's team is Liverpool's best front six, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.22pm: Man City 1-0 Liverpool (Ireland 19)</strong> It's Liverpool's year! Stephen Ireland gives City the lead, although I know nothing about the goal as I was on Sky Sports 1.</p> <p>In other news, that's it at Upton Park. Bolton deservedly claim their first points away from home this season, although their best player was undoubtedly Robert Green.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.23pm: Chelsea 1-0 Aston Villa (J Cole 23)</strong> Joe Cole smashes Chelsea ahead at the near post after a smart pass from Frank Lampard. Apparently it's been a very open game but now Chelsea will probably exert themselves and, as I predicted, win 2-0 or 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.25pm: Everton team news</strong></p> <p>Everton (4-4-2): Howard; Hibbert, Jagielka, Lescott, Baines; Arteta, Osman, Fellaini, Pienaar; Saha, Yakubu. Subs: Nash, Yobo, Castillo, Vaughan, Nuno Valente, Rodwell, Anichebe.</p> <p>Newcastle (4-4-2 with Duff up front by the look of things): Given; Taylor, Coloccini, Cacapa, Jose Enrique; Geremi, Butt, Guthrie, N'Zogbia, Owen, Duff. Subs: Harper, Bassong, Xisco, Ameobi, Edgar, Doninger, Donaldson.</p> <p>Referee: Howard Webb (why on earth would we want to know where he's from, anyway?)</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.26pm</strong> \"Villa are struggling but they haven't conceded yet. I am going to the be optimistic Villa fan for once and say that is good news,\" says George Templeton, patenting the new form of MBM - in which you tell us what's happening - and approximately 0 milliseconds before Joe Cole scored.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.27pm: Portsmouth 1-0 Stoke (Crouch 25)</strong> Okay so technically it was 3.25pm but I'd already used that one. Anyway, Crouch makes it four goals in three games and surely secures three points for Portsmouth already. It was an absolute peach apparently, one of Crouch's overhead kicks. Or, as Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink on Sky Sports news says with a disconcertingly orgiastic smile, \"Crouchy does an overhead kick... like Pele!\"</p> <p>In other news, Chelsea are over Villa apparently. Told you! \"I haven't seen Chelsea play like this,\" says Paul Merson, before deciding not to finish the sentence, just because he can. Still, we got the point.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.32pm</strong> Anyone out there? Robbie's lonely!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong> \"Robert Green was definitely culpable for the first two goals but blaming him for the third is redefining harsh,\" says Roy Allen. \"It swerved all over the place and was travelling faster than Andy Reid chasing the sweet trolley. A great goal.\" I take your point, as it was wonderfully impudent from Taylor, and I'd like to see it again. But his starting position was very poor and he presumptuously put all his weight on his left foot, which left him completely exposed.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.35pm</strong> Here's something worth clicking: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2008/oct/05/football.weekend.pictures?picture=338290856\"> our gallery of the weekend's action</a>.</p> <p>St Mirren have just taken the lead against Rangers with 12 minutes to go, through Stephen McGinn. Token what?</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.37pm: Phil Thompson does another impersonation of Meg Ryan in a coffee shop!</strong> \"Goa- goa- ohhhhhh goodness,\" screams Thommo when Hull's Dean Marney hits the inside of the post against his old club. Hull, eh? Bloody hell.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.40pm</strong> Here's Mike Gibbons. \"Someone mentioned Jonathan Edwards earlier, having wrestled with his conscience over whether to compete on a Sunday or not for years he finally decided that he should - coincidentally at the same time he'd improved enough to be a medal contender at an international championships. Conscientious objection is prevalent in football though - just this year our own England team refused to play in Switzerland in Euro 2008 in protest at the Swiss banks' continued holding of Nazi looted treasure. I think.\"</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.41pm</strong> Rory Delap is going off injured for Stoke, which is a serious blow given that statistics show that they account for 104% of Stoke's goals. At White Hart Lane, Rob Styles books George Boateng for shouting at his own team-mate, Daniel Cousin. Can you book players for that? I suppose they can get sent off for punching each other, but still: get a life, ref. Rumours that Rob Styles has put a little sticker on his arse and his elbow, just so he can be sure, are unconfirmed.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.43pm</strong> \"Dunne as ever is playing immensely against Liverpool,\" says Ian Copestake, continuing this ingenious new MBM model. \"Clearly I was projecting my own anxieties about Rafa with my question about Keane as I fear Rafa has put his foot in it by changing his formation after Keane finally got his confidence back. When he comes on and grabs the equaliser questions will be asked.\" They will. 'What brand of cheese have you been eating to have such funky and absurd dreams?' mainly, but I take your point.</p> <p>The point on Dunne is certainly valid, though. He's outstanding.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.44pm: IT'S LIVERPOOL'S YEAR!</strong> Garrido bends a superb free-kick into the top corner to put Manchester City 2-0 up against Liverpool, while Chelsea also go 2-0 up thanks to Nicolas Anelka, following up after a brilliant save from Brad Friedel. \"This could have been six or seven,\" says Paul Merson.</p> <p>Given the quality of my predictions this weekend, I'm happy to assert that it's already a two-horse title-race. I think this will do all sorts of damage to Liverpool's newfound self-esteem.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>3.45pm</strong> \"If one could get a card for yelling at one's teammates, a goalkeeper would get a red card by the second shot on goal,\" says Brandon Clements, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>3.48pm</strong> It's half time up and down this inglorious country of ours. The scores are:</p> <p>Chelsea (J Cole, Anelka) 2-0 Villa<br>Man City (Ireland, Garrido) 2-0 Liverpool<br>Portsmouth (Crouch) 1-0 Bolton<br>Spurs 0-1 Hull (Geovanni)</p> <p>I'm off to score some Colombian from the coffee machine. See you in a bit.</p> <p>\"Wow,\" says Geoff Ashworth. \"Bolton must be tired after chasing down the M4 to play Portsmouth. No wonder Crouch finally got a goal.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>3.54pm</strong> \"I'm sitting in a hotel on my own in Tajikistan, have had the [insert family website-friendly word for bowel issues; you know, one that doesn't rhyme with 'hits'] for 2 weeks and my boss is coming out tomorrow to look at work I haven't done because I can't read Russian or speak Tajik,\" begins Pete. \"I was watching live updates on NTV Spor and keeping an eye on Juve, but the hotel has decided to scramble that signal now. Is anyone in a more depressing situation, just to raise my spirits with a bit of schadenfreude? Responses from White Hart Lane aside....\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>3.56pm</strong> \"I agree that it's a two-horse race for the title,\" says Gary Naylor, lining up the inevitable punchline, \"although I feel Hull will need a signing or two in January to push Chelsea all the way 'til May.\" He's here once a week ladies and gentlemen. Actually that's not true: he's here seven days a week, 24 hours a day.</p> <p>Seriously, though, Hull? Bloody hell.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>3.57pm</strong> If Liverpool lose, Benitez is going to get slaughtered for dropping Keane. I actually still think it was his best team, but of course these decisions are invariably judged with hindsight. He'll get <em>savaged</em>.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>3.59pm</strong> In other news, I've just seen the first Chelsea goal and it's a gem: a really slick move across the face of the box culminating with an emphatic finish from Cole. There is no question that Scolari has changed the DNA of the club. The second was really harsh on Brad Friedel, who made an excellent double save from the onrushing Ballack, only for Anelka to clip the loose ball in.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.01pm</strong> Right, we're off again. It's a big 45 minutes for, in no particular order: Rafa Benitez, Juande Ramos, David Bentley, Andy Dawson, Ed Chamberlain, Robinho and Ryan Reynolds.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.07pm</strong> Villa have brought Cuellar and Milner on for Davies and Luke Young, while Di Santo is on for Anelka. Petrov drives just wide from 20 yards. Liverpool are denied an apparently decent claim for a penalty when Dunne sits on Dirk Kuyt inside the first minute of the second half. Actually that does look a penalty: Dunne, running behind Kuyt, knocks one leg onto the other and sends Kuyt tumbling. I don't think Dunne meant it, the blessed lummox, but it looked a foul.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.08pm: Portsmouth 1-1 Stoke (Fuller)</strong> Delap didn't go off injured after all, and a long throw produces an equaliser. Kitson flicked on the throw and Fuller did the rest. Well, well.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong> Portsmouth, their swingers cattle-prodded by the Fuller goal, come to life and Defoe hits the post. \"I'm in Brisbane, staring down the barrel of seven assignments due in the next sixteen days, including three in the next three days, and finals in less than a month,\" says Russell Yong. \"In typical third-year uni student form, I have somewhat masochistically chosen to focus on this clockwatch more than the blank Word page open on the other side, having resigned myself to pleading avian malaria in the hopes of getting another ill-gotten due date extension. On a bright note, Hull are doing well. Feel free to laugh.\" You're in Brisbane. I'm in England. You're you. I'm me. <em>What the hell have I got to laugh about?</em></p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.11pm: Portsmouth (Defoe) 2-1 Stoke</strong> Within a minute of hitting the post, Defoe gives Pompey the lead.</p> <p>\"Newcastle's Argentine Fabricio Coloccini looks more like his fellow countryman and defender Alberto Tarantini than anyone should in 2008,\" notes Gary Naylor. I've seen worse hairdos, mainly in mirrors.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.12pm</strong> Juande Ramos, whose maverick substitutions have been a feature of his career, usually for good, has put - and you'll like this - David Bentley at right-back in place of Chris Gunter. </p> <p>\"Rob, any moaning about Liverpool won't just be from hindsight as I got mine started as soon as the team sheet was announced,\" says Ian Copestake, and he did, it's true, so all bow down and wash his feet. \"Keane is no saviour but he was getting better and settling in. Drop him now and one is asking for problems.\" True that, but Alonso's been your best player this season, no? So who do your drop? Kuyt and put Gerrard wide right, maybe, but we all know that Stevie G is the greatest central midfielder in the history of the world - he's scored 100 goals! From only 7,312,124,157 shots! - and now even Rafa seems loath to put him wide.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.15pm: Man City 2-1 Liverpool (Torres 55)</strong> Liverpool are back in it thanks to yet another away goal from Torres, who has already scored more goals away from Anfield in the league than he did all last season. Gerrard slid Arbeloa behind the defence on the right with a good first-time pass, and his sidefooted cross across the six-yard box was touched in by Torres. A slick, one-touch goal from Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.19pm: Everton 1-0 Newcastle (Arteta pen 17)</strong> A needless lunge from Nicky Butt on Leighton Baines (who was almost certainly offside when the ball was played to him) gives Everton a penalty, and the wonderful Arteta rolls it coolly into the corner. That's a barely fathomable error from someone of Butt's experience, and he knows it, walking away with his face betraying the sort of shame and regret usually seen by those queuing outside Wetherspoons waiting for it to open on a Monday morning.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.22pm</strong> Ballack hoofs hilariously over from six yards, having planted his standing foot to the point that his left could only slice the ball over. That's a disgusting miss. I feel unclean just watching it. It's all Chelsea, though.</p> <p>\"On a brighter note, I've just found some pistachio nuts in my fridge,\" says Pete. \"And the tele's started working - showing a re-run of Athletico's drubbing at the hands of Barca. Iniesta's haircut is enough to make anyone feel a little chirpier - even Gavin McCann. Tajikistan 1 - 0 Brisbane.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> Terrible miss from Robinho. The rejuvenated Wright-Phillips runs 70 yards unchallenged, then skins Aurelio and clips a wonderful ball across the face of the goal. It takes Reina out of the game but Robinho, on the stretch, volleys over an open goal from four yards. Those aren't as easy as they look, but still, that's what \u00a332m gets you these days.</p> <p>Robinho, like Baines, was offside by the way, but it wasn't given.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.27pm: Zabaleta sent off for Man City</strong> For the second week in a row, a flying challenge on Alonso brings a straight red. But this week it was the right decision: it was a horrible attempt at winning the ball from Zabaleta, and his studs went <em>right</em> into Alonso's ankle on the full. You can't do that anymore. Mark Hughes is livid, but his opinion is worth less and less since he disappeared up his own hubris. It was definitely a straight red.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.32pm</strong> Chelsea are putting on a masterclass of passing and movement. Villa's response is, er, Marlon Harewood, for John Carew.</p> <p>Liverpool are bringing on Dossena for Aurelio, and Keane for Mascherano, so Gerrard drops back into midfield and Keane goes into the hole. City bring on Gelson Fernandes for Jo.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.33pm: Man City 2-2 Liverpool (Torres 73)</strong> It might actually be Liverpool's year, especially if they pull this off. A superb, swirling corner from Gerrard is flicked beautifully into the corner by the wonderful Torres, and Phil Thompson has a smile that it would be my absolute pleasure to wipe from his face, were I so permitted.</p> <p>\"Re: Pete,\" begins Brisbane's Russell Yong. \"No telly - housemate's on the Wii - but Brisbane to draw level on the basis of a large tin of Danish butter cookies and hot tea. That said it's done nothing to relieve the pressure that shall soon wreak a rather exotic-looking receding hairline all my own.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.37pm</strong> \"I didn't realise that Wetherspoons had mirrored windows,\" chuckles Andy Bradshaw, before ruining it all by using a smiley. \"If Hull win at Spurs does that make it, along with Kinnear's press conference, the funniest week in Premiership history?\" Nah. Not even a week scripted by comedy geniuses - say the Two Pints Of Lager And A Packet Of Crisps writing team - could produce another funnier than when Glenn Hoddle paid over \u00a38m for Dean Richards will take some beating.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>4.37pm: Everton 2-0 Newcastle (Fellaini 34)</strong> Deja vu all over again for Newcastle. Baines whips a cross to the near post, and Fellaini gets in front of Coloccini and Given to stab in his first goal for Everton. Decent finish, that.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.40pm</strong> It's all Liverpool now against City's 10 men. Modric misses a sitter for Spurs at White Hart Lane. If they lose they will equal their worst-ever start to a league season, which took place in 1912-13, it says here.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>4.41pm</strong> Ched Evans comes on for Robinho, Benayoun comes on for Riera, and then Torres has a great chance for a glorious hat-trick: on the stretch, he scooped a low Keane cross over the top from three yards out. Liverpool are going to win this: their rising tide is engulfing City.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>4.47pm</strong> Five minutes to go at City, and indeed elsewhere.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>4.48pm</strong> Skrtel looks like he's done himself a serious concern, which is a concern both in the short- (Liverpool have used all three subs) and long-term. It was a pretty innocuous chase with Ched Evans, but as he landed his knee twisted quite horribly, almost behind him. The stretcher is on and he's being given oxygen. That looks very, very nasty.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>4.49pm: Everton 2-1 Newcastle (Taylor 45)</strong> Big goal for Newcastle on the stroke of half-time. Geremi flings in an excellent deep cross from the right and Steven Taylor, beyond the far post, rams a superb header in off the underside of the bar. I'm not sure what he's doing there, as it was from open play, but it was a storming header.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>4.50pm</strong> It's ten-a-side at Man City, with Skrtel stretchered off. He's got his hands over his head and his leg strapped: I'm afraid there are no happy endings with this one. It has to be some form of ligament damage.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>4.52pm: it really might be Liverpool's year!</strong> Dirk Kuyt has won it for Liverpool! Benayoun broke down the left before pulling it back to Torres on the penalty spot. When his shot was blocked, Kuyt sidefooted in for four yards. That's a decent finish actually, because Hart sprawled across the line of the ball but Kuyt was cool enough to get enough height on it to clear the keeper. An amazing comeback from 2-0 down at half-time.</p> <p>It's impossible to overstate the psychological value of a victory like this. The Liverpool players are going <em>absolutely mental</em>. As I said at half-time, it's definitely a three-horse race this year.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>4.53pm</strong> It's over at White Hart Lane: Spurs 0-1 Hull. Hull? Bloody hell. Chelsea have also beaten Villa 2-0. It could have been six or seven. Portsmouth have beaten Stoke 2-1.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>4.54pm</strong> \"Luka Modric must be the worst signing of the close season,\" says Gary Naylor. \"In the most physical league in the world, he is a Kate Moss amongst the Katie Prices.\" I'm too depressed to comment.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>4.57pm</strong> That's it: Liverpool have clinched a simply massive victory over Manchester City, having been 2-0 down at half-time. </p> <p>So that's that apart from the second half at Goodison. If you don't want to know the scores, a) why are you reading a text-based website, you nugget? and b) look away now:</p> <p><strong>Chelsea 2-0 Villa<br>Everton 2-1 Newcastle (half-time)<br>Man City 2-3 Liverpool<br>Portsmouth 2-1 Stoke<br>Spurs 0-1 Hull<br>West Ham 1-3 Bolton</strong></p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>4.59pm</strong> I'm off for a break. See you for the second half at Goodison.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>5.08pm</strong> Off we go again at Goodison. It's a pretty big half for these two downtrodden clubs.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>5.09pm: Everton 2-2 Newcastle (Duff 47)</strong> Blimey. Two goals in quick succession, either side of half-time, have brought Newcastle back in the game. Taylor broke down the right - he might have been offside, but then so was Baines for the first goal - and fizzed an excellent low cross which was missed by Owen but swept in by Duff from eight yards. Brilliant work from Taylor, whose desire and enterprise have dragged Newcastle kicking and screaming back into this game.</p> <p>Kinnear, incidentally, missed both goals as he moved to and from his seat in the directors' box either side of half-time.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>5.11pm</strong> \"If Joe Kinnear is only to be in the job for 6-8 weeks surely for comic effect the new full-time boss must be someone who can keep up the phenomenal level of potty-mouthed swearing,\" says Mike Gibbons. \"The next Newcastle manager must - MUST - be Susie Green from Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" Imagine the offspring of her and Cussin' Joe.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>5.15pm</strong> Everton are a bag of nerves, conscious of the fact that they've lost all three games at home in the league this season and are now in dangerous of losing a fourth to one of the bigger showers in football history. Except they're not anymore: Newcastle are pushing about like recovering amnesiacs who have remembered that, actually, they used to be quite competent at playing this game. A smart effort from Duff, 12 yards out and trying to place it in the far corner, is blocked by Lescott.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>5.18pm</strong> Louis Saha, suddenly fit again and showing that his injuries at Old Trafford were in no way psychosomatic, almost scores a glorious own-goal, slicing a mishit corner from Duff into the side netting at the near post. N'Zogbia then forces a rudimentary save from Howard from range. I never thought I'd be typing these words today but <em>I am actually a ladybo-</em>, sorry, I mean, <em>it's all Newcastle</em>.</p> <p>\"Ha ha,\" says Lee Calvert, presuming mirth when there's none in this house. \"After a long weekend of sampling what it's like to be a lone parent, I was hoping today would bring plenty to cheer me up. Instead, I have had to listen to an heroic Liverpool comeback with the winner scored by that ginger fraud Dirk Kuyt. Still, at least Spurs lost. Man City should beware the notion of buying success, Tottenham spent \u00a377m on that shower.\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>5.20pm (aka 57mins)</strong> \"If Newcastle want a manager to maintain Joe F'Kinnear's rate of expletives,\" begins Gary Naylor, \"they could pick any Everton fan right now.\" What <em>has</em> happened? Everton looked, last season, like a team with such a solid spine and tactical set-up that there was only so much that could go wrong. It's bewildering to see them so ragged and so insecure, particularly defensively.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>5.22pm</strong> The psychology of sport, eh? Bloody hell.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>5.26pm</strong> Everton have a decent if insignificant spell of possession. This game is so precariously poised because both sides have the yips, like a tennis match in which both players keep dropping their serve.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>5.27pm</strong> Superb save from Given. Osman clattered one first-time from the left of the box, and Given reached up to push it over. It was superb from Osman, who had no right to manufacture such a decent effort from such a prohibitive angle.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>5.30pm</strong> You suspect that both sides would take this at the moment, but ultimately a draw's a better result for Newcastle. The trouble is that they know that and have adjusted their game accordingly, subconsciously sitting in and settling for a draw, and Everton are just building something resembling momentum as a consequence. All this needs is John Goodman screaming \"I'll show you the life of the mind!\" because it's hard to recall a sporting contest in which the minds and souls of all the participants have been laid so bare. </p> <p>\"It's the psychology of team sport that troubles Everton,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Players are communicating anxiety to each other, multiplying it, like a wave building at sea. That's why the manager is so crucial - he has to radiate the self-belief required to flatten the anxiety. Not so easy to do if, like David Moyes, you're still quibbling over a contract renewal.\" I think that's absolutely a fair point. It's not entirely dissimilar to the farce that was the first half of Manchester United's 2001-02 season, when everybody thought Fergie was retiring at the end of the season. The sense of asphyxiating insecurity \u2013 particularly in home games \u2013 was very similar.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>5.33pm (aka 70mins)</strong> Oof. Coloccini, unmarked, wins Geremi's corner and nods it towards the six-yard box, but Owen, who had a decent bit of space, couldn't control it with his left foot. A chance, that.</p> <p>Substitution time: it's Anichebe for Saha, like for like. Moments later, Albert Hammond Fellaini Jr is booked for persistent offending.</p> <p>Here's Lee Calvert. \"Given the extremely specific criteria the NUFC fans lay down for any managerial candidates: Geordie (or honorary status), fan of the club, record of success at highest level, flair for creativity, and occasional delusions about importance of job and place in the great scheme of things. Step forward Mr Tony Blair. Do I get a honk? Or five pounds?\" Would a restraining order do?</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>5.36pm</strong> Geremi takes one for the team, cynically defiling Pienaar to stop an Everton counter-attack. Well ok, he didn't defile him so much as foul him. I've always gotta romanticise stuff.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>5.37pm (aka 74mins)</strong> Geremi is replaced by Shola Ameobi. He goes up front and Duff moves to the right-wing.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>5.40pm</strong> And so it swings again, as Newcastle have a decent spell. Given that Everton's next two games are Arsenal and Manchester United, a defeat doesn't bear thinking about here. Fellaini wrestles Butt to the floor on the edge of the area, but Guthrie's free-kick goes straight into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>5.40pm</strong> Heroic clearance from Baines on the line. Ameobi muscles past Lescott to front up Howard, squares it to N'Zogbia six yards out, and his stab towards goal is cleared for a corner by Baines. What a huge escape for Everton.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>5.42pm</strong> Now it's <em>New</em>castle who look the team most likely (not to have an epic nervous breakdown right there on the field). If anyone is going to score a winner, it's them, although that will probably change again in the next few minutes. This is such a bizarre game of football.</p> <p>\"I like Lee Calvert's person spec for the manager's job at NUFC,\" says Gary Naylor, \"but I'd go with Terry Collier of the Likely Lads, as he would do the plaintive sense of non-fulfilment too.\"</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>5.44pm</strong> Is there anything more confusing that when spam emails hit the spot, and for those few seconds you wonder 'How did they know?' before you realise it's spam. To wit, \"Put your most intimate problems to bed,\" says Dayne.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>5.48pm</strong> Huge shout for a penalty for Everton. Yakubu was through on the right of the box, but he actually overhit his cross to Anichebe. However, Anichebe had got in a right tangle with Taylor and went over. Replays weren't conclusive either way, but, as everyone says, they've been given. There's no way Anichebe was getting to the ball, although that's not really relevant so I don't know why I said it. In your face economical word-use!</p> <p>Meanwhile, Vaughan is on for Pienaar and now it's Everton who are pushing for a winner. </p> <p>\"Dear Rob,\" says Mac Millings. \"I looked it up, and defile (5.36pm) means:<br>1.to make foul, dirty, or unclean; pollute; taint; debase; 2.to violate the chastity of; 3.to make impure for ceremonial use; desecrate; 4.to sully, as a person's reputation. Is that really your definition of 'romantic'?\" You've never lived in Rochester have you?</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>5.49pm</strong> Oof. A delicious effort from Anichebe curls <em>just</em> wide of the far post from the left corner of the box. Shay Given wasn't getting there at all.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>5.50pm</strong> At the other end, Ameobi tries one of those classy, Thierry Henry out-to-in finishes. It goes - at a conservative estimate - five yards wide. Know your limits, son.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>5.51pm</strong> A very harsh free-kick goes against Duff wide on the Everton left, in a really dangerous position. Arteta clips it in but Yakubu, six yards out, heads it onto his own shoulder and thus takes all the pace off it, allowing Given to claim. That was a real chance; he just mistimed his jump.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>5.52pm</strong> There will be three minutes of added time. I'd love to know what David Moyes' blood pressure is just now.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>5.55pm. Full time: Everton 2-2 Newcastle</strong> That's the end of a remarkable contest, in which both sides seem to be competing to show which was having the bigger nervous breakdown. Ultimately it's a better result for Newcastle, not least because they were 2-0 down before the admirable Steven Taylor took it upon himself to do something about it, but both sides were all over the place mentally. There are no quick fixes for these particular showers, but at least they inadvertently provided 90 minutes of unmissable car-crash TV.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>Right, that's that</strong> Six games, 19 goals, three showers, and at the end of it all Chelsea stay top and Spurs stay bottom. Oh and Hull are now third. Thanks for all your emails. Clockwatches? Bloody hell.</p>"
