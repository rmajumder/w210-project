  "<p>The Icelandic police thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/120933/jar.city\">Jar City</a> hit UK cinemas at the weekend and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/sep/14/thriller\">won round the</a> critics with its brooding mood and sense of the absurd. </p> <p>No surprise: the crime movie is by far the most popular genre on these shores. Sweden has produced more than a dozen Kurt Wallander <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v45t2sVpq4\">features</a> - the diabetic inspector created by writer Henning Mankell (also popular in the UK). The latest offering from Denmark is Terribly Happy, a thriller about a village constable struggling with the skeletons in his closet. <br> In the country where I live, Norway, we've already had two features in less a year about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NgM5pn6XdE\">Varg Veum</a>, a bearded (and quite dashing) private eye solving cases in the coastal city of Bergen, with three more movies expected in the coming year. For people here, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1_mETVsCac\">Insomnia</a> was not a crime drama starring Al Pacino as a bleary-eyed cop wandering the streets of an Alaskan town. It was a 1997 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119375/\">thriller</a> starring a bone-chillling Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd wandering sleepless in the Norwegian Arctic town of Troms\u00f8. Christopher Nolan remade it for an international audience. <br> The common thread among all these movies is of crimes shattering the fabric of quiet, peaceful communities. They are the Nordic versions of Miss Marple and Midsomer Murders, but with one crucial difference: film-makers here make their movies seriously dark and brooding. That lush green fjord where you think you will enjoy a nice picnic? Under the light of a Scando cinematographer, it becomes a place of torment where serial killers prey on their victims and untold horrors lurk beneath the waters. The weather helps of course: when parts of these countries are bathed in 24-hour darkness for months on end, it helps create that \"dark and stormy night\" feel - that favourite clich\u00e9 of crime writers.  Crime movies are a staple everywhere, of course. But my feeling is that the genre is particularly popular in Nordic countries because these are really safe societies, with very little crime. The safer people feel, the more they need to give themselves the heebie jeebies. It's like a reading And Then There Were None at home by a fire, alone at night: you need to scare yourself a little to feel really comfy.  Some Scando crime movies have even riffed on the lack of violence. The best was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0sasz3Q2jc\">Kops</a>, a 2003 comedy about police officers in small town Sweden who, realising their police station is going to be shut down because there are no crimes to solve, start robbing corner shops. I have always wondered whether Simon Pegg saw it before making Hot Fuzz. What's good enough for Christopher Nolan...</p>",
  "<p>In 1677, the most unpopular law of the old customary code was finally abolished in France. Congr\u00e8s was defined by the Fruti\u00e8re dictionary as: \"the practice of coitus ordered by decree of an ecclesiastical judge, performed in the presence of surgeons and matrons, to discover whether a man is potent, with a view to dissolving a marriage.\" </p> <p>The reason it was scrapped had, of course, nothing to do with public decency. Rather it was because the authorities belatedly came to realise that the exercise did not elicit conclusive proof of impotence. \"Our organs do not always obey us when we would like them to, still less so in front of judges,\" blubbed one contemporary, as quoted in Nina Epton's delicious 1959 opus Love and the French. <br> Whatever about Bordeaux, the pressure of public scrutiny certainly didn't perturb Chelsea, on whom most European eyes surely were. A dominant first half display indicated that the favourites tag does not weigh particularly heavily on them, and that Phil Scolari's lack of experience in the Champions League is no barrier either. Stiffer challenges than Bordeaux await, of course, but Chelsea were certainly more convincing tonight than they were against Rosenborg this time last season. Then again, all that really suggests is that Scolari is at least as comfortable in this tournament as another novice was last season \u2013 Avram Grant.  The absence of a proper challenge from Bordeaux seemed to bore Chelsea, who lapsed into indifference in the second half. This probably irritated English spectators but it should have given them cause for gratitude. Because the sight of last season's Ligue 1 runners-up being effortlessly crushed by the team who finished second in the Premier League should have shut up any English people who whinge about the abundance of foreigners plying their trade over here. Instead, those people should count their blessings: specifically the number of top English players that play in this country. If the money were elsewhere, English fans would wind up watching teams such as Bordeaux every week. Frank Lampard and Joe Cole wouldn't be regularly scoring at the Bridge, but in the Nou Camp, the Allianz Arena or - who knows? - even the Home Depot Center. Michel Platini was the only member of the French Euro '84 squad who played his club football outside his homeland (indeed, only one of eight finalists had more than two players who played for clubs outside their own country). Now all the best French players play abroad, or will do once Karim Benzema leaves Lyon, as he inevitably will before he reaches his prime. Former Lyon goalkeeper Gregory Coupet said last season that Ligue 1 is \"the best youth league in Europe\" and he's right in the sense that it continues to produce exquisite young players. </p> <p>The problem is these are quickly lured away to wealthier lands. So French clubs are now staffed by promising novices who'll soon be snapped up, cut-price imports who'll also be snapped up if they excel (as Chelsea's Petr Cech, Michael Essien or Didier Drogba could confirm) or returned exiles who'll emigrate again given the chance \u2013 thus the spine of Bordeaux's team tonight was Souleymane Diawara, who flopped at Charlton, Alou Diarra, who didn't get a single first-team game for Liverpool during five seasons at Anfield, and Yoan Gourcouff, who's a more ingenious player than he was able to show tonight but is only back in France on loan from AC Milan. <br> If Cole and Lampard's starring role should convince Englanders to be thankful for what they've got, Florent Malouda and Nicolas Anelka's second-half goals will have deepened the sense of loss for French fans and anyone else who yearns for the days when European football was more balanced.</p>",

  "<p>If it wasn't for the teenagers casually hovering outside the building where Shauneen Lambe works in west London, it would look like any anonymous law office on any high street in the country. Inside, there is a constant hubbub generated by the stream of youngsters drifting in and out. Lambe, whose charity provides legal assistance and general support to disadvantaged and excluded young people, accepts that it's an unconventional set-up. \"I absolutely love all the kids I work with,\" she says. \"Sometimes, they'll drive me crazy. These kids are intimidating to the world. But they are entertaining and they are brilliant. Every day the kids come in and I think: 'Yeah, that's what I like.'\"</p> <p>Many of the children she works with are in dire circumstances. Talking about why she and her colleague, Aika Stephenson, started up Just For Kids (JfK) in 2006, her conversation is littered with tragic individual stories, tales of political indifference or meddling, and shocking examples of the mistreatment of young people caught up in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Lambe speaks calmly, but her frustrations are implicit in everything she describes. The case of one of her most recent clients, known as \"AC\", illustrates, she says, much of what is fundamentally wrong with the youth justice system and why it often exacerbates the problems it is supposed to be allaying. AC had no record of criminal behaviour when he was sent to Oakhill secure training centre (STC), aged 14, in May last year after being wrongly charged (he was later exonerated) with grievous bodily harm. While in Oakhill, he was assaulted by an inmate. \"AC was deeply vulnerable,\" Lambe explains. \"If we hadn't got him out on bail, he would have had to spend three months there. In court, you could see he was depressed.\"</p> <p>Distraught at the effect even a short incarceration was having on her son after one week, AC's mother turned to Lambe, who, as well as running JfK, is an in-house barrister at the firm Lawrence and Co, and head of its youth team. \"The ironic thing [about the case] is that because he'd never been in trouble before, the youth offending team (YOT) couldn't provide a risk assessment for him, so were saying: 'We don't want to offer a bail package because we don't know his risk,'\" says Lambe.</p> <p>Lambe convinced the judge to place AC, while a risk assessment was done, under the supervision of his aunt and uncle in a different area to the one where the alleged attack took place. \"That's when JfK got involved,\" Lambe says. \"We got him a mentor. They met every week and did some constructive activities. The thing about AC was that after he came out [of the STC], he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder because of the whole experience.\"</p> <p>She says AC's case is important because not only was his obvious vulnerability ignored at every stage of the justice process, his treatment is symptomatic of a broader problem. \"The problematic thing is that youths are seen as out of control, and so we are incarcerating more than anywhere in western Europe. And we incarcerate younger.\"</p> <p>To make matters worse, Lambe suggests, not only are young people such as AC being unnecessarily introduced to the children's prison system and put at risk, but too often the triggers for their encounters with the law are avoidable, trivial and even absurd. \"AC tells a story,\" says Lambe. \"He says: 'When I was five years old I wanted to be a police officer, but when I was 12 and I got my head jumped on by a police officer in a puddle and told I was a jungle bug, I lost respect for the police.'\" Lambe adds: \"The system tells them that they don't belong. And they end up in the criminal justice system, where no one understands them.\"</p> <p>Then there are the really \"bizarre\" and frustrating cases. \"Take looked-after children,\" Lambe says. \"There are boroughs trying to apply for asbos against children when they are supposed to be the [substitute] parent. It's shocking. I had a kid in court for criminal damage to a chair in a children's home.\"</p> <p><strong>Ongoing support</strong></p> <p>While JfK was set up to fill a gap in legal provision for young people, Lambe says that she and Stephenson recognised that those children most likely to end up in the system also needed \"much more\" than a legal representation. By offering ongoing support such as mentoring, and by being \"very much community-based\" with an \"open door\" policy, Lambe believes JfK is in a position to make a real difference, even if to only a small number of children. They have about 40 clients at any one time.</p> <p>The formality of the youth justice system and its emphasis on enforcement is off-putting for many youngsters, she says. \"Kids often see it as an extension of the police. YOTs are always perceived as part of the punishment. We are lucky. JfK [isn't seen as] part of an enforcement regime.\"</p> <p>Lambe grew up in Ascot, Berkshire, and went on to study philosophy and religion at Edinburgh University before taking her Bar exams and joining the legal profession. She says she \"had no idea what I was on course for\" when she started her career, and that it never occurred to her that she would become known for doing poorly-paid legal advocacy for disadvantaged kids. Nevertheless, she won a Woman of the Year award in 2007, and in 2006 was named on Management Today magazine's \"35 Women under 35\" list of high-flying young women in business.</p> <p>\"I kind of fell into it by doing death penalty work,\" Lambe explains. For three years, she worked alongside Clive Stafford Smith, the British-born lawyer famous for his defence of prisoners on death row in the US. It was, she says, \"the most amazing journey, although at the time it was the most depressing thing that ever happened to me\". Lambe worked on and won a number of cases involving innocent children who were sentenced to death in the southern state of Louisiana. \"I was working in the most racist parish in Louisiana, where the district attorneys wore a tie with a hangman's noose on it while they are sentencing people to death.\"</p> <p>It was tough work, but Lambe credits Stafford Smith with inspiring her to persevere, and for providing \"a fantastically supportive environment\" in which to take on such difficult work. She recalls visiting one of her young clients, who was \"caged for the rest of his life\", and him telling her despairingly: \"I should have got shot in the street like a dog.\"</p> <p>The scale of youth incarceration in Louisiana had an intense impact on Lambe. \"Angola prison just incarcerates young black men until they die,\" she says of the notorious jail in which some of her defendants were locked up. \"I thought: 'What a waste. There has to be more that can be done. These aren't bad kids. There's a reason why they got into these situations.'\"</p> <p>She resists over-analysing what motivates her, but says the enduring injustice faced by children from poorer backgrounds in Britain - if not quite the same as those in Louisiana - is the driving force.</p> <p>Of all the injustices Lambe has encountered, the one that resonates is the inappropriate use of physical restraint on young people when they are incarcerated. The deaths of Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt in 2004, after being restrained in STCs, put its use in the spotlight.</p> <p>Last year's move by the government to extend the circumstances in which restraint could be used to maintain \"good order and discipline\" was widely criticised. Its subsequent overturning by the court of appeal in July this year in a ruling that declared the new rules unlawful was \"really important\", says Lambe, whose client AC's case was the one brought to the court to challenge the government's actions. \"The government passed a statutory instrument without consultation,\" Lambe says. \"To me, it's a total anathema. If you start using physical discipline on people, then they will respond in the same way. These are already the most vulnerable children [as a result of] being in an STC.\"</p> <p><strong>Detrimental impact</strong></p> <p>The victory was an important one for young people's rights, Lambe says, but she is anxious to point out that multiple hurdles to getting justice remain. As \"profit-making businesses\", she says STCs are \"fundamentally wrong\" and can't be expected to deliver the best services. Cuts in legal aid are having a detrimental impact on representation, too. \"We are now no longer paid for the time it takes us to travel to visit our clients,\" she says. \"These kids are being penalised.\"</p> <p>Lambe is frustrated by a system she believes is repeatedly criminalising young people, and by what she says is a cultural climate in which the media and politicians stoke up fear of children. Yet she still believes that things could change for the better, if there was \"a recognition that bad behaviour doesn't make a bad person\". She warns: \"All of this criminalising a generation is going to come back in the government's face.\"</p> <p>As for JfK, there are no plans to expand it. \"It is necessarily community-based, and we have to fight so hard for every bit of funding,\" Lambe says. But she would love to see the model adopted elsewhere. \"What I most want is for the kids we work with, the ones who slip through the net, to get the same resources as other children in our society. A lot of the kids we work with are real fighters to have even survived.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.justforkidslaw.org\">justforkidslaw.org</a></p>",

Photograph: Marizu/Booktrust</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Carolyn Proudfoot's doormat has become one of the most exciting places in her house. The children in her foster care are part of the Letterbox Club, aimed at improving looked-after children's literacy and numeracy. And once a month, for six months, a package addressed to the children and filled with books, games and other goodies arrives through the letterbox.</p> <p>\"It's so special to these youngsters, who have had no personal possessions at all,\" Proudfoot says. \"Just receiving anything through the post is wonderful for them, and the package is full of things they can use and have of their own.\" </p> <p>Proudfoot, who lives in Suffolk, signed up for the pilot Letterbox Club scheme, which was set up in 2003 by Leicester University, in partnership with Leicester city council and Suffolk county council, in response to looked-after children underperforming at school. She has since fostered three children who are club members.</p> <p>\"The biggest benefit is their confidence to have a go at reading,\" Proudfoot says. \"With some of the children who arrive here, no one has taken an interest in their reading. Before this scheme, the children were not interested in picking up a book, but now they want to. Also, you'd be surprised by the number of older children who have never held money before. Counting out the plastic money from the games helps with their mathematics and teaches them the value of money.\"</p> <p>Proudfoot's personal experience of the club's success is heavily backed up by research. Sixteen of the councils that took part last year, when the scheme was rolled out across 21 local authorities in England and Wales, provided positive feedback for a total of 316 children (147 girls and 169 boys). Results, published this week, showed a marked improvement in literacy skills for seven- to 11-year-olds.</p> <p>Reading scores, measured by the Neale analysis of reading ability, showed that, prior to the Letterbox Club, the children involved had lower than average national reading scores for their age group. Of the looked-after children, the worst readers had scores of 69 to 89, compared with the standardised average of 100, but the number in this group dropped from a third to less than a quarter after joining the club, while those with good reading scores of 111 to 131 jumped from 16% to 23%. </p> <p>The maths results were also encouraging, with 40% of the Letterbox children increasing their scores by at least one national curriculum level. </p> <p>National charity Booktrust, which now runs the scheme across more than 50 councils, with funding from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, says the club cannot take all the credit for the results, as schooling has also played a part. It is also keen to emphasise that while the statistics are very positive, what also makes the club a success is that it encourages young people to read, and to do it with their carers at home. Letterbox Club project managers continue to examine the feedback from the children and their carers. There have been requests for more picture-led books and help for carers uncertain about the best ways to support their child's reading. </p> <p>The club is open to children at key stage 2 (aged seven to 11). Marian Keen-Downs, Letterbox Club programme manager, explains: \"This is the stage when they most need a boost to get their reading and numeracy work up to scratch before secondary education. It's the age when we felt we could make the biggest difference.\"</p> <p>From next year, the Letterbox Club will be available nationally. Once enrolled in the club, each child receives a parcel, which contains a letter for them, a maths game (matched to the child's personal attainment for national curriculum levels 1 to 4), two books with an accompanying CD, and stationery items such as pencils, exercise books and stickers. Booktrust trains local council staff in how to assess the reading levels of the children before and after they joined Letterbox. The children also fill out a questionnaire on how they found the project. </p> <p>\"We always check with the local council to ensure that the children's names are on each package and that they are spelled correctly,\" Keen-Downs says. \"We want them to take ownership of their parcel and feel comfortable to take the books with them, because often these young people are only in places for a short amount of time.\" </p> <p>More than 1,000 children have participated in the Letterbox Club so far. One of those, 11-year-old Sarah, remembers clearly receiving her first package. \"I was really excited and wanted to know what was inside,\" she says. \"It was a copy of the book Bad Bad Cats [by Roger McGough].\" And does she think the Letterbox Club is important? \"Yes, because it helps children learn,\" she says. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booktrust.org.uk/national-programmes/letterbox-club\">booktrust.org.uk/national-programmes/letterbox-club</a></p>",
  "<p>Downing Street was yesterday desperately trying to keep a lid on the disorganised rebellion against Gordon Brown after David Cairns, a Scottish Office minister, resigned from the government, saying there had to be a leadership debate to clear the air. He appears to have been forced out after No 10 confronted him on Monday night in the wake of a report by a BBC reporter with strong Scottish connections hinting that a minister of state was on the verge of quitting. </p> <p>Downing Street denied that it had been involved in leaking Cairns's name and called for unity at a time of economic turmoil. </p> <p>A number of cabinet ministers yesterday rallied strongly behind Brown, and Labour's national executive rejected a call for the distribution of leadership nomination forms, the key demand of the rebels.</p> <p>The NEC said there was no legal requirement to send out the forms under the party's rules. </p> <p>Cairns's resignation was dismissed by loyalist Labour MPs as \"no big surprise\". They pointed out that he had been a former researcher to Siobhain McDonagh, one of the leading rebels. They also attached blame to him for his involvement in the recent failed Labour byelection campaign in Glasgow East against the SNP. </p> <p>But Cairns, widely respected for his decency, denied he was part of an orchestrated plot. He said that he had counselled rebels against calling for a leadership election, saying he had told them the move \"was not particularly wise, strategic or going anywhere, so I did not think it was a great idea\". </p> <p>He added: \"What is really depressing me is that someone somewhere leaked their names, so that this debate has started. </p> <p>\"It is going on now, whether we pretend it is or not, and rather than seize this opportunity to have that debate my government chose to diminish these people, claiming they were malcontents, that they were stupid, that they did not speak for anyone.\" </p> <p>Cairns added: \"Collective responsibility does matter, and if you cannot accept that you have to go.\"</p> <p>Downing Street has denied that it has briefed against the rebels, or attempted to flush them out well ahead of the Labour conference. It also denied that it had disclosed Cairns's name to newspapers late on Monday, insisting the whole effort over the last 24 hours had been to keep him in the government.</p> <p>Cairns said yesterday that he had resigned with a heavy heart, and had been in personal turmoil, being the kind of person \"who thought the worst day of a Labour government was better than the best day of a Tory or an SNP administration\". </p> <p>But the former priest and ex-Northern Ireland minister said he had been wrestling with his conscience for months over whether to continue to support Brown. </p> <p>In a letter accepting his resignation, the prime minister praised his work in office, but added that at a time of \"economic upheaval ... I believe it is vital that we as a government, and as a country, stand together in the face of these difficult times and concentrate all our efforts on helping the British people to come through them. </p> <p>\"I am therefore disappointed by your decision to leave the government, and I do not agree with you that this is the time at which the Labour party should be focused on internal debates.\"</p> <p>Brown yesterday won a string of fresh plaudits from cabinet ministers, with the justice secretary, Jack Straw, saying he was \"absolutely clear that Gordon Brown is the man with experience, intellect and strategy to lead us through these economic times\". The health secretary, Alan Johnson, also called for unity. The work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, questioned the judgment of the rebels. </p> <p>At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, reported widespread activist anger at the behaviour of a minority of rebels ahead of Labour's conference. </p> <p>Brown told the meeting that the main task for the conference was to promise to help people through their short-term economic difficulties.</p> <h2>Profile: David Cairns</h2> <p>Former priest David Cairns is respected by colleagues as a skilled political operator. He was given a key role in the Glasgow East byelection, where he had to confront doorstep complaints about the government's performance. Despite the SNP's victory there he was also tipped to take a leading part in Labour's next Scottish byelection battle, in Glenrothes - a contest crucial to Gordon Brown's survival. Cairns is a former researcher for Siobhain McDonagh, sacked last week for calling for a leadership contest. The government reversed a law barring former Catholic priests from entering the Commons on his behalf in 2001, allowing him to become MP for Greenock and Inverclyde.<br><strong>Severin Carrell and Jenny Percival</strong></p>",
  "<p>Forces from Hamas, the Islamist movement in control of Gaza, attacked a compound belonging to a powerful criminal gang yesterday in a heavy street battle that left 11 dead, including a baby boy.</p> <p>The fighting began on Monday when a Hamas policeman was killed with a shot to the head while Hamas forces were trying to arrest a wanted member of the Doghmush clan inside the headquarters of the Gaza municipality. After the shooting, Hamas mounted a major raid on the clan in al-Sabra in eastern Gaza.</p> <p>The attack lasted until dawn yesterday, with heavy fighting in the streets of the city. Another Hamas policeman was killed along with 10 members of the clan, all young men apart from two children, a boy aged one and a 16-year-old, according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. A further 42 people were injured.</p> <p>Hamas said its forces had been involved in an operation against \"fugitives\".</p> <p>It marked one of the heaviest days of fighting in Gaza for several weeks and was part of a long-running attempt by Hamas to challenge some of the powerful gangs in Gaza, of which the Doghmush is perhaps the most dangerous. The clan is believed to have been responsible last year for the kidnap of Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist held in Gaza for nearly four months before being freed unhurt. The Doghmush is also thought to have links to newly emerging Islamist groups in Gaza, including one calling itself the Army of Islam.</p> <p>Some in the Doghmush have been allied to Fatah, the movement led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, while others are close to Hamas and are believed to have taken part in the capture of an Israeli soldier near Gaza two years ago. The soldier, Gilad Shalit, is still being held.</p> <p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights called for an investigation into the incident and said it was investigating reports that after the first Hamas police officer was killed on Monday the original Doghmush suspect, Jameel Doghmush, was taken to the policeman's home and shot dead by several gunmen in an apparent act of revenge.</p> <p>Yesterday's attack follows an incident in early August when 11 people were killed as Hamas confronted another powerful Gaza clan linked to the rival Fatah movement.</p>",
  "<p>Once a large bus station, Moscow's newest and hippest contemporary art space opened to the public yesterday in a blaze of publicity inevitably connected to the gallery's celebrity founder, Daria Dasha Zhukova. </p> <p>Zhukova, 27, is a Russian heiress, socialite, and sometime fashion designer. She is also the girlfriend of Roman Abramovich, billionaire owner of Chelsea FC. The Garage Centre for Contemporary Culture Moscow is her first major public project.</p> <p>The work of New York-based husband-and-wife installation artists Ilya and Emilia Kabakov forms her first exhibition. The Garage will be a major space for established international and Russian artists, as well as emerging ones, Zhukova said. It will also have a library, a bookshop and a cafe. </p> <p>She said: \"I think I have always had an idea to open a contemporary art centre at the back of my mind. It wasn't until I saw this building that I realised this would be the perfect place to realise the idea.\" </p> <p>\"Aesthetically I love this building. It's absolutely beautiful. I love that it's a perfect parallelogram,\" she added.</p> <p>Asked how she had got involved in art, she said: \"I kind of grew up with it. My father is really into architecture. Both of my best friends are artists. I think it's always been around me.\"</p> <p>Fans are likely to praise the gallery as an innovative attempt to bring contemporary international art to Moscow, a city with few public art spaces and a newly emerging art scene. </p> <p>The 8,500 sq metre (two-acre) venue, designed by the avant-garde architect Konstantin Melnikov as a bus depot in 1926, is reminiscent of Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in London. The Garage is in an area next to Moscow's Jewish community centre in leafy northern Moscow.</p> <p>Inside, the building boasts twisting metal pipes and high industrial ceilings. The biggest current exhibit is a railway carriage. You can walk inside to find a colourful mural of a Soviet air balloon. Accordion music plays in the background.</p> <p>Inevitably, critics are likely to dub the Garage an extravagant multimillion-pound vanity project. Several have raised eyebrows at Zhukova's alleged dilettantism, after she admitted she was unable to recall which artists she likes. </p> <p>Zhukova yesterday refused to say how much the Garage had cost, and whether Abramovich (who is worth \u00a313.7bn) had paid for it. He is listed as an exhibition sponsor. The gallery's start-up costs were \"privately funded\", she said, adding: \"I don't talk about Mr Abramovich.\"</p> <p>She told the Guardian: \"I hope everybody comes here. I hope young people come here and old people come here, people who love contemporary art and people who don't like it. </p> <p>\"I just hope to start a dialogue with our audience. I hope to get them excited about all the many different artists that are out there.\" </p> <p>Abramovich's recent interest in art manifested itself in May, when he emerged as the buyer of Lucian Freud's Benefits Supervisor Sleeping (\u00a317m) and Francis Bacon's Triptych (\u00a343m). Neither are on display in the Garage. </p> <p>Last night art historians praised the decision to open a contemporary art gallery in Moscow - and to show a retrospective of the Kabakovs' work. \"They are truly great Russian artists,\" art critic Robert Storr said.</p> <h2>Soviet sketches</h2> <p><strong>Ilya Kabakov</strong>, who works with his curator wife, <strong>Emilia</strong>, is one of Russia's greatest <strong>conceptual</strong> artists. Labelled a <strong>nonconformist</strong> during Soviet times, Kabakov spent 30 years in Moscow, before emigrating to the <strong>US</strong> in the 80s. The Garage exhibition is the first time his large-scale installations have been shown in Russia. Kabakov explores the <strong>lost world</strong> of the Soviet Union through portraits and sketches, which vividly depict an unrealisable <strong>utopian</strong> future. The Kabakovs were awarded the <strong>Praemium Imperiale</strong> yesterday, one of the world's top art prizes.</p>",
  "<p>Jason Holder, assistant director of property services at Homezone Housing in Lichfield, Staffordshire, describes his recent session with a career coach as \"a really good kick up the backside when I needed it the most.\"</p> <p>\"When you're working in housing you have to have the passion and the desire to provide a good service, and I think I had forgotten why I was in housing, what I was trying to achieve,\" he says. \"What coaching did was reinforce my passion and refocus my mind. Just one afternoon with a career coach changed my whole attitude towards the job.\"</p> <p>Ten years ago most housing associations would stress the need for discretion when employing the services of a career coach. For many, bringing in career coaching was seen as a tacit admission that there was something wrong with the way that staff were being managed. Now this is changing. Career coaching is fast becoming an integral part of a housing association's staff development and training.</p> <p>\"Working in housing is a particularly complex and challenging job,\" says <a href=\"http://www.nickcromwellcoaching.co.uk/\">Nick Cromwell</a>, a career coach and leadership training consultant. \"You're working with huge numbers of properties, tenants and employees, quite often managers are having to cope with a wide geographical spread as well as complex funding issues and policy shifts. On top of this the housing sector can't pay as much as the private sector for such a demanding occupation so recruitment and retention has always been an issue. Career coaching can be one way of facing some of these challenges.\"</p> <p>Holder, who has taken part in one-to-one sessions with a career coach as well as attending group sessions run by the professional organisation the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH), says coaching can vastly improve basic management skills. He points to coaching that his association ran recently, that he says was \"incredibly effective bringing people together from across the organisation to work on collective leadership skills\". </p> <p>Coaching is becoming so integrated across the sector that the CIH now offers free coaching development workshops and one-to-one coaching sessions with a trainer as part of membership benefits. </p> <p>Heather Salway, a career trainer at Eden Brown, the coaching organisation used by CIH, says that housing associations can also use coaching to sort out specific knowledge gaps within an organisation. \"I worked with one housing association recently which had just hired its first IT manager,\" she says. \"He came to us and specifically asked us to provide him with some IT coaching, someone to use as a sounding board, to talk through programmes or ideas he wanted to implement and discuss the challenges that he was facing, because he was struggling on his own.\"</p> <p>Cromwell says coaching can also be used to sort out interpersonal relationships between staff and down the chain of command. \"A frequent topic that comes up through career coaching is managing relationships with the board, managing relations with staff below you in the organisational hierarchy,\" says Cromwell. \"Often people come into training asking, 'I need to get my staff to perform better' and through coaching realise that it's often a matter of them sorting out their own approach to the basics of management or even to the job itself.\"</p> <p>When working with someone on a one-to-one level, Cromwell usually makes contact a week or so before to have a general talk through what the coaching will entail. The first meeting is usually a \"scoping session\", where the career coach and housing professional discuss what they would like to achieve and agree on a set of objectives. Typically Cromwell will return to run four or five two-hour sessions over the space of about six months with telephone and email support provided in between.</p> <p><strong>Don't look at the price tag</strong></p> <p>However, the main barrier for housing associations looking to bring in career coaching is still the cost. Coaching can be seen as an expensive intervention for housing associations struggling to make ends meet. The average cost for six coaching sessions for a senior executive still hovers around the \u00a32,100 mark.</p> <p>\"It can be a struggle convincing associations that this cost is justified,\" says Salway. \"But once associations trial coaching they seldom look back. I believe coaching will start to be seen as an essential investment across the sector in the next few years.\"</p> <p>As the demand for career coaching has increased, so has the number of career coaches and coaching organisations offering their services. \"One of the problems is that pretty much anyone can set themselves up as a career coach,\" says Salway. She says housing associations should source career coaches through reputable umbrella organisations, such as the CIH, which will have checked the credentials and experience of the coaches it recommends.</p> <p>\"There are hundreds of career coaches and consultancy firms all over the country, but what we now need is some kind of formal accreditation so housing associations know that if they are making the investment, they are getting what they should be,\" she says. \"Career coaching can be an excellent way of developing and nurturing your staff but only if the coach knows the best way to get the most out of each individual that comes through their door.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Chartered Institute of Housing: <a href=\"http://www.cih.org\">cih.org</a></p> <p>Eden Brown: <a href=\"http://www.edenbrown.com\">edenbrown.com</a></p> <p>Homezone Housing: <a href=\"http://www.homezone.plus.com\">homezone.plus.com</a></p> <h2>What to expect</h2> <p><strong>Nick Cromwell, a career coach and development consultant, says:</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Think about how you will assess the benefits of the coaching. Will the coaching be offered to all staff or will it be targeted at specific people?</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Find out what qualifications, experience and accreditation the coach has. Can they provide testimonials?</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Consider the benefits of coaching in terms of recruitment and staff retention. How does your organisation invest in its people and their career development? </p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Consider whether the coach understands your sector. Although a background in housing is not essential, they should have some experience of the particular challenges faced in housing.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Don't assume all coaches work in the same way - there are a huge range of different styles and approaches so ask yourself what it is you hope to achieve. </p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Coaching should not be used to fix issues that need to be dealt with as an organisation. Coaching should not be used to abdicate responsibility for tackling capability issues.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> Don't offer coaching to staff who are not committed to the process. </p> <p><strong>8.</strong> Don't enter into an agreement without a written contract. Both sides should understand what is expected.</p>",
  "<p>As director of Israeli military intelligence from mid-1950 to early 1955, Binyamin Gibli, who has died aged 89, was a key player in what was arguably his country's most debilitating political scandal, the Lavon affair. He was responsible for initiating an illicit campaign of bombing and sabotage against western targets in Egypt, and, having been forced to resign, he later admitted having forged documents that falsely implicated his boss, the Israeli defence minister Pinhas Lavon, in the plot.</p> <p>The affair had major repercussions on two fronts. In Egypt, it arguably fuelled the 1956 Suez crisis, and hastened the departure from the country of 50,000 Jews, who came to be seen as a fifth column. In Israel, it forced the resignation of Lavon, sparked a crisis in the ruling Labour party involving key figures such as Shimon Peres and Moshe Dayan, emboldened Israel's press and ultimately demolished the career of the former premier David Ben-Gurion. </p> <p>The Lavon affair had its origins in Israeli concerns in the early 1950s that the US was becoming too friendly with Egypt's charismatic young leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, seeing him as a potential bastion against Russia. Having failed to influence US policy through diplomatic means, Gibli and his circle initiated a bombing campaign in Egypt, codenamed Operation Shoshana (Susannah), in the hope that the chaos it wrought would be blamed on local communists or the Muslim Brotherhood threatening counter-revolution. Washington, they reasoned, would then shun Nasser as weak. They also hoped that Britain might shelve plans to shut its military base at Suez, which Israel regarded as a useful defensive bulwark.</p> <p>But Shoshana backfired spectacularly. In early July 1954, homemade bombs were left at a post office in Alexandria, the US Information Agency libraries in Alexandria and Cairo, and a British-owned theatre. But they did little damage and caused no injuries. Then, on July 23, a device being carried to the Rio Cinema in Alexandria exploded in the agent's pocket, and he and 10 other suspects were arrested and put on trial. All the indications suggested that the Egyptian authorities knew in advance what was happening.</p> <p>Two of the accused were hanged: one committed suicide and another died during interrogation. The remaining captives were released only in 1968 in a prisoner exchange following the six-day war, and it was not until 2005 that Israel admitted responsibility for the affair and honoured the Egyptian Jewish agents involved.</p> <p>Gibli resigned in March 1955, two months after his boss Lavon, who had accused him of perjury, forgery, insubordination and criminal negligence. Much later, however, Gibli's former secretary revealed that a document supposedly signed by Lavon and sent by Gibli to Dayan was indeed a forgery. In 1960, Lavon was finally absolved of any involvement in the bombing campaign.</p> <p>Gibli was born in Petah Tikva, near what is now Tel Aviv, four years after his parents arrived in Palestine from Bryansk, in western Russia. A member of the Haganah militia, from 1941 to 1944 he worked for the British Mandate police. In 1948, during the Israeli war of independence, he headed the police intelligence unit in Jerusalem. That summer, he sat on a four-man tribunal that tried and sentenced to death the Haganah commander Meir Tobianski on charges of passing military information to Jordan and Britain. Tobianski, a former officer in the Royal Corps of Engineers and employee of the British-run Jerusalem Electricity Company, was posthumously cleared. The chairman of the court was jailed for manslaughter, but Gibli avoided prosecution.</p> <p>In 1950 he became head of the Israeli military intelligence force, Aman, and promptly ignited a turf war with the Israeli foreign ministry and the intelligence service Mossad by trying to extend Aman's remit to all foreign operations. The following year he set up a network of secret units, including unit 131, with sleeper cells in Alexandria and Cairo, who were later responsible for Shoshana. Avri Elad (formerly Abraham Seidenberg), who took over the running of unit 131 but was later jailed for 10 years for selling secrets to Egypt, insisted at his trial that Gibli, not Lavon, had given the order for action. The signal, he said, was a radio broadcast of an English cake recipe.</p> <p>After his resignation, Gibli remained in the Israel defence forces and commanded the Golani Brigade in Gaza during the 1956 Suez war. He then served as Israeli military attach\u00e9 in Scandinavia and London, where he was in 1960 when news of his forgery broke. He finally admitted the sham and was fired from the military. </p> <p>He later headed a car manufacturer and the Israel Electric Corporation. His brother Avshalom swore that he was always haunted by the Tobianski trial and the Lavon affair. The historian Tom Segev wrote that Gibli belonged to Israel's \"clandestine aristocracy [who treated] the law as an unnecessary encumbrance and preferred to stick to their youthful tricks\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Binyamin Gibli, military intelligence officer, born 1919; died August 20 2008</p>",
  "<p>The US government was on the brink of a deal to take control of the world's largest insurance company, AIG, in a last-ditch intervention to avert a potentially \u00addisastrous corporate collapse. </p> <p>After a day of emergency talks, congressional leaders were briefed last night that the Federal Reserve had agreed in principle to lend $85bn to AIG in return for an 80% stake in the struggling company. </p> <p>The arrangement was sure to prove contentious because it renders AIG's shares virtually worthless. The Bush administration is likely to face tough questions about why it is willing to rescue AIG while \u00adallowing Lehman Brothers to go bust. </p> <p>AIG employs 106,000 people in 130 countries and sells 12m policies annually in Britain, including travel insurance and product protection under retailers' own brands such as Boots, Argos, Comet and Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The firm, which is shirt sponsor of \u00adManchester United FC has amassed huge liabilities by insuring financial investors against the risk of default on complex instruments including derivatives linked to subprime mortgages. </p> <p>Policyholders, politicians and business leaders urged the Bush administration to find a way to keep AIG afloat, warning that bankruptcy would have a knock-on effect on customers around the globe. </p> <p>Calling for decisive action, AIG's former chief executive Hank Greenberg, who ran the company from 1967 to 2005, warned that it would be a \"dramatic mistake\" to allow the company to go under. Describing AIG as a \"national treasure\", Greenberg said the company merely needed a bridging loan giving it time to sell some of its sprawling collection of insurance businesses in order to bolster its finances. </p> <p>\"Given some time, they could raise more funds and sell assets,\" Greenberg told CNBC television. \"That would be in our national interests, let alone the interests of the 100,000 people who work at AIG.\" The billionaire 83-year-old insurance tycoon continued: \"If you can't raise it any other way in the private sector, the Fed should make a loan. It's not a gift, not a bailout, because it's a solvent company.\" </p> <p>New York's Democratic senator, Charles Schumer, said the AIG bailout approached the scope of the Fed's rescue of the \u00admortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac earlier this month. Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, told Bloomberg Television that the plan was likely to go ahead without special legislation. </p> <p>The crisis was triggered on Monday evening when rating agencies including Standard &amp; Poor's, Fitch and Moody's downgraded their view of AIG's credit worthiness. As well as undermining \u00adconfidence in AIG's insurance policies, this move triggered contractual clauses requiring the company to come up with nearly $15bn in extra collateral to satisfy clients and trading partners. </p> <p>There were signs that confidence in was AIG beginning to break down. In Singapore, hundreds of anxious investors besieged an AIG office seeking cash redemption of their policies.</p> <p>In the US, brokers said they were getting calls from clients questioning whether they should cash in annuities and similar products. </p> <p>The governor of AIG's home state of New York, David Paterson, has granted the company an exemption from insurance regulations to allow it to raid its \u00adsubsidiaries' reserves for $20bn. He warned that a collapse of AIG would hurt businesses in every corner of the globe. </p> <p>\"This is a catastrophic problem waiting if we are unable to curtail it,\" said Paterson. \"We're in a terrible situation if we let the world's largest industrial and commercial insurer go down.\" </p>",

  "<p>Northampton believe the Guinness Premiership salary cap of \u00a34m a year is unlikely to survive after the end of next season as teams seek to rival French clubs, some of whom are spending three times that amount on their squads.</p> <p>The Saints' chief executive, Allan Robson, said: \"I believe it is inevitable the cap will go. We have agreed that there will be no change this season or next but expenditure is growing and we are competing with overseas sides. Northampton and Leicester are two big clubs in terms of finance and structure, but if you look at the budgets of big French clubs, it is nothing. Competitive balance on the pitch is important to our domestic game, but I am raising the issue about competition outside that which demands higher budgets.\"</p> <p>Mark McCafferty, the chief executive of Premier Rugby, said a review of the cap would be conducted at the beginning of next season. \"The most important thing for us as an organisation is that the Premiership remains an unpredictable tournament,\" he said. \"We do not want the same sides finishing in the top four every year. We are competitive in Europe, as we have shown in recent years. If that changed, we would have to rethink the cap.\"</p> <p>The cap rose significantly in the summer and not every club is spending \u00a34m on wages. \"We are currently awaiting figures, but I think most sides will be spending close to the limit,\" said McCafferty. \"As resources develop, the cap will rise; equally, if they decline, it will decrease.\"</p> <p>Premier Rugby and the Rugby Football Union have joined forces to analyse the impact of the experimental law variations before a vote is taken by the International Rugby Board next March to make them permanent. \"We want objective evidence to base a decision on,\" McCafferty said.</p>",
  "<p>Chelsea have taken the first step towards exorcising painful memories of Moscow though, in rampant victory, it was the perfectionist in Luiz Felipe Scolari that surfaced. Even this stroll did not induce any sense of satisfaction. \"There were too many mistakes and we didn't play very well,\" grumbled the Brazilian. Europe take note: this team's best has yet to come.</p> <p>Bordeaux departed for France thankful that they had been spared the thrashing their abject display deserved. Had Chelsea been slicker, or at least cut out the occasional bouts of sloppiness that surrendered possession too readily after the interval, then they might have rattled up a cricket score. As it was, the hosts curtailed the show-boating and found their range twice in the last eight minutes to give the scoreline a more appropriate feel.</p> <p>Scolari said he was \"pleased\" with his players afterwardsand will give them today off but his dissatisfaction had been expressed in the dressing room after the final whistle. \"Look, it is an important win and it means we have started well, but we know we didn't play well,\" he said. \"We made far too many mistakes when we had the ball. When you're 2-0 up at half-time in the Champions League, you have to work harder. You need to control the game more. But we didn't control it very well in the second half.</p> <p>\"The players wanted to make more goals but, if you are sloppy, you give your opponents opportunities. I know Bordeaux only had two shots, but they had more time with the ball than us. We have the experience to know better. Against a better team, we might have been punished. Other teams might have attacked us quicker and hurt us. If they'd had more quality, it would have been dangerous for us.\"</p> <p>As it was, Roman Abramovich strode around the pitch an hour after the final whistle content that the first step has been taken towards Rome and redemption. A year ago, the Chelsea owner had left this arena after the first group game, an embarrassing draw with Rosenborg salvaged by Andriy Shevchenko, contemplating the imminent sacking of Jose Mourinho. Scolari, content or not, can rest easy that there will be no repeat.</p> <p>Possession may have been frittered away too easily, but there were aspects to please the hosts. Florent Malouda was a constant menace down the Chelsea left, revelling re-establishing his reputation against his compatriots, while Jose Bosingwa had the freedom of the right.</p> <p>The woodwork quivered twice in the latter stages and there was an 18th European goal from Frank Lampard to savour, hoisting the midfielder up alongside Didier Drogba as the club's most prolific in continental competition.</p> <p>\"We wanted to start well - we didn't last year and it made it more difficult for us,\" said Lampard. \"The start of the second half was not so good but we came through well. I'm playing well and scoring goals and I'm part of a good team. It's enjoyable playing in this team.\"</p> <p>Rather that than labouring against them. This was a first Champions League game for Laurent Blanc, and further evidence that the usual suspects - certainly the English clubs - should negotiate safe passage into the knock-out phase of the competition. \"We should have given a better account of ourselves,\" said the former Manchester United defender. \"We showed them too much respect and were too timid.</p> <p>\"Given the height we've got in our team, we shouldn't be conceding headed goals to Joe Cole, who's hardly the tallest player on the pitch. I felt a little bit let down. We were too mediocre, our mental approach was all wrong. There was no aggression to our play and we lost individual battles all over the pitch.\"</p> <p>Blanc will have been dismayed byCFR Cluj's victory over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico, a result which appears to jeopardise Les Girondins' chances of even finishing as group runners-up. For Chelsea, the focus remains entirely on improvement.</p>",

They are not just good at shedding risk - they shed blame.</p> <p>We are seeing what historians of ideas call a paradigm shift. In the last century, the necessities of war and the rise of socialism thrust government intervention to the fore. When that failed in the 60s and 70s, the \"Reagan-Thatcher revolution\" turned the emphasis back to private enterprise and deregulation. That era has ended with astonishing abruptness. Governments in Britain and the US have been nationalising and spending public money with a will that would have made Attlee or Roosevelt blush.</p> <p>Those of us who learned economics in the old days were taught that banks had to be regulated oligopolies because their role in a capitalist economy was crucial. It relied on the sustenance of public trust which only government, backed by the citizen as taxpayer, could dispense. In Britain, retail banks, merchant banks and building societies were legally distinct, separated by barriers to prevent cross-pollution of the sort that caused the 1929 crash.</p> <p>JK Galbraith's book on that crash is the Dr Strangelove of financial holocaust. If it offers one lesson, it is that crashes are not acts of God; they are caused by the interaction of corporate behaviour and state regulation. Nor does the market supply its own discipline. Understanding that, wrote Galbraith, \"remains our best safeguard against recurrence\".</p> <p>Such lessons learned in youth tend to stick. Hence I remember feeling queasy when Thatcher's \"big bang\" of 1986 demolished the firewalls and permitted the trading of risk and reward across the entire financial sector. It was a reform repeated in the US with the repeal of the post-depression Glass-Steagall law. The same nervousness greeted each subsequent shock to the system - the 1991 housing crash, Lloyd's of London, Barings, Enron, Northern Rock. Each time we were assured that new lessons had been learned. Light-touch regulation was working fine, even if sometimes boys will be boys.</p> <p>The naivety of all this is now exposed. Politicians encouraged the public to treat home ownership as a \"right\"; property became the citizen's gilt-edged stock. Bankers encouraged staff to speculate with depositors' money by awarding them huge bonuses to maintain turnover. Those charged with the guardianship of other people's savings behaved, in effect, like thieves. Sheer greed drove young men and women mad. Nobody in authority batted an eyelid.</p> <p>At the same time Gordon Brown \"set free\" the Bank of England to fix interest rates. I recall one commentator telling me that I should be \"overjoyed your children and grandchildren will now never have to experience inflation\". No, they are just unemployed. It was a charade. On the back of low inflation, the Bank fuelled a credit boom that was clearly vulnerable if prices rose and/or credit collapsed. Both have occurred.</p> <p>There is no such thing as a \"non-political\" official rate of interest. The Bank is now under pressure both to cut rates to beat recession, and yet raise them to beat inflation. It cannot do both. Since it would be 1929-style lunacy to increase rates just now, Brown must in effect tell the Bank to reduce them by shifting his inflation target. It is a blatant and properly political decision.</p> <p>There is no perfect market. Markets need regulation, just as communities need law. Yet as Galbraith again wrote, regulators may start life \"vigorous, aggressive, evangelical, even intolerant\", but mellow with age and become \"an arm of the industry they are regulating - or senile\".</p> <p>To ignore the danger in 125% mortgages or the City bonus culture showed both industry capture and senility. The first was loan-sharkery, and the second was obscene. So distorting to sound finance are year-end bonuses that they should simply be banned. Those with the responsibility of gambling with other people's savings should do so on salary.</p> <p>While naive Thatcherism may have taken a pasting, there is no reason why capitalism should protest the presence of big government in what is its proper realm. We do not curb state power when the security of the state is at risk. Nor should we do so when the security of the economy is equally jeopardised.</p> <p>The strangest phenomenon these past few days has been the eagerness to enforce \"moral hazard\", a concept regarded by the governor of the Bank of England as a deterrent to risk-taking. This is absurd. The collapse of Enron was no deterrent to Lehman derivative traders. The psychology of money does not work that way. The victims of the credit crunch are not just a few wild traders. They are all participants in the UK economy. I cannot see the sense in letting Northern Rock or Lehman or any other deposit-holding institution go bust just so regulators who have failed in their jobs can seem macho after the event.</p> <p>This is not a question of blowing taxpayers' money on fat cat financiers. I would happily arrest and try all those whose stupidity and greed are about to cause untold hardship to millions - if I could find a law they had broken. Dr Johnson was quite wrong to say a man is \"never more innocently employed than in getting money\". But when a building collapses, you do not kill the architect. You try to get him to build it again.</p> <p>Underpinning financial credit is an absolute function of government and one that has not changed since the birth of capital. It clearly needs constant redefinition. When this saga is through there should be a tribunal of inquiry. Then we can be told what needs mending, and whom to take out and shoot.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The objective of the new version of Sarah's Law is praiseworthy. A pilot scheme in four counties, started this week, would give parents the right to ask the police whether or not a named person who has contact with their children is a known sex offender.</p> <p>Much of the publicity concentrated on single mothers checking on a new man they wished to take into their life, but the scheme goes far wider. It could apply, for instance, to babysitters, an uncle who takes his niece to a pantomime, a sportsman down the road who teaches a boy how to play cricket, even the house painter who might occasionally find himself alone in the house with one of the children.</p> <p>It is, in principle, a good thing that parents can be warned against paedophiles who have access to their children. But I am not satisfied that the scheme being piloted is the way to do it. Parents given the information they ask for will be under a strict obligation of confidence. They are to tell no one else. But is that humanly possible?</p> <p>Can a mother, told that her new boyfriend is a risk to her eight-year-old, keep it a permanent secret from those close to her? Are parents who learn that their daughter's piano teacher has a dodgy sexual past capable of restraining themselves from warning other parents about him?</p> <p>We are told that breaching the confidence may result in court action, even a criminal prosecution if revealing the information leads to public unrest and vigilante action. So a mother tells only her closest friend, but soon the whole neighbourhood knows and a bunch of outraged locals throw a brick at the sex offender's windows. The mother is prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned. A likely scenario? Of course not. There can be no realistic, effective enforcement of the secrecy imposed on parents.</p> <p>But there may be another consequence of the Sarah's Law approach - the possibility that a paedophile in danger of his identity and whereabouts being revealed may choose to hide elsewhere, out of reach of the police. That outcome is the very reason why this country, rightly, refused to copy the US Megan's Law, which has had the proven effect of driving serious sex offenders underground.</p> <p>In the US, the authorities are able to keep track of only 80% of convicted paedophiles. In England the police know where 90% of them are. Do we want to go down the American path? Which country puts children more at risk? The safety of children is paramount and we must be very careful not to prejudice it with a scheme, however well meant, which might have the opposite result to that sincerely intended.</p> <p>There is another more subtle and insidious reason for having reservations about the scheme. It can only increase the already unhealthy obsession that this country is developing about the alleged, though in reality much exaggerated, threat to our children from paedophiles.</p> <p>Only a few days ago, it was reported that adults who went for a walk in their local park were being cross-examined by park officials as to their motives - they were not accompanied by any children, so they must, according to the warped philosophy of our times, be suspected of being there for a more sinister reason.</p> <p>There are many other examples of similar absurdities. The law requiring criminal-records checks on adults who voluntarily helped out with children's activities has brought its own long list of ridiculous consequences; but the sad overall result has been a decline in adults volunteering, and not because they're all paedophiles evading scrutiny.</p> <p>Who suffers? Children, of course, deprived of sporting and fun activities, and especially children from low-income homes.</p> <p>The Sarah's Law scheme will spread suspicion and hurt among neighbours and friends; it will encourage women to regard men as potential paedophiles unless proved otherwise. No longer will the man next door offer to look after the kids for a couple of hours if mum has to go out, knowing or suspecting that she has been to get him vetted. And what kind of a start to a relationship is it when it begins with a visit to the police? \"Yes darling I love you and I trust you, but will you just wait a while, I've got to do a bit of checking.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Barack Obama's problem with Sarah Palin is easy to remedy, in just two moves. It's obvious that John McCain's surge in popularity is a result of a large number of women who would have supported Hillary Clinton turning to Palin. </p> <p>Obama must now wish he had chosen Clinton as his running mate (a wish no doubt enhanced when Joe Biden was stupid enough to proclaim that Clinton might have been a better choice than him). Indeed, had Obama picked her, McCain would probably not have been driven to search for the Nana Mouskouri lookalike.</p> <p>It is clear that Obama needs Clinton. And he can get her. All it needs is for Joe Biden to \"discover\" that he has a dicky heart. He's not obliged to have a full-scale heart attack (though it would help, publicity wise), just be told that there's a weakness, nothing life-threatening, but serious enough to preclude him from taking on a job, even one as undemanding as vice-president of his country.</p> <p>With Biden out of the way, Obama would be free to choose Clinton, and the women who deserted the Democrat cause will come pouring back. There is still time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Marcel saw Fragments at the Young Vic theatre in London: \"They last only 55 minutes in total, but these five mini-dramas were written by Samuel Beckett and directed by Peter Brook, so every minute was mesmerising.\" He saw The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes: \"Lovely frocks, women, crockery, hats, scenery and dogs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ordinary traders were once again talking of meltdown, as yesterday brought a fresh slide in London shares and fears of a crisis at the mortgage lending giant HBOS. But the more thoughtful among them were talking instead about a Minsky moment. The economist Hyman Minsky said instability was not an aberration in finance, but its core. Finance is the bloodstream of the economy, and any poison entering it soon pollutes the whole system. These twin features - unusual volatility and high contagion - mean banks need superintending more closely than widget manufacturers.</p> <p>Even after all the concerted intervention yesterday of central banks across the globe to steady nerves in financial markets and pump money into the system, the greatest single danger remains that the authorities will be too passive. Indeed the US central bank disappointed investors and financiers last night by holding its key interest at 2%. Amid all this, the government risks being a bystander. The Scotland Office minister David Cairns stepped forward as the latest Labour rebel yesterday; more serious, perhaps, is the Bank of England's semi-detached attitude. In a public letter yesterday, its governor, Mervyn King, had to explain why inflation had risen to 4.7% in August. Amid four pages surveying commodity prices and the theoretical danger of embedding inflationary expectations, there was a one-line reference to the current mayhem on the global money markets. That was enough to stoke expectations of a modest rate cut before too long, but hardly suggests the Bank is seized by the need to avoid a wholesale slump. Since the market turmoil began last summer, the Federal Reserve has cut rates dramatically, which has suited Wall Street well; but when it comes to wider action the US authorities still give the impression of wanting to tread carefully back towards business as usual.</p> <p>But business as usual is, of course, what got us into this mess in the first place. If financiers are to enjoy bail-outs then they must also mend their ways. The current order was defined by the banker-knows-best ideology. For the last two decades this approach suited not just the money men themselves but also politicians chasing quick growth - and for that matter individuals wanting cheap loans. Assets were repackaged into new-fangled shapes, and spun candyfloss style into a great cone of debt. The realisation that this was largely whipped out of thin air is what is now causing the chaos. Watching trading-floor panic and flashing red screens, the public looks on with anxious bafflement - hoping that someone will do something soon to get things under control. If confidence is not somehow restored, the reign of pessimism could prove absolute. As households cut spending, it would not just be the City but the whole economy that would be dragged into the mire. Speaking after an earlier financial crisis had been allowed to play out in this way, Franklin Roosevelt explained to the American people that the only thing to fear was fear itself. He started to lift spirits when he promised \"action and action now\".</p> <p>The restoration of the kind of safeguards installed at that time is one important step. A US firewall between retail and investment banks, for instance, was installed in the 1930s but demolished in recent years. As investment banks crumble, it is plain that the system needs such protection again. There is also need for a total overhaul of the way financial products are governed. Purveyors of the complex bets known as credit derivatives can do what they like until regulators ask them to stop. It is time to shift to a precautionary principle so that new financial products are licensed only when they have been shown to be safe. Drugs have long been subject to licensing, and so too should derivatives. Of course this will constrain financial creativity. But events are fast showing that creating a global market in debt also has vicious side-effects.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's new prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, yesterday described Robert Mugabe as \"giving up\" and said that he would seek to govern by sidelining the beleaguered president whose own party is \"moving on\" without him.</p> <p>But, in an interview with the Guardian, Tsvangirai acknowledged that a climate of suspicion and mistrust between his own Movement for Democratic Change and Mugabe's Zanu-PF party would test his political skills as prime minister at the head of a coalition government of former opponents - some of whom are responsible for overseeing a vicious campaign of violence against other members of the new administration. </p> <p>That suspicion will not be eased by a warning from Tsvangirai that while Mugabe is unlikely to be called to account for his crimes, others in the Zanu-PF leadership - including some who may sit in the new cabinet - could face trial. </p> <p>\"I don't think Mugabe himself as a person can be held accountable. But there are various levels of institutional violence that has taken place and I'm sure we'll be able to look at that,\" he said. \"Let the rule of law apply ... We all cry for the rule of law, and if somebody's committed an offence he should be prosecuted.\"</p> <p>Under the power-sharing deal signed on Monday, Tsvangirai will head a council of ministers responsible for the day-to-day running of the country, while Mugabe will chair a cabinet of the same ministers to agree policy. The two factions of the MDC combined have a majority of one in both bodies. </p> <p>Tsvangirai acknowledged that working in the cabinet would be testing.</p> <p>\"There's an inherent suspicion, there's inherent mistrust of Robert Mugabe. It's understandable given his history, given his role. It's part of his legacy. But he also must understand that the future is not in the hands of Robert Mugabe. The future is in the hands of those who are advocating a change of direction because that is what is going to rescue this country. And I think he appreciates that,\" he said.</p> <p>Tsvangirai believes that heading the council of ministers, without Mugabe present, will allow him to sideline the president and govern directly by establishing a working relationship with Zanu-PF cabinet ministers who realise that Mugabe is part of the past. \"That's the whole purpose of having a council of ministers, that we are able to build a structured relationship outside the cabinet.\"</p> <p>But how is he going to control the council of ministers, many of whom have expressed contempt for him, or worse?</p> <p>\"It has to be a combination of personal cultivation of the team and to remove these negative attitudes. I'm sure we don't all have to agree. We will disagree. But at the end of the day we have to be motivated by what is the best interests of the country. I'll try to encourage that,\" he said. </p> <p>He acknowledged that some of Mugabe's ministers would seek to sabotage his leadership. \"Those will be sour grapes and I'm sure that anyone who engages in those kind of negative tendencies is holding the country to ransom. For what purpose?\"</p> <p>Mugabe's speech after the signing of the accord on Monday was not a good omen. The president dwelled on the past and gave only a belated and half-hearted commitment to make the power-sharing agreement work.</p> <p>\"That was vintage Mugabe at his best: unrepentant, defiant, even when he was giving up,\" said Tsvangirai. </p> <p>But he insisted that the future lay beyond Mugabe and that even his Zanu-PF party was moving beyond him. \"They see this old man who is defiant right up to the end. But he was also able to give the country a chance to rescue itself from the malaise and start over again.\"</p> <p>Many in the MDC are suspicious of compromise. They want to force out men such as the police chief, Augustine Chihuri, who said he would never salute Tsvangirai and who used his force as part of the assault on the MDC during the election. </p> <p>Tsvangirai sees it differently. \"Chihuri is just an individual. We're not talking about individuals here. We're talking about a process ... in which individuals have to fit a transformative agenda or find themselves not fitting with the spirit of the new agenda.\" Or as another senior MDC official put it: \"They have to salute us or leave.\"</p> <p>Tsvangirai referred back to the compromises at the end of white rule 28 years ago. \"We had a similar kind of people in 1980, those who refused to accept black majority rule has arrived and were even undermining the government, even going to the extent of sabotaging the government. In the process of change of this nature that is expected, but it does not stop a train moving forward,\" he said. </p> <p>But to move the train forward, Tsvangirai needs foreign money to rebuild an economy shattered by hyperinflation, plunder of the central bank, and a collapse in agriculture and manufacturing. The Europeans and Americans have earmarked about \u00a31bn in help but first they want to see that Tsvangirai really is in charge and that Mugabe really is giving up. </p> <p>\"They are sceptical because they mistrust Mugabe but they are also aware of their obligations,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I hope that they would look at this [agreement] as a positive step that should be supported ... because they were supporting the democratic struggle in the country.\" </p> <p>That struggle began in earnest eight years ago as the government seized white-owned farms in the name of righting a historical wrong. The process was so corrupt and botched that agriculture has collapsed as a result. </p> <p>But on this issue, Tsvangirai now agrees with Mugabe. The land will never go back to the white farmers. </p> <p>\"Don't underestimate the political and economic consequences of land but we want to solve this once and for all so that never again should land be used as a political tool,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We don't have any intention of going back to pre-2000.\"</p> <h2>Donors cautious about aid</h2> <p>Western donors remain cautious about the political settlement in Zimbabwe and want to see further progress before unlocking a \u00a31bn aid package. </p> <p>The US ambassador to Harare, James McGee, told the Associated Press that Washington was adopting a \"very careful wait-and-see stance\". \"If this works out the way Mr Tsvangirai hopes it will, we will be very willing to work with the people of Zimbabwe,\" he said.</p> <p>But while large amounts of financial aid will not be forthcoming until the US sees evidence that it is Morgan Tsvangirai and not Robert Mugabe who is in charge, McGee said the US would provide food to alleviate widespread malnutrition. </p> <p>EU foreign ministers said the government had to prove itself democratically before economic aid was resumed. They said the EU was prepared to \"adopt a set of economic support measures\" but only in support of \"a transitional government taking the steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe\".</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who chaired EU talks on sanctions, said: \"We are happy about what is happening there but it's not the end. It will be a long process.\"</p> <p>Australia's foreign minister, Stephen Smith, described the political settlement as \"modest progress\" and said sanctions against Mugabe and other Zanu-PF leaders would not be lifted until there was evidence of progress on human rights and economic reconstruction.</p>",
  "<p>Tougher restrictions on the use of a chemical used to line food and drink cans and found in baby bottles and other plastic containers will be demanded today, following publication of research linking it to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and liver abnormalities in adults.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners have long worried over the ubiquitous presence of bisphenol A, which 90% of people have at low levels in their bodies. Evidence from animal studies shows it is an endocrine disrupter, which can mimic the naturally occurring hormone oestrogen. Critics say it could potentially interfere with the development of a foetus.</p> <p>Until now, there has been more speculation than evidence about its effects on humans. Today, however, research by scientists at Exeter University, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama), finds that adults with higher levels of bisphenol A in their bodies have higher rates of certain diseases. </p> <p>The study will step up pressure on regulatory bodies to control use of the chemical. Two leading US scientists are calling in the same issue of Jama for \"aggressive action\" to limit human exposure, and accuse drug regulators in the US and Europe of turning a blind eye to warning signs in animal studies. The results of the trial will today be put before a committee of the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is considering what action, if any, needs to be taken.</p> <p>The research was based on data from the US, collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-04, which included 1,455 adults over 18 and under 74. The concentration of bisphenol A in the body was measured through a urine sample.</p> <p>The scientists found that people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes had higher concentrations of bisphenol A in their urine, even when age and sex was taken into consideration. Those with the highest concentrations of the chemical in their bodies had nearly three times the likelihood of heart disease of those with the least bisphenol A in their urine, and 2.4 times the diabetes risk. People with high levels of the chemical also had a higher chance of abnormal levels of three liver enzymes.</p> <p>The scientists say their study shows a relationship, but does not prove that bisphenol A (BPA) is responsible for the higher disease levels. They are calling for more studies to be done to confirm what they have found.</p> <p>Iain Lang, of the epidemiology and public health group of Exeter's Peninsula medical school, said the study was not a reason for people to stop buying canned food or plastic bottles. \"I'm not changing my behaviour on the basis of this single study,\" he said. </p> <p>Unhealthy habits, such as eating the wrong foods, smoking, drinking to excess and lack of exercise were the main causes of heart disease, he said. However, regulators will want to reassure themselves that there is no problem and the FDA and European regulators will be under pressure to act. In an editorial in the journal, Frederick vom Saal, from the University of Missouri, Columbia, and John Peterson Myers of Environmental Health Sciences, Charlottesville, Virginia, say the regulators should \"follow the recent action taken by Canadian regulatory agencies, which have declared BPA a 'toxic chemical' requiring aggressive action to limit human and environmental exposures\".</p> <p>Until now, they say, the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority have chosen to ignore warnings in spite of \"overwhelming evidence of harm from animal studies\". A contributory factor may be \"an aggressive disinformation campaign using techniques first developed by the lead, vinyl and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists\".</p> <p>David Coggon, professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southampton, said if the findings were corroborated, there would need to be more controls on exposure to the chemical. \"If low-level BPA were confirmed to cause disease, there would be a need to review controls on sources of exposure to the chemical.\"</p> <p>Professor Richard Sharpe, of the Medical Research Council human reproductive sciences unit at Edinburgh University, said it was important to exclude possible alternative causes of the raised heart disease and diabetes levels. </p> <p>\"If you drink lots of high-sugar canned drinks you will over time increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes ... incidentally you will be exposed to more bisphenol A [from the can lining] ... it is obviously a priority that we design studies to provide this information before we label bisphenol A as the prime suspect,\" he said.</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p>Bisphenol A is mainly used to make a clear plastic polycarbonate which will withstand high temperatures, and epoxy resins to line the insides of tin and aluminium cans to prevent corrosion from the food and drinks they contain.</p> <p>Some of the products which might contain bisphenol A include:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hard clear plastic - and sometimes tinted - water bottles.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hard clear plastic baby feeding bottles.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hard plastic baby toys.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Food storage containers, plastic bowls and tableware.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cans of baked beans, soup, vegetables, fizzy drinks, etc.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dental sealant to prevent cavities.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Electronic equipment.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Spray-on flame retardants.</p>",
  "<p>Last year, according to social housing regulator the Housing Corporation, there were 47 associations consolidating through merger or other means, compared with just 28 in 2002. Most of these were marriages for money although, like marriage, merging is more complex than simply saying \"I do\". The corporation insists that associations become more efficient, giving most of its development cash to a small number of big players, leading associations to jointly bid for the money. </p> <p>There are several structures to seal a union. Associations amalgamate by forming a merged body, or undertake a transfer of engagements, where one is subsumed by the other. Both throw up human resources and employment law problems. The amalgamations model was produced partly so associations could avoid the multi-million pound pension liabilities associated with a transfer of engagements. But under both arrangements, staff may need to transfer to the new organisation using Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations.</p> <p>Equal pay legislation can be an issue. Merging organisations can leave staff of the new body having different terms and conditions for the same work. This could lead to bad feeling and legal claims if there are not sound reasons for the differences. Some organisations choose to harmonise pay and benefits across the merged organisation. \"It is usually time for a review of benefits anyway within a couple of years of a merger,\" says Emma Burrows, partner at law firm Trowers and Hamlins. \"But you cannot change terms if it is related to a transfer; the usual approach is not to harmonise until there is a good business reason to do so.\"</p> <p><strong>Losing senior staff</strong></p> <p>Merging often means getting rid of some senior staff. In the past some have had large pay-offs, but the corporation can frown on this, says Burrows. Corporation guidance limits severance payments to up to a year's gross remuneration in addition to contractual payments for staff with 10 years service. The corporation does not expect staff to be paid the maximum under the guidance however, so associations may have to deal with disappointment from those expecting to be paid more.</p> <p>Getting the right person into the top job is key, adds Burrows. The chair is often from one of the merging associations and chief executive from the other. There may also be board changes with some merged bodies opting to have three members from one organisation, three from another and two new members in order to maintain continuity of governance.</p> <p>To avoid such problems, some associations use new structures that do not change the constitution of their organisations.</p> <p>The Guinness Trust has formed a partnership with 17 associations that developed over a number of years but took off when Northern Counties joined in April 2007. Legally all the companies are independent but work together by signing agreements to provide services for each other. The partnership has some teams within organisations providing services to others in the group and \"virtual teams\" consisting of staff from several of the organisations. Virtual teams would be run by a line manager from one of the organisations day-to-day but it could be difficult legally for the line manager to discipline a team member from a different organisation. So if team members need to be disciplined then there is an agreement enabling the line manager to do so or giving the responsibility to a manager in the organisation that employs the team member. \"Day-to-day it is not a problem it is only in exceptional cases when dealing with difficult situations we have to check we are following our policies and the right person it empowered to do it,\" says Penny Hayes, corporate services director at Guinness Trust. </p> <p>The advantage of the partnership over merger is there is no problem with equal pay or pension legislation and no claim for stamp duty as there could be in a group structure if the ownership of the homes changed, adds Hayes. But she warns of big structural changes: \"You can get into a muddle if you have not thought through the human resources implications.\" </p> <p><strong>Weblinks</strong></p> <p>Housing Corporation: <a href=\"http://www.housingcorp.gov.uk\">housingcorp.gov.uk</a></p> <p>Guinness Trust partnership: <a href=\"http://www.guinnesspartnership.com\">guinnesspartnership.com</a></p>",

Darling said yesterday that the government was concerned about the short-selling of sound financial institutions and the Treasury said last night the chancellor was consulting on ways to toughen up the FSA's policing of the practice.</p> <p>In the US last night, America's central bank, the Federal Reserve, left interest rates on hold at 2%, prompting boos on the floor of the New York stock exchange. However, the Dow Jones industrial average was later up more than 100 points.</p> <p>On Wall Street , AIG's share price fell 40% in after-hours trading. After a day of emergency talks, congressional leaders were briefed that the Federal Reserve had agreed in principle to lend $85bn to AIG in return for an 80% stake. The arrangement is highly contentious because it renders AIG's shares virtually worthless. The administration will also face tough questions about why it is willing to rescue AIG but allow Lehman to go bust.</p> <p>Earlier, the Fed said in a statement: \"Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labour markets have weakened further.\" It added, however, that it was as concerned about inflation as it was about growth.</p> <p>Asian and European stockmarkets fell heavily after Monday's 500-point drop in the Dow Jones. Tokyo's Nikkei index was down 5%, while London's FTSE 100 slipped 178.6 points to a three-year low.</p> <p>Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said the turmoil in the markets had put back recovery by a year. \"It has turned into a much bigger, more widespread and more threatening situation, \" Gurria told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"Recovery was going to be the end of 2008 but that has now gone. It will now be a year from now.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the chair of Greater Manchester's passenger transport authority was ousted by a little-known \"community action party\" in local elections last May, allegations of underhand tactics were unusually strong.</p> <p>Against such an anti-Labour tide - the party lost 1,019 councillors across England that day - Roger Jones might anyway have lost the seat in Salford he had held for 25 years. But some observers feel his fate may have been sealed by the intervention of one of the largest businesses in the north-west, Peel Holdings, which owns, among other things, an edge-of-town shopping complex called the Trafford Centre - with 10,000 free car parking spaces. </p> <p>They believe Jones may have been targeted because he was the public face of an ambitious peak-hour congestion charge scheme - less restrictive than the London model - planned as an integral part of a \u00a33bn programme to improve public transport, and recently approved by the government. The aim is to double the size of the conurbation's super-tram system, known as Metrolink, while creating new bus networks and a \"smart card\", Oyster-style system that would allow commuters to travel seamlessly between tram, bus and commuter rail services.</p> <p>With accusations flying thick and fast, councils at loggerheads, and Labour divided, the manner of Jones's departure is just one of the questions being raised as campaigning for a congestion charge referendum in Greater Manchester, by all-postal ballot, begins in earnest. Counting begins after December 11. To take the heat out of the debate, councils have agreed that voters in at least seven out of the conurbation's 10 boroughs must support the congestion charge, rather than a simple majority across an area of almost 2.5 million people.</p> <p>Supporters say it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to approve what amounts to the biggest single investment in public transport outside London. The government insists that its \u00a31.5bn contribution, tied with permission to borrow the remaining costs, must go hand in glove with a congestion charge - but crucially, this will not kickin until 80% of public transport improvements have been completed - by 2013 at the earliest. </p> <p>The scheme is planned around an outer zone - inside the M60 orbital - which includes the Trafford Centre, and an inner zone. Operating in an inbound direction between 7am and 9.30am - and outbound between 4pm and 6.30pm - it will cost \u00a32 in the morning to cross the outer ring and a further \u00a31 to get into the inner core. Outbound, motorists will pay \u00a31 to cross the inner core with a further \u00a31 for the outer.</p> <p><strong>Businesses divided</strong></p> <p>But the business lobby is divided, while several Labour figures - including former Manchester city council leader Graham Stringer, MP for Manchester Blackley - are opposed because they believe that the charge will play badly for their party in the run-up to the next general election. </p> <p>With Department for Transport figures showing that average speeds on the major roads around Manchester are the slowest in the country - just 13mph - the business-led Greater Manchester Yes Coalition launched its campaign last weekend with a pledge to \"challenge the myths\" surrounding the charge. \"The strength of our campaign is that we are a broad coalition genuinely reflecting the diversity of Greater Manchester,\" declared its chair, Chris Oglesby, chief executive of the property group Bruntwood. \"We are finding that the tide is turning.\"</p> <p>That might appear an admission that the Yes campaign faces an uphill struggle against an opposition that will argue, among other things, that the charge represents another tax on the hard-pressed motorist at a time of high fuel costs. That is certainly the view of Susan Williams, leader of Conservative-controlled Trafford council, which is at loggerheads with Labour-run Manchester. \"To tax people in this economic climate, when the economy is really slowing down, does not seem the thing to do,\" says Williams. Arguing that business will be badly hit, she accuses the government of \"blackmailing\" the conurbation by insisting congestion charging must follow transport improvements.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, she is backing the No campaign led by the Greater Manchester Momentum Group (GMMG) and chaired by Peel Holdings managing director Andrew Simpson. But the campaign's spokesperson, Rachel Wood, denies that Peel is the dominant player on the grounds that 250 businesses are under its umbrella, including large multinationals as well as smaller concerns. \"We are against this particular scheme - it is too big - but not against the concept [of congestion charging],\" she maintains. \"The alternatives have not been looked at properly. It's a case of this, or nothing ... a dash for cash.\" </p> <p>Jones, meanwhile, has taken defeat gracefully, although he believes that questions should be asked about the role of Peel Holdings. The build-up to his departure had already prompted complaints to the Electoral Commission by the passenger transport authority and, subsequently, to the police, which is investigating whether the funds Peel paid a market research firm - costs undisclosed - to survey voters in his former ward about their views on the proposed charge, breached electoral law. </p> <p>Revealingly, a community newspaper had obtained a tape of Peel's property director, Mike Butterworth, saying a survey had shown 60% of voters who supported Jones at the last election would vote against him if the charge was introduced. \"It's almost inconceivable that with a bit of the right sort of publicity he [Jones] can't be turfed out,\" Butterworth is reported to have added. Simpson subsequently described Butterworth's comments as \"unfortunate\". </p> <p>In a statement to Society Guardian, Peel says: \"No formal allegations have been made against Peel Holdings and we strongly refute that we have in any way breached electoral law. In November 2007, we commissioned a survey by an independent company to help us understand public perceptions on congestion charging in the constituencies and wards of several key political figures in the region.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"In a routine meeting with two political parties in January, 2008 - part of a series of meetings with councillors from all parties and several boroughs - we acknowledge that director Mike Butterworth used some inappropriate language in good humour. However, we strongly refute any breach of electoral law.\"</p> <p>But Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, says the episode marks a worrying trend in local democracy. \"I do not think it is very healthy, and there is something unsavoury with a company like Peel - privately owned, with no responsibility to shareholders - trying to exert influence in this way.\"</p> <p><strong>Commercial interests</strong></p> <p>He claims Peel's opposition to congestion charging came down to a simple, commercial proposition. \"They have a very car-dependent business, where good public transport serving other town centres is probably not good for their business, but their position is not rational.\" Officially, Leese remains cautiously optimistic. \"We can win it, but it is going to be tough,\" he concedes. </p> <p>Simpson denies that GMMG is against the principle of congestion charging. But he maintains that the Greater Manchester plan would be larger than any zone in the world, at 207sq km (80 sq miles) - compared with 6sq km (2.5 sq miles) in Singapore, and 28sq km (11 sq miles) in Stockholm. </p> <p>\"These proposals are very badly drawn together, and because of this they will have a damaging economic impact on the conurbation and the region,\" he says. Asked if opponents would instead back a smaller zone, he says they did not want to be drawn into detailed alternatives. But he warns that a majority of people working within the outer zone would be hit by a charge that would drive businesses away from Greater Manchester to alternative sites.</p> <p>In the centre ground, however, there is a view that - whatever the misgivings about the mechanics, and the cost of charging alone (maybe \u00a3300m to install the technology) - this represents the only chance Greater Manchester will have to improve its dysfunctional, deregulated, outdated transport system. \"If we lose this one, the money will simply go elsewhere - who knows, to London to bail out Boris [Johnson, the mayor] and the tube,\" says one key player. \"Do we really want that?\"</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Purvis has no need to hug a hoodie - they hug him first. It is testament to the work of youth charity Fairbridge, where Purvis started as chief executive almost six months ago, that when he recently saw Kay, a teenager at risk of school exclusion he met on a Fairbridge residential trip, the boy greeted him with a hug.</p> <p>Purvis was on the week-long sailing trip in Scotland in June with a group of disadvantaged teenagers - those not in school, employment or training - when a coat that Kay had placed on the deck fell overboard. The 15-year-old, previously moody and withdrawn, was amazed as the crew - eight other teenagers and four staff, including Purvis - turned the 92-foot vessel around and retrieved the coat. Purvis recalls: \"Kay realised he was part of a team, and everyone cared. He was fully engaged by the end of the trip, saying it was the best thing he'd ever done. That's just one small example of how people can go from years of cynicism to suddenly feeling that people care.\"</p> <p>The incident, as Purvis says, encapsulates how Fairbridge motivates hard-to-engage teenagers. Every year, the charity and its 280 staff support 3,600 young people, aged, 13 to 25, through centres in 15 of the most deprived inner-city areas in Britain. The charity, which started 25 years ago, deals with those who are excluded from school or homeless, involved in antisocial behaviour, violence, crime or substance misuse. Staff offer personal support through tailormade action plans and courses that hone skills such as literacy, numeracy, planning, team playing and business management. </p> <p>Youngsters stay for weeks or months, with the aim of returning to education or work, and the strong entrepreneurial slant to the projects - designing T-shirts and selling them on market stalls, for example - makes sense when you consider that Fairbridge's president is Damon Buffini, head of private equity firm Permira.</p> <p>At a time when youth gang violence and knife crime is dominating public and political debate, the work of organisations such as Fairbridge is crucial. \"The transformation is profound,\" Purvis says of the youngsters who self-refer to Fairbridge, or who are referred by councils or other agencies. \"You do a residential course, and the masks they wear when they arrive - the cynicism, the hardness, the expectation that they'll just be treated as a mini hooligan - start to drop away.\" Purvis adds that activities are designed to take people out of their comfort zone, raise their self-esteem and \"render the past irrelevant, so they're totally engaged\".<br><strong><br>Optimism and enthusiasm</strong></p> <p>Purvis worked in the private sector for 20 years before deciding to switch to the voluntary sector to do \"something that was real\". He liked the optimism and enthusiasm at Fairbridge when he applied for the job. He has always championed corporate social responsibility - for example, volunteering with a youth charity in the US, where he used to work. </p> <p>As managing director of natural skincare company Neal's Yard Remedies, he changed the firm's deficit into a profit and increased turnover by 250%. He has found common issues across the two sectors: \"The clarity of mission, clarity of expectations, financial rigour, an emphasis on meeting objectives have to be as robust in a charity as they do in business,\" he says.</p> <p>What sets Fairbridge apart from statutory youth services is its aim of focusing on the individual, and the acceptance that school-based learning does not suit everyone, says Purvis. Unlike the education system, if the support fails this time, you can always try again. \"Every young person has their own story, and we try to unlock it, find out what has affected them in the past and what their dreams are for the future, and create a sense of that journey,\" he says.</p> <p>Critics may knock the liberal-sounding approach, but it works. Not only do ex-service users constitute 20% of the charity's staff, but 81% of Fairbridge under-16s returned to education or training last year. So why do so many youngsters fail at school? \"Often they come from an extremely challenging home situation and they go into a big school with big class sizes without a sense of reference or boundary, and then the difficulties are just exacerbated,\" Purvis says.</p> <p>However, Fairbridge is certainly not about \"hand holding\", insists Purvis, his firm but fair demeanour reflecting the charity's ethos. The danger of supportive relationships is co-dependence, but Fairbridge aims to be a critical friend. \"We're not giving them a solution, but giving them the confidence to realise their dream,\" Purvis explains. \"We are entirely embracing and supporting, but also challenging.\"</p> <p><strong>Inevitable drop-outs</strong></p> <p>Given the nature of the client group, it is inevitable that many young people drop out. In early 2007, for example, Billy Cox, a 15-year-old who attended a Fairbridge centre in London, was fatally shot in a gang attack. Cox was under a supervision order for a burglary offence and was tagged and restricted to a curfew. \"It's not just a nice, smooth trajectory,\" Purvis, acknowledges.\"It's two steps forward and one step back.\"</p> <p>Disengaged youth, he argues, is the biggest problem facing society today: \"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and that divide has perpetuated this problem.\" So what is the answer?</p> <p>Although he has been in the army - his father was in the navy, so Purvis wanted to enrol in the forces for a time - he disagrees with plans backed by Gordon Brown earlier this year for army cadet corps in state schools. \"It is one remedy, and works for a certain group of people, but is certainly not a catch-all,\" he says. He favours the consultative approach, rather than prescribed rules \"where you either fit in or you don't and are thrown out\". Purvis also rejects tougher sentencing as a deterrent, in favour of \"sensible constructive alternatives to being bored\", such as more youth centres and community activities that encourage teamwork.</p> <p> In August, research from Clubs for Young People - the umbrella group of 3,000 UK youth clubs - showed that more asbos are issued where fewer clubs exist. Purvis is concerned about the economic downturn, which has impacted on the charity's cashflow. He admits: \"We're getting a lot of pledged funding, but people are very reluctant to pay. It is proving difficult to get the cash from the statutory services as well as private donors. We're having to work much harder to chase that money, which is pretty unforgivable.\"</p> <p>Purvis has also been shocked by the council postcode lottery for funding - an old problem across the sector. He says he was stunned when one council officer in a large city told Fairbridge that \"small charities are not part of our agenda\".</p> <p>Another challenge is that councils favour measurable results and a \"one size fits all\" approach to commissioning, but Fairbridge is driven by longer-term \"soft outcomes\" and a focus on individuals. He says that, in retailing, what you do in the shop is reflected by action at the tills, but \"in the charity world, you can do fantastic things for young people, but that doesn't immediately translate into funding\".</p> <p>Long-term financial planning is high on Purvis's agenda. His business background is apparent not only in his use of language - he talks of \"proving the social return on investment\" so funders see the impact of their money - but in his ambitious ideas. If the government offers tax breaks to companies that encourage employees to cycle to work, why not offer similar incentives to encourage staff to volunteer?</p> <p>As for Purvis's plans for Fairbridge, he wants to create more youth centres and hopes the charity will help make an impact on the problem of disengaged youth. He returns to the story of Kay, remarking that even investing a few days in the life of a troubled young person pays dividends. \"It was just a one-week period, and it teaches you how misguided young people are,\" he says. \"Seeing them change is fantastic.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 46.</p> <p><strong>Status</strong> Married; two children.</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Earls Court, west London.</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Shrewsbury School, Shropshire; English Speaking Union scholar, Kent School, Connecticut, US; Durham University, BA (Hons) economics and history; Institute for Management Development, Lausanne, Switzerland, (MBA).</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> April 2008-present: chief executive, Fairbridge; 2006-07: equity partner, Imagini business consultancy; 1999-2006: managing director, Neal's Yard Remedies; 1998: internal consultant, Cendant Corporation marketing company; 1994-96: managing director, KK Halifax Associates real estate company, Japan: 1992-94: country manager, Jardine Matheson Group, Vietnam; 1985: army officer (short service commission), Royal Green Jackets.</p> <p><strong>Interests</strong> Keeping fit, sailing, theatre.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, while writing a documentary on Kivalina, one of several Alaskan barrier-reef islands slipping into the sea, and among the world's worst ecological disasters, I stumbled on the state's 44-year-old governor Sarah Palin. Even then, as she posed in the snow-covered wilderness beside her seaplane and fresh animal kills, rumours swirled around her that she might be a vice-presidential contender. In an extraordinary twist of fate, this sharp-shooter and former small-town beauty queen, who until two years ago was mayor of her tiny hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, has become the American right's golden girl.</p> <p>Ever since the Palin family soap drama hit prime time, the mainstream media has focused on digging up the dirt, but there have been few mentions about her environmental history. Palin is governor of a state that has seen the most dramatic effects of a warming world, yet until last week she remained unconvinced that climate change is in any way man-made. \"The jury's still out on that one,\" she said, just days after the recent hurricanes and tropical storms were making their way across the Atlantic, offering a glimpse of the climate chaos that may be left for future generations.</p> <p>Palin, in a recent interview with Newsmax.com, accepted that warming would affect Alaska \"more than any other state, because of our location\". But she added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being manmade.\" Such a position would put her to the right even of President Bush and some of the oil companies - and it is now scaring the international community. </p> <p>Last Friday, she finally conceded that the problem might be man-made. In an interview with ABC television, she said: \"I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now.\"</p> <p>Chris Mooney, author of The Republican War on Science, says: \"The irony of a climate change denier being based in Alaska is breathtaking. The state is warming faster than practically anywhere else, with winter temperatures up by 6F since 1950. Visitors to Alaska can see the evidence all around, from drunken forests of semi-fallen trees and sunken roads, all unseated by the melting of the permafrost, to unprecedented forest fires.\"</p> <p>For conservation and animal protection groups, Palin has long been considered an enemy. According to Greenpeace, \"Palin has the most anti-environment records of any governor in the US. She has supported oil drilling in some of the most ecologically sensitive areas in Alaska, even when it meant sacrificing polar bears and beluga whales.\"</p> <p>Only this month, Palin told the Republican party convention: \"We Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska, we've got lots of both.\"</p> <p>Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US, says: \"Sarah Palin's record is not extensive - just two years ago she was the mayor of a city of fewer than 10,000 people - but what it indicates is troubling. She has been a friend of Big Oil, opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more Americans. Oh, and Palin's husband works for BP.\"</p> <p><strong>Literally drowning</strong></p> <p>Palin is, if nothing else, consistent. She tried to sue the US government to derail the listing of polar bears as a threatened species, fearing that it would get in the way of oil and gas development - this as the ice melts under their paws and they are literally drowning.</p> <p>She then wrote a piece for the New York Times, saying that these \"magnificent cuddly white bears are doing just fine and don't need our protection. If the ice melts, they'll adapt to living on land\". That is a contention most scientists found reckless, given that polar bears have shown little ability to feed on land.</p> <p>Palin also questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is melting the Arctic sea ice, but failed to mention oil drilling or the routine oil spills that, over the years, have destroyed the ecology of nearly 18,000 acres of wildlife and marine habitat.</p> <p>\"We need to drill, drill, drill,\" she told the Wall Street Journal recently, and she is in the forefront of moves to exploit the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). \"If Alaskans can't do that on our own land, then the nation is going to be in a world of hurt, depending on dangerous foreign powers.\" She argues that \"ANWR is only the size of the Los Angeles airport, and drilling there isn't environmentally destructive\".</p> <p>In oil-rich Alaska, that goes down well. Many residents support drilling in the 7.7m-hectare refuge on the north coast, an area considered by conservationists as a treasured wild place. \"If you're not for opening ANWR, in the state of Alaska, you couldn't get elected dog-catcher,\" says former Alaska state representative Ray Metcalfe, a Republican-turned-Democrat who supports Barack Obama.</p> <p>Alaska is wildly beautiful and sparsely populated, with abundant natural resources that more recently have started to become scarce. In her two years as governor, Palin has got her own pleasure out of its wildlife. There are photos of her posing with the bloodied carcasses of moose, caribou, elk and grizzly bear.</p> <p>This summer, she reached new lows in the eyes of conservationists by approving the killing of black bear sows with cubs. The year before, she put a $150 bounty on wolf paws to entice hunters to kill more of these elusive wild dogs. She also spent $400,000 of public money to defeat an initiative that would have banned aerial hunting of wolves for sport.</p> <p>\"Palin is an environmental horror story,\" claims conservationist Dave Chandler. \"Alaska's out-of-control wolf slaughter is pretty brutal. When she approved the killing of all wolves in the Cold Bay area, state officials illegally killed 14 wolf pups - after killing their mothers - by dragging them out of their dens and shooting them.\"</p> <p>When environmentalists or concerned citizens from the other 48 states (where wolves are protected) dared to object to the idea of a hunting free-for-all, Palin protested that they didn't \"understand rural Alaska\". </p> <p>The state that Palin governs consists of 660,000 people, with a minority that loves the wilderness and is animals, and a majority - mostly Republican - that appears to want to squeeze all the cash it can get out of the state before the oil dries up, the fish die and the wildlife disappears.</p> <p>Alaskans, who annually receive oil-royalty dividends - $1,654 each last year - think of themselves as fiercely independent, but in fact are completely dependent on oil. As in many resource-rich economies, this has tended to encouraged corruption and bad governance, and a culture of impunity among lawmakers. After a four-year FBI investigation, several Alaskan businessmen and politicians - including the state's US senator, Ted Stevens - have been convicted of making and taking bribes to keep a tax on oil profits at an artificially low 20%. Palin herself is facing one abuse-of-power investigation for allegedly using her position to settle family scores by exacting retribution against her former brother-in-law, a state trooper, and firing officials who would not toe the line.</p> <p><strong>Selling out</strong></p> <p>Palin claims to be embarrassed by Alaska's national reputation as a corrupt backwater. Yet critics say she is in the pocket of Big Oil and is maintaining the state's tradition of selling out its natural resources. She swept into the governor's office as a self-styled renegade, promising to shake up the status quo, but has fallen in line with the Republican political establishment who have traditionally served the interests of multinationals and their hunting, fishing, mining and oil-drilling buddies at the expense of the environment.</p> <p>John McCain's choice may reassure hardline Republicans, but for many Americans she is a frightening prospect: an anti-environmentalist who puts special interests above science and whose policies make the Bush administration look progressive; a pro-life hunter who opposes abortion, even in the cases of rape and incest, yet kills other living creatures for entertainment; and a Christian fundamentalist who thinks that the Iraq war is \"God's task for America\". </p> <p>She certainly stirs strong emotions. As former New York mayor Ed Koch said: \"She scares the hell out of me.\"</p>",
  "<p>Of all the inhabitants of the world's great cities, Muscovites - living in a country with a murder rate 16 times that of the UK - might have most to fear. Or perhaps the citizens of Mumbai or Sao Paulo, with their sprawling slums.</p> <p>But according to a study to be published this month, the most frightened of all are those who live in sunny, scenic Rome. Asked to identify their outlook on life, 46% of those polled chose uncertainty, while 12% chose outright fear. Adding the two figures to produce an overall apprehension index, researchers found Rome's score of 58% was significantly higher than the 36% average of 10 big cities across the globe from Tokyo to New York.</p> <p>The results, if representative of Italians in general, may help to explain why Silvio Berlusconi was returned to power this year on a hardline law-and-order platform. The capital's mayor, Gianni Alemanno, a Berlusconi ally and former neofascist, said: \"Unfortunately, Rome has serious problems with security.\" The opposition argued that the prevailing climate was the result of a campaign by the right to promote anxiety. Maria Pia Garavaglia, the deputy mayor in Rome's last, centre-left administration, said Alemanno had \"spent the election campaign depicting Rome as the Bronx of some years ago\".</p> <p>Rome is certainly not the most dangerous city in a country that statistics indicate is safer than many in the developed world. Comparisons are difficult because of different definitions and reporting rates, but according to the <a href=\"http://www.NationMaster.com\">NationMaster.com</a> website, the murder rate in Italy is lower than in Britain or France.</p> <p>The survey was carried out by the Censis foundation for a World Social Summit opening in Rome next Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>One is small and cute and scoffs sand eels. The other is big and ugly and eats anything. So you can predict the outcome of Gordon Ramsay's clifftop encounter with a puffin in Iceland. Groan, went the puffin. Crunch, went Ramsay's Icelandic puffin-hunting pal, and the bird's freshly wrung neck bowed to the celebrity chef's barbecue.</p> <p>Killing your meal on telly is the winning ingredient in modern cookery shows, adding an edgy authenticity to the blandest programme. From Jamie Oliver to Valentine Warner, every TV chef worth his salt must be shown shoot-ing or butchering helpless beasts.</p> <p>Not only did Ramsay and his Icelandic \"sky fishing\" guru bag four puffins in a big net, they ripped out their hearts and ate them raw. Ramsay declared he \"loved\" its \"unique\" flavour and vowed to hunt more.</p> <p>These antics attracted internet outrage and 42 complaints to Ofcom. The trouble is, Ramsay has a point. I had puffin for starters when I visited Reykjavik. I'm still racked with guilt - Atlantic puffins are adorable; its Latin name means \"little brother of the north\" for God's sake! - but an animal's aesthetic qualities shouldn't make it harder to eat.</p> <p>This little fella slipped down a treat. The rich, smooth smoked slithers of meat tasted livery and slightly fishy - the perfect appetiser for whale steak. (This was lean and meaty, and eating it was an act I won't defend.)</p> <p>Ramsay's detractors rightly argue we shouldn't be encouraged to eat a bird that is endangered and protected by law in Britain. But Ofcom decided that Ramsay's puffins were caught and killed humanely in a country where they are plentiful and a popular part of the national diet. The baffling bit was its declaration that it did not \"consider that this item went beyond the general expectations of the audience\". So we now expect our cookery shows to have a murder-their-own-meat segment? Killing for the pleasure of TV entertainment certainly leaves a nastier taste in the mouth than killing for the pleasure of eating.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Kay Graham was a 21-year-old single parent living on a Sheffield housing estate when she enrolled on a college access course and went on to get a first class degree in housing. Now 32, she has been a housing officer at Guinness Northern Counties since 2006. In 2007, she won the Chartered Institute of Housing's Student of the Year award.</strong></p> <p><strong>How did you get into housing?</strong></p> <p>I left my veterinary nursing job in 1998 when I was expecting my son, and my accommodation was tied to the job. I moved from Glossop back to Sheffield, and got a council house. That tenancy was my lifeline. I enrolled on a social studies and humanities access course at a local college. I had never planned a housing career but we had a visit from lecturers at Sheffield Hallam University and I could relate to the issues they described. </p> <p><strong>What was your degree like?</strong></p> <p>It was fantastic. It lasted four years as it was a sandwich course with a year placement which was invaluable to apply the theory to practice. The first year was more of a general introduction, concentrating on issues such as the government and incorporating modules such as research development. The final years had more specific key issues such as sustainable housing, health, homelessness and community care. In the fourth year we had a lot of guest speakers from outside organisations to talk to us about their experiences and we also had a fieldtrip to Dublin to experience housing from a different perspective. </p> <p><strong>What was the hardest aspect of your course?</strong></p> <p>Because I'm a people person and like rolling up my sleeves and getting stuck into frontline issues, I found the business side of things harder to get to grips with. </p> <p><strong>Why do you think social housing is still not regarded as a popular career option?</strong></p> <p>Housing management is important in sustaining communities - your home and where you live are the most important environmental things in your life. Although housing is better regarded as a profession than it used to be, I think most people don't automatically think of social housing as a career, and go for the other, more publicised areas such as property development or estate agency.</p> <p><strong>What advice would you give to anyone considering a career in housing?</strong></p> <p>I would say go for it. I went into housing as a \"mature student\" with children, so I think one of the best things about this as a career choice is that it applies to all walks of life. I found my studies so rewarding and now, I can't imagine not working in the sector. Even though I'm a relatively new starter, there's always so much going on in terms of new policy and legislation. </p> <p><strong>How has the credit crunch impacted on the work you do?</strong></p> <p>I've had training recently to help me support tenants who are in financial difficulty. I promote financial inclusion wherever possible and we have a welfare benefits advisor. As I have experienced severe financial exclusion myself, I'm very conscious of it and do my best to help and advise others.</p> <p><strong>What would you like to be doing in five year's time?</strong></p> <p>The only thing I'd like to do more of is one-to-one tenancy support, although I do address that in my current role already, my role is generic housing management. </p> <p>We can all see the way policy is now leaning, with housing organisations having more of an emphasis on supporting customers into employment, training and education. But I do think that people also need personal confidence to do this - and confidence building skills need to be rolled out in a support programme so people are more likely to take up the opportunities on offer. In doing this, we can support even our most vulnerable tenants to achieve their aspirations. </p> <p><strong>Interview by Saba Salman</strong></p> <p>Guinness Northern Counties: <a href=\"http://www.ncha.co.uk\">ncha.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A friend of mine, diagnosed with HIV, once sent out a Christmas card that said: \"A virus is for life, not just for Christmas.\" A few complained about his sense of humour, but most of us laughed. Sadly, he died with Aids before he could hear scientists announce this year that if you're diagnosed with HIV at the age of 35 in a developed country, with proper treatment you're likely to live to around 72 - only a few years below full life expectancy for a healthy adult.</p> <p>Treatments for HIV are now good enough, most of the time and for most people in the UK, to suppress the virus to an undetectable level and slow its progress into old age. But HIV science and HIV services have always operated on an assumption of youth. Nobody knows what happens when you get old with HIV, except those now sailing into their sunsets with it.</p> <p>There are going to be more and more people of pensionable age with HIV over the next decade. Already people over 45 account for more than a quarter of all those with HIV in the UK. A gay man over 50 is 14 times more likely to have the virus than one under 20.</p> <p>As we get older, we use more health services, yet people with HIV consistently report the NHS as one of the top three places that they encounter discrimination once they disclose their diagnosis. And side-effects of long-term HIV medication are still emerging - after all, we only discovered many treatments at the end of the last century. They can include high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes, which are also side-effects of ageing in a developed nation. At the less serious end of the scale, another friend said recently: \"I look at my pot belly in the mirror and I don't know whether to blame the virus, the treatments, old age or good cooking.\" A small number of HIV clinical researchers are now trying to disentangle those puzzles.</p> <p>Apart from medical confusions, increasing numbers of people with HIV will access care services for elderly people in the near future. Currently, those services are far from ready, as one lady living with HIV in her 70s, found out. Simply mentioning her HIV to her home help caused withdrawal of the service and a flurry of activity that eventually involved the local authority, her MP and national HIV services before the help was reinstated with an apology. </p> <p>For people diagnosed before the treatments existed, there's often also another small problem. Not expecting to live long, many gave up work, cashed in their pensions and spent them. But those who've lived beyond their expectations have also lived beyond their credit, and the Terrence Higgins Trust is increasingly being asked for help with problems of debt and poverty by people whose benefits have been reduced because they are no longer expected to die, yet who can't find work.</p> <p>Ageing carries a stigma in our youth-oriented society, but it ought to be a cause for celebration for thousands of people with HIV who never thought they'd see their pension books. Those of us responsible for elderly services, health services and social care need to ensure we're ready for the greying of HIV, and the challenges that will bring. And across the UK, people with HIV who are on treatment and managing to keep their virus in check need to start planning to make that hard-fought-for future one worth having.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lisa Power is head of policy at the Terrance Higgins Trust <a href=\"http://www.tht.org.uk\">tht.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Johannesburg.</strong> Rescue workers were last night searching through shafts filled with poisonous gas for more than 150 missing miners feared dead after an underground fire led to one of the worst ever mining disasters in South Africa. A spokesman for the gold mine's owners, General Mining Union, said last night that 44 bodies had already been found, and a further 183 injured had been brought to the surface. Rescue teams were still searching for the missing miners. Earlier reports said that all of the miners found dead were black. [The final death toll was 170. It was the country's worst mine disaster.]</p> <p>But the manager of the Kinross gold mine in Eastern Transvaal, Mr Kobus Olivier, said that the chances of finding them alive were slight. More than 2,000 of the 2,500 miners affected by the fire were brought safely out of the mine shafts, Mr Olivier said. He said 50 rescuers were in the mine more than 14 hours after the fire started, still looking for miners who remained underground.</p> <p>One eyewitness spoke of seeing more than one hundred bodies lying near the mine. The disaster started when a welder accidentally started a fire near the mine's number two shaft before noon yesterday. The fire was brought under control, but by that time noxious fumes had entered the shaft. The fumes may have been caused when the fire spread to chemicals.</p> <p>Those brought to the surface alive had apparently escaped by staying in pockets of air in mine passages near where the fire began, about a mile underground. The general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, described the disaster as the biggest since 1983, when 68 miners were killed at the Hlobane mine in northern Natal. Yesterday's disaster was a grave catastrophe which would have to be investigated fully, Mr Ramaphosa said.</p> <p>The NUM is the biggest black trade union in South Africa. Accidents on South African mines have claimed 10,000 lives in the past 20 years. They have become a cause of tension between the NUM and the mining companies with the trade union accusing mine managements of treating the lives of black miners with negligence.</p> <p>The Chamber of Mines, the industry-wide management group, coincidentally issued a report yesterday saying that in the first half of this year the fatality rate for accidents in gold mines had dropped for the first time below one per 1,000 workers. The chamber said the injury rate was halved during the past 10 years, to 18.81 per 1,000 miners.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The World at One</strong> (Radio 4) yesterday was a bumpy place, full of headlines about rising inflation and plunging stock markets. Yet the programme didn't match reality. Martha Kearney, presenting from a noisy spot at the Liberal Democrats' conference - yes, in Bournemouth, when all other eyes were fixed on Wall Street - was unusually lacklustre. </p> <p>Maybe it was just the conference hum in the background, or a delay on a couple of phone lines. Or maybe something really distracting was going on in the Lib Dem foyer: say, Vince Cable doing cartwheels with a rose in his teeth. After a while, with Kearney hesitant and flat in her delivery, you did start to wonder. </p> <p>She sounded as if she was looking over the shoulder of whomever she was talking to, seeking out someone more interesting. This would be bad enough on a quiet news day, let alone on one where every comment was along the lines of \"investment banks are falling like ninepins\". In a limp discussion with financial analyst Emily Benson, both women sounded in need of strong coffee. Benson repeatedly faltered, coating everything with \"um\" and \"er\", while Kearney seemed to find her own questions enervating in the extreme.</p>",
  "<h2>New contract pays NHS dentists around \u00a396,000</h2> <p>The pre-tax earnings of all NHS dentists averaged \u00a396,135 in 2006-07 during the first year of a contract that was designed to remove a financial incentive to drill and fill more teeth, the government's health information centre said yesterday. Earnings of higher-paid dentists on contract with the NHS rose by 34.9% to \u00a3172,494, but the centre said changes in data collection made comparison with previous years unreliable. The figures included income from private practice as well as NHS work.

The women, aged 17 and 20 and from the Derby area, were detained after the drugs, weighing around 2.3kg, were allegedly discovered stitched into the hair pieces, a spokeswoman for the UK's Revenue and Customs said. The pair, both unemployed, had been on holiday in Jamaica for two weeks before their arrests, she added.

Craig Meehan, 22, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was given a 20-week prison term but released immediately after serving 23 weeks on remand in jail. Meehan was told by district judge Jonathan Bennett that children in the photographs must have suffered \"unimaginable damage\".

The Oscar-winning 1994 film is a road movie following two drag queens and a transsexual crossing the Outback in a battered bus - Priscilla. It has been a smash hit in Australia as a stage musical since 2004, winning awards for the performers and the outrageous costumes, created by the original film costume designers.

Yesterday morning alone made \u00a324.3m, with all 80 lots sold, added to Monday night's \u00a370m. Sotheby's has not revealed its deal with the artist, but he will have done far better than if selling through his regular galleries, which take commissions of up to 50%.

  "<p>Gwyneth, now 44, a nurse from the home counties, was 32 and single when she decided she could not wait any longer to conceive a child. \"I've always known that having a child was more important to me than being in a relationship. I'd done what I wanted career-wise, I'd travelled and worked in Australia. A lot of my friends were settling down and having children. And as a nurse I was aware that after 35 it would be harder to conceive. I just thought it was the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>She did not know anyone who had done this but had read about the London Women's Clinic, which has treated single women since the late 1980s. She signed up for private treatment: donor insemination at \u00a3170 for each attempt, plus her travel costs. \"It was costing me about \u00a3200 a month - and it took nine tries over 15 months. In those days they were just doing cervical insemination [when the sperm is inserted into the cervix] - now they tend to do IUI [sperm is inserted into the uterus] - and the success rates were much lower.\" However, at the age of 33, she conceived her daughter, Helen, now 10, and became one of the UK's first - and, then, youngest - \"choice mothers\". </p> <p>Ten years on and this group of women is growing. So-called \"single motherhood by choice\" has always existed: around 250 of the 1,100-strong membership of the UK's Donor Conception Network (DCN) are single mothers. Usually this is a decision women come to in their late 30s or early 40s. Not any more. Olivia Montuschi, a spokeswoman for the DCN, reports that the organisation has been approached recently by a several women in their early 30s already considering donor insemination: \"It's increasingly an option. They're more likely to conceive [at this age], of course. But the idea that women are giving up on finding a man at 33 or 34 does seem a bit sad.\" The DCN has relaunched a Single Women section on its website and released a leaflet entitled: Dear Would-Be Single Mum.</p> <p>A survey of attitudes towards contraception out this week appears to confirm this as a trend. Both men and women said they had serious concerns about whether they would meet the right partner in time to conceive naturally; and 56% of the women asked said they would consider asking a male friend to father their child if they failed to find a partner by a certain age. And it was younger women - those aged between 28 and 31 - who were the most likely to go it alone if the right man did not turn up in time.</p> <p>Seeking artificial insemination in your 20s or 30s is not unusual among lesbians (who have no reason to delay), but heterosexual women typically wait to see if they can find a partner first. Using a sperm donor has always been a last resort. Now the process is becoming a first resort. Say that you are in your early 30s and you are convinced your life will not be complete without a child. Why wait? Many women have financial independence earlier in life than in the past and few see being a single mother as a situation that carries a stigma. Many single mothers by choice argue that they see couples struggling with the difficult issues that shared parenting raises. Women in this category who know that they definitely want a baby are less concerned about raising a child alone than they are about waiting for the \"right man\" for so long that they miss their fertility window. </p> <p>On the Single Women forum at the website Fertility Friends - an invaluable resource for anyone seeking any kind of fertility treatment - there are dozens of posts from single, heterosexual women under 35 seeking donor insemination. One, now 36, tells of how she first saw her GP in April 2006 at the age of 34 and went on an NHS waiting list for donor sperm later that year. Another woman writes, \"I am a 31-year-old single woman considering donor insemination to start a family as Mr Right still hasn't appeared.\"</p> <p>Their forum sign-offs all include their ages, fertility history and often their reasons for doing it. Some of the stories are heartbreaking: \"36-year-old single girl. Currently flummoxed by Inhibin B test results [a test that can diagnose problems with ovulation]. Wondering whether to co-parent with lovely gay friend.\" Another writes: \"Eeeek! 35 now! Not sure what's next. Watch this space!\" There is a post from a 34-year-old woman who has been trying to get pregnant for the past two years using donor sperm from the UK and the US - but who has just discovered that she has polycystic ovaries, which can reduce fertility. Several women have been through IUI with donor sperm five or six times with no success and are now considering IVF. Many mention how difficult it is to go through these treatments on your own, without a partner, and how heavily they rely on the support of friends and family.</p> <p>In many ways it is an extraordinary decision to use donor sperm in your early 30s because you are fed up waiting for a partner. Some campaigners argue that choice mothers are wrongfully depriving their children of a father. But many women in this position think long and hard about this aspect of their decision and often line up a host of male role models in advance. Gwyneth says of 10-year-old Helen: \"I think there are some children who grow up perfectly well without male role models - and she has got my father, my brother and my nephew.\"</p> <p>But there are also long-term implications for the woman's future relationship status. As any single parent knows, it's more difficult to meet someone once you're in that situation. \"Quite honestly, I've never had a serious relationship,\" admits Gwyneth. \"It's just never been a priority for me. And since my daughter was born, finding the time for a relationship is just impossible.\" She could do with someone to help out: \"It is difficult when you have to work full-time and raise a child. You don't get the after-school time with them because they're in an after-school club. But it's definitely worth it.\" But she does not romanticise the lives of two-parent families: \"Our children don't have to go through the pain of seeing their parents separate,\" says Gwyneth.</p> <p>Another single mother by choice, Lucy (not her real name), 47, a marketing executive from Northern Ireland, argues that by definition this situation makes you a responsible parent. \"The thing is, you are making a proactive decision. It's very different to those single parents who through no choice of their own have ended up with two or more children.\" She has not had a relationship for over seven years: \"I suspect I actually wanted a child much more than a partner. I would be concerned about the impact on my son if I got into a relationship. It seems pointless actively pursuing any love interest if it could impact negatively on him.\"</p> <p>For Amy (not her real name), 32, from the south of England, mother of an 18-month-old daughter, it was about abandoning the need for a man and getting on with her own life. \"I didn't have a great childhood, which has made relationships quite difficult for me,\" she says, \"I thought about the possibility of a one-night stand [to get pregnant] but I wouldn't go and sleep with someone just to get a baby. I feel a lot better saying she was the product of sperm donation. She's planned and she's loved. OK, she doesn't know who her dad is but at least she's not the result of a quick fumble.\" </p> <p>Amy sought treatment at the age of 30. \"I just thought: I want a baby and I need to do something about it. I could have waited but I didn't think time was on my side. I thought it would take years and I was just lucky it worked for me first time.\" She ordered sperm from an agency listed on the internet at a cost of around \u00a3400. \"I was sent a list of (anonymous) donors in my area and I chose one of them. I had to wait until one of my ovulation tests was positive and then contact them. They sent me the sperm by courier that evening. It arrived in a little pot inside a Pizza Hut-type padded bag. There was a note with instructions and a syringe. I expected it to be much more complicated, but it wasn't.\"</p> <p>Amy was shocked that it was so easy - and that she got pregnant immediately. She acknowledges that the whole thing happened a bit too fast. She now feels uncomfortable that her daughter will never be able to trace her father: \"fresh\" sperm falls outside the law and so donors are not required to register with the authorities. The Donor Conception Network unequivocally advises against using these services: \"There is so much that can go wrong,\" says Montuschi, \"There is very little information on the donors and you are not covered by any legal structure.\" Clinics should be registered with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. </p> <p>\"I do feel sad about it,\" says Amy, \"but I will tell my daughter that she is really loved and that I wanted her so badly that this is the way I went about it and that I chose the best person I could out of the choice that I had.\" She was told the age, height, colour of hair and of eyes of the donor. \"Part of me asks if I did the right thing for her. It does sound crazy. But I don't regret it because I have a beautiful daughter who has got everything I can ever give her.\" Amy is on long-term sick leave from work, takes in ironing to make ends meet and lives with a female flatmate who also helps out.</p> <p>She intends to repeat the process once she has finished breastfeeding her daughter. She has been back in touch with the same agency. </p> <p>\"I want to try for a brother or a sister with the same donor. They have said he would do it again. I want her to have somebody growing up with her. If I give her a full brother or sister she will have someone else who is completely genetically hers and I will know that she will always have this person.\" (That is, of course, if the agency she is using is telling the truth about the unregistered, anonymous donor.)</p> <p>Although some choice mothers would not approve of using unregulated sperm donations, there seems to be a consensus that Amy was right to start early. Mikki Morrissette, \"choice mom\" from Minnesota and author of Choosing Single Motherhood: The Thinking Woman's Guide, says that in the US \"there are more women today who don't particularly care if they are in a lifetime commitment but do care to have children, and figure they might as well get started.\" </p> <p>She has noticed more women in their 20s joining her online discussion group. \"I don't know their stories well enough to know the deeper reasons for this but I suspect it might have to do with some bad examples in fathering or dating - which is too bad if that's the case, since there are good men out there. But I'm also seeing a lot of women who are trying to decide whether to stay with a partner who doesn't want children.\" </p> <p>Morrissette herself married after becoming a choice mother: she met her husband when she already had one donor-conceived child, a three-year-old girl, and was pregnant with a second, a boy. Both live in separate houses and, despite being married, operate as single parents.</p> <p>The early 30s are not too young to start planning a path to single parenthood, she says: \"It's a shame not to have a partner when you have to deal with infertility challenges, but the earlier you seek out your fertility information, the more time you have to prepare for the next plan, whether it be IVF, adoption, foster care or childlessness.\" Older choice mothers often warn younger ones not to wait, she adds: \"Many women had trouble conceiving siblings for their first child, which tends to be a regret.\"</p> <p>This is the case for Lucy from Northern Ireland: her donor-conceived son is six years old and she is sorry he will most likely not have a sibling. \"The chances of conceiving are so much higher when you're younger. I've been contacted by women of 40-plus who haven't been able to get pregnant via this route.\" As a younger woman she wrote off donor conception. \"I was more concerned with finding a partner and looked on having children as something I would do if I found the right person. Also, because of all the negative publicity at the time about single parents, I assumed it was an extremely tough job - which I accept that it is. So I decided single parenthood would be too tough a challenge for me.\"</p> <p>When she had a relationship in her late 30s with a male single parent she saw that it was not an insurmountable challenge. \"It made me realise how much I wanted a child and I reassessed everything. While I would have loved to have that relationship with a life partner, having a child was now more of a priority. That was the turning point. After that relationship finished, I read an article where some choice mothers were interviewed and they were so positive and candid that I thought - yes, maybe this is possible.\" Her treatment at King's College Hospital in London worked on the first attempt.</p> <p>Now she wishes that she had started in her 30s. \"I'll always wish I could have provided my son with a sibling. It's not out of the question, with adoption. But it is the one factor that I never really considered.\" And she occasionally feels uncomfortable about him being an only child. \"You bond with other mothers who are having their first child. Then two years down the line they have another and you think, 'Well, that isn't an option for me',\" she adds.</p> <p>Lucy also wishes that more women had the chance to think about this earlier, adding that as choice mothers tend to be older, if they do have two donor-conceived children, they tend to have them very close together: \"It's financially difficult to pay the childcare costs for two young children. If you have a gap, then it is easier.\" Although waiting has its compensations too. \"By leaving it until I was 40, friends could see that there had been a number of failed relationships and felt that I deserved some personal happiness. It wasn't that I hadn't sought a life partner. I had just been unlucky,\" she says.</p> <p>First-resort donor conception is not for the fainthearted. But it is, Gwyneth argues, a sensible decision for women who are certain that having a child is the single most important consideration in their life. If you are that sure, why put it off? \"I always knew that I wanted children. You can have a relationship later in life. But your child-bearing years are limited,\" she says.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Visit <a href=\"http://www.donor-conception-network.org\">www.donor-conception-network.org</a> or call 020-8245 4369 for more information</p>",
  "<p>A security guard and a young shopper who ran to his aid during an armed robbery were in hospital last night after both men were shot in the leg.</p> <p>The attack happened when two men ambushed a security van as it delivered money to a supermarket cash dispenser yesterday morning. </p> <p>The robbers approached one of the guards as he got out of his van and tried to wrestle a strongbox from him. </p> <p>The young man who intervened, thought to be in his 20s, had been shopping in the supermarket and saw what happened.</p> <p>He ran over to help the security guard and after a short struggle it is thought one of the attackers pulled out a gun and shot both men in the leg before escaping on a motorbike. </p> <p>The pair were taken to Stoke Mandeville hospital, where they were being treated for their injuries. </p> <p>The security guard is thought to have lost a lot of blood and was in a critical condition.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337697482\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1799177080_young-voters-Brightcove-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>It is voter registration day on the campus of Kutztown university in Pennsylvania and a small but dogged group of students are trying to persuade classmates to sign up for the November presidential election. Decades ago they might have done so through bribery or, failing that, the fist; but these days the preferred method is humour.</p> <p>\"Voting is sexy and easy - register now!\" says a poster on the wall, alongside a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey panel which students play blindfolded.</p> <p>Ostensibly, the voter drive is non-partisan, but it is clear from flyers on the table this group backs Barack Obama. They are part of the Students4Obama movement that has swept through more than 700 campuses across America in a revival of youth engagement that could be decisive on polling day.</p> <p>While the battle for the White House appears to be tightening, the campus remains one place where Obama can still expect overwhelming support. His dominance among young voters is clear in Kutztown, a state university that draws its students from across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.</p> <p>Obama supporters in Kutztown are organised through a cyber club on the social-networking site Facebook, which boasts 957 members. They hold regular rallies and parties, hand out leaflets countering the negative ads put out by the McCain campaign, and gently browbeat their fellows into signing up to vote. \"I believe Obama's genuine,\" says Erika Reinhard, 22, who devotes up to six hours a week on the campaign. \"He promises to reunite the country, and that's what we need.\"</p> <p>By contrast, there can be few positions in politics lonelier than that of the Republican student organiser. Zac Roberts, 21, is president of the Kutztown university body which boasts a membership of barely 30 out of 10,000 students and is thoroughly out-gunned by their Democratic rivals. Asked about the Republican Facebook group, he replies: \"That's a good idea. I might set one up.\"</p> <p>Such disparities are replicated among Pennsylvania's 780,000 student population, and in campuses throughout the US. It is highlighted by the work of Harvard University's Institute of Politics, which tracked the behaviour of young voters for the past eight years.</p> <p>It shows that while John Kerry enjoyed a 13-point lead on George Bush among 18- to 24-year-olds at this stage in the 2004 election, Obama is 23 points ahead of John McCain. The institute's researchers have found exceptional levels this year of engagement among the young, with 62% of young voters reporting that they were excited about the election and more than two-thirds saying they were definitely, or probably, intending to vote.</p> <p>It was not ever thus. When the Harvard project began in 2000, it found a mood among students that was apathetic, as reflected in a dismal turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds of 30% - well below the figure for all ages of 51%.</p> <p>Then came 9/11, a catastrophe that changed everything, says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard institute. \"There was a massive change in attitude, especially among young people, towards politics being important in their lives.\"</p> <p>The transformation was well under way before Obama hit the headlines. Della Volpe sees it as a profound generational shift among what many analysts call the \"millennial generation\" - those born in the 1980s and 90s and now reaching a political coming of age.</p> <p>He points out that this generation accounts for a quarter of Americans and is the largest in history - bigger, even, than the baby boomers. As such, Della Volpe is convinced it is large enough and enthusiastic enough to hold the balance of power in November.</p> <p>Peter Levine, who heads Circle, a nonpartisan research body at Tufts university that studies political engagement among young voters, traces the shift to a growing optimism. The deep distrust in politicians found among the so-called Generation X of the mid-60s and 70s, and their pessimism in their ability to influence affairs, has given way to renewed faith in politics as a force for good. Levine says: \"That makes them more motivated to support a candidate, as otherwise why bother? And it also has a fit with Obama, as he stands for making things better.\"</p> <p>Though the generational shift predated him, Obama has appropriated it as his own. Not only is his message of hope tailored to attract the young, but he has also constructed a campaign that talks their language.</p> <p>Howard Dean set a precedent in this regard with his primary run in 2004, in which he launched Meetup, an online campaign that drove thousands of first-time voters into his camp. The Obama campaign has built on that experience directly - its new-media director, Joe Rospars, cut his political teeth with the Dean campaign.</p> <p>Facebook tells the story. As of last night, Obama had 1,847,187 Facebook friends. McCain had 335,528. On top of that, the campaign has created platforms across numerous internet-networking sites, from Twitter to Faithbase and BlackPlanet. The beauty of the approach is that it is bottom up rather than top down, allowing young people to run their own Obama-supporting groups unfettered by central control.</p> <p>The technique has unleashed huge energy in the process at relatively little cost. Studies have shown that while it costs $60 to mobilise one voter through direct mail, and $30 through phone banking, it costs only $1.56 through cyberspace tools such as social networking sites, text-messaging and email.</p> <p>The impact was visible in the primaries and caucuses, where 7 million voters under 30 turned out, helping to trounce the hopes of Hillary Clinton by voting for Obama in a ratio of four to one. The impact is also visible in Kutztown, where the student Obama group stages events with only minimal contact with the official Democratic campaign. </p> <p>It's not an entirely painless business, nor one devoid of anxiety. Erika Reinhard says she has found it harder since the summer break to get other students \"fired up\", as Obama would put it, about his candidacy. A sense of urgency has dissipated which the group is scrambling to reignite. \"A lot of people are supporting Obama, but I'm not sure they will make it to the polling booth.\"</p> <p>Her anxieties have some grounding. According to Circle, young people aged 18 to 29 are the most likely group to remain undecided about their voting intentions until election day.</p> <p>But the degree of jitters that remains on Obama's side is insufficient to cheer up Zac Roberts as he contemplates electoral oblivion for McCain, at least on this campus. \"Students are getting politically engaged again,\" he says mournfully. \"Young people don't understand what they are talking about, and I would rather they just didn't get involved.\"</p>",
  "<p>Storm clouds are gathering over Cornwall's granite spine as campaigners battle to retain open access and prevent thousands of metres of barbed wire being erected on of West Penwith moor, one of England's wildest and most dramatic places. </p> <p>The moor is a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, a world heritage site, and is one of the most influential landscapes in 20th-century British art - immortalised by the work of Barbara Hepworth and Sir Terry Frost, to name two. </p> <p>The problem is that Natural England - the government agency with a remit \"to conserve and enhance the natural environment\" - has joined with the National Trust, Penwith council and Cornwall county council in proposing a new \"sustainable\" grazing scheme that will introduce cattle and include electric fences, modern gates, water troughs, cattle grids, and new road signs. Objectors argue that any attempt to tamper, tidy, cultivate or refine - beyond repairing what is already there - will inevitably diminish Penwith's historic integrity. </p> <p>The plan is part of a wider north-west European initiative known as the Heath (heathland, environment, agriculture, tourism, heritage) project, funded by the EU and the Heritage Lottery Fund. The objective is to halt decline in heathland and to increase biodiversity by subsidising farmers to graze cattle to control scrub, gorse and bracken on a scheme known as \"high level stewardship\".</p> <p>In all, there are 32 separate areas on the Land's End peninsula earmarked for the project, but it represents the biggest human intervention in living memory to West Penwith's moorland, and is a radical change of policy after 20 years of the current environmentally sensitive area scheme, which has always adopted a \"hands off\" monitoring approach. </p> <p>At the heart of this protest is a clash of values between professional conservationists and people who use the moor regularly. The former group, concerned about the neglect and spread of gorse and bracken, are poised and eager to employ their \"best practice\" manuals on \"enhancing\" the moorland habitat. But they are opposed by large numbers of people who are unconvinced that it is either necessary or desirable to tamper with the moor in this way, and who argue that the value of this landscape lies in its raw simplicity. </p> <p>Peter Bowden, Cornwall's management team leader for Natural England, says ideas on how to preserve the moor best have evolved . \"The environmentally sensitive area schemes were our first stab at environmental management, and I think as time goes on we try to improve on what we have done before,\" he argues. \"Protecting biodiversity is our objective, and with gorse and bracken you do not get the same diversity of plants or animals.\" </p> <p>A recent statement by Bowden in the local press that an \"accidental or deliberate\" gorse fire could lead to \"a wall of flames heading towards people's cottages\" unless cows were grazed was dismissed by campaigners, fiercely opposed to the scheme, as political scaremongering. \"Natural England's case is crumbling under the sheer weight of the opposition to it,\" says Save Penwith Moors (SPM) campaigner Craig Weatherhill, formerly a conservation officer for Penwith council. \"They are reverting to trying to win their case by frightening the public. </p> <p>\"This is not an ecology project. It's about modern governmental, quangoid thinking that means now even areas of wilderness must be managed. It will utterly change the wild character of the moor by introducing cattle. Grazing will oust the present wildlife and replace it with another. This cannot be acceptable.\" </p> <p>Jon Brookes, National Trust's property manager for West Penwith, claims grazing would \"bring the moors alive\". He says: \"You can't walk on the moors because you will be ripped apart, but the cattle make tracks in the gorse and stop it being so dominant. I've got surveys a metre thick that prove this is the right way forward, and you will not find a conservationist who will tell you otherwise. We don't have the resources to control gorse by hand. Grazing animals is the most sustainable way.\"</p> <p>Bart O'Farrell, member of the Cornwall Archaeological Society, disagrees. \"Right to roam is being damaged,\" he says. \"The geology of the land is being damaged by fences - and fencing means ownership. Once they're in, it's really difficult to get rid of that.\"</p> <p>Local MP Andrew George is also taking a close interest in the issues. \"Many of my constituents are concerned that the plans would destroy the amenity and informality of these areas with regimented barbed wire electric fencing,\" he says. \"As far as I am aware, grazing cattle do not make any impact on bracken, gorse or Japanese Knotweed, as they don't eat these.\"</p> <p><strong>Negative visual impact</strong></p> <p>Critics say any benefits from the project are outweighed by the negative visual impact, curtailment of people's rights, and the raft of health and safety issues - not least, the possibility of cattle straying on to the notoriously fog-bound coast road. \"It's been very badly thought through,\" says the SPM campaign coordinator, author Ian McNeil Cooke. \"Tourism is the life blood of this area. The magical feeling of freedom while walking the moors will be lost if it goes ahead.\"</p> <p>Of particular concern to the campaigners is the proposed enclosure, for grazing, of the three popular, archaeologically-rich areas that have always had open access: Nine Maidens Common, near Madron; Carn Kenidjack, above St Just; and Carn Galva, above Bosigran. </p> <p>On Sunday, SPM is planning to hold a moorland \"protest walk\", and has recently had a display in St Just, with photographs and maps. \"Hundreds of people came,\" Mc Neil Cooke says. \"It's always that same amazed reaction we get when people realise the scope of the project. So far we have a petition of over 600 residents.\"</p> <p>It is the unique, indefinable quality of the area that campaigners fear will be lost. \"For many, these areas are an important artistic inspiration that can create a spiritual connection with the numerous prehistoric sacred sites and natural granite outcrops that dot this ancient landscape,\" says McNeil Cooke. \"These moors should be left alone. Their enclosure will be a disaster not easily undone.\"</p>",
  "<p>Tucked away up a side street in south-west London is a new development in social networking. At first glance, the people drawing, working on computers, and making sandwiches look like a typical community club; but the Saturday Club is a social group with a difference. Almost all of the members have been homeless, many have had drink or drug problems and some have spent time in prison. What makes the club even more unusual is that it is run by service users from homelessness charity Thames Reach. </p> <p>Club members launched it three years ago because Thames Reach's social activities closed at the weekend, leaving them isolated. Lack of social contact is especially hard for those trying to stay off drink and drugs. Club chairman, Dennis Rogers, who lives in rented accommodation with support visits from Thames Reach workers, sums up its importance: \"For people who have just come off [drink or drugs] it is a safe place. At the very start, coming here helped me to keep myself safe and now it is nice for me to encourage other people that there are other things than drinking or taking drugs.\" </p> <p>Social networks are vital in helping people overcome homelessness, drink and drug problems. </p> <p><strong>Losing their place</strong></p> <p>Thames Reach's research into this in 2002, Dreams Deferred, said charities should recognise that many homeless people have to move away from their social networks to escape problems or find housing. \"People lose some of their ability to socially interact and work in a group when they have been homeless or in a hostel and if they make life changes to move away from problems, they often lose their friendship group,\" says Vicky Mansell, learning and employment service manager at the charity. </p> <p>Actor, Joanna Lumley, donated an undisclosed amount to start the club after meeting one of its founder members. Because members run it themselves, the budget of almost \u00a38,000 goes further, although a caretaker has to be hired to open and close the building because the charity's insurance company does not allow services users to do so. Referrals to the group are handled by Thames Reach. \"We take on some very chaotic people sometimes, so we check if there has been a recent incident of violence because we would not want the group to have to face that with limited support,\" says Matt Wall, Thames Reach's learning and employment projects manager. \"But we haven't turned anyone away from the group.\" The group elected a committee and its members have been trained in everything from dealing with invoices and chairing meetings to health and safety and handling challenging behaviour. </p> <p>The club has grown from four members to 40. It runs activities and trips, including visits to museums and free shows at the Southbank in London, a sponsored walk across all of London's bridges to raise money for victims of the Asian tsunami, board games, drawing, photography, Spanish lessons, poetry, computer courses and bookbinding. </p> <p>Many in the group have experienced addictions or mental health problems, so they try to support others if they struggle. One member managed to stay sober for 23 weeks and the group encouraged him with cards and gifts. Rogers also phones up people before the club meets to encourage them to come along. \"A call each week does wonders. They might be isolated, have had a death in the family or be on a downer and that call can boost them.\" </p> <p>Running the club has not always been plain sailing. Rogers has taken people to hospital when they suffered mental health breakdowns and waited for them to see a specialist. But only three people have been excluded for a time, either for being argumentative or drinking on the premises. </p> <p>It is difficult to win government funding for the group as grants tend to be targeted towards activities such as getting people into work rather than enhancing social skills, says the group's secretary Maz Albrecht, a 46-year-old user of Thames Reach support services. Members have come up with innovative fundraising schemes to pay for the caretaker's time, the rent of the building and any trips and materials they might need. A sponsored walk is planned and they also recycle mobile phones to raise money. While the lack of government funding means it could close without fundraising, the shortfall gives users an opportunity to develop their budgeting, organisational and fundraising skills. </p> <p><strong>Social satisfaction</strong></p> <p>\"Coming to the group has really helped with my confidence because I do tend to isolate myself,\" says Albrecht. \"And it helps you back into a normal, sociable way of life; it shows you can be sociable without sitting in a pub.\" She points out that people are more likely to be able to hold down a tenancy and a job if they have fulfilling friendships and social lives to enjoy at the end of the working day.</p> <p>Tony Whittaker, a 66-year-old Saturday Club regular, said coming to the group stops him from \"vegetating at home\". A former drinker who spent time in prison in his youth, he used to sleep rough but has now been sober for 18 years. Using cookery skills learned in prison, he is the main chef behind the group's big monthly meal. \"I get pleasure from this because now and again I do some art work, like taking photos,\" he says, gesturing to a painting on the wall that club members made of London landmarks by copying his photographs. \"It's a long, long way from what I was and I feel a lot better.\"</p> <p><strong>Weblink</strong></p> <p>Thames Reach: <a href=\"http://www.thamesreach.org.uk\">thamesreach.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/housing.communities9\">What are...

  "<p>It's not quite the hunt for Deep Throat, but the media industry is consumed with curiosity over Bitchgate - ITV news anchor Mark Austin's veiled attacks on the rise of what Americans call autocuties: attractive but underqualified news presenters.</p> <p>\"There are a number of pretty young women and handsome young men without a solid journalistic background reading the news nowadays,\" Austin grumbled to the Radio Times. \"Naming no names, but particularly on the 24-hour news channels. I do believe, though, that they'll get found out. You don't need to have been to a war zone to read the news, but it does help.\"</p> <p>In one sense, this is nothing new. It is, after all, basically the plot of the 1987 movie Broadcast News, which satirised the hairdos' takeover of CBS News. Most of the time the ire from the hardbitten hack school is reserved for women - coded attacks on Natasha Kaplinsky or Sophie Raworth. Austin, however, was unusually even-handed in swiping at both sexes.</p> <p>But which male names are not named? Could it be BBC News Channel's boyishly good-looking James Dagwell, an English and Drama graduate whose CV boasts Newsround and BBC3 News but no actual cordite? Or Sky News's square-jawed Steve Dixon, who lists Radio Trent and Channel 5 News but doesn't mention being shelled by Serbian paramilitaries? Surely he can't be referring to Sky's Eamonn Holmes? There's no Bosnia or Beirut on his biography - although he's certainly a handsome man.</p> <p>More to the point, does his argument actually hold water? </p> <p>Is it necessary to have stared death in the face - or at least been escorted near death's face by Nato troops - to report on the collapse of Lehman Brothers or plots to overthrow Gordon Brown? </p> <p>Perhaps the answer can be found later in Austin's interview. He confesses that he was disappointed the new-look News At Ten presenter's gig went to Trevor McDonald instead of him. And while the nation's most trusted presenter has interviewed Saddam Hussein, Colonel Gadafy and Yasser Arafat, his CV lists no wars at all.</p>",
  "<p>The family of Meredith Kercher, the British student murdered in Perugia last November, came face to face with two of her alleged killers for the first time in an Italian court yesterday.</p> <p>Amanda Knox, 21, the American student who was Kercher's former flatmate, appeared nervous as she passed photographers outside the courtroom. Rudy Guede, 24, who has dual Italian and Ivorian citizenship, followed her minutes later. Knox's former boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito did not attend court, but it was unclear why not. One of his lawyers said he felt unwell, but another claimed the IT student wanted to avoid \"a media circus\". All three suspects, who are in custody, deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Yesterday's hearing was the first of six, after which Judge Paolo Micheli will decide whether to send Knox and Sollecito to trial next year. He accepted a request from Guede to undergo his own fast-track trial which could be concluded by the end of next month.</p> <p>As the hearing opened, fresh details emerged about a witness whose evidence could prove decisive against Knox and Sollecito. Antonio Curatolo, a homeless man interviewed on Monday on British television, alleges he saw them near the murder scene when both claim to have been at Sollecito's house.</p> <p>Judge Micheli allowed the Kercher family, who had travelled to Perugia for the hearing, to sue anyone found guilty for damages, a common practice under Italian law.</p>",
  "<p>The Department of Health will today identify the nine personality types of heavy drinkers at risk of liver damage and other alcohol-related illnesses that are costing the NHS in England about \u00a32.7bn a year.</p> <p>Its researchers investigated the social and psychological characteristics of problem drinkers in an attempt to devise more effective public health campaigns to encourage safer use of alcohol.</p> <p>They found that people who regularly drink at least twice the recommended limit, ie 35 units a week for women and 50 for men, ranged from depressives drinking at home alone over extended periods to macho exhibitionists who spend almost every evening in the pub.</p> <p>The department said it was using social marketing techniques to tailor its propaganda to suit all the target personalities.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"This will be a tough one to crack. Research found many positive associations with alcohol among the general public - even more so among those drinking at higher-risk levels. For these people alcohol is embedded in their identity and lifestyle: so much so that challenging this behaviour results in high levels of defensiveness, rejection or even outright denial.\"</p> <p>The nine alcohol-fuelled personality types are:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"De-stress drinkers\" use alcohol to regain control of life and calm down. They include middle-class women and men. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Conformist drinkers\" are driven by the need to belong and seek a structure to their lives. They are typically men aged 45 to 59 in clerical or manual jobs. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Boredom drinkers\" consume alcohol to pass the time, seeking stimulation to relieve the monotony of life. Alcohol helps them to feel comforted and secure. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Depressed drinkers\" may be of any age, gender or socioeconomic group. They crave comfort, safety and security. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Re-bonding drinkers\" are driven by a need to keep in touch with people who are close to them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Community drinkers\" are motivated by the need to belong. They are usually lower middle class men and women who drink in large friendship groups.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Hedonistic drinkers\" crave stimulation and want to abandon control. They are often divorced people with grown-up children, who want to stand out from the crowd. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Macho drinkers\" spend most of their spare time in pubs. They are mostly men of all ages who want to stand out from the crowd. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"Border dependents\" regard the pub as a home from home. They visit it during the day and the evening, on weekdays and at weekends, drinking fast and often. </p> <p>The department will today launch a trial information campaign in north-west England to persuade problem drinkers to cut down. It will include self-help packs, available online and in printed form, telling drinkers how to calculate the medical risks associated with different levels of alcohol intake. The DrinkCheck web tool will be available at <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/units\"> www.nhs.uk/units</a>.</p> <p>Dawn Primarolo, the public health minister, said: \"The pilot will help up to 4,000 drinkers cut down in the first year alone.\"</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Thursday September 18 2008. Some confusion crept into this report. We defined heavy drinkers as those who regularly consume at least twice the daily guidelines of 35 units a week for women and 50 for men. We meant to say that 35 units a week for women and 50 for men is twice the recommended limit. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<p>Ukraine was last night facing the prospect of further political instability and its sixth election in four years after the pro-western coalition formally collapsed.</p> <p>The government was made up of parties loyal to Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, and his 2004 Orange revolution partner, prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. It fell apart after months of bitter quarrelling between the leaders.</p> <p>The nine-month-old coalition's collapse is a major setback, and comes amid rising tensions with Russia over the war in Georgia and Ukraine's attempts to join Nato. </p> <p>Its politicians are split between those who condemn the Kremlin's invasion of Georgia, led by Yushchenko, and others including Timoshenko who believe Ukraine should be cautiously \"neutral\" in its dealings with Moscow. </p> <p>However, the collapse has little to do with resisting Russia or integrating with the west - it is about who holds power. Yushchenko and Tymoshenko are likely to be rivals in presidential elections in early 2010.</p> <p>\"I officially announce the termination of the democratic coalition in the Verkhovna rada [lower house],\" parliamentary speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk told MPs. \"It is yet another democratic challenge, but I hope that together we will overcome the challenge.\"</p> <p>The parliament now has 30 days to form a new coalition. Last night, however, indications suggested Tymoshenko was unlikely to form an alliance with the opposition Party of the Regions - making elections almost inevitable.</p> <p>The coalition split earlier this month after Tymoshenko's bloc and the Party of the Regions, led by the former prime minister Viktor Yanukovich, voted to strip Yushchenko of several powers. The president accused her of staging a parliamentary coup.</p> <p>The feud is further linked to which leader controls lucrative pipeline revenue on oil and gas shipped through Ukraine from Russia. \"It's not about being pro-western or pro-Russian. It's about who gets to sit on the pipe,\" one official remarked yesterday.</p> <p>\"Tymoshenko is only interested in what serves her. She wants a monopoly on power. She was pro-western when she needed the west's support. Now she trying to be pro-Russian.\" </p> <p>Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of betraying Ukraine's interests, and suggested voters would not forgive her. He also claimed the Kremlin was trying to promote \"internal instability\", and aiding separatists in Crimea who wanted to return the ethnic Russian region to Moscow's control.</p> <p>But he did not foresee any military action by Russia. \"Will they repeat the Georgian scenario? For sure, no,\" he told the Associated Press.</p> <p>Polls suggest Yushchenko's Our Ukraine party would be wise to avoid an election. According to a recent one, Tymoshenko's party would get 24%, the Party of Regions 23% and his bloc less than 4%.</p>",
  "<p>You expect nastiness from Doug Stanhope. Misogyny, misanthropy, despair - I've heard and embraced them all from this viciously funny US stand-up, because they are his points of access to comic insight, and his means of expressing a wounded idealism I find compelling. But tonight, he has got the balance wrong. The insights and moments of tenderness are steamrollered by unpleasantness, and one of the world's most exciting comics is in danger of being reduced to a peddler of (by his own admission) \"drunken hate speech\".</p> <p>He's still a brilliant stand-up: a poet of articulate disgust, unleashing fireballs of comedy from the hell of his own imagination. But his spirit is curdling into meanness. There's a tirade against climate change orthodoxy, which castigates women who give birth in poor countries, and argues that the best way to save the world is to stop having children - which rather misses the point that we want to save the world for our children to enjoy. And there is a too-long section in which the jokes against himself or the world in general cede to women-hating material, including a duff gynaecological routine about Sarah Palin and her \"retard baby\".</p> <p>This bar-room bullshit is way beneath Stanhope, as the rest of the set often demonstrates. There's bleak, great material about the futility of sex and the self-destructive instincts that seem unique to human beings. There's a show-stopping moment when he phones his sick mum from the stage to check whether she's dead yet. And a routine asking why sporting achievements are valued more highly than his own daredevil experiments with drugs. \"My adventures give me nothing except, perhaps, empathy for the human condition. And what's that worth? Jack shit.\" Like so few comics, Stanhope is asking the big questions, and not blinking at the answers. Drunken hate speech is an unwelcome distraction.</p>",
  "<p>So we saw him off. Last week, in a victory for both medicine and free speech, Matthias Rath dropped his libel suit against the Guardian. But it seems amazing that the courts of this country allowed him to pursue this case. Rath, a German doctor, appears to have encouraged South Africans with HIV to stop using anti-retroviral drugs, and take his vitamin pills instead. Several of them died. It's an important story, which shows journalists are of some use after all. But the Guardian stood to lose hundreds of thousands of pounds for having the impudence to publish it.</p> <p>This newspaper is big enough to look after itself. But the legal net that Rath used is now being cast to catch ever smaller fry. In the past few days, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has dropped its cases against some of its fans. I am now allowed to write about the worst example of legal bullying I have ever seen.</p> <p>The club has had serious problems, on and off the pitch, and many of its fans use an internet forum - <a href=\"http://www.owlstalk.co.uk\">owlstalk.co.uk</a> - to discuss them. They make the kind of comments you would expect to find on any talk board, and which would normally be forgotten within 15 minutes. Two and half years ago the club launched its first suit. Only now have the people who posted these comments emerged blinking from the labyrinthine nightmare of English law.</p> <p>As Geoffrey Robertson and Andrew Nicol explain in their excellent book, Media Law, England's defamation laws date back to a statute created in 1275. The criminal offence of scandalum magnatum was devised to protect \"the great men of the realm\" from stories which could stir the people against them. Three centuries later, the Star Chamber allowed noblemen to launch civil actions for libel, to provide them with an alternative to duelling.</p> <p>They made prolific use of this privilege until Fox's Libel Act of 1792 determined that the claimant (the person bringing the case) had to prove that the words used against him were false, malicious and damaging. This means that libel law 216 years ago was more liberal and more in tune with the principle of free speech than it is today. </p> <p>During the 19th and 20th centuries, Robertson and Nicol show, \"the common law was re-fashioned to serve the British class system from the perspective of ... the Victorian club\". To protect wealthy people from criticism, the courts reversed Fox's burden of proof. They created a presumption that any derogatory remark made about a gentleman must be false. This remains the case today. Defamation differs from all other civil or criminal laws in Britain: the burden of proof is on the defendant.</p> <p>The law remains the privilege of gentlemen, by which I mean people who are able to afford costs that often exceed \u00a31m on each side. Cases tend to be resolved by sheer financial might, as the plaintiffs bankrupt the defendants, or force them to give in before their money runs out. This ensures that the law retains its 13th-century function. It guarantees that most attempts to hold the wealthy to account founder before they are launched, as people bite their tongues for fear of losing their homes.</p> <p>Since 1879, corporations have also been able to sue for libel. The inequality of arms this causes is compounded by the fact that there is no legal aid for defamation cases. Lawyers are now allowed to fight these suits on a no-win, no-fee basis, but this freedom is double-edged: if a defendant loses, he could end up paying double the claimant's legal costs.</p> <p>This is the context in which Sheffield Wednesday went to court to demand the names and email addresses of 14 people who had posted comments on owlstalk. Here are some of the comments over which the club complained. \"What an embarrassing, pathetic, laughing stock of a football club we've become.\" \"Another day, another blunder. I doubt even Leeds were in such a mess this time last summer, and look what happened to them.\" \"I am waiting with bated breath to hear who the Chuckle Brothers have signed after their trip to watch players abroad. With the amount of money they have to spend and the wages they can offer the best we can hope for is that little known Transvestitavian International I Sukblodov, who last scored in a brothel.\"</p> <p>Such comments were deemed by Sheffield Wednesday's lawyers to be \"false and seriously defamatory messages\" which had caused grievous injury to the delicate flowers who ran the club. (They should try posting an article on the Guardian's Comment is Free site.) The lawyers threatened \"proceedings to include claims for injunctions, damages, interest and legal costs (which could be substantial)\". The judge threw most of the application out, but instructed the forum's host to reveal the email addresses of four of the posters, whose remarks seem to me to be almost as trivial as those he dismissed. This took place a year ago, and the long shadow of the law hung over the posters until the club's lawyers dropped the case last week.</p> <p>Another case dates back to February 2006, when the club sent a warning letter to a fan called Nigel Short. When he received the letter he offered to apologise and to change his comments, but the club rejected this. He was able to fight it only because he found a lawyer - Mark Lewis of George Davies Solicitors in Manchester - who was incensed by this case and was prepared to represent him. \"I've had two and a half years of worrying I was going to lose my house,\" Short tells me. \"It's been hell. If Mark hadn't done this no win, no fee, I would have been bankrupt by now.\"</p> <p>In November 2007, Short was diagnosed with throat cancer. The case continued. But on Wednesday September 3 he announced that his treatment had been successful. On Friday September 5, the club dropped the case and agreed to pay his costs. It issued a press release which suggested it had done so because of \"Mr Short's medical condition\". I asked the club whether it had abandoned the case because it knew that Short would now live to fight the action. It has refused to answer my questions.</p> <p>The point of this story is not that the directors of Sheffield Wednesday have behaved like a bunch of petulant bullies. It's that the law equips them to do so. Most people see this as an issue only for journalists. But the internet ensures that the law of defamation now threatens anyone who stands up for what he believes to be right. </p> <p>This autumn the English branch of PEN, which defends the freedom to write, will launch a campaign against our libel law. But where are the rest of you? Where are the petitions, the public protests, the lobbies of parliament? Why is this 13th-century law still permitted to stifle legitimate dissent? Wake up, Britain: your freedoms are disappearing into the pockets of barristers and billionaires.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Rugby Football Union is restructuring its communications department after the shambolic handling of Brian Ashton's departure from the England team.</p> <p>After a protracted and painful public debate as to whether to keep him as head coach, Ashton was hung out to dry by the RFU this year, with no clear message ever issued from Twickenham. So clumsily was the whole episode handled that, said one RFU source, the director of communications, Richard Prescott, has paid for it with his job by being \"moved sideways\". </p> <p>Prescott will be employed in a more junior position, taking control of the handling of the England team's affairs, with the appointment above him of a corporate communications and public affairs director. </p> <p>\"Richard Prescott has been consulted at length over the new department and fully supports its establishment and the [directorial] appointment to whom he will directly report,\" the RFU chief executive, Francis Baron, wrote in an email to staff.</p> <p>\"Richard will concentrate on the increased management requirements for all the England teams using the specialist knowledge and expertise gained from working successfully on the last three Rugby World Cups.\"</p> <p>Baron was not available for comment yesterday but Prescott is said to be excited about the opportunity to focus on Martin Johnson's England squad, who will convene for longer periods under the new Premiership agreement. </p> <p>The RFU's corporate restructuring will give rise to fresh speculation that it will bid to host the 2015 World Cup. The new man is likely to require strong ambassadorial skills.</p> <h2>Between the lines</h2> <p>One cause of the breakdown of the expected recruitment of Andrew Morris as chief executive of Wembley National Stadium Limited was the opaque reporting lines within the Football Association. WNSL's board ultimately considered his appointment unnecessary but Morris was also uncomfortable that he had no idea who his ultimate boss would be when Brian Barwick is replaced in January. The FA insists the problem will not recur with the World Cup 2018 bid even though it is two weeks into the process of recruiting a chief executive, chief operating officer, technical director and director of communications for the bid company. It claims that because the FA's chairman, Lord Triesman, also chairs the bid company the reporting lines are clear and that headhunters will reassure candidates accordingly.</p> <h2>Age concern</h2> <p>An attempt by the FA council's septuagenarians to overturn a rule enforcing retirement at the age of 75 was defeated yesterday. It was introduced in the 1990s but ageing blazers had called on the FA to amend its rules in the wake of age discrimination legislation. With only 34 votes in favour of the motion and 53 against, however, it was lost.</p> <h2>Cricket pleads its case</h2> <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive, David Collier, yesterday led a four-man delegation on a whirlwind tour of Brussels and met Michal Krejza, the head of the sports unit at the European Commission. Collier emphasised that English cricket is now a major player with TV revenues of \u00a3300m over four years and that the EC's discussions over the sports white paper last year had been focused on football, so the outcomes did not suit all sports. Collier and his colleagues went on to an afternoon meeting with the sports group of the European parliament, whose secretary is the influential Conservative MEP Chris Heaton-Harris.</p> <h2>The lady's not for turning</h2> <p>Arsenal fans concerned about whether Lady Nina Bracewell-Smith - holder of 15.9% of the club's shares and said to be the most likely to sell to a hostile bidder - might be wobbly may be reassured by hearing about her role in recruiting a chief executive. She was on the first interview panel, after which Celtic's Peter Lawwell and Vodafone's Paul Donovan emerged as the two candidates - Lawwell is expected to get the job tomorrow. Stan Kroenke, the American billionaire who has a 12.38% stake, will reportedly be invited to join the board.</p>",
  "<p>Last weekend, a 12-year-old boy was killed when the quad bike he was riding, on land in Wiltshire owned by his parents, flipped over and landed on top of him. This was just the latest in a string of accidents involving quad bikes, or all-terrain vehicles (ATVs). Last month, two British tourists - one on holiday in New Zealand, the other in Greece - were killed after losing control of their quad bikes. Late last year, a seven-year-old girl was killed in a collision after riding her quad bike - a Christmas present - on the road (illegal for anyone under 16). In recent years, rock star Ozzy Osbourne and comedian Rik Mayall were almost killed after coming off their ATVs.</p> <p>Ten years ago, 1,200 patients were admitted to hospital in the UK after quad bike accidents. By 2002 - the last year for which data is available - the figure was more than 4,200. \"Like any piece of machinery, it's not the quad bike that is dangerous, it's the way it's handled,\" says Roger Vincent, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. Serious injuries are rare when quad bikes are used by people who could be expected to have undergone training - for instance, farmers, foresters, gamekeepers and even soldiers in Afghanistan, who are about to receive a shipment of ATVs. \"In a leisure setting, it's very different,\" says Vincent. \"People should think twice before buying a quad bike, particularly if it's for children. If they do, it's in their interest to get training.\" </p> <p>The road safety charity Brake advises that children should not be allowed to ride a quad bike, even on private land, because they don't have the strength, skills or experience to handle a bike that can be easily overturned if not controlled properly. According to the Health and Safety Executive, most quad bike accidents involve the vehicle overturning - with excessive speed, inexperience and unsafe loads usually to blame.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama campaign yesterday went to court to block what it alleged was an attempt by Republicans in Michigan to stop people who lost their homes in the mortgage crisis from voting in November's election.</p> <p>The suit, filed in a Michigan court yesterday, is the latest sign of contention over voting procedures. Voting rights activists in several battleground states have reported an aggressive push by Republican elected officials and activists to make it harder to vote.</p> <p>In Macomb county, Michigan, a swing constituency, Republican officials for the first time tried to use America's housing crisis as a way of striking people off lists, the Obama camp told reporters yesterday. \"There is no doubt that there is an immediate threat to the voting rights of citizens in Michigan whose names could appear on a foreclosure list,\" said Bob Bauer, an Obama lawyer.</p> <p>The situation came to light last week when the Republican party chairman of Macomb county told a local newspaper he planned to draw on publicly available lists of home foreclosures to bar people from casting their vote. </p> <p>\"We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people aren't voting from those addresses,\" the official, James Carabelli, told the Michigan Messenger.</p> <p>The national Republicans later distanced the party from his comment, but other state party officials confirmed there were plans to deploy an army of poll \"challengers\" who would check voters' credentials.</p> <p>The Republicans argue that people who have lost their homes may no longer be resident at the address listed on voter records, and hence are ineligible to vote, and that their efforts are aimed at preventing voting fraud.</p> <p>Such a claim is dismissed by campaign experts, who say there is minimal fraud in American elections.</p> <p>Instead, they say the drive in Michigan to deploy poll challengers is intended to reduce turnout in poor areas and among African Americans, disproportionately affected by the housing crisis and thought to be likely Democratic voters. </p> <p>Voting rights activists say they have already found a much more aggressive attempt by Republicans this election season to try to strike people off voting lists.</p> <p>\"I think that certainly the Republicans seem to be much more out front about how they are going to challenge people's right to vote,\" said Gerald Hebert, director of the nonpartisan campaign legal centre. \"What we are seeing this time around is more of a broad-based effort, and we are also seeing the Republicans being much more assertive and bold in their announcements and not necessarily trying to do it under the radar.\"</p> <p>Voting rights activists in Ohio and Missouri have reported attempts to use the housing crisis to try to disqualify voters. </p> <p>In Michigan, Republican state party officials had planned to mail voters whose names appeared on a list of foreclosed homes obtained from the public records office. The idea was to compile a list of people who had been forced to move homes, but had yet to update their voter registration to their new address. </p> <p>Republican party workers stationed at polling stations would then challenge such voters when they turned up on election day. </p> <p>Also in Ohio, the state Republican party filed a law suit seeking to block streamlined new regulations that make it easier for people to cast their ballot by early voting. </p> <p>In Wisconsin, meanwhile, the state's Republican attorney general has gone to court to try to compel poll workers to match voters' names against driving licence records. </p> <p>Florida, which has a Republican governor, also moved last week to require poll workers to check voters' names against a government database. </p> <p>The stated rationale of all these moves is prevention of voter fraud, although organisations which study elections say such fraud is a minimal risk. </p> <p>The effort received a boost last April when the US supreme court ruled that states were entitled to require voters to present a state-issued photo ID such as a driving licence at the polls.</p> <p>Civil rights organisations argued that the requirement discriminates against the poor and the elderly, who often do not have driving licences because they cannot afford a car.</p> <p>More than 20 states now require voters to show ID at the polls, and there have been a series of recent reports about elderly people losing their right to vote.</p>",
  "<p>What western intelligence and military officials call the most dangerous part of the world has reached a critical juncture \u2013 to use the recently fashionable phrase, a tipping point.</p> <p>Though US and Nato forces are not losing the battle against Taliban and other insurgent fighters in Afghanistan, they are not <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/16/libdemconference.liberaldemocrats\">winning it</a> either. Stalemate is a word used by top military commanders. First-hand observers of the scene say it could go either way, it is in the balance.</p> <p>The Taliban and their fellow insurgents are expanding their control over the country, including areas around the capital, Kabul, according to these close observers who do not want to be named because of the positions they hold.</p> <p>There are not enough foreign troops on the ground to achieve their mission; bombing their way out of trouble is <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD937QRFO0\">counter-productive</a>; senior members of the Karzai government and the police force are corrupt; the Taliban and the other insurgents get rich through the opium trade and by protection rackets that allow convoys taking fuel to Nato troops get to their destination. And more and more insurgents are being supplied, and seek refuge, across the border in Pakistan's tribal areas.</p> <p>In response to this last development, George Bush issued a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/usforeignpolicy.usa\">not-so-secret order</a> enabling US special forces to cross the border and attack al-Qaida and others suspected of terrorism or insurgency. For the first time this month, the US admitted sending over grounds troops into Pakistan, though reports that US forces were repulsed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/pakistan.afghanistan\">by Pakistani soldiers</a> at the border on Monday remain confused; not least, one suspects, because of the sensitivity surrounding the whole issue. <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hkiMxbHNH0BqgpWA2ZG6VD6wVTmAD937T6GG0\">Unsurprisingly</a>, Pakistan says its <a href=\"http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52826&amp;Itemid=2\">sovereignty</a> must be protected even though its government has no control over the tribal areas.</p> <p>It is, indeed, a crucial time.

  "<p>If David Cameron can manage the nation's finances as well as his own, we'll be quids in. Our PM apparent is himself the best part of \u00a320,000 richer, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4754045.ece\">the deal he cut</a> with his interviewer-biographer, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/dylan-jones/\">Dylan Jones</a>, for the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/politics\">Cameron on Cameron</a>.<br> Biographers across the land, from Michael Holroyd (praise be upon his name) down to Jordan's ghostwriters, will have two responses. First, outrage: Jones's book is a disgrace to the noble craft of life-writing; and that 20 grand the most despicable reward since the 20 pieces of silver. Second, curiosity: who's Dave's agent, and does he have any space on his client list? Cameron on Cameron is, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/08/30/bocam130.xml\">by general agreement</a>, not one of the great <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/29/biography.artsandhumanities\">blackwashes</a> of our time. The 2008 award would surely have to go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/13/biography.features\">Patrick French's biography of VS Naipaul</a>. Nor, by general agreement, does Cameron on Cameron cut deep into its subject. \"Fluff\" is the general verdict. Whitewashed fluff.<br> My guess is that the contract arrangements between Cameron and \"Boswell\" Jones went a clause or two beyond cash remuneration. I would bet that Cameron and his agent secured \"final cut\" privileges and \"rights of veto\". In other words, it's tainted meat, biographically.  It's hard to believe that Cameron urgently needed 20 large \u2013 small change in his station of life. William Hague gets that for an after-dinner speech. The money signified his absolute control over versions of the Cameron private life that the public will never be permitted to see. It's in line with the famously suppressed Bullingdon toffs photograph. We don't know much about Tory policies, but image control is clearly going to be shit-hot. Independence in biography is in shorter supply than the reading public imagines. Lucky are those whose subjects say (as did Samuel Beckett to his young biographer, Deirdre Bair), \"I shall neither help you nor hinder you.\" More common is the experience of Peter Ackroyd, author of what is still the best biography of TS Eliot, who was hindered from seeing any unpublished materials and told if he quoted so much as a syllable, he'd be injuncted. It's common enough for biographers to have to pay estates for access to literary remains (those treasures in the attic), and for permission to quote copyright material. When I wrote my biography of Stephen Spender, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/09/biography.features\">royally shat on by the Observer reviewer</a>, damn him, for what he unkindly called its \"lickspittle obsequiousness\", I had to shell out 30% of my royalties. As it happened, I was glad to do so. I suspect that Ackroyd would have been, as well, with Eliot. Most biographers would happily lick spittle, or cough up painful quantities of dosh, to get a look at the stuff in the attic (read Henry James's The Aspern Papers for the lengths to which we'll go). Most biographical meat has a bit of taint about it. If, that is, it actually gets to the meat.<br> What is interesting about the Cameron case is that it takes traditional spittle-licking a step further. What he was saying to the biography-writing world was: \"How much am I bid for myself? Not my literary remains, but <em>me</em>.\" Let's hope that, like <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/542252.stm\">Neil Hamilton</a>, he got his answer in brown envelopes.</p>",

Democrats say the increasingly dire financial news will pull voters' attention from Sarah Palin and McCain attacks on Obama and toward economic issues.</p> <p>Jim Kessler, vice president of policy for centrist Democratic research group Third Way, said Obama should continue to remind voters that McCain subscribes to the Republican notion that, \"We need to let business alone and let business figure it out\".</p> <p>McCain has run as a Washington reformer who's fought to slash government spending, but has acknowledged that he is not strong on economic issues. Kessler said McCain does not seem comfortable talking about them, and also said the crisis \"takes the lustre\" off Palin.</p> <p>\"Palin is just a rank amateur on this stuff, he said. \"People aren't looking for someone who can skin a moose at this moment.\"</p> <p>Obama said borrowers should be subject to closer federal oversight. He called for stronger capital requirements for complex financial instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and other derivatives, and said mortgage brokers should be subject to the same regulatory guidelines as commercial banks.</p> <p>He would also \"streamline\" the US regulatory framework to end prevent agencies from overlapping and competing with one another, and pledged to crack down on manipulation of US securities markets.</p> <p>But today Obama focused on shooting holes in McCain's pledges to clean up Wall Street, noting that the Arizonan had long described himself as a proponent of deregulation.</p> <p>\"John McCain's newfound support for regulation bears no resemblance to his scornful attitude towards oversight and enforcement,\" he said. \"John McCain cannot be trusted to re-establish proper oversight of our financial markets for one simple reason: he has shown time and again that he does not believe in it.\"</p> <p>McCain's economic plan relies largely on making permanent George Bush's first-term tax cuts, cutting corporate and other taxes, and on eliminating congressional \"earmark\" spending that totals about 1% of the US budget.</p>",
  "<p>It is voter registration day on the campus of Kutztown university in Pennsylvania and a small but dogged group of students are trying to persuade classmates to sign up for the November presidential election. Decades ago they might have done so through bribery or, failing that, the fist; but these days the preferred method is humour.</p> <p>\"Voting is sexy and easy - register now!\" says a poster on the wall, alongside a pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey panel which students play blindfolded.</p> <p>Ostensibly, the voter drive is non-partisan, but it is clear from flyers on the table this group backs Barack Obama. They are part of the Students4Obama movement that has swept through more than 700 campuses across America in a revival of youth engagement that could be decisive on polling day.</p> <p>While the battle for the White House appears to be tightening, the campus remains one place where Obama can still expect overwhelming support. His dominance among young voters is clear in Kutztown, a state university that draws its students from across Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York.</p> <p>Obama supporters in Kutztown are organised through a cyber club on the social-networking site Facebook, which boasts 957 members. They hold regular rallies and parties, hand out leaflets countering the negative ads put out by the McCain campaign, and gently browbeat their fellows into signing up to vote. \"I believe Obama's genuine,\" says Erika Reinhard, 22, who devotes up to six hours a week on the campaign. \"He promises to reunite the country, and that's what we need.\"</p> <p>By contrast, there can be few positions in politics lonelier than that of the Republican student organiser. Zac Roberts, 21, is president of the Kutztown university body which boasts a membership of barely 30 out of 10,000 students and is thoroughly out-gunned by their Democratic rivals. Asked about the Republican Facebook group, he replies: \"That's a good idea. I might set one up.\"</p> <p>Such disparities are replicated among Pennsylvania's 780,000 student population, and in campuses throughout the US. It is highlighted by the work of Harvard University's Institute of Politics, which tracked the behaviour of young voters for the past eight years.</p> <p>It shows that while John Kerry enjoyed a 13-point lead on George Bush among 18- to 24-year-olds at this stage in the 2004 election, Obama is 23 points ahead of John McCain. The institute's researchers have found exceptional levels this year of engagement among the young, with 62% of young voters reporting that they were excited about the election and more than two-thirds saying they were definitely, or probably, intending to vote.</p> <p>It was not ever thus. When the Harvard project began in 2000, it found a mood among students that was apathetic, as reflected in a dismal turnout among 18- to 24-year-olds of 30% - well below the figure for all ages of 51%.</p> <p>Then came 9/11, a catastrophe that changed everything, says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard institute. \"There was a massive change in attitude, especially among young people, towards politics being important in their lives.\"</p> <p>The transformation was well under way before Obama hit the headlines. Della Volpe sees it as a profound generational shift among what many analysts call the \"millennial generation\" - those born in the 1980s and 90s and now reaching a political coming of age.</p> <p>He points out that this generation accounts for a quarter of Americans and is the largest in history - bigger, even, than the baby boomers. As such, Della Volpe is convinced it is large enough and enthusiastic enough to hold the balance of power in November.</p> <p>Peter Levine, who heads Circle, a nonpartisan research body at Tufts university that studies political engagement among young voters, traces the shift to a growing optimism. The deep distrust in politicians found among the so-called Generation X of the mid-60s and 70s, and their pessimism in their ability to influence affairs, has given way to renewed faith in politics as a force for good. Levine says: \"That makes them more motivated to support a candidate, as otherwise why bother? And it also has a fit with Obama, as he stands for making things better.\"</p> <p>Though the generational shift predated him, Obama has expropriated it as his own. Not only is his message of hope tailored to attract the young, but he has also constructed a campaign that talks their language.</p> <p>Howard Dean set a precedent in this regard with his primary run in 2004, in which he launched Meetup, an online campaign that drove thousands of first-time voters into his camp. The Obama campaign has built on that experience directly - its new-media director, Joe Rospars, cut his political teeth with the Dean campaign.</p> <p>Facebook tells the story. As of Tuesday, Obama had 1,847,187 Facebook friends. McCain had 335,528. On top of that, the campaign has created platforms across numerous internet-networking sites, from Twitter to Faithbase and BlackPlanet. The beauty of the approach is that it is bottom up rather than top down, allowing young people to run their own Obama-supporting groups unfettered by central control.</p> <p>The technique has unleashed huge energy in the process at relatively little cost. Studies have shown that while it costs $60 to mobilise one voter through direct mail, and $30 through phone banking, it costs only $1.56 through cyberspace tools such as social networking sites, text-messaging and email.</p> <p>The impact was visible in the primaries and caucuses, where 7 million voters under 30 turned out, helping to trounce the hopes of Hillary Clinton by voting for Obama in a ratio of four to one. The impact is also visible in Kutztown, where the student Obama group stages events with only minimal contact with the official Democratic campaign.</p> <p>It's not an entirely painless business, nor one devoid of anxiety. Erika Reinhard says she has found it harder since the summer break to get other students \"fired up\", as Obama would put it, about his candidacy. A sense of urgency has dissipated which the group is scrambling to reignite. \"A lot of people are supporting Obama, but I'm not sure they will make it to the polling booth.\"</p> <p>Her anxieties have some grounding. According to Circle, young people aged 18 to 29 are the most likely group to remain undecided about their voting intentions until election day.</p> <p>But the degree of jitters that remains on Obama's side is insufficient to cheer up Zac Roberts as he contemplates electoral oblivion for McCain, at least on this campus. \"Students are getting politically engaged again,\" he says mournfully. \"Young people don't understand what they are talking about, and I would rather they just didn't get involved.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>Forces from Hamas, the Islamist movement in control of Gaza, attacked a compound belonging to a powerful criminal gang today in a heavy street battle that left 11 dead, including a baby boy.</p> <p>The fighting began yesterday when a Hamas policeman was killed with a shot to the head while Hamas forces were trying to arrest a wanted member of the Doghmush clan inside the headquarters of the Gaza municipality. After the shooting, Hamas mounted a major raid on the clan in al-Sabra in eastern Gaza.</p> <p>The attack lasted until dawn today, with heavy fighting in the streets of the city. Another Hamas policeman was killed along with 10 members of the clan, all young men apart from two children, a boy aged one and a 16-year-old, according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. A further 42 people were injured.</p> <p>Hamas said its forces had been involved in an operation against \"fugitives\".</p> <p>It marked one of the heaviest days of fighting in Gaza for several weeks and was part of a long-running attempt by Hamas to challenge some of the powerful gangs in Gaza, of which the Doghmush is perhaps the most dangerous. The clan is believed to have been responsible last year for the kidnap of Alan Johnston, the BBC journalist held in Gaza for nearly four months before being freed unhurt. The Doghmush is also thought to have links to newly emerging Islamist groups in Gaza, including one calling itself the Army of Islam.</p> <p>Some in the Doghmush have been allied to Fatah, the movement led by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank, while others are close to Hamas and are believed to have taken part in the capture of an Israeli soldier near Gaza two years ago. The soldier, Gilad Shalit, is still being held.</p> <p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights called for an investigation into the incident and said it was looking into reports that after the first Hamas police officer was killed yesterday, the original Doghmush suspect, Jameel Doghmush, was taken to the policeman's home and shot dead by several gunmen in an apparent act of revenge.</p> <p>Today's attack follows an incident in early August when 11 people were killed as Hamas confronted another powerful Gaza clan linked to the rival Fatah movement.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> suffered a fresh blow today when Scotland Office minister David Cairns resigned because of his lack of confidence in the prime minister.</p> <p>Cairns is the second member of the government to resign within a week over concerns that Brown is leading Labour to electoral disaster.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister has accepted David Cairns's resignation. The exercise of government demands collective responsibility.\"</p> <p>No 10 will now be anxiously waiting to see whether other ministers follow Cairns, whose resignation comes four days before the start of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour's annual conference</a>. At least two other ministers of state are thought to be considering their position.</p> <p>Cairns announced his resignation about five hours after Labour's national executive committee said that it would not be issuing leadership nomination papers to MPs. In his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/16/labour.labourleadership\">resignation letter</a>, Cairns said he had decided to quit because it was \"hardly credible\" for the party to continue to deny that leadership had become an issue.</p> <p>Cairns said he had argued against colleagues seeking nomination forms as this would only lead to \"division and wrangling\" - but they went ahead and the current crisis began, to his \"dismay\".</p> <p>But it was the response to this that had caused him most unhappiness, Cairns continued.</p> <p>\"Rather than seizing the opportunity to open out to the broader party membership a discussion that is being held in private, our response as a government has been to suggest that these were the actions of a tiny number of disaffected people who have taken leave of their senses, are part of some larger plot and are entirely unrepresentative of the PLP,\" he said.</p> <p>\"These were among the more charitable responses. I do not believe any of these things to be the case, though I understand the frustration of those good comrades who hold a different point of view.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"In any event the debate is now on. The issue of leadership and direction are being discussed and argued over, and to go on denying it is hardly credible. I wish it were otherwise.</p> <p>\"To that end I believe that the time has come to take the bull by the horns and allow a leadership debate to run its course.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"I know that it is incompatible to hold this view and to remain a serving minister, and although it had not been my intention to resign, I have reluctantly concluded that it is the only honourable course of action left open.\"</p> <p>In a subsequent interview with the BBC, Cairns said he was \"not part of any plot\" and that he did not know if any other ministers would be resigning.</p> <p>He also said that he was somebody who believed that the \"the worst day of a Labour government is better than the best day of a Tory government\". He said he felt \"pretty wretched\" about the situation he was in.</p> <p>Brown's critics will try to use the party's conference in Manchester, which starts on Saturday, to maximise pressure on the prime minister. Although they accept they are not in a position to force him out themselves, they hope to persuade cabinet ministers that Brown cannot be allowed to continue as leader.</p> <p>But today cabinet ministers rallied behind Brown. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">collapse of Lehman Brothers</a> and the resulting crisis in the world economy seem to have persuaded some ministers that a leadership election now would be hard to justify.</p> <p>After Cairns was named by the media this morning as being poised to quit, government officials were unable to say for the next few hours whether he would be staying or going.</p> <p>But this afternoon Downing Street announced that Cairns, who was well regarded in Labour circles as a hard-working and efficient minister, had quit. Attempts by colleagues during the day to persuade him to stay did not succeed.</p> <p>Cairns, a former Catholic priest, became an MP in 2001. To allow him to be elected to parliament, the government had to pass legislation repealing the ban on Catholic priests sitting in parliament.</p> <p>Before becoming an MP, Cairns used to work as a research assistant to Siobhain McDonagh, the Labour MP who resigned as a whip on Friday after announcing that she wanted a leadership election. Her decision has prompted other MPs to publicly criticise Brown's leadership over the last five days.</p> <p>Two of the other critics, Barry Gardiner and Joan Ryan, both gave up unpaid posts, as a forestry envoy and a Labour vice-chair respectively, after joining calls for a leadership election.</p> <p>Cairns's resignation came on a day when <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/16/bankofenglandgovernor.gordonbrown\">the prime minister met the Bank of England governor Mervyn King</a> in Downing Street to discuss the crisis facing the world's financial markets.</p> <p>Within the cabinet, the world financial situation seems to have strengthened support for Brown.</p> <p>Speaking two hours before Cairns's resignation was confirmed, Jack Straw, the justice secretary, told the BBC's World at One that Brown was the same as he was when he was elected with the overwhelming support of the Labour party last year, except that he was more experienced, \"which is a good thing\".</p> <p>Straw said that, although he understood why Labour MPs were frustrated with the party's standing in the polls, the \"mother and father\" of the party's plight was the world economy.</p> <p>\"I'm absolutely clear Gordon Brown is the man with the experience and the intellect and the strategy to lead us through these current difficulties in the United Kingdom,\" Straw said.</p> <p>After the cabinet meeting, Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, told reporters that the leadership issue had not been discussed.</p> <p>\"Our concern is to make sure that we keep the economy strong, make sure that we keep as many people as possible in work and we've still got record high levels of employment, to make sure that we keep inflation down.</p> <p>\"This is what we've been elected to government to do, this is what Labour party members in this country expect us to do,\" she said.</p> <p>This morning, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, the chancellor, delivered a similar message. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, at a time of \"unprecedented turbulence\" in the world economy, the public would expect the party to be concentrating its efforts on sorting out the problems facing Britain.</p> <p>At least 12 Labour rebels have written to the party asking for leadership nomination papers to be sent to MPs ahead of next week's conference. They believe they are entitled to receive them under party rules.</p> <p>But, at the start of today's meeting of the NEC, the party issued a statement saying the NEC had ruled out such a request.</p> <p>A statement released by the Labour party from Dianne Hayter, the chair of the NEC, said: \"The Labour party national executive committee is in agreement that internal procedural debates will not divert the Labour party from our mission of building a fairer Britain and helping people through these challenging times.</p> <p>\"A leadership election when in government can only be held if requested by a majority of party conference on a card vote.</p> <p>\"Only Labour MPs can trigger the process and the NEC is confident that most MPs know their responsibilities under the rules.\"</p> <p>Janet Anderson, a member of the NEC and a former minister, had been expected to raise the issue at the meeting. But Anderson, who has also spoken out against Brown's leadership, decided not to attend the meeting.</p> <p>Cairns had been tipped for a leading role in Labour's defence of its seat in the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a>, working as senior spokesman and a campaign strategist alongside the Labour MP and whip Frank Roy.</p> <p>He had the same task during the party's ill-fated attempt to hold Glasgow East in July.</p> <p>Despite losing to the SNP, both Cairns and Roy were expected to take up the same duties when the Glenrothes byelection begins, implying that Gordon Brown was still confident of their abilities.</p> <p>Scottish Labour sources were surprised by reports this morning that he was poised to resign. One admitted that Cairns had not yet visited the constituency, but added: \"He's incredibly loyal and works incredibly hard, and gives more to the party than his job as a minister.\"</p> <p>As Scotland Office minister, Cairns also had a prominent role leading for the UK government in Scottish affairs as his boss, Scottish secretary Des Browne, is in effect part-time given his other job as defence secretary.</p> <p>Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, said: \"The disintegration of the UK Labour government may well be reaching the Scotland Office, and it is very hard to see how David Cairns can remain in post.</p> <p>\"The UK government is now devoid of all credibility; Labour have become a laughing stock at the very moment the international financial crisis demands a strong response and firm leadership.</p> <p>\"But all Labour can do is fight like ferrets in a sack, which is a disgraceful dereliction of responsibility in these difficult economic times.\"</p> <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, the former Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"As long as Gordon Brown has his cabinet behind him, his position is just about tenable. But if Gordon Brown were to lose the Glenrothes byelection, that would prove to be something of a watershed.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday September 17 2008. We named the governor of the Bank of England as Eddie George. It is now Mervyn King. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>American shoppers will soon be able to look at a cut of meat or a pound of hamburger and see something they've never seen before - a label that says where the meat came from.</p> <p>Starting September 30, food manufacturers and grocery stores have to comply with a new federal law that requires \"Country of Origin Labeling,\" or Cool, on beef, pork, chicken and lamb.</p> <p>The new labels will tell consumers whether their food came from animals raised in the US or another country. The law also covers perishable items, such as fruits and vegetables and a variety of nuts.</p> <p>Some say this will enable consumers to avoid food that, for example, comes from countries that they have heard have food safety problems. It also will allow consumers to stick to American-grown food, if that is their preference.</p> <p>Because of the complexities of the livestock industry, some product labels may list multiple countries. That's especially true of ground beef, since some meat processors combine cuts from a number of countries to make ground meat and hamburger patties.</p> <p>Food safety groups have hailed Cool as a necessary step toward broader consumer education and buying choices. But now they complain that the US department of agriculture has defined it as narrowly as possible. For example, they say, the agency has defined a host of foods as processed, such as mixed frozen vegetables, which exempts them from the new law. \"When they finalized this rule, they bent over backward to make as few things be covered as possible,\" said Michael Hansen, a senior staff scientist with Consumers Union. \"There are giant, giant loopholes in the law.\"</p> <p>Advocates say many in the meat industry have fought the new labelling law because they don't want consumers to know that they are buying imported hamburger and beef cuts. The USDA also stood against Cool, according to Lloyd Day, head of the agency's agricultural marketing service, because of its projected impact on consumers and its estimated cost to the food industry: $2.5 billion (\u00a31.4 billion) in the first year.</p> <p>But Congress has decreed that Cool will take effect on September 30, so the debate over its merits is largely over. Now the industry is bracing for Cool's impact.</p> <p>\"We don't know exactly how it's all going to work,\" said Colin Woodall, who follows the issue for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. \"And we won't know until it's fully up and running.\"</p> <p>In an era of bar codes and tracking numbers, Cool might seem simple to enact. For a few food manufacturers, it will be.<br>\"There's no change for me, because all of my ground beef has always carried the born-and-raised-in-the-USA label because I track everything,\" said Mike Callicrate, who operates Ranch Foods Direct in Colorado Springs, Colorado. </p> <p>But getting Cool enacted has in fact been a complicated six-year effort. Congress first passed Cool in 2002, but the bill ran into heavy political resistance from food companies and the government itself. The USDA and Congress sided with food manufacturers who said the law would be too costly to enact, and Cool was delayed. By 2005, only the portion of Cool pertaining to fish and seafood was in effect.<br>The idea gained momentum, though, following a string of food-borne illness outbreaks, new concerns over the safety of food imports and some of the largest meat recalls in history.</p> <p>One of the biggest disagreements over the law's fine points is what constitutes a processed food item. The agriculture industry tried to clarify this with some guidelines issued in August. A bag of imported frozen peas, for instance, must list its country of origin under Cool. But a bag of peas mixed with carrots is considered processed, and does not.</p> <p>\"It's considered processed if it's combined with one other ingredient,\" said Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food &amp; Water Watch. \"We think they're being incredibly broad.\"</p> <p>The USDA's Day said that pre-packaged imported foods like peas and carrots have to carry an origin label. But if vegetables are imported in bulk and the mixed together by a US company, then they are considered processed and don't need one.</p> <p>Another controversy involves imported livestock. Under Cool, meat derived from cattle imported into the United States for immediate slaughter can bear a label that states it's a product of its origin country and the United States, even though the animal was raised entirely outside the US.</p> <p>Some fear that meat packers who slaughter both imported and domestic cattle won't bother with specific labels, and instead will apply the same label to both.</p>",
  "<p>Liberalism has always been tugged between two conflicting ideological traditions, libertarianism and social reform. The Liberal party almost from its foundation until its nadir in the 1950s suffered splits, breakaways and defections from its economic liberals to the Conservatives and its radicals and reformers to Labour. None of these actually resolved the problem, and even in the 1950s the old conflicts were being played out in Lilliputian form.</p> <p>A new pressure group, <a href=\"http://www.liberal-vision.org/\">Liberal Vision</a>, is interested in restarting the debate and has done it in the provocative form of an index of how liberal or not the 63 Lib Dem MPs are on various \"lifestyle freedoms\", measuring their votes on measures concerning the smoking ban, gambling and licensing, and who signed which Early Day Motion on various subjects. The index was launched at a lively fringe meeting in Bournemouth, at which one of the speakers was <a href=\"http://gavinwebb.co.uk/gavinwebb/\">Gavin Webb</a>, a rebellious libertarian Lib Dem councillor from Stoke-on-Trent. Webb was introduced as having liberal views on drugs, prostitution, handguns and drink driving (hopefully not all at the same time). There are no out-and-out libertarians like Webb in the parliamentary party, but the liberal index is still quite intriguing and revealing.</p> <p>The top and bottom scoring MPs for liberality on lifestyle issues illustrate a curious fact of political life. Lembit \u00d6pik is the most \"liberal\" of the lot, but represents Montgomeryshire in mid Wales. The constituency has been one of the most consistently Liberal in the land, with only one Tory lapse (in 1979) in the last century. Despite a small influx of downsizing professionals and pot-smoking self-sufficient types, Montgomeryshire embodies the chapel-going, rural traditional heritage of the party. Other seats that consistently vote for the most liberal of the three main parties are also among the most conservative in their own social mores, such as Orkney and Shetland, the Highlands and Aberdeenshire, and to some extent Cornwall. The second and third most liberal, David Laws and Paul Keetch, represent Yeovil and Hereford, provincial towns not usually associated with letting it all hang out. Only at fourth place, with David Howarth of Cambridge, do we have a stereotypical liberal constituency.</p> <p>The lowest score in the liberal index went to John Leech, who represents Manchester Withington. Withington is a classic example of a liberal, academic suburb. I would not be surprised if, despite Leech favouring a higher classification for the substance, Withington has a higher than average cannabis intake, and probably fair trade, organically grown cannabis at that. MPs' views, perhaps particularly on these lifestyle liberal issues, are quirky, personal and often incongruous with their constituencies. Next lowest come three ex-Labour MPs, Mike Hancock, Vince Cable and Bob Russell, and leftwing Liberals such as Paul Holmes and John Pugh. Perhaps this means that MPs' personalities are less important in deciding elections than they like to believe. Perhaps, also, voters tend to see these lifestyle liberties as being secondary to the principal questions of politics. Many voters who want these lifestyle choices just do it anyway, whatever the law says, and get away with it. Laws against brothels, pornography and cannabis are enforced in a rather liberal way, with the police usually taking action only in cases which clearly break the harm principle (such as people trafficking, child porn or gangsterism). The articulate and careful middle classes can already opt out, although it is unlikely that enforcing a law in a socially unequal way is a satisfactory way of dealing with lifestyle issues.</p> <p>However, the view of Liberal Vision's Mark Littlewood that some votes can be won on lifestyle liberalism is probably correct, even if the market for this sort of politics is smaller than Littlewood would like. There is potential in being the only large party that does not insist on telling people how to live their lives and which pleasures are officially licensed and which are punished. This has the potential to build a bridge between the old liberal left electorate and the new, more rightwing liberal types the party is wooing. </p> <p>However, as the Liberal Vision meeting showed, what seems at first like a simple clear principle can end up being a matter of balance and compromise. Nearly every liberal accepts John Stuart Mill's principle that activities that do not harm anyone else should not be restricted, but the question is always what counts as harm to others. The <a href=\"http://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk/\">ban on smoking</a> in public places is a particularly clear example of these differing interpretations and standards. Personal freedom will define and divide liberals long into the future.<br></p>",
  "<p><strong>BORDEAUX BLANC AND A PLONKER</strong></p> <p>Now that Rafa Benitez appears to have completed his conversion of erstwhile prolific striker Robbie Keane into Dirk Kuyt 2.0, Liverpool boast a litter of frantic frontmen who yip and yap around the park like toothless terriers. Oddly, that's not only good news for fans of fresh-air swipes and comically inopportune falls, it's also a boon for the Reds' immediate Big Cup hopes - because the relentless peskiness of the likes of Kuyt and Keane is precisely what could enable Liverpool to repeat last season's 4-0 mauling of Marseille at the Velodrome tonight.</p> <p>By contrast, failure to fluster the French, for whom pocket genius Mathieu Valbuena and <a href=\"http://d.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/ng/sp/empics/20080305/11/3372894710-soccer-uefa-champions-league-first-knockout-round-second-leg-manchester.jpg \">Tracy Emin lookalike Hatem Ben Arfa</a> are expected to feature after missing the weekend's draw with Bordeaux, would allow OM to showcase the canny passing and movement that had previously bewildered Benitez at Anfield (not least because Bolo Zenden was central to it). \"They are stronger than last season,\" blubbed Benitez, presumably after learning that Djinkin' Djibril Cisse has left and Zenden's no longer a regular starter. \"It's going to be difficult for us because they are well organised, have a lot of talent and a super mentality, plus they score an awful lot of goals,\" continued Benitez, presumably after learning that Djinkin' Djibril has etc and so on.</p> <p>Bordeaux, meanwhile, will be at Stamford Bridge, provided their team bus is not deliberately smashed off course by England's Brave John Terry while Ricardo Carvalho jogs pointlessly in the background.

  "<p>At least eight people have been killed in a grenade attack on a crowd celebrating Mexican independence in the city of Morelia.</p> <p>The attack, in which dozens were injured, could signal a new stage in the country's already vicious drug wars. </p> <p>Two explosions ripped through the crowd of around 30,000 people minutes after they listened to the local governor giving the traditional Grito, or cry of independence.</p> <p>The authorities did not immediately identify who they thought was to blame, but many observers assumed the involvement of Mexico's drug cartels. </p> <p>While the country's various leftwing guerrilla groups traditionally shy away from killings, the cartels are deeply immersed in inter-gang wars for the control of trafficking routes, local markets and production. </p> <p>They are also battling against a nationwide military-led offensive, aimed at reining them in, which began in Michoacan, the central state, of which Morelia is the capital, almost two years ago. </p> <p>Launched by the president, Felipe Calderon, who comes from Michoacan, the offensive has so far made the violence worse with close to 3,000 people having been killed in drug-related violence so far this year. </p> <p>Last Friday, 24 bodies were found dumped close to the capital less than two weeks after 12 decapitated bodies were found near the normally tranquil southern city of Merida. </p> <p>Nevertheless last night's attack on a crowd of families, many of them with small children, would be a major scaling up of the traffickers' challenge to the government. They have so far focused on attacking rivals or members of the security forces. </p> <p>A decision to attack the Morelia festivities would be about as charged a message as it would be possible to send in deeply nationalistic Mexico, where similar celebrations take place in the main squares of every city and town. </p> <p>As the grenades were exploding in his home state, Calderon was watching the fireworks over the capital's Zocalo plaza. </p> <p>He used his speech at the start of yesterday's military parade through the capital, another tradition that took place under heightened emergency security measures this year, to condemn the attackers as \"cowards\" and \"traitors.\" </p> <p>Calling for unity across the ideological spectrum he added: \"These criminals are condemned to fail because they will have all of Mexico against them.\"</p>",

  "<p>Cuba has rejected a $5m (\u00a32.8m) offer for relief assistance from Washington, saying it cannot accept help from a country with an economic embargo against it, and instead renewed its request to allow the communist country to make purchases with credit.</p> <p>In a statement made public yesterday, the Cuban government asked Washington for a six-month reprieve on embargo rules that prohibit the communist country from making purchases from American companies, saying devastation from hurricanes Gustav and Ike make it critical.</p> <p>Washington and Havana have been embroiled in a diplomatic dispute over hurricane aid since Hurricane Gustav smashed into western Cuba on August 30. </p> <p>Washington offered $100,000 and a humanitarian assessment team, and the Cuban foreign ministry answered by saying what it needed was purchasing credits.</p> <p>Havana sent a second, more harshly worded note last week when Washington made the same offer after Hurricane Ike devastated eastern Cuba. </p> <p>The statement released Thursday called US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez a hypocrite, and said US diplomats were cynical liars.</p> <p>Washington's decision to limit the offer to $100,000 was criticised in some circles, who noted that the US government normally spends millions in such disaster relief.</p> <p>On Saturday, US diplomats met in Washington with Cuban counterparts, and upped the offer to $5m.</p> <p>\"We regret that they have not accepted this offer,\" US state department spokeswoman Heide Bronke said. \"We are considering Cuba's request to purchase other reconstruction materials on case by case consistent with US law.\"</p> <p>US law allows Cuba to make cash agricultural purchases, but does not allow Cuba to buy with credit. Cuba's request for a six-month reprieve would likely require an act of Congress.</p> <p>Cuba's diplomatic note on Sunday, released yesterday, takes a much softer tone.</p> <p>\"The Cuban interests section in Washington wishes to communicate to the government of the United States that our country cannot accept a donation from the country that blockades us, although it is willing to purchase the indispensable materials that the North American companies export to the markets, and requests authorisation for the provision of same, as well as the credits that are normal in all commercial operations,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"If the government of the United States does not wish to do so permanently, the government of Cuba requests that at least it do so during the next six months, especially if the damage caused by hurricanes Gustav and Ike is taken into account, as well as the fact that the most dangerous months of the hurricane season are still ahead.\"</p> <p>Last week Gutierrez said the Cuban government is behind on payments to many of its creditors, and suggested that the request for credits was a pretext.</p> <p>\"Do they really want us to extend their credits?\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Until his resignation from the government, David Cairns was best known for being the only sitting MP who entered parliament after the law was changed on his behalf.</p> <p>He became Labour MP for the Scottish seat of Greenock and Inverclyde in 2001 after parliament reversed a law that prevented former Catholic priests from taking up a seat in the House of Commons.</p> <p>The government passed the House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001, just in time to allow Cairns to take up his seat.</p> <p>In the early 1990s he served as a Catholic priest for three years at churches in Scotland and London.</p> <p>During his ministry in Clapham, south London, he became increasingly politicised, describing it as \"the kind of place where the very rich and very poor live next to each other. It became clear that political action was going to be part of the solution.\"</p> <p>He left the priesthood to become a director of the Christian Socialist Movement.</p> <p>His career then followed a fairly predictable path for a would-be MP, working as a researcher for Labour MP - Siobhain McDonagh, who was sacked from the government last week for calling for a leadership contest. After McDonagh's outspoken remarks, speculation began to grow that her former researcher was among the ministers who shared her views.</p> <p>Cairns also served as a councillor on Merton council during his time as a researcher for McDonagh.</p> <p>He was elected an MP in 2001 and re-elected in 2005, when the constituency was renamed Inverclyde. Cairns, 42, has strong links with the constituency - he was born and educated there and members of his large extended family still live in the area.</p> <p>Once in parliament, Cairns worked his way up through the lowly ranks from membership of the joint committee on the consolidation of bills to parliamentary aide to Malcolm Wicks, the work and pensions minister.</p> <p>He was appointed as a parliamentary undersecretary of state in the Scotland Office by Tony Blair in 2006. Northern Ireland was briefly added to his responsibilities before he was promoted to minister of state in the Scotland Office last year.</p> <p>With a secretary of state, Des Browne, who also has responsibility for defence, Cairns took on much of the legwork in the department.</p> <p>Cairns was manager of Labour's disastrous campaign in Glasgow East, where the Scottish National party pulled off a surprise victory in July by winning what had been one of Labour's safest seats. He will not have relished the prospect of taking part in the forthcoming Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p>He is known in parliament as a genial, relaxed figure who is as popular with the media and his political opponents as he is with his own side.</p>",
  "<p>Tougher restrictions on the use of a chemical used to line food and drink cans will be demanded today following the publication of research linking it to raised heart disease, diabetes and liver abnormalities in adults.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners have long worried over the presence of bisphenol A (BPA), which 90% of people have at low levels in their bodies. </p> <p>Evidence from animal studies shows it is an endocrine disruptor which can mimic the naturally occurring hormone estrogen. Critics claim it could potentially interfere with the development of the foetus.</p> <p>Until now, there has been more speculation than evidence of its effects on humans. </p> <p>However, research by scientists at Exeter University, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, one of the world's leading medical journals, has found that adults with higher levels of bisphenol A in their bodies have higher rates of certain diseases. </p> <p>The study will step up pressure on regulatory bodies to control use of the chemical. </p> <p>In the same issue of JAMA, two leading US scientists have called for \"aggressive action\" to limit human exposure, acusing drug regulators in the US and Europe of turning a blind eye to warning signs in animal studies. </p> <p>The results of the trial will today be put before a committee of the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, which is considering what action, if any, needs to be taken.</p> <p>The research was based on data from the US, collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2004, which included 1,455 adults over 18 and under 74. </p> <p>The concentration of bisphenol A in the body was measured through a urine sample.</p> <p>Scientists found that people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes had higher concentrations of bisphenol A in their urine, even when age and sex was taken into consideration. </p> <p>Those with the highest concentrations of the chemical in their bodies had nearly three times the likelihood of heart disease of those with the least bisphenol A in their urine and 2.4 times the diabetes risk. </p> <p>People with high levels of chemical also had a higher chance of clinically abnormal levels of three liver enzymes.</p> <p>The scientists said their study showed a relationship but did not prove that bisphenol A was responsible for the higher disease levels - it is possible there could be some other factor which has not been accounted for. </p> <p>They have called for more studies to be carried out to confirm what they have found.</p> <p>Iain Lang, of the epidemiology and public health group of Exeter's Penninsula medical school, said the study was not a reason for people to stop buying canned food or plastic bottles, which are not usually labelled as containing bisphenol A.</p> <p>\"As a scientist, I would say that this is only one study,\" he said. \"I'm not changing my behaviour on the basis of this single study.\" </p> <p>Unhealthy habits, such as eating the wrong foods, smoking, drinking to excess and lack of exercise were the main causes of heart disease, he said. </p> <p>However, regulators would want to reassure themselves that there was no problem, and the FDA and European officials will be under pressure to act. </p> <p>In a JAMA editorial, Frederick vom Saal, of the University of Missouri, and John Peterson Myers of Environmental Health Sciences, in Charlottesville, Virginia, said the regulators should \"follow the recent action taken by Canadian regulatory agencies, which have declared BPA a 'toxic chemical' requiring aggressive action to limit human and environmental exposures\".</p> <p>Until now, they said, the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority have chosen to ignore warnings in spite of \"overwhelming evidence of harm from animal studies\". </p> <p>A contributory factor might be \"an aggressive disinformation campaign using techniques ('manufactured doubt') first developed by the lead, vinyl and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists.\"</p> <p>David Coggon, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southampton said that, if the findings were corroborated, there would need to be more controls on exposure to the chemical. </p> <p>\"These are preliminary but potentially important findings,\" he said. \"If low-level BPA were confirmed to cause disease, there would be a need to review controls on sources of exposure to the chemical.\"</p> <p>Richard Sharpe, a professor in the Medical Research Council Human Reproductive Sciences unit at Edinburgh University, said it was important to exclude possible alternative causes of the raised heart disease and diabetes levels. </p> <p>\"If you drink lots of high sugar canned drinks you will, over time, increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes - I think we already suspect this - and incidentally you will be exposed to more bisphenol A from the can lining.</p> <p>\"In the interests of health protection, it is obviously a priority that we design studies to provide this information before we label bisphenol A as the prime suspect,\" he said.</p>",

The fall followed a plunge of nearly 4% yesterday as markets were rocked by the demise of one of the US's biggest and most prestigious investment banks. </p> <p>Darling said earlier it was \"inevitable\" there would be turbulence in the world stock markets after the collapse of Lehman's. \"There is bound to be a bit of uncertainty,\" he told BBC Radio 4.</p> <p>\"The answer to that, of course, is that we need to ensure that, as far as we reasonably can, we get ... openness, banks declaring their positions, so that people can get certainty and therefore are more likely to put their money back into bank shares and so on.\"</p> <p>Brown's meeting with King is thought to have taken place before this morning's cabinet, which was dominated by economic issues.</p> <p>Harriet Harman, the deputy Labour leader, said afterwards that the chancellor and the prime minister would be working with the Bank and the Financial Services Authority to make sure the economy was kept \"as sound as possible\".</p> <p>She said the cabinet had not discussed demands by some backbench MPs for a leadership contest. </p>",
  "<p>For millions of people in the UK, anti-terror legislation is rather distant, its finer points discussed only by politicians, specialist lawyers and the like. We hear about attempts to introduce tough laws; we hear about new arrests, and we get on with our lives. But for my friend Hicham and me, the force of the new anti-terror legislation suddenly became a harsh reality. Our arrests have implications for the rights of individuals in Britain to read legally available open-source documents free from the fear of arrest. </p> <p>May 14 2008. A postgraduate international relations student at the University of Nottingham and a principle administrator in the modern languages department (also a former postgraduate student at the university), Rizwaan Sabir and Hicham Yezza, were arrested under section 41 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_5\">Terrorism Act 2000</a>. I type this sentence, and despite everything, I still find it difficult to comprehend the arrests. We were detained for six days, unable to see our family or friends on suspicion of being involved in the \"commission, preparation, or instigation\" of an act of terrorism. Our homes were raided and my terrified family evicted from their home. </p> <p>The operation, codenamed Minerva, was led by the West Midlands counter-terrorism unit and involved 26 police officers, forensic experts, three police raids, and thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers' money. </p> <p>After failing to find justification to detain me any longer, on day six of our ordeal, I was released without a charge, without an apology; but with a police warning against accessing an openly available, widely cited al-Qaida document considered relevant to my postgraduate research by me and my academic supervisors. I was only put under threat of future arrest, but Hicham's terrifying detention was prolonged by the authorities, under immigration charges \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/terrorism.civilliberties\">ordeal continues</a> to this very day. </p> <p>What was our offence?</p> <p>Our offence was that we had in our possession an edited version of a document referred to as the \"al-Qaida training manual\". A document freely available on the US Department of Justice website and that of the Federation of American Scientists. A document widely available elsewhere on official and unofficial internet sites, in either edited or full versions. A document purchasable in paperback from Amazon. A document I had downloaded months ago for my masters dissertation and upcoming PhD. A document a lecturer knew I was consulting. A document I had sent months ago to Hicham who was helping me draft my PhD proposal. A document many other academics and students studying terrorism will have had in their possession. A document extensively cited in books on terrorism. A bog-standard source. Nothing extraordinary or remarkable about its possession \u2013 one would think. </p> <p>Once placed under arrest in the car park of the University's Trent building, I naively thought I would be released in a few hours, that it was all a terrible misunderstanding or a sick joke. </p> <p>We were taken to Bridewell police station (a small specialised prison complex consisting of approximately 90 cells) and placed in a cell. I was informed that a warrant would soon be issued and my house would be raided. I had still not been told the reason for my arrest. </p> <p>For the suspected \"terrorists\" (Hicham and me), they had sealed off the entire second floor of the prison. We were kept in solitary confinement. Our only human contact \u2013 apart from the detention officers and my lawyer \u2013 was with a judge that smiled down on us whilst stamping an authorisation order for a further five days detention. </p> <p>For the first 12 hours I was incommunicado. For the first 2 days I was on a 24-hour watch. Two officers sat outside my open cell door, watching my every move and making notes in a custody log. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. I was too scared to pray, lest that be used against me. My property was seized, forensically examined, and my family evicted. My car was compounded and my friends and lecturers repeatedly questioned. I was photographed, fingerprinted, foot-printed and DNA-swabbed. It was the first time in my life I had felt so criminalised and degraded.</p> <p>I was interviewed once a day, except for the last day, when I sat through two mind-numbing interviews. I was asked my opinion of the training manual, whether I had used it, or was planning on using it, or whether I had disseminated it. I was asked if I had ever travelled to Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan or Turkey (obviously the lack of stamps in my passport weren't enough to convince them), whether I had ever been camping, or was planning a camping trip. I was questioned about September 11 and asked to explain what I thought of al-Qaida. The interviews got more absurd with time. I was questioned about journal articles in my bedroom from Foreign Affairs and World Politics, photographs I had taken of friends with Edinburgh Castle in the background, and questioned about cheesy pop CDs from the early 1990s \u2013 embarrassingly \u2013 discovered in my bedroom. <br> Unfettered questioning and microscopic searches for six days did not produce any evidence, and I was released without charge. The police had finally realised I was a postgraduate student studying terrorism; not a member of an al-Qaida sleeper-cell.</p> <p>Bill Rammell, the higher education minister, has made it clear, in his speeches and through his department's guidance to universities, that academic freedom is important and that it is vital that academics and students should be able to study terrorism. Nevertheless, in apparent contravention of the government guidance, the police threatened me with further detention if I used the document for my research. </p> <p>I would like to say my freedom to research had the full backing of my University authorities, but unfortunately they appear unwilling to uphold the right of their students to read and study legal, openly available documents free from the fear of arrest.<br> My feeling upon release was sheer relief and happiness; the joy of freedom and the pleasure of seeing my loved ones was something I had never encountered before. But beneath it all lay terrifying thoughts and questions; what would have happened if I had been charged? How would I have coped in a maximum-security prison? The answers to these questions still haunt me today.</p> <p>The authorities have a tough job fighting terrorism. But locking away innocent people without prior investigation (for what may soon be <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7449268.stm\">42 days</a>) to later release them without charge is certainly not the way. It is not the way to make Britain safer. It is not the way to bring a multicultural and multiracial society together. It is not the way to unit British citizens against terrorism, but it is a way of setting a very worrying precedent that might achieve just the opposite. <br> Detaining people who have actually committed a crime of which there is evidence is understandable, but detaining those against whom there is no evidence is not.</p>",

Tom Cruise in Valkyrie. The film has received funding from the German government</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of a sudden, it seems, there's something about Germany. First up, we had Tom Cruise's decision to risk incurring the wrath of the nation's anti-Scientologist brigade (which seems to constitute pretty much everyone who lives there) by shooting Valkyrie at the historic Benderblock building in Berlin. Then Quentin Tarantino decided to eschew his usual all-American tales in favour of Inglorious Bastards, set in Vichy-era France and Germany and centring on a platoon of Jewish-American soldiers parachuted behind enemy lines for a crack at the Nazis.</p> <p>While Hollywood has not been slow to turn its eye to western Europe's most prosperous nation in the past, particularly when Steven Spielberg has been involved, could there be a reason for this acceleration in interest in all things Deutsche? If there is, it would appear to be cold hard cash. <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992194.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Variety reports today</a> that the German Federal Film Fund, or DFFF, which was set up last year to attract film-makers to the country, is injecting funds into both Bastards and Roman Polanski's forthcoming Ghost, an adaptation of the Robert Harris novel starring Pierce Brosnan and Nicolas Cage.<br><br>These are just the latest foreign productions to receive cash to film in Germany. <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=features&amp;id=2895&amp;articleid=VR1117980586\">The DFFF has a total of $85m a year available to encourage film-makers,</a> and what's most interesting is that it doesn't seem to care very much if public opinion in the country is set hard against the very features it is helping to get made. Last year it awarded $7m to Bryan Singer's forthcoming Valkyrie, which is about the attempt by Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg (Cruise) to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944. All this despite the huge row about allowing a film starring a man with Scientologist beliefs to shoot in the country (Germany does not recognise the organisation as a religion and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7133867.stm\">it has been under investigation by government agencies</a>).</p> <p>Then there's Tarantino's film, set to star Brad Pitt, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0c67f62c8fff286074019b9b9f940c9c\">which has been the subject of criticism</a> due to what is seen as a somewhat glib attitude towards the horrors of the second world war and the Holocaust. Never mind, there you go, have a big fat sack of Euros.</p> <p>One wonders whether QT might have saved himself the hassle, as the DFFF also handed a record $13.2m to the Wachowski brothers for their rather ill-fated Speed Racer, not a movie with obvious Teutonic influences, but one which was shot in Potsdam and Berlin between early June and late August 2007. Hollywood seems to have got the message that Germany has money to spend, but appears oblivious to the fact that this same cash need not necessarily be spent on specifically \"German\" projects. </p> <p>Until it works that one out, expect a surfeit of films about Nazis, beer festivals, sunbed thievery, unusual facial hair and various other spurious Teutonic stereotypes to hit cinemas over the next few years.</p>",
  "<p>The commander of US forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus, today handed over control of American military operations in the country to his successor, General Raymond Odierno.</p> <p>In an elaborate ceremony in the marble-lined rotunda of one of Saddam Hussein's former palaces outside Baghdad, the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, praised the two men for stabilising the country in the past year.</p> <p>\"Darkness had descended on this land,\" Gates said. \"Merchants of chaos were gaining strength. Death was commonplace\u2026 Slowly, but inexorably, the tide began to turn. Our enemies took a fearsome beating they will not soon forget.\"</p> <p>In his remarks, Petraeus thanked his troops and hailed Odierno as \"the perfect man for the job\".</p> <p>As Odierno takes charge, Petraeus becomes the new chief of Central Command, with responsibility for US troops from the Horn of Africa to central Asia, including the conflicts in both Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>Iraq was spiralling into all-out civil war when Petraeus took over in February 2007, almost four years after Saddam was toppled by a US-led invasion.</p> <p>Since late last year, violence has fallen to a four-year low. Much of the credit has gone to the counter-insurgency strategies of 55-year-old Petraeus.</p> <p>Yesterday, Gates credited Petraeus's \"brilliant strategy\" and its implementation by US troops and field commanders for the success of the surge.</p> <p>\"I think he's played a historic role. There is just no two ways about it,\" he said.</p> <p>Petraeus oversaw the surge, but it was his former deputy Odierno who first proposed it in December 2006 to a resistant Pentagon, setting the stage for what would become a pivotal turn in the unpopular war.</p> <p>Odierno, criticised for riding roughshod over civilians during his first tour to Iraq in 2003-2004, implemented the surge as the corps commander from December 2006 to March 2008, which Gates said made him the right person to replace Petraeus.</p> <p>Odierno carried out the detailed counter-insurgency campaign that poured US troops into Baghdad, cleared al-Qaida insurgents from havens in communities surrounding the capital and targeting Shia extremists.</p> <p>\"Just as important as the surge was the change in our tactics, techniques and procedures that got us back out in the neighbourhoods,\" Odierno told reporters at the end of his previous tour in March.</p> <p>Odierno takes charge at a time when, according to Gates, American forces are on a \"mission in transition\" as troop numbers shrink with more and more provinces being handed back to Iraqi control.</p> <p>\"There is no question we will still be engaged as we are, but the areas in which we are seriously engaged will I think continue to narrow,\" Gates said.</p> <p>\"And the challenge for General Odierno is how do we work with the Iraqis to preserve the gains that have already been achieved, and expand upon them even as the number of US forces are shrinking.\"</p> <p>Iraq handles security in 11 of its 18 provinces with plans to take over a few more by the end of the year.</p> <p>But the country remains fragile. Yesterday, bombings killed at least 34 people and wounded dozens more.</p> <p>In the worst case, a woman suicide bomber killed 22 in a crowd of people breaking the Ramadan fast in the town of Bala Druz, Diyala province.</p> <p>Odierno has argued consistently against sharp cutbacks in American troop levels in Iraq. But the US force of 146,000 will shrink by about 8,000 in January when Bush leaves office. </p> <p>Pressure for further reductions is likely to intensify as attention shifts toward Afghanistan.</p>",

Dominic West (L) and Wendell Pierce in The Wire. Photograph: Kobal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During my best friend's stag do, a splinter group broke off to discuss the television phenomenon <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/media/wire\">The Wire</a>. No one was surprised: get a group of 30-something men with slight artistic pretensions together these days and it seems almost inevitable that they'll be talking about McNulty, Bunk and Stringer Bell. The general consensus was that it's more a social and cultural document than a typical cop show; mixing novelistic flourishes with street smart dialogue and characters whose imperfections make them all the more real. Which is fair enough, but talking about it in such hushed tones - as though this was something that no one had ever thought of before \u2013 suggests that lovers of The Wire don't actually read crime novels.<br><br>This is both a shame, and surprising. The Wire is the most consciously literary of all crime dramas. Its creator, David Simon, wrote the classic true crime account Homicide: Life on the Streets, which Canongate has recently republished; Richard Price and George Pelecanos \u2013 two great postwar American novelists \u2013 wrote some of the scripts. Yet from the admittedly anecdotal amount of evidence I've gleaned, it seems that The Wire's literary pedigree isn't pushing people to read Pelecanos and Price, let alone some of the writers who inspired them. And while Pelecanos and Price and superb writers, two of their crime writing antecedents really do take some beating. </p> <p><a href=\"http://josephwambaugh.net/\">Joseph Wambaugh</a> first staked out the territory since occupied by Price and Pelecanos. Wambaugh was an ex-cop whose novels and non-fiction count among the most realistic, pugnacious and nuanced of all police procedurals. Starting in the early 70s, he shone a new light on the dark humour of the cops who patrolled a decaying Los Angeles. His novel The Choir Boys, which was preceded by the masterful non-fiction work The Onion Field, stand out from his early work, but was followed by a patchy run of novels. Only his return to the police of LA in Hollywood Station (a suggestion, or plea, from James Ellroy being the impetus) restored his reputation as a real master of genre.</p> <p>But If Wambaugh honed and shaped this more messy, character driven-crime writing, then <a href=\"http://www.edmcbain.com/\">Ed McBain</a> invented it. His 87th Precinct novels - all of which begin with the epigram: \"The City in these pages is imaginary. The people, the places, are all fictions. Only the police routine is based on established investigatory techniques\" \u2013 are the books to which so much detective fiction indebted.</p> <p>These tales \u2013 short, violent, meticulously plotted \u2013 show the police as more than just an ace detective surrounded by stooges and sidekicks. Here was a company of men and women trying to make it through each shift, through each case, with their humour and their lives intact. The series' brevity, wit and ear for the vernacular of both the tough and the weak are as cracking in their understatements as Chandler and Hammett were with their wise-acre shtick. </p> <p>Ed McBain wrote more than 50 novels set in the 87th Precinct, and peopled them with truly memorable characters on both sides of the law. If there's a hero among the policemen, he's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a81jrpM4jI\">Steve Carella</a>; but he is ably joined by a cast of 'tecs who you feel are just on the other side of the interrogation room wall, hammering out another depressingly preventable crime. Unlucky-in-love Bert Kling is a favourite, as \"Fat\" Ollie Weeks of the 88th Precinct; even incidental characters, such as desk sergeant Dave Murchinson, soon become welcome friends.</p> <p>For me every American crime novel since - and many more besides - owes McBain a debt. He deserves the same credit and the kudos lavished on The Wire: a pertinent example being his masterpiece, <a href=\"http://www.edmcbain.com/books/precinct_mixed_hope_sum.asp?bookID=3b_05&amp;Category=PRECINCT\">Sadie When She Died</a>, where his inventive use of a wire-tap not only blows open the case, but also catches a man's final fall in an intimate and unswervingly emotional denouement. Just as The Wire has reinvented the cop show, McBain redrew the territory, the feel and the soul of the crime novel. It would be fitting if that show's popularity could in any way lead readers back to the 87th Precinct, where they'd feel right at home.</p>",
  "<p>\"If I thought <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> going would be helpful to our election chances, I would tell him. But it would be irresponsible for him to go now. The financial system is in crisis and we would have a civil war, \" one passionate Brownite tells me over the phone. <br><br>I don't doubt his sincerity on either assertion: he would have the guts to tell the boss to walk (he certainly has the access) if he thought it right. But I talk to equally sincere politicians who have reached just the opposite conclusion; that Gordon must go at almost any cost if the government is to stand a chance of recovery. </p> <p>An ex-Brown ally I spoke to this week was in quiet despair about the boss's inability to take the good advice on offer, amid all the other advice he gets. The government isn't getting its message across, it's undermining loyal allies, it's mostly No 10's fault, he said.</p> <p>But my loyal Brownite's reasoning is worth listening to amid the chorus of complaint by the latest group of Gordon-Must-Go MPs to climb out of the trench and attack: Siobhain McDonagh, Joan Ryan, Jim Dowd, Barry Gardiner and others, up to and including George Howarth, who joined the campaign publicly last night. Mr Loyal offers an overlooked twist.</p> <p>Mr Loyal dismisses the widely-circulated claim that No 10 leaked the McDonagh letter to party general secretary Ray Collins (not to Geoff Hoon, as I suggested here the other day: my mistake) in order to detonate the rebels' mortar prematurely, well ahead of next week's party conference in Manchester.</p> <p>His version has the BBC's Nick Robinson accidentally triggering the drama when he suggested that the threat to Brown was receding. A key rebel then tipped off reporters that several MPs had written to Collins demanding nomination papers be sent out, which was rejected by Labour's NEC today. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/16/labourleadership.labour\">Patrick Wintour</a> reports this morning that the issue may go to court.</p> <p>When one potential rebel who had been privately named \u2013 Ivan Lewis, so I am told - was challenged, he angrily denied doing any such thing. To sustain credibility and momentum McDonagh had to be outed and duly was on Friday. </p> <p>Her old chum Joan Ryan, who holds highly marginal Enfield, wheeled in, so did others in successive days. \"They had to act,\" says Mr Loyal. \"They wanted the mood music to be heavy, but not out of control.\"</p> <p>Why? Because the rebels know Gordon Brown will survive his party conference and soldier on. \"They've fired their bullets and missed.\" So the goalposts have been moved again. Brown must survive the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> in his own backyard, probably on November 6, two days after the McCain-Obama showdown. There must a boost for Labour there, I expect they tell each other: either a Democrat or a Scotsman wins!</p> <p>Mr Loyal says that private briefings organised in the regions for councillors and activists by Derek \"Dolly\" Draper \u2013 ex-Mandelson aide, turned psychotherapist and born-again Labour volunteer \u2013 reveal the party in the country to be united behind the leadership and angry with the rebels. </p> <p>Yeah right, I hear you murmur. And I certainly meet a lot of disaffected Labour voters in my travels, admittedly mostly in London, though not just in medialand. But bear with me. Mr Loyal says there is no unity candidate out there to bind up Labour's wounds, not even a unity stopgap leader. Hence his talk of civil war.</p> <p>The overlooked twist is the fragility of Labour's biggest trade union ally, the recently merged Unite, which combines Amicus and the once-mighty T&amp;G union in uneasy partnership. </p> <p>\"It's in chaos,\" claims Mr Loyal. Why? Because the two joint general secretaries, Tony Woodley and Derek Simpson, don't get on and Simpson faces a legal challenge from the left about his hopes to stay on until retirement \u2013 he is 63 \u2013 without facing re-election.</p> <p>Simpson was the left's candidate in the battle to oust Ken Jackson - \"Tony Blair's favourite union leader\" - as leader of the engineers section of Amicus. </p> <p>Tory legislation requires trade union leaders to face re-election every five years unless they are over 60. Then they can go on until retirement. The same argument the left used against Jackson are now being deployed against Simpson: namely that union mergers mean that the constituency which elected him is not the one he now represents.</p> <p>The issue is now with the certification officer. If he decides that an election is required, Woodley could not allow his rival to seek a mandate from the whole Unite membership. He would have to join the race. There would also be a challenge from the left, perhaps Gerry Hicks, an activist in the south-west. </p> <p>None of this might happen. In fact, other chums assure me that Simpson, who is more supportive of Brown than Woodley, will be allowed to stay on until his 65th birthday \u2013 December 2009 \u2013 or face re-election only within his own Amicus section of Unite. No worry.</p> <p>Either way it might provide a very uncertain backdrop to any future Labour leadership contest; this an event where senior union leaders are normally expected to be on hand to provide a bit of sensible ballast rather than making inflammatory and competitive comments as seemed to be the case at the TUC last week. </p> <p>Unions provide ballast in hard times \u2013 it was the absence of an equivalent ballast added to Tory woes in their lean years. Brown may worry that Woodley will want to cut funding to Labour now that the Yates investigation has killed off other sources. David Cameron would like to squeeze the unions own funds. But that's another story.</p>",
  "<p>The name Walter Monegan, I mean. He's the former Alaska public safety commissioner whom Sarah Palin fired when he wouldn't dismiss Palin's sister's ex-husband (she says she fired him over unspecified performance issues). </p> <p>He's gone on the record now, <a href=\"http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=5804703\">to ABCNews.com</a>, for the first time on the question of whether the governor and her husband pressured him on the bro-in-law. He says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"She's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her<br>husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten. And she's not telling the truth<br>to the media about her reasons for firing me....\"</p> <p>...\"This is not a 'he said she said' situation. Others were contacted by<br>Todd and Sarah as well,\" according to Monegan, who said he was confident<br>the investigation would find adequate documentation to corroborate his<br>testimony.</p> </blockquote> <p>Palin told Charlie Gibson last week \"I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody.\" Looks like we're going to find out.<br></p>",

In a parallel universe, their songs, a series of yelps over DIY shards of rhythm with chanted choruses and slim, size-zero melodies, would all be smash hits. Hearts Revolution, who have been touring as support to the New Band of the Day-sanctioned Midnight Juggernauts, call themselves thrash-metal electronicists and boy/grrrl revolutionaries, with echoes in the latter phrase of the likes of Huggy Bear from the early-90s riot grrrl era. In fact, they're like Huggy Bear plugged into the National Grid. They've even remixed the Bear's best-known song, Her Jazz, with its immortal kiss-off to the straight world, \"This is happening without your permission\". They've got songs that teeter on that fine line between brutal and beautiful, songs about laser beams and wolves and libertines, with titles like Ultraviolence and Switchblade, which sound like they've been lifted from one of Bobby Gillespie's doodle-pads. They've even got a genuinely pretty ballad called Digital Suicide with shades of Suicide's Dream Baby Dream that references something called \"sonic dreams\" and contains a deeply old-fashioned demand to \"stop the world, I want to get off\".<br> And yet they're so fashionable and of-the-moment that Hearts Revolution are currently making people in Hoxton weep tears of joy. They've got all the right global connections (New York, Tokyo, LA, Paris), if they were any better looking it would be illegal, oh, and they \"redrawing the lines between art and commerce\". Just like that. Roughly translated, this means they're handling the packaging and marketing, the visual aspect of what they do, all by themselves, under the rubric, Choose Your Own Adventure. Live, artist and fashion designer Kate Moross adds fluoro images and projections, but they don't play regular gigs, no sir, that would be so 20th century. No, instead they've got their own branded ice-cream truck, a pink machine called Hearts Challenger that is known to pull up at parties, art openings and music events, and from the back of which they spontaneously jam (a rockist term meaning \"plug in and play\"). They also sell sweets and Japanese toys from the van as a way of enhancing the idea of Hearts Revolution as a self-contained dream world. But they're not nihilists or angry angst-merchants. \"We do what we want, support who we love,\" they declare, quaintly. \"How? We are powered by love.\" Cute. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They are dedicated to progressing the state of music and pushing change in all the right places.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They're a Crystal Castles you don't have to pretend to like.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Sell you some sherbet fountains.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sell you the idea of rock'n'roll as a capitalist scheme to control the masses.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Their debut single Ultraviolence is released on December 1 by Kitsune. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Crystal Castles, Atari Teenage Riot, the Boredoms, Shampoo. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution\">www.myspace.com/heartsrevolution</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Peter Conway. </p>",
  "<p>Universities have been recruiting record numbers of part-time students to meet the government's target of getting 50% of young adults into higher education by 2010.</p> <p>Part-time enrolments at undergraduate level have grown more rapidly than full-time students in the past 10 years and now make up nearly half of the student population, according to the latest <a href=\"http://bookshop.universitiesuk.ac.uk/latest/\">trends report </a> from Universities UK.</p> <p>The number of part-time students taking first degrees has more than doubled over a decade. In 2006-07, they accounted for 201,145 of those taking a first degree, compared with 89,670 in 1997-8.</p> <p>Full-time undergraduate student numbers grew by just over 20% to 1.2m in the same period, according to the report.</p> <p>And the trend will need to continue if the sector is to expand to the extent proposed by the Leitch review, particularly given the predicted decrease in the number of 18-year-olds after 2009, the report warns.</p> <p>In universities in England, there were a total of 762,870 part-time students in 2006-07, compared with 1,027,370 in the UK overall. </p> <p>Part-time students now account for 45.6% of university enrolments, including postgraduates, which will put greater pressure on the government to increase the financial support available to them.</p> <p>While they have to pay, proportionally, the same fees as full-time students, part-time students do not at present receive student loans or grants from the government.</p> <p>Last year, the education select committee called for an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/aug/05/highereducation.uk\">urgent review</a> of the financial support for part-time students.</p> <p>Vice-chancellors raised the issue again with the universities secretary, John Denham, at the UUK annual conference last week.</p> <p>The overall focus of the UUK report is on university finances. Universities' income grew by more than 50% between 2000-01 and 2006-07, it finds.</p> <p>In 2006-07, half the sector's income came from funding council teaching and research grants, and from tuition fees.</p> <p>The fees paid by international students are propping up the sector to the tune of \u00a31.7bn. Their numbers have more than doubled over the past decade.</p> <p>In 2006-07, there were 239,210 international students in UK universities, 10.1% of the total population. Ten years ago, they made up just 6.5% of the student body.</p> <p>Across the UK, enrolments in universities have increased by 31% from 1997-98 to 2006-07.</p> <p>Undergraduate numbers have increased by 28%, while there has been even stronger growth of 45% at postgraduate level.</p> <p>Students are increasingly choosing to study subjects allied to medicine, biological sciences, mathematical sciences, law, communication, historical and philosophical studies, and creative arts and design.</p> <p>The figures for 2006-07 also show a growth in education and social studies over the preceding decade.</p> <p>Prof Geoffrey Crossick, the chair of Universities UK's Longer Term Strategy Group, which produced the report with GuildHE, said: \"As well as the usual rich source of data on higher education, this year's report also includes extensive financial analysis, which is made available at an important period for higher education funding.</p> <p>\"The analysis provides evidence of the increasingly diverse income portfolio that universities are developing as part of a wider strategy to reduce dependence on public funding. This necessitates the improvements in risk management that the sector has been putting in place.</p> <p>\"Across the sector as a whole, a median surplus of 2.3% was generated. This is well below the 3% to 5% level which is judged the minimum necessary to allow investment for sustainability.\"</p>",
  "<p>The saddest revelation in last night's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00djm75/\">The Dark Side of Fame</a>, in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/may/07/pressandpublishing.iraq\">Piers Morgan</a> interviewed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/sep/12/jimdavidsonshellskitchenex\">Jim Davidson</a>, was not the comedian's inability to comprehend why he wasn't funny anymore.</p> <p>It was when he admitted he still watches old episodes of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/generationgame/\">The Generation Game</a>.</p> <p>\"I miss The Generation Game a lot,\" he said while emotive piano music played in the background. Fame, it seems, can be very dark indeed.</p> <p>But then most people watching already knew that. The dark side of being famous is hardly unchartered territory. </p> <p>As a consequence it was only a mildly murky time spent in Morgan and Davidson's company. There was nothing new here, Davidson had a typical \"I am what I am\" line of defence and said the following when asked about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/sep/12/imjustboredbytvcontrovers\">Brian Dowling</a> whom he'd worked with on Hell's Kitchen in 2007:</p> <p>\"He might be gay, poof, shirtlifter, sausage jockey \u2013 whatever I called them but he's still the person who I want to spend \u00a317.50 to come and see me and more importantly like me.\"</p> <p>Groan. What's more shocking than Jim Davidson saying \"shirt lifter\" is that someone is prepared to pay nearly \u00a320 to see his tired routine.</p> <p>It was a mystery as to why he was on a show that prior to transmission was dubbed \"Piers Morgan's incisive new series\".</p> <p>His views on black men and women who might find his jokes offensive was simply: \"They should come and see me and then they wouldn't feel like that\". His views on women? \"I don't like 'em\". He is a man who has refused to move with the times and was given the luxury of 50 minutes worth of TV in which to demonstrate it.</p> <p>Morgan had been a good interviewer throughout but rather spoilt it all by admitting at the end:</p> <p>\"The worst thing of all Jim is, I can't believe I'm going to have to admit this, you still make me laugh.\"</p> <p>Please don't say that! Someone might now be tempted to resurrect <a href=\"http://www.ukgameshows.com/page/index.php?title=Big_Break\">Big Break</a> and that would be nearly as unacceptable as some of the things Davidson said last night.</p> <p>So from now on, can we please leave Jim Davidson with his tapes of vintage episodes of The Generation Game on the dark side \u2013 you know, the parts of fame where the cameras and lights no longer venture?</p>",
  "<p>The Venice Biennale of Architecture may not be as prestigious as the older and larger <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/history/\">Biennale of Contemporary Art</a>, but it still represents a unique opportunity to explore not only the national pavillions of the <a href=\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_giardini\">Giardini</a>, the Biennale Gardens, but also a host of spaces - the Arsenale, palaces, churches, private mansions - that are normally closed off to the public. The title of the 11th Biennale is Out There: Architecture Beyond Building, which gives a clear indication that these days the exhibits are just as interesting for the general public as for professional architects and designers. There is an incredible choice of exhibits from 56 countries, plus 25 collateral events. Seeing everything is pretty much impossible, so here are 10 not to miss.</p> <h2>1. Biennale Gardens, British Pavillion </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657182\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/britain2.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: British Pavillion\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any visit to the Biennale begins at the Giardini, the sprawling gardens where over 30 countries have their national pavilions. It is not chauvinistic for once to say that the British pavillion is one of the grandest, strategically looking down over the adjoining French and German pavillions. And this year's exhibition, Home/Away, has been acclaimed as one of the best in the Biennale. Five architects - Sergison Bates, Tony Fretton, de Rijke Marsh Morgan, Witherford Watson Mann and Maccreanor Lavington - have been selected to illustrate the particularly British obsession of owning your own house, and examine whether this can function in the rest of Europe. And the questions asked could not be more relevant given the current credit crunch and collapse of the housing market.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/biennale/intro.html\">britishcouncil.org/biennale/intro</a></p> <h2>2. Ca' Del Duca, Luxembourg</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657730\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/luxembourg.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Ca' Del Duca, Luxembourg\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As you follow signs for Luxembourg's pavillion, you come to what looks like a dead end - a small courtyard with a single tall tree coming out on to the Grand Canal. But a small door at the end leads to the discrete <a href=\"http://www.boglewood.com/cornaro/xcadelduca.html\">Ca' Del Duca</a> palace, which was built in the 15th century. Luxembourg's exhibition could not be more minimalist - a series of white boards that snake from one room into another. But the idea is intriguing for those who take the time to read about it - four crucial architectural questions answered by 12 different Europeans.</p> <h2>3. Museo Diocenesa Urbis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337657731\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/cloister.jpg\" alt=\"Venice Biennale: Museo Diocenesa Urbis\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This collateral exhibition showcases the architectually influenced artworks of the Venetian artist, <a href=\"http://www.gaspare-foundation.com/exhibitions.html\">Gaspare Manos</a>. There are 150 works on show, and his paintings are bright, vivid impressions of cities around the world. But this is also a brilliant opportunity to discover one of Venice's most wonderful cloisters, the <a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/italy/venice/review-186474.html\">Chiostro di Sant Apollonia</a>. Built in the 12th century, this is Venice's only surviving Romanesque cloister, and the rest of the building where the exhibition is on view is a former Benedictine Monastery.</p> <h2>4. Corderie &amp; Artigliere</h2> <p>The ancient buildings of Venice's once mighty <a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/italy/venice/review-146821.html\">Arsenale</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/art/venues/corderie/\">Corderie and Artigliere</a>, form a vast alternative exhibition hall for the countries that don't have their own national pavillion in the Biennale Gardens. The space itself is easily as impressive as many of the installations, and it sometimes seems that each exhibit just tries to shock the visitor more than its neighbour.

Push through the door and you enter a closed courtyard with a grand well, and The Lives of Spaces is housed in a series of rooms decorated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murano\">Murano</a> chandeliers and period paintings on the first floor.

  "<p>Rapid action is need to protect thousands of families whose homes are at risk of repossession, the Liberal Democrats said today.</p> <p>Delegates at the party's Bournemouth conference called for a new code of practice for mortgage lenders to ensure a property is only repossessed as a last resort.</p> <p>The measure would ensure all borrowers struggling to make payments would be offered free financial advice and a chance to renegotiate the terms of their loan.</p> <p>People in arrears would also be given the opportunity to sell the equity in their home to a registered social landlord and become part-tenants of the property.</p> <p>Julia Goldsworthy, the Lib Dems' communities and local government spokeswoman, told delegates that courts ought to ensure repossessions were only granted if lenders followed the stipulations of a new code.</p> <p>Moving a motion outlining measures to help homeowners keep a \"roof over their heads\", she told delegates action needed to be taken to curb the rate of repossessions, which were predicted to hit 45,000 this year: \"Repossession must not become the easy option for banks desperate to reduce their mortgage book,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This wouldn't involve major legislation and could be brought in almost immediately. All that is needed is for the government to recognise the problem.\"</p> <p>Delegates backed in full the package of measures, which also included allowing people to sell some of the equity in their home to a social landlord to avoid being pushed out into the hands of \"unregulated private companies\", or on to the streets.</p> <p>The motion also called for councils and registered social landlords to borrow against their assets to buy unsold properties and cut housing waiting lists.</p> <p>Vincent Cable, the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman, said: \"Ministers should not try to turn back the tide of a housing market, which needs to fall to a more affordable level. Instead they should concern themselves with the many thousands in danger of being cast out on the street.</p> <p>\"Rapid action must be taken to ensure that banks only ever repossess as a last resort. Now is also the time to allow councils and housing associations to borrow against their assets and build up the social housing stock for the many millions on waiting lists.\"</p>",
  "<p>Let's talk about lollipops, baby. In response to a series of high-profile sexual harassment <a href=\"http://us.oneworld.net/article/sexual-harassment-part-daily-life-egypt\">incidents</a> that have gripped Egyptian society, a viral email campaign has appeared promoting religious dress as an antidote to harassment. In it, <a href=\"http://commercial-archive.com/node/144493\">two pink lollipops</a> are shown, one swarming with flies, the other, covered with a wrapper, unmolested. In Arabic, the poster reads, \"You can't stop them, but you can protect yourself\". The religious message is clear: dress modestly.</p> <p>The campaign is anonymous, so the motivation for the photograph is uncertain (though <a href=\"http://arabist.net/hatshepsut/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/24072008.jpg\">similar</a> images have been displayed elsewhere in Cairo), yet the image relies on a mistaken premise. For those who have attached religion to sexual harassment have unwittingly helped the perpetrators, by suggesting insufficiently modest women are to blame for being harassed. But sexual harassment is not a form of proselytising. It is an act of violence.</p> <p>I've written before about the trends in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/islam.gender\">feminism</a> in the Middle East and what those of us in the west can do to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/religion.gender\">support</a> it. But any discussion of feminism in the region must also take into account particular social attitudes, the way men interact with women, and that, as recent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7514567.stm\">studies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/egypt.gender\">articles</a> have made clear, brings us squarely (though not exclusively) against sexual harassment, the wolf whistles and more that seem to form part of the background noise for women south of the Alps.</p> <p>(To be clear, harassment occurs <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4192672.stm\">everywhere</a>, and is often given a religious justification it does not deserve. In the modern Middle East, that justification has been framed most often in terms of Islam, since that is the dominant faith of the region, though similar justifications also occur in most other faiths.)</p> <p>Perhaps the easiest way to understand what underlies harassment is to start in the west, without any cultural baggage. One could think of harassment as being on a spectrum of sexual violence, which ends with abuse and even rape. At the beginning of this spectrum is a substantial grey area: it is here where, between individuals, some gestures of domination are acceptable or even welcomed.</p> <p>An Italian friend once told me how, living in London, she missed the daily catcalls of Rome that were, to her, affirmations of her sexual power. Other women feel precisely the opposite. That's why it's a grey area: the same gestures can mean different things and be received differently, and it is in the ambiguity of those gestures that some of the mating dance is practised.</p> <p>Further along the spectrum, it becomes easier to say what is unacceptable, but harder to know how to react. Grabbing a woman's breasts or slipping a hand between her legs in public, uninvited, is clearly unacceptable \u2013 but what is less understood is that women who have experienced such harassment <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7593765.stm\">report</a> similar feelings to victims of sexual violence (like rape): the same guilt that it may be their fault, the edgy feeling it might happen again, the concern that, through their actions, they might provoke it. That's why sexual harassment is a violent act, because it is experienced as a real violation, an emotional violation.</p> <p>With regard to clothes, some men see a woman dressed in a way that makes her stand out as a form of assault. They see, in the woman strutting her stuff, a simultaneous impingement on their consciousness and \u2013 importantly \u2013 a rejection of them.</p> <p>That would explain why female friends of mine have had the epithet \"bitch\" or \"whore\" spat at them on the streets of London while they were simply going about their daily lives. Far from the provocation being how tight their jeans were, or how expensive their suits were, it was rather the harasser feeling that those women had demonstrated their attractiveness and, at the same time, somehow already rejected him \u2013 and him wanting to impose himself on them in the way that men can, through our physical strength, our power to cause fear.</p> <p>An important part of this is to note that the actual style of clothing makes no difference. Research from the Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights showed that women in hijab are harassed as much as unveiled women. Women in fewer clothes who are called whore in the west and women in more clothes who are called bitch in the Middle East are two sides of the same coin. It is the way the men react to their clothes that matters, not the clothes themselves.</p> <p>This is where we get to the differences in cultures. Because what form that reaction takes \u2013 whether it is a word spat in frustration or a hand across the derriere in public \u2013 is very much dictated by social norms, what constraints the society and culture places on such behaviour. </p> <p>This is where an Egyptian <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/08/egypt.html\">campaign</a> called \"Respect Yourself\" has been focused \u2013 on changing male perceptions of what is acceptable. There is, naturally, a cocktail of emotions at play, not just the will to dominate, also lust, desire, even boredom, but at root wanting to impose yourself on a woman's private space, to touch her in a way that lets her know you exist, is a desire to dominate.</p> <p>And so we come to religion. The positing of a religious element to sexual harassment strikes me as mistaken. Most men don't need religion to know how to act. For those who do harass, religion is no more than a post-act justification.</p> <p>Understanding that, I think, explains two things. It explains, firstly, why the minority of men who do harass are normally very discriminating about their targets \u2013 excluding, for example, their sisters and cousins from the equation, regardless of the level of those women's religious devotion.</p> <p>It also explains why women who wear the headscarf, even westerners acquiring it temporarily in Muslim countries, are treated with more respect by some, but are subject to the same level of harassment by others. Because the headscarf, in this context, is a symbol, an external manifestation of inward devotion, and so those men who are attuned to what the symbol means will treat the wearers with more respect, in the way monks in Buddhist countries or soldiers in uniform in some parts of America are respected. At the same time, those who want to harass women will do so regardless, because they are doing it out of a want to dominate, rather than a religious reason.</p> <p>It might be \u2013 with regard to the Egyptian lollipop poster \u2013 that those who are religiously inclined genuinely feel modest clothing would protect women from lechers. But giving harassment this religious dimension \u2013 by suggesting modesty is a factor in being attacked \u2013 is dangerous. It absolves the harassers from blame, while coercing women into dressing a certain way.</p> <p>What would be better \u2013 and not only in the Middle East \u2013 is a society that stands up against such crimes, allows a woman to report them safely and a legal system that swiftly punishes them. Talk of religion only gives offenders something to hide behind.</p>",
  "<p>According to the RAC the cost of motoring is actually going down. \"In real terms it is 18% cheaper to buy and run a car, including fuel costs, in 2008 than 1988,\" claimed a recent report from the motoring organisation.</p> <p>That may be so, but <a href=\"http://www.racnews.co.uk/index.asp?PageID=23&amp;subsection=reports&amp;submitted=1\">said same report</a> also admits some aspects of running a car are now much more expensive. Fuel, for example, has gone up by 200% in real terms over the past two decades.</p> <p>The cost of owning and running a car is on average \u00a35,627 a year, says the RAC. Half of that is depreciation, nearly \u00a31,200 is fuel, and the rest is tax, interest payments, insurance, maintenance, and breakdown membership. So what can you do to reduce these costs?</p> <h2>1. Drive like a saint</h2> <p>Smoother driving leads to a big saving in fuel, and a big cash saving too. Over 10,000 miles you might <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/10/travelandtransport.carbonemissions\">save \u00a3500 by driving efficiently</a>, according to a recent test done by the Driving Standards Agency.</p> <p>If you pull away from traffic lights without revving, don't rev while idle, don't use fuel-hungry air-conditioning and don't sit there with the engine running you can <a href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/fuels-and-environment/drive-smart.html\">cut fuel use by between 10% and a third</a>, the AA claims.</p> <p>And slow down - according to the Department for Transport, driving at 70mph uses <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/ActOnCO2/?q=tips_and_advice\">up to 9% more fuel than driving at 60mph</a>, and up to 15% more fuel than driving at 50mph.</p> <h2>2. Plan your journeys</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337653798\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/SatnavSony.jpg\" alt=\"Satnav system\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A satnav system. Photograph: Sony</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sony</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It sounds obvious but don't get lost - it wastes fuel. Use a map, know where you are going, use a satnav system, ask for directions, or use an online route planner like the <a href=\"http://www.theaa.com/travelwatch/planner_main.jsp\">AA's</a> or the <a href=\"http://route.rac.co.uk/\">RAC's</a> to help. Plan where to buy fuel so you don't end up buying it at a motorway service station, which are up to 10p a litre more expensive, according to the RAC. The <a href=\"http://www.petrolprices.com/\">Petrolprices.com website</a> shows you where to find the cheapest filling stations - and you can register to receive an alert when prices in your area change.</p> <p>Plan what you need to do before you go so, where possible, you only make one journey instead of lots of little ones. In the same vein, don't drive around looking for a parking space - park where you can and walk the extra block. </p> <h2>3. Maintain your car</h2> <p>Keep your tyres properly inflated and the car will run more efficiently, saving you money on fuel. Take the roof rack off to streamline it - this can increase fuel efficiency by up to 5%. Empty the boot of unnecessary clutter - each 50kg of weight means you burn an extra 1%-2% fuel. Keep your car regularly serviced and change the oil regularly - this stops minor problems becoming big, expensive ones. </p> <h2>4. Cut the cost of your MOT</h2> <p>The government sets a <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/OwningAVehicle/Mot/DG_4022514\">maximum price for an MOT</a> test and garages don't tend to compete much - although members of some motoring groups do get discounts at some test centres. But you can keep a lid on extra expenses. If you are concerned about a garage persuading you to have work done that doesn't really need doing you could use an MOT centre run by your local authority. These places deal mainly with council vehicles, but also offer MOTs to regular drivers. They have no incentive to artificially inflate minor problems into expensive repair work. Find a list <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/travel/cheap-mot#find\">here</a> or ask your council.</p> <h2>5. Don't pay over the odds for car finance</h2> <p>The initial outlay is the most expensive part of owning a car - and if you don't buy it outright with cash then you will also have a loan to repay. So don't simply sign up for the first one offered to you in the car showroom; these are invariably expensive, with high rates of annual interest. Shop around, using a price comparison site such as <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/refusedcredit/CarFinanceFinder.asp?IsCar=1&amp;alternativeSource=MSCARFINANCE\">moneysupermarket.com</a>.</p> <p>Savings can be considerable. The current best buy on the site is a Barclaycard personal loan of \u00a34,000 repaid over 36 months. This would have repayments of \u00a3124 a month and cost \u00a3482 in interest (APR 7.8%). The worst buy is a Real Personal Finance loan with monthly repayments of \u00a3217, and APR at 64%, which would cost \u00a33,843 in interest payments alone over the life of the loan.</p> <p>If you have an expensive car loan or finance deal then switch to a cheaper one - it's often as simple as switching credit cards.</p> <h2>6. Save on insurance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337653799\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/09/16/CarsDavidLevene.jpg\" alt=\"Cars in storage\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cheapest way to slash car insurance costs is to lie - pretend your car is kept in a garage down a quiet country lane at your mum's house when you fill in the form. Unfortunately, as well as being illegal, you'll also get caught out if you need to make a claim. The safest way to cut your costs is to drive carefully and build up your no claims bonus. And of course shop around for the best deal on the price comparison websites. Be thorough - you need to search several to cover most of the insurance market. </p> <p>If you search moneysupermarket.com, gocompare.com, Confused.com and OnlyInsurance.com you will cover almost 90% of the market. Direct Line doesn't deal with price comparison websites, so it is worth visiting its website for a quote. Once you have this, ask if your own insurer will match or better the deal - it's surprising what a bit of haggling can do. Many insurers impose a charge for monthly direct debit payments so if you can, avoid this by paying a full year's premiums upfront. </p> <h2>7. Consider pay-and-claim breakdown cover</h2> <p>There are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/jun/16/motorinsurance.insurance\">two main types of breakdown cover</a>: pay-and-claim or full service. Pay-and-claim tends to be cheaper, and uses local garages to rescue you and do the work. You pay for it and send your receipts in to claim the money back. Full service outfits, meanwhile, get you back on the road or to a garage without asking you to foot the bill. Check the policy and decide what is most suitable for you - many cover the person not the car, others offer cards for partners.</p> <h2>8. Shop around for your car</h2> <p>Work out what type of car you want, then use websites such as <a href=\"http://www.glass.co.uk/\">Glass</a>, <a href=\"http://www.whatcar.com/\">What Car?</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.parkers.co.uk/\">Parker's</a> to establish how much you should be paying. Once you've found a car that fits, haggle - it's expected. </p> <p>Don't buy a brand new car - you save literally thousands of pounds by buying the same model with a few thousand miles on the clock. January is often a good time to buy - dealers are strapped and there are fewer buyers about.</p> <h2>9. Convert your car to liquefied petroleum gas </h2> <p>This sounds like a lot of work, but high mileage drivers can recover their set-up costs quite quickly. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is half the price of petrol or diesel, and will take you just as far. A conversion costs around \u00a32,000, which means if you spend \u00a370 a week on petrol an LPG system will pay for itself in under a year. Converting doesn't mean getting rid of the petrol tank - you can keep that and flick from LPG to petrol using a dashboard switch. The only downside is the tank, which takes up a big chunk of the boot. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/\">Drivelpg</a> is a good place to start and has a handy <a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/savings_calculator.php\">savings calculator</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drivelpg.co.uk/map/index.php\">map of LPG stations</a> in the UK. If you live in London, LPG conversions are also often exempt from the congestion charge - find out more at the <a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/fleet/cityschemes/congestioncharge/\">energy saving trust</a>.</p> <h2>10.

  "<p>Ukraine's pro-western governing coalition has collapsed following a row over last month's war between Georgia and Russia. The Ukrainian parliament has 30 days to form a new coalition or call fresh elections.</p> <p>The alliance fell apart after infighting between the president, Viktor Yushchenko, and the prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko. The two leaders were partners during the 2004 Orange Revolution but have become fierce rivals in the run-up to the 2010 presidential election.</p> <p>Yushchenko and Tymoshenko have engaged in a tug-of-war since Tymoshenko regained the premiership in December. They have traded accusations of corruption, incompetence and blocking each other's policies.</p> <p>The final straw came when Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of acting in the Kremlin's favour by failing to condemn Russia's war with Georgia. She fired back, saying that Yushchenko's overwhelming support of Georgia had dragged Ukraine into the conflict.</p> <p>Tymoshenko then teamed up with the Russia-leaning opposition to adopt a law restricting presidential powers and boosting her own. Yushchenko declared the move \"a coup attempt\" and this month his party pulled out of the coalition.</p> <p>The coalition has teetered on the brink ever since and the speaker, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, today announced the government's collapse. \"I officially declare the coalition of democratic forces ... in Ukraine's parliament dissolved,\" he said. \"It is yet another democratic challenge, but I hope that together we will overcome this challenge.\"</p> <p>Some analysts predict a new governing coalition may involve the Russia-leaning Party of Regions.</p> <p>Since Yushchenko became president, Ukraine has made clear its aspiration towards membership of the European Union.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Anything Jeff Stelling can do, I can do less impressively</strong></p> <p>Liverpool failed to score in only one Champions League match last season - the encounter they lost against Marseille at Anfield last season. </p> <p>They exacted a brutal revenge, administering a 4-0 hiding in France which which went some way towards helping Liverpool become the top scorers in last year's Champions League with 29 goals. It's a statistic one Liverpool fan of my acquaintance is prone to parrot while drunk in a desperate bid to prove they were the \"moral victors\" of the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>How they qualified for the Champions League group stages</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>Liverpool finished fourth in the Premier League and were fairly lucky to struggle past Standard Liege 1-0 on aggregate in the third qualifying round, with several excellent Pepe Reina saves and a Dirk Kuyt strike two minutes from the end of extra-time helping them limp over the line. After finishing third in Ligue 1, Marseille booked their place in the group stages by beating Norwegian side SK Brann 3-1 on aggregate, with Benoit \"Brother of Liverpool flop and World Cup winner, Bruno\" Cheyrou and Mamadou Niang (2) doing the necessary.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>This just in:</strong> Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is asking for \u00a3481m to sell the club to a group of investors from Dubai, according to Arabian business experts. If these reports are correct, that's almost twice the \u00a3237m he claims to have paid for the club and \"poured into it\". That's an astonishing price tag, not least when you consider it was only a couple of days ago that Ashley insisted \"I did not buy Newcastle to make money\". He must think Newcastle's fans are idiots. What's that you say? Oh.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Marseille:</strong> Mandanda, Bonnart, Zubar, Hilton, Taiwo, Cana, Cheyrou, Kone, M'Bami, Ben Arfa, Niang.<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Riou, Ziani, Zenden, Kabore, Samassa, Erbate, Valbuena.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Skrtel, Carragher, Dossena, Gerrard, Mascherano, Leiva Lucas, Kuyt, Torres, Babel.<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cavalieri, Agger, Keane, Riera, Alonso, Benayoun, Degen.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Konrad Plautz (Austria)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong> Yes, it's that time of year again and I hope you're all as excited about this latest Euro Tin Pot jamboree as I am. Can Manchester United defend their title? Will Chelsea buy it from them? Will Arsenal succeed in walking the ball into the net often enough to make another final? What levels of tedium can Liverpool plumb this season? Will Celtic achieve the unthinkable and win a match away from home? Watch in fascination as Uefa schedule far more matches than are necessary to provide the answers to all these questions and more.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>First email of the tournament. Needless to say it's pointing out an error on my part</strong>. \"I can assure you Liverpool flop Bruno Cheyrou has never won the World Cup,\" writes Sam Davies. \"Bernard Diomede is probably the Liverpool flop you're thinking of - he was in the French WC-winning squad of 1998.\" You're dead right, Sam, sorry about that. Apologies to you too, Bernard, if you happen to be reading this.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Marseille kick off, with Liverpool setting out a 4-2-3-1 shaped stall, with Mascherano and Lucas playing in the holding roles. What with this match being played in the Stade Velodrome, I can't help but think they'd be better off with Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton in the side. I'm here all week folks ... try the chicken.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Bringing the ball out of defence and under no pressure whatsoever, Javier Mascherano miscues and gifts possession to M'Bami, who plays a ball through the centre for the lightning fast Mamadou Niang to chase. He's offside.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Marseille centre-half Ronald Zubar is beaten for pace by Fernando Torres, but recovers to concede a corner as the Spaniard attempted to wriggle between him and the goal-line. From the dead ball, a Marseille defender flicks it on from the near post, unwittingly teeing up a looping Torres header which goalkeeper Mandonda is forced to tip over the crossbar. That's another corner for Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard sends the ball into the penalty area, Marseille clear and Niang and Bakary Kone attack on the break. Although Liverpool have been left short on numbers in defence, their sortie comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> \"No sponsor on the Liverpool shirts tonight - is that because of French law, or has there been more financial knack today?\" asks Marie Meyer. \"I don't really care about banks and travel companies, but if beer companies start going under, we are all doomed.\" Good spot, Marie. I presume the conspicuous absence of the Carlsberg logo on the shirts of the Liverpool players is something to do with French or Uefa law, as we'd <em>probably</em> have heard about it if they'd gone bust today. Did I mention I'm here all week?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> This is a very open game and Marseille, who aren't looking too shabby, go close when - I think - Taye Taiwo fires over when he should have squared the ball. Apologies, I was too busy congratulating myself on the quality of my <em>probably</em> joke to pay proper attention.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Liverpool scythe through the Marseille defence before Babel shoots over from the edge of the box. Moments later, Dirk Kuyt tees up Steven Gerrard on the edge of the D outside the Marseille penalty area and the Liverpool skipper brings a smart save out of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A corner from Liverpool, from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> \"Alcohol companies are not allowed to advertise on shirts in France,\" writes Paul Reverdy. That's proper order, it would be a terrible shame if French children were encouraged to drink booze from an early age by the sight of some drinks company's logo on Steven Gerrard's chest. After all, it's not as if their parents aren't pouring wine down their throats by the gallon as soon as they come off the breast.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Marseille 1-0 Liverpool (Cana 20)</strong> Marseille's Albanian midfielder Lorik Cana puts his side ahead with a goal that's been a long time coming. Timing his run beautifully, he beat the offside trap set by Liverpool's flat-footed back four and latched on to a marvellous Benoit Cheyrou pass over the heads of the defence. He had all the time in the world to pick his spot and poke the ball low past Reina.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Marseille 1-1 Liverpool (Gerrard 24)</strong> A marvellous equaliser from Steven Gerrard. Liverpool broke down the middle of the field, with Torres on the ball. He picked out Kuyt with a short pass along the edge of the penalty area, then the Dutchman rolled the ball a little behind Gerrard on the edge of the D. The finish was sublime, with the Liverpool captain sending a diagonal, 25 yard chip up and over Mandanda, who was off his line, and into the top left-hand corner.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Liverpool are awarded a penalty when Ronald Zubar sticks his leg out and trips Ryan Babel.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>30min:</strong> Gerrard scores off the foot of the right stick, but his effort disallowed after Dirk Kuyt is penalised for encroachment. He'll have to retake it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Marseille 1-2 Liverpool (Gerrard 32)</strong> Steven Gerrard sends it low and right again. Steve Mandanda guesses the right way, but it's too well placed for him to be able to save it.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> In all the excitement, I forgot to tell you that Martin Skrtel has been booked for a clumsy, unnecessary lunge .</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> \"Fantasy football always brings out the worst in me,\" writes Erik Kennedy, apropos nothing. \"I've been pondering the following phenomenon: <strong>Fantacide, n.</strong> The act of wishing ill on a player you'd normally support because he's not in your fantasy squad.

He gets to his feet and sends the ball into the mixer, where Jamie Carragher heads cleer.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> \"To stop that Gerrard goal, Marseille would have needed one <em>Mananda nother</em> in goal,\" writes Matthew Moore, who is not here all week and thought the chicken was ... fowl.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time analysis:</strong> Dave Hannah writes: \"Barry, I've re-watched Gerrard's penalty a couple of times.

Fancy dans such as yourself should be covering Arsenal.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> Liverpool kick-off, playing into what would be the Kop if this game was at Anfield. Their superiority isn't being reflected in the scoreline would suggest thus far, but continue to look vulnerable to their opponent's deadliest/only weapon: the counter-attack.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> In the Liverpool right-back position, Lucas gets booked for a clumsy challenge on Mathieu Valbuena, who drops like a sack of spuds. The substitute takes the free-kick himself, but his delivery is poor and Steven Gerrard heads clear.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Corner for Marseille, which Valbueno sends into the penalty area. Mamadou Niang gets on the end of it, but heads wide under pressure from Carragher.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> An unlucky bounce off Fernando Torres precludes Steven Gerrard from notching up his 100th goal for Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> \"Here's something you didn't know about today's game,\" writes Richard H, whose reluctance to reveal his full identity can probably be explained by the rest of his email. \"Mauricio Pelligrino's (the Liverpool first team coach) father-in-law's name is Olivera L. Perisomell, which is an anagram of 'Liverpool' and 'Marseille'.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick wide on the left wing, which Steven Gerrard whips into the Marseille penalty area. Vitorino Hilton flicks it wide for a corner, which Gerrard also takes. Skrtel heads the ball down, it drops at Kuyt's feet, but his shot is blocked by Zubar. Marseille counter, but Kono is penalised for offside while chasing another defence-splitting through ball.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Not for the first time this evening, Lucas gifts possession to Marseille. Like myself, he's not having a great day at office. Perhaps he's preoccupied by the worry that it might be his turn to get burgled while Liverpool are playing away from home in Europe. </p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Having been sold short by a chested back-pass from one of his defenders, Marseille keeper Mananda rushes off his line to win a 50-50 ball against Ryan Babel. The Dutchman made it easy for his opponent by shirking a challenge he clearly didn't fancy. Chicken. </p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Marseille substitution from a few minutes ago: The unimpressive Ben Arfa off, Ziani on.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Marseille left-back Taye Taiwo skins Dirk Kuyt for pace down the wing (not the most difficult feat in the world, it must be said) and drills a low cross into the Liverpool penalty area. It's cleared.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Heaven help us all. A Monsieur Franck Galerne has written in to say that he's going to be using this minute-by-minute report to help teach the <em>3e anglais approfondi</em> class to speak English proper.

I suppose this means I'll have to go through it afterwards and correct all the spilling mostakes.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Free-kick for Marseille, about 25 yards out and left of centre. Mathieu Valbuena drives the ball into the wall. A couple of minutes previously, the Marseille substitute Ziani missed a glorious opportunity to draw his side level by sending a close range effort screaming over the cross-bar after being teed up by a wonderful Bakary Kone backheel.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> As the camera pans on to Jamie Carragher in his default setting of stooped, looking knackered with arms at quarter-to-three, sweat pouring down his red face and a hunted look in his eyes, what better time to bring you news of two Liverpool substitutions: Torres and Gerrard off, Riera and Benayoun on.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> On the left flank, Mamadou Niang does well to get a low cross into the Liverpool penalty area. Ziani swings his left peg at it and sends the ball sailing over the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Lorik Cana tries the kind of long-range effort that prompts ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley to say \"you need to do something very, very special to beat Jose Reina from <em>there</em>.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda pulls off one of the best saves I've ever seen. Liverpool attacked, the ball fell kindly for Ryan Babel on the edge of the six-yard box and the Dutchman tried to smash it home with only the goalkeeper to beat. Rushing off his line, Mandanda did his best starfish impression and the ball hit his left arm, which somehow kept the ball out. </p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> \"Can Dave Hannah (half-time analysis) read minds?\" asks Robin Hazlehurst. \"Maybe Mandanda did guess right but dived the other way anyway. Or maybe Stevie G was actually aiming where he dived but miss-hit it. Unlikely, but you never know.\" The second scenario isn't that unlikely. I still think he might have miss-hit the first goal. </p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Some proper match analysis from Liverpool-supporting reader Chris Wells. \"This is a great game,\" he says. \"Going forward we're incisive, Babel and Kuyt are swapping sides and finding space. Marseille are even more exciting going forward, although Ben Arfa has disappointed me today. He reminds me of early Ronaldo (the young, thin one): precocious but petulant and in need of a bollocking from his coach. I'm not entirely sure why, but everytime we've faced Valbuena he's really pushed my buttons. He's like the French Robbie Savage, except good at football.\" Not in this report he isn't.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> The contributions of Benayoun and Riera have been negligible since they came on and the momentum is with Marseille at the moment. They've played well tonight and deserve a point. Liverpool substitution: Kuyt off, Keane on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Liverpool attack courtesy of Yossi Benayoun down the right channel. Keane sprints in the direction of the far post, while Benayoun makes for the corner, where he wins a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Niang wastes a good chance to equalise when he heads the ball wide of the upright from the edge of the penalty area. He appeals for a penalty, claiming he was pushed in the back by Arbeloa, but the referee isn't interested. Replays show that Niang did get a shove, but he should have scored anyway.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong> 90+1 min</strong> An important interception from Pepe Reina, who cuts out a Benoit header across goal which was heading straight into the path of the substitute Samassa.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Pepe Reina saves the day once again, this time with his feet from Mamadou Niang, who really should have scored.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peep! </strong> It's all over - Liverpool get this year's campaign off to a winning start, but hats off to Marseille who gave them a very good game and will wonder how they didn't get a point at least.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>After-amble: </strong>Last word tonight goes to Justin Kavanagh, who wants to know if \"the Carlsberg-free shirts are a new record for Liverpool losing their bottle so early in a season? <em>Probably</em>, eh?\" thanks for your time and your emails, I'm off to correct my typos and insert profanities for Monsieur Franck's English class.</p>",
  "<p>There'll be no mourning for the passing of Snoop Pearson. Shot in the head by Michael Lee and left dead in abandoned SUV, her last words - \"How my hair look, Mike?\" - offered a late and unexpected glint of femininity, of humanity. But no matter, Snoop was an animal, her sole satisfaction gained from killing or, perhaps, the goading of an adversary into inviting their own death. She will not be missed.</p> <p>With Snoop's death, the streets of Baltimore have been swept clear of the Stanfield crew. Michael has absconded, knowing well that what Snoop told him was correct: he was never one of them. The rest, from Marlo, through Chris, Monk and Cheese, are behind bars after the seizure of $18m of heroin, the end result of Lester Freamon's illegal wiretap. They may not stay incarcerated for long, the word on Freamon's skullduggery having begun to spread. While Maury Levy remains at liberty, no criminal charge is safe.</p> <p>It's traditional in The Wire that the criminal story arcs are resolved before the final episode, and that pattern has been followed in the final season. In the past, as in season one, this early resolution has left room for things to fall apart, for the quarry - those not dead at least - to slip the leash. As Maury sits in his office pondering the possibility of flaws in police procedure, you get the feeling it's about to happen again.</p> <p>Even if McNutty's mad efforts and Freamon's fanatical persistence did stand, though, would it make any real difference.? The message from episode nine is: probably not. The final shot of the hour is of Dookie, abandoned by the departing Michael to take refuge with his rag'n'bone man. He walks into the junkyard. And past a man shooting up. The light and sound take on the same hues as on that dark night Bubbles staggered through Hamsterdam, trying to sell white t-shirts in the fifth circle of hell. The look on Michael's face showed he knew what was to happen next.</p> <p>The cyclical nature of events is one of the abiding messages of The Wire and it's heavily reinforced this week; the fact that no matter how many busts are made, how many Marlos are taken down, the system will dust itself off and start again. The irony is that before Dookie makes his descent, Bubbles appears at Narcotics Anonymous to celebrate his second clean year, and finally confront the death of Sherod. His address is brief, but he cuts the figure of a decent man, dressed smartly, using his real name of Reginald. It's a touching moment that passes quickly. As one is saved, another is lost.</p> <p>Is there any prospect for real change? It would surely seem unlikely. But if any tactic might have a chance of succeeding it would be Lester's old maxim: follow the money.</p> <p>A late night assignation between Freamon and Clay Davis - almost as steamy as it sounds - sees a garrulous senator spill on just how the system really works, and his part in it. The money goes out from the dealers, through the lawyers to an offshore bank and back, through the lawyers again, to legitimate investments such as property or, indeed, political projects. Clay, all paper-thin deprecation, suggests he is just a greasy cog in the apparatus and that the real power lies with people like Maury. Only by getting at him might the carousel come to a halt.</p> <p>So let's see where that goes next week. However, not only would Maury seem too canny to ever be caught himself, people like Clay - the black community advocate who dismisses \"ignorant ghetto motherfuckers\" and relishes recounting the way he and Maury once bled Stringer Bell dry - need him to stay in business. Expect the smile to be wiped off Freamon's face yet.</p> <p>\u00b7 Read Steve Busfield's blog on the episode <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/sep/15/television.television\">here</a>.</p>",

Any town that finds itself described as \"quiet\", \"charming\" or \"idyllic\" in the first few moments of any film trailer should really watch its back. It is doomed to disaster - natural or otherwise - and is unlikely to make it intact to the closing credits. In fact, the more nice things said about any location, either in booming voiceover or stark white capitals on a black background, the worse its likely prognosis.</p> <p><strong>\"... AND BOUNDLESS BEAUTY\"</strong> continues the onscreen text. <br>Oh, well it's completely fucked now. <br>Still, it does look like a ruggedly attractive little place, while it lasts, all clifftops and crashing waves, fields of waving grasses and all of that. A car pulls up to a house in the woods, a man - we shall see his name is Russell - joins a family gathering and apologises for missing a funeral. No sign of an HP Lovecraft monster yet. Not one blessed mandible. I wish to complain.</p> <p><strong>\"BUT LOOK CLOSER \u2026\"</strong> Ah, there we have it. Yes, yes, this is what we were waiting for, beneath the idyllic exterior lies a dark and terrifying secret, etc, etc. Don't go in the cellar and all that. </p> <p>Worrying things are happening. Russell appears again, now with a shaved head. This is probably deeply significant, but I'm jiggered if I can tell why. In any case, it at least differentiates him from the crazy old lady with enormous hair (wild hair + dressing gown + white surroundings = trailer shorthand for mental instability needing hospitalisation) who leads him to a video warning him that many generations of Marsh Men have died on the first of May.</p> <p>We spend a while getting excited about these mystical Marsh Men, imagining them to be close relations of Swamp Thing and therefore entirely fitting in a gothic horror film. And then we realise that his surname's Marsh, and get less excited again. Though we do see a hand tearing off a daily calendar to reveal May 1.</p> <p>Winner of the Best in Festival at the Eerie Horror Film Festival (founded 2004), but also at the HP Lovecraft Film Festival. Which, we discover, is a festival dedicated to horror fiction writer HP Lovecraft, his works, and films adapted from them: which, let's face it, can't be more than a handful every year. </p> <p>So yes, it's a nice prize, and every accolade is worth shouting about, but since prizes seem to be given to <a href=\"http://hplfilmfestival.com/h-p-lovecraft-film-festival-awards\">anyone</a> who is nice enough to make a film adapted from or vaguely referencing HP Lovecraft it's a bit like winning an award for being the tallest dwarf. </p> <p>Big letters and moody looking glimpses of a troubled family continue. <strong>DRAWN IN BY A LEGACY HE NEVER WANTED</strong>, is Russell, apparently. We see him sharing a bed with an attractive young gentleman and a dinner table with a tense-looking family. <strong>HAUNTED BY A PAST HE CANNOT ESCAPE</strong>, we learn, though would be frankly happier if he was being haunted by, say, mystical creatures of alien extraction with terrible claws and face-tentacles. As that might be somewhat closer to what it said on the tin. This, meanwhile, is starting to feel more like a trailer for a torturous Annie Proulx adaptation, full of silence and meaningful glances and difficult decisions. Which <em>is</em> scary, yes, but not quite in the way we were expecting.</p> <p>Then, halfway through, Russell wakes up looking alarmed when the alarm goes off - it's only natural - and even more shocked when he discovers what looks like a remote control lying on his chest. A remote control with funny writing on it. Drums beat a dramatic rhythm as the hero apparently makes some quite terrifying discoveries: a room with names written up the walls in chalk; newspaper cuttings of murderous events; the fact that Tori \"90210\" Spelling is in this film. </p> <p>\"You're saying that your dad and his church are killing people?\" says someone else, helpfully.</p> <p>\"They CAME out of the SEA and KILLED lots of PEOPLE,\" Russell says later on, with that exact pattern of emphasis. It's funny, when you hear people putting such actorly emphasis on certain words in a sentence I always imagine them pacing their Beverly Hills mansions practising all the other possible combinations of stresses they could have peppered the sentence with. \"THEY came OUT of the sea and killed LOOOOOTS of people,\" for example, which would just sound bizarre. </p> <p>Suddenly, two-thirds of the way through - after a couple of shots of shapes walking into the sea and walking out of it again, dead people tied to posts and the growing suspicion that Russell's dad is not only a bad man but into some pretty rum shit involving wet corpses - there is a shot of some kind of creature. Non-human creature. It lasts less than second - a flash of light and you can just about pick out some shiny rounded heads and the hint of a tentacle. And that's it. Believe me, I've watched that second 137 times in a row now. </p> <p>Cthulhu? Who can tell? By the time the word flashes up on the screen, we have begun to wonder if the troubled Russell is actually a Professor of Unpronouncable Words, and that's the only connection to Lovecraft and his ultimate embodiment of evil. </p> <p>The unstable old woman with the enormous hair has a bit of a shout. Wild and woolly, she's getting a bit worked up. But what about? Trailers of troubled relationships, families with dark secrets, monsters or no? She seems quite over-excited about the whole thing. She is, we must admit, the only one.</p>",
  "<p>General Ray Odierno, who takes over today as America's top commander in Iraq, played a key role in the \"surge\" strategy that pulled the country back from the brink of anarchy.</p> <p>As deputy to the outgoing General David Petraeus, Odierno carried out the detailed counter-insurgency campaign that poured US troops into Baghdad, drove al-Qaida insurgents out of areas surrounding the capital and clamped down on Shia extremists.</p> <p>The physically imposing Odierno, who will be promoted to four-star general, was a relative latecomer to the hearts and minds techniques of Petraeus. During his first stint in Iraq in 2003, when he commanded the 4th Infantry Division, Odierno was responsible for an area north of Baghdad known as the Sunni triangle, which included Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's home town.</p> <p>Few US military commanders or soldiers have much good to say about Odierno's aggressive tactics. His division's mistreatment of Iraqis and the heavy use of artillery appalled others within the country's armed forces.</p> <p>Army reporters and commanders said Odierno's unit - a heavy armoured division, despite its name \u2013 used an iron-fist strategy that may have appeared to pacify the area in the short term, but alienated large parts of the population. Some argue that the behaviour of the 4th Infantry Division helped create the insurgency.</p> <p>\"Fourth ID fuelled the insurgency,\" an army psychological operations officer told Thomas Ricks in his book on the Iraq war, Fiasco. An unnamed general said bluntly: \"The 4th ID \u2013 what they did was a crime.\"</p> <p>Odierno defended his troops' conduct by saying his men faced a population more hostile than in the rest of Iraq and had to act accordingly. The capture of Saddam in an underground bunker in December 2003 by Odierno's soldiers did little to dispel their cowboy image.</p> <p>The division's tactics contrasted with those of Petraeus, whose troops complemented searches of ex-Baathists' homes with meetings with tribal chiefs and community projects such as rebuilding schools and painting over old murals of Saddam. Petraeus went on to <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf\">rewrite the US military's counter-insurgency manual (pdf)</a> and then took overall command in Iraq.</p> <p>Odierno was slow in recognising the strength of the insurgency at the start of 2004. At the time, he told reporters that the insurgents had been \"brought to their knees\". He was not alone in his overconfidence. A few months later, violence erupted and US forces all but ceded control of places such as Fallujah to the rebels.</p> <p>Later in 2004, the war took a brutally personal twist for Odierno. His son, Tony, an army lieutenant at the time, lost an arm to a rocket-propelled grenade. A West Point graduate, the younger Odierno left the army and went to graduate school in New York.</p> <p>For the older Odierno, Iraq was unfinished business. He returned in late 2006 and redeemed himself by recognising the failings of the US strategy at the time, recommending more troops at a time when the White House was under enormous political pressure to withdraw forces.</p> <p>\"His recommendations for what came to be known as the surge forces have since been proven correct,\" Petraeus said at a ceremony in Baghdad marking the end of Odierno's last tour in February.</p> <p>Odierno is now a convert to the Petraeus approach, telling troops it is their job to protect the population and that counter-insurgency takes time.</p> <p>\"Just as important as the surge was the change in our tactics, techniques and procedures that got us back out in the neighbourhoods,\" Odierno said in March. \"Our mantra was protect the population, protect the citizens of Iraq.\"</p> <p>In his new post he will answer to Petraeus, who will take over in late October as chief of US central command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, Afghanistan and the rest of central Asia. Odierno and Petraeus know each other well: for the final 12 months of Odierno's time in Baghdad his immediate superior was Petraeus.</p> <p>Odierno will be taking over at a time of relative calm. The surge has contributed to a big drop in sectarian violence and the newly confident Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is keen to see the withdrawal of all US combat troops by 2010, although he will probably have to settle for a compromise of 2011.</p> <p>George Bush this month announced a withdrawal of 8,000 US combat troops by February, but that would still leave his successor with about 140,000 troops \u2013 roughly the same as the pre-surge levels of last February. It will be Odierno's job to set the stage for an eventual US withdrawal.</p> <p>Odierno's margin for manoeuvre could depend not only what happens on the ground, but on who wins the US presidential race. He favours a \"conditions-based\" approach to judging US troop requirements in Iraq, taking into account levels of violence, the strength of insurgent groups and changes in the quality and numbers of Iraqi government troops. John McCain, the Republican candidate, backs such an approach, whereas Barack Obama, the Democratic candidate, wants a firm timetable.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>IIt's time to play the music. It's time to light the lights. It's time to watch Chelsea stride in muscular fashion towards a near-inevitable home win against Bordeaux in their opening Champions League game \u2013 despite having had their manager described, amusingly, as \"a puppet\" by his opposite number Laurent Blanc.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>All right, it's not quite a muppet. But muppets are definitely puppets. And Luiz Felipe Scolari is, of course, neither. Tonight is his first experience of the Champions League, but that shouldn't make much difference.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>Chelsea are a well-grooved machine in these kind of contests. Last season's 1-1 draw against Rosenberg aside, they're very strong at home. Bordeaux, for their part, have never scored in England. They're also missing the suspended Mathieu Chalme and Benoit Tremoulinas, who would otherwise probably be playing. </p> <p>Blanc is likely to send his men out to defend, but why wouldn't he? And it probably won't make any difference anyway. The early rounds of the Champions League no longer carry any terrors for the Premier League's big four bruisers. It's almost, perhaps, maybe getting a little predictable. </p> <p>On the other hand, Didier Drogba is suspended, a legacy of having sent off in last season's final (thereby leaving John Terry to miss a penalty he might not have been taking). This is also the kind of game where they might miss Michael Essien: he's been mighty in the Champions League. </p> <p>But probably not.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>Those teams in full. </p> <p>Chelsea: Cech, Bosingwa, Carvalho, Terry, Ashley Cole, Obi, Joe Cole, Deco, Lampard, Malouda, Anelka. <br>Subs: Hilario, Di Santo, Ballack, Ferreira, Kalou, Alex, Belletti.</p> <p>Bordeaux: Rame, Jurietti, Diawara, Planus, Placente, Diarra, Menegazzo, Gouffran, Gourcuff, Wendell, Chamakh. <br>Subs: Valverde, Henrique, Cavenaghi, Bellion, Ducasse, Traore, Obertan.</p> <p>Referee: Pieter Vink (Holland)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Robin Hazlehurst has a joke: \"I used to work in Bordeaux and whenever anyone asked me what my favourite wine was I answered \"I hate working on Sundays\"\".</p> <p>Not bad. The first time, maybe. </p> <p>After that you might want to alternate it with something like, \"'53 Margaux, best of the century\".</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Word is Bordeaux will be playing a 4-3-3 formation here tonight.</p> <p>Hmm. 4-6-0, I reckon. With a bit of Chamakh scooting about on his own up front now and then,. But we'll see.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong><strong> And they're off!!</strong> Early touch for Cech. He's in extremely bright orange this evening. Very becoming it is too.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong> cagey stuff, Chelsea spreading it about a bit at the back, but slowly. Nice to see Joe Cole on the right. But hang on - he's off over to the left now. Eh really is here there and everywhere. Not wearing his bandage either.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Wendell whacks in a shot from 30 yards that smacks Mikel in the head and goes out for a throw. Then he feeds Placente, who crosses low, but it;s cleared. Early sprightliness from the French.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 mins:</strong> Bordeaux look pretty confident. Odd choice of burgundy (hah- see what they're doing) socks with the all-white.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6 mins: </strong> Deco dinks in a pass for one of Joe Cole's new fancy runs in behind the defence. He was quite close to that. Lovely pass.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8 mins: </strong> Chelsea attack quite brightly on the right, where Malouda is now very wide, but the final ball in toward Anelka is awry. </p> <p>Joe Cole does have a big smear of vaseline on his head.</p> <p>Petrit Selimi leans back in his leather chair, eats a piece of mouldy blue cheese and writes: \"Do you know that most Bordeaux wines are meant to remain unopened for ten,twenty, or even fifty years. Very opposite of Chelsea that is much more like new world wines. Not that there is anything wrong with Quintessa, a Bordeaux-style blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, one of California's top reds.\"</p> <p>Er. Yeah. Quite.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> All quiet here. This is a slow burner so far. But wait... Wendell picks up a loose pass near the half way line from Mikel and wallops in a shot that drifts over. He likes a go with that left foot. Sloppy from Obi.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 mins</strong> Gourcuff lurking pointedly for the visitors. He's the danger for Chelsea by all accounts. Played very well for France against Serbia the other day. He's a sneaky, in the hole kind of chap. </p> <p>Chelsea still probing gently, like an expert orthodontist. Bosingwa nutmegs Diawara but his cross is cleared.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>14 mins: </strong> Another Deco dink for the Cole maraud forward. again it;s too long. He really doesn't stop making those runs.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>14 mins: CHELSEA SCORE!!</strong> Bosingwa puts in a lovely low cross around the penalty spot and Lampard gobbles it up to tuck it past Rame. That was simplicity itself.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 mins:</strong> Chelsea in again down the right. They;re all over them on that flank. Such a simple goal. Lampard's a machine for Chelsea. You just don't expect him to miss. Still, clearly, very hungry. </p> <p>Let's hope they don't stop going forward so much, like they might have done under you know who.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> Bordeaux free kick 30 yards out on the right. Wendell again takes a massive swing and absolutely belts it into the wall. He's having a go all right.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Ooooh... nice effort from Anelka. Terry's ball is flicked on by Malouda, Anelka picks it up and hits a skimmer that the keeper palms round the post. From the corner J Cole just can't prod it in as the ball breaks to him. </p> <p>Good stuff form the home team. They look completely in control.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 mins:</strong> Terry heads just wide, completely unmarked from Lampard's cross. </p> <p>Bordeaux look a bit third rate and sloppy right now. Pull yourself together or you'll get a pasting.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> Planus almost pokes iot past his own keeper for no apparent reason. He looks terribly jumpy. Good save in the end by Rame. </p> <p>It's very quiet at the Bridge. Almost as though this is a little predictable.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>24 mins: </strong> Bosingwa is absolutely all over Placente. He is bossing him. Wins a corner but it's cleared.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 mins: </strong> Just give it to Bosingwa. He's a fiend.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Eh? Eh? Cole plays in Anelka with a lovely through pass. Instead of booting it towards goal from a fairly helpful angle, he decides to fool everyone by cutting it miles back across the area to... nobody. </p> <p>Cunning. Too cunning. Should have been a second.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Bordeaux playing really high up the pitch in defence, which is asking for trouble with Deco and Anelka about. </p> <p>After that miss/bad choice Scolari did a huge stroppy arms in the air routine on the bench. Good stuff. Very cross.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>30 mins: CHELSEA SCORE AGAIN!! </strong> All to predictable too. Malouda yawns his way through on the right and cross but it's cleared. From the corner Cole drifts off the goal line and flicks it in ever so easily past the keeper. that was a good header. Brave too, particularly with the vaseline bit on his stitches.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>Joe Cole just can't stop scoring. He's a four for the season goal machine.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> Bordeaux still frozen in the blocks here. They look totally outclassed in these first 30 mins. Chelsea have no obvious weaknesses. Not against this lot anyway.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>34 mins: </strong> Blimey! Lampard misses a gaping goal, volleying Anelka's nod down past the post after another cross in under no pressure from Bosingwa. </p> <p>That should have been five. Or three. Or whatever it is. This isn't a contest right now.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>35 mins: </strong> But wait. Deco gives the ball away near the half way line, picked up by Chamakh, who's hacked down by Carvalho. </p> <p>Gourcuff bends the free-kick over the bar. Not a bad effort from distance. Their best attempt so far. And they must be better than this.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>37 mins: </strong> Bordeaux corner now. It's a rubbish low one and cleared.<br>They left three players up for that corner. Very nice to see.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> It's gone quiet. so quiet we might as well have another Robin Hazlehurst pun: \"Apparently the Bordeaux Blanc is known for its elegance, softness and vivacity. Bit of a change from when he played at Man Utd then\"</p> <p>Not sure about that one to be honest.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong> Gourcuff has another blast at a free kick from miles out and it wangs its way over the bar. Greenshoots of a recovery, but right now this is still a Lehmann Brothers-style collapse from the French</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>42 mins: </strong> nice moment from Cole (Joe) as he robs Gourcuff, one jinking playmaker on another. He looks great again tonight, Cole. <br>Presumably he would give way for Ballack, because he always does. But seems a little unfair.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>44 mins: </strong> Gourcuff's at it again, punting in a long range shot from a free kick. This time he gets a corner, but it's cleared easily. </p> <p>Oliver Pattenden points out that \"Didier's got his iPod on again!\" </p> <p>Wonder what he's listening to. Massively over-produced R'n'B perhaps.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>45 mins: Half time. </strong> And that's it. Not to much an easy day at the office so far. More a half-asleep Friday morning without the boss around playing tetris for three hours than maybe getting a sandwich. </p> <p>Bordeaux will surely pick up a bit. But right now this is a doddle for Chelsea.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>Luke Harber points out: \"I think malouda would give way for ballack...This is the new \"cole in the hole\" position. Now that he's been let off his Mourinho leash he's loving life, playing a free role behind the striker....PS, has anyone else noticed that this Scolari chap can coach a bit?\"</p> <p>Yes, Malouda. Much better. Cole looks extremely lively again. </p> <p>Scolari does look not half bad.</p> <p>For a man who's been given a team full of world class players who came second in Europe last year and haven't played anyone half decent yet. </p> <p>Be interesting to see how he goes later on. </p> <p>Probably very well judging by his trophy haul.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>Lucy (Western Australia) writes: \"It's past 3.30am down here in Oz, I'm starting to wonder if it's worth staying up. Joe Cole and Boswinga are keeping me awake however.\"</p> <p>Yes, we've all lain awake at night tossing and turning and thinking about Jose Bosingwa. Now and then. Maybe just once... </p> <p>Haven't we?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong> We're off again. Chelsea keep the ball in midfield. Scolari wil be wanting more urgency in attack and more goals, I'd imagine.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>48 mins: </strong> Gor blimey. Chamakh goes haring after a pass and goes flying miles over the advert boards and into the crowd. He's OK, but it could have been nasty. All smiles in the end.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>49 mins: </strong> Malouda ghosts away from Jurietti by the byeline and plays in a low cross towards Anelka, but it's cleared. </p> <p>Apparently Jurietti has played five seconds for France. A few years ago. It's a record for shortness of international career. </p> <p>From the look of him tonight it could have been the first five too.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>51 mins: </strong> Oh dear. Gourcuff hits another absolute horror of a free kick into the upper reaches of the stand. He runs off frowning and muttering to himself and looking serious.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> Best moment for Bordeaux. Gourcuff plays in Fernando, who hits a strong low shot that goes past the post of a scrambling Cech. </p> <p>That was more like it. </p> <p>Lovely strike.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>54 mins: </strong> Really pushing a lot more players forward to support Chamakh now Bordeaux. You can see what Blanc will have said at half time. </p> <p>And more space at the other end too. Malouda rampages down the left again and smashes a low ball right across the face of goal. Anelka juts can;t get there.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>56 mins:</strong> Deco robbed by Gouffran in midfield. a bit ponderous there. Has he been up to standard so far this season? Seems to flit in and out a bit from what I've seen, and fade a little too. </p> <p>Bordeaux still looking a lot more fruity, robust, acidic, oak-laden and generally heavy on the nose this half.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>58 mins: </strong>First booking of the game and it's Deco. He pullded back Diawara and then booted the ball away. Tsk tsk. A bit unnecessary that. And some pressure from the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>59 mins: </strong> Lovely interplay between Lampard, Anelka and J Cole. Ends with Cole trying an outrageous bender into the far corner, but it's never going in. God stuff though. </p> <p>Ballack might be coming on.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Great sweeping Chelsea move involving Deco, Anelka and Malouda, ends with Malouda's shot being blocked. Some determined defending there. </p> <p>And here's Ballack on for a slightly sulky looking Deco. Gives him a hug and mooches off.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>62 mins: </strong> Anelka shoots but it's wide. </p> <p>Mac Millings points out: \"Placente clearly provides the nutrition for his team, but when he is spent, he'll be shed, and either eaten, or buried at the base of a tree\".</p> <p>Ugh. Or made into a lasagne and eaten by a hairy, smiling woman in tie-dyed dungarees.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Luke Harber ripostes: \"Not to give away my status as a Chelsea fan, but are you talking about \"Deco\", player of the month for August and man of the match in at least 2 matches so far, including the match against Manchester City? The same Deco who scored a peach of a free kick in his second game and who has generally been magnificent all season?\"</p> <p>Yes, that Deco. Looked a bit off it tonight though. </p> <p>Another long distance effort from Bordeaux, but it's weak and off target.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>66 mins: </strong> Gouffran and Chamakh off, Cavenaghi and Obertan on. Cavenaghi's a tasty Argentine. not sure about the other fellow. Chamakh did well.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>68 mins:</strong> A quiet perio dhere. Chelsea doing a bit of keep ball. Malouda, for all his dispensibility for Ballack, has had a good game wide on the left. He's stayed wider than last season. Nice thinking from Big Phil</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>70 mins: </strong> Nice bit of interplay between Cole and Ballack, but the German can't find Anelka with a pass that wold have had him in. Bordeaux have tackled and closed down with a lot more energy this half. Now the game's over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>72 mins: </strong> Gourcuff and Wendell sliding it about nicely in front of Terry and Carvalho. Mikel, for all his rippling muscles, has been a fairly passive force in midfield. Nice passer. But he hasn't burst forward at all as he might have with so much possession. Essien would be first choice of course.</p> <p>And here comes Belletti getting ready to come on. Loads of talking and pointing from Big Phil</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>74 mins: </strong> He's on for Joe Cole, who very clearly and in TV close-up says \"Oh, for ****'s sake\" and spits on the ground before jogging off clapping and pretending he doesn't mind. Good commitment. </p> <p>Ducasse also on for Fernando.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>76 mins: </strong> Belletti seems to be playing on the right. Anelka still on his own up front. It;s all pretty relaxed out there. Only Scolari looks cross. He's up on his feet. He wants more up-and-at-em. Big game coming up at the weekend.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>78 mins:</strong> Laurent Blanc is still standing on the touchline looking serious. He hasn't moved all night. Wonder if his socks are rolled down beneath his blue slacks. </p> <p>Chelsea work some space on the left and Cole crosses. Away by the leaping Diawara. He's a very big unit.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>80 mins: </strong> Bit more Bordeaux possession, but I'm not sure Cech has had to make a save yet. Not a proper one anyway. Ah. no shots on target, it's official. </p> <p>Just a thought. But what on earth are this team doing in something called the Champions League? They're quite smooth when they get the ball. But really. They're just not up to it. This is not a league of champions kind of match.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>82 mins: CHELSEA SCORE AGAIN!!!</strong> Bang on cue. Malouda finishes really well, smashing it into the corner after after tklaing a back-heel from Lampard. Top set up that. and just before it, a forward surge from Mikel, showing he can do it. Very lively there all round. It's a fair reflection at 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>84 mins: </strong> Malouda's off now and Kalou's on. That was great strike, right in the corner. He's had a decent game, staying out on the wing.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>85 mins: </strong> Some late, going through the motions pressure from Bordeaux but it comes to nothing. </p> <p>Oliver Pattenden points out: \"Surely that's the kind of burst forward from Mikel that should answer your criticism\"</p> <p>But, hah! He's too late. Hands have already been held up. He's taken on board my criticism, had a look at himself and surged forward.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>87 mins:</strong> Carvalho, totally unmarked, heads against the bar from Lampard's corner. He had acres there. </p> <p>They're just not really champions-style material this lot. There's been a lot of slack marking. And that really should have been 4-0.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>89 mins: </strong> David Goldstone's having a pop at my colleague David Pleat and his chalk board on ITV talking about Blanc: \"the English clubs are beginning to show an interest in these foreign coaches\". </p> <p>Yes, yes, only a decade or so out. </p> <p>It's down to walking pace out there.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90 mins: </strong> That was quicker. Belletti bursts down the right very nicely, cuts it back to Anelka and he hits a shot that clips the far post. He'll think he should have got one against this lot at home, with all the possession they've had.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins: AND HE HAS TOO!! CHELSEA GET FOUR!!</strong> Well there we are. Brillaint strike by Belletti from miles out is palmed on to the bar, good stop, but Anelka's following up well and rolls it in. That'll make him feel better.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins: FULL TIME.</strong> That's it. A really quite straightforward 4-0 win that never looked in doubt at any point. Easy, far too easy you might say for a competition like this, but there you are. Lampard and Malouda played well, as did Cole in spurts. Big Phil looked the part. Nobody got injured. Fine preparation for Sunday.</p> <p>And that's all from me for now.</p>",
  "<p>One Sunday last September, I left my apartment building at the top of Riverside Drive on Manhattan's Upper West Side, walked a block south and found myself at the corner of P Street and 17th Street, outside the Department of the Interior. Looking further, I saw a Metrobus stop for the 13A and 13G routes, which run between National Airport and the Pentagon; vending machines for the Washington Post and Washington Times; and John Malkovich, sitting in a buttermilk Mercedes-Benz turbo diesel sedan, wearing a gray suit with blue checks and a pale blue shirt. Behind the car passed traffic and pedestrians. In front of it were the awnings, lights, wheeled doohickies and several dozen millers-about that constitute a film crew.</p> <p>The film crew was for real - Joel and Ethan Coen were shooting Burn After Reading, the Washington, DC-set comedy that opened at the top of the US charts this weekend and is out next month in the UK - but not much else. The items of street furniture were props, of course. The traffic and pedestrians snapped into reverse at the blare of a bullhorn to resume positions fifty yards up or down the street. The Mercedes turned out to be a gas-burner done up as a diesel, and Malkovich turned out to be a stunt driver. The real Malkovich stood at a nearby bench, also wearing a gray suit with blue checks and a pale blue shirt. No, wait. The identically-dressed guy sitting ten yards beyond him in a canvas director's chair, reading a book about Freud - that was the real Malkovich. No question. Wasn't it? Perhaps this is how it feels to be a character in a Spike Jonze film\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337656994\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/15/burnafterjohn460.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich in Burn After Reading\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heeere's Johnny ... Malkovich spies someone watching</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The third man was indeed the real Malkovich, but the second, standing by the bench, was undeniably Malkovish. He had the actor's stubbly, balding head, intense, heavy-lidded eyes, broad nose, and down-turned mouth - though, unlike Malkovich's, his was often stretched into a bright-toothed beam. He was also considerably more built than the star. This was Mark Heskin, a 47-year-old working as Malkovich's stand-in, occupying the actor's space in the frame during the tedious minutes while shots are set up, and sitting around waiting to be called in the hours when they weren't. </p> <p>It was, Heskin acknowledged, a job that had its longueurs, but it was always interesting to be on a film set. Nor was it his only gig: he also worked as a daytime drama background artist - an extra on soaps - and pursued other acting work. For a decade starting from the mid-1980s, he had carved out a niche in the city making caricature dolls, stuffed figures based on people or photographs, equipped with bespoke accessories such as a Gap bag, or a pair of diving fins. Three feet tall, they sold for $150 each. Heskin showed how it was done on a public-access cable program, \"My Craft Show,\" and was profiled by the New York Times in 1992. In 1996, he moved back to his hometown of Portland, North Dakota, restored a couple of houses, then returned to New York last year. Now he has another side project.</p> <p>\"I don't invite many people,\" he said as he handed me a business card, \"but I get the feeling you'd get a kick out of it.\" On the card, which featured a color picture of a tree in the top left corner, were Heskin's name, address, and two words: \"Game Master.\" </p> <p>A couple of Sundays later, I made my way up to his fifth-floor apartment on the Upper West Side, a studio with a distant view of Central Park, if you crane your neck out of the window. Kevin, a corn-fed Yellowstone Park Ranger turned fourth grade teacher, was already there, and the chips, hummus and Canada Dry ginger ale had been broken out. The three of us were enough for the first game: Mad Gab. The concept was unfamiliar to me but easy enough to grasp. I picked up a card, read out A BLINK ON and, before too much sand had trickled through the egg timer, figured the answer as an informal reference to the 16th President.</p> <p>Other guests soon arrived\u2014Dez, a dark-haired, long-faced Irish lawyer; David, a young, goateed organist and doctoral candidate; Tom, short, bespectacled and in dungarees\u2014and our options increased exponentially. There was Password, then Catchphrase, then Scattergories. A gracious but competitive host, Heskin applied rules strictly but was generous in appreciating others' good play. Each game afforded an outlet for his performing abilities, though none so much as the last: Charades. Pulling a folded piece of paper from the hat, he read its contents, and frowned for a moment before beginning. Movie. Three words. First word: a buzzing insect; a wedding ring. Third word: milking a cow; a witch. Aha! \"Being John Malkovich.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last week I may or may not have taken my life in my hands and travelled on foot through Hackney after dark. My point of departure was my home, my destination the <a href=\"http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/312_all_about_ajex.htm\">Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen and Women</a> in Stamford Hill, the venue for a council-organised neighbourhood meeting about youth and crime. My uncertainty about my safety during my walk there and \u2013 in particular \u2013 back again, was familiar. How anxious was it rational to be? I battle often with the nerviness this question arises from, and though I nearly always win I resent the mental struggle involved. That said, it has a certain value: it helps me put myself in other peoples' shoes. </p> <p>I reached Ajex House by way of busy Stoke Newington and twilit huddles of gossiping <a href=\"http://www.jewishtoronto.com/page.aspx?id=36465\">Charedi</a>, from one of which I obtained directions. In attendance were an assortment of Hackney councillors \u2013 mostly <a href=\"http://www.hackney-labour.org.uk/620a0b40-6bc0-b644-35b5-3fb384425db2?PageId=09722b61-aad5-fa74-b5f7-5e9108573281\">Labour</a> (as you'd <a href=\"http://www.hackney.gov.uk/elections-results.htm\">expect</a>), but <a href=\"http://www.hackneyconservatives.com/2008/02/10/new-river-ward-councillor-maureen-middleton/\">Conservative</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hackneylibdems.org.uk/councillorian.php\">Lib Dem</a> too \u2013 and a variety of residents: Turkish, Jewish, south Asian, West Indian, English, Scottish, perhaps 40 people in all. Their collective age profile could be characterised in shades of grey, though there were two upbeat young women from the youth services department and two bright-eyed girl members of the UK youth parliament too. As such occasions tend to be \u2013 whether in Hackney or Harrogate \u2013 the discussion was passionate, eccentric and well-informed by turns. Tea and biscuits were provided. So were key themes and tensions of the current youth crime debate and insights into the corrosive power of fear.</p> <p>In this part of the capital there is deep grief and grave concern. The most recent teenage murder victim here was just 14 years old and appears to have been selected for execution not because he was a rival in criminality, but because of where he lived. Five youths have since been <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7602478.stm\">charged</a>, but that won't have stilled the ripple effect. It's the same with every stabbing, every assault, fatal or otherwise. A police inspector from Hackney's <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/saferneighbourhoods/boroughs/hackney/saferneighbourhoods.htm\">Safer Neighbourhoods</a> team spoke of the impact on many victims' associates, whose instant response to a friend being attacked is to be sure they are armed when they go out. Knowing this, police will pay them a visit. </p> <p>Sometimes, young people like these will be directed towards \"diversionary\" programmes, which is where the youth service comes in. It too is impeded by the grim territorialism that fuels much of the violence and menace. Even perfectly peaceable kids will refuse to cross a street to make use of a facility or provision if it means entering a different postcode area in case they are targeted, particularly if they are boys. Such boundaries, though, are not respected by the shudders of fright and disquiet that spread across the borough and beyond and into the psychology of London as a whole. </p> <p>What is being done? The meeting helped reassure this journalist-citizen that serious efforts are being made to prevent and pre-empt: the police and the youth service co-operate and their policies seem joined-up; schools and youth offending teams are plumbed in too. But are the right things being done in the right way? The borough funds a mobile IT suite called the <a href=\"http://www.thehype.info/purple_bus.html\">Purple Bus</a>, which travels from estate to estate, providing opportunities for youngsters to improve their skills and express their creativity. One woman at the meeting had doubts about it. Wasn't there too much emphasis on making music and writing lyrics? Wouldn't it be better to get them doing sport? Another woman, who runs a youth club with volunteers, complained at the lack of grant support from the council and the complexities of obtaining it. A man blamed the problems on rap. Another called for martial law. </p> <p>I headed home with the usual churn of feelings: comforted by the commitment of those in responsibility, depressed by the state of affairs they have to address, and just that little bit wary of the streets. The police inspector had taken us through the latest stats, showing large falls in \"knife-enabled\" crimes reported across London and an especially large one in Hackney. I held these figures in my head as I avoided eye-contact with a boy teenager with a mean-looking dog and a young woman yelling abuse at someone on the opposite side of the busy, garish, Lower Clapton Road. </p> <p>Neither threatened me, just as no one ever has in over a quarter of a century of living around here. Everyone else was going about their business \u2013 shopping, talking, walking home like me \u2013 without fuss or disturbance. The only small harm done was to my morale. The teenage stabbing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/15/knifecrime\">phenomenon</a> may be largely localised, against the larger trends and even turn out to be a passing phase. Yet it is surely too a specific symptom of a malaise so deep and so ingrained in dark, depressed backwaters of our capital city that it will take decades of applied, political effort to address it and the fears it feeds. As the party conference season continues, do we see signs of such an effort being made? In fact, I think we do. Just nothing like enough of it.</p>",
  "<p>European regulators have confirmed that they are investigating the online advertising deal brokered between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/google\">Google</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/yahoo\">Yahoo</a>, following similar moves by the US department of justice.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal, which was announced in June, Google will be able to sell advertising on its rival's website in return for a share of the profits. That prospect has angered both rivals and customers of the two companies, who believe that the terms of the agreement could hand too much power over to the increasingly dominant Google.</p> <p>A spokesman for EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said yesterday that an inquiry into the $800m (\u00a3445m) agreement between the two Silicon Valley giants had been launched over the summer. </p> <p>\"In mid-July we decided to open a preliminary investigation on our own initiative into potential effects of the Google-Yahoo agreement on competition in the European Economic Area,\" Jonathan Todd told Reuters, adding that there was no deadline for the investigation to conclude.</p> <p>The news comes just a week after it emerged that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/03/microsoft.microsoft\">US department of justice was conducting its own investigation</a>, and had hired a prominent Washington litigator to oversee proceedings.</p> <p>Sandy Litvack, a well-known lawyer who headed up the US government's antitrust team under Jimmy Carter and more recently sat on the board of Disney, has been brought in to advise a team examining allegations that the arrangement is anti-competitive.</p> <p>The appointment of Litvack - a renowned 72-year-old trustbuster - is an \"ominous sign\" for Google and Yahoo, according to one prominent antitrust lawyer who spoke to Guardian.co.uk.</p> <p>David Turetsky, a former US deputy assistant attorney general who specialised in antitrust cases under the Clinton administration, said that Litvack's reputation was a good indication that the government meant business.</p> <p>\"If the department of justice really bring him in at this point to work on the Google-Yahoo matter, then it's a very ominous sign for the parties concerned,\" said Turetsky. \"The department has brought outsiders in on other occasions and sometimes they've filed a suit and sometimes they have not.\" </p> <p>However, with the investigation already running for several months and apparently considered a high status case \u2013 which has allowed investigators to issue subpoenas for evidence \u2013 Turetsky said he believed the chances of an eventual suit were high.</p> <p>\"In those cases where no charges have resulted, it's typically nearer to the beginning of an investigation,\" said Turetsky, who is now in private practice with Washington law firm Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf. \"I don't think they'd bring someone that senior in without the possibility of filing a suit.\"</p> <p>Yahoo responded to news of the Brussels investigation much as it had the US inquiry, saying that it would cooperate fully with the demands of investigators. Google, meanwhile, brushed aside the news by saying that the terms of its deal would have no impact on the European advertising market.</p> <p>\"The agreement is limited in scope to Yahoo's US and Canadian websites, and it will not have any significant effect on Europe,\" said Google in a statement. \"We are, of course, cooperating with the commission and are confident that they will reach the same conclusion.\"</p> <p>The deal has drawn criticism from advertising groups and newspaper organisations, which argue that it hands an unfair amount of control over the online advertising market to a single company. </p> <p>Among those complaining most vociferously about the Google-Yahoo matchup, however, is rival Microsoft - which sees the deal as a serious threat to its own plans. Not only does it further relegate prospects for Microsoft's own search advertising business, but the agreement between the two Californian companies was widely seen as an attempt by Yahoo to fend off Microsoft's aggressive $44bn takeover bid. That was eventually rejected by Yahoo's board in August, and Microsoft has been bitter in its criticism of the deal since then.</p> <p>\"Never before in the history of advertising has one company been in the position to control prices on up to 90% advertising in a single medium,\" said Brad Smith, general counsel at Microsoft, giving evidence to a congressional committee.</p> <p>\"Ultimately, the long-term ramifications of this deal would undermine the very diffusion of power the internet is supposed to promote.\"</p> <p>Despite public statements in which it has said it will work with government lawyers, Google has taken an aggressive attitude towards the plan, saying that it plans to implement its scheme by October.</p> <p>That may prove foolhardy, said Turetsky, who cautioned Google against angering the department of justice unnecessarily. </p> <p>\"Acting like this at the informal and cooperative stage is one thing,\" he said. \"In a more formal investigation, announcing your own deadlines to the department is an unusual approach. One can understand the concerns about being left in limbo, but it sounds like the department is being challenged here.\"</p>"
