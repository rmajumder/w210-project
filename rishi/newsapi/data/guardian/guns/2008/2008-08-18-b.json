Leave all your cellphones and cameras here.\" Not, perhaps the most terrifying sentence with which to open a trailer, unless you're waiting for a call. Or fear courtyards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336734452\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/dayearth4200.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" width=\"200\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>00:20:</strong> \"I thought it was important to have you part of this team. Don't be afraid,\" says a man in a long shabby coat. \"Afraid of what?\" says Jennifer Connolly, flawless in tight black leather, doubtless thinking that if being on this gentleman's team involves a dropping in hygiene and associated fashion standards then yes, that is quite scary.</p> <p><strong>00.25:</strong> You know what she might be afraid of? The fact that the damn picture keeps fading in and out. Presumably it's partly because maybe they haven't finished the movie yet and they were trying to stretch it out over a whole two minutes. Or maybe it's meant to be atmospheric. It does feel rather a lot like trying to watch something while falling asleep, or while someone's spinning a very loose motorcycle helmet on your head - which, I imagine, would be a deeply annoying thing to do. And it is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336734453\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/dayearth3140.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" width=\"140\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>00.35:</strong> Sitting at a normal-sized table, in the dead centre of an extremely large room, Keanu Reeves is sitting wired up to a lie detector and being questioned by a man with strawberry blonde hair and glasses. Is that Jerry Springer? What kind of questions can he possibly be asking? The usual Springeresque ones mainly related to questions of paternity, perhaps? Or questions of a long-lasting family feud based on someone running off with someone else's wife and/or sister? </p> <p><strong>00.41:</strong> \"Are you currently in a seated position?\" says Jerry Springer, clearly feeling the need to build up to the difficult and juicy infidelity questions rather than dive straight in. \"Yes\" says Keanu Reeves, robotically. Sorry, that's a tautology, isn't it? </p> <p><strong>00.43:</strong> The questions get no more juicy, but slightly more odd. \"Do you feel pain?\" asks the man I'm starting to suspect might not be Jerry Springer after all. \"My body does\" replies the K-man. \"Are you human?\" says 'Jerr. \"My body is,\" comes his reply.</p> <p>And I think we can all safely assume that Keanu, then, is an alien trapped in an action star's body. Something else, then, that means there's an in-built plot-based reason why the man acts like a plank of wood with a hard on. Like that other film where they removed his entire brain and replaced it with secret information. Or the one where he played a brain-dead rock-star with the IQ of a remedial bee. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336734454\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/dayearth2200.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" width=\"200\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>00.53:</strong> \"General Quinn needs to see you in the briefing room. He says it's urgent,\" someone whispers, urgently, in the ear of Kathy Bates. This is great. We have no idea who General Quinn is, and why anything might be urgent, nor, in fact, who Kathy Bates might be and why anyone might want to see her, urgently or not. I mean, no offence, she's very good - Oscar good, in fact. I just meant in the context of this trailer. </p> <p><strong>01.05:</strong> \"Are you aware of an impending attack on planet earth.\" Asks the Springer lookalike. Actually, that's not quite true, what he asked was, \"Are you. Aware. Of an. Impending. Attack. On planet. Earth.\" Leading Keanu to stare at him with a mixture of evil, menace and complete blankness that only he can carry off. This impels him to ask the question again, though not, apparently, to question whether Keanu's just staring at him and wondering why he talks so damned slowly.</p> <p><strong>01.10:</strong> Outside in the big wide world, there are funny shapes being made in a CGI sky, with CGI lights drifting across the horizon and looming over exactly the same familiar US skyscrapers that always get targeted in these kinds of movies. They probably have a special insurance clause for the most familiar places. The Third Party, Fire, Theft, Aliens and Meteor cover plan. However, it is reassuring when you live in other places in the world, isn't it? Because based on this trailer, the rest of us should be fine. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336734455\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/dayearth5220.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>00.11:</strong> However, there are a large group of people dressed in full-body condoms who seem to have noticed something amiss, and they're seeming like they might be foreign (to the US, not to where they're from, obviously) so perhaps we're not safe after all.</p> <p><strong>01.21:</strong> \"You should let me go\" says Keanu, reminding us that someone asked him a question some time ago, though this doesn't exactly answer it. I think we (and General Quinn) can probably take that as a yes, though. </p> <p><strong>01.30:</strong> Particularly as the next wee while is entirely taken up with things blowing up, or, worse, kind of collapsing in on themselves as if pulverised by some kind of vibration or nuclear wind. First a lorry - which is, at the end of day, just a lorry so quite difficult to get worked up about. Then an American Football field, which, again, doesn't really affect the rest of us one way or the other. Then the lights go out across San Francisco, which is probably alarming to those living in San Francisco or planning on moving there, but shouldn't affect you overly much if you live in, say, Wokingham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336734456\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/dayearth6160.jpg\" alt=\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" width=\"160\" height=\"245\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>01.41:</strong> DECEMBER 12. Says the big writing on the black background - a familiar sign, reminding us, in fact, that there's been a complete lack of the other usual thing - no voiceover this whole trailer. And you can see why: you could get Don LaFontaine in, but what are you going to ask him to say? \"<strong>It seemed like just an ordinary Monday morning, but suddenly \u2026 Aliens blew everything up. And, you know, boom! And that.</strong>\" Which would be brilliant, obviously, but I think this rather explains itself, they're right.</p> <p>IS. It says. THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Which at least gives you a handy date to remember not to stand near any famous skyscrapers, lorries, or San Francisco.</p> <p><strong>01.50:</strong> We end on a line from Keanu, just so we're completely aware who the star is, here. \"If the earth dies, you die,\" he tells Jennifer Connolly and a remarkably cute little kid she seems to have picked up, somewhere, because it is a end-of-world film cliche and thus necessary to do so \u2026 \"But if you die, the Earth survives.\"</p> <p>And there we have it. Well, apart from a couple more explosions there we have it. Does it look good, based on trailer alone? It looks like an end of the world movie. Not like the original Day The Earth Stood Still, particularly. Just like all the other end of the world movies inbetween. So December the 12th. Don't forget. See you in Hull. No one ever blows up Hull. Look after yourselves. And each other.</p>",
  "<p>For years, Tony Blair drove schools policy in his own characteristic direction. Sure, there was money for new schools, but the headline-grabbing ideas were all about freeing schools from the grip of local authorities to compete for pupils whose parents were to be given as much choice as possible. </p> <p>Academies became the flagship policy, designed to attract business involvement on the one hand and churches on the other. It was all resolutely unsocialist.</p> <p>But there are signs that the left is fighting back, using the powers granted to trust schools by the Blair government in a most un-Blairite way. The new school year will see the cooperative movement backing its own trust schools. It hopes to have 100 up and running in two years' time.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the children, schools and families secretary (and a Coop Labour MP) is lustily singing the praises of cooperative trust schools. And, with delightful irony, David Cameron's Tories are also promoting them. They really are flavour of the month - though one wonders if Balls and Cameron are talking about the same concept.</p> <p>The cooperative movement has been active in education for some time, already sponsoring 11 business and enterprise colleges. Reddish Vale technology college, near Stockport, became the first cooperative trust school in March.</p> <p>Now it's moving up a gear. Five other secondary schools have announced they intend to become cooperative trusts: Sutherland school, a business and enterprise college near Telford; Campsmount technology college near Doncaster; Nab Wood school in Bingley, West Yorkshire; Lipson community college in Plymouth; and St Clere's school in Thurrock, Essex. Many more schools are expected to follow. </p> <p>While cooperative schools are a relatively new idea in the UK, they are very popular abroad. Spain has more than 600, some parent-led, others teacher-led, while in Sweden, they have proliferated since the reforms of the early 1990s. </p> <p><strong>100 in two years</strong></p> <p>Mervyn Wilson, chief executive and principal of the Cooperative College, the movement's education and training arm, thinks cooperative trusts will take off in the UK. \"We expect 10 more trusts to be in the formal consultation stage by September, and a minimum of 100 schools to be up and running within two years,\" he says.</p> <p>For Balls, the concept means \"embedding a collaborative culture into the school\" and building on existing strong local relationships. He says: \"Schools that collaborate with other schools, colleges, universities, businesses and the wider community are already seeing the benefits. I think there is significant future potential for a cooperative model based on collaboration and a greater involvement of parents and the local community in the running of schools.\"</p> <p>Despite the almost socialist rhetoric behind aspects of the model, the Tories are also strong advocates and Cameron has promised to create more. \"I want to explore how we can create a new generation of cooperative schools - funded by the taxpayer but owned by parents and the local community,\" he says. </p> <p>He has dismissed any contradiction between cooperative trusts and Conservative policy, arguing that they are in keeping with the Tories' notion of social progress, being \"strong, independent institutions, run by and for local people\".</p> <p>Unlike academies, trust schools remain part of the local education authority, are funded like other maintained schools, follow the national curriculum, and are inspected by Ofsted. They can join forces with businesses, charities or other public-sector organisations and have powers to employ staff, own buildings and set their admissions policy. </p> <p>Although academies offer greater autonomy, this was not an attractive option for Reddish Vale. \"Although a new building would have been fantastic, the majority control of an academy sponsor seemed to go against a movement for greater community inclusion and involvement,\" says Phil Arnold, the school's deputy head.</p> <p>Indeed, all five prospective trust schools say one of their main reasons for signing up is to involve a wide cross-section of the local community. None has a private-sector partner. Instead, in addition to the cooperative movement, their partners include colleges, primary care trusts, local authorities and charities. </p> <p>\"It is not about a dash for cash,\" says Steve Baker, headteacher at Lipson community college. \"For some firms, their aim seems to be to make money and influence the curriculum and policy to their advantage. We are not seeking to mortgage the future of our children in this way.\"</p> <p>Although cooperative trusts are free to set their own admissions policies, in practice, their collaborative ethos means they will still work with councils to ensure they adhere to the national admissions code. </p> <p>Parents, staff, pupils and the wider community are encouraged to become members of the trust. This makes them owners of the school. They can appoint a school council, which chooses school trustees, two of whom sit on the governing board alongside trustees from the partner organisations.</p> <p>\"The trust allows parents to become involved in the school and gives more of a voice to pupils,\" says Chris Hill, 16, a pupil at Reddish Vale. \"Other people who wouldn't normally be associated with the school can still get involved. It brings the whole community together.\"</p> <p>The model emphasises collaboration with other schools. Sutherland and Lipson have taken this further and hope to form their trust with a number of local schools. Lipson's proposal involves seven primary schools, while Sutherland will be a cluster of at least eight schools, possibly more. </p> <p>\"I am confident the trust will build and improve on the way we all work together to improve the quality of life for our school, our community and its residents,\" says Nicola Scott, a governor at Sutherland school. It is a view shared by students. \"I think it's really good for schools to work together,\" says Vicky Handley, 15. \"You can achieve more.\"</p> <p>The cooperative movement wants to promote its values in the classroom. \"Our values can make a difference in raising standards, aspirations and achievements in schools,\" says Peter Marks, chief executive of the Cooperative Trading Group. Pupils and teachers say a more collaborative ethos will help to bring people together and reduce antisocial behaviour. </p> <p>At Sir Thomas Boughey high school, a cooperative business and enterprise college, the rate of those getting five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C has increased from 46% in 2004 to 79% last year. The head, Dave Boston, attributes some of this success to becoming a cooperative school, a view reiterated in its 2006 Ofsted report. \"The school's specialist status and the strong link to the cooperative movement have had a major impact on standards and achievement,\" the inspectors noted.</p>",
  "<p>First, in early August, there are the usual pre-emptive strikes with news stories about A-level standards slipping. Then, on results day, we get the familiar refrain: the pass rates are up again, exams must have got easier. This year the popular line was: \"the exam you cannot fail\". </p> <p>It has been this way for years. So this time, just for a change, I decided to ignore it all. Instead of attending the annual news conference, I went to the beach. Instead of fuming at the newspapers, I bought none (well, except the Guardian, of course). In fact, I almost forgot to check on my daughter's results. </p> <p>After 20 years of trying to find a news story for the TV and radio each August results day, it was a relief to treat this day for what it really is: a day of thousands of individual stories, some happy, some sad, but rarely ever a genuine national story. </p> <p>That's because in August we get the statistics for the pass-rate only as a percentage of those candidates who actually attempted the exam, not of the whole age cohort. Percentages in the upper 90s are only to be expected ever since the Curriculum 2000 reforms, which mean you now know at the halfway stage of AS levels whether or not it is worth continuing to A2. </p> <p>It is like an Olympic finals event. Of course, everyone gets a good time; that was the whole point of having qualifying rounds. At A-level, the AS also serves as a qualifying round, diverting virtually all those unlikely to get at least an E grade to alternative routes. </p> <p>Seeking any sort of news angle, some observers focused on the problems for some universities in distinguishing between candidates with three A grades. There is a genuine issue here. But it is not new and it affects only a tiny percentage of university admissions. And, anyway, the government had already decided some time ago to bring in the new A* grade to deal with this.</p> <p>So is this annual non-news story bound to continue for ever? Perhaps not. Because maybe it will soon be apparent that this preoccupation with A-levels is at odds with the reality for growing numbers of people. </p> <p>For a start, it is galling to the Scots, who have their own qualifications. It must also seem odd to all those who choose other routes, either vocational qualifications or apprenticeships. In fact, less than half of all 17- to 18-year-olds in the UK take A-levels. </p> <p>And that number is likely to fall further from this autumn, as many more options are placed before academically inclined youngsters with their eyes on a university place. For them, the A-level is now just one platter on a veritable smorgasbord of post-16 qualifications. </p> <p>From September, the first sets of students will be able to opt for the new diplomas. Soon these will be available in all schools and, indeed, every student will be legally entitled to take a diploma course from 2013. </p> <p>Other students will, from September, have the first chance to try the Pre-U, the latest post-16 qualification to rival A-levels alongside the international baccalaureate, the Welsh baccalaureate and the AQA baccalaureate. </p> <p>So, come August 2010, will it really make sense to make such a fuss about A-level results when hundreds of thousands of students, indeed the majority of 16- to 18-year-olds, will not be taking them? </p> <p>This is not to say that we should not be interested in national standards. Of course we should. But these statistics come later, when we can see what levels have been achieved across the whole age cohort in a variety of different qualifications. </p> <p>The national obsession with A-level results day could be dismissed as a bit of harmless summer fun. But there is a risk that this focus on one particular qualification, taken by a minority, suggests that other courses and exams are not worth taking. </p> <p>We need young people to take the courses and qualifications that are right for them and are valued by employers. In Germany, they have always esteemed the quality of apprenticeships and vocational qualifications. Here we seem to think that nothing else exists outside A-levels.</p> <p>Let's hope that is now changing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mike Baker can be contacted at <a href=\"http://www.mikebakereducation.co.uk/\">mikebakereducation.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>A British soldier on foot patrol was killed by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan yesterday, the 116th to have been killed there since 2001 and the 22nd since May. </p> <p>The latest British victim of a seemingly resurgent Taliban was in the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland but attached to 1st Btn the Royal Irish Regiment, the Ministry of Defence said. It said the soldier was part of a joint British/Afghan army mentoring liaison team patrolling in the Gereshk area of Helmand province.</p> <p>The device was detonated as the soldiers dismounted from their vehicles. Three others - another soldier from the international force, an Afghan soldier and the patrol's interpreter - suffered shrapnel and blast injuries. The dead soldier's next of kin have been informed but he will not be named until today.</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel David Reynolds, the UK military spokesman in the area, said: \"Everyone in Task Force Helmand is affected by the death of a soldier, and the thoughts and sympathies of us all are with the family at this most difficult time.\"</p> <p>The death was announced as the MoD released more details about an incident involving British troops on Saturday in which three Afghan civilians were killed. An Afghan woman and two children died in the Sangin area of Helmand province when UK forces fired rockets at Taliban fighters. The soldiers were unaware that civilians were near enemy fighters in a local compound, the MoD said. A further four civilians were injured. </p> <p>\"This was a tragic incident. A family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians, particularly women and children, are involved,\" Reynolds said. </p> <p>\"While it is unclear exactly what caused their death, an investigation is under way. What is clear is that Taliban fighters were in the area and showed a total disregard for the presence of civilians near them.\"</p> <p>Daoud Ahmadi, spokesman for Helmand's regional governor, Gulab Mangal, was quoted by the MoD as expressing sympathy for the deaths and blamed the Taliban's \"ruthless tactics\" for incidents involving civilians. He said: \"The Taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk. They have no regard for the Afghan people and support for the Taliban in Helmand is reducing.\" </p> <p>The shooting incident took place when troops from 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment tried to prevent an imminent attack on them, according to the MoD. Taliban fighters were identified on the ground and three rockets were fired, defence officials said. </p> <p>One of the injured children received specialist treatment at the hospital at the British base of Camp Bastion and was then flown to the French-run Mother and Children's hospital in Kabul and was reported to be recovering. </p> <p>Attacks by foreign forces, mainly from aircraft bombs, have killed civilians as a result of poor intelligence, inappropriate weaponry, and Taliban fighters' tactics of surrounding themselves with civilians.</p> <p>The number of Taliban attacks has increased by 50% in the first half of this year compared with last year, according to independent human rights and aid groups based in Kabul. Some 260 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in July, more than in any other month in the past six years. </p> <p>About two-thirds of reported civilian casualties can be attributed to the Taliban, according to the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief. More strikes by international military forces, up by about 40% on last year, have also contributed to a rising civilian death toll, the agency said in a report released this month.</p>",
  "<p>When I was about seven, growing up in Krakow, Poland, I was taken to my first piano lesson. I no longer know what impelled my mother to do so. It was the kind of thing that aspiring middle-class parents did for their children, as a way to assure proper cultivation, and perhaps some upward mobility. But for me, it was instant enchantment. There was the piano itself - a polished baby grand, and undoubtedly the most beautiful object I'd seen in anyone's house, in a materially bleak postwar Poland (my Jewish parents had survived the Holocaust by hiding in Ukraine). But it was when the rather unprepossessing woman who was to teach me sat down to play that I suddenly felt I was in the presence of magic. The sounds emanating from under her fingers had the loveliness, and liveliness, of a quick-flowing mountain brook. Then there was the precision, the sheer control she was exercising to produce that pearly stream of sound. Even as a child, I could see that there was a kind of mastery in that, a personal authority.</p> <p>\"All art aspires towards the condition of music,\" Walter Pater famously pronounced, and many artists and writers have testified to the potent impact of music on their work: as an art that can touch on the deepest sensations of which we are capable; an aesthetic ideal in which form perfectly coincides with content; a subject or stimulus for specific work; and sometimes, a concrete aid to creativity. </p> <p>Certainly, for me, a musical education has been one of the formative experiences of my life. For various reasons, it got complexly inter-braided with writing and literature, so that I no longer know which came first, or what would have happened if; or which exercised a greater fascination. I was always a word-besotted child, and as soon as I could read myself, especially the kinds of books which came from Krakow's old lending libraries, and sometimes had yellowed pages, I plunged into the tales between the covers as if into three-dimensional reality. </p> <p>Then came that music lesson, and, when I was deemed prepared enough, admission to the Krakow Music School, which was considered a grooming ground for future professional musicians. There, I discovered that music revealed worlds of emotional expressiveness, formal richness and technical challenge that were as vivid, as utterly compelling, as anything I had known. I did not have anything like perfect pitch, and balked at practising for hours; but for some reason, every shift of mood or tonal modulation in the pieces I played affected me as though they were conveying the keenest, most piercing messages. I never wondered what - or what kind of thing - a Bach Invention, or a Tarantella by a no-longer-remembered composer, said. That was perhaps unwittingly right of me, for music rarely \"says\" anything. But music speaks; and to me, as a child and young adolescent, it seemed to speak all beauty and human passion. </p> <p>When I started playing some of the more accessible pieces of Mozart, or Chopin or Beethoven, I seemed to summon a palette of feelings - tenderness, fury, robust joy, gentle melancholy - distilled to their most intense, their somehow absolute form. This was undoubtedly an illusion, for I had not yet experienced anything that would warrant such knowledge. But it is the mysterious power of music that it can evoke, through its lucid vocabulary of melody and harmony, discord or counterpoint, a range of sensation, intimation and emotion, with an immediacy that made me feel as though I was myself participating in its large and subtle drama. </p> <p>I'm afraid that, as I grew into adolescence, I sometimes indulged in fantasies of standing on stages in beautiful silk dresses. But while being trained as potential musicians in that warm, old-fashioned school, we students were given to understand that we were being inducted into a high and serious calling. Music, in postwar Poland, had enormous status and significance. For one thing, in a climate in which so much was forbidden, classical music was a permitted form of expression (the story on such western forms as rock'n'roll was more complicated). In an important way, music stood outside the sphere of political slogans and prevailing political falsehoods. And, in a country that produced Chopin and Paderewski, and which prided itself on its romantic spirit, the sheer love of music often reached a pitch of almost spiritual fervour. When the Chopin competition restarted in 1955, it quickly became a national event, with much of the country's citizenry glued to their radios, listening to the young performers, and parsing the opinions of the jury for political mendacity or prejudice. </p> <p>The Polish cult of music - particularly of romantic pianism - reached one of its peak moments in 1958, when Arthur Rubinstein made his first visit to Poland since the war. Rubinstein was an iconic figure: a native son who had achieved worldwide fame, who had now decided to return, and who was first and foremost known for his ravishing interpretations of Chopin. Indeed, to many, he seemed to be practically channelling Chopin, with a stunning immediacy, intimacy, elegance and grandeur. </p> <p>Rubinstein's concert in Krakow during that visit was one of the most memorable experiences of my early life. The concert hall was so overcrowded, and so heated with excitement, that at least one person fainted and had to be carried out. After the announced programme, members of the audience began shouting out requests for encores - culminating with Chopin's Polonaise in A major, which had been played over Warsaw's megaphones during the brief and hopeless moment of resistance against the Nazi invasion in 1939. At the end, the audience broke as one into a birthday song that says \"may you live a hundred years,\" and which basically meant, \"we love you\". Somehow, political, historical and musical meanings came together in that concert hall, making for a moment of collective transport that has since then been matched only by the Beatles or Bob Dylan. </p> <p>For me, shortly after that concert came emigration, to Canada and the US, and all the attendant dislocations, changes of direction, disorientation. In a radically changed environment, I continued for a while to study music; give student recitals, and even to play with orchestras on a few occasions - an experience that, it must be said, can spoil you for a while for the more mundane occasions of life. I also learned to thrill to other kinds of music, including some of those wicked, western ones. </p> <p>For a while, my piano teachers continued to be among the most important figures in my young life, as they had been in Poland. Music teaching is a true form of mentoring. It happens through an exact, close-up, hands-on process - sometimes literally so. I had one teacher of the Russian school, who guided my responses to the music through movements of his hand on mine. But in guiding your hand, the music teacher, to some extent, guides your self; and I learned all kinds of extra-musical lessons from this process: about the necessity of reining in my impatient excitement, if I wanted to give musical phrases their right breath; about how strict discipline frees up spontaneity; about the combination of effort and receptivity needed to learn about something, or perhaps even someone, outside yourself. In his book, The Craftsman, Richard Sennett notes that in playing an instrument, one needs to \"release\" the finger on a string or a valve; and that the idea of release, which travels from the physical to the mental, \"is also full of ethical implication, as when we surrender control - our grip - over others\". But then, it is one of the deep pleasures of learning music that it encompasses and calls upon all aspects of the self: physical, cognitive, affective. </p> <p>I did not, in the end, go on to become a professional pianist; I slowly started turning towards writing instead. How that happened is a story involving a few twists and turns, immigrant circumstances and youthful conflict. Perhaps I felt uncertain, especially after the upheavals of emigration, whether I could achieve the peerless brilliance of Maurizio Pollini, Alfred Brendel or Mitsuko Uchida. But there was also, as I went on to college and graduate school, my newly reawakened love of literature and ideas; and, just as saliently, the need to deal with my new, tense romance with language: the English language. It was one of the powerful lessons of emigration that language is not only something you use, but something that lives within you, that shapes your perceptions, and constructs your very self. Without it, I lost my conduit to my own subjectivity. And so, I wanted badly to recreate in my second language the relationship I had to my first. In a sense, I wanted English to become a fully expressive instrument; and for that, I needed to learn not only its vocabulary and grammar, but its inflections and rhythms, its specific music. </p> <p>That took a long time. But when I started writing, I found that music had become embedded in my mind, or cells, as a sort of template, a psychic paradigm for what I wanted, however presumptuously, to achieve in my new medium. There was the music of the language itself, which I wanted to mould, and which mattered to me perhaps all the more because it took me a while to become attuned to it. But there were also other, sometimes elusive qualities, which I wanted to transfer from music to words: a certain smooth fluency, whereby each note elides into the next with apparent seamlessness; the sense that a verbal, no less than a musical composition, needs to find its voice, its tonal register, which corresponds to some subtle pitch of mind, a perspective, or atmosphere; and that each work should strive for a form which arises from its thematic content, and gives it a fitting shape. </p> <p>Of course, as Pater knew, most forms of expression rarely attain the felt form, the condensed meaningfulness of music. Writing, especially in the extended medium of prose, almost necessarily deploys the materials of explicit narrative. It talks of specific situations or events, of \"what happens\", and sometimes what will happen next. Music also unfolds in time, and contains development, reiterations, turns of theme. But it rarely makes an argument, or \"tells a story.\" Its meanings are built through a self-referential, inner logic. Writing is made of discrete particles of perception; music can sometimes say everything at once, can express both grief and joy in the same chord. </p> <p>It is such disparities that make it famously difficult to write about music. And yet, eventually, I wanted to do just that; to try to translate into words the fantastic force I feel within music, and also, the all-absorbing experience of playing, of stepping right into the universes of Schubert, Bartok or Chopin. I have found it a great pleasure, as well as a great challenge, to attempt this. I don't think the utterly sensuous, and utterly impalpable nature of music can be described directly. But in writing about a pianist, I wanted to follow her from within, as she moves through the tensions and resolutions of the compositions she plays, their trajectories of mood and movement, their alternations between turbulence and serenity; and as she falls into states of mental and bodily concentration in which she almost becomes the thing she plays, and achieves moments of what can be only called transcendence. </p> <p>But I also wanted to explore the Janus face of romanticism, the way that the quest for transcendent meanings can lead to the drive for violence, as well as for sublimity. In my novel Illuminations, these two polarities meet - and eventually, terribly collide - in an encounter between Isabel Merton, the protagonist, and her increasingly fanatical nationalist lover. Because music adumbrates meanings rather than ideas, it is rarely ideological; but its intensities have appealed to extremist ideologues of all stripes. Lenin apparently loved Beethoven's Appassionata. But in another sense, music is the opposite of extremism, or the simplistic reductiveness of violence; a great composition can include anger and even rage, but it contains these within complex and multi-layered form; and almost always, the music we love works its way through the darker emotions to a more reconciled acceptance. </p> <p>Still, playing, and performing, can be heady stuff. For about a year after I made the decision to give up music professionally, I could hardly touch the piano, for fear that it would remind me of lost plenitude. Then I started playing again, less methodically, but with great enjoyment. And since then, I have found that writing, for all its arduousness, can also take you up whole. On a personal level, it has allowed me to explore new corners of the world; and also, aspects of memory and history, moral problems and social issues which have mattered to me intensely. It is the stretching demand of the linguistic medium that it allows you, indeed, calls on you, to apprehend experience in many dimensions, and in many kinds of ways: through discursive ideas as well as lyrical compression, from a critical distance as well as through empathy, by trying to grasp the realities of the external world, as well as the interior riddles of individual subjectivity. </p> <p>Luckily, there is no incompatibility between the two. Writing is something I now struggle with every day (well, almost every day). But music continues to be a source of pleasure, and sometimes profound meaning. Its origins seem to go back far into our evolutionary development, and its patterns seem to be deeply encoded in our neurological and biological substance. In his book, Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks, a physician and neurotherapist, hazards the guess that this form of love is akin to \"biophilia\"; that we have a natural affinity for music, as we have for organic life. Music, in his poignant case studies, heals the worst symptoms of dementia; it helps post-encephalitic patients to organise their movements; in cases of severe memory loss, it often remains after everything else is gone. It is as if music has the power to shape and bring into focus our neurological systems, to pattern, through its structured motion, the patterns and dynamics of our interior lives. </p> <p>I cannot listen to music when I write; it funnels me too completely into itself. But I would find it difficult to live without a piano. However, the piano is there, providing reassurance that music is one of the infinite resources, of which there never need be a shortage; there to draw on for contemplation, consolation, release, and even inner health.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Illuminations </strong>by Eva Hoffman is published by Harvill Secker at \u00a316.99</p>",
  "<p>People start to write because they think they can change the world for the better. In the end, you find that it's hard enough to make your writing better. Occasionally, though, you can change something, even if it's only yourself. You probably already know this story: a group of prisoners in Auschwitz convened a rabbinical court, put God himself on trial - and found him guilty. I'm pretty sure now that it's an apocryphal tale, one of those stories that persists because it strikes a chord. It certainly struck a chord with a producer called Mark Redhead, who had been trying to turn the story into a film for almost 20 years by the time he called me in 2005 to write the screenplay. </p> <p>Three years on, the result, called God On Trial, airs on BBC2 early next month. As courtroom dramas go, the story has its drawbacks: the accused is not going to break down under cross-examination, or confess all in tears. On the other hand, as Redhead pointed out, both the World Trade Centre attacks and the Boxing Day tsunami had seemed - in their different ways - to put God back on the world stage and raise again old questions about justice and suffering. The timing was right, but I wasn't sure about his choice of writer. Nearly any other screenwriter in the country would have been only too happy to Dawkins up some diatribe about the badness of God. But as a Catholic, I'm actually quite fond of him and felt uncomfortable about acting for the prosecution. </p> <p>Two academic rabbis, Dan Cohn-Sherbok and Jonathan Romaine, changed my mind. They introduced me to a long Jewish tradition of wrangling with God, going right back to Abraham bargaining with him over the destruction of Sodom, and forward to Elie Weisel's famous declaration that God was hanged on the gallows in Auschwitz. Here were people talking to God on a frequency that wasn't on my dial. The trial of God would not have been some blasphemous aberration, but something in the tradition of the psalms, the Book of Job and even Christ's terrible accusing cry from the cross: \"Why have you forsaken me?\"</p> <p>Although the subject of the guilt of God is universal, when it came to writing I confined myself to imagining this particular trial: the problems of setting up a court in a blockhouse, the kind of arguments that those men might have advanced. I focused on the Covenant, God's special deal with the Jewish people. I thought I was doing this to keep faith with the story - but maybe I was also doing it to distance it from my own spiritual life. The magic of stories, though, is that the more specific you are, the more universal they seem to get. The Covenant turned out to be a really good way of talking about anyone who expects anything from God. </p> <p>Instead of the usual snappy dialogue, I wrote speeches that ran for pages. To get them right, I had to read the scriptures: the Torah, the Talmud, everything. I assumed that doing so would enrich my own spiritual life. It almost killed it stone dead. I thought I was familiar with much of these texts, but reading them straight through was a different experience. Here was a God who was savage and capricious, who chose favourites then dropped them, who set his people ridiculous tests. And the people! A full account of social etiquette during the time of the book of Genesis would have to include an entry under: What to do when the neighbours come round mob-handed demanding to have sex with your visitors. The answer is: Offer them your virginal daughter instead. </p> <p>As a writer, I was thrilled by this: free stories! Shocking, bloodthirsty stories of ancient atrocities, stories that almost everyone has forgotten. The screenwriter side of me was happy all day. But the good Catholic side of me was being beaten black and blue. I thought my faith was invulnerable. I've been through family illness. I've witnessed cruelty. I read Darwin all the time and find it feeds my faith. Richard Dawkins makes me want to pray, the same as Homer Simpson makes me want to exercise - for fear that I, too, will end up like him, a whining pub bore with the prose style of an internet conspiracy theorist. The first real challenge to my faith came from reading the scriptures. It may seem deliciously ironic to you, but for me it was a time of a permanent headache and no sleep. I felt that half of me was dying. </p> <p>I was anxious, too, about the Holocaust setting. George Steiner warned writers against using the Holocaust to give a story spurious extra significance and emotion. So I tried hard to keep the script as theological as possible. All the things a screenwriter is supposed to do, I did the opposite. I was vague about the setting. I tried to avoid creating interesting characters. I gave them no history except where it served the argument. When I was pitching, I said: \"It's not about the Holocaust, it's about God.\"</p> <p>Then we went to a muddy ex-military base near Glasgow and started shooting, and all that changed. The minute you saw actors - even well-fed actors with familiar faces - in those uniforms, all the intellectual theorising went straight to the background. The director, Andy de Emmony, shot the film as if it were a play, using multiple cameras and going for 10-minute takes. He was getting through 15 to 20 minutes of script a day instead of the usual four or five. In film, the recreation of reality normally takes place in the editing suite; here, it was happening on the set, in the midst of a bunch of human beings. As the human dimension that I'd pushed to the back came to the fore, I wondered what it said about me as a dramatist that I hadn't seen this coming. Making the complex, contradictory human experience the first consideration - it's more or less a definition of drama.</p> <p>So God On Trial stopped being about theological arguments, and became about the fact that people might be capable of having a theological argument on the way to the gas chamber. In Vasily Grossman's novel Life and Fate, there is the story of a doctor who is giving someone long-term treatment for cataracts, even though she knows that both she and her patient have only days to live. Is this idiot optimism, self-deception, or a heroic refusal to submit to the dehumanising process? And where does that heroism come from? It's a fact that, although many people lost their faith in the camps, just as many had it renewed. As French philosopher La Rochefoucauld says: \"A great storm puts out a little fire, but it feeds a strong one.\" Reading the Bible in the light of the Holocaust was a bit of a storm for me. It came close to putting out my fire, but in the end it blew stronger.</p> <p>I didn't tell you the end of the story. After they find God guilty, one of the rabbis says: \"So what do we do now?\" The reply is: \"Let us pray.\" Is this a wry story about Jewish stoicism? Is it about a failure of moral courage? Or what? For me, it's about faith. Faith has had a bad press of late. It's been used by politicians as a rationale for going to war without reason, because it \"feels right\". That is not faith - that's a hunch, plus vanity. The Final Solution was conceived as a public health project; its perpetrators thought it was a dirty job, but someone had to do it. No matter how extreme it was, we should remember that the rationale was completely in line with the then \"best practice\" in eugenics. People who are now humanist heroes - Marie Stopes, for instance - were of the opinion that the gene pool needed cleaning (she stopped talking to her son when he married someone with glasses).</p> <p>The camps tried to reduce individuals to components in a project. In the end, they did that literally. What good stories do is the opposite. They say the human is irreducible. Tobias Wolff has described the story of the Prodigal Son as \"surely the most beautiful thing ever written\". No one hears it without feeling the conflict between the need to do right by the eldest son, and the need to express the overwhelming love you feel for the lost one, now returned. The father is nothing without the son. That contradiction is crucial. I'm hoping that God On Trial is a mirror image of that story. Only this time it was God who seemed to go away, and people who - inexplicably perhaps - were prepared to rush out to welcome him back.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 God On Trial</strong> is on BBC2 in early September.</p>",

  "<p>Yesterday's radio featured two engrossing urban stories with very different moods. <strong>City Messengers </strong>(Radio 4), a beautifully produced documentary, glimpsed into the lives of cycle couriers. The toughness of the job was made clear (\"most people quit in the first week\") but the portrayal - a rich soundscape of music and traffic noise, plus intriguing slivers of interview - left you associating it with wanderlust and non-conformity. It was hard not to like Will, 43, who has been a courier since 1992. He doesn't mind when people are snooty about his job, seeing it as a \"really quick way of sifting out that I'm not going to get along with [them]\". </p> <p>In <strong>Gun and Knife Crime: Seeking Solutions </strong>(Radio 4), instead of a sense of freedom in urban living, there was only hopelessness for the young gang members interviewed by Winifred Robinson. Some of these children are growing up as second-generation drug dealers, a scenario which makes well-meaning intervention almost impossible.

  "<p>By stepping in to become chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley, Richard Pym is taking on one of the toughest jobs in the City.</p> <p>The lender is in the 90% club - its shares having lost this amount from their peak of 536p - to just over 55p. Investors will be hoping Pym, who retired from Alliance &amp; Leicester last July, will work enough magic to put some sparkle into the share price after more than 70% of the shareholders shunned the rights issue.</p> <p>Bid speculation might be an answer, which Pym a trained accountant, will be used to handling after spending 15 years at A&amp;L. He was finance director when A&amp;L converted from a building society and floated on the stock market 10 years ago and spent the past five years as chief executive.</p> <p>Pym, a decisive but cautious individual, is expected to arrive without preconceived ideas. He is unlikely to sell the bank easily. He was on the A&amp;L board during discussions about an ill-fated deal with Bank of Ireland and as chief executive refused an approach from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole. When he retired he insisted A&amp;L had a strong independent future, but the management team he groomed has since agreed to a \u00a31.3bn takeover by Spain's Santander.</p> <p>The main criticism directed at him was that he was too pedestrian at A&amp;L. His growth targets were regarded as being unambitious . They have since been abandoned as the credit crunch has hammered A&amp;L's prospects.</p> <p>Pym also has a reputation for steadying ships. When he became chief executive in 2002, A&amp;L had been without anyone with that title after the ousting of Peter White in a row over the failed Bank of Ireland deal. John Windeler acted as executive chairman and appointed a Lloyds TSB executive as managing director. Pym's arrival into the chief executive's seat marked a change in strategy accompanied by a simple but effective move to publish the lender's best prices in branch windows. A&amp;L largely shunned high loan-to-value mortgages and only copied Northern Rock's controversial 125% mortgage product last year as the credit crunch started to bite.</p> <p>When he announced his retirement from A&amp;L at the age of 57, Pym would say little about his plans, other than a quip about selling programmes at the Arsenal football stadium.</p> <p>He had privately told friends he had one more job in him and would have been chief executive of Northern Rock if private equity house JC Flowers' bid for the now nationalised lender, had succeeded.</p> <p>A retailer by background - he made his name as an executive director of the Burton Group in the late 1980s - Pym is also chairman of Halfords.</p> <p>He might yet achieve his stated aim of retiring before 60 and lose his reputation for caution if he can find a buyer for B&amp;B in the coming year. </p>",
  "<p>China's greatest symbol of sporting success - the hurdler Liu Xiang - limped abjectly out of the Olympic stadium yesterday, forcing a stunned, disappointed and angry host nation to come to terms with the loss of its most coveted medal.</p> <p>Injured and weighed down by the expectations of 1.3 billion people, the defending 110 metres hurdles champion barely made it out of the starting blocks in his first-round qualifying heat before tearing off his competitor number and hobbling off the track. </p> <p>The stadium crowd of almost 90,000 people, who had been roaring their support for the home-grown hero only seconds earlier, were reduced to a disbelieving silence. Newspapers later showed people crying and television viewers - many of whom had stopped work to watch - staring at their screens in dismay.</p> <p>Chinese journalists were in tears at the press conference as Liu's coach explained that his protege of 12 years had succumbed to a chronic inflammation in his right achilles tendon and a bone spur. \"We have done everything possible. We did our best,\" said Sun Haiping between sobs. \"This is a very hard moment for all of us.\"</p> <p>It was the end of a dream for China and the start of a furious bout of soul-searching as many turned against their former hero or blamed his failure on media hype, commercial pressure and state propaganda. Online comment - the freest and wildest guide to public opinion - was unforgiving. Tens of thousands logged on to express their views and, according to the two main portals, Sohu and Sina, the overwhelming majority were critical.</p> <p>\"We have been expecting you to perform in 2008, but now we just watch you quit. If you really want to dedicate yourself to the country, you would crawl to the finish line. But you always meant to lose,\" said a commentator in the Baidu chatroom. Another accused Liu of playing with the country's emotions.</p> <p>Many were furious at the secrecy surrounding the injury, which only came to light over the weekend, although his coach said the runner has been suffering from the problem for many years.</p> <p>Liu was lambasted as \"fake\", \"embarrassing\", \"deceiving people by telling everyone he was in good shape\" and spending so much time doing commercials that he had become a better actor than a runner.</p> <p>Cooler heads called for calm, saying China was still on course to top the gold medal table. The hosts have 39 golds so far, largely in weightlifting, shooting, judo and diving, but none were as sought-after as a second victory for Liu.</p> <p>Liu was the face of the Olympics as well as a source of national pride. His victory in Athens in 2004 announced China's arrival as a sporting superpower when he achieved what no Asian man had previously managed - a gold on the track, matching Colin Jackson's 11-year-old world record as he did so.</p> <p>His boy-next-door grin now beams down from billboards across the country as he endorses Nike, Visa, Coca-Cola, Cadillac and, most controversially, cigarettes. The value of a gold medal in Beijing for Liu was calculated at 1bn yuan (\u00a378m).</p> <p>His withdrawal will also take much of the buzz out of the games. \"I sympathise with him enormously,\" said Wang Xiaoshan, a writer with Sports Illustrated. \"This is such a pity. My guess is that it is the pressure from 1.3 billion people which hurt him. I don't think it has much to do with the injury, for even if he was injured he would have had time to recover. I think he might have psychological difficulties.\"</p> <p>Liu's former coach, Gu Baogang, blamed an over-intense training regime and pressure from political leaders on athletes to succeed. </p> <p>Although he is Olympic and world champion, Liu has struggled with injury all year and lost his world record in June to Dayron Robles of Cuba. Their expected encounter in the final on August 21 was billed as one of the great showdowns of the games. </p> <p>Fans who paid up to 7,000 yuan ($1,000) to be present are distraught. \"I have eight tickets. They are now nothing,\" said Qiu Jiafeng, a 25-year-old accountant. \"This is a pity for everyone in China. We all expected him to win.\"</p> <p>Outside a sports shop, where the main display featured a gold figurine of Liu, customers were more forgiving. </p> <p>\"I had an image of him as a powerful, handsome man. That hasn't changed,\" said Wang Yinan, a student. \"I can understand why some people are angry but I don't agree with them. I think Chinese people put too much pressure on Liu. This has changed the way I think about athletes and the Olympics.\"</p>",

  "<p>Malcolm Walker knows a thing or two about dishes best served cold.</p> <p>Almost exactly four years after being ousted from Iceland, he wrested back control of the frozen-food retailer in 2005 after fronting a takeover backed by retail conglomerate Baugur. Now he is back at the door of Woolworths, a company that fired him when he was a 21-year-old management trainee.</p> <p>It emerged over the weekend that Walker had made a formal written offer for the retail chain three weeks ago, again with backing from Baugur, which already has a 10% stake in the company. Woolworths issued a statement on Sunday branding the offer \"unacceptable\". He offered in the region of \u00a350m for the 800-strong chain, although it has performed so poorly in recent years that some analysts consider it to be virtually worthless.</p> <p>But the bid got the Woolworths share price - which has lost 70% in the past year - moving again, something that management at the company has failed to do for some time. The shares closed 11% higher at 7.39p.</p> <p>The takeover plan would be to split the struggling high street retail chain from Woolworths' more successful entertainment divisions. The books and music distribution business EUK and the 2entertain joint venture with the BBC to publish DVDs of the broadcaster's shows, including Planet Earth and Top Gear, would be left in the rump of the business. </p> <p>If Walker succeeds, Iceland and Woolworths would be run as separate businesses. Walker intends to become chief executive of Woolworths, leaving Iceland to one of his deputies, and attempt a turnaround many think is impossible.</p> <p>When Baugur bought the Iceland chain, which had then been renamed Big Food Group, it was considered a similar basket case to Woolworths. A source close to the Icelandic investors said: \"People thought Big Food Group was dead. Now look at it. Woolworths is still a resonant brand with consumers and retailing is about getting the basics right. It would be very tough to turn this business around as part of a public company and as part of a larger group. It needs time out of the limelight.\"</p> <p><strong>Rebranded</strong></p> <p>Full details of the plans are unclear, but Walker would turn over part of the stores to food to take on the big grocers that have moved into town centres. Reports suggest some Woolworths would be rebranded as Iceland stores and others into one of Baugur's other high street brands, which include House of Fraser, Hamleys, Karen Millen, Mappin &amp; Webb, Goldsmiths and Oasis.</p> <p>Walker, who had founded Iceland in 1970, had been preparing to move into semi-retirement in 2000, settle into the chairmanship at the company and spend more time with his wife in their mansion near Chester. Instead, his reputation was shredded when he sold half of his shares in the company for \u00a313.5m only weeks before a profits warning and he found himself out of a job. He has always denied any wrongdoing and a Serious Fraud Office investigation was dropped in 2004. Now though, at 61, he seems to be working harder than ever.</p> <p>Since returning to Iceland, Walker has got the business back on track. When Baugur bought the group in 2005, sales had declined by 10% on the previous year. He returned the chain to its frozen food roots, ditching the likes of cigarettes, flowers, newspapers, fresh food, toys and pet food. He cut 900 jobs, abandoned a home shopping division and closed stores in Ireland. At the end of June, independent market research data showed sales at the frozen food chain were up by 12.4% on the same month a year earlier. Tesco by comparison is showing sales growth of 5%. </p> <p>Walker spotted the potential of frozen food early on. He started selling it through a shop in Oswestry he called Iceland while he was still working at Woolworths in Wrexham. In a recent interview, he said that few people locally had freezers at the time, which meant he would sell the produce loose for shoppers to buy for that night's dinner. When the management at Woolworths found out about his sideline, they sacked him, and he started running Iceland full-time.</p> <p>Woolworths, by contrast, continues to suffer. Sales at Woolworths in the six weeks to the end of July were down by 6.7% compared with the previous year. The retail division generates \u00a31.7bn in sales but makes no money. Woolworths is valued on the stockmarket at just under \u00a3108m.</p> <p>In an effort to restore some of the wonder of Woolies, the chain last week hired the former boss of the DIY chain Focus, Steve Johnson, as chief executive. He replaces Trevor Bish-Jones, ousted in June after failing in six years to find a winning formula for the chain, which sells everything from sweets to DVDs, children's clothing and saucepans. Woolworths has already laid out plans to focus on its smaller and medium-sized stores, away from big-city centres.</p> <p><strong>Complications</strong></p> <p>Woolworths has examined the possibility of breaking the business up and insiders say it is not unwilling to engage in talks on the retail chain. But there are a number of obstacles to the Iceland bid.</p> <p>As well as arguing that the offer undervalues the chain, Woolworths complains that Walker and Iceland want the rump business to retain the entire pension liabilities for the group. It has a pension deficit of \u00a345m, which would widen without the cash flow from the retail division, meaning that nothing would be left from the proceeds of a sale. </p> <p>Further, Woolworths argues that the rump business would be left shouldering too much debt. Then there are the complications of its leases. Most are held by the Woolworths retail group, but 145 are held by the holding company and cannot be transferred to a new owner, which means that the rump company would be left with contingent liabilities. \"They want to pickpocket the retail chain,\" said one source.</p> <p>Iceland and Baugur are apparently not about to back off. \"This is now a long game,\" said one executive familiar with the bid, though they are unlikely to make another move before Woolworths' next results on September 17. They hope that other long-suffering Woolworths shareholders will apply some pressure to the board and force the retailer to the negotiating table. </p> <p>Matthew McEachran, a retail analyst at Kaupthing, expressed little surprise at the bid. He said the trend among the big grocers to develop convenience chains meant there had been a lot of interest in the Woolworths property portfolio. The question is, he said: \"How much do Woolworths have to give away for someone to take the problem off their hands?\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>When <strong>Frank Woolworth</strong> opened his first UK store in <strong>1909 </strong>in<strong> Liverpool</strong>, no item was on sale for more than sixpence - 2.5p in today's currency. The chain expanded rapidly until it became the stalwart of the high street, selling everything from sweets to music and toys. The well-known advertising campaign <strong>\"the wonder of Woolies\" </strong>was introduced in the 1970s. But in recent years Woolworths has lost its way and is no longer a first-choice destination for any product apart from, perhaps, toys. Almost anything on sale in its more than 800 stores is available elsewhere better or cheaper, or both. Woolworths' former boss Trevor Bish-Jones launched a <strong>Big Red Book </strong>catalogue service at stores in an unashamed attempt to mimic its rival Argos's formula. Woolworths sales have been falling for four years.</p>",
  "<p>Two men accused of killing the British honeymoon couple Ben and Catherine Mullany on the Caribbean island of Antigua last month were remanded in custody yesterday.</p> <p>The pair, 20-year-old Kaniel Martin and 17-year-old Avie Howell, were remanded in custody for a week by magistrates in St John's, the Caribbean island's capital, charged jointly with murder, robbery and receiving stolen goods.</p> <p>Prosecutors say the handling charge relates to the newlywed couple's mobile phones and a digital camera, which were allegedly found in the men's possession. </p> <p>Mrs Mullany, 31, died from a single gunshot wound in what police said was a bungled raid on the couple's holiday cottage at the exclusive Cocos resort on the island's west coast on July 27, two weeks after their wedding in Cilybebyll, south Wales. Her husband, also 31, was also shot and was flown in a coma to Morriston hospital, Swansea, where he died on August 4.</p> <p>\"Although people have been charged, there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up,\" said Detective Inspector Mike Cranswick, an officer with South Wales police who is in Antigua assisting the inquiry.</p> <p>Inspector Cornelius Charles, a spokesman for the Royal Antigua and Barbuda police force, said the charges followed cooperation between local police officers and a team of eight detectives and forensics experts from the Welsh force and Scotland Yard. </p> <p>\"The investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion,\" he said.</p> <p>The accused men live in Golden Grove, near the resort where Mrs Mullany, a newly qualified doctor, and her trainee physiotherapist husband were attacked on the last day of their two-week honeymoon. </p> <p>The defendants appeared in court barefoot and in handcuffs and Howell spoke only to tell magistrate Keith Thom that he had no legal representation. Both nodded when asked to confirm their names.</p> <p>Ralph Francis, a lawyer representing Martin, said his client would plead not guilty. \"All I will say is that my client maintains his innocence,\" Francis said. </p> <p>Under Antiguan law, the men face weekly remands until the country's director of public prosecutions deems the case ready for trial. Police prosecutor Wendel Robinson said he expected a trial to begin within six months.</p> <p>A 31-year-old woman remained in custody last night but Charles was unable to say whether charges would follow. The three were among eight people arrested last week following information given to detectives by two women aged 32 and 22, who were subsequently charged with handling property stolen from the Mullanys' holiday villa.</p> <p>The families of the victims welcomed news of the charges in a statement. \"We were informed this morning of the news from Antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing,\" it said.</p> <p>The two victims were buried together last Wednesday in a private service at the St John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll, where they had exchanged their wedding vows a month earlier. The families said they were planning a separate memorial service for relatives, friends and work colleagues.</p> <p>Philip Rogers, the Swansea coroner, has opened and adjourned an inquest into their deaths.</p> <p>Antigua has been plagued by a rising murder rate - 19 in 2007 and 13 so far this year from a population of about 85,000.</p>",
  "<p>More than 2 million pensioners will lose up to \u00a3100 this year as a planned rise in the pension credit is wiped out by inflation, the Tories claimed yesterday. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said it was a sign of how Britain had become less fair over the past decade under Labour.</p> <p>In a document entitled An Unfair Britain, Osborne claimed that this year's 4.2% increase in the guarantee credit - a minimum income for poor pensioners - would be \"eaten up\" by inflation, which hits pensioners harder. Inflation for pensioners is between 5.2% and 5.6%, meaning that a couple will lose \u00a398 this year and a single pensioner \u00a390.</p> <p>The document says: \"Labour's taxes and rising cost of living mean that pension increases for poor pensioners will be entirely eaten up by higher inflation.\" Pensioners were suffering because they \"spend a much higher percentage of their income on high-inflation goods like heating, light and food.\" </p> <p>The document is designed to attack Gordon Brown on his abiding political philosophy - the pursuit of fairness. In a speech to the centre-left think tank Demos tomorrow, Osborne will say that Brown can no longer portray himself as the champion of fairness after a decade in which Britain has stepped backwards in key areas.</p> <p>He will say that Brown has failed even on his \"narrow definition\" of fairness - the promotion of equality - because the number of people in deep poverty has risen by 900,000 since 1997; the gap in life expectancy between the rich and poor is the highest since the Victorian age; and the poorest fifth of households pay more of their income in tax than any other group. Osborne said last night: \"The truth is that Gordon Brown's old-fashioned leftist idea that 'only the state can guarantee fairness' has led to a decade of top-down state control policies that have made the country less fair. Brown's Labour means an unfair Britain.</p> <p>\"This autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that Gordon Brown's obsession with his own short-term survival does not do long-term damage to Britain. That would not be fair.\"</p> <p>The Tory attack comes after Labour launched the first wave of an autumn assault on David Cameron. In a Guardian article yesterday, the Treasury chief secretary, Yvette Cooper, warned that \"Cameronomics\" was designed to hide a \"red meat\" Tory agenda of tax cuts behind pretty photo opportunities. The government said last night that 1.5 million more pensioners would be in poverty had Labour followed the Tory approach of simply uprating the tax and benefit system. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"In 1997 the poorest pensioners lived on \u00a369 a week. Today pension credit means no pensioner need live on less than \u00a3124 a week.\"</p> <p>In a book published yesterday, Cameron says binge drinking is making many cities uninhabitable. \"It's like the Wild West,\" he says in the book, based on conversations with GQ editor Dylan Jones.</p> <p>Asked how much he drinks a week, Cameron says: \"Moderately, but probably more than I'm meant to. The unit count is sometimes quite challenging. I like having a couple of glasses of wine in the evening with dinner. Most nights I'll have a couple of glasses of wine.\"</p>",
  "<p>One would have to be a fairly determined news avoider not to clock, at some level, that Madonna has just turned 50. Never mind that life expectancies have risen in the developed world, and living to one's half-century is not the achievement that it once was; this is Madonna's half-century, and attention must be paid.</p> <p>The interesting thing, however, is how vitriolic much of this attention is, and where that vitriol is coming from. Take Camille Paglia, for instance, writing in Salon last week of the \"horrifying paparazzi pix of Madonna's wan face looking as resculpted as a plastic doll\", and of the \"brassy\" cover image for Madonna's latest CD, Hard Candy, \"with that ostentatiously exposed crotch and hard-bitten face lolling its tongue like a dissolute old streetwalker ... still hammering at sex as if it's Madonna's last, desperate selling point.\" Or Julie Burchill (not one, it is true, to be relied on for a consistent or fair point of view), who began by inveighing against Madonna's \"vile veiny hands, that sad stringy neck - yuck!\" then proceeded to bring up the crotch shots in Madonna's 1992 book, SEX. \"Visions of that greasy muff, which one could easily have fried an egg on without benefit of oil, haunt me till this very day.\" Germaine Greer, writing in the Sun, called her the \"elderly mother of Lourdes, nearly 12, Rocco eight, and David Banda, nearly three\". Since when did elderly mother (of a 12-year-old, meaning she was 38 when she had Lourdes) become a term of insult? At least two of these women would call themselves feminists.</p> <p>What exactly has Madonna done to deserve this? Perhaps the answer lies in the hopes they had for her (and themselves) 20 years ago. In 1990, Paglia wrote that Madonna \"has taught young women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising total control over their lives\"; she celebrated the snook Madonna was cocking at \"the puritanism and suffocating ideology of American feminism\": Madonna, proclaimed Paglia, \"is the [real] future of feminism\". And now they feel betrayed by what that future held: Catholicism replaced by Kabbalah; one-night-stand babies by marriage and stately homes; a vigorously pursued desire not to look old (by clinging to the in-your-face sexuality she pioneered). </p> <p>So Paglia castigates her for not maturing with grace; Greer for never being what she seemed: \"Madonna was a middle-class girl pretending to be tough, a religious girl pretending to be irreligious, a prude pretending to be a pervert, a control freak pretending to be out of control.\" </p> <p>In fact, she's doing what they liked her for in the first place - going her own way, fighting her own fight, mores be damned. Trouble is, it's their mores she's breaking, and they don't like it one little bit.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Gallery </strong><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/music/gallery/2008/jul/30/madonna.popandrock?picture=336082414\">Fifty pictures</a> to mark 50 years of Madonna</p>",
  "<h2>A question of attitude</h2> <p>Tom Kemp's claim that all Oxford tutors would give the benefit of the doubt to an applicant from an underprivileged background (Oxford is doing its best to widen participation, August 12) is undermined by the statistics in Alan Ryan's letter printed just below it, which show that applicants from such backgrounds have the same chance, no more, no less, as those from private schools (possibly less if selective state schools are taken out of the equation).</p> <p>Perhaps students would be more persuaded about the attitudes of Oxbridge staff if they were not referred to as \"kids\". The issue is not academic commitment by students, but their perception of the social gap. </p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge are fighting their own history, their dominant brand, and the image of their own graduates in the wider world. Streetwise students seek institutions closer to their own self-image, and - in the case of those from FE, and those who are older, or taking vocational qualifications - universities that acknowledge the validity of their previous life choices.<br><strong>Ian McNay</strong> <br>University of Greenwich, London </p> <p>Tom Kemp and the other admissions tutors at Oxford and Cambridge colleges should be congratulated. The effort and resources they have put in to furthering access to state schools is huge. As a forward-looking comprehensive in Essex, we have developed a top universities programme for our most able students. We have been great beneficiaries of the munificence of Oxbridge colleges in the way of year 10 aspiration days, college and departmental open days, teacher days, public lectures and four-day residential courses for nine of our year 12 students this summer - all free. This has resulted in helping our students to raise their aspirations and being engendered with a \"why not me\" attitude rather than an \"Oxbridge won't suit you\" one so clearly imbued in the subtext of Polly Toynbee and David Walker's article the previous week. </p> <p>Our school has increased its Oxbridge acceptances from an average of two or three a year to five in the past two years, as well as a significant increase in the number of students going to leading Russell Group universities. If this were to be repeated in only a small proportion of state schools, it would change the sterile independent versus maintained sector debate. Other state schools should take advantage of the generosity of Oxford and Cambridge and get students to raise their aspirations. <br><strong>Daniel Lear</strong> <br>Davenant foundation school Loughton, Essex </p> <h2>The joy of adult learning</h2> <p>As minister for lifelong learning, Bill Rammell really ought to know the difference between \"lifelong\" and \"adult\" (Shaping adult learning, August 12). Having mentioned \"adult learning\" and \"adult skills\", he goes on to \"the needs of employers and learners\", but immediately disparages \"the short course undertaken primarily for the joy of learning\", showing that he's mainly concerned with the needs of employers. But, at 73, I am one of the many who still enjoy learning rather than earning.

  "<p>Ian Fisher, like three-quarters of a millon other 16-year-olds, is waiting to get his GCSE results in two days' time. But, education-wise, that is where the similarity between him and the vast majority of his peers ends, because Ian has never set foot in a school. </p> <p>In a lifetime of home education, the only formal lessons he has experienced were evening classes at his local college in Reading to help him prepare for the English and physics GCSEs he sat this summer. He studied for a maths GCSE last year and was awarded an A.</p> <p>Learning at home, when he feels like it and without the restrictions of a curriculum, is \"much more efficient\" than studying at college, purple-haired Ian says confidently. \"The main difference between my informal education at home and my formal education at college has been that at home I can focus on what I want to learn, when I want to learn it.\" </p> <p>Ian's mother, Jill, took her eldest daughter, Elizabeth, out of school at the age of five in 1992. She decided her child just wasn't ready for a day that finished at 3.30pm, and saw that she was losing the ability to occupy herself.</p> <p>Fisher gave up her job as an archaeologist and opted to educate her three children at home. The family lived on the salary of her husband, Peter, a university professor.</p> <p>Elizabeth has just graduated with a fine arts degree, and Ian's other sister, Katherine, is about to start her second year of an environmental science degree. Katherine and Elizabeth were awarded As for most of their GCSEs and A-levels. </p> <p>When they were young, Jill read to her children and took them to museums and to play with others their age. They amused themselves, to a large extent. \"There were never any lessons at home, or anything structured for more than a couple of weeks,\" she says.</p> <p>The Brookes parents, from Gloucestershire, have also home-educated their three children: Joe, 18, Freya, 16, and Lindsey, 13. Joe is about to study for a diploma in interactive games design at college and Freya starts her A-levels at college in September. Their parents, Fiona and Peter, earn enough as foster parents to stay at home to educate them. </p> <p>\"The school system is so geared to competition,\" says Fiona. \"It produces robots.\" Her decision to home-educate was met with a mixed reaction from her family, many of whom are teachers. </p> <p>\"Days go by in the same way that they would in the summer holidays for other children,\" she says. \"One of my children might be outdoors with the chickens, another may be looking after the pets, and the third may be on the computer.\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, the exact number of children learning at home is unknown. Local authorities are not required to find out. But experts say as many as 50,000 children are learning at home in the UK - a figure that has trebled since 1999. </p> <p>The methods employed by parents vary enormously. Some imitate schools to such an extent that they ring a bell in the morning; others allow their children to do exactly as they please all the time. Many have kept their sons and daughters out of school because they believe formal education starts too early in this country, and that it is restrictive, with a misplaced emphasis on testing. Some worry their children may be bullied.</p> <p>Critics of home education dismiss it as a hippy option that disadvantages children socially and educationally for the rest of their lives. So a book just published by academics at the Institute of Education, University of London, is highly controversial. It argues that home education is a viable alternative to school up to the age of 14.</p> <p>Alan Thomas, a visiting fellow in the institute's department of psychology and human development, and Harriet Pattison, a research associate, conclude that informal learning at home is an \"astonishingly efficient way to learn\", as good if not better than school for many children.</p> <p>\"The ease, naturalness and immense intellectual potential of informal learning up to the age of middle secondary school means they can learn certainly as much if not more,\" they say in How Children Learn at Home.</p> <p>Thomas and Pattison interviewed and observed 26 families who home-educated, between them, more than 70 children. Some had been out of school for a couple of years, others had never been inside a school. Most were British, but a handful were Irish, Australian and Canadian.</p> <p>The authors discovered that these children absorbed information mainly by \"doing nothing, observing, having conversations, exploring, and through self-directed learning\". They liken the \"chaotic nature\" of informal learning to the process that leads to scientific breakthroughs, the early stages of crafting a novel, coming up with a solution to a technical problem, or the act of composing music.</p> <p>\"Its products are often intangible, its processes obscure, its progress piecemeal,\" they say. \"There are false starts, unrelated bits and pieces picked up, interests followed and discarded, sometimes to be taken up again, sometimes not... Yet the chaotic nature of the informal curriculum does not appear to be a barrier to children organising it into a coherent body of knowledge.\"</p> <p>Thomas and Pattison acknowledge that critics will say home-educated children are likely to pick up information peppered with misunderstandings or inaccuracies, and parents may unwittingly pass on their own misconceptions. \"Yet the lack of information quality-control does not appear to lead to muddled, confused children,\" they say.</p> <p>\"In some ways, it may be an advantage because, rather than presenting knowledge in neat packages, the informal curriculum forces learners to become actively engaged with their information - to work with it, move it around, juggle ideas and resolve contradictions... It is not a static thing contained in a series of educational folders. It is alive and dynamic.\"</p> <p><strong>Hurly-burly</strong></p> <p>This comes across in their interviews with families, who say learning occurs in the \"simple hurly-burly of everyday life\". One mother said: \"I provide materials, resources, help with research, discuss what they are reading and what I am reading, watch documentaries with them, have stimulating conversations, listen a lot and answer questions.\"</p> <p>Most teachers and parents would balk at one parent's remarks that all her son did until he was 12 was \"watch Star Wars and play on the trampoline\" and that he \"didn't even know when his birthday was\". Another said: \"Sometimes days go by without anything special happening.\"</p> <p>But Thomas and Pattison marvel at the way one girl learned maths by \"helping with the cooking and shopping, and collecting supermarket-trolley money\". </p> <p>\"She came to appreciate the value of material goods, but she did not see it like that,\" they say. \"She saw only the concrete activity. If she did sometimes count money or do sums in her head, it was her decision, sparked by her emerging understanding, or simple curiosity about numbers.</p> <p>\"The point is that maths, certainly most of what is acquired at the primary level, can be learned as an integral part of everyday concrete activities. In school, maths has to be divorced from the dynamic realities of everyday life.\"</p> <p>Home education is just an extension of good parenting, Thomas and Pattison argue. \"School itself necessarily curtails such parental contribution.\" Why, they ask, do we as a society assume that formal learning needs to take over beyond the age of five? \"There is no developmental or educational logic behind the radical change in pedagogy from informal to formal when children start school,\" they say.</p> <p>Contrary to expectations, the home-educated children had no difficulty entering formal education, the authors found. The informal curriculum is \"as good a preparation as any\" for college, university or academic correspondence courses, they say. \"The young people had the personal skills to make the transition with apparent ease.\"</p> <p><strong>Caution urged</strong></p> <p>Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, urges caution. Informal learning is an adjunct, not a replacement for a formal curriculum, he warns. There's a case for starting formal education later in this country, he acknowledges, but the curriculum is still essential. </p> <p>\"Living our lives is a deeply mysterious business,\" he says. \"The curriculum opens up a number of ways we can understand it: history, science, art, maths. It's very important that we give all young people the opportunity to engage with all subjects, whether they immediately occur to them or their parents or not. Schools have developed ways of condensing canons of literature, for example, and introducing it in sequence to children.\" </p> <p>And not all learning is pleasurable; some of it is painful and repetitive. Unless children are in a social situation that makes them stay at it, they will lose out. \"It's very important that parents have the option to home-educate their children, but I wouldn't advise it,\" he says.</p> <p>Anyway, if home education is that good, why is Ian Fisher hoping to go to college to do A-levels? The only reason, he says, is that he needs qualifications to have a career and that, at his age, the only way to be taught by experts, is to go to college. </p> <p>That will always be the conundrum for home education.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How Children Learn at Home by Alan Thomas and Harriet Pattison is published by Continuum at \u00a316.99</p>",
  "<p>As the 21st century arrived, two distinguished psychiatrists offered mankind proof, written proof - in a study called A Preliminary Survey of Rhinotillexomania in an Adolescent Sample - that most teenagers pick their noses.</p> <p>Dr Chittaranjan Andrade and Dr BS Srihari, colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India, were inspired by an earlier published report by scientists in the American state of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin research claimed that more than 90% of adults are active nose-pickers. But it was silent as to whether teenagers are less or more picky than their elders.</p> <p>Andrade and Srihari decided to find out. They had a serious purpose. Virtually any human activity, if carried to excess, can be considered a psychiatric disorder. Nose-picking is no exception. \"While nose-picking behaviour in general appears to be a common and normal habit,\" they wrote, \"it is necessary to determine the extent to which rhinotillexomania amounting to a disorder exists in the adolescent population.\"</p> <p>They prepared themselves by reading other medical reports about nose-picking. With few exceptions, those reports dealt with spectacular individual nose-pickers, most of whom were psychotic. Andrade and Srihari learned that nose-picking, as practised by disturbed individuals, can be chronic, violent and associated with nosebleeds. The two psychiatrists studied Gigliotti and Waring's 1968 report, Self-Inflicted Destruction of Nose and Palate: Report of Case. They scoured Akhtar and Hastings's 1978 report, Life-Threatening Self-Mutilation of the Nose. They marvelled at Tarachow's 1966 report, Coprophagia and Allied Phenomena, noting from it that \"persons do eat nasal debris, and find it tasty, too\".</p> <p>Those cases all had their points of interest, but they could serve only as background material for the work Andrade and Srihari had in mind. To determine the nose-picking who, what, where, when, why and how of a community, one must statistically sample the picking practices of many individuals.</p> <p>Sampling is what the Wisconsin researchers did with adults. Sampling is what Andrade and Srihari knew they must do with adolescents.</p> <p>Their meticulous survey of 200 students revealed that:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nose-picking practices are the same for all social classes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Less than 4% of the students claimed they never pick their noses. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Half of the students pick their noses four or more times a day. About 7% say they indulge 20 or more times a day.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 80% use their fingers exclusively. The rest are split almost evenly in their use of tools, some choosing tweezers while others prefer pencils.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> More than half said they do it to unclog nasal passages or relieve discomfort or itching. About 11% claimed they do it for cosmetic reasons, and a similar number do it just for pleasure.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 4.5% said they ate the nasal debris.</p> <p>Those are just a few highlights.</p> <p>Andrade and Srihari were awarded the 2001 Ig Nobel prize in the field of public health. At the ceremony, Andrade explained: \"Some people poke their nose into other people's business. I made it my business to poke my business into other people's noses.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize</p>",
  "<p>Bill Colleran, who has died at the age of 78, was a towering figure, both in the world of music publishing, and literally: his tall, elegant presence was an unmissable element of the London concert scene over five decades. His career in publishing began in the 1950s, when he joined the old-established firm of Banks Music in York. In 1958 he moved to the London office of the Vienna-based music publisher Universal Edition (UE), which had been founded in 1901 and was to become the pre-eminent publisher of 20th-century music, signing Mahler, Bartok, Schoenberg and Jan\u00e1cek among many others.</p> <p>Bill remained with UE until 1994. His first role there was to develop the educational catalogue and, together with John Paynter, he concentrated on introducing music by living composers into the educational system. This they developed further with the New Music in Action summer school at the University of York, which flourished until the late 1970s.</p> <p>Bill's flair for working with composers quickly led him to be offered responsibility within UE for promoting their contemporary music catalogue, and among the first composers he brought in was Harrison Birtwistle. Many other major names followed, including Morton Feldman, Bernard Rands, Cornelius Cardew, Nigel Osborne, Steve Reich, David Bedford, Dominic Muldowney, Simon Holt, James MacMillan and David Sawer.</p> <p>His taste was for the avant-garde, but this did not mean that he was deaf to composers whose outlook was more conventional. His loyalty to and affection for them all was generously returned in the many works that were dedicated to him throughout his career. Of these he was especially proud of Feldman's Coptic Light, and the composer's early death in 1987 hit him hard.</p> <p>As a publisher, he took a delight in the physical appearance of music, and the commemorative edition of scores for the 50th anniversary of UE London that he supervised in 1986 was recognised by the Royal Society of Arts' Radcliffe award for excellence in graphics and music publishing. Other recognition came late in life - the 2002 Leslie Boosey award of the Performing Right and Royal Philharmonic Societies honoured his contribution to contemporary music while, earlier this year, the University of York appointed him honorary fellow of the department of music.</p> <p>Much of his time at UE was spent travelling and promoting the catalogue worldwide, and as well as consolidating the London base, he was instrumental in setting up UE Australia and UE Canada. But his achievements were to be undermined by internal problems in Vienna, and when it became clear in the late 1980s that the contracts of many of his composers were not to be renewed, Bill was understandably bitter.</p> <p>It was not easy for him to advise those who remained to stay with UE, and it was probably inevitable that most would leave, including Birtwistle, who signed a new contract with Boosey &amp; Hawkes. Although he stayed on until statutory retirement age, Bill's heart was no longer in the job, and he became severely depressed.</p> <p>In 1992 I invited him to join the board of the recording company NMC; with a new focus on living composers, he was a committed and stimulating chair from 1993 until 2004. In 1994 he established, together with the composer David Blake, the University of York Music Press, which became a haven not only for some of the composers he had had to abandon but to many more, both young and established. </p> <p>Born in Epsom to a German-Jewish mother, Bill was brought up first by his stepfather's cousin in Ireland, and then by his maternal grandmother in Surrey. His childhood was difficult, and his education was interrupted by frequent bouts of tuberculosis, necessitating long periods in sanatoriums. As a result, he never completed his law degree at Cambridge.</p> <p>He was a remarkable mixture of the urbane, fastidious and down to earth, with a cutting sense of humour. His droll and seemingly offhand manner concealed a fierce intelligence and a firmness of purpose which he would not often reveal. He was a very private man: his many friends - especially women friends - might get to know a part of him, but rarely the whole. A composer close to him described Bill as essentially mysterious - it was almost as if he had invented himself, so little did his early years relate to his working life.</p> <p>Illness dogged his last years, but he remained as active as he could be, and he was determined not to miss the performance of Birtwistle's The Minotaur at The Royal Opera House in April. His late marriage to Elizabeth brought him great happiness: the long years he had spent in the sanatorium, had been, he said, the only untroubled part of his life until he met her.</p> <p>He is survived by Elizabeth, by his first wife, Pat, and second wife, Kate, and by Marcus, the son of his first marriage.</p> <p><strong>Nigel Osborne writes:</strong> Bill was a man of many parts. My guess is that the County Mayo boy became the perfect English gentleman in the academy of hard knocks and survival. He was the jet-setting promoter of the 20th century's iconic catalogue, but also the hard-working music rep: Pennies from Heaven-style, suitcase of samples, B&amp;Bs and a shilling in the gas meter. He had an immaculate sensibility for contemporary art as well as a streetwise wit, and the fastest repartee in town. In later years, the no-nonsense patrician gaze over half-moons would readily melt into the mischievous grin of a dedicated anarchist and forgiver of all human weakness.</p> <p>Bill was more than a publisher. His inspiration and enthusiasm reached to the quick of the music itself. He had an animal instinct for value in new work and a commitment to modernism tempered, like Toledo steel, in the blood of assassins. He gave his composers tough love: unconditional in support, frank in criticism. The world of contemporary art is much darker without his illumination.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>William Martin Colleran, music publisher, born November 25 1929; died July 6 2008</p>",
  "<p>Sweets were distributed, guns were fired into the air and some people broke out in dance in cities across Pakistan in response to the news that President Pervez Musharraf had resigned yesterday. </p> <p>Yet the rejoicing was patchy in a nation where ordinary people have been so hard hit by recent price rises in food that many are struggling to feed themselves.</p> <p>In Islamabad's Aabpara market, people in shops, stalls and tea houses were glued to television screens to watch the president's address. Pick-up trucks playing music and carrying party activists waving the flags of the political parties now in government, drove around streets choked with traffic.</p> <p>\"They should hang [Musharraf] upside down for what he has done to the poor of this country,\" said Ali Alam, a waiter. \"We are taken to court if we do something wrong. Why not him? God willing, things will change for the better now.\" </p> <p>There was some hope that democracy can finally start to work in Pakistan, though such optimism was in the minority. \"These generals have no role in politics. Their job is to defend the country,\" said , a shopper, Mohammad Hanif. \"They must leave these things to the politicians.\" </p> <p>A shop keeper, Zahid Hussain, said that the government now had no excuses and must deliver. \"The government says that it can't do its job because of his interference. Now we'll see if that is true. We'll see who's stopping who,\" said Hussain. \"And we'll see if the judges [fired by Musharraf in November] are restored.\" </p> <p>Angering the market traders in Aabpara was the memory of the military operation ordered last year by Musharraf against Islamabad's radical Red Mosque, which had been taken over by armed extremists. They said that this one grisly episode would be what he would be most remembered for, insisting that thousands died in the raid, not the official figure of 100.</p> <p>\"The Red Mosque is the biggest issue,\" said Kurram Aklaq, who runs a cloth shop, said: \"That's where [Musharraf] killed 3,000, maybe 4,000 Islamic students. The way they were butchered is unforgiveable. And what did they find in there? Nothing. It was just done to show America that Pakistan acts against terrorists, to keep the aid money flowing.\" </p> <p>Musharraf's role in the \"war on terror\" remains highly controversial. \"This 9/11 happened in America. Why are we fighting their war? Before Musharraf there was no al-Qaida here and our borders were secure,\" said Amir Naqvi, drinking tea in a cafe. \"Now we have the US on one side [in Afghanistan] and India on the other.\" </p> <p>But it is the issue of inflation, blamed squarely on Musharraf, that incensed ordinary people on the streets. \"People are selling their children. They should jail Musharraf for that,\" said Abid Cheema. \"The only thing cheap in Pakistan now is death.\" </p> <p>Sky-rocketing prices of basic foodstuffs, such as flour, sugar and cooking oil, have left Pakistanis hungry. It is widely believed that government can, and must, control prices. </p> <p>Compounding the misery is a severe shortage of electricity, which means that power is cut off from homes and businesses for several hours every day, another grievance blamed on the president. </p> <p>While most were glad to see the end of Musharraf's time in power, there was huge cynicism about what will follow. \"They're all American puppets, all our rulers,\" said Mohammed Attique, an engineer. \"And they are greedy, corrupt. There has been no change for 60 years, so why should we expect it now?\" </p> <p>Tariq Abdullah, a stallholder, said: \"There's no shortage of resources in this country but we go forward a bit and then reverse. We never progress.\"</p>",
  "<p>Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the first lady of France and scion of Europe's urban elite, has risked the wrath of shepherds, trekkers and farmers by supporting the reintroduction of brown bears to the Pyrenees.</p> <p>In a letter addressed to several environmental groups, the wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy rejected the idea that the animals had disrupted the rural calm of the mountains and put local residents at risk since their arrival in 2006. Although difficult, she said, it was possible for people to live peacefully with their ursine neighbours.</p> <p>\"There should be no question, in our country, of choosing between bear and man,\" said the supermodel-turned-singer. \"We must find a balanced means of coexistence. On the one hand, the presence of bears in the Pyrenees reflects a willingness to protect biodiversity ... on the other, the support of the local population is essential.\"</p> <p>Bruni-Sarkozy's letter was greeted with delight yesterday by those in favour of the bears. But it will do nothing to increase her popularity among those in rural areas who are against them - and who claim her urban background disqualifies her from passing judgment. </p> <p>The arrival in the mountains two years ago of five Slovenian bears sparked fury among shepherds, who claimed the animals threatened their livestock. It also worried the tourism industry, which said visitors would be put off the region. </p> <p>Opponents of the release mounted a sustained- and occasionally violent - campaign, blocking roads, leading demonstrations and even planting honey pots laced with glass shards in the countryside. But their protests were largely in vain; there are now about 20 bears roaming the Pyrenees region.</p> <p>News of Bruni-Sarkozy's letter came days after a minibus carrying disabled children was attacked by a bear in the south-western Ari\u00e8ge region. The incident, in which no one was harmed, prompted opponents of reintroduction to call again for the bears' removal. \"The animals have been transported to a territory they are not used to,\" said a local critic. \"They should have been left at home.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani</strong><br>Army chief</p> <p>Perceived as a close Musharraf ally when appointed last year, but pulled the army back from politics. Expected to be courted by the US for its war on terror in the lawless border regions and by Pakistani politicians to ensure the army does not stage another coup.</p> <p><strong>Nawaz Sharif</strong><br>Leader, Pakistan Muslim League-N</p> <p>Leads Pakistan's second-largest party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, served as finance minister and chief minister under General Zia-ul-Haq during martial law.

He and Sharif plotted to impeach Musharraf. Zardari was known as \"Mr 10%\" in Bhutto's first term as prime minister, because of bribery allegations, later as \"Mr 20%\".</p> <p><strong>Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry</strong><br>Chief justice</p> <p>Described by Musharraf as \"the scum of the Earth\" when the president tried to sack him in March last year. Chaudhry repeatedly opposed Musharraf. The supreme court rejected the deportation of Sharif. The chief justice also took up cases of \"forced disappearances\".</p>",
  "<p>Over half an hour into President Musharraf's address to the nation I texted a friend to say: \"This is a resignation speech, right?\" She wrote back: \"I don't see what else it could be.\" Neither could I, but to the last Musharraf had the air of a man so strongly convinced that he was indispensable to Pakistan that it was hard to believe the former commando would resist one final assault on his political rivals. When it came to it, though, the assault was merely rhetorical - the man of action with nothing left but words to fall back on.</p> <p>His exit seemed inevitable from the moment his king's party - the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q) - was routed in the February elections; but Pakistan's leaders have a way of turning the inevitable into the suspenseful. Over the weekend Islamabad was rife with rumours - including the one that said he was still waiting for Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif, the leaders of the two largest democratic parties and the country's most uneasy bedfellows, to tear each other to pieces and allow him to step in and clean up the mess. Other pundits weighed in to say the army wouldn't allow its former head to be humiliated, and Sharif - who was deposed in 1999 by Musharraf - would settle for nothing less. </p> <p>But in the end it was in no one's interests to stand up for a man who wreaked incalculable damage on the nation in his refusal to accept challenges to his authority - challenges that arose last year from the judiciary, and were taken up by the press. In his nine years as president, Musharraf tangoed and tangled with a number of individuals and institutions, but it is his relationship with the press that is most revealing. To start with, he missed few opportunities to extol the virtues of a free press and did more than any leader in Pakistan's history to make that free press available with his decision to open up the airwaves and allow a mushrooming of cable channels. </p> <p>It is a tragedy of Musharraf's time in office that he came to see this, his one great legacy, as Frankenstein's monster; before long he was darkly commenting that to speak against him was to speak against the nation, and he imposed draconian curbs on the media when he declared a state of emergency last November - in an act of utter desperation. However, no degree of censorship could obliterate the writing on the wall - clear for everyone except Musharraf to see. </p> <p>But although he has finally bowed out - there remained no other option once both the army and the US refused to back his bid to stay in power - Pakistan is not really in any condition to be euphoric. Suicide bombings are rampant, the Taliban have control over parts of the country, and the economy is in free fall. To add to this, Zardari and Sharif have given the nation ample reason in the past to deeply mistrust their governance. </p> <p>In fact, so great is their unpopularity that there exists a vociferous segment of Pakistani society that continues to believe that Musharraf was the better option - \"This is Pakistan, not Oz,\" a friend angrily wrote to me when I voiced approval of Musharraf's departure. She meant that in a fairytale world democracy might be an ideal solution, but the corruption and infighting of Pakistan's democratic leaders still made Musharraf the better choice. But for me her comment merely conjured up an image of Musharraf as the man behind the curtain. And claims of the army's lack of corruption need to be considered in the context of the staggering degree of economic wealth and influence the top brass has garnered for itself - legally, but not ethically - as discussed in Ayesha Siddiqa's revealing book Military Inc, published last year.</p> <p>But even among the strongest supporters of democracy there is anxiety about what tomorrow brings. The removal of Musharraf means Sharif and Zardari no longer have common cause, and the jostling for power between them is likely to get very ugly, just when the country most needs them to put aside personal enmities and deal with the problems at hand. The more frightening truth is that those problems - in terms of both security and the economy - have snowballed so far that there are no quick fixes. </p> <p>Musharraf's final machiavellian act in his resignation speech was to paint a picture of his presidency as a period of prosperity, moderation and good governance - set against the dismal state of the nation today, which reflects the abuses of six months of civilian rule. Right now, only the truly deluded would accept that version of events, but the fragility of Pakistan's democracy makes the months ahead particularly perilous. If things get worse, as they may well do, it will be easy to blame democracy itself. It's worth bearing in mind a comment made at the South Bank Centre by the Booker-longlisted Mohammed Hanif: \"I think we Pakistanis need to be a little more patient with our democrats, and a little less patient with our dictators.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kamila Shamsie is the author of Broken Verses <br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It's a novel way to take your own life. Just as Russia demonstrates what happens to former minions that annoy it, Poland agrees to host a US missile defence base. The Russians, as Poland expected, respond to this proposal by offering to turn the country into a parking lot. This proves that the missile defence system is necessary after all: it will stop the missiles Russia will now aim at Poland, the Czech Republic and the UK in response to, er, their involvement in the missile defence system.</p> <p>The American government insists that the interceptors, which will be stationed on the Baltic coast, have nothing to do with Russia: their purpose is to defend Europe and the US against the intercontinental ballistic missiles Iran and North Korea don't possess. This is why they are being placed in Poland, which, as every geography student in Texas knows, shares a border with both rogue states.</p> <p>They permit us to look forward to a glowing future, in which missile defence, according to the Pentagon, will \"protect our homeland ... and our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack\"; as long as the Russians wait until it's working before they nuke us. The good news is that, at the present rate of progress, reliable missile defence is only 50 years away. The bad news is that it has been 50 years away for the past six decades.</p> <p>The system has been in development since 1946, and so far it has achieved a grand total of nothing. You wouldn't know it if you read the press releases published by the Pentagon's missile defence agency: the word \"success\" features more often than any other noun. It is true that the programme has managed to hit two out of the five missiles fired over the past five years during tests of its main component, the ground-based midcourse missile defence (GMD) system. But, sadly, these tests bear no relation to anything resembling a real nuclear strike.</p> <p>All the trials run so far - successful or otherwise - have been rigged. The target, its type, trajectory and destination, are known before the test begins. Only one enemy missile is used, as the system doesn't have a hope in hell of knocking down two or more. If decoy missiles are deployed, they bear no resemblance to the target and they are identified as decoys in advance. In order to try to enhance the appearance of success, recent flight tests have become even less realistic: the agency has now stopped using decoys altogether when testing its GMD system.</p> <p>This points to one of the intractable weaknesses of missile defence: it is hard to see how the interceptors could ever outwit enemy attempts to confuse them. As Philip Coyle - formerly a senior official at the Pentagon with responsibility for missile defence - points out, there are endless means by which another state could fool the system. For every real missile it launched, it could dispatch a host of dummies with the same radar and infra-red signatures. Even balloons or bits of metal foil would render anything resembling the current system inoperable. You can reduce a missile's susceptibility to laser penetration by 90% by painting it white. This sophisticated avoidance technology, available from your local hardware shop, makes another multibillion component of the programme obsolete. Or you could simply forget about ballistic missiles and attack using cruise missiles, against which the system is useless.</p> <p>Missile defence is so expensive and the measures required to evade it so cheap that if the US government were serious about making the system work it would bankrupt the country, just as the arms race helped to bring the Soviet Union down. By spending a couple of billion dollars on decoy technologies, Russia would commit the US to trillions of dollars of countermeasures. The cost ratios are such that even Iran could outspend the US. </p> <p>The US has spent between $120bn and $150bn on the programme since Ronald Reagan relaunched it in 1983. Under George Bush, the costs have accelerated. The Pentagon has requested $62bn for the next five-year tranche, which means that the total cost between 2003 and 2013 will be $110bn. Yet there are no clear criteria for success. As a recent paper in the journal Defense and Security Analysis shows, the Pentagon invented a new funding system in order to allow the missile defence programme to evade the government's usual accounting standards. It's called spiral development, which is quite appropriate, because it ensures that the costs spiral out of control.</p> <p>Spiral development means, in the words of a Pentagon directive, that \"the end-state requirements are not known at programme initiation\". Instead, the system is allowed to develop in whatever way officials think fit. The result is that no one has the faintest idea what the programme is supposed to achieve, or whether it has achieved it. There are no fixed dates, no fixed costs for any component of the programme, no penalties for slippage or failure, no standards of any kind against which the system can be judged. And this monstrous scheme is still incapable of achieving what a few hundred dollars' worth of diplomacy could do in an afternoon.</p> <p>So why commit endless billions to a programme that is bound to fail? I'll give you a clue: the answer is in the question. It persists because it doesn't work.</p> <p>US politics, because of the failure by both Republicans and Democrats to deal with the problems of campaign finance, is rotten from head to toe. But under Bush, the corruption has acquired Nigerian qualities. Federal government is a vast corporate welfare programme, rewarding the industries that give millions of dollars in political donations with contracts worth billions. Missile defence is the biggest pork barrel of all, the magic pudding that won't run out, however much you eat. The funds channelled to defence, aerospace and other manufacturing and service companies will never run dry because the system will never work.</p> <p>To keep the pudding flowing, the administration must exaggerate the threats from nations that have no means of nuking it - and ignore the likely responses of those that do. Russia is not without its own corrupting influences. You could see the grim delight of the Russian generals and defence officials last week, who have found in this new deployment an excuse to enhance their power and demand bigger budgets. Poor old Poland, like the Czech Republic and the UK, gets strongarmed into becoming America's groundbait. </p> <p>If we seek to understand American foreign policy in terms of a rational engagement with international problems, or even as an effective means of projecting power, we are looking in the wrong place. The government's interests have always been provincial. It seeks to appease lobbyists, shift public opinion at crucial stages of the political cycle, accommodate crazy Christian fantasies and pander to television companies run by eccentric billionaires. The US does not really have a foreign policy. It has a series of domestic policies which it projects beyond its borders. That they threaten the world with 57 varieties of destruction is of no concern to the current administration. The only question of interest is who gets paid and what the political kickbacks will be.</p> <p><a href=\"http://monbiot.com\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>There are more domestic arguments in the kitchen than in the bedroom, researchers have found. Spot on, and that's because there's usually only one person to argue with in the bedroom, but the whole world can come poking its nose into the kitchen. I've had the partner, mother, daughter, builder, surveyor, neighbours, lodgers and the odd passing plumber, and they each knew what was wrong with my kitchen, its structure and inadequacies, my behaviour in it and my standards of hygiene. Often they would gang up and criticise in pairs: daughter and mother against partner, or me; mother and visiting ally against daughter, or partner, until the kitchen was a boiling cauldron of loathing.</p> <p>To me, the kitchen has always been the epicentre of turmoil and relationship breakdown. I was once cooking away happily when in came the partner. He threw an ingredient of his own choosing, without consultation, into my pot. How dare he? What chutzpah. Another time, my mother was preparing to cook when a fly entered the kitchen. Cue panic and wild flapping of the dishcloth. That fly had just been outside standing on dog shit, she knew it for certain. Next it would stand on something in our kitchen. We must all swim in Dettol or die. Her view, for once, was shared by the partner. Not one more fly would enter the kitchen; he would see to it. Through the boiling heat of the hottest summer for half a century, all kitchen doors and windows would be kept shut. Imagine the suffocating tension. I flung the door and windows open, he flung them shut. That was the beginning of the end. The nail in the coffin of our relationship.</p> <p>But for a while there were still four of us in that kitchen, each with our own little ways. The battle for control often raged. Daughter wanted to cook lasagne, mother wanted to cook meatballs and the partner wanted to cook bolognese sauce, all from the same bit of mince. Who would get to it first? He did. Waves of hatred flooded the kitchen. Barely hidden jealousies erupted. What mad ingredients he put in. Milk! Milk with meat in a Jewish household. What a maniac. He was begging for trouble, and he got it. And that was just our normal, daily carry-on. We were living wrecks. It was heaven to reach the bedroom, where nothing at all ever happened, except exhausted sleep.</p> <p>There was another problem that bothered anyone else who found themselves in my kitchen - my low standards of hygiene: the mouldering wet sponge in the sink, the touching of dogs and then food with no handwashing in between, the odd dog hair stuck to the butter. They all lived in terror of sickness and death. A waste of energy: not one single person was ever poisoned in that kitchen. </p> <p>But it wasn't just the germs, filth and the battle for supremacy that distressed everyone. It was the kitchen design and structure itself. One lodger was desperate for a breakfast bar. I preferred space and a clear view of the garden, but the lodger nagged and nagged. He would build it himself, for free. The bar was vital, we needed more surfaces. So he built it, then he left. </p> <p>A new kitchen was planned. Not by me, what did I know about kitchens? Partner knew best. This was in the early days, when I still believed in him. It had acres of surface, but still we all suffered in it. </p> <p>At last I moved to my own flat, with its own kitchen. No bossy bastard could say another word about it. But along came the surveyor. \"You have paid too much for this flat,\" said he. \"At this price, it should have a top-of-the-range kitchen, and it hasn't.\" Exactly. Which is why I bought it. It has barely any stinking kitchen to speak of; minimal surfaces, just a stand up cooker with eye-level grill and a sink. And the piano, and a clear view of the garden. It doesn't even look like a kitchen. Hopefully, no one else will ever want to use it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>I've just had cataract operation number two. Fabulous. I can see long-distance with my two new eyeballs. But now I can't read, except with reading glasses, briefly, because of the glaring white pages and blinding computer screen in this sparkly new world without cataracts. So I've kept the sunglasses on, enlarged my typeface to giant size, but what's going on in the news? Haven't a clue. Can't read my watch, can't read texts, can't read the paper. Can't walk the dogs in case they jerk my eyeballs. I must be fearfully careful. </p> <p>Then I go to hang out the washing and the line pings, spraying grit under my sunglasses and into my bloody eye. How is that possible? Just my luck. But I plod on bravely. Daughter, Clayden and Rosemary come round in relays to read the papers for me out loud. What saints. And Rosemary must learn to text for me. I sit in the shadows shouting instructions. \"Press the red phone sign. Press the three dots under Options.\" I know it, rather cleverly, by heart, but Rosemary has big fingers and a bad temper. The blind leading the lame. What a struggle life is. But only temporarily, I hope.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Michele saw <strong>the death of Wellard</strong> the dog on <strong>EastEnders</strong>, just about: \"But I had to leave the room in case I cried and wrecked my new eyeballs.\" She also <strong>saw the whole of London clearly</strong>, for miles and miles, from the <strong>top of Westminster cathedral</strong>: \"Which has been fabulously renovated by two Jewish developers.\"</p>",
  "<p>'It is a trite observation that environmental problems, although they closely affect municipal laws, are essentially international; and that the main structure of control can therefore be no other than that of international law.\" Thus wrote Robert Jennings QC, a former president of the international court of justice, in his foreword to the first edition of Philippe Sands's Principles of International Environmental Law, published in 1995 - years before the potential effects of climate change had transformed public perceptions. Yet even today, after all the millions of words that have been written on the subject of climate change, we seem no closer to establishing that \"structure of control\". Indeed, Jennings's observation that the problem is mainly to be solved by legal means might now seem not so much trite as unorthodox, bold or even eccentric.</p> <p>The potential effects of climate change and the urgency of efforts to tackle it have been given a new focus by recent developments, including reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Nicholas Stern on behalf of the UK government. Although few deny the necessity of finding solutions, even fewer have any to hand. International summit statements only confirm the diplomatic efforts involved in attaining any kind of consensus.</p> <p>The understandable reluctance of developing countries to sign up to carbon commitments - unless the developed world is prepared to make an equitable contribution - calls for more radical options. Those options must be realised at state, regional and international levels, and they will require political, economic and legal solutions.</p> <p>In this mix, international legal instruments are crucial. The existing tools lack the necessary jurisdiction, clout and transparency. The time is ripe for a serious consideration of an international court for the environment. Such a court was mooted in Washington in 1999, but sank without trace. Today, however, we cannot afford to drop the ball.</p> <p>Ideally, such a court would be compulsory and would include a convention on the right to a healthy environment and deliver transparency in access to data and in its proceedings. It would include a scientific body to assess technical issues and a mechanism to avoid \"forum shopping\" - that is, litigants taking their pick of the most propitious court available.</p> <p>Of course, regulations and sanctions alone cannot deliver a global solution to problems of climate change, but without such components the incentive for individual countries to address those problems - and to achieve solutions that are politically acceptable within their own jurisdictions - will be much reduced.</p> <p>As far as the business community is concerned, an international court for the environment would offer a centralised system accessible to a range of actors, an enhanced body of law regarding environmental issues, and consistency in judicial resolution of environmental disputes. Such a court would also bring an increased focus on preventative measures, a set of global standards of care, and the facilitation and enforcement of environmental treaties. In addition, it could persuade the world business community to develop risk-management systems and improve present practices, thereby reducing the likelihood of environmental catastrophe.</p> <p>Only an impartial adjudicating body is capable of providing the catalyst for a global consensus as to the fairest way to distribute the burdens that accompany solutions to the climate change problem. Whatever difficulties may lie in the path of such solutions, the benefits will be greater.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stephen Hockman QC is a former chairman of the Bar Council; a symposium on an international court of the environment is to be held in London in November <br><a href=\"http://www.clientearth.org \">clientearth.org </a><br><a href=\"mailto:stephenhockmanqc@6pumpcourt.co.uk\">stephenhockmanqc@6pumpcourt.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In the end, Pervez Musharraf did the wise thing by quitting office peacefully. He submitted his resignation as president of Pakistan to the speaker of the national assembly, and left office saluted by an honour guard. This is a first in the history of a country where military rulers have struggled to achieve the legitimacy they crave. If he had followed his instincts by fighting impeachment charges in parliament, he would have dragged the army's name into disrepute. Even if parliament had failed to come up with the votes for an impeachment, it would not have solved the underlying crisis - a democratically elected government which could not work with its president. By resigning before charges were laid, the former commando has done himself and his country a large favour.</p> <p>Assessing the general's performance over the past nine and a half years since he seized power in a coup is not a straightforward task. He was not a military dictator in the classical sense, nor was he religious. He liberalised the media, and in so doing, created a rod for his own back. He attempted to improve the status of women by pushing for the amendment of Islamic laws. Perhaps his greatest achievement was to shift his country's thinking on India, when it went against the grain of the Pakistan military establishment.</p> <p>But his main project, the construction of a modern enlightened state, was doomed to failure. Not only because he tried to do so on the back of a feudal, patronage-driven political machine. The general's rule failed because he disdained democratic norms, like functioning political parties, the constitution and free elections. The rot set in after 2002 when he ordered a referendum on his legitimacy as president, in which no opposition candidates were permitted to stand. He packed parliament with his supporters and had no qualms about courting conservative religious parties in the troubled North-West Frontier Province. His nemesis came in the shape of the chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, who was about to hear legal challenges to the president's re-election. Mr Musharraf can date his downfall very precisely to the day, on March 9 last year, when he tried to sack Mr Chaudhry, triggering a nationwide protest and, ultimately, a state of emergency. It turned him from a struggling leader into an unpopular dictator and support has haemorrhaged ever since. Not even the head of the army turned up to the president's celebration of independence day last week, a clear sign that his days in power were numbered. </p> <p>The coalition that unseated him is unlikely to last long. Its other main task is to amend the constitution, stripping the presidency of its two main powers - the ability to sack the government and appoint the head of the army - and restoring the powers of the prime minister. If it does that, it will fall apart and fresh elections will be held. This should not, of itself, be a cause for alarm. Political pluralism is not the only source of instability, and if the Pakistan People's Party and Nawaz Sharif can not be meaningful allies, at least they can learn to be responsible adversaries. Pakistan managed a first yesterday by getting rid of a military ruler peacefully. But executive control of the army is still a long way off. By supporting the actions of a democratically elected government (albeit belatedly and reluctantly) the west is sending the army an important message: you may not love these people, but you have to live with them.</p> <p>The departed former army chief bequeaths his civilian successors an agenda laden with crises: inflation is running rampant; poverty is growing; the Taliban challenges the army for control of the tribal areas; militants carried out 56 suicide attacks last year; peace with India could unravel. Yet for all this, there is no alternative to civilian government and a functioning constitution. Pervez Musharraf tried being a benign ruler and ended up a benighted one.</p>",
  "<h2>How does Chris Hoy find trousers to fit him when he's not cycling?</h2> <p>With great difficulty, we presume. Look at those thighs. They're incredible.

I'm sure that a tailor would be extremely shocked\". <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are Caribbean sprinters so good? </h2> <p>If the father of Usain Bolt, who smashed the 100m world record in winning gold on Sunday, is to believed, it's because of the local food speciailites. \"It is definitely the Trelawny yam,\" Wellesley Bolt said by way of explanation after his son's success. Backing him up, the women's 100m winner Shelly-Ann Fraser said of the Jamaican clean sweep: \"A lot of yam, banana and dumplings produce top three!\"</p> <p>Six of the eight starters in the men's 100m final, and the first two across the line, were from the Caribbean; all three medallists in the women's event were from Jamaica. The region's proximity to the US helps - the best athletes are spotted and offered scholarships to top colleges there, where there is excellent coaching. But it is also becoming more common for some to stay in the Caribbean, with the sport massively popular and standards of coaching and facilities growing rapidly. Some say that the Caribbean's traditionally strict upbringing instils a sense of the required discipline - Jamaican Asafa Powell, former world-record holder, is the son of two pastors, and says that his focus is down to his childhood: \"I couldn't miss one day in church and my mom and dad still call to see if I'm going to church.\" Running is big in the Caribbean; the weather is good; and sprint champions are revered. But the main reason for Jamaicans' success, according to Fitz Coleman, a technical coach on Bolt's team, is the attitude. \"We genuinely believe that we'll conquer,\" he says. \"It's a mindset. We're small and we're poor, but we believe in ourselves.\" <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>When did \"to medal\" become a verb?</h2> <p>It is tempting to say about a week ago - this ear-grating usage, as in \"Romero is the only British woman to medal in two different sports\", has disfigured the Beijing games - but, annoyingly, some dictionaries do accept \"medal\" as a verb, meaning \"to decorate or honour with a medal\" or \"to receive a medal, esp. in a sporting event\". It is, however, clearly an ugly Americanism - the earliest identified use of the word meaning to win a medal dates from 1966, in California, and the Washington Post was using it by 1979 - which needs to be stamped out. The sooner medal-obsessed Americans stop meddling with the English language the better. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Whatever happened to the British love of heroic but buffoonish failures?</h2> <p>Once we could laugh at ourselves. Eddie \"the Eagle\" Edwards became a superstar for being the world's worst ski-jumper (or, as the Italians preferred, \"ski-dropper\"). But eventually the litany of failure - in cricket, football, athletics, more or less everything, really - got to us. Steve McClaren and his brolly seem to have been the last straw. Now, we don't even send no-hopers to the games, lest the \"Team GB\" brand be tarnished.</p> <p>How dull! Eddie the Eagle soared to become a global phenomenon. He made a disc, Fly Eddie Fly, which reached the top 50 in the UK, and repeated that success in Finland with Mun Nimeni On Eetu (My name is Eetu), despite not speaking a word of Finnish. What price Bradley Wiggins enjoying chart success with a disc called Go Bradley Go, let alone becoming a disco sensation in Helsinki? Failure is always more interesting - and more entertaining - than success. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Is it unseemly to cry when you get silver?</h2> <p>There are two ways to see winning Olympic silver. You are either the amazingly accomplished second-best sprinter, shot-putter, diver, tennis player, small-bore rifle (prone position) shooter in the world, or you are a USELESS FAILURE, a HOPELESS LOSER. \"Second is nowhere,\" as the sports psychologists like to say.</p> <p>Traditionally, Americans have taken the latter attitude. They expect to win, so second is a defeat. Close but no cigar. Michael Phelps wouldn't have been allowed back into the country if he'd won eight silvers. China is taking the same hard line: when one of its competitors in the shooting last week managed only a bronze, a TV interviewer rounded on him, demanding to know where it had all gone wrong. But other, more accommodating countries - us, for instance, or Belgium - have been less embarrassed about celebrating silvers and bronzes. Well done, jolly good show, marvellous effort.</p> <p>Now, all that is changing. Katherine Grainger, the senior member of the women's quadruple scull, burst into tears after she won silver - admittedly her third in successive games. Nothing but gold would do for Grainger or the rest of the sobbing crew. </p> <p>\"I feel so empty,\" said one. This is a worrying development. What on earth would they have done if they'd come last, or not even made the final, or sank? Save the tears for a real disaster, and be thankful you didn't come 23rd, like Paula. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Do chicken nuggets make you run faster?</h2> <p>If Usain Bolt's example is anything to go by, when it comes to sporting performance, chicken nuggets are the new superfood. On the day that Bolt broke his own world record in the 100m sprint, taking the race in 9.69 seconds (having glanced around many metres before the end, clocked his lead and thumped his chest happily) chicken nuggets were his sole source of energy. \"I never had breakfast,' he said afterwards. \"I woke up around 11, I watched television, and then I had some [chicken] nuggets for lunch. I went back to my room, I slept for two hours, I went back for some more nuggets and came to the track.\"</p> <p>So can chicken nuggets make us all run faster? \"I suppose it depends what you do with them,\" says Ron Maughan, professor of sport and exercise nutrition at the University of Loughborough. \"Assuming you eat them, it's highly unlikely that they'll help.\" The problem is that while nuggets can be a reasonable source of protein, which is good, they also tend to have a reasonable amount of fat. When it comes to developing as a sprinter, Maughan suggests that you're probably better off eating lean chicken-breast sandwiches during your training periods.<br><strong> KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are we so good at sailing, rowing and cycling, but useless at track and field?</h2> <p>The Australians like to joke that we Brits are good at sitting-down sports. Unfortunately, they're right. The 3,000m steeplechase, the pole vault, weightlifting, not a hope. But give us a seat on a bike, in a boat or on a horse and we're potential world-beaters.</p> <p>Part of the reason may be our innate laziness - the weather in the UK is bad and we spend most of our time indoors watching TV or playing online Scrabble - but the real key is the number of countries that participate in each sport. In three-day eventing, at which we are traditionally strong (and where we usually manage to find a member of the royal family able to compete), there are just 75 competitors. In athletics there are 2,000. To succeed in eventing you would need a fantastic horse, probably worth \u00a3250,000 or more, and the means to transport it to Beijing; in athletics you need a strong pair of lungs. Ethiopia, Morocco and Kenya are very good at athletics, but they are absolute crap at three-day eventing.</p> <p>The key to winning medals at the Olympics is to think small. Don't target sports that everyone can be good at - athletics, boxing, football. Go for technologically complicated and expensive sports that hardly anyone can afford, such as yachting. Or, better still, sports that are both mind-blowingly dull and need expensive facilities, such as cycling and rowing. Britain should press for formula one motor racing to be included in 2012. Then let's see Jamaica find someone to rival Lewis Hamilton and his McLaren. <strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Just how weird is Rebecca Romero? </h2> <p>Anyone who watched Romero being interviewed in the velodrome at the weekend, just after she'd steamed to gold in the women's individual pursuit race, might be moved to suggest that she is very weird indeed. In a good way, of course. While other athletes spend their post-race interviews simply glorying in their success, Romero retained an almost superhuman intensity. \"If I hadn't done it today, I don't know where I would be,\" she said, before adding, in the most ominous declaration of this or any games, \"probably on the floor, dead somewhere\".</p> <p>OK then. The national women's cycling coach, Dan Hunt, has said that Romero's ability to push her body through the pain barrier is \"astonishing\", while Dave Brailsford, performance director of British Cycling, has commented that \"in terms of being able to hurt yourself ... boy, oh boy!\" And it is this awesome commitment that has enabled Romero to become the only British woman ever to compete in two different sports at an Olympic Games - at Athens in 2004 she won silver in the women's quadruple sculls. \"Winning gold was like D-day,\" Romero said after the race. \"I had to face my demons, grit my teeth, and ride the best race of my life. And I did it.\" Terrifying. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>But is Romero as weird as Michael Phelps? </h2> <p>Well, that's debatable. The athlete known by his teammates as Squid Boy, by others as Superfish, and by one of his Russian rivals as \"a normal bloke from another planet\", is not quite like anyone else on Earth - no one but Michael Fred Phelps has won 14 Olympic gold medals, including eight in the past week. Physically, he is, in some ways, not so far outside the norm - at 6ft 4in he is actually a few inches shorter than fellow American Tom Malchow, the previous world record holder in the 200m butterfly, and his 6ft 7in arm span is considerably smaller than the gargantuan 7ft 5in reach of the 1980s German swimmer, Michael Gross.</p> <p>In every other way, Phelps is remarkable to the point of weirdness. He eats 12,000 calories a day - and manages to burn them all off. He has double-jointed ankles, knees and elbows. He swims more than 100km a week, and trains every day of the week, every day of the year, including Christmas Day. His coach, Bob Bowman, has said that he sometimes has to \"physically shake\" Phelps to break his pre-race trance. As one sports writer said: \"Phelps can manipulate water like no human since Moses.\" </p> <p>He is very weird indeed. Stunningly, astonishingly, fantastically weird. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>And how normal is Rebecca Adlington?</h2> <p>If Romero and Phelps come across as somewhat bizarre, British swimmer Rebecca Adlington is almost jaw-droppingly normal. Sure, in terms of her achievements, she's outstanding. She is the first British woman ever to win two swimming gold medals, and the first British female Olympic champion in the pool since 1960. She has also sliced a significant 2.12 seconds off the 800m freestyle record, which was set way back in 1989.</p> <p>Before breaking that record though, she admits that she had to lie on the floor to avoid \"standing up and being sick, because I was more nervous than I've ever been in my life\". When told that the press had been poking fun at her Mansfield home town, she retorted that \"we've lived there all my life, we love living there, and we wouldn't ever move\", and on the subject of rewards, she's said that she won't accept any endorsements that get in the way of her swimming. </p> <p>Far from putting on an aura of steely sophistication, Adlington has admitted to being \"scared of the sea. I'm absolutely petrified. It's the unknown. I can't stand fish\". And in reflecting on the games, she commented that: \"He [Phelps] is so amazing. I'm just glad that I've done what I've done at a games with him, so I get to tell my grandchildren that I was there when Michael Phelps got his eight gold medals.\" Which may be about the most modest sentence you'll ever hear from an Olympian. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Doesn't it all make you proud to be British?</h2> <p>No, in a nutshell. Of course it's jolly nice that our sailors, rowers and cyclists are doing well, that \"Dame\" Rebecca Adlington has proved that we can swim, and that Louis Smith's bronze - our first gymnastics medal since 776BC - has given the lie to accusations that we are all lazy, obese couch potatoes who always got a note from our mothers to get out of doing gym at school.</p> <p>But all this \"Proud to be British\", \"Will the Olympics rescue Gordon?\", \"Putting the Great Back into Britain\" stuff is nonsense. To paraphrase Dr Johnson, sporting patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. Think bread and circuses, Hitler at the Berlin games in 1936, East Germany's obsession with its medal tally and willingness to go to any drug-induced lengths to boost it. If sporting achievement is really the litmus test of whether a country is any good, it's a fair bet that it's an extremely dodgy, recession-threatened, knife crime-haunted, educationally chaotic, politically neutered country. Also in my view. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>How does the medals table work?</h2> <p>Well, that all depends. Go to the official Olympic website and you'll find China top by virtue of winning 36 golds, 17 more than anyone else. Here, one gold is more valuable than any number of other colours - Tunisia, with a single gold medal but nothing else, sit happily above Belarus, who have three silvers and seven bronzes. Over on the official American Olympic website, however, the US are top because they have won a total of 65 medals of any colour, two more than China. Last month Georg Dutlik, head of the EU commission in Vienna, said that all of the European Union's medals should count as one, in which case we'd be top whatever way you look at it. The Americans think we're fifth at the moment, the Chinese reckon we're third. I like them the best. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Does anyone understand the rules in the velodrome?</h2> <p>To the uninitiated - and let's be honest, we were all uninitiated until a few days ago - the cycling is impenetrable. Cyclists in absurd headgear and body-hugging Lycra suits go round and round a wall of death in a variety of events that seem to bear no resemblance to a race. In the keirin, a man on a motorbike even takes part. No prizes, you might think, for guessing who will win. In the \"sprint\", riders seem to compete to see who can go slowest, and only with great difficulty do they manage to stay on their bikes. As for the points race, Nasa scientists are still trying to find the formula by which the medals are awarded. </p> <p>The official games website offers a rather dry explanation of each of the events, including the sinister-sounding madison, but it's a bit like describing a spiral staircase. You really have to see it. Even after reading the detailed exegesis, the points race remains elusive: how come riders who get a lap ahead, apparently the objective, are then placed at the back to ensure they do badly in the sprint that takes place every eighth lap? At least it is made clear that the curious man on the motorbike is only there for show. He drops out near the end, having demonstrated that none of the cyclists can overtake him.</p> <p>But who cares about the rules? We're winning all the medals. And the great news is that Ken Livingstone has volunteered to ride the motorbike (a low-emission one of course) in 2012. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>What do the Olympians do in the evenings?</h2> <p>You'd think that after all that exertion and pressure, athletes might find time for some more relaxed physical jerks after dark. Of the 100,000 condoms available to competitors at the start of the games, though, only a third have been used so far - a big change of pace from the Sydney games in 2000, known as the Shaglympics, during which the organisers ran out of prophylactics and had to rush to the chemist for more. There are two explanations. One, no one's getting any; two, they're doing it without protection. Let's hope the former. Still, others are finding pleasure in entirely non-physical pursuits. Rafael Nadal was recently spotted using an evening off to do his laundry. Well, those shorts won't wash themselves. <strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Where has the green line gone? </h2> <p>Coverage of the swimming featured a helpful green line that whisked its way up and down the pool at world-record pace, so everyone could see by precisely what unlikely margin it was about to be broken. But it has disappeared for the athletics, which is a bit of a shame. A BBC spokeswoman explained that the line had been added by the host broadcasters, but her technical people said swimming was \"very two-dimensional\" while athletics features an unhelpful \"bend\", so don't expect to see it again any time soon.<br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>What is Yngling and how do you pronounce it?</h2> <p>Yngling is a type of keelboat, and easily the silliest of the 23 varieties of keelboat currently accredited by the International Sailing Federation, most of which sound like cast members of the Gladiators - Tempest, Lightning, Dragon, Melges 24. OK, the last one doesn't sound like a Gladiator. Its Norwegian inventor designed it for his son in 1967 and named it Yngling, Norwegian for young man. This is its second appearance in the Olympics, where it is raced only by women - the men's keelboat is the more gladiatorial Star. A spokeswoman from the Norwegian embassy says the word \"is slightly old-fashioned now\" but confirms that it is pronounced erngling, with the initial Y sounding like a German U with an umlaut. \"It's not really a word we use a lot,\" says a colleague. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Is John Major responsible for team GB's success?</h2> <p>Some are claiming that because John Major was prime minister when the national lottery was launched, and the lottery now funds many of Britain's successful athletes, the cricket-loving trapeze-artist's son is responsible for our place in the medal table. </p> <p>Britain would almost certainly be much less successful were our best athletes not given some money, but key coaching appointments - J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler in rowing and Bill Sweetenham in swimming, for example - have been just as influential. Besides, the lottery awards funding based on how well each sport does. So if you could only do well by getting lottery money, and the only way to get lottery money was to do well, the nation's sportsmen would be sent into such a tailspin of bewildering logical conundrums that they would hardly be able to run/row/pedal/swim/sail at all.<br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Why were there so many records broken in the pool?</h2> <p>At the Water Cube last week possible answers to this conundrum were being created and destroyed again almost as regularly as world records. Several technical possibilities have been suggested - the pool is both wider - it has 10 rather than eight lanes - and deeper - by about 3ft - than average, stopping nasty, distracting waves from bouncing around the place, while the plastic lane-dividers provide an extra calming effect. However, even the pool's designer, Sydney-based John Bilmon, says most of this is nothing new and believes, somewhat self-servingly, that athletes have simply been inspired by the beauty of his building. In all, 25 world records were broken in 32 events - not bad, but when the nation's athletes are better prepared than ever before and are all focused on peaking for this one event, not a total surprise. </p> <p>And then there's the outfits ... <br><strong> SB</strong></p> <h2>Can special clothes really make you faster?</h2> <p>Behind Britain's brilliant cycling squad is a team of nerds, known as the Secret Squirrel Club, who do nothing but refine their apparel. These boffins have spent the past four years hunched in their laboratories to create a \u00a310,000 superbike, designed with assistance from arms manufacturer BAE Systems. Nothing was left to chance; at one point the squirrels spent several days in a wind tunnel testing the aerodynamic efficiency of a variety of wheel spokes. It seems to have worked out quite well. It's not just them, though - everything in Beijing is better, faster, lighter. The latest gymnastics shoes weigh just 10g, about the same as a \u00a31 coin. Athletes have shoes designed to help them round bends. In the pool, 94% of the gold-medallists and 23 of the 25 world record-breakers were wearing Speedo's new Fastskin LZR Racer skinsuit, called \"technological doping\" by a jealous bloke who wasn't allowed to wear one and didn't swim very fast. It all helps, but then Phelps also thrashed the 200m butterfly world record with his eyes blinded by leaky goggles. Some of these guys would probably be pretty fast dressed as a pantomime cow. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Do some countries not care about the Olympics?</h2> <p>Brunei doesn't seem to care much. It forgot to register its two athletes, was disqualified and is the only country not taking part. Even Tuvalu is represented, presumably in the swimming. One might think, given their abysmal showing, that all the countries of South America don't care, but they do. It's just that they're too poor to develop the facilities needed to compete with the Olympics-obsessed countries of Europe, North America and Asia. The games are being followed with interest in South America, even though the medals won thus far by countries in the region have been paltry.</p> <h2>Should we feel sorry for Paula Radcliffe?</h2> <p>The quadrennial Paula debacle has provoked mixed reactions. In the Guardian, kindly Richard Williams called her attempt to win in Beijing, despite being underprepared after a leg injury, heroic. Jeff Powell, in the Daily Mail, was less forgiving, labelling her a \"drama queen\", and complaining that the race was all about her 23rd place rather than fellow Brit Mara Yamauchi's record-equalling sixth place.</p> <p>The fans on her website had better not get hold of Powell. They can barely contain their emotion. \"If medals were given out for sheer guts, Paula would win gold,\" says one. \"I'm so proud of her. She's an inspiration. She showed the true meaning of the Olympics and should now be a contender for SPOTY.\" But should she? SPOTY here means Sports Personality of the Year, but the only prize Paula is likely to win is Silly PR-conscious Optimist of the Year. She was unfit; everyone knew that; Team GB had a reserve, Hayley Haining, who was in shape and could have run in Beijing. Paula's participation, while great theatre, was dumb sport. In my view. <br><strong>SM</strong></p> <h2>Is hyperactivity a boon if you're an Olympian?</h2> <p>It seems to be. In fact, if this games has taught us anything, it's that hyperactive kids can be high achievers. Louis Smith, for instance. The British gymnast was considered a handful at school, and channeled his energy at Huntingdon Gymnastics Club, where out-of-control boys were disciplined with 200 circles on the pommel horse. The punishment certainly paid off - at the weekend, Smith won bronze in the men's pommel horse event, becoming the first British male to win a gymnastics medal in 80 years.</p> <p>And then, of course, there's Michael Phelps, who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a kid, and briefly put on medication. His mother Debbie has said that when he was in kindergarten, \"I was told by his teacher, 'Michael can't sit still, Michael can't be quiet, Michael can't focus.' I said, 'maybe he's bored.' The teacher said, 'He's not gifted. Your son will never be able to focus on anything.'\" And to that teacher must go the gold for least accurate prediction, ever. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Who are all these commentators? </h2> <p>We're used to having the same, familiar voices providing the soundtrack for major sporting events, but this is different. Where are John Motson and Peter Alliss? Who are Garry Herbert and Matthew Syed? It seems the days of the versatile jobbing commentator are almost over - now everyone has to be a former Olympic medalist. At the diving, Leon Taylor; at the judo, Nicola Fairbrother; at the hockey, Sean Kerly; at the weightlifting ... OK, we don't have a former Olympic medallist in that so we get a jobbing commentator. On the plus side, they know a lot about their sport. On the down side, they keep going on about stroke rates and their voices go squeaky at important moments. Also, shouldn't there be a clause about not interviewing athletes while they are both a) panting and b) weeping? Putting your arm on their shoulder and telling them to \"take your time\" DOES NOT MAKE IT OK. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Do men and women have equal opportunities in the games?</h2> <p>The Olympic playing field for men and women has levelled considerably in the past few decades, with women's football being introduced in 1996, for instance, weightlifting in 2000, and wrestling in 2004. There are still some areas where women aren't allowed to compete, though; specifically, boxing in the summer games, and ski-jumping in the winter games. And the overall number of events for women is far lower - while men have 12 canoe-kayak races to compete in, for example, women have only four. In fact, the disparity is so marked, that there are only 127 gold medals available to women in Beijing, compared with 165 gold medals for men. </p> <p>Gold-winning British cyclist Nicole Cooke, spoke out about this state of affairs after winning the first of Britain's gold medals last week in the road race. \"I think the biggest thing to address,\" said Cooke, \"is the inequality of cycling medals between the sexes\"; a reference to the fact that, while men can compete in seven events in the velodrome, there are only three women's events. (And Briton Victoria Pendleton might well have won them all.)</p> <p>According to the International Cycling Union, the reason for this is \"historical\" - which presumably also explains the disparity between the number of male and female events available in sports including rowing, weightlifting and wrestling. Harriet Foxwell, of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation, hopes that in 2012 there will be \"a more equal playing field: there should be the same number of medals for women as men, all sports should be contested by both sexes, half the volunteers should be women and there should be a dramatic increase in the number of female coaches\". <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Why are we called \"Team GB\"?</h2> <p>Mainly because it is considerably easier on the tongue than \"the Great Britain Olympics Team\", according to the woman behind the brand, Marzena Bogdanowicz. \"I think I had the idea in 1996 or 1997,\" says the BOA's then director of marketing. \"I went to the games in 1996 and the logo at the time was just the lion and the rings, but we weren't strong enough as a brand to just be a lion and the rings. So coming back I wanted to find something that was less of a mouthful, and also had that team feel. We looked at the options and came up with Team GB.\" The result didn't just look good on T-shirts, it also inspires Britain's best. \"Come Sydney 2000 we had Team GB everywhere,\" Bogdanowicz says. \"When the athletes arrived, they saw that and they knew they were part of a bigger team, not just a group of athletes or swimmers. That had a positive effect on everyone.\" The statistics back her up: in the last games before she got to work we won one gold medal. So far in Beijing we have won 12. <br><strong>SB</strong></p> <h2>Where's the smog gone?</h2> <p>In the past week, the high level of concern about Beijing's air quality has proved largely unfounded. The removal of 300,000 high-polluting vehicles from the city's streets since July 1 - a measure that will last until the end of the Paralympics - has apparently made a huge difference, as have the meteorological conditions, including a series of downpours that have helped clear the smog. <br><strong>KC</strong></p> <h2>Have we peaked too soon before 2012? </h2> <p>Team GB headed to Beijing with a target of 41 gold medals, which means we have another 14 still to come. The idea was to finish eighth in the final medal table here, and fourth in four years' time, but at this rate we'll have used up our entire supply of excitement about cycling by then, while Tom Daley will be a considerably-less-cute-than-14 18. But fret not - the chances are that we will improve on this performance when the circus comes to London, if only because the entry requirements for the host nation are so relaxed that we'll have far more competitors and some of them are bound to get lucky. So put that \"I heart Yngling T-shirt\" somewhere safe - you haven't finished with it yet. <br><strong>SB </strong></p>",
  "<p>The Bird's Nest Stadium is anticipating the best track event of these Games this evening when Christine Ohuruogu takes on Sanya Richards in the 400m final and attempts to become the first British woman to strike Olympic gold at this event. It pits the world champion from Osaka last summer, who has never failed to win gold in championship finals, against the world No1, who has never won an individual championship gold.</p> <p>If the qualifying rounds are any guide, Richards has the edge in form. Ohuruogu's usual routine is quick-slow-quick but, if she adopts those tactics in this race, by the time she launches her trademark final surge, it will be too late. Richards has powered into the final with the best times of the rounds. In the heats she pushed hard from the start and in the semi-final she began more slowly but kicked on.</p> <p>For all that Ohuruogu looked strong, it is Richards' deadly power between 150 and 300 metres, where she wins so many races, that is impressive.</p> <p>In Stockholm last month one of the best fields in Europe could not cope with Richards when she ran that way. But this is not a grand prix and Richards, 23, despite being the quickest 400m runner of her generation - she has a personal best of 48.70sec compared with Ohuruogu's 49.61 - has not won an individual global title.</p> <p>Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec, who won the 400m title in Atlanta in 1992 and 1996 but failed to defend it in Sydney 2000 when she withdrew blaming the stress of the publicity surrounding her rivalry with Cathy Freeman, the Australian who succeeded her as champion, believes Ohuruogu will not be able to hold Richards tonight. </p> <p>\"I do not think Christine will beat her,\" said the Frenchwoman. \"Christine is having the same season as last year, she looked good in the last 100m [of her semi]. But Sanya is running differently each time, so you do not know how to dance with her.\"</p> <p>But Ohuruogu will be the more determined to succeed because, when she left Osaka, she did not even know if she would be in Beijing because an Olympic appeal against her drugs ban lay ahead. She won that and hopes that decision will be vindicated tonight when she aims to go one better than Ann Packer in 1964 and Lillian Board in 1968.</p> <p>To do that, though, she will have to reverse her recent losing run against Richards. Although the American failed to make the 400m team for Osaka because of the after-effects of illness, she returned to beat Ohuruogu in Zurich, Berlin and Stuttgart on the way to scooping \u00a3250,000 as a winner of the Golden League.</p> <p>In all those races she powered away from the gun. Now she is ready to increase the speed again. \"Coach [Clyde] Hart told me whatever I needed to run, don't worry about it,\" said Richards. \"I am ready and I am strong. I thought in my mind I might run 49 [in the semi] but I wasn't sure, so I was happy to see 49.90. I'm close to seeing 48.\"</p> <p>But Ohuruogu, 24, the Londoner who came back from a year's suspension for missing three drugs tests to win in Japan, is not concerned. \"The way I run, the way I train, I never look at times,\" she said. \"My coach says running 400m is not about who is the fastest, who is the strongest. It's about who has the most will to get to the line first.</p> <p>\"We were pretty much working in the dark last year, what with the ban and injury, we put on a session and the programme worked. Now we have had a lot more time, we have planned our year properly. It's an interesting thing pressure, but it's only pressure if you allow it to be.

  "<p>Darren Campbell remembers the day in 1999 when he heard that Linford Christie had tested positive for nandrolone. \"We were in Sydney, getting ready for a training run,\" Campbell said in Beijing yesterday. \"Linford said, 'Let's go for a walk.' I said, 'What?' I'd known him for 10 years and we'd never gone for a walk before. But we walked down the beach at Manly and he said to me, 'I've tested positive for nandrolone.' I'd never heard of nandrolone.\"</p> <p>Campbell had been with Christie at an indoor meeting in Dortmund when the test was taken. Then aged 38 and long retired from competition, Christie was there as his coach. \"Linford had just come along to wave to the crowd, really. But me and Jamie Baulch said to him, 'Come on, you're always telling us how you can still beat us.'\" </p> <p>So Christie ran in the 60m, just for fun, before reporting to the doping control and providing the fateful sample. The result cost him not just a meaningless two-year suspension from competition but also his place among the great and the good of British sport. While UK Sport exonerated him, the IAAF did not and the British Olympic Association refuses to grant him accredition for the Games.</p> <p>He could not be with Campbell and Katharine Merry when they won silver and bronze in Sydney in 2000 and he is persona non grata with the organisers of London 2012, most particularly with Sebastian Coe, who is his antithesis in almost every way you could imagine.</p> <p>Campbell is not alone in believing that the presence of an anabolic steroid in his coach's urine was caused by a tainted food supplement. Nowadays he runs a supplements company himself and understands the dangers. \"We know about stuff like THG now but back then Linford was probably being beaten to gold medals by athletes taking it. And when he tested positive he was already a millionaire - he had a big house and a nice car and he was a BBC pundit. Why would someone like Linford Christie take a poor man's drug?\" </p> <p>There's no doubt that Christie is bitter about his treatment - about the constant whispers that accompanied his career, about the positive test, about losing his BBC post, about his absence whenever the living symbols of British sporting success are assembled at some ceremonial function, about the demeaning kerfuffle over whether or not he should have been invited to carry Beijing's Olympic torch during its ill-fated procession through London. There is, of course, the Linford Christie Stadium, just next to Wormwood Scrubs in west London. But have you been there lately?</p> <p>Personally I'm extremely sorry that he's not at the Bird's Nest and the athletes' village this week, shepherding Christian Malcolm through the 200m and lending his imposing presence to the team effort, along with a good humour that never emerges in his dealings with the media.</p> <p>In 1993, a year after Christie became Olympic champion, I saw him in the village in Stuttgart, where he was captaining the British squad at the World Championships. The quarters were the distinctly unglamorous barracks of an abandoned US Air Force base. </p> <p>While Carl Lewis and his San Diego Track Club gang were quartered at the nearby five-star Marriott hotel, Christie cheerfully stayed with his team-mates, including the 19-year-old Campbell, who was along for the experience.</p> <p>\"Lewis had been giving it all that stuff about how Linford wasn't the real Olympic champion,\" Campbell remembered. \"On the night before the final we were all in the apartment, me and Linford and Ron Roddan, his coach, and I saw that Linford was shaking. I thought, look at this. This is Linford Christie, and he's nervous. But when he walked out into the stadium the next day, he was a different man.</p> <p>\"He'd been telling me to watch everybody and to learn from everything. And that's what he taught me. Don't show people what you're feeling. So when I cramped up after the semi-final of the 200 in Sydney, I called Christian over and said, 'Just walk slowly back with me.' I didn't want to let anyone see. The people you're competing against have got to be made to believe that you've still got that power.\"</p> <p>Just as his coach had done in 1993, Campbell went out and did his stuff. So did Merry. They are just two of the people with an understanding of the meaning of the ostracisation of Linford Christie. What a stupid waste it is.</p> <h2>London 2012 could kill two birds with one stone </h2> <p>Back in 1900, when Paris hosted the Olympics for the first time, the programme featured several events that would now be considered exotic. Sad to relate, the story about the inclusion of poodle-clipping appears to be apocryphal but the schedule certainly included pigeon shooting - with live pigeons. Somewhere between 200 and 300 of them died in the cause of sport.</p> <p>Here, perhaps, is something the London 2012 committee should be considering: an event with a genuinely local flavour. Indeed it's surprising that Ken Livingstone, a noted peristerophobe, didn't spot the opportunity to liven up the original bid document by proposing a live pigeon-shooting event - in Trafalgar Square, of course, where several years ago his more conventional efforts to exterminate the pigeon population came to naught.</p> <h2>Cherubic gymnast with a decent left hook</h2> <p>As Alicia Sacramone prepared to mount the balance beam, she looked like just another of the little suburban shopping-mall princesses who make up the US female gymnastics team. As soon as she landed, however, she toppled and fell off. That meant disaster. She remounted and ran through the rest of her routine without a flaw, but then came the extraordinary bit. Surrounded by a consoling flutter of Shawns and Nastias and Chellsies, she refused to cry. </p> <p>Her lower lip trembled and eyes welled as the camera zoomed in but she lifted her chin and held the tears at bay.</p> <p>I admired her refusal to capitulate to the imperatives of sport-as-soap-opera as much as anything I saw that day. But then I looked on YouTube and found a clip of her knocking some guy to the ground with a tidy left hook, witnessed to date by more than 750,000 people. There's more to these shopping-mall princesses than you might imagine. Particular ones who come from Boston and were discovered doing cartwheels in, yes, a shopping mall.</p> <h2>Cooke follows the cycle lanes </h2> <p>When Nicole Cooke fished her gold medal out of her backpack, it was in a smart black velvet bag. So that's what they give you to keep it in, I said. Oh, no, she replied, I brought it with me. Another example of British Cycling's meticulously detailed forward planning? No - it was the bag they give you along with a pair of sports sunglasses. </p> <p>Cooke had spent the morning on her bike, riding around Beijing taking tourist photographs before travelling to the velodrome, where she sat with the Guardian to watch the heats of the women's individual pursuit. As first Rebecca Romero and then Wendy Houvenaghel zoomed past, she asked: Don't you cheer? Well, no, I said, somewhat sheepishly, we're trained to be dispassionate. Soon afterwards she made her excuses and left.</p> <h2>Wenger's numbers just don't add up </h2> <p>It's been a relief to miss the hype accompanying the start of the football season but it proved impossible late one night to resist the temptation to open an email containing the squad numbers of Premier League teams and to wonder, not for the first time, exactly what goes on in Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's head. Abou Diaby, a midfielder who likes to score goals, with a No2 on his back? Worse, William Gallas, a central defender, still wearing the sacred No10? Does the man have no sense of history or romance?</p>",
  "<p>A British woman has been ordered to pay more than \u00a316,000 to an American computer games company after illegally sharing its files over the internet.</p> <p>The woman, who is not being named, is one of the first to be successfully targeted in the UK as part of the media industry's battle with digital pirates.</p> <p>The company, Nevada-based TopWare Interactive, claimed the woman made its game Dream Pinball 3D available to other internet users in breach of the law. After a civil hearing at the patents county court in London, a judge ruled that she should pay TopWare more than \u00a36,000 in damages and \u00a310,000 in costs.</p> <p>The game costs \u00a326, but last year letters were sent to more than 500 alleged filesharers demanding they pay a \u00a3340 settlement or face the prospect of further court action.

  "<p>One of the most striking aspects of the Georgia crisis is the collective sense of horror in the west. Look what the Russians have done! With no warning! As the Olympic games are under way! How unsporting! How dare they? Isn't it awful?</p> <p>These and other such cries are understandable but redundant: there is remarkably little surprising about what Russia has done, however awful. It is both repeating and creating history, and the signs have long been around pointing in that direction. The major issue now is to collate an appropriate western response, but unfortunately the chances for that appear very slim: both the US and the EU are weak. The irony is that Russia is too, but nobody seems capable of seeing that beyond the disgust and alarm.</p> <p>History shows us that Russia has a particular fancy for the Olympic years: in 1956 it went for Hungary; in 1968 it was the turn of poor Czechoslovakia; and 1980 saw the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This is probably not by chance, as Ari Shavit <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011411.html\">points out</a> in a perceptive article in Ha'aretz, Olympic years are also US election years, when the single superpower tends to be even more internally focused than usual. However, such an explanation is inadequate for the current aggression: Russia undoubtedly timed events to coincide with the opening ceremonies in Beijing, to ensure the eyes of the world were elsewhere \u2013 but it is making a point that goes far beyond internal US politics. </p> <p>Russia is about hegemony: reasserting that which it lost at the end of the cold war, and asserting its new found economic power. For Russia, power is about being powerful, and ensuring everyone knows this fact and respects it \u2013 it is not about doing anything. That is probably the single most salient difference between the US and Russia, and possibly west and east: the US and all democracies ultimately see power as the supreme enabler of freedom, especially the free movements of people and goods, in which all are equal before the law. Russia, China, and other non-democratic regimes, see power as an enabler of control, through fear and respect \u2013 with the laws created and interpreted accordingly. Moreover, this has always been the case in Russia, where has never been any democratic tradition.</p> <p>This point has been systematically misunderstood, or ignored, in the west even though it is absolutely crucial to understanding Russia \u2013 as a culture and as an opponent. When the USSR collapsed, much was made of 70 years of oppression ending with it \u2013 as though beforehand there had been anything but an equally oppressive tsarist regime, a long-standing regime in which power was a means of fearful control. Such facts were seen as irrelevant: freedom would sweep away all, since it had always empowered the west. The idea that freedom could lead to chaos, as it did in the early 1990s in Russia, or that it is not synonymous with democracy but rather a crucial part of a much more complicated cultural system built up over centuries in the west, did not seem to occur to many. In the US interpretation, and ultimately the European one, Russia was automatically converted to democracy by simple dint of no longer being a communist state. </p> <p>Every aberration from this fantasy has been explained away by circumstances, lack of time elapsed since the end of the cold war \u2013 and ultimately the rise of Putin: Vlad the Bad has driven Russia back to non-democracy, and that's that. This is undoubtedly true, but it cannot account for the fact that the vast majority of the Russian people hate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin\">Yeltsin</a>, who allowed democracy and chaos, and love the current situation in which they feel secure and know what to expect. For ultimately, Russians are of Russia: they feel Putin et al have returned power to the motherland, at home and abroad. </p> <p>So why does it all matter? Because Russia is an opponent, sometimes friendly and sometimes not, and a basic law of all confrontation management must be a thorough understanding of an opponent and his motivations. The west, and especially the US, has fundamentally failed in this respect, preferring to live by labels and wishful thinking regarding Russia rather than a proper examination of realities past and present. As a result, for the past decade, and specifically in the Bush-Putin era, there has been a systematic inability to engage constructively with it: the US and the west tended to address it as effectively an aberrant democracy, possibly taken over by resurgent Soviet elements, that for some reason would be awed by the US and all it stands for, rather than a power seeking autocracy with strong cultural and historical roots. Above all, it has failed to see, and therefore accept, that Russia has a fundamentally different view of the world and its role within it from that allocated to it by the west \u2013 and that for the past several years it has been operating within these divergent views and roles.</p> <p>Events of the past week have shown the fatuousness of this thinking: Russia has acted out its destiny as it sees it. It is also hugely savouring the finger-pointing between the US and the EU over blame for apparently allowing it to safeguard this destiny, and is hoping for more. Probably the only reason it will not get immediate satisfaction is that this is August, and most westerners are on holiday regardless of the state of the world. But there is every reason to expect this pointless dispute \u2013 pointless in that it will have no effect on western relations with Russia \u2013 to continue: since the crisis started not a single US or European leader or commentator, possibly barring Chancellor Angela Merkel, reflect an understanding of Russia and its motivations based within a proper cultural and historical dimension. Instead we have been subjected to US sabre-rattling and EU cowering, both of which are reactions that have given the Russians exactly what they want: a feeling of being powerful.</p>",
  "<p>Russia last night continued to occupy large swaths of Georgia in defiance of an EU-brokered ceasefire deal, with no sign of significant troop withdrawals. </p> <p>Despite claims by Moscow that a pullout had begun, Russian forces could be seen across most of the country, and Georgian officials claimed that armoured columns had tried to push further into the mountainous heartland, towards Borjomi in the south and Sachkhere in the west.</p> <p>\"We could leave here in two minutes. But we've had no orders to pull out,\" said a Russian soldier manning a checkpoint yesterday about 25 miles west of the capital, Tbilisi. He knew nothing about a ceasefire. </p> <p>Georgia's foreign minister, Eka Tkeshelashvili, said Russian troops had razed a Georgian military base at the western city of Senaki.</p> <p>\"Practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all. What they're trying to do is to widen their territorial presence,\" Tkeshelashvili said before flying to Brussels to appeal for support from Nato foreign ministers today. \"They have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action. They are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now.\"</p> <p>She said she would call for punitive diplomatic measures against Russia, excluding Moscow from international institutions, if Moscow refused to comply.</p> <p>A Georgian interior ministry spokesman said columns of Russian armoured vehicles were stopped by police roadblocks outside Borjomi and Sachkhere and agreed to turn back. But another column broke through a similar roadblock west of Tbilisi.</p> <p>One report circulated yesterday evening suggested the Russian forces would only begin their promised withdrawal after nightfall, and Georgian officials said they would review the situation in the morning after further international pressure.</p> <p>\"I might be naive, but I'm still hopeful that a very strong, common effort by Europe and the United States will be effective in the withdrawing of Russian troops from territory of Georgia,\" Tkeshelashvili said. \"We'll see how well grounded my expectation is.\"</p> <p>President Dmitry Medvedev vowed to initiate a troop withdrawal yesterday after signing the agreement on Saturday. On Sunday he told France's president Nicholas Sarkozy a pullout was imminent. </p> <p>Last night Russian officers insisted that the withdrawal was already happening. In Moscow the deputy chief of staff, Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said: \"According to the peace plan, the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun.\" This included Gori, he added. </p> <p>Russian officials across the border in North Ossetia echoed this. \"War columns are already leaving. The main pullout will take place today. It takes a long time to pack up a tank,\" a Russian spokesman in the North Ossetia capital, Vladikavkaz, said. \"We are talking days not weeks.\" </p> <p>Another Russian military spokesman, Lieutenant General Nikolay Uvarov, told the BBC last night that Russian forces had left Gori, which lies on the main east-west highway running through the heart of the country. However, Russian troops were very much in evidence in the town, and at checkpoints between Tbilisi and Gori, searching cars and cutting the road between east and west Georgia. Nor was there a sign of military movement from Gori north towards South Ossetia. </p> <p>Georgian officials also claimed the Russians were busy laying mines. Tkeshelashvili said that one of her principal appeals to Nato today will be for help in demining.</p> <p>Russia's most forward position last night was where it had been for the past few days, at Igoeti, 27 miles from the capital. Russian tanks were visible today in the surrounding wooded hills. An armoured vehicle also ploughed into a line of stationary Georgian police cars.</p> <p>\"Russian forces are not leaving. They are merely rotating their hardware. One comes, another one goes,\" said Irakly Porchkhidze, a Georgian government official inside Gori, where humanitarian relief was arriving today. He added: \"There is no pullout.\" </p> <p>There was growing concern that the Kremlin plans to exploit ambiguities in the Sarkozy-drafted agreement to justify a semi-permanent presence inside Georgia's borders. Moscow today indicated it intended to deploy its forces under an internationally brokered peace agreement in 1999, allowing Russia a generous \"security zone\". The zone extends nine miles around Tskhinvali and allows a \"corridor\" into Georgian areas. The document was designed to end the Georgian-Ossetian conflict and agreed by a joint control commission, an international body. The Georgian foreign minister, Tkeshelashvili, said the 1999 deal only allowed Russia a maximum of 500 peacekeepers, not to garrison towns or set up checkpoints.</p> <p>Additionally, South Ossetian militias yesterday said they had no intention of handing back territory. On Saturday the militias, supported by Russian heavy armour, seized Akhalgori, 25 miles north-west of Tbilisi. \"This is now ours. It's Ossetian land,\" one militia man said yesterday morning. </p> <p>The town was under the control of South Ossetia's interior ministry and police administration, he said. The Georgian flag had been replaced by a white, red and yellow Ossetian one.</p>",
  "<p>Light aircraft and microlights enjoy the freedom of Britain's skies \u2013 a pilot may need to do no more than phone the local aerodrome before setting off. They do not even need to have a radio on board.</p> <p>\"The air is very big. Think of a motorway \u2013 you've got a car travelling at 80mph in the fast lane, and one doing the same on the other side. There's not much distance between them. In the air if you were that close we'd be very concerned,\" said Peter Harvey, the chief executive of the Light Aircraft Association (LAA).</p> <p>Controlled airspace is categorised according to volume and type of traffic. Light aircraft are not allowed into a category A area - for example, London - but in less congested skies a pilot may simply be advised to ring his destination aerodrome in advance to check the flightpaths are unchanged.</p> <p>\"There are different levels, but somewhere like Coventry [where yesterday's crash occurred] will have an air traffic control and you'd generally expect most aircraft to be in contact. If you're taking off, you might pre-book.</p> <p>\"Not every aircraft has a radio \u2013 it's not a requirement \u2013 although a lot of them will have a hand-held radio because they like to know what's going on. Overall, it's a very well-proven, safe regime.\"</p> <p>Around the Birmingham and East Midlands aerodromes there are areas of protected air space. The rules of flying within controlled airspace - from a plane's airworthiness to the licensing of air traffic controllers - is covered by air navigation orders.</p> <p>In the UK there are 2,300 light aircraft, built by amateurs from scratch or from a kit. A further 1,700 are under construction and, before taking to the air, will be tested for safety by the LAA, which holds powers delegated by the Civil Aviation Authority.</p> <p>\"It's very tightly regulated,\" he said. \"All the designs have to be approved and the build quality has to be to a very high level of airworthiness. Everyone who flies is really concerned about safety.\"</p> <p>A CAA spokesman said the authority was encouraging all pilots of light aircraft to carry transponders, allowing air traffic control and other planes to pick up and identify them.</p>",
  "<p>It was not the way <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\">Pervez Musharraf</a> would have wanted to go. Hugely unpopular at home and spurned by his traditional allies in the military, the Pakistani leader will be unlamented domestically. </p> <p>Although his fall is due partly to his own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan1\">bumbling errors</a>, there is little doubt that his support for America's war on Islamist militants accounts for most of his unpopularity. Musharraf has been in the same position as a number of leaders around the world who have spent the years after 9/11 struggling to balance demands for cooperation with the US and the cost this exerts on their standing at home.</p> <p>Take the Kenyan president, Mwai Kibaki, for example. A little-remarked facet of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mwai_Kibaki#2007_elections\">travails at the ballot box</a> late last year was the fact the Muslim population in that country solidly rejected him, thus tipping a close election in the opposition's favour.</p> <p>The president's Party of National Unity (PNU) was routed in areas with a large Muslim population. It did not secure a single parliamentary or civic seat in the predominantly Muslim coastal island of Mombasa and fared equally dismally in other Muslim areas. In all these regions, the Kibaki administration's solid cooperation with the US in confronting Islamic militancy was the central election issue.</p> <p>The Americans have long viewed Kenya as an important ally in their efforts to tackle extremism in the Horn of Africa. The US embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998 highlighted this threat. And after the September 11 attacks, the Bush administration ramped up its efforts to use Kenya as a launching pad for its anti-terror operations in the region.</p> <p>Like Musharraf's regime, the Kibaki administration received millions of dollars in national security funds. And just as Pakistan gave the green light for US air force sorties in its restive North-West Frontier province, Kenyan bases are believed to have been used for repeated air raids in neighbouring Somalia, including <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7378502.stm\">one earlier this year</a> in which a leading militant was killed.</p> <p>Kenya, like Pakistan, has also handed over a number of militants to the US, such as Abdul Malik, a suspect in the 2002 attacks in a coastal resort in Mombasa, who was shipped off to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in March last year. This cooperation has come at considerable cost to the government.</p> <p>The most recent developments in Pakistan \u2013 and more pertinently the negative reaction at the ballot box last year \u2013 could well lead to a reappraisal of engagement with the US.</p> <p>In Kenya, local politicians have long counselled that a broader US investment in the capabilities of the corrupt and inefficient local police force would be more welcome than the current sole focus on terrorism. Few Kenyans lose sleep over terror attacks in the country but insecurity is a constant worry.</p> <p>American partnership in helping set up a forensic laboratory for local police \u2013 a longstanding request held up by lack of budgetary support \u2013 is one example that would have benefits for both the US and Kenya.</p> <p>Greater investment in training, and improved benefits such as insurance and healthcare, might help to curb corruption in the forces. This would simultaneously mean a more efficient anti-terror operation and possibly check the mysterious disappearing acts of suspects such as one of al-Qaida's most wanted men in Africa, <a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorists/termohammed.htm\">Fazul Abdullah Mohammed</a>, who has repeatedly eluded capture despite being located several times by local police. Inevitable <a href=\"http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/-/440808/457090/-/3ko8o2/-/index.html\">whispers of complicity</a> have accompanied every reported escape.</p> <p>In the end, the US may have no real option but to refashion its relationship with allies if it is to expect continued cooperation in its anti-terror campaigns.</p> <p>Musharraf's ignominious exit and, to a lesser extent, Kibaki's troubles at the ballot box could mean that self-interest drives leaders to conclude that the unpopularity resulting from engagement with America is too high a price to pay.</p>",

Go Dumb Go Thick is a supermix of disco and funk samples, sleights of turntable, and a dizzying array of fast-cut references to everything from George Clinton to Rin Tin Tin that recalls nothing so much as The Adventures Of Grandmaster Flash On The Wheels Of Steel, that early 80s smorgasbord of sounds and snippets, with echoes of Afrika Bambaataa's jungle boogie. No wonder they call themselves \"Neo-electro Afrobotic ethnotechno mamas' boys.\" It's sick. No, no, it's stupid fresh. It makes you want to go wicky-wicky and spin on your head. <br> We've seen Playdoe referenced in the context of \"kwaito\", a musical movement that emerged from Johannesburg with all manner of social, cultural and political connotations and affiliations. Apparently, kwaito means \"angry\" and comprises a mix of deep house, hip hop, African melody and percussion, with MCs shouting or chanting in the local slang Tsotsitaal (\"thug language\"). The so-called kwaito generation also have their own drug, nyope (a mix of weed and heroin), and have close associations with illegal train surfing. Kwaito the music, meanwhile, is meant to be an ethno-bleepfest, like Aphex Twin in Africa, while the duo are said to be influenced by early afrobeat, dancehall, ghetto-tech, and UK grime.</p> <p>Now, all of this sounds really appealing, but a bit far-fetched and wide of the mark from what we've heard so far of Playdoe, although there is talk of tracks like Pop Like This on their debut mini-album - from Try Harder, the label that brought us Foals, Blood Red Shoes and Youthmovies - bearing traces of Casiotone synthpop and new wave disco-rock. Mainly, though \u2013 and we're not complaining at all \u2013 Mr Mathambo and his mate Fuck sound like feelgood, good-time, sampladelic revivalists. Great. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"African noise for the ass and the tit.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They're doing for 1981 electro what the Cool Kids have done for 1989 hip hop. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Have an adventure, probably involving some wheels of steel. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Sound remotely angry. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut mini-album It's That Beat is released by Try Harder on October 6. Download single It's That Beat is available from September 22. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Mantronix, Funky Four Plus One. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/fuckplaydoe\">MySpace.com/fuckplaydoe</a><br> Tuesday's new band: Gold Teeth.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/09/hardlabour\">anti-worker dictatorship</a> in Iran has stepped up its attacks on labour activists, with a new wave of <a href=\"http://www.workers-iran.org/\">arrests and jailings</a>. </p> <p>Among those recently jailed were two workers' rights campaigners, Sousan Razani and Shiva Kheirabadi. They have been sentenced to 15 lashes and four months in prison for the \"crime\" (under Iran's Islamic law) of participating in a May Day celebration in the city of Sanandaj earlier this year. The verdicts were issued by the criminal court of Sanandaj \u2013 branch 101.</p> <p>On the same charges the same court sentenced Abdullah Khani to 91 days in prison and 40 lashes and Seyed Qaleb Hosseini to six months and 50 lashes.</p> <p>In addition, Khaled Hosseini, a worker activist, was given a 91 day suspended sentence and 30 lashes because of his efforts to support the trade union leader, Mahmoud Salehi, who was imprisoned at the time and was being denied medical treatment. The charges against him include \"disturbing public order and agitation.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/06/iransunionheroes\">Mansour Osanloo</a>, leader of Tehran's bus workers syndicate, remains in jail since he was sentenced to five years in July 2007 for his union activities. </p> <p>Nine of his union members have recently had their dismissal from their jobs upheld by the Islamic courts, which do not recognise trade unions or workers rights. The sacked men were all bus drivers, who had suffered two years of harassment and victimisation for the \"crime\" of establishing a free and independent trade union.</p> <p>Another labour activist, Afshin Shams, was arrested in July 2008. He is a member of the coordinating committee to help form workers' organisations, and a member of the committee in defence of Mahmoud Salehi.</p> <p>These arrests and jailings coincide with a wave of strikes and demonstrations against profiteering, corruption and shady business dealings by the country's political and religious elite, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/25/iran.middleeast\">reported</a> in the Guardian last month. Many of the strikes are in response to President Ahmadinejad's collusion with employers who are pushing through redundancies, withholding pay and forcing down wages. </p> <p>Workers at the Alborz tire manufacturing company are owed two to five months pay. At the Shahryar Dam in Mianeh, the staff have not been paid for four months. More than 40 workers of Mahloran company in Borujerd city have been unpaid for seven months. Last week, employees at the Sanandaj textile company were violently attacked when they held a rally in Farvardin Square in protest at the sudden shutdown of plant operations and mass lay-offs.</p> <p>Workers at the Haft Tapeh sugar cane company, which employs more than 5,000, have been on strike too. The last time they took industrial action, they won three months of unpaid wages. </p> <p>The strikers have been buoyed by the success of the Khodro car workers who walked out in June to demand wage increases and an end to mandatory overtime \u2013 and won. </p> <p>The Tehran regime is increasingly hostile to rising working-class militancy, which it fears could become political and turn into a mass movement against the government. The ruling elite are particularly nervous of the possibility that the unions might link up with students, leftwingers, civic organisations and oppressed national minorities (like the Arabs, Kurds and Baluchs) to form a united front for a free and democratic federal state. </p> <p>Tehran's crackdown on union activists is, in fact, part of a broader <a href=\"http://hrw.org/reports/2008/iran0108/iran0108web.pdf\">assault (pdf)</a> on civil society and campaign groups, as the rightwing Islamist regime in Tehran seeks to stifle dissent and tighten its grip on power. This repression includes a rise in death sentences on opposition activists. In Baluchistan, an estimated 700 nationalist and human rights campaigners are on death row. </p> <p>Even small, peaceful and lawful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/mar/07/tehransheroicwomen\">protests by women</a> are violently suppressed, which is more evidence of the regime's insecurity and tyranny. </p> <p>The persecution of Kurdish Iranians is typical. On July 20 2008, Farzad Kamangar was sentenced to death in a seven minute show trial, in which three minutes were taken up by the prosecutor reading the allegations and the defence was given a mere four minutes to state its case. Kamangar's lawyer was never notified prior to the trial of the offence with which his client was charged. </p> <p>Kamangar, a young teacher, was originally incarcerated on 18 August 2006. He was tortured over allegations (probably trumped up) of collaborating with the Pejak party, being a member of Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), transporting explosives and various other doubtful accusations. Since then, he has been transferred from one jail to another, from one city to another and from one judicial and security jurisdiction to another. The government has ignored all Iranian and international pleas for clemency. </p> <p>Thirty people were executed on 27 July 2008 in Tehran. Saeed Mortazavi, the attorney general, denounced them as \"drug dealers, murders and insurgents\". A confidential source inside the public prosecutor's office reported that some of them were people who had participated in the mass protests against gas price increases last year. \"The execution of these people is in accordance with the new regulations called the social security enhancement plan\", Saeed Mortazavi is reported to have said. This plan is the regime's hardline strategy to crush criticism, dissent and protest. </p> <p>Mohammad Mostafaee, a defence lawyer, seemed to cast doubt on official claims about the crimes of the executed men. He told Deutsche Welle:</p> <blockquote> <p>My understanding is that these so-called insurgents are special people. The date of their execution is not a routine practice. Normally, every last Wednesday of each month, the Tehran criminal prosecutor's office carries out the executions, but in this case they will be executed on Sunday. These are people who have had their trial in either Enghelab Islami (Islamic Revolutionary) courts or in the special crimes' courts.</p> </blockquote> <p>This explanation implies that at least some of those who were executed were probably not common criminals, but deemed to be more serious and threatening political protesters. </p> <p>While the people of Iran, including oppositionists, do not want a western military attack on their country, growing numbers do want democracy, human rights, social justice, trade union rights and an end to Tehran's neocolonial subjugation of ethnic minority peoples. </p> <p>You can support Iran's heroic trade union activists by <a href=\"http://www.labourstart.org/actnowen.shtml\">signing this petition</a> and by supporting the <a href=\"http://www.workers-iran.org\">International Alliance in Support of Workers in Iran</a>. You can also show your solidarity with the Iranian people by joining <a href=\"http://www.hopoi.org/\">Hands Off the People of Iran</a>, which campaigns both against a military attack on Iran and against Tehran's neoliberal despotism. </p> <p>Together, we can all do something to help our beleaguered sisters and brothers in Iran. Like us, they want freedom and equality. And they deserve it too.</p>",
  "<p>If you have been paying attention to the presidential pageant currently winding its way through the United States, then you're <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-17-mccain-adviser_N.htm\">probably aware</a> that Republican nominee John McCain is partial to the economic plight of <a href=\"http://mediamattersaction.org/freeride/lobbyists/\">Washington DC lobbyists</a>. So much so that he has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022101131_pf.html\">offered dozens of them stable employment</a> in the highest echelons of his campaign for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Many political prognosticators, including this columnist and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Real-McCain-Conservatives-Independents-Shouldnt/dp/0979482291\">author of a book</a> on the Arizona political pugilist, have long thought that his unseemly connection to a cabal of DC glitterati who have advocated for all manner of controversial clientele - from the needs of Blackwater mercenaries to the wants of the brutal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko\">tyrant Mobuto Sese Seko</a> - would be McCain's undoing.</p> <p>But, as the late Democratic speaker of the US House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill, once put it: \"All politics is local\". It is that fact that may be not only the undoing of McCain but also of his political party.</p> <p>Let me explain.</p> <p>Recently it has <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-campaign8-2008aug08,0,6428374.story\">come to light</a> that McCain and his campaign manager-cum-lobbyist, Rick Davis, played a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/08/plouffe-mccains-dhl-deal_n_117790.html\">lead role</a> in facilitating a deal that will likely lead to the foreign-owned package delivery service DHL relocating up to 10,000 jobs out of Southern Ohio. Davis was paid almost $200,000 to lobby for the deal, and McCain, who he lobbied, fought for it in the Senate.</p> <p>And this could be the issue that costs McCain the presidency and his party Congressional seats for years to come. Ohioans have suffered through years of job losses due to trade, tax and regulatory bamboozling that have sent manufacturing and other core industries to \"outsource\" workers. It has led to not only a rational fear of job losses here (I live in the great state of Ohio), but an equally rational resentment of the money men and their political pawns in Washington who view a 30-year career on the assembly line as just a statistic. To fully appreciate this one need only look at a Quinnipiac poll in June this year, where 81% of Ohioans have a negative view of the state's economy.</p> <p>People in this part of the country are - to quote <a href=\"http://www.americanrhetoric.com/MovieSpeeches/moviespeechnetwork2.html\">Howard Beale from the movie Network</a> - \"mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.\" And, to paraphrase a slogan for Las Vegas: what happens in southern Ohio doesn't simply stay in southern Ohio. It affects how people in other parts of the state, not to mention Missouri, Indiana, Michigan and Iowa - swing states all - view this election.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/08/plouffe-mccains-dhl-deal_n_117790.html\">Obama campaign</a>, sensing this, has released <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/08/15/1268992.aspx\">television and radio ads</a> in the Cincinnati market here (which reaches beyond Ohio's borders), pointing out John McCain's tawdry role in this affair. The <a href=\"http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/08/11/mccain-should-fire-lobbyist-who-killed-ohio-jobs/\">AFL-CIO, sensing a similar opportunity</a>, has sent mailers out to Ohioans that do the same.</p> <p>What makes this even a bigger deal is that Ohio, considered one of two key swing states (Florida being the other one) and a large state (the seventh largest), has gone through a political sea-change over the past few years. After a string of corruption scandals rocked Republican officeholders and financiers in the state - sending a handful to prison - <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/us/politics/08ohio.html\">Democrats were swept into power in 2006</a>, picking up the Ohio governor's mansion, a congressional seat, a host of other executive positions (such as state treasurer and secretary of state) and seven state house seats. President Bush's anthrax-like popularity, the war in Iraq and job losses have only made matters worse for the GOP.</p> <p>So McCain might be the least of their worries. Five Republican congressional seats in Ohio are vulnerable to Democratic takeover. More importantly, the state house in Ohio is ripe for Democratic picking, as Republicans can only afford to lose three seats and still hold their majority.</p> <p>Why do I grant control of Ohio's state house such outsized importance? Because it will play an enormous role in redrawing US congressional districts in Ohio in 2010 - as is done in each state every 10 years - along with the governor and state senate. The Ohio state senate will likely still be held by the GOP at that time, but if Democrats have the governor's mansion and the state house, they could create a map that would turn about a dozen congressional seats to being solidly Democratic - through locking in victories by candidates this year with more Democratic districts and eliminating two Republican seats outright (the state has lost population, so a two-seat decline is expected). This could play a big role in ensuring Democratic control of congress for the coming decade.</p> <p>And the final cloud, in what is becoming the perfect storm, is the unmasking of how John McCain and his campaign manager are beholden to corporate interests, whatever they pretend when they are swinging through Ohio on a campaign stop.</p> <p>Can you think of a better definition of poetic justice?</p>",
  "<p>The success of the Chinese gymnasts in the final of the uneven bars apparatus - He Kexin won the gold medal and Yang Yilin the bronze \u2013 has stirred up the controversy of whether either gymnast has reached the qualifying age for international competition.</p> <p>In 1997, to counter the increasing trend towards younger and younger gymnasts, the International Gymnastics Federation introduced a rule that competitors must be 16 in the year that the event is held.</p> <p>Online documents, listed in a series of articles by The New York Times and followed up by Associated Press at the end of July and in August, call into question whether either of the gymnasts will reach their 16th birthday this year.</p> <p>The documents relating to He include a page from the Chengdu Sports Bureau website from 2006, which gave her year of birth as 1994, a report in last November's Cities Games at Wuhan which gave her age then as 13, and a story in the China Daily newspaper in May this year, which gave her age as 14.<br> Yang's age was given in online files from the General Administration of Sport in China. Records from 2004, 2005 and 2006 give her date of birth as August 26th 1993. That would make Yang only 15 this year, and 14 when she competed in last year's world championships.</p> <p>When the information concerning He was presented to the International Gymnastics Federation, the secretary-general Andre Gueisbuhler said: \"We heard these rumours and we immediately wrote to the Chinese gymnastics federation. They immediately sent a copy of the passport, showing the age, and everything is OK. That's all we can check,\" he said.</p> <p>Underage stories have frequently surfaced since the rule was brought in. In 2002, the Romanian federation admitted that gymnasts' ages had been falsified and China's Yang Yun, who won two bronze medals in Sydney, later admitted that she was 14 at the time. The worst culprit, though, was the North Korean federation, which listed one athlete as 15 for three successive years so that she could contest age-group championships.</p> <p>The visual evidence that He is underage certainly supports the online research, for the Olympic champion is certainly not an inch taller nor a pound heavier than the 4ft 8in and 73lb that are listed in the official information system. One British journalist was bundled out when he tried to take a picture of her in the area where journalist and competitors mix after the competition.</p> <p>Britain's Beth Tweddle, who finished in fourth position, would not be drawn into the controversy, even though it could mean she was cheated out of the silver medal. The Liverpool gymnast is talking of staying on until London in 2012 and having one more shot at the Olympics. By that time she will be 27. If the age-group rules are by-passed in London, Tweddle could find herself competing against gymnasts who could be almost half her age.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/18/musharraf\">resignation of Pervez Musharraf</a> poses questions, yet again, about the fate of a clandestine nuclear arsenal run by a state in crisis. Musharraf may justifiably have run out of road, but it is not clear that the political transition in Pakistan will reassure its neighbours, or the west, about the nuclear safety of the region. There will be some anxious months to come for the security services in Washington and London, not to mention Delhi.</p> <p>It could be worse. Pakistan's <a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat\">nuclear arsenal</a> is generally reckoned to consist of up to 100 deployable warheads, though estimates vary. It is a fairly sophisticated arsenal mostly derived \u2013 despite some key Chinese help \u2013 from indigenous Pakistani technologies. It represents a considerable technological achievement; evidence that the force is also professional and under control. The command arrangements for nuclear release were all beefed up when Musharraf nailed his flag to the mast of America's \"war on terror\", and he received at least $100m in US aid for nuclear safety, within the $10bn military assistance packages he got in return from Washington. Pakistan's nuclear warheads are kept disassembled and away from their delivery vehicles. The force is claimed to be a \"minimum credible deterrent\" designed primarily to deter the use of Indian nuclear weapons.</p> <p>But we do not know how robust these procedures will be when the relationship between the military and a new political authority in Islamabad is being redefined. The military will make reassuring constitutional noises about political authority and nuclear command procedures. But Delhi is convinced that the infamous Inter-Services Intelligence agency is still calling too many of Pakistan's strategic shots and is growing again in stature. </p> <p>Explicit US influence on Musharraf was one of the causes of his political downfall and Islamabad will be anxious to distance itself from anything that looks like another client relationship with Washington. This, too, worries politicians in India. Both India and Pakistan approached war over Kashmir in 1999 and again in 2002 and rumours abounded both times that Pakistan's warheads were beginning to be \"assembled\". There will be even less the US can do to damp down such tensions in another crisis.</p> <p>Most worrying of all though is the \"loose nuke\"' problem. Pakistan has been an active proliferator while building its impressive nuclear capability. The architect of that achievement, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/22/pakistan\">AQ Khan</a>, was running a vast personal network of nuclear secrets to other countries \u2013 particularly Iran \u2013 for over 20 years before he was exposed in 2004. The Pakistani government was less than harsh with him and western intelligence agencies report that significant parts of his personal network are still operational.</p> <p>A crisis of central authority in Islamabad would allow this sort of personal enterprise even more latitude. The north-western borders of the country are run by warlords and remain the home of the al-Qaida core organisation. Al-Qaida is known to have approached Pakistani scientists in the past for access to nuclear technologies. They may do so with more success in the future.</p> <p>The US and its western allies may find ways of engaging with a more credible government in Islamabad that keeps Pakistan's nuclear forces under tight control and builds another period of detente with India. But even according to this optimistic scenario there will still be the problem that Pakistan's nuclear capabilities have a tendency to leak elsewhere, whatever the government does. Musharraf's removal will open some new possibilities for the private proliferator. There is very little that western powers can do about this other than to keep spying on it.</p>",
  "<p>The gender war \u2013 sorry for the macho language \u2013 is beginning to feel like the western front in January 1918. It is still deadly out there, but no one can quite remember why. There is a muddle of familiar ideas and the undigested consequences of well-intentioned legislation; the politicians say the right thing, and some of them may even believe it, but a lot of their supporters think it is political correctness gone mad. This is a first attempt at trying to untangle it.</p> <p>The debate over gender equality seems to me to have become disconnected from people's experience. It is reported in tired old terms. Its destination is hazy, the arguments conducted along well-trodden parallel paths that no longer lead anywhere interesting, let alone unexpected. </p> <p>In public discourse it is so much taken for granted that women are there simply as a kind of high visibility symbol of a way of doing business, kevlar-coated indicators of a modern, inclusive organisation, that their contribution to the job is almost obscured. </p> <p>A talented lawyer recently told me she would not apply to be a high court judge because she knew that if she got it, people would assume it was not on merit but because she's a woman. When the chief secretary to the Treasury, who happens to be a woman, launches the government's much-anticipated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/davidcameron.conservatives\">attack on David Cameron</a> in today's Guardian, somehow her gender is taken to be part of the attack.</p> <p>The Tory leader appeals to women, women listen to other women, so Yvette Cooper is leading the charge. Not because she's an effective performer and No 2 at the Treasury, talking about the economy, of course, but because she's a woman.</p> <p>There was more in this sort of vein over the weekend. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2571141/Conservative-leader-David-Cameron-plans-to-promote-young-women.html\">Telegraph reported</a> that Cameron was scouring his backbenches for female talent to promote in an autumn reshuffle \u2013 likely to be forced on him if his party chair, Caroline Spelman, is criticised by the inquiry into her use of parliamentary expenses to pay for her nanny and has to go. </p> <p>The Tory ginger group website, Conservative Home, runs regular popularity polls for the shadow cabinet. This month, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2008/08/caroline-spelma.html\">Spelman</a> is at the bottom, along with most of the top Tory women. Read the comments, and it seems the weight of opinion is that these are people who have been promoted for their gender and so, as night follows day, not up to the job. </p> <p>Meanwhile the real reason why this matters \u2013 the loss of opportunity and the financial and social injustice experienced by women because of deeply embedded discrimination \u2013 is lost. (No one points out the injustice, in the Spelman case, of being required by her constituency party to educate her children in her West Midlands seat despite the unavoidability of being based in London. Did they ask that of the male candidates? Or was it one of those undetectable pieces of discrimination favoured by employers? Or was it simply unintended?)</p> <p>Nicola Brewer of the Equalities Commission <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article4327438.ece\">pointed out</a> the unintended discrimination of legislation that presumes mothers are the main carers. Jackie Scott added a further dimension with her analysis of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/06/equality.gender\">attitudes to working mothers</a>, widely misunderstood as a call for mothers to stay home, rather than the more complex idea that in some parts of the world \u2013 the US, and here in the UK \u2013 opinion is swinging towards the proposition that working mothers damaged family life. </p> <p>The debate has to refocus on where we have got to, on progress so far. It means learning the lessons of failure. It means rethinking how legislation is framed, revaluing work in the home, reassessing the importance of caring, tackling both the underpaid part-time migrant worker and the excluded city lawyer. In short, it means 21st century feminism.</p>",
  "<p>Edinburgh University Press has defended its decision to publish two works, written by Sir Walter Scott after he had suffered a series of strokes, and long considered inappropriate for publication. </p> <p>Scott wrote The Siege of Malta (an account of the defence of Malta against Ottoman forces) and the unfinished novella Bizarro (the story of a 19th century Calabrian brigand) in 1831 and 1832 after being sent abroad for his failing health. His son-in-law and biographer John Gibson Lockhart judged them undecipherable and unfit for publication, and later expressed the hope they would never see the light. John Buchan's 1932 life of Scott asked \"that no literary resurrectionist will ever be guilty of the crime of giving them to the world\".</p> <p>But Edinburgh University Press has now published the works in a combined edition which it says remains \"broadly faithful to the manuscripts\", while also \"tidying them up\".</p> <p>\"Most of it is incredibly chaotic,\" said John Sutherland, Scott biographer and professor of modern English Literature at University College London. \"It does indicate a very wonderful mind, completely buggered up by explosions in the head.\" </p> <p>Sutherland pointed to Donald Sultana's previous attempt to reconstruct the text in 1977, The Siege of Malta Rediscovered: An Account of Sir Walter Scott's Mediterranean Journey and His Last Novel. \"[Sultana's] view was that Scott's brain was too clouded, and I think my personal feeling is that Sultana had done everything that could be done with the work, very reverently, after a huge amount of research,\" Sutherland said. \"I respect what [Edinburgh University Press] is doing - if you're going to do something complete you might as well [publish everything]. But I don't think Scott would have wanted it published himself.\" </p> <p>Edinburgh University Press marketing executive Catriona Murray admitted that some critics felt the works \"shouldn't have been published because Walter Scott was not quite himself, and that his son-in-law had expressed a wish that it should not be published\".</p> <p>But she said that in order to give a complete picture of Scott it was important they be published alongside his other writing. \"We feel these are interesting, valuable works and should be made available to people,\" she said. \"The editors have worked very hard to render them understandable.\"</p> <p>Editor Ian Alexander said the controversy arose around the decision to give the works \"a proper edit\", providing punctuation, undoing Scott's habit of \"repeating words very close to each other in a clumsy way\" and correcting spellings. \"There's no sense that there is anything disrespectful about this,\" he added. \"We have spent our lives working on Scott and nobody has more respect for him than we do. He was an enormously admirable writer, even when his powers were failing.\"</p> <p>Addressing comments that the publication of the works was \"literary grave-robbing\", Sutherland said that it had \"happened before\" in rather more literal fashion, when Dante Gabriel Rossetti exhumed his wife Elizabeth's coffin to find a notebook of his poems he had buried with her. \"And if you're grave-robbing anywhere it might as well be Scotland \u2013 Burke and Hare invented the thing,\" he added.\"</p>",
  "<p>Silvio Berlusconi's government was today engaged in a vigorous damage limitation exercise after Pope Benedict appeared to lend his immense moral authority to speculation that Italy was in danger of returning to fascism under the tycoon's hardline, rightwing leadership.</p> <p>In his customary midday Sunday address, the pontiff expressed concern at \"recent examples of racism\" and reminded Catholics it was their duty to steer others in society away from \"racism, intolerance and [the] exclusion [of others]\".</p> <p>On any other day, his remarks might have been seen as no more than a restatement of official Catholic doctrine. But they came instead in the midst of a furious dispute over an editorial published by Italy's bestselling Catholic weekly, Famiglia Cristiana.</p> <p>In an editorial on Friday, condemning recent government moves against immigrants and Roma, the magazine said it was to be hoped fascism was not \"resurfacing in our country under another guise\". The jibe outraged Berlusconi's supporters, many of whom are themselves pious Catholics.</p> <p>The leader of his parliamentary group in the upper house, Maurizio Gasparri, announced he would personally sue the priest who is Famiglia Cristiana's editor while the junior minister with responsibility for family affairs, Carlo Giovanardi, said the magazine was \"possessed by ideological malice\". </p> <p>In an effort to calm the row, the Vatican's spokesman put out a statement stressing that Famiglia Cristiana was not authorised to speak on behalf of either the Holy See or the Italian bishops' conference - something which, as the magazine's editor noted, it had never anyway claimed to do.</p> <p>Coming against this background, the pope's comments were interpreted by Berlusconi's critics as a signal that the Vatican was not climbing down or distancing itself from Famiglia Cristiana's interpretation. </p> <p>Benedict cited in his address the story from Matthew's gospel of Jesus's encounter with a pagan woman and how he rose above his initial misgivings to perform a miracle for her daughter.</p> <p>The pope said: \"One of humanity's great conquests is indeed the overcoming of racism. Unfortunately, however, there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries, often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination.\"</p> <p>Berlusconi's family minister, Giovanardi, denied Benedict's words were aimed at the government. \"The pope has a global perspective\", he said. \"He wasn't talking about Italy.\"</p> <p>Famiglia Cristiana's editor, Father Antonio Sciortino, agreed that the pope \"was certainly speaking to the whole world\". But he added: \"And therefore also to Italy where, sorry to say, there are many signs of racism that trouble us and which cannot be hidden.\"</p> <p>Urged on by his allies in the anti-immigrant Northern League, Berlusconi has ordered a crackdown on crime, and the illegal immigrants his government says is responsible for a disproportionate share of it. </p> <p>Earlier this month, the Berlusconi government ordered troops onto the streets to combat an alleged crime wave it blames largely on illegal immigrants and Roma. Interior ministry figures show that more than a third of the arrests carried out by police last year were of non-Italians.</p> <p>Illegal immigration has been made an offence; mayors have been given new security powers, and deportations have been stepped up. </p> <p>So far, church leaders have been far more outspoken in their criticism of the government's policies than Italy's main, centre-left opposition party. Earlier this month, they succeeded in blocking an attempt by the mayor of Rome to pass a measure - seemingly aimed at Gypsies - that banned people from rummaging in garbage containers.</p> <p>In June, Famiglia Cristiana said a government plan to take the fingerprints of Roma children was \"indecent\".</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336701299\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, today bowed to intense pressure and resigned ahead of impeachment proceedings due to start this week.</p> <p>Musharraf appeared live on national television just after 1pm local time (8am BST) in an address that lasted for over an hour. Towards the finish, as the former army commander put an end to almost nine years in power, his voice trembled and he appeared to have tears in his eyes.</p> <p>\"If I was doing this just for myself, I might have chosen a different course,\" he said, wearing a western suit and tie but speaking in Urdu. \"But I put Pakistan first, as always.</p> <p>\"Whether I win or lose the impeachment, the dignity of the nation would be damaged, the office of the president harmed.\"</p> <p>It is likely that Musharraf stepped down as a part of a western-mediated deal between the president and the coalition government, according to which all charges against him will be dropped in return for his resignation.</p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, said the move marked the end of a \"critical period\" in Pakistan's history and called for quick elections to find a successor.</p> <p>\"The Musharraf years yielded significant dividends\u2026 It is important to highlight President Musharraf's commitment to tackle terrorism, to promote dialogue with India, especially over Kashmir, and to root out corruption,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I look forward to the early election of a new president in Pakistan to take forward the important shared work that binds our two countries together.\"</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, praised Musharraf as a \"friend to the United States and one of the world's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism\".</p> <p>She said the US would work with the new leaders and impress on them the need to stem \"the growth of extremism\".</p> <p>Although it was believed Musharraf resigned as part of a deal to avoid prosecution, it was a humiliation nevertheless for the ex-army chief to have to submit to the very politicians he hated. But he admitted he had been left with no choice.</p> <p>\"Even if I beat this impeachment, relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed,\" he said. \"Pillars of the state \u2013 parliament and the judiciary \u2013 would be harmed and, God forbid, the army might have been dragged in.\" He said he wanted the people to be his judge.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said leaders of the ruling coalition were discussing whether to prosecute Musharraf in court on the impeachment charges.</p> <p>Qureshi would not say whether Musharraf might be granted a safe exit; there has been speculation he might go into exile in Saudi Arabia or Turkey.</p> <p>\"That is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership,\" said Qureshi, a member of the Pakistan People's party (PPP), in a television interview with Dawn News.</p> <p>The Pakistan Muslim League-N, the second-biggest party in the coalition government with the PPP, said Musharraf should be tried for treason, which carries a maximum sentence of death. Its leader, Nawaz Sharif, whom Musharraf deposed as prime minister in a coup in October 1999, was the prime mover behind the impeachment.<br>\"The crimes of Musharraf against the nation, against the judiciary, against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual,\" said the party's spokesman, Ahsan Iqbal.</p> <p>Musharraf, who was a near-absolute ruler until he stepped down as army chief in November last year and held elections this February, did not leave without first launching into an impassioned and lengthy defence of his record. He said the allegations against him were \"lies\".</p> <p>Musharraf laid the blame for Pakistan's economic crisis squarely on the current government, saying that just eight months ago the economy was booming and Pakistan was regarded as one of the next great emerging market success stories.</p> <p>\"When I took over, nine years ago, this country was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state, on the verge of becoming a failed state,\" he said. \"The challenges of the last nine years have been greater than any in Pakistan's history, yet I have met those challenges.\"</p> <p>Celebrations broke out across the country after Musharraf's announcement, with people dancing and handing out sweets. \"Thank God he's resigned. The country will do much better now. It's a victory for the people,\" said Mohammad Ilyas, 30, in Karachi.</p> <p>Lawyers, who have spearheaded an anti-Musharraf campaign since he tried to sack the chief justice last year, stormed out of courts in the south-eastern city of Multan on hearing of his resignation, shouting: \"Down with the American stooge.\" \"It's just like I'm celebrating my wedding,\" said one lawyer, Malik Naveed.</p> <p>It is not yet clear who the next president will be. According to the constitution, the chairman of the senate, Mohammadmian Soomro, will become acting president until a new president is elected within 30 days for a five-year term.</p> <p>Most members of the coalition government did not want to go through the trauma of impeachment proceedings, hoping the threat of prosecution would be enough to persuade the president to go. Musharraf held out for almost two weeks after the announcement that the government had decided to impeach him.</p> <p>Reza Rabbani, a leading PPP member, said: \"This is the first time in Pakistan's political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Turvey scored a double victory at Silverstone on Saturday, propelling himself into the lead of the British formula three championship with just four races to go.</p> <p>The Briton, who was last week awarded the first-ever Cambridge blue for motor sport, claimed the win in race one despite a poor getaway from pole-position. He was usurped by Carlin Motorsport team-mate and front row sitter Brendon Hartley, who later made a mistake that gave Turvey the opportunity to pass into the lead. The pair crossed the line in that order, with Fortec's Marcus Ericsson finishing third.</p> <p>The roles were reversed in race two, when it was Hartley who made a sticky start from pole and Turvey shot into a lead he would not concede. Hartley failed to repeat his earlier podium, tumbling down the order to finish in ninth position, allowing Ericsson to claim second with Nick Tandy in third.</p> <p>It was the first double victory for Turvey in the formula three series, having narrowly missed out at the recent Spa round, where he won one race but suffered an engine failure while preparing to start the second from pole position. Coupled with lacklustre performances from title rivals Sergio Perez and Jaime Alguersuari, his Silverstone performance means that Turvey, 21, now has a nine-point lead as the teams prepare to head to Romania for the Bucharest street race this weekend.</p> <p>\"It's been an almost perfect weekend,\" said Turvey. \"We came here with a good car and found a good set up straight away. Carlin and my mechanics have done a great job so I have to thank them. To win both races here makes up for the disappointment of the second race at Spa. Brendon is usually very quick at the start so I'm not sure what happened to him. All I know is that I was into the first corner first and was able to control the race from there. Hopefully we can hold on to the championship lead for the last few races and win the championship in my first year.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\">President Musharraf's departure</a> from the political stage is a victory for the people of Pakistan. There are few times that the colluders and collaborators who helped run the shadowy establishment in Pakistan are prepared to slink away quietly leaving democrats in charge. Yet Musharraf has decided to do just that \u2013 and the world is unlikely to thank him.<br> Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan2\">nine years</a> of Musharraf's \"enlightened moderation\" Pakistan has not been transformed. His alliance with the United States might have suited Washington but it enraged and radicalised large sections of Pakistani society. In a poll earlier this year a third of Pakistanis said they had a positive view of al-Qaida \u2013 twice as many as those who responded positively about the United States. Half of the people questioned believed the United States was the country's \"greatest threat\".</p> <p>There's little doubt that Islamic militancy in Pakistan has spread during Musharraf's time in power. This has left a military that is unable to control generation of Islamic militants and an intelligence agency with an even greater appetite to control domestic politics. But such things are a minority pursuit. The real problems begin with the ideas \u2013 those of victimhood and overt militarism \u2013 used to glue Pakistan together.</p> <p>This failure cannot be laid entirely at Musharraf's door. It goes back much further than him. Pakistan has for too long been an ideological state rather than a functional one. This has left a terrible legacy on the psyche of its people.<br> I have often been shocked when educated, otherwise seemingly intelligent Pakistani officals tell me in private that it was the Jews who bombed the Twin Towers or make the case for suicide bombings saying it is justified if Muslims were fighting for the return of their historical lands. True, these are snippets of conversations, but they will be familiar to anybody who has spent time in the country.</p> <p>In many ways the civil rights groups, the politicians, the lawyers and the democrats in Pakistan have been fighting to reverse the tide. That is why so many of them initially welcomed Musharraf's coup in 1999. They were fed up of the messy, corrupt, sectarian indigenous politics which seemed to be eating away at the country. They saw in Pervez Musharraf a kindred spirit.</p> <p>But Musharraf ultimately failed in trying to promote a new kind of Pakistani nationalism. He saw that Pakistan had been created in a rush and spent time looking at how to rebuild the state. He wanted ordinary Pakistanis to see themselves as part of a second wave of coming economic powerhouses. He said as much in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/18/musharraf\">emotional resignation speech</a>. But the promise of a better tomorrow never satisfied Pakistanis who saw their rights curbed and their fellow citizens bombed and jailed in service of a \"foreign\" cause.<br> Instead of creating a new country, Musharraf's deals with foreign friends accentuated the country's problems. Washington has given Pakistan more than $10bn since the September 2001 attacks yet the economy is in free-fall with inflation rampant and blackouts in the nation's capital. Pakistan has turned once again to Saudi Arabia \u2013 to wipe out billions of dollars it owes for oil purchases this year. It's clear the country's treasury is empty. There is precious little international goodwill. The new government should not celebrate too soon the victory over Musharraf. It will soon be fighting with its back to the wall.</p>",
  "<h2>General Ashfaq Kayani</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336709185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/kayanipic140.jpg\" alt=\"Ashfaq Kayani\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashfaq Kayani</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kayani was perceived as a close Musharraf ally when he was appointed last November. However, as Musharraf's popularity fell, Kayani pulled the army back from politics, ordering soldiers to steer clear of politicians and withdrawing senior officers from sinecures - patronage jobs - in civilian institutions. In the February general elections, Kayani warned Musharraf against any attempt at manipulation in a further sign that the army had abandoned the former head of the army to his fate.</p> <p>Given the importance of the army in Pakistan, Kayani can be expected to be one the country's most influential figures, courted by the US for its \"war on terror\" in the largely lawless border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and by Pakistan's politicians to ensure that the army stays in the barracks and does not stage another coup.</p> <h2>Nawaz Sharif</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336709186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/sharifpic140.jpg\" alt=\"Nawaz Sharif\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nawaz Sharif</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sharif tried to return to Pakistan from exile in September but was kicked out after a few hours, an episode that burnished his democratic credentials. Sharif, who leads Pakistan's second-biggest party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, served as finance minister and chief minister under General Zia-ul-Haq during martial law. He was deposed as prime minister by Musharraf in 1999 because of the military's unhappiness with his decision to withdraw Pakistani-backed forces from the Indian side of the line of control in disputed Kashmir.</p> <p>Like Benazir Bhutto, Sharif twice served as prime minister, and like her he has been tainted by charges of corruption. Although an outspoken advocate of democracy today, Sharif did not shy away from strongarm measures when he was in power. In his second term, he undermined MPs by forcing through a constitutional amendment that required all national assembly members to vote along party lines. He tried to intimidate the press by ordering tax investigations into certain editors, and his supporters ransacked the supreme court building when it tried to hear a case in which he was a defendant.</p> <h2>Asif Zardari</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336709187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/zardaripic140.jpg\" alt=\"Asif Zardari\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asif Zardari</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zardari took over the leadership of the Pakistan People's party (PPP) after the assassination of his wife, Benazir Bhutto, last December. For months, he and Sharif plotted to impeach Musharraf. Zardari was widely known as \"Mr 10%\" during Bhutto's first time as prime minister, amid allegations of receiving backhanders. By the second term, he was known as \"Mr 20%\" as inflation took hold.</p> <p>In his second term as prime minister, Sharif ordered an investigation into allegations the Bhuttos took millions of dollars in kickbacks involving a contract to improve the collection of customs duties. A Geneva magistrate said he found Swiss bank accounts in the name of offshore Virgin Island companies that were in fact controlled by Zardari. In their first five months in office, the PPP and the PML-N coalition passed the national reconciliation ordinance, a law that wipes out 15 years' worth of corruption cases against politicians, including 11 years during PPP and PML rule.</p> <h2>Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336709188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/chaudhry140.jpg\" alt=\"Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Musharraf's downward slide began when he tried to sack Pakistan's chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, in March last year. Described by Musharraf as \"the scum of the earth\", Chaudhry had emerged as a major thorn in the former president's side, opposing him on several occasions. In one standoff the supreme court rejected the deportation of the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was expelled when he tried to return last September.</p> <p>The chief justice took up cases of \"forced disappearances\" - people believed to have been picked up by the country's powerful intelligence agencies without due legal process. Commentators said Chaudhry, who has been under house arrest since last November, had become an outright threat to the government because he had begun to take the constitutional guarantee of judicial independence too seriously and was poking his nose into delicate government business. Chaudhry remained defiant during his period of house arrest, urging Pakistan's lawyers to stand up to Musharraf.</p>",
  "<p><em>Bi Feiyu is one of the most respected authors and screenwriters in China today. He was born in 1964 in Xinghua, in the province of Jiangsu, China. He co-wrote the film Shanghai Triad, which was directed by Zhang Yimou.</em></p> <p><em>His new novel, Three Sisters, portrays three sisters struggling to change the course of their destinies in a China that does not belong to them. Yumi uses her dignity, Yuxiu her seductive powers, and Yuyang her desire for success in a shared refusal to dissolve into collective anonymity.</em></p> <p><em>In this exclusive extract from Howard Goldblatt's translation, the village Party Secretary's oldest daughter, Yumi, meets her future husband, Peng Guoliang, for the first time</em></p> <p>The arrival of Yumi brought the story to a climax. After the women had taken <br>her brother away from her they opened a path to her home and dragged her along it. This was a scene they had been awaiting for a long time, and once it had been acted out they would all breathe easier. So they walked her home, one step at a time; she didn't have to do anything but lean back and let the others do all the work. When she reached the gate her courage abandoned her and she refused to take another step. A couple of the bolder young maidens pushed her up until she was standing right in front of Peng Guoliang. </p> <p>The crowd thought he might actually salute her, but he didn't. Nor did he snap to attention. He was, in fact, barely able to stand, as he just kept opening and closing his mouth. When Yumi sneaked a look at him, the expression on his face put her at ease, though she was fidgeting bashfully. Beet-red cheeks made her eyes seem darker than ever, sparkling as they tried to hide from view. To the villagers outside the door she was a pitiful sight; they could hardly believe that the bashful girl they were looking at was actually Yumi. In the end, it seemed, she was just a girl. So, with a few lusty shouts from the crowd, the climax passed and the tense mood dissipated. Of course they were happy for Peng Guoliang, but it was Yumi who was really on their minds.</p> <p>Wang Lianfang walked out to treat the men in the crowd to cigarettes and even offered one to the son of Zhang Rujun, who was cradled in his mother's arms, looking foolish as only a baby boy can. Wang tucked the cigarette behind the boy's ear. </p> <p>'Take it home and give it to your daddy,' he said. </p> <p>They'd never seen him be so polite, though clearly that was meant as a joke. A chorus of laughter made for a delightful atmosphere before Wang shooed the crowd away and, with a sigh of relief, shut the door behind them.</p> <p>Shi Guifang sent Peng Guoliang and Yumi into the kitchen to boil some water. As an experienced housewife, she knew the importance of a kitchen to a young couple. First meetings always turned out the same, with a pair of shy and unfamiliar youngsters seated behind the stove, one pumping the bellows while the other added firewood, until the heat turned their faces red and slowly loosened them up. So Guifang opened the kitchen door and told Yuying and Yuxiu to go somewhere else. The last thing she wanted was for the other girls to hang around the house. Except for Yumi, not one of her daughters knew how to behave around people.</p> <p>While Yumi was lighting a fire, Peng Guoliang gave her a second gift. The first, in accordance with an age-old custom, had to be a bolt of fabric, some knitting yarn, or something along those lines. By coming with a second set of gifts, he showed himself to be different from others. He gave her a red-barrelled Hero-brand fountain pen and a bottle of Hero-brand blue-black ink, a pad of forty-weight letter paper, twenty-five envelopes, and a Chairman Mao pin that glowed in the dark. There was a hint of intimacy attached to all the gifts, each of which, at the same time, represented a cultured and progressive spirit. He placed them all on top of the bellows, beside which he had laid his army cap, with a star that shone bright and deep red. With all these items arrayed on the bellows, silence spoke more loudly than words. Peng Guoliang worked the bellows, each forceful squeeze heating up the fire in the stove. Flames rose into the air, like powerful pillars, moving from side to side each time he brought his hands together. For her part, Yumi added rice straw to the pillars of fire, moving in concert with him, as if by design, and creating a moving tableau. When the straw fell from the fire tongs onto the flames, it first leaped into the air, then wilted and turned transparent before finally regaining colour and creating both heat and light. The two stove tenders' faces and chests reddened rhythmically from the flames; their breathing and the rising and falling of their chests, too, had a rhythmic quality, though both required adjustments and extra control. The air was so hot and in constant oscillation it was as if a private sun hung above each of their heads, all but baking them, in jubilant fashion, a sort of heated tenderness. Their emotions were in chaos, rising and falling in their breasts. There was confusion, at least a little, and something in the air that could easily have led to tears, here one moment and then gone the next. Yumi knew she was in love, and as she gazed into the fire, she couldn't stop the flow of warm tears. Peng Guoliang noticed, but said nothing. Taking out his handkerchief, he laid it on Yumi's knee. But instead of using it to dry her tears, she held it up to her nose. It smelled faintly of bath soap, and nearly made her cry out loud. She managed to hold back, but that only increased the flow of tears. Up to that moment they hadn't exchanged a single word and hadn't touched one another, not even a finger. That suited Yumi perfectly. This is what love is supposed to be, she told herself, quietly sitting close but not touching, somewhat remote but in silent harmony. Close at hand, though longing in earnest and calling to mind some distant place. As it should be.</p> <p>Yumi's glance fell on Peng Guoliang's foot, which she could see was a size 42. No question about it. She already knew his sizes, all of them. When a girl falls for a boy, her eyes become measuring tape. Her gaze stretches out to take a measurement, then, when that's done, snaps right back.<br>Custom dictated that Peng Guoliang not stay under the same roof before Yumi became his wife. But Wang Lianfang was in the habit of breaking rules and dedicated to transforming social traditions. </p> <p>'You'll stay here,' he announced.</p> <p>He took great pleasure in seeing Peng Guoliang walk in and out of the yard; his presence created an aura of power around the house and brought him high honour. </p> <p>'It's not proper,' Shi Guifang said softly. </p> <p>Wang Lianfang glared at her and said sternly, 'That's metaphysical nonsense.'</p> <p>So Peng Guoliang took up residence in the Wang home and stayed put. When he wasn't eating or sleeping, he spent his time behind the stove with Yumi. What a wonderful spot that was. A sacred spot for village lovers. He and Yumi were talking by this time, though the strain on her was considerable, since words in the national dialect, <em>putonghua</em>, kept cropping up in his speech. She loved the way it sounded, even if she hadn't mastered it, because those few added words conjured up distant places, a whole different world, and were made for talk between lovers. On this particular evening the fire in the belly of the stove slowly died out and darkness crept over them, frightening her. But this sense of fright was augmented with complicated feelings of hope and anxiety. Budding love is cloaked in darkness, since there is no road map to show where it's headed; neither partner knows how or where to start, and that usually makes for awkward situations. They maintained a respectful distance out of fear of touching, absorbed in feelings of anxiety.</p> <p>Peng Guoliang reached out and took Yumi's hand. At last, they were <em>holding hands</em>. Admittedly, she was a little scared, but this was what she'd been waiting for. Letting Guoliang <em>hold</em> her hand instilled in her the satisfaction of a job well done, and a sigh of relief emanated from the depths of her heart. Strictly speaking, she was not holding his hand; her hand was caught in his. At first his fingers were stiff and unbending, but slowly they came to life, and when that happened they turned wilful, sliding in between hers, only to back out, unhappily, seemingly in failure. But back they came. The movements of his hand were so new to Yumi that she had trouble breathing. Then without warning, he put his arms around her and covered her lips with his.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an exclusive edited extract from the first translation of Three Sisters, due to be published by Telegram in early 2009, price \u00a38.99</p>",

  "<p>Terry Gilliam doesn't have much luck. The British film-maker whose <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_in_La_Mancha\">attempted Don Quixote biopic</a> fell foul of noisy military fighter jets, flash floods and injuries to his lead actor is now facing a struggle to secure a distribution deal for his new film despite the fact that it features <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i999ebd327d1b0f720259119e360f8d44?imw=Y\">Heath Ledger's last ever performance</a>.</p> <p>Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus features the late Dark Knight star as a character who travels through a magical mirror into a realm beyond reality to rescue a kidnapped young woman. Ledger's death from an accidental overdose in New York in January left the production in tatters, but Gilliam received a huge boost when Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law agreed to join the cast as replacements. The screenplay was rejigged to allow Ledger's character to change appearance as he enters different areas of the mirror world, with the arrival of the three new actors attracting positive press coverage.</p> <p>US distributors, however, apparently remain unconvinced. Film industry bible The Hollywood Reporter says Gilliam's new feature is struggling to overcome the perception of him as a maverick film-maker who hasn't had a box office hit since 1995's Twelve Monkeys.</p> <p>\"In this market, unless I have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk I'm not going to take a flyer on it, even with Heath Ledger,\" one distribution executive told the Reporter. Another industry \"insider\" commented: \"For all the elements in this film, it is a Terry Gilliam picture, and as much as you want a movie of his to be good, you have to be careful.\"</p> <p>Depp, Farrell and Law are donating their fees to Ledger's family. The shoot moved from the UK to Vancouver in order for the new actors to film their parts.</p> <p>The film also features Christopher Plummer, Tom Waits and Lily Cole. Plummer plays the titular Dr Parnassus, the leader of a travelling theatre troupe that offers audience members a chance to go beyond reality through a magical mirror. Waits stars as the Devil, who arrives to steal away Parnassus's daughter (Cole).</p>",
  "<p>Carl Edwards beat Sprint Cup leader Kyle Busch to victory at Michigan to claim his second win of the weekend.</p> <p>The Roush Fenway driver won Friday's Nationwide encounter at the speedway and went on to secure the Sprint Cup victory over Busch by mastering a restart with two laps to go. Edwards, claiming his fifth win of the season, made sure he was in control by exiting the pits ahead of Busch in the final pitstop.</p> <p>\"We're getting to the point I feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to,\" said Edwards. \"Our pit crew has stepped up their game. That was our weakness for a long time, and the guys have just repeatedly, week after week, worked harder and become better. My psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on I'm the greatest race car driver to ever live. You know what I'm saying? If you don't believe that, you don't belong in the race car.\"</p> <p>Busch came home in second place, in front of David Ragan who recorded his best-ever Nascar Sprint Cup finish in third. \"It just came down to when he beat us off pit road,\" said Busch, who had lead Edwards at one point during the race. \"That was it for us. We weren't able to get through the corners as fast as Carl was.\"</p> <p>The win helped Edwards gain bonus points ahead of the Chase for the Cup, while Busch, as predicted, became the first driver to claim a place in the Chase.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/15/libraries.fines\">An argument has blown up among librarians over the past week over fines</a>. Those in the anti-fine camp believe that they are putting readers off libraries, while those on the other side of the fence are asking why people would return their books to libraries on time without the threat of a fine. Below, we hear from both sides of the debate.</p> <p><strong>Frances Hendrix is a library consultant and is against library fines. She writes:</strong></p> <p>\"Why on earth are public libraries charging any fines at all for books not in very heavy demand? What is the purpose of a fine and what does it do for customer relationships?</p> <p>It seems that monies from fines are treated by the local authority as a valid income stream to help run the library. How on earth did public libraries get themselves into this mess? In most cases it appears that if the same borrower renews a book, then statistically it is counted as a new loan by a new borrower, hence an artificial increase in loans and borrowers, which in turn helps libraries demonstrate demand. Whilst it is vitally important to increase the use and the profile of libraries, staff could certainly be put to much better use than chasing and counting fines. Some libraries have a policy of not charging fines to certain categories of people, so when next returning your overdue book, try to look ill, or down and out.</p> <p>The other main point being made by librarians is that money raised by charging fines is all \"profit\" (not a term one expects to see in relation to pubic libraries), but no one seems to have been able to demonstrate whether fine income produces a surplus over the cost of labour and materials involved, and certainly there has been little if any attempt to collect evidence, check with borrowers as to the attitude towards fines or the effect upon customer satisfaction of a fines regime.</p> <p>Public libraries are a national institution, vital to a civilised society. The first libraries were set up by benefactors who had the vision and ethos of literacy, for all, for free. Local authorities are not so sure, which is why despite all of us paying for libraries through rates and taxation they still see them as an easy target when balancing budgets. Fines do not fix the deficit. Public libraries need to be destinations of choice, and nothing should be done to further deter those who use them.</p> <p><strong>Sue Williamson works for Cambridgeshire Libraries and is in favour of fines. She stresses that the opinion below is entirely her own, and in no way represents the views of Cambridgeshire Library Service or Cambridgeshire County Council.</strong></p> <p>As a relatively recent library professional (a mere 10 years) and a much longer user of libraries, I would like to put the case for continuing with library fines.</p> <p>When a customer borrows something from a public library, they enter into a contract with the service to look after the item while it is in their possession and return it at a specified time. These are the terms and conditions under which the service operates and are clearly stated at the outset. Yes, everybody has paid for that service, but that means that they have paid for the building costs, the stock and staffing costs and all the other hidden costs that are at issue in providing a public service. It does not mean that they can fail to abide by the initial contract.</p> <p>Public libraries are a community resource and as such everybody has a right to use them. This means that we need to try and provide equal access to all our resources and if customers do not return their items on time, this deprives other users of that resource. In a recent professional forum, this argument was expanded to make a plea for one of the few remaining bastions of social responsibility: there are very few areas where people are contracted to do something in this way and we could see ourselves in libraries as guardians of socially appropriate behaviour.</p> <p>Furthermore, the argument that the cost of books has come down, while true of universally popular material, is not true of the more specialist items that libraries also provide. In addition the daily costs of housing our collections, staffing libraries and maintaining an excellent public service have risen dramatically.</p> <p>Also, in the service in which I work, we make it very easy to avoid fines. Customers with e-mail addresses are sent a notification that their books are about to become overdue a few days before the fact and all have the options to renew in person, by automated phone renewal (24-hour service), online and by text messaging. This rather negates the argument that people are too busy to return books on time.</p> <p>However, I would issue one caveat: I do think that it is important that staff should be well trained in how to deal with this delicate issue. No customer should ever feel judged or blamed when asked to pay a fine and all staff should be flexible and adaptable in the case of extenuating circumstances.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last Thursday an employment tribunal sitting in Southampton handed down a judgment which is likely to have profound implications for the manner in which British universities underpin academic standards. The tribunal found that the resignation of a teacher at Bournemouth University amounted to unfair dismissal, because that resignation had been triggered by the deliberate undermining of his academic authority in relation to the university's assessment process; such undermining, the tribunal concluded, was so serious as to amount to a repudiatory breach of his contract.</p> <p>The academic in question is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-446069/A-degree-dishonesty.html\">Dr Paul Buckland</a>, an eminent professor of environmental archaeology. In the summer of 2006 Buckland set and graded an examination paper in the normal way. Some 18 students were failed. A resit examination took place on August 29. Again, the papers were graded in the normal way, first by Buckland and then (as is customary) by a second internal examiner. Of 16 candidates 14 were deemed to have failed the resit. On September 7 a properly constituted board of examiners, chaired by Dr Brian Astin, a pro vice-chancellor of the university, \"checked and confirmed\" the marks.</p> <p>So far so good. Out of a total of about 60 students, 14 \u2013 almost a quarter \u2013 had been failed. No academic relishes failing students. On the other hand, academic standards must be paramount. And Buckland, and his co-examiner, were determined that they should be. But elsewhere in the university a different view was being taken. Dr Miles Russell, programme leader for the archaeology BSc degree, \"intermeddled in the exam marking process\" (to use the exact words of the employment tribunal's judgment). He (again I use the tribunal's exact words) \"took possession of the resit exam papers and remarked them\". At paragraph 98 of its report the tribunal pulls no punches: \"Dr Russell should not have done what he did; he simply had no business intermeddling in the marking \u2026 \" What is more, this remarking did not have the prior sanction of Astin, chair of the board of examiners. Nonetheless the secretary to the board appears to have arranged for the scripts, as regraded by Dr Russell, to be scrutinised by a second academic. Although initially acquiescing in this strange procedure, Buckland subsequently objected in the strongest possible terms, pointing out \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the proper way of proceeding would have been to refer the scripts to the relevant external examiner.</p> <p>But the externals were not further involved. Instead, as a result of the strange remarking exercise, a number of students were moved from a straight fail to a borderline position, permitting them to be deemed to have passed if marks for other subjects were high enough. The net result was that students whom professor Buckland and his co-examiner had failed, and whose failures had been endorsed first by the external examiner and then by the board of examiners, were told that they had passed. </p> <p>Although a subsequent internal inquiry gave a great deal of support to professor Buckland's bitter protests, the marks were allowed to stand. Early in 2007 he took what in my view was the only honourable course open to him. He resigned. And the employment tribunal has now concluded that, taking into account the decision of Dr Astin to endorse by chair's action the results of the strange remarking process, the university is guilty of a repudiatory breach of its contract with professor Buckland. </p> <p>The report of the employment tribunal offers a rare and fascinating public insight into the generally secretive world of university boards of examiners and examination processes. Save in the case of professionally-accredited degrees (such as medicine or law), universities are answerable to no one for the standards of their awards. They alone set the exams and they alone grade them. These processes, it is true, invariably involve external examiners \u2013 generally subject-specialists from other universities \u2013 but evidence I presented in my University of Buckingham <a href=\"http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2008/alderman.html\">inaugural lecture</a> in June suggested that the external-examiner system has in many respects broken down. In the Bournemouth case considered by the employment tribunal last week the system was simply bypassed. </p> <p>Following my lecture, the Commons' select committee on universities summoned the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.qaa.ac.uk/news/media/pressReleases/17_July_2008.asp\">Quality Assurance Agency</a>, Peter Williams, and his management team, and quizzed them about multiple failures in the mechanisms allegedly in place to assure standards in our universities. The chairman of the select committee, Lib Dem MP Phil Willis, told Peter Williams that the degree classification system was \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7511601.stm\">descending into farce</a>\". What else could Williams do but agree? Williams remained adamant that the British higher-education system was still \"robust, solid and good\". But this sweeping assertion ignored the implications of his own evidence. It isn't only the degree-classification system that is past the end of its shelf-life. So \u2013 on his own evidence \u2013 is the current external-examiner regime. </p> <p>Two things now need to happen. The first is that as soon as parliament reconvenes Williams, accompanied (I would suggest) by the chief executive of Universities UK, Baroness Diana Warwick, need to be brought before the select committee to explain how they propose to remedy the deficiencies highlighted by the committee on July 17, and since dramatically underlined by the Bournemouth case.</p> <p>The second concerns Buckland. Whilst those responsible for the fiasco at Bournemouth remain in post, he is unemployed. In some Wessex circles Buckland may be regarded as an awkward customer. Perhaps. But he is also an outstanding academic, fearless in his defence of standards and of the integrity of the examination process. Is it too much \u2013 I wonder \u2013 to expect Bournemouth University to do the decent thing and invite him back?</p>",
  "<p>Katherine Grainger stood outside the white hut in which the press conference was being held. She, and the three other women in her boat, had arrived late, anticipating perhaps that Chinese interest in their own gold-winning crew would mean there would be little time or space for anyone else.

This was just 20 minutes after she had been presented with her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.rowing\">third straight Olympic silver</a>, confirming her status as the most successful female rower her country has ever produced.</p> <p>Having done this many times before, the autopilot operating Grainger's brain knew just what she should tell the hungry hacks.

Then her parents arrived, and Grainger burst into tears, collapsing into the arms of her mother. They embraced for many minutes, the daughter crying on to her mother's shoulder.</p> <p>It was one of the hardest things I've watched since I've been in this line of work. This was, should have been, one of the finest moments of her life, and she was inconsolably distraught. The press pack, so tightly cordoned around her before, dissipated. The tabloid men shuffled their feet and stared at the floor; others, like myself, turned and left altogether. This did not seem to be something anyone should witness except the Graingers themselves, a distinctly private moment.</p> <p>For all the joyful celebration you see at the Games, there seem to be just as many tears. Sadness and sorrow are inextricably woven through what goes on here.</p> <p>Last week it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/14/olympicgames.badminton\">Gail Emms</a>, sobbing in the minutes after the final match of her badminton career, her explosively chemical partnership with the dashing Nathan Robertson having just come to an end in the quarter-finals. I stood in the mixed zone with dozens of others, feeling rotten as I thrust my mic under her nose as though it was a bouquet of flowers.</p> <p>On Sunday it was <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/heroic_radcliffe_learns_from_w.html\">Paula Radcliffe</a> and, as well as Grainger, the other three members of her silver-winning women's quad. And this morning, just a few hours ago, it was Sun Haiping, coach of <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/hopes_of_a_nation_dashed_as_ch.html\">Liu Xiang</a>. During the hastily arranged press conference after Xiang's sorry limp away from the hurdles track, Haiping uttered what he could about the injury. Asked how \"he felt personally about this injury to an athlete with whom he has a father-son-like relationship\" Haiping garbled one line of speech then yelped and broke down. The Chinese media officer sat alongside and, somewhat put out, he soon handed Haiping a handkerchief. The press were asked not to mention the topic again. Haiping stared at the table in silence, trying to check his emotions, until he was able to get up and leave.</p> <p>The tears are one of the most emotive things about covering these Games. Reflecting afterwards, I couldn't think why I was so surprised by the crying. When you think of Olympics gone by, it's easy to summon up images of other athlete's tears, with Derek Redmond coming immediately to mind.</p> <p>But then the people who play the sports I spend most of the year watching \u2013 cricket and rugby \u2013 just don't do it very much. The captain of the Australian cricket team, Kim Hughes, did once at his resignation press conference, and the backlash was so severe that it helped kick-start the last 25 years of Australian success. Allan Border, all moustache and machismo, was appointed his replacement and brought a new spirit of toughness to the team. Ever since, memories of Hughes's elegant batting are invariably second to those of him sobbing.</p> <p>Rugby players only cry at the start of matches, when they're singing the national anthem. Footballers are a little more forthcoming, as the England team, slumped in the centre circle, showed after losing to Portugal on penalties in the World Cup.</p> <p>And of course there's Gazza. That moment, so significant in establishing the wider popularity that made the Premier League the success it is, may just be responsible for the increase in occasions when you do see footballers sob. Some of you readers will know better than I whether footballers used to cry in pre-Premiership days. I'm sure there are examples, but I suspect that it's one of those things, like pasta, mineral water and billionaires that just wasn't so prevalent in the way the game used to be. Maybe it's because they work harder at it in modern days.</p> <p>It's got nothing to do with one sport being more or less prone to machismo than another: you'd struggle to say rowing was any softer than rugby as a sport. In fact, the brutal endurance-based nature of it stimulates the rush of suppressed emotions that well up when the finish line is crossed.</p> <p>The amount of tears being shed at the Olympic Games is an explanation of why they are so uniquely engrossing. For the majority of the athletes competing, the four years and more of single-minded devotion to their sport brings few great rewards. There aren't many huge wages, most don't get to live in mansions and often they'll struggle even to pay their mortgages. If they're not funded through grants then they've had to sacrifice parts of their normal lives, their careers and relationships to train to compete here. If they are full-time athletes then their goal is even clearer, and they have even fewer excuses for not reaching it.</p> <p>Either way, the only carrot on the stick is the prospect of appearing at the Games and, if they're good enough, winning a medal. That is the single thought that both sustains and consumes many competitors. It is the amount that the athletes have at stake on their performances that makes Olympic sport so significant and compelling. And also, at times, so upsetting.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly a quarter of teachers are worried about hidden surveillance cameras in their schools, according to research published today.</p> <p>In a survey of 249 primary and secondary teachers in state and private schools across the UK nearly 10% say CCTV is operating in toilets, and almost a quarter worry that hidden cameras have been installed within the building.</p> <p>The survey, conducted by the Association of Teachers and Lectures (ATL), found that most of the CCTV cameras in schools cover the grounds and entrances to building, although 85% of schools have CCTV in their buildings.</p> <p>While more than half of teachers (52.9%) say they feel safer as a result of CCTV, the general consensus from the survey was that classroom surveillance is an invasion of privacy, disrupts education and leads to teachers feeling constantly watched and judged.<br> An ATL working group is looking into the use of CCTV in schools and colleges and will produce best practice guidance at the end of the year.</p> <p>According to the survey, 97.6% of teachers feel CCTV is primarily used for security and monitoring vandalism around the building.</p> <p>However, half of the teachers reported that the surveillance is also present inside the school to monitor the behaviour of the pupils within school hours.</p> <p>Some 16% said it was used for controlling student behaviour, while 10.4% said CCTV was used to control truancy and 72.6% said it was used to monitor and control vandalism.</p> <p>Teachers are concerned that regular use of cameras in class would be intimidating, ATL found. But 42.3% thought that streaming CCTV footage over the internet for controlled groups such as parents was a \"useful development only to be used in limited circumstances\".</p> <p>Most teachers questioned believed that CCTV made them safer at school and 60.7% of teachers said CCTV could have positive uses, such as reducing the level of abuse against staff and students.</p> <p>Tonia Matthews, a teacher at Trinity secondary school in west Berkshire, said: \"Students feel secure to know that if there has been an incident, ie bullying, we can then go back and look what happened.\"</p> <p>Elaine Brown, from Portchester secondary school in Bournemouth, said the use of CCTV had \"helped to reduce bullying considerably\".</p> <p>However, more than half of the teachers involved in the survey thought the presence of CCTV cameras would not result in students behaving any differently.</p> <p>And nearly two-thirds of teachers surveyed did not know what security measures their school has for use of CCTV within their schools, and are not sure about the policies for restricting the use of surveillance data.</p> <p>Louise Davies, a teacher from a secondary school in Brighton, said: \"Where there is not a high level of trust, staff may have concerns that evidence may be gathered against them.\"</p> <p>Mary Bousted, ATL's general secretary, said: \"No one really knows enough about the use of CCTV in schools \u2013 it's a very new issue.</p> <p>\"Certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of CCTV in schools, and strict safeguards for its use.</p> <p>\"Although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes, such as discouraging vandalism and violence, we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Election Commission (FEC) is being urged to investigate whether Wal-Mart broke the law by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/11/us.union\">holding mandatory meetings for employees</a> where Democratic legislative proposals were attacked.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/\">American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO)</a> - which represents over 50 unions - the Change to Win labour group, American Rights at Work - a worker advocacy group - and <a href=\"http://www.WakeUpWalMart.com\">WakeUpWalMart.com</a> have together filed a complaint with the FEC.</p> <p>The quartet claim Wal-Mart broke the law by disparaging the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), a law that will almost certainly be enacted if Senator Barack Obama is elected president. The law makes it easier for workers to organise a union, a situation that Wal-Mart vehemently opposes, and which Republicans are also against.</p> <p>\"If an employer can manipulate or intimidate its employees into voting one way or another, it seriously undermines political democracy,\" Stewart Acuff, a spokesperson for the AFL-CIO, told theguardian.com.</p> <p>It is a violation of federal election law for an employer to try to manipulate its employees' votes. Wal-Mart has denied the allegations and analysis shows that in this election cycle its political action committee has split donations almost evenly between the parties.</p> <p>Wal-Mart spokesman David Tovar said that if anyone representing the company \"gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote, they were wrong and acting without approval\".</p> <p>\"We believe that if the FEC looks into this, they will find what we've known all along, that we did nothing wrong,\" Tovar said in an e-mailed statement to AP.</p> <p>The EFCA will allow workers to join or form a union as easily as the employer can join the chamber of commerce - simply by signing a card or petition. And when more than 50% of workers have signed up, the union is established. Currently, secret ballots are used.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal has said it has received <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121867433681738991.html?mod=sphere_ts&amp;mod=sphere_wd\">a recording of a Wal-Mart meeting</a> where the company tells employees that their wages may be reduced to minimum wage for up to three months before a contract is negotiated; that union authorisation cards violate workers' right to privacy by including their social security numbers on them; and that if a small unit within a store voted to unionise, the entire store would be unionised.</p> <p>Lawyers told the newspaper that those are inaccurate interpretations of US labour laws in general and the EFCA in particular, and could be interpreted as a violation of labour law.</p>",
  "<p>After indicating they were willing to support Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's exit, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/USA/US_fights_for_safe_passage_to_Musharraf/articleshow/3362841.cms\">US officials</a> are now being forced to contemplate something which they had previously viewed as unthinkable: a Pakistan without their trusted general at its helm. Even the Pakistani military signaled they were no longer willing to support Musharraf, leaving the embattled leader with very few friends. </p> <p>The question everyone was asking was: how long will he last? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/pakistan.usa\">Tariq Ali</a>, writing on Comment is free last week, gave Musharraf only days in office. Now we know: the General <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/18/pakistan\">has resigned</a>, rather than face the threat of an unprecedented impeachment from Pakistan's parliament. </p> <p>This leaves the United States and its western allies like Britain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/17/pakistan\">in a difficult position</a>. The US \u2013 as it has done so many times \u2013 put all its eggs in one basket in the military ruler Musharraf, and perceptions of the US have plummeted along with Musharraf's career. An overwhelming percentage of Pakistanis are opposed to Musharraf's war against militants in Pakistan's tribal areas, seeing it as an unnecessary American intervention that has made Pakistan less secure. The US must understand that in voting to impeach Musharraf, Pakistanis wanted to vote against the US and the way it is conducting its \"war on terror\" in Pakistan. </p> <p>Prominent Pakistani government figures, including PML chairman Nawaz Sharif, PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, have pushed for a new approach to Pakistan's tribal areas which focuses more on dialogue instead of Musharraf's bombardments which radicalised the tribes and led to a perception that their religion, culture, and ethnicity were under attack. </p> <p>The departure of Musharraf is a strong indication that the US needs to change course quickly in its \"war on terror\" in the region, a change demanded by Pakistan's population. Pakistan is America's major non-Nato ally, but its population is drifting further and further from the US. If the US does not shift to a more culturally nuanced, efficient policy in the tribal areas that balances the threat of force with efforts to reach out to the tribes and understand their position, it will be in danger of continuing to promote Musharraf, even now that he has gone, by perpetuating the discredited policies that characterised his rule. This will have a disastrous effect on US-Pakistan relations and will also serve to swing the pendulum further towards religious conservatives who preach that Islam is under attack from the US. </p> <p>In the face of Musharraf's exit, I am left thinking of what might have been. I had the opportunity to spend an hour with Musharraf in Rawalpindi as a part of a research trip I took around the Muslim world for the book <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/events/2007/0613islamic-world.aspx\">Journey into Islam: The Crisis of Globalization</a> by Akbar Ahmed (Brookings Press: 2007). The Musharraf I met was warm, engaged, and possessed a genuine sense of humour. He spoke passionately about Pakistan and also Islam, especially the moving experience he had taking the haj to Saudi Arabia. He spoke of the need to balance Islamic religion and culture with the opportunities offered by the west, and said that it was possible to be both Muslim and modern without being western. He also, curiously, spoke of his admiration for Napoleon Bonaparte in a discussion about history; I think he may have seen himself as a patriotic military leader who sought to implement religious freedom and other reforms through the military. </p> <p>Musharraf failed in this dream, partly because of the trappings of absolute power and partly because myopic directions from Washington to attack terrorists diverted any education funds there might have been toward weaponry to reign down upon the restive tribes. </p> <p>It is interesting because, Musharraf's dream for Pakistan is exactly the vision of Pakistan's founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who formed a modern, democratic Muslim state on the basis of human rights, women's rights, and minority rights in 1947. It is this vision that both the US and the Pakistani government must return to as the country moves into the post-Musharraf era. This means strengthening the judiciary and rule of law while also reinstating Pakistan's civil service \u2013 the organisation Jinnah once referred to as the \"steel structure\" of the state \u2013 which Musharraf dismantled in favor of the military. </p> <p>The post Musharraf-era is in the hands of the people of Pakistan. The US can help by providing its ally with strong leadership, guidance, and resources to strengthen a fragile democracy. But if America reverts to the same Musharraf-era policies and the law and order situation deteriorates further, Pakistan could soon be saluting a new military dictator.</p>",

It all sounds a bit \"meh\", doesn't it?</p> <p>But then it all feels a bit like that where Torchwood 3 is concerned. The facts: the grown-up Who spin-off's third season will see it moved up to BBC1, but truncated into just five hour-long episodes: one long story arc shown over consecutive nights. The official line is \"to make a massive noise on BBC1\". But however you spin it, fans - already deprived of a <a href=\" http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/season\">Doctor Who</a> - will still be getting less. Slashing something in half is an odd way of making a big noise about it. And whatever anyone says, the move to the mainstream channel will surely see the supposed adult spin-off toned down. After the fiascos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/03/television.media2\">Bonekickers</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2008/08/as_spinoffs_go_spooks_code.html\">Spooks:Code 9</a>, the BBC's golden touch with cult stuff looks to be slipping away.</p> <p>So should fans be worried? When I quizzed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/audio/2008/jul/14/john.barrowman.alice.wignall\">John Barrowman</a> about it at last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/02/comics.film\">Comic-Con</a>, this is what he bellowed: \"It's going to be a different feel because we're doing five days. Julie (Gardner, executive producer) wants to make an impact on BBC1, and in order to do that we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece. Every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face. It'll be exciting, dramatic and tragic all at the same time.</p> <p>\"It's not going to change, it's not a family show. We're still going to be on after 9pm. Torchwood's a family show if you think it's appropriate for your children to watch it. We just deal with issues of life. But no, it's not going to be toned down. We're still going to be edgy, because that's what we are.\"</p> <p>We'll have to see.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics2008\">2008 Olympics</a> has created an illusion of China to the public and to the outside world. It is so fantastic, so unreal, that the entire meaning of the games is being distorted. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/08/olympics2008.china?picture=336347323\">opening ceremony</a> we saw this global festival <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympics2008.china?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">manipulated</a> for the sake of narrow nationalism.</p> <p>The propaganda system of the Chinese government went into overdrive, public money was spent like water and ranks of mediocre performers were employed to create an alternative, distorted reality. It received fake applause from the country's media and public. Officials from the International Olympic Committee and United Nations also collaborated in the deception with their comments on the success of the games and the improvement of the environment.</p> <p>Whatever happened to the non-politicised festival of sport that we were promised? Anyone who cares about truth should avoid not politics, but Olympic lies. Beijing wants to show off how progressive and harmonious the city has become, so it has expelled migrant workers because they are poor, underpaid and seen as a potential source of insecurity. </p> <p>Yet it was these workers \u2013 these slaves with socialist characteristics \u2013 who laid every brick and tile of the modern urban landscape. For the sake <br>of appearances, even the small shops they frequented have been shut down, along with many street markets, video outlets and clubs. So much for the slogans on the bridges and billboards that read \"Beijing welcomes you\" and \"People's Olympics\".</p> <p>China's media organisations have been told they are only allowed to report the sporting achievements of the games. They are forbidden from covering problems or squabbling. They cannot criticise the cliched, rose-tinted statements of the authorities. With so much government interference, how can anyone say these Olympics are not politicised? </p> <p>It is absurd that so much money has been wasted on manipulating public opinion, on simulating emotion. This nation is notorious for its ability to make or fake anything cheaply. \"Made-in-China\" goods now fill homes around the world. But our giant country has a small problem. We can't manufacture the happiness of our people. </p> <p>This is not something that comes cheap. Real public contentment can't be pirated or copied. No matter how long our politicians order people to sing songs of praise, no matter how many fireworks they launch into the heavens, and no matter how many foreign leaders they embrace, they cannot arouse a genuine mood of joy and celebration among the people. It is as difficult for them to get a real smile as it is to keep the sky blue and the clouds white. </p> <p>Neither fairness nor justice, neither reality nor humanity can be simulated or manipulated by wires or remote control. Those who staged the opening ceremony stopped at nothing to create a fantasy. They faked the footprints of fire with computer graphics. They exploited an innocent child by making her lip-synch to a patriotic song. These people are shameless. The organisers recently announced the theme of the closing ceremony. They tell us it will <br>be about \"emotions\" and \"friendship\", that it will be a night of joy.

  "<p>I still haven't been able to see Singh is Kinng \u2013 every showing has been sold out well ahead of time. So this week I went and saw Ugly Aur Pagli (Ugly And Mad) instead. It was fitting that I should see Bollywood's first attempt at a teen gross-out comedy while suffering from a Delhi-induced bowel disorder. I sat through the movie with my guts rumbling like rusty Russian tanks on their way to Tblisi, my sphincter safely shut tight with an inhuman dose of Immodium. I've been sick only twice during my last four stays here and on both occasions I picked up the bug in a 5-star hotel. Sod's law, huh? This time I got it from sharing a peanut bowl with a pasty German who'd spent the day doing NGO work in a slum. It goes to show you never know where people's hands have been.</p> <p>Feverish, semi-delirious and mildly hysterical, I think I managed to enjoy the movie a lot more than I would have otherwise. The movie got off to a great start with some superbly bad fart jokes \u2013 accompanied with ridiculously arched Indian eyebrows and camp Kenneth Williamsesque facial gestures. Fart jokes are always bad in every culture but brilliant nonetheless (well, I love them anyway). Faced with the prospect of physically exploding in my seat, the gags had an added piquancy that made me howl like a madman \u2013 though everyone else in the audience seemed mortified and, sitting in still and disgusted silence. They sat even stiffer when the movie upped the ante with a vomit scene in which the boozy heroine spews what looks like Capri Sun over someone's head.</p> <p>Puerile as it is, the film is quite brave, showing Indian kids in a much more likeable and honest light than this summer's tame smash-hit Jaane Tu, which portrayed them as mollycoddled uber-nerds. In this film, the youngsters get trashed, puke and make fools of themselves like teenagers in the rest of the free world. It's also a straightforward romance story in which parents, studies and careers don't feature. And if treated young people as individuals wasn't radical enough, there's even a gender-bending theme that runs through it.</p> <p>Kavir (Ranvir Shorey) was raised as a girl by his parents, turning him into a bit of a girl's blouse. I was too spaced out on botulism and Immodium to grasp exactly why they did this, but then most Indian men are raised to be girl-shy sissies \u2013 even if they don't run around in high heels and skirts afterwards like Kavir does. He might have failed his engineering exams four times, but Kavir proves himself to be a cut above the rest of Bollywood male portrayals with his dogged if witless pursuit of the girl of his dreams, the kooky and cantankerous Kuhu (Mallika Sherewat) who slaps him for any possible reason and makes him dress up as a woman and ride a bike with no seat.</p> <p>Shorey is a great actor who exudes a lot of warmth and foppish charm, but the script doesn't make the most of him. The second half of the movie of the movie is merely a repetition of the slapstick, transvestitism and violence that had me giggling merrily for the first hour. Kuhu is India's version of a female chauvinist pig: hard-drinking and foul-mouthed, she seems to have a pathological hatred of men \u2013 especially Kavir. She's an interesting character. I've yet to see an Indian woman get truly plastered in India, but I have been impressed by the assertiveness and independence of young middle-class Indian women here. They all still live with their parents, but they don't seem any more sheltered than the guys are. Seeing a heroine like Kuhu in Bollywood was a pleasant surprise, even though she puts on a salwaar kameez in the end like a good Indian girl and the two finish up as an item.</p> <p>This film is completely stupid but was funny enough to sustain my will to live while my insides were devoured by malignant bacteria: a resounding endorsement for any movie.</p>",
  "<p>One of the fundamental principles of any legal system is that justice should not only be done, but be seen to be done. The <a href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk\">Solicitors Regulation Authority</a> was made aware when it was established two years ago of the disproportionate number of both Afro-Caribbean and Asian solicitors being subject to investigation and disciplinary tribunals. With the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/14/equality.race\">publication</a> of this week's <a href=\"http://www.sra.org.uk/sra/equality-diversity/reports.page\">report</a> by Lord Ouseley, the SRA and the Law Society were shown to have singularly failed to address those fundamental inequalities. There are now approximately 110,000 solicitors in England and Wales, of whom just under 10% are from black and other minority communities. We now know they have experienced an intrusive level of race discrimination at the hands of the SRA, its investigating officers and disciplinary tribunals. </p> <p>Solicitors of African-Caribbean origin are six times as likely (and Asian solicitors three times as likely) as their white counterparts to be investigated by the SRA. This not only affects those firms and their employees, but undermines the principle of equal access to justice by their clients, most of whom belong to those same communities.</p> <p>By contrast City firms and those with more than 26 partners appear completely immune from such investigations. This is all the more remarkable as they employ over 50% of the profession and generate the largest financial turnover. Those firms, however have an overwhelmingly white, middle-class profile and are over-represented on the committees and council of the Law Society. </p> <p>There have been numerous instances of Afro-Caribbean and Asian solicitors who have been disciplined, often after trivial allegations from clients who have lodged a complaint simply because they don't want to pay their bill. Inquiries have often taken more than two years, causing a lot of distress and loss of business to the solicitor concerned, while resulting in no finding against them. White solicitors rarely face such lengthy inquries and, the report found, were far less likely to face disciplinary tribunals.</p> <p>Many black and Asian solicitors have told me that they found the whole process abusive and humiliating. And, even if ultimately cleared, their careers have been damaged \u2013 for example, they cannot apply to be judges while disciplinary action is outstanding. Some solicitors have been forced out of business and their clients, many from black and minority communities, have lost their legal representatives \u2013 often at a crucial time in their case.</p> <p>One British solicitor of Nigerian origin had clients from around the country who were lost to him when his firm was closed down. They were forced to go to white solicitors who had little or no cultural or linguistic understanding of their case. Another solicitor of Muslim origin has been investigated on 12 separate occasions in as many years, inflicting an enormous amount of personal stigma as well as financial loss and damage to his business and reputation. In not one of these has he been found guilty of any wrongdoing. These inquiries are now subject to the first employment tribunal action alleging racism by the Law Society.</p> <p>This report is damning. The SRA's board and chief executive should all accept their responsibility for the debacle and resign. And the Ministry of Justice ought to enforce a major shake-up of the SRA and appoint a new board which has the ability and commitment to combat racism and discrimination within the profession. Action is long overdue, and nothing less than this will give black and minority solicitors and communities any confidence that they can have fair and equal access to justice.</p>",
  "<p>By stepping in to become chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bradfordbingleybusiness\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>, Richard Pym is taking on one of the toughest jobs in the City.</p> <p>The lender is in the 90% club - its shares having lost this amount from their peak of 536p - to just over 55p this morning. Shareholders will be hoping Pym, who retired from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/allianceleicester\">Alliance &amp; Leicester</a> last July, will work enough magic to put some sparkle into the share price after holders of more than 70% of the shares shunned the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/rightsissues\">rights issue</a>.</p> <p>Bid speculation might be an answer, something the accountant will be used to after spending 15 years at A&amp;L. He was finance director when A&amp;L converted from a building society and floated on the stock market 10 years ago and spent the last five as chief executive. </p> <p>But, Pym, a decisive but cautious individual, is expected to arrive without preconceived ideas. He does not sell easily. He was on the A&amp;L board during discussions about an ill-fated deal with Bank of Ireland and as chief executive refused an approach from Credit Agricole. When he retired he insisted A&amp;L had a strong independent future but was proved wrong as the management team he groomed has since agreed to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/15/allianceleicesterbusiness.banking1\">\u00a31.3bn takeover by Spain's Santander</a>.</p> <p>The main criticism thrown at him was that he was too pedestrian at A&amp;L. His targets for growth were regarded as not stretching enough. They have since been abandoned as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> has hammered A&amp;L's prospects along with many other lenders.</p> <p>But he also a reputation for steadying ships. When he became chief executive in 2002 A&amp;L had been without anyone with that title following the ousting of Peter White in a row over the failed Bank of Ireland deal. John Windeler acted as executive chairman and appointed a Lloyds TSB executive - who did not stay long - in the role of managing director.</p> <p>Pym's arrival into the chief executive's seat marked a change in strategy - the ending of an advertising campaign featuring an eskimo - accompanied by a simple but effective move to publish all the lender's best prices in branch windows. A&amp;L largely shunned high <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/12/businessglossary69\">loan-to-value mortgages</a> and only copied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock's</a> controversial 125% mortgage product last year as the credit crunch started to bite.</p> <p>When he announced his retirement from A&amp;L at the age of 57, Pym would say little about his future plans, other than a quip about selling programmes at Arsenal football club. </p> <p>But he had privately told friends he had one more job in him and would have been chief executive of Northern Rock if private equity house JC Flowers had been successful in its bid for the now nationalised lender.</p> <p>A retailer by background - he made his name as an executive director of the Burton Group in the late 1980s - Pym is also chairman of Halfords.</p> <p>He might yet achieve his stated aim of retiring before he turns 60 and lose his reputation for caution if he can find a buyer for B&amp;B in the coming year.</p>",
  "<p>This morning China's Olympic Games lost its biggest star when Liu Xiang, the Olympic 110m hurdle champion and a Chinese national icon, pulled up injured before he had even reached the first hurdle of the opening round of his title defence.</p> <p>His withdrawal shocked the 90,000 strong crowd into silence. The Bird's Nest Stadium was filled to capacity in anticipation of Liu's race, and across China his many fans are struggling to process the news.</p> <p>Liu had suffered a hamstring injury in May, causing him to withdraw from the New York grand prix. It was a new injury that troubled him today though, a combination of damage to the achilles tendon of his right leg and a bone spur on his ankle. Liu's right foot is his take-off foot, meaning the ankle joint comes under enormous pressure.</p> <p>His coach, Sun Haiping, said that the tendon problems had plagued Liu for \"six or seven years, even before he won gold at Athens 2004\". The problem flared up again in training last Saturday, and despite the best efforts of the team and their extensive medical support staff, it could not be cured in time for today's race.</p> <p>\"When he was in the warm-up area for the race the problem suddenly intensified again, but despite the pain he still exercised fully,\" commented the head coach of China's athletics team, Feng Shuyong, \"After more treatment he decided to enter the first round.\" </p> <p>Liu's heat was the final race of the morning session. After the gun went, the hurdlers were recalled for a false start. Liu had already pulled up and, instead of returning to his blocks, he limped off the track.</p> <p>\"We have had three doctors working on Liu's injury,\" Sun said shortly before he broke down in tears at his press conference, \"but no matter what they did nothing could help.\"</p> <p>With the Chinese population certain to be furious in their frustration, Feng was keen to emphasise just how much pain Liu was in. \"Liu would never withdraw from a race unless the pain was intolerable, unless he had no other way out. He came into the event with the strongest possible will, and was determined to compete.</p> <p>\"It is a very hard moment for all of us. I have just spoken to Liu outside and he is very depressed. I watched as he was being given a massage on the damaged area last weekend, and he was shivering due to the great pain.\"</p> <p>Asked why he had not made the news of Liu's injury public knowledge, Feng insisted that the story had appeared in several Sunday newspapers. He added that \"after the treatment we didn't realise how serious the injury was, so we didn't want to tell people he couldn't compete.\" That defence seemed to contradict his earlier observations about the extent of Liu's agony. </p> <p>It seems likely that it was a combination of Liu's own determination and pressure from those around him that led him to appear on the start line at all. When he won the 110m hurdles in Athens he became China's first ever male gold medallist on the track, and since then he has become a national hero. His face appears on billboards across China, and the public expectation for him to win again was huge.</p> <p>\"Of course the pressure on him was huge,\" Feng stated, \"he doesn't go out often but when he does he sees his face everywhere. But he has always said that you do not compete against everyone else, you only compete against yourself. He has unique mental strength.\"</p> <p>Today Liu's body did get better of him. Feng stated that he does not believe Liu will run again this season, but fully expects him to appear again next year. That will be small consolation for the distraught Chinese public. Liu's confrontation with Cuban world record holder Dayron Robles was due to be one of the gala events of the entire Games, but with Liu out of the competition interest in the athletic contests is likely to wane significantly.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/18/olympics2008.olympicsathletics?picture=336702355\">View a gallery of Liu Xiang's failed bid for gold</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Britain enjoyed a good morning at the Bird's Nest stadium. Phillips Idowu cast off memories of Athens 2004 by qualifying for the triple jump final with his first attempt. </p> <p>In his last Olympic final qualifier Idowu had produced three no-jumps, but today he bounded to 17.44m with his first effort. His distance, the longest ever achieved in China, was unsurpassed by any of his rivals. </p> <p>Idowu's was a commanding performance, but across the field in the opening round of the men's 200 metres the new 100m champion, Usain Bolt, ran with a different kind of authority. </p> <p>Bolt's 20.64sec put him second in his heat, behind Trinidad and Tobago's Rondell Sorillo, but he barely broke sweat in the process, and seemed to almost jog around the track, turning his head to admire the view as he went. </p> <p>It was a confidence-inspiring morning for the British team. In the men's 400m Martin Rooney and Andrew Steele won their heats, with Steele producing a personal best of 44.94sec. </p> <p>Both men have avoided being drawn in the semi-final with the world and Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner. With Rooney recording 45.00sec, Steele was prompted to say the pair were \"bringing it back to the old days when we had many people with personal bests under 45 seconds.\" </p> <p>In the 200m Christian Malcolm, with 20.42sec, and Marlon Devonish, with 20.49sec, finished second and fourth fastest in qualifying for the second round. Britain's third runner, Alex Nelson, withdrew injured before the race. </p> <p>Idowu was joined in the triple jump final by his team-mate Larry Achike, whose second effort of 17.18m cleared the automatic qualifying mark by eight centimetres. Nathan Douglas, so recently returned from injury, was unable to make it a trio of British finalists in the event. </p> <p>Zoe Derham was also knocked out of the women's hammer, her best throw of 64.74m leaving her 19th in her group.</p>",

GB! GB! - although fear \"Mundane\" might be closer to the mark.</p> <p>They've forced us to get out of most of our boats and off most of our bikes, meaning GB's chances of more gold have diminished. Hours away, after 11am, which is practically the night, the men's pursuit team -- <strong>Ed Clancy, Paul Manning, Geraint Thomas</strong> and <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong> -- go in the velodrome, and where there's a Wiggins there's always a way. </p> <p>Sailors <strong>Nick Rogers</strong> and <strong>Joe Glanfield</strong> float into view in their men's 470 class boat at around 6am, but possibly an even hotter prospect in some water (at least for a bit) is World Champion triathlete <strong>Helen Tucker</strong>. She's be swimming, biking and running at 3am, alongside <strong>Hollie Avil</strong>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the new, scarlet-haired Jonathan Edwards, <strong>Phillips Idowu</strong>, starts his triple jump campaign, although the final is not today. The gymnast <strong>Beth Tweddle</strong> is going to do battle with the uneven bars, and the man-mountain David Price, who weighs as much as eight or nine Tweddles, fights in the super heavyweight boxing division.</p> <p>Before all that, there's <strong>Lightning \"Usain\" Bolt</strong> to consider. The faster jogger over 100m in the world is the main attraction in the Bird's Nest stadium as the heats of the 200m begin. There are three members of Team GB! GB! GB! who have hopefully been practicing their heel-clipping over the past couple of days, else <strong>Marlon Devonish</strong>, <strong>Alex King</strong> and <strong>Christian Malcolm</strong>, and anyone else, do not have a prayer.</p> <p>Emails please. Please. No really, please.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2am: Athletics:</strong> And before all that, it's the heats of the <strong>men's 400m</strong>, where the top three go through. Leslie Djhone, of France, wins it, although I only watched it as I was grappling with the coffee machine, so can't say much more than that. Oh, here's the result: David Neville, of the USA, and Cuban William Collazo also qualify.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.07am:</strong> The runners in the second heat of the 400m are on the track, and there are as many British runners in this as there are emails in the my inbox, which is zilch. Last night, I was hopeful of attracting some drunks stumbling in from the pub, but presumably they had Quizcall to watch on Channel 5. Tonight, I feel that the target audience comprises mainly depressive Sunday night insomniacs or the kind of crackpots who usually call talk radio stations. You're welcome, all of you and your harebrains.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.10am: Athletics: </strong>The London law firm of Brown, Millburn and Wissman and Bizman qualify. That's Chris, Joel and Johan from the Bahamas, Australia and Sweden.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.15am: Athletics: </strong>There's nowt else going on at the Games at the moment, so the third heat of the 400m it is. This one is way more stretched out than the previous two, with Nery Brenes of Costa Rica streets ahead of Godday James, of Nigeria. Andretti Bain, of the Bahamas took third. Next up is \"Britain's finest\" Martyn Rooney in heat four.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.20am: Athletics: </strong>\"I'm going to see if I can really challenge them,\" says Rooney in a pre-race interview, which is a good place to start. He's wearing shades and has a spillage of iron-filings on his chin. Let's get behind him anyway. \"He's got size 13 feet,\" says the Beeb's commentator. \"Yes, absolutely amazing,\" says the easily pleased Colin Jackson.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.25am: Athletics: </strong> Rooney is off in lane seven...Rooney is running...he's round the corner...those size 13 propelling him to... first place! Great run from the Brit, a comfortable run and he's through to the next round.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.27am:</strong> \"It felt pretty good,\" said Rooney, before admitting that he hasn't run much recently. \"It's an amazing track, an amazing stadium, an amazing track,\" he said, with the suspicion that he might just be patronising us. Still, he's through and is in the \"outside hopes\" category for a medal.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.33am:</strong> An email: \"Don't be so hard on yourself,\" says \"Gareth\". I'll try, but it's not easy. \"I'm sure lots of your readers are perfectly normal working folks who find the live report a concise and accessible way of keeping up with the Olympics.\" Thanks. \"Not me though, I'm on drugs.\" Oh.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.35am:</strong> Another email, and if in doubt, let's revert to Aussie bashing: \"Another glorious day in Sydney as the locals wake up to find Team GB is way ahead on the medal tables,\" says Steve Keys. \"Of course, I always welcome more facts to really help put the boot in. So, realistically what are our chances of staying ahead of the Aussies by the end of the week? I want details.\" You've come to the wrong place.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.37am: Athletics:</strong> Heat five of the 400m goes to Lashawn Merritt of the United States, who is one of the favourites for the title. Sam Weipogwa and Claudio Licciardello are second and third.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.40am:</strong> It's the women's hammer throw in which Great Britain's Zoe Derham has just wanged it 64.74m. Just sticking to the facts here. \"Not very good losers, the Aussies,\" says Dave Hill, another British ex-pat Down Under, hopefully preparing the egg that he'll soon be wiping off his chops. \"I've written the medal table in very large letters on our whiteboard at work.\" Keep the wiper handy, that's all I'm saying.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.40am: Athletics:</strong> More heats success for Team GB! GB! GB! as Andrew Steele wins the sixth one-lap preliminary race in 44.94 seconds, which is a lifetime best. Renny Quow is second, Michael Mathieu third.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2.48am: Athetics:</strong> The World Champion Jeremy Warriner eases to first place in his heat and that wraps up the first round of the 400m. The two Brits involved -- Martyn Rooney and Andrew Steele -- both qualified for the semi-finals. Worse news for Alex Nelson, due to run in the 200m, won't. He's knacked a hamstring.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2.55am:</strong> Kyle Brown has written an essay, and even though I can't for the life of me fathom why he's sent it in now, there's nothing else to digest at the moment, so here it is: \"Why is the world still refering to the US Mens bball team as the \"Dream Team\"? Here in the US, \"The Dream Team\" refers unambiguously to the one and only Dream Team - the '92 team.</p> <p>All the teams since then have been pretenders. The 92 team was an unbelievable collection of talent - 1992 had the best collection of talent you could assemble from any single year in bball history. There isn't any other year in bball had so many spectacularly good players playing at the same time. By happy coincidence, the IOC openned up basketball to pros, and the rest was history. An amazing team indeed.</p> <p>The current US team isn't know as the Dream Team here in the US, it is universally referred to as the \"Redeem Team\". Most American feel the NBA owes us a better team than it has produced in previous years. It has been hard to recruit some top players and hard to get them to play as a team. It has also been hard to pick a good international team (rules are slightly different in the international game, meaning you need a slightly different selection of players. More outside shooters. Better emphasis on defense. For soccer (er, football) fans, you might think of what kind of team you'd get if you let the dumbest fans pick the team - all strikers, no midfield or defence, and a single keeper. The last two US olympic teams before this one were kind of assembled that way, with somewhat predictable results.</p> <p>And as far as dominance goes, the US women's team has been more dominant. But due to worldwide collective misogeny, they'll get little attention.\"</p> <p>I probably can't officially talk for \"the world\" on this one, Kyle, but I'll apologise on their behalf nonetheless. But if you're going to write that much, at least write \"basketball\" out in full next time.

They're both in Tokyo and both fuming about the Japanese coverage of the Games. \"All I get to see are events with Japan in, and within those usually only the Japanese athletes,\" moans Fergus. \"It's rubbish and very frustrating.\" John says: \"My favourite TV moment so far was yesterday in the women's marathon, when the Japanese commentator announced: \"We apologise to viewers who want to see more of the [dismally disappointing] Japanese runners. We're relying on the international feed, and they tend to mostly show the leaders.\" You want me to share your email addresses?</p> <p>Actually John, don't get me started on the marathon coverage. It was far worse here, far worse. All we got was Brave Paula, who was running with a stress fracture in her leg, and finished 23rd.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.50am:</strong> Poor Hollie Avil has a knacked bike in the triathlon, and has stopped. But she's a Brit. On a bike. That's not right.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.55am:</strong> Three laps gone, three to go in the cycling section of the <strong>triathlon</strong> and Helen Tucker is in second place by millionths of a second. She's right up there. Bad news in the women's shot put, where Britain's <strong>Zoe Denham</strong> didn't make the qualifying standard, despite throwing it further than the winning chuck of eight years ago. Timing. Always timing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.57am: Triple jump</strong> Onochie \"Larry\" Achike is also into the final of the triple jump. Let's call him Larry. Hollie Avil has mended her bike in the triathlon and is back in the second pack (of two).</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4am:</strong> Another complaint about television coverage, this time from Pennsylvania: \"I am watching the pommel horse and women's 200m qualifiers,\" says Nick Evans. \"There aren't many people who have anything complimentary to say about the qualities of alcoholic beverages produced in the USA, but I had never heard that time travel was part of the experience.\" American beer. [Shakes head ruefully.]</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.03am:</strong> Holly Avil is now out of the triathlon. \"She ran out of gas,\" says the commentator, and follows up with \"She had a stomach upset,\" which earned a snigger here. Helen Tucker, however, is right up there. Kate Bevis is loving Japanese television coverage: \"Last night they interviewed Kosuke Kitajima (100m and 200m breast-stroke gold medallist). The first thing he showed us?- the big zit on his forehead. Apparently it's down to stress and general tiredness.\" Actually, that reminds me. Someone emailed last night to say that the Chinese coverage was blurring out the athlete's belly buttons during the women's marathon. I dismissed it as a wind up, but was that true?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.06am:</strong> The strangely-neglected men's beach volleyball quarter-finals are getting underway. Nope, neither do I.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.10am:</strong> The heats of the men's 110m hurdles are starting in the Bird's Nest. We were once a shoo-in for a medal there, what with Colin Jackson and all. Not any more. Meanwhile, the triathletes are still on their bike with about one lap left until they can do it all again on foot. The Brazilian Mariana Ohata has gone out to the front on her own, but Our Helen is in the chasing pack.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.14am:</strong> As GB! if GB! by GB! magic GB!, Helen GB! Tucker GB! is GB! in GB! the GB! lead!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.16am:</strong> Wipeout! Massive collision in the triathlon and someone clips someone else's wheel and they all go down like a sack of cyclists. It was the second group, rather than the lead group, so Team GB's hopes remain intact. But some marshalls in white shirts and white caps are suddenly brought into emergency action and kick water bottles off the track with impressive efficiency.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.19am: </strong>Dave Hill has just written <em>exactly</em> what I've been intending to write on the subject of biased coverage of the Olympics: \"I think it's safe to say that whatever country you're in when the Olympics is on is purely focused on their own athletes and potential successes and failures. GB! GB! GB! used to be different because we won so little that the Beeb had no choice but to show a wide range of events.\" That's spot on, that, except that I think the Beeb might be even worse than a lot of those other broadcasters. If you'd have seen the marathon yesterday, and the coverage of Radcliffe in favour of everything else, you'd all be hanging Auntie out to dry right now.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.21am:</strong> The triathletes are now on foot, with the Australian Emma Snowsill and Andrea Hewitt, of New Zealand, showing a clean quartet of heels to the chasing pack, which includes Helen Tucker.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4.30am: </strong>Emma Snowsill from, whisper it, Australia, is way out in front in the triathlon and no one is getting anywhere near her. Meanwhile, there's some kind of controversy/nationwide disaster brewing in the 110m hurdles, where the Chinese hurdling sensation Liu Xiang, who is the reigning Olympic and World Champion over the jumps, is, apparently out. He's carrying some kind of knack and won't come out to compete in the heats. Neither will the European champion Stanislav Olijar, apparently, but the Latvian's absence is unlikely to cause a day of mourning quite like Xiang's will.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.35am:</strong> Tucker's luck. She's dropped way out of the chase now and is 17th. Boo. Emma Snowsill is miles ahead.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.38am:</strong> The American Laura Bennett and the Portuguese Vanessa Fernandes are in second and third place here in the triathlon, with Emma Snowsill already got this one locked up. In the spirit of unbiased British journalism, and with Helen Tucker 17th, the latest men's beach volleyball score is 2-2 in the second game between Holland and Georgia.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.43am: </strong>\"Dave Hill's comment [4.19am] is just the kind of level-headed analysis we can do without at the Olympics, thank you very much,\" says leading jingoist John Senior. \"I don't want unbiased coverage; I want hilariously over-the-top Barry Davies-style Team GB! GB! GB! cheerleading.\" OK, here goes: Andy Turner, of GB! GB! GB! is through the heats in the 110m hurdles. (He's a Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, so let's not get too excited, OK.)</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.48am:</strong> Just go with this, because it's true. An errant milk float -- possibly driven by a bunch of Aussie-bashing MBM contributors -- has just led Emma Snowsill off the correct course in the triathlon. Really. The Australian, who is more than a minute ahead of everyone else, followed it off the track, before she was ushered back onto the right way.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.51am:</strong> China is open-jawed and fuming as Liu Xiang is definitely out of the 110m hurdles. He'd picked up an injury in training, but such was the expectation on him that he came out anyway to try to qualify in the heat. But he couldn't even make it to the first hurdle before he hobbled back down the tunnel. Never mind, it could be worse: Team GB's Allan Scott qualified by finishing fourth. Every cloud, etc.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.57am: Triathlon: </strong>Emma Snowsill wins the women's triathlon by a long, long, long way. Britain's Helen Tucker doesn't.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>4.59am:</strong> If you're just tuning in, here's my advice. Don't bother scrolling through any of this: click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/martynrooney\">this shiny hyperlink</a> instead and read Andy Bull's athletics round-up from this morning. The other thing you really need to know is that the Chinese hurdling sensation Liu Xiang did not compete in the 110m hurdles after getting knacked in training. A nation mourns.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.06am:</strong> Alex in Sydney has a suggestion: \"Can we petition the IOC to make the triathlon even more exciting by adding a fourth event for example archery, or a gymnastics floor round.\" Triathlon? What triathlon?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.09am:</strong> After a trouncing for Team GB! GB! GB!'s Helen Tucker in the triathlon at the hands of the Australian Emma Snowsill, it's time for any Brits Down Under to find their inner Lithuanian. The Aussies are up against them in the quarter finals of the basketball and are absolutely spanking the Lithuanians 55-29 in the third quarter.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.15am:</strong> Repeat. Flick. Repeat. Flick. Repeat. Flick. Nothing on at the Games at the moment, so I suggest you take the time to read this: <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/heroic_radcliffe_learns_from_w.html\">Richard Williams reckons Paula Radcliffe can still win an Olympic gold</a><br><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/100000_condoms_16500_competito.html\">Marina Hyde has been counting condoms in the athletes' village</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.michaelphelps?picture=336676283\">A load of photographers have been taking some photos</a><br>And even though this one is from yesterday, it's still good: <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/17/bulgarias_national_hero_so_goo.html\">Andy Bull grapples with a Bulgarian wrestler</a></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am: </strong>You're really not missing anything at the Games (unless you count basketball, in which the Australians are now 75-51 up against the Lithuanians, and we don't count that), so here's this from Anne-Marie Bremner: \"Ok, it was probably excruciating to watch the BBC coverage of Paula's tearful performance yesterday.\" Yes. Yes it was. \"But Dave Hill's right; certainly the Aussie coverage is unashamedly biased to Australia \u2013 and why not? However I did have an urge to write to my MP (if I had one) about the broadcasting of archery (with no Aussies even competing) whilst Team GB! GB! GB! was busily storming towards more cycling medals. Then they had the audacity to show Aussie rules 'football' instead of any Olympics. What were they thinking? Well, words fail me.\"<br>Good news: the Australian basketballers will probably play the USA in the next round, for whom complacency is the only real opponent.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.37am:</strong> John Senior is spinning this very well: \"Well done to Emma Snowsill. Another gold for the British Empire! Thanks to Michael Phelps (born in Maryland, thus one of ours) I reckon with about 40 golds we're holding our own against Julius Caesar and Genghis Khan, even though the former has the advantage that Team GB!'s medals count for him as well. We're certainly miles ahead of Napoleon, and, as Barry Davies might have said, 'Where were the Assyrians? Quite frankly, who cares?'\"</p> <p>I'm drinking green and nettle tea. How very Guardian.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.42am:</strong> We're watching extended repeats at the moment of the Liu Xiang debacle earlier, and it's more heartbreaking than a hundred Paula Radcliffe marathon hobbles. The Bird's Nest stadium was filled to bursting point with chicks hoping for Xiang to deposit a tasty morsel into their cheeping beaks, but anyone who'd been watching the news wires (which, remarkably, included us here) knew that he'd twanged an Achilles tendon and couldn't compete. Still, he came out, went through a warm-up, all the time crying in pain and clutching his Achilles, and then tried to make it to the first hurdle on what was, in the event, a false start, and he couldn't get there. He limped off down the tunnel and there was all round disbelief in the Bird's Nest, which emptied double quick. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/liuxiang\">Here's another way of putting it.</a></p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.48am: </strong>I can't detect any irony at all in Will Sinclair's latest dispatch, so I give him the honour of being the first Aussie (knowingly) published today: \"Even as an Australian in Sydney, I'm thoroughly enjoying the banter and Aussie-bashing that has been such a feature of the Guardian's Olympics coverage. Quite frankly, it's about time your lot came to the party and, just like in the Ashes, we're happy for you to have a win every 20 years or so. It keeps things interesting. Best of luck for the rest of the Games!\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.55am:</strong> Michael Lee has an answer to Liu Xiang's malaise: \"Well, I guess he will be out of favour with the Chinese people/government. Maybe he should pack his bags and ask for political asylum somewhere. We can take him in, just like we took Ms Budd in the 80's. Are there any rules preventing athletes representing more than one nation in different Olympics? Has it been done before?\" Well has it, great, all-knowing MBM readership?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.58am:</strong> \"Table tennis! Croatia beat Mexico!\" We're in a slump. \"India have won the toss, and will bat against Sri Lanka. You're up to date.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6.09am:</strong> A combination of Google, Wikipedia and an email correspondent named Pommie Bastard has come up with the name of Oksana Chusovitina to answer Michael Lee's question from 5.55am. Chusovitina won silver in the vault yesterday and has previously represented Uzbekistan and the CIS at the Olympics, before moving to Germany to get leukaemia treatment for her son and taking up citizenship there, repaying them with gymnastics success. Next!</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.19am: Sailing: </strong> Wonderful, some live action. It's the men's double-hander 470 class medal race in the sailing. The Aussies are leading this race at the moment, France are in second, from Argentina and Japan. Great Britain are in sixth.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.21am: Sailing: </strong> If it stays like this, the British sailors will finish in third overall and take a bronze medal. The Dutch have it locked up, I think, with France second. These are the words of someone winging it right now, but I'm hoping to pick up a degree of authority as we go on.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.25am: Sailing:</strong> Winging it is the order of the day, it seems, as even the Beeb's commentator doesn't seem too sure of what's going on. Apparently, the Spanish boat may or may not be able to catch the Brits for the bronze medal. There's some great graphics on the coverage, mind you. It's like watching virtual racing from Steepledowns, only with boats. And without desperate punters trying to get their fix between real horse races from betting on a computer game.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.28am: Sailing: </strong>A helpful Australian correspondent William Sinclair has just piped up with what the television commentators have confirmed: the gold medal in this 470 is already going Down Under. Congratulations Australia. However, that means that <em>this</em> race is all for the silver or bronze and at the moment, Team GB! GB! GB! is gunning for silver. \"To leaven the tiresome Team GB! etc. coverage,\" says Shamini, gutted in Singapore. \"I thought I would let you know that the Malaysian Lee Chong Wei was trounced in the badminton men's final.\"</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.33am: Sailing: </strong>\"I'm a little bit worried that Australia are about to overhaul us in the tables,\" says serial MBM contributor Andrew Jolly. \"Especially as they have two sailing crews who are guaranteed gold, not to mention the bloke in the triathlon. If my A-level maths serves me well, that would put them on 12, one ahead of us at the very least.\" That's true, and the Aussies have just officially wrapped up one of those golds in the 470 class. But Britain, it seems, have just got the silver. Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield are the names.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.38am: Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield win silver in 470 class sailing.</strong> They finish second in medal race, which promotes them from fourth position at the start of the race, to second overall. Australia win gold.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.43am: Sailing:</strong> Nick Rogers, silver medallist in the 470 sailing, is \"over-the-moon\" in classic British sportsman vernacular. \"At one point, Nick and I thought we'd lost it,\" said Glanfield. \"Just really pleased that we turned it around and did what we could.\" Gotta love platitudes.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.50am: </strong>Will Sinclair and Andrew Jolly need to get a room and have this one out in a big Anglo-Aussie sweat fest: \"I don't think Andrew Jolly should worry too much about the Aussies pulling ahead of TEAM GB! TEAM GB! TEAM GB! (as I understand they're officially known),\" jabs Sinclair. \"I'm sure the British cyclists still have a heap of medals to win in the velodrome. They've already cleaned up in the Riding Fastest In A Line, Riding Fastest By Yourself, Riding Fastest on the Opposite Side of the Track, Riding Fastest On The Same Side of the Track and, most impressively, Riding Fastest Behind A Little Chinese Bloke On A Moped. Surely there are at least a few more of these convoluted events to come.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.54am:</strong> Another serial MBM correspondent who goes by the name \"Alex in Sydney (not Alexander Pace)\" has another turncoat Olympian for us, in the form of Australian/Hungarian judo player Maria Pekli, who is making her fifth Olympics appearance. \"In 1992 and 1996 she represented her native country, Hungary, before switching to Australia for the 2000 Games, where she won the bronze medal.\"</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.59am: Sailing</strong> The women's 470 race is going to get underway pretty soon, and Australia also have that one locked up before the final race. Shall we cover it? Well, it's done already really, isn't it.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>7.07am: Sailing</strong> Brazil lead Austria in the women's 470 race at the moment, with Holland up there too. Australia are nowhere to be seen, but don't need to be. They've already got the gold. The battle for the silver and bronze is between the Brazilians and the Israelis. The British team has just \"sliced in front of the Italians,\" apparently, and we're reduced to sabotage.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>7.13am: Saling:</strong> I hold my hands up, I'm no sailing commentator. According to someone who is, the Israeli boat now leads the Brazilian boat, with Italy third. Britain are in fifth. Holland are last for the second consecutive race which is, apparently, a \"disaster for Dutch sailing.\" In other sailing, Britain's Nick Dempsey is doing well in the windsurfing and will be a definite medal shout in tomorrow's medal race.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7.16am:</strong> \"Does anyone understand the rules of sailing?\" wonders Greg Webster. \"I feel like I'm reading the minute by minute on live piracy. Have they hoisted a skull and crossbones yet?\" Not yet, but if the BBC commentator told me that they had, I'd likely repeat it here. It seems straightforward enough: they go up and around a big buoy a couple of times, then the first boat across the finish line wins. They do this numerous times, wind permitting, over a few days, and then whoever gets the fewest points wins.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.19am: Sailing: </strong>\"It is Brazil. It is Israel.\" That's the one-two in the sailing so far. Germany and Spain just sailed into each other, largely irrelevantly.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.28am:</strong> Brazil are around the \"top mark\" (a yellow buoy) first, holding off the Israelis. The British team are in third in this race, but can't trouble the medal positions. Holland, however, <em>can</em> upset the applecart, and are up into fifth in this race, which means they could steal the silver. I have a very low expectancy that anyone is interested in this -- don't think I don't know -- but the only other channels I can see are showing repeats of Phillips Idowu's qualifying jump in the triple jump from hours ago, the warm up in the table tennis bronze medal match, and a static ident.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.30am:</strong> I've made a decision which will, I expect, empty my inbox for the rest of the day. It's this: the GB-Australia duel is over. It's a tie. I can't referee any more of it and suggest you all get together and have a great big live banter off against one another. The Australian home leg can take place in Earl's Court, the British in a hostel in Brisbane somewhere.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.33am: Sailing:</strong> The Brazilians take this race, from the Israelis and the Italians. Australia win the gold (it was already in the bag), Holland take silver and Brazil's win means that they get bronze.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.45am:</strong> Some more links have just been added to the top of this article for you to catch up on what's been going on so far. Xiang Liu's injury meant he had to pull out of the 110m hurdles; Helen Tucker missed out by a mere 22 places in her attempt to add Olympic triathlon title to her World Championship; Team GB got a silver in the sailing. Meanwhile, here's Will Sinclair again: \"Can I ask your British readers a serious question?\" Sure. \"Why can't TEAM GB! get their act together and enter a football team in the Olympics? I don't care about the men (who, let's face it, have more than ample opportunity to be bundled out of major sporting events), but I imagine it would be a HUGE boost to British women footballers to have a major event like the Olympics at which to raise their profile. I don't know for sure, but I suspect the answer will have something to do with overpaid, self-important male administrators who are more worried about keeping their seat on the gravy train than encouraging women's football.\" I think it's likely we'll have to have a football team, both men and women, in the London Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> Another one of those lulls in the action, but some good news for you, better for me, is that Tom Lutz will be here soon to take you to the end of the day.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>8.01: </strong>Here's Tom. Thanks for all your emails through the night. Congratulations Australia, who have now overtaken Brave Team GB! GB! GB! in the medal table, but there's some velodrome action this afternoon, so all you ex-pats Down Under can continue sharpening your barbs for later.

Anyone want to tally a ranking according to non-medalist finalists?\" Not me, I've got table tennis to report on, but I reckon there's someone with two hours of their life to waste.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.34am: </strong>The good doctor Brabants storms to victory in his heat. He drove his legs very well apparently, which, as everyone knows, is vital at this level.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>8.37am: </strong>Gardos, who looks a bit like a worried Jamie Bell, wastes a match point, Ryu comes back with a cross court winner and it's now 2-1 in games.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.41am: </strong>\"RE: Will Sinclair and Team GB Football (7.45AM).

Are we destined to spend the next four years going through this,\" says Kevin McKenzie, who, to be fair, <em>is</em> the one ensuring the argument goes on for another four minutes.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.45am: </strong>Second heat of the kayaking and Brabants' closest rival for the gold, Adam van Koeverden of Canada, cruises home in first.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.49am: </strong>\"How about we replace football with Futsal,\" asks Andrew Jolly.

I can't help but feel there's a link in there to the kayaker's love-factory too [LEGAL NOTE: THERE ISN'T].</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>9.26am: </strong>BOA chief Simon Clegg says Team Hubris can beat the Aussies in the medal table at London 2012. \"I'm absolutely convinced we can beat them in 2012 - whether we can beat them here in Beijing we need to wait and see,\" he said. \"But we're ahead at the moment and that's where we'd like to stay.\" In other news, Australia have moved ahead of Team Pride Comes Before A Fall in the medal table.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>9.29am: </strong>I should confirm that it was the Bad Kayaker that was found with a stash of pills in his car and not Tim Maitland.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>9.33am: </strong> Some proper sport at last! The women's points race is off and we're in the company of Hugh Porter, one of the best commentators on television. He can talk for hours on end without pause and there's not one piece of wasted information. Jake Humphries: listen and learn. Gold medallist Rebecca Romero is racing for Team Jingoism in this one.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>9.35am: </strong>\"Is there a male/female medal table,\" demands Tom Gurney. \"Who would be winning? And more importantly, how would Queen Elizabeth II's ladies be performing were the medals to be broken down?\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>9.38am: </strong>Romero is yet to make an impact, but judging from her interviews she is the most single-minded woman this side of a gestalt, and no doubt she'll run (or cycle) away with it. Vos of Netherlands is leading at the moment, with Romero yet to score.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>9.39am: </strong>Yipes! A huge crash in the cycling, Romero wasn't involved, but a few of the cyclists are down and look like they're staying down. You're allowed a few laps out if you have a crash, but the US former world champions is clutching her collar bone and looks like she might not be back again.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>9.44am: </strong>\"Team Pride Comes Before a Fall? If the Games stopped now, 11 Golds is fantastic,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I just can't believe it, to be honest. Is it really us?\" I know, all this success is making me nervous, it's like punching above your weight in a relationship, you know it's too good to be true and you're just waiting to be horribly dumped.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>9.49am: </strong>Tim Brabants has been having a wee chat about his win in the kayaking. \"It was comfortable rather than easy. Some people said it looked easy but it is never easy in an Olympic Games when you have other world class athletes there,\" he said. \"It was a bit odd when I found someone had smuggled Class A drugs into my kayak, mind,\" he definitely didn't add.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>9.51am: </strong>Romero has made a break in the points race and gets her first points as she finishes second (that's worth three points) in the sixth sprint. If you don't know about the rules of the points race, the riders basically zoom round for 100 laps with the winners of section getting points. Most points win the medal. Vos of Netherlands is winning and looks very comfortable indeed.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>9.53am: </strong>South Korea have won bronze in the men's team table tennis. Well done them.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>9.58am: </strong>\"You've probably watched more of this than me so I'd value your opinion on this,\" starts Matthew West, vastly overvaluing my opinion. \"Has there been an interview carried out with a competitor by a BBC reporter that hasn't made you want to go at your eyes and ears with a fish hook and red hot knitting needle respectively? Christ. They must have enough time to think up two vaguely pertinent questions to ask. Instead they spout some matey rubbish at them and the poor sod(s) sit there looking bemused. They one at the sailing is worst. If I was the Yngling (womens! Not girls! They all look over 18 to me) crew I would have koshed him over the head, bundled him into my boat and dumped him two miles out in the sea.\" </p> <p>Hmmm, yes there are a few rubbish ones, particularly patronising claptrap with (some) women competitors. But anything Chiles discusses is usually top-notch. The best thing about him is he asks questions you want to know the answer to, like how does it actually feel to be punched in the face by an Olympic boxer.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>9.58am: </strong>Vos is pretty much guaranteed the gold now, and unless Romero puts together something amazing, she won't finish in the medals.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>10.05am: </strong>\"Cycling is a religion in Holland,\" lies Hazel Irvine. Vos wins gold for Netherlands in the women's points race \u2013 she was dominant from start to finish - Gonzales wins silver for Cuba and Spain clinch bronze. Yep, that's right I didn't catch her name. <strong>Romero finishes a respectable 11th.</strong> \"Team GB! GB! GB!'s success at these Games can largely be put down to the fact your lot has finally realised you're better off concentrating on those sports with a relatively high number of medals and a relatively low number of competitive nations,\" says Will Sinclair. \"We Aussies have known it for years. When we find out who told you Brits, they're in for a frightful beating.\"</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>10.10am: </strong>Victoria Pendleton wins her first race of the sprint quarter-finals, coming from behind to destroy her Lithuanian opponent. \"I see that the archery in 2012 is due to take place at Lord's,\" says Simon Thomas. Correct. \"I worry that the 'famous' slope is going to take effect and ruin it all. Perhaps they haven't thought of this at all yet and after they move it to the Oval, Lord Coe is going to call me the 'Saviour of the Games'. A modern day Pickles, if you will.\"</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>10.14am: </strong>Croatia have beaten China in the handball. With the Liu going out of the 110m hurdles this Olympics is fast turning into a disaster for the Chinese. Croatia, on the other hand, are the new Team GB! GB! GB! They beat Iran 91-57 in the basketball.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>10.17am: </strong> Back in the women's sprint, Guo of China just put in a very impressive performance in her quarter-final, Victoria Pendleton could have some competition. And if for you can't live without a page dedicated to Pendleton, then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/victoriapendleton\">I've just handed you a lifeline</a>.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>10.23am: </strong><strong>Chris Hoy wins his quarter-final in the men's sprint</strong> and Hugh Porter gets to purr about cyclists thighs again. It's good to see men being objectified for once. \"It's true that Team GB seems to be playing to its strengths, I feel like there have been several events where medals could have been won if there was a more driving instinct to win,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"There have been at least four or five medals, if not more, where GB should've placed, and need to do better if they want to stake a claim in the top five or so.\" Hmmm, a bit harsh maybe, but it's true that there have been a few results where there's been a bit of an \"Oh well, it'll be fine in 2012\" attititude as if London is some kind of paradise with trees made of gold medals and grass made out of glory, instead of a city with quite a good bus service.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>10.29am </strong>And Britain's Jason Kenny wins his quarter-final in the men's sprint. In a faster time than Chris Hoy too, although he was pushed harder by his opponent than Hoy. Hugh Porter has a good look at the Dutch cyclist's thighs and gives his approval. Men aren't objects, Porter, I'm beginning to find this demeaning.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>10.33am: </strong>Despite 18 points from Yao Ming, Greece have beaten China 91-77 in the basketball. Greece will play Argentina in the quarters, while China face Lithuania.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>10.38am: </strong>That excitable chap in a boat brings us news from the sailing that <strong>Paul Goodison will win gold for Team In Your Face World in the Laser</strong> if he avoids finishing last in tomorrow's final race. \"The Onion ran a brilliant piece just before the Games started saying that the entire Chinese team were going to boycott the games in protest at human rights abuses at home and abroad and the state of the environment in and around Beijing,\" says Simon Martin. \"Do you think that today is the start of that boycott (albeit on a piecemeal basis)? You heard it here first.\"</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>10.40am: </strong>Kevin Mitchell has just filed a piece on America's main hope in the boxing, who only took up the sport to pay for his daughter's medical treatment. <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/wilder_carries_the_hopes_of_a.html\">Read it here</a>. <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/wilder_carries_the_hopes_of_a.html\">Or here</a>. But not here.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>10.45am: </strong>\"Re: male cyclists being objectified,\" writes Matt West. \"Well, Hoy is a blonde.\" He's more than that, Matt, you disgust me. Anyway, hot brunette Victoria Pendleton is up now I want to look at her.*</p> <p>*All sexism in this report is ironic.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>10.46am: </strong><strong>Victoria Pendleton wins the second leg of her quarter-final</strong>, which means we will see her in the semis. Well cycled.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>10.53am: </strong>\"Any chance you can give a few updates about Kiwi athletes. The complete incompetents at the NZ Herald have decided they don't want to live blog past 8pm even though our cyclists are racing for bronze tonight in the pursuit,\" says Nathan Green. 8pm?! We started this baby at 1.30am. \"No wonder I left to live in Cambodia. I guess we are still a colony so it's kind of your duty, right?\" Don't objectify yourself Nathan, you're much more than just a colony, you're a real country with your own heritage \u2013 you know, Ned Kelly, Wilpena Pound, Muriel's Wedding, Uluru all that stuff.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>10.56am: </strong> By the way, Britain's women are 14th in the synchronised swimming, while Australia's Meares and China's Guo join Victoria Pendleton in the semis of the women's sprint.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.59am: </strong>Croatia continues its campaign to bring down China from the inside as they complete a 16-4 thunking of the hosts in the men's water polo.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>11.05am: </strong><strong>Chris Hoy is through to the semis of the men's sprint</strong> after winning his second race of the quarter-finals. The race had to be restarted after they stop and have a bit of a flirt with each other. You're not allowed to stop, you see, and when they go again, Hoy just gets on with it and wins easily.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>11.08am: And Jason Kenny follows Hoy into the last four</strong> <em>just</em> squeezing past his French opponent to take a two race to zero lead.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>11.13am: </strong> The men's pursuit final is up any minute now (well, twenty minutes or so), in which Team Henman Hill will be going for gold.

To be fair, the fact that he can get away with saying it at all, shows some progress has been made.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>11.20am: </strong>Antipodean grudge match alert! It's a little-known backwater against a brash new world powerhouse, and as you'd expect the Kiwis are up at the start of the team pursuit.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>11.22am: </strong> The Aussies are way down, and have lost a man too. It looks like the Kiwis will take it with 1km to go.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>11.24am: </strong>And the Kiwis take it! Hugh Porter misleads us slightly by saying: \"It's New Zealand's first ever medal!\" Then adding: \"On the track\". And then adding \"In the men's team pursuit\".</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>11.26am: </strong>It's the men's pursuit next, Team Come On Tim! against Denmark and this should <em>should</em> be another gold for Britain.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>11.28am: </strong>Wggins and co are leading by one second after 1km. This could be a world record...</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>11.30am: </strong> And the British sail to a 1.5 second lead after 2km.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>11.31am: </strong>The Danes aren't cycling badly, but Britain are destroying them. Hugh Porter has even stopped talking about big thighs.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>11.32am: </strong><strong>Britain win the gold</strong> and smash the world record, beating the old mark by nearly two seconds. Disgustingly impressive stuff.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>11.35am: </strong>And China salvage some pride after their beatings today by the Croats as <strong>they take gold in the men's rings</strong> (yeah, don't even bother guttergums) at the gymnastics.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>11.39am: </strong>\"We're the best team out here,\" says Ed Clancy of GB's pursuit team, not unreasonably.

The commentators are surprised and slightly flustered after suggesting that she might break the 17-point watermark. Whoops.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>12.01pm: </strong>If gymnastics is not your thing, you will be delighted to learn of <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/18/first_impressions_can_be_decep.html\">Paul Doyle's</a> round-up of the first weekend of this season's Premier League action.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Gymnastics</strong>Romania's Steliana Nistor and Ukraine's Dariya Zogba follow with 15.575 and 14.875 respectively, so in an unsurprising turn of events, USA and China are still in the joint lead. Tweddle is up seventh out of eight.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>12.06pm: Team GB medal hopes</strong> Tweddle and the <strong>Equestrian Jumping </strong>team are Britain's hopes of yet more medals today. The jumping is starting soon, so we'll keep you informed of that.</p> <p>More medals, though? You're just getting greedy now.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>12.06pm: Gymnastics</strong> Our Beth puts on a strong perfomance and lands well. In fact according to the BBC's screaming hyperbole department, that was THE HARDEST ROUTINE THE WORLD EVER HAS SEEN.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>12.12pm </strong>All this waiting is agonising. Are they still using abacuses?</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>12.13pm: </strong>That may well have been the greatest performance in the history of jumping between bars of different heights, but sadly the BBC are not in charge of the judging. Beth scores 16.625, which is only good enough for fourth.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>12.17pm: Fourth for Team GB</strong> That's very tough for Beth; China's Yilin Yang was just ahead with 16.650. Also disappointment for headline writers up and down the nations who have seen their hilarious Tweddle/medal combinations rendered useless.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>12.20pm: Athletics </strong>The fallout from Liu Xiang's shock withdrawal in the hurdles continues. One of China's leading newsreaders collapsed in tears when she announced the terrible news. From a British perspective, the only real comparison can be the dark cloud that descended on the nation when Tim Henman was knocked out in the first round in Athens.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>12.26pm </strong>Still, China have the baseball coming up so that should lift their spirits. They'll be taking on....oh. The US.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>12.29pm: Gymnastics</strong> Plucky Beth Tweddle: \"I gave it my all, I'm gutted. The routine was 100 per cent, but this time last week I was pleased just to be in the final. My dismount was the problem; I came out too late and to be honest I thought I was going to be flat on my face. But I gave it my all and I made one dream, which was to make an Olympic final.\"</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>12.34pm </strong>Beth says she will not retire, contrary to an earlier statement from the BBC. The Beeb were also wrong with their prediction that the equestrian jumping final will be on today. My money (and that of the Olympic organising committee) is on this time tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.37pm: Anti-Beeb rant</strong> \"Thank Goodness that you are doing the hard work and watching the Gymnastics and letting us know the edited highlights,\" says Chris Riley. You don't know the half of it, Chris. </p> <p>\"Although enthusiasm and excitement is a valuable element to any sports commentary, that bloke on the BBC commentary, who was also a Blue Peter presenter and is an ex gymnast, takes his excitement to levels where after 5 minutes of watching, I want to ram pencils into my ears as hard as humanly possible to make the noise go away. Although I could just relocate my remote control.\"</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.38pm: Hockey</strong> Britain's women have only managed a 0-0 draw with the US, which rules them out of contention for a medal.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.44pm: Athletics</strong> If you prefer to watch your sport in a detached, approving manner while muttering \"Citius, altis, fortis, indeed\" at anyone in the vicinity, rather than screaming \"COME ON BRITAIN!!!\" at the TV, there are a few athletics finals coming up this afternoon. The <strong>Men's Long Jump</strong> is up first at 1.10pm, followed by the <strong>Men's Steeplechase </strong>an hour later.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.50pm: Athletics</strong> The <strong>Women's 800m</strong> is at 2.35pm and the <strong>Men's 400m Hurdles</strong> final wraps things up at 3pm.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> And if you're not into track and field, <strong>Diagnosis Murder</strong> is on right now. Mail me your approval if you would prefer an MBM on Dick Van Dyke's latest chuckle-filled murder mystery. My money's on the shifty-looking gardener.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.55pm: Hurdles</strong> Britain's Sarah Claxton has made the finals of the 100m hurdles, coming fourth in her semi-final. Bully for her.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>1.02pm:</strong> Stuart Lorkin reckons I'm <strong>in the pub</strong>. \"I have this image of you sitting with a bank of high-definition TV screens in front of you, flicking anxiously between the various red-button offerings to make sure you don't miss that critical table-tennis heat between Croatia and Peru. However, from reading your very welcome summary, I think you're actually just casually watching BBC1 in a local hostelry aren't you?\"</p> <p>I think you'll find I'm watching Diagnosis Murder in my local hostelry, Stuart.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>1.04pm: Athletics</strong> Marlon Devonish and that man Bolt are up now in the first heat of the second round of the 200m as is the USA's Shawn Crawford, who won gold in Athens in this event.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Devonish looks third.. maybe. It's a photo finish.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>1.08pm: </strong>Usain Bolt strolled home in first after stopping for a cup of tea and a wheeze on a Woodbine halfway through. Crawford followed Bolt's 20.29 with a second-placed 20.42.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> Marlon Devonish is knocked back to fourth by Kim Collins. That's tough, but he can hope to qualify as one of the best losers. <br><strong><br>Oh, the humanity.</strong> Gary Naylor ruminates on the fraigilty of Olympic dreams. \"Hurdling is brutal isn't it?\" he says. I guess so, Gary. \"Susanna Kallur has just hit the first hurdle and fallen out of an excellent medal chance. How many times has she jumped over a hurdle in her life? Tens of thousands of times. But when it mattered... Cruel.\"</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> For those of you following my jingoistic coverage of the women's 100m hurdles, Sweden's Susanna Kallur was one of the favourites for a medal but she fell and didn't finish her heat. Which is awful. But it did give our girl Sarah Claxton a shot at glory instead.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> Britain's Christian Malcom also finishes fourth in his 200m heat with a time of 20.30, That puts him in a strong position for the final. Tense times for his team-mate Marlon Devonish, who finished in 20.43. There will be four places for the fastest losers and Malcolm and Devonish are currently in first and third positions for those slots.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>1.24pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> Britain's Greg Rutherford fouls on his first jump. Curses.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>1.28pm: Men's 200m heats</strong>Antigua's Brendan Christian wins the third heat of the second round, but the good news for Marlon Devonish is that the fastest loser, Poland's Marcin Jedrunski, is behind him in 20.58.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.31pm: Men's 200m heats</strong> Ireland's Paul Hession is in the final heat here.....</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.32pm: Men's 200m heats</strong> ...and he makes the semi-finals with a really strong finish. Joining him will be Devonish, Malcolm, Usain Bolt, reigning champ Michael Crawford and Team USA's Wallace Spearmon, who looked uneasy as he came in second in his heat. Also a bunch of other fast chaps.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.41pm:</strong> In an unforeseen turn of events, the Guardian mainframe has been beset by technical issues.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.45pm: Gymnastics</strong> Unparallelled coverage of Beth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/18/tweddle\">Tweddle's </a>near miss in the uneven bars final earlier.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Women's Pole Vault</strong> One of the competitors has had her pole stolen. Well, she may have misplaced it, but that wouldn't be such a good story.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Women's 400m Hurdles</strong> An emotional Tasha Danvers of Team GB has just made the final. Having reached the same stage at the Sydney Games, she returns to an Olympic final after taking two years out to have a child.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: Women's 400m Hurdles</strong> Danvers ran in 54.31, second to the USA's Sheena Tosta in 54.07. She can take confidence from that display, but Colin Jackson reckons reaching the podium would be a tall order for her.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>2pm: Pole Vault</strong> Still trying to find out what happened with the missing pole here. In the <strong>Long Jump</strong> Greg Rutherford has not been doing so well. Hes currently in 11th place after two no-jumps.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>2.02pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> Rutherford's in the last chance saloon...</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>2.03pm: Men's Long Jump</strong> ....aaaagh. He gets the white flag, but 7.84m won't be enough to keep him in contention.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> In the interests of objectivity, I should let you know that this event is curently starting. Kenyans Ezekiel Kemboi and Richard Kipkemboi Mateelong are expected to make it nine wins in this event for their country.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> Sweden's Mustafa Mohamed is the non-Kenyan upstart here and he's making the early pace. Kemboi is the reigning Olympic champion in this event,</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>2.07pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> It's all very cagey at the moment with three laps to go. Mustafa still leading.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: Men's 3000m Steeplechase Final</strong> World Champion Brimin Kipruto wins for Kenya. That was a thrilling finish, Mahiedine Mekhissi threatened to take gold for France, but the Kenyans have this one locked down. Kemboi fell away in the end, but his compatriot Mateelong took bronze.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>2.23pm: </strong>The official Beijing Olympic Games website keeps crashing my computer. Which is inconvenient given that I am covering the Beijing Olympic Games.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>2.32pm: </strong>I have taken my powers of destruction to a new computer, so fingers crossed. The Beeb are reliving the joys of Athens 2004 with 800m Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes. And in a remarkable coincidence, the <strong>Women's 800m</strong> is about to start.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>2.34pm: Women's 800m </strong>Kenya's Pamela Jelimo is the name to watch here, says Steve Cram.

Jelimo only came to the event in April and she's now the Olympic champion. In fact, she is the <strong>first ever Kenyan female Olympic gold medallist</strong>. Oh, and she's just 18.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>2.46pm: Women's 800m</strong> Jelimo's winning time is 1:54.87mins, the fifth fastest ever and the junior world record. Dame Kelly is most impressed. Her Kenyan team-mate Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei is second in 1:56.07mins and Morocco's Hasna Benhassi takes bronze in 1:56.73.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: Women's 800m</strong>The charming Gavin Margetson has e-mailed to let me know how much superior our coverage to the BBC's. Modesty prevents me from publishing the text, but I must admit that when it comes to <strong>Equestrian Jumping</strong>, they were right and I (and my old nemesis the Beijing Olympic Games official website) was wrong. The USA have taken gold, Canada silver, Norway bronze and GB nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: </strong> My apologies: I checked the official schedule earlier and it was listed for tomorrow. Those sneaky devils at the BOGOW have now changed it, without owning up to their error. Rebranded Website is sent to the stand in the naughty corner, while the real culprit puts on its innocent face and produces an apple for teacher.</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>3.03pm:</strong> Anyhoo, Team GB didn't do so well and there is some actual sport happening in Beijing, without any pesky horses in the way.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> It's the <strong>Men's 400m Hurdles</strong> Final</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Great win for Angelo Taylor in 47.2secs.

That guarantees the Liverpudlian a bronze at least. The pundits are suggesting that he woud not want to win in such a manner but to be honest Price doesn't look too upset from where I'm sitting.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>3.20pm: </strong>Price was looking good at 3-1 up after the first round bu the Lithunanian looked in a lot of discomfort and clearly couldn't continue. </p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>South Africa</strong> have just won their first medal of the Games as Khotso Mokoena takes silver in the men's long jump.

That breaks her own record by 1cm, which she set last month in Monaco. </p> <p>John Davis lives in Brisbane, the poor lamb. \"As a merseysider living in Brisbane, I've obviously had to take a break from my thriving Ute Hubcap business to try and watch Dave Price, Unfortunately the Aussie media is treating any British success by closing their eyes, sticking their collective fingers in their ears shouting \"la la la la\" and pretending its not happening. Is he a genuine chance for gold ?\"</p> <p>If he's in the semis he's got a genuine chance Jim, but he's not one of the favourites.</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> Some results:</p> <p>In the <strong>Men's Long Jump</strong> Irving Saladino of Panama took gold with a best of 8.34m in the fourth round with Khotso Mokoena of South Africa second with 8.24m and Cuba's Ibrahim Camejo claiming bronze with 8.20m, just 4cm more than Rutherford's qualifying leap. </p> <p>In the <strong>Women's Pole Vault</strong> Yelena Isinbaeva took gold with a record leap of 5.05 metres at the third attempt.<br>Jennifer Stuczynski of the United States took silver with a leap of 4.80m, while Svetlana Feofanova took bronze with 4.75m on countback from compatriot Yulia Golubchikova.</p> <p>The US have beaten China in <strong>Baseball</strong> 9-1.
