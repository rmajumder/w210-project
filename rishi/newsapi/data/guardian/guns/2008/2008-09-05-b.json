  "<p>Rafael Ben\u00edtez believes this week's spate of managerial resignations will become the rule and not the exception of the Premier League as the new breed of wealthy club-owners demand instant returns on their mammoth investments.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager has come close to losing - and leaving - his post since Tom Hicks and George Gillett took control at Anfield and can identify with the reasons for Alan Curbishley's and Kevin Keegan's departures from West Ham and Newcastle because of his time with Valencia. Unlike Keegan and Curbishley, and in contrast to his time at the Mestalla Stadium, Ben\u00edtez retains a greater degree of control over transfers at his club, although the Americans' refusal to sanction an \u00a318m deal for Gareth Barry this summer shows there are limits to his authority.</p> <p>This week's arrival of the Abu Dhabi United Group at Manchester City has placed added pressure on Ben\u00edtez to qualify for the Champions League at a club that also demands a genuine challenge for the title this season. But, whether to meet financial or tournament targets, Ben\u00edtez believes the short-term ambitions of the new breed of owner will inevitably lead to a managerial cull.</p> <p>\"If the owners of the clubs keep on spending big, big money, then they will want more and more success. But how many teams can win the title? Just one,\" said Ben\u00edtez, whose club will be the next to fall under wealthy Arab control should Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum of Dubai finally persuade Hicks and Gillett to sell. \"So the rest of the teams who spend big money, the owners will realise they haven't won, so it could be more pressure and more problems for everyone. City will start the season under pressure from the first minute, but everyone knows you can't win every game. It will be a problem because four or five teams will spend big money, and only one can win.</p> <p>\"As a manager, you have to analyse things properly, because you aren't a fan. You can't just say what people want to hear. The Premier League is becoming more and more difficult because so many people are spending money. For us to qualify for the Champions League for five years in a row is important for a club of our stature. We want to win trophies, and to win the Premier League would be amazing. But it's not easy.\"</p> <p>Dubai's \u00a3400m offer for Liverpool remains on the Americans' table. Last week work on a proposed new stadium on Stanley Park was postponed due to the global economic crisis raising doubts over Hicks' and Gillett's ability to refinance their takeover next year.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez also suspects the growing trend for technical directors at English clubs, a system that prompted his departure from Valencia and lay behind Keegan's exit at Newcastle, will also weaken manager's positions. \"I have some experience in Spain with this system, and I think the relationship has to be good. That is the key,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>It is rare to come across a short-story collection from a new writer these days, never mind from one who is so good she gives you chills. Wigfall, in her first book, shows a confidence and control that allow her stories to cross continents, centuries and a huge range of voices without ever losing a pinpoint, world-in-the-palm-of-your-hand accuracy. She is an assured literary conjuror, giving life to notorious criminals (Bonnie and Clyde), socialites (the LA film world, 18th-century Parisians) and mute children (with Virgin Mary obsessions). At times she confuses, seeming to create bizarre worlds suffering plagues of rats and multiple baby-kidnappings, only to reveal by the end of the story that the unreality is in the head of the narrator; the shock of the realisation adds - tenfold - to the emotions. It also forces you to read her stories again, slowly, to be convinced of how brilliantly constructed and beautifully rendered they are. This debut collection is energisingly, awe-inspiringly, intimidatingly good.</p>",
  "<p><em>Ireland, near the north\u2013south border, 1981</em></p> <p>They'd stolen a march on the day. The sky was like dark glass, reluctant to let the light through. The only sound was the chudder of the van skirting the lough. The surface of the water was colourless. The hills slumped down on the far side like silhouettes of snoozing giants.</p> <p>Fergus yawned. It was still before five as they turned off up the mountain road. Uncle Tally chewed on nothing as the tyres lumbered over the ruts. Fergus cradled the flask of sweet black tea. There'd been no milk in the fridge that morning.</p> <p>\"Too early for you, huh?\" mocked Uncle Tally, changing gear.</p> <p>\"Too right,\" said Fergus. \"When I go running, it's not dark like this.\" His throat was furred up. The words came out stretched by a yawn. \"It's unnatural being up before the birds.\"</p> <p>They approached the border checkpoint and the van slowed. The soldier by the hut stood with a rifle but did not move. He was young-looking and pale, with freckles. He waved them on, tipping the butt of the gun, and they drove past without having to stop. Uncle Tally laughed. \"I could have a truckload of Semtex for all that wee squaddie cares,\" he said.</p> <p>Fergus grunted. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Deus would be delighted.\"</p> <p>Deus, Latin for \"God\", was the local nickname for a rumoured bomb-maker, said to be active thereabouts.</p> <p>\"So he would.\"</p> <p>\"Only you'd be going in the wrong direction. We\"re leaving the Troubles, Unk, not joining them.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally thumped the wheel. \"So we are. We\"re in the free state now. Free as a bloody bog-frog.\" They both laughed like clowns. Going over the border always had that effect. Without your knowing it, your jaw-bone would stiffen and adrenalin pump through your veins as the checkpoint approached. Then, when you were through, hilarity would erupt at the relief.</p> <p>The van turned up onto a steep road with grass growing up the middle. The gorse got yellower as they climbed, the sky brighter. \"The border. Even a nun would be nervous crossing it,\" suggested Fergus.</p> <p>\"And we'll be crossing back over it at the top.\"</p> <p>\"Will we?\"</p> <p>\"If you look at the map. You can see.\"</p> <p>Fergus opened the map and saw the dotted grey line, almost invisible, meandering across Ireland's north, but leaving a thin tract of land to the west that was Donegal. \"The most northern bit of Ireland's in the south,\" he quoted.</p> <p>\"One day, one day . . .\" Uncle Tally muttered like a mantra.</p> <p>\"One day what?\"</p> <p>\"One day the only border will be the sea and the only thing guarding it the dunes and the only people living in it Republicans. One day, Fergus.\"</p> <p>\"Where will the Loyalists go, so?\"</p> <p>\"They'll be beamed to outer space, warp factor five.\" Uncle Tally drove round a loop of road, heading back to where the light was growing on the horizon. \"Lucky them. Now, here's the spot to park, Fergus. Get cracking. The JCB crew will be down on us before you know.\" He pulled up and they got out the shovels and bags from the back and walked over a track for a hundred yards. On either side, brown grass sprouted out of black, wet earth, and bright green weeds spread like mildew over the soggier areas. The first skylark of the day darted from cover. Fergus approached the JCB, which was still, abandoned. Earth was churned up all around it, the leftover diggings from the day before. But \"earth\" was the wrong word. It was turf, rich foaming peat, made from the things that had lived here in millennia gone by and pressed by time into a magic frieze of the past. You could dig up wood from primeval forests, find resin with insects of another age frozen in it. And what you dug up you could burn as fuel.</p> <p>And, as his da said, there was nothing like the smell of the turf on a hearth to bring comfort in a dark world.</p> <p>A pink tint grew on the horizon as they dug and filled the bags with uncut clumps. Dawn intensified. The sky was clear and close up here, the mind uncluttered. Uncle Tally grunted as he shovelled, his taut, fit frame enjoying the work. Fergus held the bags open for him and then they swapped over. They'd sell the bags for ninety pence and Fergus was promised a cut of thirty per cent. But the JCB crew would be arriving soon and they'd have to be well gone by then.</p> <p>A cry made Fergus swivel round. It was only a wild kid with a creamy coat, bleating at its mother fifty yards away or more.</p> <p>\"Get the flask, Fergus,\" Uncle Tally said. \"I'm parched. I'd a skinful last night.\"</p> <p>\"Did you?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. Your da and Pad McGuire. They came down to Finicule's for one. And you know how it is.\"</p> <p>\"Were you singing, Unk?\"</p> <p>\"We were so far gone we were singing \"Three Blind Mice\". I ask you. And your da couldn't get beyond See how they run. And it was only ten 't.\"</p> <p>\"I don't believe you.\"</p> <p>\"OK. Maybe not quite so wild.\"</p> <p>Fergus went to the van and found the flask of tea. He brought it over and they strolled down to an outcrop of rock and shared a capful. The rim of the sun came over the mountain. A wind picked up.</p> <p>\"Christ, it's quiet up here,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"It'd be a strange place to live.\"</p> <p>\"You'd have to be a hermit.\"</p> <p>\"There'd be nothing to do but pray,\" said Fergus.</p> <p>\"Aye. You'd have plenary indulgences made for every last sinner by the time you died yourself. And then you'd be whisked up straight to heaven.\"</p> <p>\"You should move up here.\"</p> <p>\"I would too. Only it's a bit far.\"</p> <p>\"Far from where?\"</p> <p>\"The nearest bar.\"</p> <p>\"You could make your own distillery, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"But what would you distil?\"</p> <p>\"The prayers. What else?\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally clipped his ear. \"You\"re too sharp, Fergus McCann. Pass me the flask.\"</p> <p>After tea, they filled another ten bags. When there was no loosened turf left, Uncle Tally left the shovel prodded into the earth and they began to load the bags into the van.</p> <p>\"Not a bad haul.\"</p> <p>Fergus wandered off to the other side of the JCB. He watched the skyline and listened to morning getting under way. There was a hum of insects now, small movements of birds and, far off from the floor of the valley, the sound of the odd truck. The sun was up, white and smooth behind a whisper of cloud. The track led back to the road, and the road truncated the bog-land and headed straight to the horizon. Up here was borderland too. He was looking back into the North, but behind him was the Republic.</p> <p>\"Ferg, shake a leg,\" called Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"Will we do another few bags?\"</p> <p>\"What time is it?\"</p> <p>Fergus looked at the watch he was minding for his older brother, Joe. \"Not seven yet.\"</p> <p>\"OK. But we've to make a fresh cut of it.\"</p> <p>A shovel apiece, they scrambled into the cut the JCB had made last thing the day before.</p> <p>\"You work that end, I'll work this. You've to ram the sharp side in straight and up in a line.\" Uncle Tally showed him how. \"Then down along.\"</p> <p>\"Like a grid?\"</p> <p>\"That's it. Once you've the first line out, it's easier.\"</p> <p>It was slower going than working with the JCB's leavings. But the smell of the fresh peat was clean and the springy consistency strangely satisfying to cut into.</p> <p>Fergus finished a good-sized grid and worked down along the cut, away from his uncle.</p> <p>\"Hiyack,\" he shouted as he brought the shovel hard down at a fresh angle. One inch from the wall of brown turf he froze. A foreign colour stopped him, a dull, tawny glint. He let the shovel topple at his side and his eyes blinked. Then he stretched out a hand to touch the surface. Maybe it was a trick of the light. Or a stone. Or\u2014</p> <p>Whatever it was was hard.</p> <p>He spat on his forefinger and wiped it. It gleamed a little, like a smile.</p> <p>A coin's edge. That was it.</p> <p>Excited, he spat on his fingertips and rubbed it again.</p> <p>No. It was bigger. A coil of metal, fashioned like a plait, chased itself round.</p> <p>And as he stared, fingers, four of them, appeared below it. They were brown and lined and tiny. The skin on them was too big for the bones, drooping slightly. They reminded him of his mother's, when she wore the extra-large Marigold rubber gloves.</p> <p>They were beautiful, poised like a pianist's getting ready to play, but only half the size of his own.</p> <p>\"Jesus.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally, hard at work down his end of the cut, didn't hear.</p> <p>\"Unk. Jesus, Unk. Come here.\"</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>\"There's something here. In the earth. A hand.\"</p> <p>\"What d\"you mean a hand?\"</p> <p>\"A tiny hand. And a bangle on it. And some cloth stuff.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally hee-hawed. \"Hey, Ferg. It's June. Not the first of bloody April.\"</p> <p>But he came and looked where Fergus pointed.</p> <p>They stood in silence, staring at the wall of turf.</p> <p>\"Shit,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>It was like a mural.</p> <p>The legs were missing.</p> <p>The side of a twisted torso covered in brown-stained cloth was visible above the hand. The shoulders, neck and head disappeared into the earth behind.</p> <p>\"It's a body,\" said Uncle Tally.</p> <p>\"Dead right it's a body,\" said Fergus.</p> <p>\"You could say dead again.\"</p> <p>\"Is it the Provos, Unk?\"</p> <p>\"The Provos?\"</p> <p>\"Is it somebody they killed?\"</p> <p>\"Why would they bother burying a child like that?\"</p> <p>Fergus realized. Of course. The tiny hand: the body of a child. \"Maybe it was an execution. A child of a traitor. Somebody who'd done the Cause a bad turn.\"</p> <p>\"Nah. That's not the Provos\" style.\" Uncle Tally put his shovel so it matched up against the torso's length.</p> <p>\"It's a girl, Unk,\" Fergus gasped. \"A poor wee girl. Look at the bangle and the dress on her.\"</p> <p>\"Mother of mercy. Let's get out of here.\"</p> <p>\"But Unk\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Look, she's dead, right?\"</p> <p>\"I know she's dead, but\u2014\"</p> <p>\"Yeah. And probably murdered, right?\"</p> <p>\"Murdered?\"</p> <p>\"So if we report it, we\"re done for the turf-cutting.\"</p> <p>\"But, Unk, if the JCB crew arrive, they'll just cut her up. Into ribbons. It's a miracle they stopped when they did. And that I saw her.\"</p> <p>\"Fergus, nobody's going to bring that child back to life.\"</p> <p>A clod of earth fell from the cut as he said that and an elbow appeared, small and leathered.</p> <p>\"Jesus Mary.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, Unk. Please.\"</p> <p>\"What d\"you want me to do, Fergus?\"</p> <p>\"Dunno.\"</p> <p>They stood still in the cut. The kid bleated from far away like it was lost. Fergus felt a tear forming. Furious, he bit his lip.</p> <p>\"It's a girl like our Theresa or Cath, Unk. We can't just leave her to get mashed up by the JCB. It's easy to miss her. She's gone all brown with being in the bog.\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally sighed. \"We\"re in the Republic, I suppose. It'd be the Gardai I'd tell. Not the RUC.\" He picked up Fergus's shovel. \"I'm heading away back along the road and over to Inchquin. If the JCB comes, you were up here bird-watching.\"</p> <p>\"Bird-watching?\"</p> <p>\"And you made a covert of the cut and just happened to spot this. Got it?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"I'm away to get the guards.\"</p> <p>\"OK.\"</p> <p>They loaded the shovels and last two bags of peat into the back of the van. Uncle Tally got in and wound down the window.</p> <p>\"And Fergus?\" he said.</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>\"Don't touch her. Don't try to dig her out any more.\"</p> <p>\"Why not?\"</p> <p>\"Fingerprints. They'll think you\"re the murderer, stupid.\"</p> <p>\"Ha-ha.\"</p> <p>\"I'm serious.\"</p> <p>\"OK, Unk.\"</p> <p>\"And take this.\"</p> <p>\"What?\"</p> <p>Uncle Tally rooted in the glove compartment and handed Fergus some binoculars. \"Bird-watching. Right?\"</p> <p>\"Right.\"</p> <p>\"Stay away from that body.\"</p> <p>The van drove away. Fergus went back to the cut and waited above it, trying out the views through the binoculars. Half the time he stared at the magnified brown body in the bog. He could see lines on the finger-pads, as if the small girl had been alive yesterday. They looped and spooled like rivers. Some property of the bog had accentuated them. Then he noticed a grey-white bone, sticking out a fraction. It was where the JCB had cut through her lower leg. His stomach somersaulted. He whisked round and examined the view of the plain below, a great swath of County Fermanagh. But however hard he peered, he could have sworn the child behind him was staring into his back, her eyes needling his shoulder blades. He shrugged and pinched himself and looked through the binoculars to the far horizon. From up here, on the peaceful mountain, it was hard to believe that such unquiet existed amongst the people living on the plain below. Curls of smoke, swaying trees, cars flashing blue and red along the tarmac roads, all moved in silence. A sparrowhawk glided across his field of vision, swimming on a current of air, wavering. Then it swooped to earth and vanished from view. He crawled forward on the springy earth and lay flat on his stomach, spying down on the world. Behind him, the grass sighed with the sound of waiting.</p> <p>\u2022 (c) Siobhan Down. Bog Child is published by <a href=\"http://www.kidsatrandomhouse.co.uk\">Random House</a></p>",
  "<p><em>A rocket, launched yesterday from a private site in northern China, is missing along with its crew of five. Yesterday the Internet was alive with rumours of a secret manned space mission. Today Nasa and the Russian Federal Space Agency both confirmed that a rocket did take off but denied it was theirs. The rocket entered high orbit and then disappeared into \"deep space\". No manned rocket has left Earth's orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972.</em></p> <p>Mum, Dad \u2013 if you're listening \u2013 you know I said I was going to the South Lakeland Outdoor Activity Centre with the school? To be completely honest, I'm not exactly in the Lake District. To be completely honest, I'm more sort of in space. I'm on this rocket, the Infinite Possibility. I'm about two hundred thousand miles above the surface of the Earth. I'm allright . . . ish. I know I've got some explaining to do. This is me doing it. I lied about my age. I sort of gave the impression I was about thirty. Obviously I'm more sort of thirteen-ish. On my next birthday. To be fair, everyone lies about their age. Adults pretend to be younger. Teenagers pretend to be older. Children wish they were grownups. Grownups wish they were children.</p> <p>It's not like I had to try very hard, is it? Everyone always thinks I'm older than I really am, just because I'm tall. In St Joan of Arc Primary the teachers seemed to think that height and age were the same thing. If you were taller than someone, you must be older than them. If you were tall and you made a mistake \u2013 even if it was only your first day \u2013 you got, \"You should know better, big lad like you.\" Why, by the way? Why should a big lad know better just because he's big? King Kong's a big lad. Would he know the way to the toilet block on his first day at school? When no one had told him? No, I don't think he would. Anyway a few hours back the Infinite Possibility was supposed to complete a routine manoeuvre and basically it didn't. It rolled out of orbit, wrecking all the communication equipment, and now we're very lost in space. </p> <p>I've got this mobile phone with me \u2013 because it had pictures of home on it. It's got an audio-diary function. That's what I'm talking into now. Unless you get this message you won't know about this because we're on a secret mission. They already told us that if it goes wrong they're going to deny all knowledge of it. And us. There's five of us on board. The others are all asleep. Can you believe that, by the way? We're in a rocket, spinning hopelessly out of control and into Forever, and what is their chosen course of action? A nap. </p> <p>When we got the manoeuvre just slightly wrong \u2013 just slightly enough to make us completely doomed \u2013 they all screamed for about an hour and then they dozed off. I can't sleep. I can't get comfortable in sleeping bags because they're always too small for me. Plus I think if I stay awake I might have an idea. And save us all. That's why I'm recording this on my Draxphone. If I do get home, I'm going to give it to you and then you'll understand how I ended up in deep space when I said I was going pond dipping in the Lake District. </p> <p>If you are listening to this though, and you are not my mum and dad, you are probably a pointy-headed, ninety-legged, sucker-footed alien, in which case, can I just say, \"Hello, I come in peace. And, if you happen to have the technology, would you mind posting this to: Mr and Mrs Digby \u2013 23, Glenarm Close, Bootle, Liverpool 22, England, The Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, et cetera. If it's not too much trouble.\"</p> <p>The slightly worrying thing is that I am sort of enjoying this. Being doomed is Not Good. But being weightless is Outstanding. Every time I lean forward I do a perfect somersault. When I stretch my arms in the air I levitate. Back on Earth my only special skills are being above average in maths and height. Up here I've got so many skills I'm practically a Power Ranger. Then there's the stars. </p> <p>On Earth, our house is right next to the New Strand Shopping Centre. The multi-storey blots out most of the sky. The only stars I ever really noticed were the ones on the \"It's Your Solar System\" glow-in-the-dark mobile I got when I was nine. And the only reason I noticed them was that they kept getting tangled in my hair. Mobiles do not make good presents for persons of above average height. </p> <p>The stars look different from here. There's a lot more of them, for one thing. Big swirls and knots and clouds of them, so bright they hurt to look at. When you're in it, space looks like the biggest firework display ever \u2013 except it's on pause. It looks like freeze-frame fireworks. Even if you're Completely Doomed, you've got to be impressed. </p> <p>The only bad thing about the view is that it doesn't include Earth. We haven't seen it since we rolled out of orbit. I said to the others, \"Well, it must be somewhere. We're probably just facing the wrong way. We'll find it. Definitely.\" But that didn't seem to calm them down. One of them \u2013 Samson Two \u2013 drew me a diagram to prove that even if we were facing the wrong way we should still be able to see it. I said, \"So what are you saying? That we've fallen into some magic wormhole and come out on the other side of the universe?\" </p> <p>\"Possibly.\" </p> <p>\"That the whole Earth just vanished? That it's gone?\" </p> <p>\"Possibly.\" </p> <p>They all screamed until they wore themselves out, and then they went to sleep. At least sleep uses less oxygen.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing you find out when yer dog learns to talk is that dogs don't got nothing much to say. </p> <p>About anything. </p> <p>\"Need a poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"Shut up, Manchee.\" </p> <p>\"Poo. Poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"I said shut it.\" </p> <p>We're walking across the wild fields south-east of town, those ones that slope down to the river and head on towards the swamp. Ben's sent me to pick him some swamp apples and he's made me take Manchee with me, even tho we all know Cillian only bought him to stay on Mayor Prentiss's good side and so suddenly here's this brand new dog as a present for my birthday last year when I never said I wanted any dog, that what I said I wanted was for Cillian to finally fix the fissionbike so I wouldn't have to walk every forsaken place in this stupid town, but oh, no, happy birthday, Todd, here's a brand new puppy, Todd, and even tho you don't want him, even tho you never asked for him, guess who has to feed him and train him and wash him and take him for walks and listen to him jabber now he's got old enough for the talking germ to set his mouth moving? Guess who? </p> <p>\"Poo,\" Manchee barks quietly to himself. \"Poo, poo, poo.\" </p> <p>\"Just have yer stupid poo and quit yapping about it.\" </p> <p>I take a switch of grass from beside the trail and I swat after him with it. I don't reach him, I don't mean to reach him, but he just laughs his little barking laugh and carries on down the trail. I follow after him, switching the switch against the grass on either side, squinting from the sun, try- ing not to think about nothing at all. </p> <p>We don't need apples from the swamp, truth to tell. Ben can buy them at Mr Phelps's store if he really wants them. Also true: going to the swamp to pick a few apples is not a job for a man cuz men are never allowed to be so idle. Now, I won't officially become a man for thirty more days. I've lived twelve years of thirteen long months each and another twelve months besides, all of which living means I'm still one month away from the big birthday. The plans are being planned, the preparayshuns prepared, it will be a party, I guess, tho I'm starting to get some strange pictures about it, all dark and too bright at the same time, but nevertheless I will become a man and picking apples in the swamp is not a job for a man or even an almost-man. </p> <p>But Ben knows he can ask me to go and he knows I'll say yes to going because the swamp is the only place any- where near Prentisstown where you can have half a break from all the Noise that men spill outta theirselves, all their clamour and clatter that never lets up, even when they sleep, men and the thoughts they don't know they think even when everyone can hear. Men and their Noise. I don't know how they do it, how they stand each other. </p> <p>Men are Noisy creachers. </p> <p>\"Squirrel!\" </p> <p>Manchee shouts and off he goes, jumping off the trail, no matter how loud I yell after him, and off I have to go, too, across the (I look round to make sure I'm alone) goddamfields cuz Cillian'll have a fit if Manchee falls down some goddamsnake hole and of course it'll be my own goddamfault even tho I never wanted the goddamdog in the goddamfirst place. </p> <p>\"Manchee! Get back here!\" </p> <p>\"Squirrel!\" </p> <p>I have to kick my way thru the grass, getting grublets stuck to my shoes. One smashes as I kick it off, leaving a green smear across my trainers, which I know from experi- ence ain't coming out. \"Manchee!\" I rage. </p> <p>\"Squirrel! Squirrel! Squirrel!\" </p> <p>He's barking round the tree and the squirrel's skittering back and forth on the tree trunk, taunting him. Come on, Whirler dog, says its Noise. Come on, come get, come on, come get. Whirler Whirler Whirler. </p> <p>\"Squirrel, Todd! Squirrel!\" </p> <p>Goddam, animals are stupid. </p> <p>I grab Manchee by the collar and hit him hard across his back leg. \"Ow, Todd? Ow?\" I hit him again. And again. \"Ow? Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Come on,\" I say, my own Noise raging so loud I can barely hear myself think, which is something I'm about to regret, you watch. </p> <p>Whirler boy, Whirler boy, thinks the squirrel at me. Come get, Whirler boy. </p> <p>\"You can eff off, too,\" I say, except I don't say \"eff\", I say what \"eff\" stands for. </p> <p>And I really, really shoulda looked round again. </p> <p>Cuz here's Aaron, right here, rising outta the grass from nowhere, rising up and smacking me cross the face, scratching my lip with his big ring, then bringing his hand back the other way, closed as a fist, catching my cheekbone but at least missing my nose because I'm falling into the grass, trying to fall away from his punch, and I let go of Manchee's collar and off he runs back to the squirrel, barking his head off, the traitor, and I hit the grass with my knees and my hands, getting grublet stains all over everything. </p> <p>And I stay there, on the ground, breathing. </p> <p>Aaron stands over me, his Noise coming at me in fragments of scripture and of his next sermon and Language, young Todd and the finding of a sacrifice and the saint chooses his path and God hears and the wash of pictures that's in everyone's Noise, of things familiar and glancing flashes of\u2013 </p> <p>What? What the forsaken\u2013? </p> <p>But up flies a loud bit of his sermon to block it out and I look up into his eyes and suddenly I don't wanna know. I can already taste the blood where his ring cut my lip and I don't wanna know. He never comes out here, men never do, they have their reasons, men do, and it's just me and my dog only ever but here he is and I don't don't don't wanna know. </p> <p>He smiles down at me, thru that beard of his, smiles down at me in the grass. </p> <p>A smiling fist. </p> <p>\"Language, young Todd,\" he says, \"binds us like prisoners on a chain. Haven't you learned anything from yer church, boy?\" And then he says his most familiar preaching. \"If one of us falls, we all fall.\" </p> <p>Yes, Aaron, I think. </p> <p>\"With yer mouth, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, Aaron,\" I say. </p> <p>\"And the effs?\" he says. \"And the geedees? Because don't think I didn't hear them as well. Your Noise reveals you. Reveals us all.\" </p> <p>Not all, I think, but at the same time I say, \"Sorry, Aaron.\" He leans down to me, his lips close to my face, and I can smell the breath that comes outta his mouth, smell the weight of it, like fingers grabbing for me. \"God hears,\" he whispers. \"God hears.\" </p> <p>And he raises a hand again and I flinch and he laughs and then he's gone, like that, heading back towards the town, taking his Noise with him. </p> <p>I'm shaking from the charge to my blood at being hit, shaking from being so fired up and so surprised and so angry and so much hating this town and the men in it that it takes me a while till I can get up and go get my dog again. What was he effing doing out here anyway? I think and I'm so hacked off, still so raging with anger and hate (and fear, yes, fear, shut up) that I don't even look round to see if Aaron heard my Noise. I don't look round. I don't look round. And then I do look round and I go and get my dog. </p> <p>\"Aaron, Todd? Aaron?\" </p> <p>\"Don't say that name again, Manchee.\" </p> <p>\"Bleeding, Todd. Todd? Todd? Todd? Bleeding?\" </p> <p>\"I know. Shut up.\" </p> <p>\"Whirler,\" he says, as if it don't mean nothing, his head as empty as the sky. </p> <p>I smack his rump. \"Don't say that neither.\" </p> <p>\"Ow? Todd?\" </p> <p>We keep on walking, staying clear of the river on our left. It runs down thru a series of gulches at the east of town, starting way up to the north past our farm and coming down the side of the town till it flattens out into a marshy part that eventually becomes the swamp. You have to avoid the river and especially that marshy part before the swamp trees start cuz that's where the crocs live, easily big enough to kill an almost-man and his dog. The sails on their backs look just like a row of rushes and if you get too close, WHOOM! \u2013 outta the water they come, flying at you with their claws grasping and their mouths snapping and you pretty much ain't got no chance at all then. </p> <p>We get ourselves down past the marshy part and I try to take in the swamp quiet as it approaches. There's nothing to see down here no more, really, which is why men don't come. And the smell, too, I don't pretend it don't smell, but it don't smell nearly so bad as men make out. They're smelling their memories, they are, they're not smelling what's really here, they're smelling it like it was then. All the dead things. Spacks and men had different ideas for burial. Spacks just used the swamp, threw their dead right into the water, let 'em sink, which was fine cuz they were suited for swamp burial, I guess. That's what Ben says. Water and muck and Spackle skin worked fine together, didn't poison nothing, just made the swamp richer, like men do to soil. </p> <p>Then suddenly, of course, there were a whole lot more spacks to bury than normal, too many for even a swamp this big to swallow, and it's a ruddy big swamp, too. And then there were no live spacks at all, were there? Just spack bodies in heaps, piling up in the swamp and rotting and stinking and it took a long time for the swamp to become swamp again and not just a mess of flies and smells and who knows what extra germs they'd kept saved up for us. </p> <p>I was born into all that, all that mess, the over-crowded swamp and the over-crowded sematary and the not- crowded-enough town, so I don't remember nothing, don't remember a world without Noise. My pa died of sickness before I was born and then my ma died, of course, no sur- prises there. Ben and Cillian took me in, raised me. Ben says my ma was the last of the women but everyone says that about everyone's ma. Ben may not be lying, he believes it's true, but who knows? </p> <p>I am the youngest of the whole town, tho. I used to come out and throw rocks at field crows with Reg Oliver (seven months and 8 days older) and Liam Smith (four months and 29 days older) and Seb Mundy who was next youngest to me, three months and a day older, but even he don't talk to me no more now that he's a man. </p> <p>No boys do once they turn thirteen. </p> <p>Which is how it goes in Prentisstown. Boys become men and they go to their men-only meetings to talk about who knows what and boys most definitely ain't allowed and if yer the last boy in town, you just have to wait, all by yerself. </p> <p>Well, you and a dog you don't want. </p> <p>But never mind, here's the swamp and in we go, sticking to the paths that take us round and over the worst of the water, weaving our way round the big, bulby trees that grow up and outta the bog to the needly roof, metres and metres up. The air's thick and it's dark and it's heavy, but it's not a frightening kind of thick and dark and heavy. There's lots of life here, loads of it, just ignoring the town as you please, birds and green snakes and frogs and kivits and both kinds of squirrel and (I promise you) a cassor or two and sure there's red snakes to watch out for but even tho it's dark, there's slashes of light that come down from holes in the roof and if you ask me, which you may not be, I grant you that, to me the swamp's like one big, comfy, not very Noisy room. Dark but living, living but friendly, friendly but not grasping. </p> <p>Manchee lifts his leg on practically everything till he must be running outta pee and then he heads off under a bush, burbling to himself, finding a place to do his other business, I guess. </p> <p>But the swamp don't mind. How could it? It's all just life, going over itself, returning and cycling and eating itself to grow. I mean, it's not that it's not Noisy here. Sure it is, there's no escaping Noise, not nowhere at all, but it's qui- eter than the town. The loud is a different kind of loud, because swamp loud is just curiosity, creachers figuring out who you are and if yer a threat. Whereas the town knows all about you already and wants to know more and wants to beat you with what it knows till how can you have any of yerself left at all? </p> <p>Swamp Noise, tho, swamp Noise is just the birds all thinking their worrisome little birdie thoughts. Where's food? Where's home? Where's my safety? And the waxy squirrels, which are all little punks, teasing you if they see you, teasing themselves if they don't, and the rusty squirrels, which are like dumb little kids, and some- times there's swamp foxes out in the leaves who you can hear faking their Noise to sound like the squirrels they eat and even less often there are mavens singing their weird maven songs and once I swear I saw a cassor running away on two long legs but Ben says I didn't, says the cassors are long gone from the swamp. </p> <p>I don't know. I believe me. </p> <p>Manchee comes outta the bushes and sits down next to me cuz I've stopped right there in the middle of a trail. He looks around to see what I might be seeing and then he says, \"Good poo, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sure it was, Manchee.\" </p> <p>I'd better not get another ruddy dog when my birthday comes. What I want this year is a hunting knife like the one Ben carries on the back of his belt. Now that's a present for a man. </p> <p>\"Poo,\" Manchee says quietly. </p> <p>On we walk. The main bunch of apple trees are a little ways into the swamp, down a few paths and over a fallen log that Manchee always needs help over. When we get there, I pick him up around his stomach and lift him to the top. Even tho he knows what I'm doing, he still kicks his legs all over the place like a falling spider, making a fuss for no reason at all. </p> <p>\"Hold still, you gonk!\" </p> <p>\"Down, down, down!\" he yelps, scrabbling away at the air. </p> <p>\"Idiot dog.\" </p> <p>I plop him on top the log and climb up myself. We both jump down to the other side, Manchee barking \"Jump!\" as he lands and keeping on barking \"Jump!\" as he runs off. </p> <p>The leap over the log is where the dark of the swamp really starts and the first thing you see are the old Spackle buildings, leaning out towards you from shadow, looking like melting blobs of tan-coloured ice cream except hut-sized. No one knows or can remember what they were ever sposed to be but best guess by Ben, who's a best guess kinda guy, is that they had something to do with burying their dead. Maybe even some kind of church, even tho the spacks didn't have no kind of religion anyone from Prentisstown could reckernize. </p> <p>I keep a wide distance from them and go into the little grove of wild apple trees. The apples are ripe, nearly black, almost edible, as Cillian would say. I pick one off the trunk and take a bite, the juice dribbling down my chin. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" </p> <p>\"What, Manchee?\" I take out the plastic bag I've got folded in my back pocket and start filling it with apples. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" he barks again and this time I notice how he's barking it and I turn and he's pointed at the Spackle build- ings and his fur's all ridged up on his back and his ears are flicking all over the place. </p> <p>I stand up straight. \"What is it, boy?\" </p> <p>He's growling now, his lips pulled back over his teeth. I feel the charge in my blood again. \"Is it a croc?\" I say. </p> <p>\"Quiet, Todd,\" Manchee growls. </p> <p>\"But what is it?\" </p> <p>\"Is quiet, Todd.\" He lets out a little bark and it's a real bark, a real dog bark that means nothing but \"Bark!\" and my body electricity goes up a bit, like charges are going to start leaping outta my skin. \"Listen,\" he growls. </p> <p>And so I listen. </p> <p>And I listen. </p> <p>And I turn my head a little and I listen some more. </p> <p>There's a hole in the Noise. </p> <p>Which can't be. </p> <p>It's weird, it is, out there, hiding somewhere, in the trees or somewhere outta sight, a spot where your ears and your mind are telling you there's no Noise. It's like a shape you can't see except by how everything else around it is touch- ing it. Like water in the shape of a cup, but with no cup. It's a hole and everything that falls into it stops being Noise, stops being anything, just stops altogether. It's not like the quiet of the swamp, which is never quiet obviously, just less Noisy. But this, this is a shape, a shape of nothing, a hole where all Noise stops. </p> <p>Which is impossible. </p> <p>There ain't nothing but Noise in this world, nothing but the constant thoughts of men and things coming at you and at you and at you, ever since the spacks released the Noise germ during the war, the germ that killed half the men and every single woman, my ma not excepted, the germ that drove the rest of the men mad, the germ that spelled the end for all Spackle once men's madness picked up a gun. </p> <p>\"Todd?\" Manchee's spooked, I can hear it. \"What, Todd? </p> <p>What's it, Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Can you smell anything?\" </p> <p>\"Just smell quiet, Todd,\" he barks, then he starts barking louder, \"Quiet! Quiet!\" </p> <p>And then, somewhere around the spack buildings, the quiet moves. </p> <p>My blood-charge leaps so hard it about knocks me over. Manchee yelps in a circle around me, barking and barking, making me double-spooked, and so I smack him on the rump again (\"Ow, Todd?\") to make myself calm down. \"There's no such thing as holes,\" I say. \"No such thing as nothing. So it's gotta be a something, don't it?\" </p> <p>\"Something, Todd,\" Manchee barks. </p> <p>\"Can you hear where it went?\" </p> <p>\"It's quiet, Todd.\" </p> <p>\"You know what I mean.\" </p> <p>Manchee sniffs the air and takes one step, two, then more towards the Spackle buildings. I guess we're looking for it, then. I start walking all slow-like up to the biggest of the melty ice cream scoops. I stay outta the way of anything that might be looking out the little bendy triangle doorway. Manchee's sniffing at the door frame but he's not growling so I take a deep breath and I look inside. </p> <p>It's dead empty. The ceiling rises up to a point about another length of me above my head. Floor's dirt, swamp plants growing in it now, vines and suchlike, but nothing else. Which is to say no real nothing, no hole, and no telling what mighta been here before. </p> <p>It's stupid but I gotta say it. </p> <p>I'm wondering if the Spackle are back. </p> <p>But that's impossible. </p> <p>But a hole in the Noise is impossible. </p> <p>So something impossible has to be true. </p> <p>I can hear Manchee snuffling around again outside so I creep out and I go to the second scoop. There's writing on the outside of this one, the only written words anyone's ever seen in the spack language. The only words they ever saw fit to write down, I guess. The letters are spack letters, but Ben says they make the sound es'Paqili or suchlike, es'Paqili, the Spackle, \"spacks\" if you wanna spit it, which since what happened happened is what everyone does. Means \"The People\". </p> <p>There's nothing in the second scoop neither. I step back out into the swamp and I listen again. I put my head down and I listen and I reach with the hearing parts of my brain and I listen there, too, and I listen and listen. </p> <p>I listen. </p> <p>\"Quiet! Quiet!\" Manchee barks, twice real fast and peels off running again, towards the last scoop. I take off after him, running myself, my blood charging, cuz that's where it is, that's where the hole in the Noise is. I can hear it. </p> <p>Well, I can't hearit, that's the whole point, but when I run towards it the emptiness of it is touching my chest and the stillness of it pulls at me and there's so much quiet in it, no, not quiet, silence, so much unbelievable silence that I start to feel really torn up, like I'm about to lose the most valuable thing ever, like there it is, a death, and I'm running and my eyes are watering and my chest is just crushing and there's no one to see but I still mind and my eyes start crying, they start crying, they start effing crying, and I stop for a minute and I bend over and Jesus H Dammit, you can just shut up right now, but I waste a whole stupid minute, just a whole stinking, stupid minute bent over there, by which time, of course, the hole is moving away, it's moved away, it's gone. </p> <p>Manchee's torn twixt racing after it and coming back to me but he finally comes back to me. </p> <p>\"Crying, Todd?\" </p> <p>\"Shut up,\" I say and aim a kick at him. It misses on purpose.</p> <p>\u2022 (c) Patrick Ness 2008. Extracted from The Knife of Never Letting Go by Patrick Ness. Reproduced by permission of Walker Books Ltd, London SE11 5HJ</p>",
  "<p>Zadie Smith puts her fabulous connections to use with a charity anthology of stories from some of the best young writers in the UK and US. The odd turkey aside (I'm keeping mum not out of respect for their lofty reputations, but because I don't wish to spoil the fun of finding them for yourself), this is a triumph. Smith's beautifully simple brief to the authors was to \"make somebody up\". The collection delights in the traditional: it is impossible to read Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn's \"Donal Webster\" and not fall in love with straightforward fiction all over again. There's also the non-traditional: Daniel Clowes's graphic story about internet movie critics versus \"the print guys\" had me flailing round frantically for someone with whom to share its brilliance. Miranda July is, on this occasion, the right side of kooky, but the revelation for me was Edwidge Danticat's effortlessly cool prose, keeping in check all manner of pain and feeling. Also, what fun have a literary anthology that looks so unapologetically cool. Young people will be buying copies next.</p>",
  "<p>In the 1980s, long before recent bestsellers about wizards and Cathars, Eco noted the plethora of \"neo-medieval pulp\" in bookshops. Twenty years later, he sees a broader backward trend: the west's clash with Islamist jihad replays the Crusades, and war in Afghanistan circles back to Britain and Russia's 19th-century Great Game. In Berlusconi's Italy, where power is exercised through near-monopoly control of the mass media, the novelist and professor of semiotics sees parallels with the fascist rule of his own boyhood. The war on terror and Berlusconi dominate Turning Back the Clock, a collection of columns and lectures in which Eco moves away from the cultural preoccupations of earlier compilations. In analysing current affairs he's invariably sane, astute and capable of making suggestive historical connections; but something has been lost in his transformation from a don rampaging around in popular culture to a sensible political pundit. When you read Eco, you want to be dazzled and provoked, not merely to nod in agreement.</p>",
  "<p>In late July, Jay Babcock, editor of Los Angeles-based counterculture magazine Arthur, announced he'd finally had his fill of the city of angels. \"LA is a psychic death hole to me,\" he told the Los Angeles Times from his new home in Brooklyn. \"There are so many impending crises \u2014 the political structure, the traffic, the educational system\u2026 culture in LA is in a race to the bottom, and all the smart and creative people there are involved in new ways to do social networking or figure out what YouTube video is going to get the most views. That isn't culture, it's pure pandering.\" Babcock's comments caused the predictable comment-box controversy, and he'd later claim hiscomments were taken out of context, but in many ways, his slam seemed to confirm what people outside of Los Angeles thought of LA: a cultural desert, patrolled by Arnie's stormtroopers, peopled by bloodless Hollywood agents, cocktail waitresses and permed rockers who fell into creative limbo the day Axl Rose declared he was recording an album called Chinese Democracy, and never snapped out of it.</p> <p>Dean Spunt, though, isn't having any of it. \"Los Angeles is amazing right now,\" he says. \"There's no hair metal \u2014 just people trying to be actors and awesome Mexican kids from East LA and Compton going to shows with white kids from the suburbs. Right now, there's a unity in the LA scene where people can exist together no matter where they come from.\" Spunt is the singer/drummer for No Age, a dreamy Los Angeles punk duo who signed to Sub Pop last year after a bidding war, and his band represents a side of LA you won't have seen in The Hills, Entourage, or those creepy adverts where Governor Arnie and friends try to persuade you to visit California with all the tight-faced charms of a T-1000 holding a gun to your temple. </p> <p>No Age were born out of The Smell, a small all-ages punk venue in the Gallery District, just off the old homeless district of Skid Row. \"It's where a lot of friends play and work, kids from different suburbs trying out new ideas,\" says Spunt's No Age bandmate, guitarist Randy Randall. \"There's quite a communal vibe \u2014 you know, it's run by volunteers who'll come down to stamp hands, or run the vegan snack bar, or go 'Hey, I made pizza tonight!' and sell it. Jim [Smith, Smell founder] will call me and go, 'hey someone fell through, can you come do sound tonight?' And if I've got time I'll go down.\" That's where similarities to your local community centre ends, though: The Smell's most recent crop of post-No Age bands \u2014 the likes of HEALTH, Mika Miko, Abe Vigoda, and the Mae Shi \u2014 have seen it talked up as one of the most fertile hotbeds in US rock since Brooklyn turned into a factory line for trust fund bands trying to follow the Strokes to superstardom. The kids that cluster at The Smell are arguably descendants of the LA punk bands that ruled the city in the 1980s, with their skateboards, wallet chains and hand-scrawled flyers, but the music they make isn't so easily pigeonholed. \"You can be here any different night and see 10 different styles of music,\" says Randall. Scuzzy guitars and pounding drums meet tropical rhythms, ear-blistering noise and zonked DIY psychedelia. \"The bands all sound different, adds Spunt. But the spirit is the same.\"</p> <p>LA's sprawling geography means The Smell \u2014 and similar small venues and gallery spaces like Pherspace and Tiny Creatures \u2014 aren't just a place to drop in, but a beacon of inspiration for like-minded kids from the distant suburbs. \"We're always categorised as an LA band or a Smell band but at the same time we used to drive 40 minutes to go to the Smell, to hang out with our friends,\" says Juan Velazquez, singer/guitarist of tropical-tinged punks Abe Vigoda, who was born in Mexico, but grew up in Chino, east of LA in the Inland Empire. \"Los Angeles doesn't have that DIY punk reputation in the way that New York has, or Baltimore has \u2014 no one ever thinks of it as an art place, like, something weird can come from there. So it's kinda cool that people are beginning to recognise that stuff that's always been bubbling under.\"</p> <p>Just as Los Angeles rock music seemed to get stuck in the poodlepermed 1980s and never quite let go, so too does the spirit of gangsta rap hang over the city, long after its hip-hop crown was snatched back, first by New York, then the syrupsipping rappers of the Dirty South. Steve Ellington, aka Los Angeles hip-hop producer Flying Lotus, certainly remembers it fondly. \"Doggystyle, man,\" he coos.</p> <p>\"Snoop Doggy Dogg in '93. That album was the soundtrack to my life when I was a kid. Those beats sound like the city. When it came to finding an MC to rap over his early beats, it wouldn't quite work. \"They'd be like, saying shit and I'll be, 'I wasn't thinking that when I made the beat'. My tracks are like my little children and if someone comes out all 'I'm gonna kill this motherfucker, shoot this bitch!' I'm like, peace man, hippy vibes\u2026\" His second album, Los Angeles, is hip-hop with heatstroke, all beats that drop slightly out of kilter and synths that shimmer as if viewed across a hot car park \u2014 but it's just the tip of a new generation of woozy instrumental hip-hop from producers like Samiyam, Ras G, and The Gaslamp Killer that take an eclectic approach to influence, cutting up wobbly synths, slamming beats, and hemp-puffing 1970s psychedelia with reckless abandon. \"It's like jazz cats back in the day,\" explains Ellington. \"They were all inspired by each other. It's like a community thing, not competition, just inspiration\u2026 it's competing with self.\"</p> <p>The great nephew of Alice Coltrane, Ellington has certainly picked up something of that cosmic vibe. \"You calling me a hippy?' he grins. \"Sure, a lot of my friends are hippies \u2014 on that beatnik vibe. You know, there's so much going on right now, we're in this weird transitional thing with the economy and the war. It's that sort of time where people feel like they wanna get on a soapbox and shout from the rooftops.\"</p> <p>Flying Lotus' music, and the music arising from The Smell isn't political per se, but they share a hazy sort of positivity: the feeling that the world might be all screwed up, but if you keep your friends close, everything will be OK. \"One of the reason I like LA is that this scene can exist, and my friends, everyone's got the same mentality, but then you can be sitting next to somebody who's pushing their screenplay, or they're yelling at their assistant,\" laughs Juan from Abe Vigoda. \"But it's kind of cool those things can exist together. And it's cool that people are now focusing on LA for good reasons. You know, instead of hair metal. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> No Age's Nouns, Abe Vigoda's Skeleton and Flying Lotus' Los Angeles are out now</p> <h2>The LA takers</h2> <p><strong>No Age</strong><br><strong>Who</strong>: Randy Randall and Dean Spunt, founding fathers of the new LA punk scene, blending the scuzz and tempo of 1980s hardcore with the warm shoegaze throb of My Bloody Valentine.</p> <p><strong>Flying Lotus</strong><br><strong>Who</strong>: Woozy, jazz-tinged instrumental hip-hop producer from Winnetka in the Los Angeles suburbs.

  "<p>Baltimore - it's been an ordinary week in Maryland's largest city. The August heat broke and one can nearly sleep with a window open; the Orioles are again down in the cellar in the American League East; the city murder rate is a bit behind last year's blood-letting, and if it holds into the fall, politicians and police commanders will compete to claim credit.</p> <p>The stories in the Baltimore Sun remain fixed on the surface, each of them premised on the givens: schools will open next week and provide more or less the same inferior education as previous years; Johns Hopkins is building its biotech park expansion where the East Baltimore ghetto used to be and the ghetto is migrating due east and north-east; the biotech park will be great for white folk with college degrees, for those with union cards, the factories are still closed and the port is still losing cargo to Norfolk; a shooting here, a cutting there ...</p> <p>All in all, an unremarkable summer.</p> <p>Save for one lonely headline the other day - something that genuinely intrigues. It's a curious item - a draft report by a local non-profit foundation, a simple statistical study of the difference between Baltimore criminal juries and those of the surrounding, suburban counties.</p> <p>It seems that in Baltimore, one of the most violent cities in America, jurors are far more reluctant to convict criminal defendants than in the suburban enclaves that ring the city.</p> <p>The report upset the city's chief prosecutor; she thought its conclusions \"politically divisive\" and asked the foundation to either amend the draft study or kill it entirely. The press mocked her for this, of course, and rightly so, while on the radio here, white talk-show hosts had fun speculating about why city jurors - read \"black people\" - won't do their civic duty when it is, in fact, their communities that are so overwhelmed by crime.</p> <p>Everyone had something to say for a day or two, and of course, after that brief span of time, the entire issue disappeared into the glowing mediafest that was Michael Phelps and his remarkable collection of gold medals. Phelps is from Baltimore, by the way. As he is not wrapped in crime-scene tape, hampered by a budget shortfall or unable to raise his standardised test scores to the national average, we claim the great Olympian with considerable pride. The boy can swim, yes he can.</p> <p>In any event, the story about the reluctant city juries slipped quickly below the waves in the Beijing pool without anyone ever seriously inquiring into the why of it, much less attempting to do any actual reporting on the matter.</p> <p>Anomaly noted. Half-assed speculation offered. On to new business.</p> <p>But here's the thing of which we can all be certain, the thing that fuels all the dramatic arcs of The Wire, in fact: the why is the only thing that actually matters. The who, the what, the when, the where, even the how - every other building block in which journalists and policy planners and political leaders routinely trade - amount to nothing beyond the filler, interchangeable with the facts flung a year ago, a year from now and decades hence.</p> <p>The why is it. The why is what makes journalism an adult game. The why is what makes policy coherent and useful. The why is what transforms bureaucrats and foot soldiers and political leaders into viable instruments of rational and affirmative change. The why is everything and without it, the very suggestion of human progress becomes a cosmic joke.</p> <p>And in the American city, at the millennium, the why has ceased to exist.</p> <p>When I read reviews and commentary on The Wire in the British press, I am usually moved to a peculiar and conflicted place. I'm gratified by the incredible amount of verbiage accorded our little drama and I'm delighted to have the fundamental ideas and arguments of the piece discussed seriously.</p> <p>But at the same time, I'm acutely aware that our dystopian depiction of Baltimore has more appeal the farther one travels from America. The Wire is, of course, dissent of a kind and it is true that there are many of my countrymen who are in fundamental disagreement with the manner in which the nation is being governed and managed. But somehow, it sounds better to my ear when it's my own people talking trash and calling our problems out.</p> <p>At the same time, it's not just a question of standing, but of nuance as well. I get that we've been the bull in the china shop internationally, that we've been arrogant and tone-deaf in so many arenas for so many years, and now, with the margins of the American empire being pressed, everyone is ready to embrace the requisite number of I-told-you-so moments. Fair enough. We had it coming. But the emotion in all of that sometimes leads the overseas commentary about Baltimore and The Wire toward something that I don't recognise as accurate.</p> <p>Baltimore is not the inner circle of hell. It is not entirely devoured by a drug economy that serves as its last viable industry. It is not a place in which gangsters routinely fire clip after clip, spraying the streets in daylight ambushes. It is not unlivable, or devoid of humanity, or a reservoir of unmitigated human despair.</p> <p>I live in Baltimore, in a neighbourhood that is none of these things. I am vested in the city and its future and I can drive you to places in this city that would transform even the most devout Wire fan into a fat, happy tourist. Baltimore's charms are no less plentiful than most American cities.</p> <p>And yet there are places in Baltimore where The Wire is not at all hyperbole, where all of the depicted tragedy and waste and dysfunction are fixed, certain and constant. And that place is, I might add, about 20 blocks from where I live.</p> <p>That is the context of The Wire and that is the only context in which Baltimore - and by reasonable extension, urban America - can be fairly regarded. There are two Americas - separate, unequal, and no longer even acknowledging each other except on the barest cultural terms. In the one nation, new millionaires are minted every day. In the other, human beings no longer necessary to our economy, to our society, are being devalued and destroyed. Both things are true, and one gets a sense, reading the distant reaction to The Wire, that Europeans are far more ready to be convinced by one vision than the other.</p> <p>I used to quote Churchill as declaring that a first-rate mind was one that could maintain two opposing ideas at the same time. It certainly sounded Churchillian to me until someone better read pointed out that this notable quote is by F Scott Fitzgerald.</p> <p>At first this disappoints, because the quote, to me, seems to argue for political nuance, for subtlety and precision in state affairs. For a long while, the literary origin of the credo made no sense.</p> <p>But then, The Wire.</p> <p>As with Fitzgerald, we were selling story only. And at all points, when filming our drama, we understood that we were arguing the case of one America to the other. We were not saying everything, showing everything. We focused on the urban dynamic of drugs, crime and race. We argued the fraud of the drug war and offered an elegy for the death of union labour and the working class. We ruminated on the political infrastructure and its inability to reform. We picked a fight over the decline of public education and the lie behind our national claim to equality of opportunity. And lastly, we suggested that in the end, no one in our media culture is paying attention or asking hard questions.</p> <p>We did not contemplate immigration. We largely ignored sex-based discrimination, feminism and gender issues. We spoke not a word about the pyramid scheme that is the mortgage crisis, or the diminishing consumer class, or the time bomb that all of our China-bought debt might prove to be. Nor did we glory in the healthy sectors of the American economy, in the growth industries of the information age. We did not embrace Brooklyn Heights and West Los Angeles, Silicon Valley and Marin County. Hell, we didn't even rest for more than a day or two in Roland Park or Mount Washington or Towson - those Baltimore neighbourhoods that define a viable, monied America. We spoke to the other part of town, the forgotten place, the one they don't tell many stories about, at least not in the medium of entertainment television. It was a story rooted in truth, but it wasn't the only story or the only truth. Who, but a second-rate mind, would claim otherwise?</p> <p>Yet in my country, they actually argue the point. While British audiences might believe The Wire to represent more than it does, Americans - many of them, at least - are quick to argue that it doesn't represent everything and is therefore, somehow, not representative of anything at all.</p> <p>Was the Wire myopic? Should it have been allowed to dwell for five seasons on that in America which is broken and brutal? Was it not obliged, as an act of journalistic equanimity, if not dramatic power, to display portions of the America where human lives are not marginalised and discarded?</p> <p>Well, there are about 350 television shows about the affluent America, the comfortable America, the viable and cohesive nation where everyone gets what they want if they either work hard or know someone or have a pretty face or cheat like hell. That America is available every night, on every channel in the Comcast package.</p> <p>For a brief time, there was one television drama about the other America.</p> <p>Are we really going to debate whether it was one too many?</p> <p>Which brings us back to this week in Baltimore and that jury report, the one that everyone had something to say about, but no one actually bothered to analyse. The draft study, which tracked jury trials in Baltimore over a one-year period from July 2005, found that jurors in surrounding, predominantly white suburban counties were 30 times more likely to convict defendants of the most serious charge. Overall in the surrounding counties, the acquittal rate was 27%. In the city, it was 43%. And the disinclination of Baltimore juries to convict drug defendants on serious charges was even more pronounced, according to the Baltimore Sun.</p> <p>The Sun's coverage indicated that the report's author had speculated vaguely as to \"population characteristics and socioeconomic factors\" being relevant to the statistical variance. The Sun itself provided no additional analysis, reportage, thought or speculation as to why city juries behave as they do.</p> <p>Again, the why of the thing. The only part that really matters.</p> <p>Because in my city, we have fought the drug war to the very end of the line, with sergeants becoming lieutenants and majors becoming colonels and city mayors becoming state governors. We have done so for decades, one day into the next, one administration after another, each claiming progress and measuring such in arrest rates, drug seizures, crime stats. And no one asks: why?</p> <p>No one asks why, with all the arrests and seizures, the availability and purity of narcotics and cocaine has actually increased over the past three decades. No one asks why, with all the law enforcement committed, whole tracts of the city have nonetheless degenerated into free-fire war zones. No one asks why police commanders are routinely able to reduce the rates of robbery, or rape, or assault significantly in any time period prior to an election, while the murder rate - in which the victim can't be obscured or clerically \"unfounded\" - stays as high as ever. And now, this week, no one asks why men and women from Baltimore, upon being given a chance to strike a blow against disorder and mayhem by convicting those charged criminally, would shirk their responsibility.</p> <p>Well, here it is, plain as day...</p> <p>In order to elect Baltimore's mayor as Maryland's governor, crime had to go down. And when that mayor was unable to do so legitimately, through a meaningful deterrent, his police officials did not merely go about cooking their statistics, making robberies and assaults disappear by corrupting the reporting of such incidents, they resorted to something far more disturbing.</p> <p>For the last years of his administration, Mayor Martin O'Malley ordered the mass arrests of citizens in every struggling Baltimore neighbourhood, from eastside to west. More than 100,000 bodies were dragged to Central Booking in a single year - record rates of arrest for a city with fewer than 700,000 residents. Corner boys, touts, drug slingers, petty criminals - yes, they went in the wagons.</p> <p>But school teachers, city workers, shopkeepers, delivery boys - they too were jacked up, cuffed and hauled down to Eager Street - hundreds of them a night on the weekends. Some were charged, but few were prosecuted. And in 25,000 such cases, they were later freed from the detention facility without ever going to court; no charges were proffered because, well, no crime had been committed.</p> <p>I wasn't arrested. Nor was Ed Burns or Dominic West or Aidan Gillen. Nor were my neighbours or the Baltimore Sun's editors or the members of the Maryland Club. But then, we're all white. Among the black members of my cast and crew, it was often impossible to drive from the film set to home at night without being stopped - and in some cases detained or arrested - on nonexistent probable cause and nonexistent charges. The crackdown came wholly in black neighbourhoods and it landed wholly on the backs of black citizens.</p> <p>And now, just a few years later, comes this document that causes the state's attorney to deny the obvious and leaves everyone else wondering weakly and vaguely as to the why of it. Is it so hard to understand that the same people who had their civil rights cleanly dispatched, who spent nights in jail because police officers lied on them and dragged them off without charge - that these people might be inclined to disbelieve the word of law enforcement in any future criminal case?</p> <p>In places like West Baltimore, the drug war destroyed every last thing that the drugs themselves left standing - including the credibility of the police deterrent. To elect one man to higher office, an entire city alienated its citizenry and destroyed its juror pool.</p> <p>Mayor O'Malley is now Governor O'Malley. The police commanders have all been promoted. A daily newspaper that had no stomach for addressing the why a decade ago when it had 400 editors and reporters, a newspaper more consumed with prize submissions and gotcha stories than with complex analysis of its city's problems, now has 220 bodies in its newsroom and is even less capable of the task. And nothing, of course, changes.</p> <p>Yes, such a scenario is grist for The Wire. We could have easily built half a season out of the collapse of the Baltimore jury pool and the inability of city prosecutors to bring cases into court.</p> <p>Yet there is also something appalling in the suggestion that a television drama - a presumed entertainment - might be a focal point for a discussion of what has gone wrong in urban America, for why we have become a society that no longer even recognises the depth of our problems, much less works to solve any of them.</p> <p>But where else is the why even being argued any more? Not in the stunted political discourse of an American election cycle, not in an eviscerated, self-absorbed press, not in any construct to which the empowered America, the comfortable and comforted America, gives its limited attention. To know why city juries won't participate in the drug war any more, to know why they have opted out of our collective dysfunction, you'd have to travel to the other America - to West Fayette Street or Park Heights Avenue or East Madison Street or any other of the forgotten places. And, well, as has already been said, we are separate nations at this point. Few of us ever cross the frontier to hear voices different from our own. \u00b7</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A newspaperman for 13 years, David Simon is the author of Homicide: A Year On The Killing Streets, published in the UK by Canongate, as well as an executive producer and writer of HBO's The Wire.</p>",

A final stray round busted off the top of a bottle of whiskey and I drank the lot. Some nigger.</p> <p>I went down to the quay where the man, Johnson, who had chartered the boat, was waiting. We baited up and were soon hooked into a marlin. Must have been a thousand pounds. Johnson struck too soon and lost it. Lost the rod with it. I could have pulled it in one-handed while I nailed some rum, but you get used to schmucks in this business.</p> <p>He never gave me the 880 dollars he owed me.

I give you 1,200 dollars,\" Mr Sing said.</p> <p>\"It's a deal,\" I replied. I could smell the double-cross. Some Chink.</p> <p>Mr Sing skulled the last of them out to the boat and I pulled him on board. I took the money, cracked his arms, cracked his neck. It was either kill him or let him kill the other 12. I took the boat back to shore and offloaded the Chinks.

  "<p>Hardline unions are set to split the TUC next week with a motion calling for the first general strike since 1926 in protest against Labour's refusal to give back secondary picketing rights and allow prison officers to strike.</p> <p>The Prison Officers Association has angered the TUC council by calling for a series of one-day general strikes in protest at ministers blocking a leftwing Labour backbencher's bill this year which would have restored many of the union rights taken away by the Conservatives in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>It will be backed by the RMT rail union, led by Bob Crow, which has organised a series of strikes on the London Underground and in national rail companies over wages and conditions this year. Other unions such as the Fire Brigades Union and the Public and Commercial Services Union may support it.</p> <p>Restoring secondary picketing powers for the unions has been an important cause for the left. The issue was raised by Derek Simpson, joint general secretary of the country's biggest union, Unite, during talks on future Labour manifesto commitments at the Warwick policy forum in July. But Gordon Brown has refused to respond to the union demands, telling journalists that \"there will be no return to the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s\" over concessions to trade union laws.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington who was author of the failed bill, said: \"We intend to reintroduce the bill and table amendments to the government's existing employment bill to give trade unions more rights.</p> <p>\"The TUC bureaucracy have always been lukewarm in support of this, but we think that it is even more relevant that trade unions have more power to organise, given the dire consequences of the recession that will lead to more layoffs and privatisation.\"</p> <p>The POA motion accuses ministers of \"political sabotage ... to ensure the bill fell\" and of taking \"even more draconian legislative action to stifle unions\". The motion caused conflict at Thursday's TUC council when members instructed Brendan Barber, the general secretary, to ask the POA to withdraw it to prevent an embarrassing distraction for the media. But the union has no intention of doing so.</p> <p>If the motion goes ahead at Brighton next week it will expose a divide between unions over the tactics needed to win trade union law reform. It will also fuel Tory charges that the government is under constant pressure to give way to demands from Labour's paymasters. </p> <p>Barber said yesterday: \"Given all the other more serious issues that need debating, from low pay to working conditions, this motion is self-indulgent. I have been asked to request the POA to withdraw it.\"</p> <p>The POA general secretary, Brian Caton, said: \" We believe that the need for new rights for trade unions is supported by tens of thousands of workers and that we have got nowhere so far in negotiations. Jack Straw's decision to introduce tougher legislation banning prison officers from going on strike has angered our members and we have no intention of backing down over this.\"</p> <p>The row comes during a difficult week for Labour with the chancellor, Alistair Darling, and Brown both due to address the congress.</p> <p>Barber said yesterday: \"Many union members are very angry about public sector pay being limited to 2% while inflation is nearly 5% and it would be in the government's own interest to change policy.\"</p> <p>He praised the London mayor, Boris Johnson, for backing a London living wage of \u00a37.45 for the poorest workers in the capital, nearly \u00a32 above the national minimum wage of \u00a35.52. \"He deserves the credit for introducing it, although the Tories don't deserve any credit for never backing a minimum wage in the first place.\" </p> <p>Barber also said he thought David Cameron was taking a positive step in arranging meetings with the TUC to hear their views. His strongest criticism was reserved for John Hutton, the business secretary, who \"made him cringe\" when he backed the case for more millionaires and whose department was \"a one-sided ministry that just championed business\".</p>",
  "<p>An eight-year-old Iranian boy locked up at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre since July 15 has been released after solicitors began High Court proceedings against the Home Office, challenging the legality of his detention.</p> <p>On Monday the Guardian reported the story of the child, who for legal reasons is known only as Child M. His family are trying to claim asylum in the UK, arguing their lives are in danger if they return to Iran after a photocopy of The Satanic Verses was found in their house.</p> <p>Although Child M was released on Thursday, his lawyers are still seeking a judicial review, arguing that his detention was unlawful under English common law and under the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>If he wins his legal team will ask for damages.

  "<p>I am a secondary school English teacher and I was interested to read about the decision by the AQA to withdraw Carol Ann Duffy's poem Education for Leisure from the GCSE syllabus and to ask schools to destroy the anthology that includes the poem (Top exam board asks schools to destroy book containing knife poem, September 4).</p> <p>I think that the exam board have not gone nearly far enough and should further scrutinise this publication before issuing a new edition of it. There is another Carol Ann Duffy poem in this book which strongly suggests that a woman has killed a man after a one-night stand and has woken up in a bed soaked with his blood. There are two Robert Browning poems in the anthology, one of which depicts a woman having a deadly poison made with which to kill a love rival, and another which seems to be about a man who has killed his wife because she was disobedient. </p> <p>There is a Thomas Hardy poem called The Man He Killed, though this might be deemed suitable because the killing happens in battle and the narrator suggests that in other circumstances he might have bought his unfortunate victim a drink. There are poems about infant mortality, which might be very upsetting to some, elderly relatives being taken to hospital to die, the last testament of a man about to be beheaded, family conflict and domestic violence, a man who violently assaults a hitchhiker he picks up, the roasting of human beings in a Nazi death camp and one about secret state agents violently beating prisoners. I could go on.</p> <p>I am worried that, should I continue to teach these poems, my students might be encouraged to become spouse killers, inflictors of casual violence, generally dysfunctional and sexually promiscuous to boot. They are also in danger of finding out that they and their families are mortal and that the world can be a very cruel place, which might have all sorts of consequences for their psychological wellbeing. </p> <p>I will check through Shakespeare for similarly dangerous themes.

  "<p>Can you rely on \"five-star\" travel insurance sold as part of a premium bank account to rescue you when things go wrong? My policy is with NatWest, my holiday was with Zoom in Canada, and I found out the hard way that such insurance isn't nearly as comprehensive as it sounds. </p> <p>At the end of August our family were left stranded in Vancouver after Zoom Airlines collapsed. In a panic about getting back for work, and the children back to school, we, like many other stranded travellers, scrambled around to get flights home.</p> <p>The best we could do was to take a BA flight out of Seattle - about a four-hour bus ride from Vancouver. And it was at a cost of about \u00a33,000 for the four of us.</p> <p>I immediately rang our \"newly-improved, five-star\" travel insurance that we are supposedly protected by through our NatWest Advantage Private bank account, only to be informed that, after checking the policy small print, we and other NatWest customers were not covered. </p> <p>The policy did not include the failure of a scheduled airline. </p> <p>Ah, that dreaded small print. Interestingly, being a financial journalist aware that rising fuel prices were clobbering airlines, I had tried to check the small print of the policy before leaving. </p> <p>In the latest big booklet I had from NatWest explaining the huge advantages of my account - which costs \u00a3240 per year - there is a mention of worldwide travel insurance, but no terms and conditions. It refers you to the bank's website or a phone number.</p> <p>I checked the website but it only offered a phone number. I rang it and held for about 15 minutes before hanging up in frustration and assuming five-star meant what it said. If, of course, I had been easily able to find out that airline failure was not covered, I could have made a decision to shop around for a different airline or an alternative policy to cover me. But instead I'm now \u00a33,000 out of pocket and wondering why I've spent hundreds of pounds a year on a premium bank account. </p> <p>NatWest said: \"In common with the overwhelming majority of travel insurance policies, NatWest's Advantage Private travel insurance does not cover any financial loss incurred by a customer as a result of the collapse of an airline. This is clearly set out in the terms and conditions.\"</p> <p>Some travellers have claimed on credit cards but we paid by debit card. </p> <p>My next step is the Financial Ombudsman, which dislikes banks that treat customers unfairly. I am determined to get this money back and will keep Money readers posted.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ashley Seager is the Guardian's economics correspondent</p> <h2>Failing to cover all the options</h2> <p>The reason that Ashley Seager's NatWest travel insurance policy failed to pay up was because it did not include the little-known but important Scheduled Airline Failure (SAF) cover.</p> <p>SAF, as the name suggests, is there to pick up the pieces in the event your airline goes out of business, either prior to departure or while you are abroad. </p> <p>In the current economic climate, with scores of airlines failing, it has become a vital element of cover when travelling. However, in recent years most travel insurers have quietly removed SAF from policies - if they ever had it at all.</p> <p>Had Seager's annual policy included SAF, the insurer would have picked up the bill to fly his family home after they were left stranded in Canada. Most set a limit of \u00a31,500-\u00a33,000 per insured person to pay for alternative flights. </p> <p>Guardian Money searched the market and could only find Swiftcover and the Post Office still offering SAF. </p> <p>The former allows those buying its policies to add on SAF for a small extra premium. The Post Office includes it automatically in its policies (worldwide cover for a family of four, including the US, costs \u00a3126). </p> <p>The policies of budget airlines easyJet and Ryanair also include it, as do some policies bought direct from travel agents.</p> <p>Jeffrey Klipp, of specialist insurer Marcus Hearn, which supplies SAF to travel agents, says that it is impossible to buy a stand-alone SAF cover if your travel policy fails to include it.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the Zoom episode is a reminder to those who book their flights separately on the internet to always use a credit, rather than debit, card to pay for flights. <br><strong>Miles Brignall</strong></p>",
  "<p>Is it over? Was that the oil shock? Can we relax, sit back and expect our energy bills and prices at the pumps to tumble? It is true that the price of oil is down. In early July, the price peaked at $147 a barrel. Yesterday it hit $106. A fall of almost 30% in two months suggests the old rule that \"nothing cures high prices like high prices\" may finally be working in the oil market.</p> <p>Americans used less in their cars over the summer: demand in the US fell by 800,000 barrels a day in the first half of this year, the largest decline for 26 years. In the UK, Ryanair is grounding more planes this winter. The global economy is slowing - even China, the biggest source of new demand, may soon be feeling colder breezes. But what's this? Leading members of Opec, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, want to reduce oil supplies to keep the price high.</p> <p>The 13 members of the cartel meet in Vienna next week and Iran and Venezuela have made their position clear. \"Oil supply must be well proportioned with demand, and control over Opec's excess oil supply is an issue that must be discussed,\" said Gholam Hossein Nozari, Iran's oil minister, this week. Translation: he doesn't want to see the price fall below $100.</p> <p>To many in the west, the stance will seem outrageous. Gordon Brown was furious with Opec in May, when the price was $135 a barrel. \"It is, as people will recognise, a scandal that 40% of the oil is controlled by Opec, that their decisions can restrict the supply of oil to the rest of the world, and that at a time when oil is desperately needed and supply needs to expand that Opec can withhold supply from the market,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown sounded like a buttoned-up version of the property tycoon Donald Trump, whose regular rants against Opec have entertained viewers of US financial television channels in the past year. </p> <p>\"It is an illegal monopoly,\" he told CNBC a few months ago. \"If businesses ever formed Opec, everybody would be put in jail. Every time a country hits oil, they are invited into the cartel. It's a disgrace.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, the west's view of Opec was different. The organisation, having enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s, was regarded as a spent force. Its summits in hotels in Vienna and Geneva were dismissed as squabbles over who had been cheating on quotas by over-producing - usually Venezuela or Nigeria. After 25 years of trying to control the oil market, Opec seemed doomed - damned by internal indiscipline and the success of the west in finding alternative supplies of oil.</p> <p>Its nadir was 1998, when Opec was persuaded to increase production quotas. The timing was awful. The Asian currency crisis slowed the region's Tiger economies and the price of oil fell to close to $10 a barrel. The following year, the Economist magazine famously predicted the price could be heading to $5. The world was \"drowning in oil\". Opec seemed irrelevant and powerless.</p> <p><strong>Boomtime</strong></p> <p>Then the boom started. The 1990s were revealed as a decade of under-investment, not only by Opec but by non-Opec producers, including the big oil companies. New fields hadn't been discovered. Refining capacity hadn't been built. Shell had over-stated its reserves. Existing oil fields were depleting faster than expected, especially in Mexico and the North Sea. China and India began to industrialise and to subsidise oil for their own citizens. Demand was accelerating and supply was struggling to keep up.</p> <p>The ability of the US to bully Saudi Arabia, Opec's most important member, into increasing production quickly came under question. The Saudis guard closely their data on the oil reserves and production capability. Why? \"Peak oil\" theorists argue it's because the big reserves aren't as big as advertised. </p> <p>Even President George Bush seemed to endorse the thought in January this year. \"If they don't have a lot of additional oil to put on the market, it is hard to ask somebody to do something they may not be able to do,\" he said.</p> <p>In the autumn of 2006, with the price having fallen from $75 to $60 a barrel, Opec demonstrated it was willing to use its newly restored influence over prices. It briefly reduced its production quotas, a signal that it was prepared to defend a price of $60 a barrel. With barely a blip along the way, the price climbed to that record of $147 this July.</p> <p>Was that Opec alone? Was it the combination of growth in China and India and the western oil companies' inability to increase production? Was it the weakness of the dollar, creating an incentive for producers to leave their appreciating asset in the ground rather than turn it into a depreciating currency? Was it a classic investment bubble, fuelled by the growth of financial speculation in the futures market? Probably some or all of the above. Either way, the approach of $100 is a critical test of Opec's current mood and power.</p> <p>In the old days, the Saudis were the voice of restraint. After the oil shock of the 1970s, the Saudi oil minister Ahmed Yamani urged fellow members to be cautious, arguing that high prices would lead to a reduction in demand and cause the west to become more fuel-efficient. Yet the Saudi ruling families have a huge social welfare programme to fund - as a rough guess, say some analysts, a price of $70, if sustained for a long period, would now create political tension. </p> <p>Add $20 or so for the economies of Iran and Venezuela, also built on the single commodity of oil.</p> <p>\"Could the price go below $100, to $90 or even $80?,\" asks Mike Wagstaff, chief executive of Venture Production, a North Sea oil and gas producer. \"Well, yes, it could but I can't see it going much lower than that. Opec has shown itself to be a much more disciplined organisation over the past seven or eight years.\"</p> <p>He also argues that \"the reality is that the west can't afford the price to go much below $100 because people need to fund investment.\" His point is that the industry's costs have risen as oil has become harder to find and to produce. A deep-water rig used for drilling in the deep waters off Brazil or west Africa costs $600,000 to $700,000 a day to hire; three or four years ago, the price was $200,000 to $350,000. Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs calculate that the marginal cost of production, a critical figure for all commodities, now lies between $80 and $90 a barrel.</p> <p>Hugo Navarro of Capital Economics expects to see a classic fudge from Opec next week. He thinks official quotas will be left unchanged but actual production will be quietly cut in the coming months.</p> <p>He argues that Saudi Arabia is sensitive to western public opinion and doesn't want to be seen to be putting pressure on prices at a time when global growth is slowing. \"Even at current price levels, the cartel will still reap massive profit, given that Opec members have amongst the lowest production costs in the world,\" says Navarro.</p> <p>At the same, he says, the cartel has good reason to try to reduce output: \"The last time Opec significantly increased production to stave off a global economic slowdown in the late 1990s, the results were a disaster for the cartel.\" Even so, he thinks, attempts to support a price floor of $100 will be unsuccessful - Capital Economics sees prices fall to $90 in a year.</p> <p><strong>Bullish</strong></p> <p>Most other forecasters are more bullish, but even Goldman Sachs, which coined the phrase \"super spike\" more than three years ago, said yesterday oil was \"nearing a critical inflection point\". It still expects $130 a barrel for the fourth quarter of this year, and $140 in 2009, but attaches a big qualification: \"In the event that a global recession and hard landing in China does materialise, spot crude oil prices would likely fall well below $100 per barrel.\"</p> <p>For consumers in the west, it's hard to find a reason to be cheerful in that forecast - expect either high energy prices or global recession. The shock isn't over.</p>",
  "<h2>When the loss adjustors lose the plot</h2> <p>Last November, some lead flashing was stolen from my brother's house, which he rents out. As he works in Africa, I claimed on his behalf on his Commercial Express landlord policy.</p> <p>A few weeks later, the thief came back but was disturbed, leaving the lead he had taken on the ground.</p> <p>I claimed again but, in agreement with the loss adjustor, I decided to replace all the flashing with zinc, which has negligible scrap value.</p> <p>I paid a third of the \u00a31,470 zinc cost as a third of the lead remained with the insurer picking up the \u00a3980 balance. But when the refund cheque was paid, it was for \u00a3780 - the insurer had deducted two excesses of \u00a3100, instead of the one I expected.</p> <p>Is this fair?<br><strong>JS, </strong>London</p> <p>Capital Letters first contacted IAS loss adjustors, who dealt with your claim. It suggested talking to Commercial Express, which had put your policy together. But Commercial Express said its claims handler had just left to join IAS. It pointed to US-based underwriter Navigators Group, not to be confused with Navigators &amp; General, a Zurich Group yacht insurer.</p> <p>Navigators' UK compliance officer refused to discuss this case even if we produced reams of letters of authority and waivers of confidentiality rights. </p> <p>And this unusual line was followed by Elliot Orol, the general counsel (chief legal officer) for Navigators in New York who spent nearly 30 minutes stating his firm \"took client service seriously\" and was \"honourable and fair\".</p> <p>There is much case law on whether a claim is one or several incidents for excesses. But several of Britain's major insurers say they would take a pragmatic view with a goodwill gesture as it is not worth losing a customer over \u00a3100, even if the strict policy wording favours it. The Commercial Express policy expires next week. You have instructed your broker to find a new insurer.</p> <h2>Needled by Compass maintenance demand</h2> <p>We bought a week's membership with the Compass Club, Tenerife, in 2000 and another week in 2003 - it gave free accommodation at a number of sites. Our first annual maintenance bill was \u00a3207. Each year it increased - it's now \u00a3360 and due to rise to more than \u00a3500. We have decided to quit.</p> <p>We wrote to Compass but we got a reply from Nexus Leisure which said we would have to pay a \u00a350 per week cancellation fee. Can they do this?<br><strong>JP, </strong>Cheshire</p> <p>You paid \u00a35,995 for your first week and \u00a33,750 for the second. And while the apartments are of good quality, you accept the deal was disadvantageous. The maintenance fee is only some \u00a350 less than renting, while you are losing around \u00a3400 a year in after-tax interest on the near-\u00a310,000 you have laid out. </p> <p>You accept you have lost your capital but want to cut other losses.</p> <p>There is nothing in your contract about exit fees. But there is a section which says your membership lapses if you are two weeks late in paying annual maintenance fees. Ignore this demand. Don't pay and let it lapse.</p> <h2>RBS bounced its own \u00a315,000 cheque</h2> <p>I paid a \u00a315,000 cheque into my Royal Bank of Scotland account.</p> <p>A week later, I heard the cheque had bounced. I accept cheques can go wrong but this one was drawn on Royal Bank of Scotland Collective Investments Ltd - the part of the bank you deal with if you have a meeting with them to discuss your savings. What is going on here?<br><strong>TM,</strong> Middlesex</p> <p>You invested a \u00a315,000 lump sum and \u00a3150 a month in an RBS bond after a meeting at the bank. But you were never sent the key features documents - when you asked, the bank told you it could not send them as they formed a legal contract. This is nonsense, so you exercised your cooling off rights. </p> <p>The bank sent you two cheques - one for \u00a315,000 and a second for \u00a3150.</p> <p>The latter cleared but the first, despite being drawn on the bank itself, bounced. You received no satisfactory explanation or any apology or offer of redress. </p> <p>When Capital Letters intervened, RBS was a little more forthcoming.</p> <p>It said the cheque was bounced \"due to a regrettable clerical error\" - a statement that raises more questions about RBS procedures than it answers. The cheque has now cleared and the bank will send you \u00a350, which covers your interest and costs.</p> <h2>Bullion offer from US is no golden opportunity</h2> <p>I wrote to you this time last year about a call I received from Stonebridge Financial Services in Florida. You suggested it was not a good idea to invest in their offer of heating oil futures, so I politely declined when the salesman called back. Now I have been contacted by another organisation in Florida, called American Bullion Advisors. What do you know about this one?<br><strong>OS,</strong> Birmingham</p> <p>It appears that ABV, whose website <a href=\"http://www.americanbullionadv.com\">americanbullionadv.com</a> seems to escape Google searches, is selling gold bullion on the dubious grounds that \"we may never see the metal at this price again\". Its salesman cites rising energy and oil prices, inflation and economic instability. You say there were the usual questions as to how much liquid cash you could raise in a few days and the promise that whatever you invested would be leveraged to increase profits by 250%. </p> <p>Of course, leverage works the other way as well and you could easily lose on the risky bullion market. ABV does offer a \"gold report\" to prospective clients, which Capital Letters has seen. But this could have been written at any time. It makes no reference to specific conditions in the bullion market which would affect your decision. </p> <p>As to why you were called, Chris Spinnler at ABV tells this column it is a \"branch of Stonebridge\". </p> <h2>Hot under the collar over cooler breakdown</h2> <p>In May, I bought a wine cooler from internet site To Your Home. It took 18 bottles at two different temperatures.</p> <p>I went for this model as it fitted under a work surface in my flat.</p> <p>After a few weeks, it stopped working. I emailed the company, which arranged for my cooler to be collected and repaired. But they sent back a faulty fridge which was dirty - and not mine. Since then, silence despite regular emails - there is no phone number. I am left with a filthy non-working fridge cluttering my flat. Should I take this to the dump and give up?<br><strong>VM,</strong> London</p> <p>As you paid \u00a3160 for the cooler only four months ago, you should not abandon it. Indeed, you should be entitled to a replacement.</p> <p>It seems the problem arose because the model had to be \"freestanding\". But just how freestanding was never made clear to you, either in the online information or in the instructions. Putting it under a work surface was not a good idea as this cooler needs a large amount of unobstructed air around it. </p> <p>When Capital Letters called, To Your Home accepted that the instructions were not clear enough.</p> <p>It no longer stocks the twin temperature cooler so will replace it with a new model of the same value which will function under a work surface.</p> <p><strong>Contact</strong> We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

  "<p>Labels can be packed with words, often foreign, sometimes strangely abbreviated, but don't let that put you off - all this information is really there to help. Know your labels, and you'll be another step closer to knowing your wines.</p> <p>Certain things must appear on the label by law. The legal requirements differ around the world, but in the EU the main information that must be given is: the producer and (if different) bottler, the region and country of origin, the quality classification, the year of vintage (if there is one, but not on table wine), the size of the bottle, the alcohol content and if the wine contains sulphites (sulphur dioxide). Many governments now insist on a health warning, too (with no nod to the possible benefits).</p> <p>It can be a lot to fit on one label, and designers don't like all those words. That's why you'll often find two labels - one on the back, one on the front - and sometimes even three, the third being round the neck. </p> <p>While European producers are beginning to follow those of the new world in noting the grape or grapes used, it can often be a mystery. What you need to know to decode the French label above is that the red grape grown in this Burgundy appellation is pinot noir. </p> <h2>Classifications </h2> <p>The legal classification is one of the most important pieces of information on a wine label - it is certainly a useful (though not foolproof) guide to the quality of what's inside. Most European countries operate a four-tier system modelled on the French appellation system, which began as a protection against fraud. The different tiers impose varying controls on grape varieties, yields and production methods - which get stricter the higher up you go.</p> <p>The top tier in France is <strong>AOC</strong>, appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e; followed by <strong>VDQS</strong>, vin d\u00e9limit\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure (becoming less common, as many regions classified as VDQS are being upgraded to AOC), then <strong>vin de pays</strong> (essentially \"country wines\") and the lowest category, <strong>vin de table</strong> (typically drunk only locally, and very rarely exported).</p> <p>Italy and Spain have a level above France's AOC - <strong>DOCG</strong> (denominazione di origine controllata e garantita) and <strong>DOC</strong> (denominaci\u00f3n de origen calificada). Then, echoing the French system, Italy has <strong>DOC</strong> (denominazione di origine controllata), <strong>IGT</strong> (indicazione geografiche tipica) and <strong>vino da tavola</strong>; while Spain has <strong>DO</strong> (denominaci\u00f3n de origen), <strong>vino de la tierra</strong> and <strong>vino de mesa.</strong></p> <p>Germany has <strong>QmP</strong> (Qualit\u00e4tswein mit Pr\u00e4dikat - quality wine with distinction), <strong>QbA</strong> (Qualit\u00e4tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete - quality wine from a specified region), then <strong>Landwein</strong> and <strong>Tafelwein</strong>. The ripeness (related to sweetness) of the grapes used in QmP wines is also indicated: from Kabinett to Trockenbeerenauslese (the ripest and rarest). The UK has the less glamorous-sounding <strong>quality wine</strong>, <strong>regional wine</strong> and <strong>table wine</strong></p> <p>New world countries have introduced appellation systems loosely based on the French one, though less strict. In the US, AVA (American Viticultural Area) only really guarantees the origin of the grapes, and therefore indicates the likely style of a wine. WO (wine of origin) is the South African equivalent of the AOC.</p> <h2>A special case</h2> <p>Never to be outdone, Bordeaux and Burgundy in France add their own systems of classification. We'll try to keep it simple. Burgundy's best vineyards are designated <strong>grand cru</strong>, the second best are labelled <strong>premier cru</strong></p> <p>The Graves district of Bordeaux has one classification to denote its top wines,<strong> cru class\u00e9</strong> (literally, classed growth). St \u00c9milion goes a bit further, with (starting at the top) <strong>premier grand cru class\u00e9</strong>, <strong>grand cru class\u00e9 </strong>and <strong>grand cru </strong>(not the mark of prestige here that it is in Burgundy). But Bordeaux's M\u00e9doc goes all out, with five classed growths, from <strong>premier cru </strong>(first growth) down to <strong>cinqui\u00e8me cru</strong> (fifth growth). The award of such classifications can cause much controversy. </p> <h2>And there's more ... </h2> <p><strong>Superiore/sup\u00e9rieure</strong> denotes wines with a higher alcoholic strength than standard wines. </p> <p><strong>Reserva </strong>is used in Spain and Portugal for wine from a supposedly good vintage. A Spanish reserva (like an Italian <strong>riserva</strong>) will have been aged for longer before being released for sale. Not to be confused with Reserve on US wines, which is frequently added to imply prestige and can be meaningless. In Spain, <strong>crianza </strong>is used for the youngest aged wines, <strong>gran reserva</strong> for the oldest.</p>",
  "<p>Usain Bolt won the shoot-out of the world's fastest men here last night, but there was no time for showboating from the superstar of Beijing. Bolt was left at the start of the 100 metres by his fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell and only with 15m left did the Olympic champion and world record-holder exert any type of authority to snatch victory.</p> <p>But still he won in 9.77sec, another stupendous time. Not only was the race run into a headwind of -1.3 metres per second, the track was wet, with puddles across the inside two lanes after a torrential downpour and Bolt was the slowest of all nine athletes to rise from their blocks. But as the sport discovered at the Olympics, no barrier is too much for the 6ft 5in phenomenon from Trelawny.</p> <p>A year ago that winning time would have equalled the world record but now it is a mere blip in the rankings since Bolt ran 9.69 to triumph in Beijing - slowing down then with 20m left to start his celebration. That is the impact this 22-year-old has had on the sport this summer.</p> <p>Even his rivals know that running him so close is an achievement. \"Since I have been competing, this was one of my most exciting races,\" said Powell, the former world record-holder who was second in 9.83. The pair are great friends, and quite a double act. \"I was sleeping at the start,\" said Bolt which Powell quickly responded to by saying: \"With legs like those he does not need a good reaction [when the gun goes off].\"</p> <p>Bolt's presence, and their rivalry in particular, made the race a glorious occasion at this final Golden League meeting of the season, even in the absence of Tyson Gay, the injured American world champion. Three times the 50,000 crowd at the King Baudouin Stadium were asked for hush as the athletes were called to their blocks. </p> <p>Bolt has transformed the 100m. He now heads home to a hero's welcome, but he could arrive back with a warning for next summer. Powell runs in Rieti tomorrow afternoon, on the track where he broke the world record with 9.74 at the end of last season. Having clocked 9.72 in Lausanne on Tuesday, Powell said: \"He [Bolt] will be travelling home and I've told him to expect some bad news when he gets there.\" It was almost unnoticed that behind them were team-mates Nesta Carter, third in 10.07, and Michael Frater, fourth in 10.08. </p> <p>Watching Christine Ohuruogu, Britain's Olympic 400m champion, in a grand prix race is no longer the spectacle it was after she revealed in Beijing how she trains specifically for championships. Her formula works like those of few other athletes; last night she was never in contention over 200m, finishing seventh in 23.33 as Marshevet Hooker, of the US, won in 22.62.</p> <p>But one woman had a million reasons to be happy. Pamela Jelimo's victory in the 800m in 1:55.16, coupled with the Croatian Blanka Vlasic's failure to win the high jump, meant the 18-year-old from Kenya is the sole recipient of this year's Golden League prize for being the only athlete to remain unbeaten in their event in the six meetings of the series. Her reward: $1m (\u00a3567,095).</p>",
  "<p>No sport is entirely bullet-proof in the face of a global economic slowdown but rugby union is proving splendidly resilient. Just over 50,000 spectators are expected to slosh through the puddles to attend today's double-header at Twickenham, the latest illustration of the club game's soaring marketability. If the players can keep pace with the public appetite, the 2008-09 Guinness Premiership season will be as striking as any of its predecessors.</p> <p>It has reached the point, according to the Harlequins chief executive, Mark Evans, where barely any of the top Tri-Nations players will be able to resist boarding the gravy train. \"I think it'll be a rare southern hemisphere player over the next 10 years who doesn't play part of his career in the north,\" said Evans after unveiling plans for Quins to face Leicester in another 50,000-capacity Twickenham extravaganza on December 27. He did not need to add that the majority are either already here or frantically ringing their agents.</p> <p>Nor does Evans believe the bubble will burst in the foreseeable future. Even London Scottish, having clawed their way back to the equivalent of English rugby's third division, have just secured a half-million pound sponsorship deal with a Saudi investment firm. There have also been rumours of South African-backed investment in a middle-ranking National One club. Toulon are the new moneybags of France and Perpignan won the race to sign the All Black fly-half Dan Carter with a package reputedly worth about \u00a3600,000 for 20 games. </p> <p>\"A lot of the English clubs' financial models still don't work and some are still losing a lot of money,\" cautioned Evans. \"Professional rugby has never traded through a recession and it's going to be interesting to see how we do. But three English clubs are quite profitable and a number are there or thereabouts. If you look across Europe at the strength of the Irish provinces and the game in France you've got to make a step change. There's no doubt in my mind the boom in France will be sustained because football is so much smaller in their market.\"</p> <p>Certain exceptions do exist on this side of the Channel. Bristol are operating this season on a budget of about \u00a31m less than the salary cap of \u00a34m while Bath are still hamstrung by their continued failure to agree a deal to redevelop the Recreation Ground. But in the north and south of the country, the professional game has mushroomed from a few hundred bedraggled souls clutching pints on the touchline to five-figure average gates and more. </p> <p>\"There's no other sport in the country in the last 100 years that has built crowds like rugby union but it's still tough,\" Evans said. \"It's a long-term business. You can get them for a one-off game but persuading them to come every week is a different thing entirely.\" </p> <p>The other cautionary note relates to the structure of the coming year, as jam-packed as ever. If Wasps finish in the top four it will be an outstanding achievement as they will be releasing a minimum of 14 players to English senior or Saxons duty for chunks of the season under the new eight-year deal between the Rugby Football Union and the clubs. Without a decent start the champions could struggle to pull off their usual late power surge and Leicester will also need the early-season feelgood factor under Heyneke Meyer to translate into immediate points.</p> <p>Quins have made two astute signings in the All Black fly-half Nick Evans and the Argentinian centre Gonzalo Tiesi. Gloucester will be strong again but Sale's signing of the Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel may just prove the best piece of business of all. Underfoot conditions permitting, the likelihood must be that games will be conducted at a quicker pace under the experimental law variations and Peel's speed of thought and eye for a gap should allow Charlie Hodgson to unleash an exceptionally talented back division. Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 has the look of a man who will not tolerate another season of underachievement.</p> <p>Little mention here so far of Bristol or Newcastle, and that tells its own story. Richard Hill and Steve Bates are both good coaches and admirable rugby men but one of them looks set to endure a difficult winter. As for the top of the table, Gloucester, Sale, Leicester and Harlequins perhaps look best bets to make the end-of-season play-offs, with Wasps, Bath and Worcester also jostling for Europe. Credit crunch or not, a richly rewarding campaign awaits.</p> <h2>How the bookies see it</h2> <p><strong>Odds to finish top</strong></p> <p>Gloucester 3-1</p> <p>Leicester 3-1</p> <p>Wasps 7-2</p> <p>Bath 8-1</p> <p>Saracens 8-1</p> <p>Sale 9-1</p> <p>Harlequins 16-1</p> <p>London Irish 20-1</p> <p>Northampton 50-1</p> <p>Worcester 100-1</p> <p>Bristol 100-1</p> <p>Newcastle 125-1</p> <p><strong>Leading tryscorer</strong></p> <p>T Varndell 7-1</p> <p>L Vainikolo 8-1</p> <p>M Banahan 9-1</p> <p>J Simpson-Daniel 10-1</p> <p>C Ashton 12-1</p> <p>A Tuilagi 12-1</p>",
  "<p>London's 2012 Olympic village has a \u00a3250m funding shortfall that will have to be met from public money because the collapse of the housing market has made the project unviable for business, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Plans for the private sector to build more than 3,000 apartments for competitors on the Olympic campus in a \u00a31bn programme have been rocked by the credit crunch, which has made it harder to raise finance, and the slump in property values, which could damage the prospect of recouping money from sales after the games.</p> <p>Government officials have now admitted they are set to launch a rescue package. \"The Olympic Delivery Authority is doing all it can in difficult circumstances, but the property crunch and the credit crunch means we are looking at a funding gap of around \u00a3250m for the athletes' village at the moment,\" a senior government official said.</p> <p>The emergence of the significant new cost for the 2012 games ends a honeymoon period for London's Olympic organisers after last month's record-breaking medal haul in Beijing. The money will have to be found from the overall \u00a39.3bn of public funding set aside to stage the games, and the Treasury is understood to want most of the \u00a3250m to be found through cuts.</p> <p>Architects have already been ordered to reduce the number of apartments in the village by almost 1,000, which means during the games five athletes will have to share each apartment rather than four. A number of high-rise blocks in the village have been also scrapped.</p> <p>An announcement detailing the deal with Lend Lease, the property developer, will be made by the end of the year, the official added.</p> <p>The shortfall is on a par with the \u00a3265m of public money invested in Team GB to win 19 gold medals in Beijing.</p> <p>Olympic organisers insist any cash injection will not add to the overall \u00a39.3bn cost of building the games venues and providing security. They said it will be absorbed either by the \u00a32bn contingency included in the budget or by cuts elsewhere. </p> <p>But the man charged with building the venues for the London 2012 Olympics on time and on budget remains upbeat after the transforming effect of Beijing on public enthusiasm for the games.</p> <p>David Higgins, the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, an Australian who was involved in the build-up to the Sydney Olympics, told the Guardian: \"We no longer have to fight the battle of why the games is a good thing and why we are hosting them. Everyone understands what a big deal the games are and how exciting it is to have a successful team.\"</p> <p>Higgins declined to comment on the size of the bail-out, but said: \"We have a fair idea of how we can fund the village. We are advising the government on various options and we are working with Lend Lease, the banks, the funders and the housing association to look at them.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We make no bones about it, it is a very difficult market for housing, for property and for east London. Building 3,000 homes in one go is not something that anyone would normally do, let alone in this market.\"</p> <p>It represents the latest in a series of Olympic cost increases to be born by the taxpayer. When London won the bid for the event in Singapore in 2005, the overall budget estimate in the bid was \u00a33.4bn, including regeneration costs, but since then the cost of venues has soared. </p> <p>Higgins said the plans to build a partly permanent media facility which could become offices after the games are under review. The building has an estimated cost of \u00a3400m and one option being considered is to make it entirely temporary.</p> <p>Fencing has already been relocated to the Excel Centre. Plans for equestrianism to be held at Greenwich Park and shooting at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich are being reconsidered, and the temporary basketball arena could be abandoned and all of the basketball matches held at the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Higgins seems happiest with progress on the main stadium and the aquatics centre, the twin centrepieces of the Olympic park. Both have proved more costly than originally hoped. The aquatics centre is budgeted to cost \u00a3242m, compared to an original budget of \u00a373m, and the main stadium is on course to cost \u00a3496m, compared to \u00a3387m at 2012 prices.</p> <p>\"A lot of our people came back and said the games can cope with a lot of temporary [facilities] and it doesn't have to be perfect,\" said Higgins. \"People are quite comfortable going to rock concerts in Hyde Park and expect hoardings, crash fences, plastic barriers and cables everywhere. The same at Wimbledon and Chelsea Flower show. Everyone knows these are temporary events. This has more in common with that than building megastructures that will be there for a generation.\"</p> <p>The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wants to see change out of the \u00a39.3bn, while IOC president Jacques Rogge has made clear London must not fall short of the standards set by Beijing.</p> <p>Higgins said: \"We are positioning our games as a different games, not competing with Beijing. Some of these events only go for three days. Whereas in Beijing you went to see the Bird's Nest or the Water Cube, people will come and be encouraged to experience the games on screens, there will be lots of vegetation and lots of food. It will be like a typical English park.\"</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United's hierarchy came under scathing attack yesterday from both Alan Shearer and Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers Association, as Tyneside struggled to come to terms with life after Kevin Keegan.</p> <p>Indeed Joey Barton being banned for six games, rather than an expected 15, by the Football Association represented just about the only bit of good news for the club's directors.</p> <p>As Newcastle began the process of replacing Keegan, who resigned on Thursday, the board's modus operandi faced a twin attack, with Shearer not only ruling himself out but stating: \"I'd like to be a manager at some point but I want to control who comes in and out of the club.\"</p> <p>Describing the internal structure at St James' Park as \"strange\" the former Newcastle captain, added: \"If you've got three, four or five players waiting for you and you don't know who they are, then you've got the right to ask yourself, 'can I manage this club?' A manager lives and dies by his decisions. If he can't do that is there any point in him being there? It's dangerous when you go into a club and the director of football is not appointed by you.\"</p> <p>Shearer was clearly referring to Keegan's emasculation at the hands of Dennis Wise, Newcastle's all-powerful director of football, and Mike Ashley, the club's owner. He also expressed sympathy with disillusioned fans who have called for the removal of Ashley and Wise.</p> <p>\"They are angry, hurt, and disappointed and everyone feels for them, me included, because we all want the same thing - success at Newcastle United,\" he said. \"It's going to be a big task for [the board] because the fans are very angry.\"</p> <p>Bevan insisted that Ashley's largely London-based management structure was doomed to failure: \"If you look at a football club when people are running it from different parts of the country, when you've got a manager who doesn't know who is being signed, who is leaving and who is coming in, it's a recipe for disaster.</p> <p>\"Newcastle looked a bit like an orchestra with four conductors. It was going to break down sooner or later.\"</p> <p>As Keegan yesterday briefed lawyers to counter-claim against Newcastle for constructive dismissal, Barton also received a \u00a325,000 fine and a potential additional six-game ban, suspended until the end of the 2009-10 season, for his training-ground attack on Ousmane Dabo, then a Manchester City team-mate, in May 2007. The midfielder is scheduled to return on October 25 and can expect a hot reception as Newcastle are at Sunderland.</p> <p>While the favourite to become Barton's new manager remains Gus Poyet, Tottenham's No2 and a close ally of Wise's, Zico is also under consideration. Even so, the former Fenerbahce coach and Brazil luminary seems a less likely candidate than one of Wise's old Chelsea pals such as Poyet, Gianluca Vialli or Gianfranco Zola. Another strong candidate is Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, the Real Zaragoza coach.</p> <p>Dark horses include David O'Leary. The former Leeds United and Aston Villa manager is a close friend of Derek Llambias, Newcastle's managing director, and watched Newcastle's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal last Saturday as Llambias's guest.</p> <p>Despite his travails Keegan faxed information in support of Barton - who has served time in prison for a separate assault - to the FA's independent regulatory commission which included the former England manager Graham Taylor.</p>",
  "<p>The reader will be relieved to learn that in three of the stories in Fine Just the Way It Is, Annie Proulx's third collection of Wyoming tales, American naturalism is alive and well. The doctrine of free will is here flung down and danced upon. Characters born into a deterministic universe wherein daily life is physically and socially brutal make doomed attempts to flourish, but are cut down and ground to dust. They are granted glimpses of happiness, usually in the summer, but these are shortlived (as are the characters) and only increase the bitterness of their fate.</p> <p>\"Them Old Cowboy Songs\", the saddest of these stories, relates the history of Archie and Rose McLaverty, a 16-year-old orphan and his 14-year-old wife who, in 1885, stake out a homestead \"where the Little Weed comes rattling down from the Sierra Madre, water named not for miniature and obnoxious flora, but for PH Weed, a gold seeker who had starved near its source\". There's doom in that there creek name, and it comes rattling down on Rose and Archie, but first they have a blissful summer. They pass their evenings in lovemaking, \"their bed spread on the floor among the chips and splinters in the half-finished cabin\". One night, Rose, \"in some kind of transport\", turns her kisses to \"sharp nips\". When she feels her young husband shaking, she looks up to see \"his eyes closed, tears in his lashes, face contorted in a grimace:</p> <p>\"'Oh Archie, I didn't mean to hurt, Archie - '</p> <p>\"'You did not,' he groaned. 'It's. I ain't never been. Loved. I just can't hardly stand it - ' and he began to blubber 'feel like I been shot', pulling her into his arms, rolling half over so that the salty tears and his saliva wet her embroidered waist shirt, calling her his little birdeen, and at that moment she would have walked into a furnace for him.\"</p> <p>The strongest - and in some ways the strangest - story in the collection is called \"The Great Divide\". It too follows a young couple, Hi and Helen Alcorn, who set out to make a new life in a difficult environment. Hi Alcorn, a good-natured, optimistic sort, who has come through the Great War with only a slight limp and a deep contempt for the \"Frenchies\", watches his enterprises fail, one after the other, until he is forced to choose between working with his brother-in-law, Fenk Fipps - a brute who beats his wife and abuses the horses he rounds up for a living - and becoming a coalminer. It's a mythic choice. Hi loves the light and freedom of the plains, but he can't bear to witness Fenk's cruelty, so he opts to go down into the darkness.</p> <p>What sets this story apart from the others is a thematic density that reverberates in the reader's imagination long after the last line is over, a sense of the author's profound engagement with every ramification of the word \"divide\". It's not the longest story in the collection, but for my money, it's the deepest.</p> <p>\"Tits-Up in a Ditch\", a hilarious title for a grim tale, concerns the undoing of Dakotah Lister, whose 15-year-old mother, Shaina, disappeared the day after Dakotah was born, \"slinking and wincing, still in her hospital johnny, down the back stairs of Mercy Maternity to the street, where one of her greasy pals picked her up and headed west for Los Angeles\". From this unpromising beginning, Dakotah's life runs steadily downhill, through an early, unhappy marriage, the birth of a son, a stint in an army training camp in Missouri, and brief happiness in a friendship with a female soldier. They make their final trip together in a Humvee, \"Dakotah clutching a machine gun, on their way to a checkpoint to search Iraqi women\". It's a harrowing and riveting journey.</p> <p>Of the other stories, two are tall tales, concerning a homicidal sagebrush and a bloodthirsty stone bowl. There's a predictable cautionary tale about a young woman who gets into a snit and goes for a hike without her cellphone, and the longish saga of Ray Forkenbrock, who discovers at his father's funeral that the old man had several families.</p> <p>Two of the stories don't take place in Wyoming at all, but in hell, so one is justified in asking what in hell they are doing here. In one the devil is hot to redecorate the inferno, and in the other he intercepts an email in which a frustrated ornithologist complains, \"I'd sell my soul for a pterodactyl\". Scenting a Faustian pact, His Satanic Majesty sets out to close the deal. These are hardly stories at all, just running gags, not funny, but mercifully brief, and, like their protagonist, irredeemably bad.</p> <p>So there's a lot of range here, too varied for my taste, but then I've never lived out west. But the three excellent long stories that make up half the volume are well worth the price of entry, and if you enjoy a well-told tall tale, that runs it up to five out of nine - not a bad return for the gambling reader. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Valerie Martin's novels include Property (Abacus).</p>",
  "<p>I had the idea that I wanted to be a writer aged about 11 or so, and I made a book, which I illustrated and gave to my mother as a present. I must have been expecting some affirmation from her of previously undiscovered genius, because her reaction, though perfectly civil, failed to satisfy me, and I decided - and I remember thinking this exact phrase - that being a writer would be \"too lonely a profession\". Instead I decided I'd be an actress, based on nothing but my assumption that I could leave school early and bypass university. I never wanted to study. I wanted to make things. And so I singlemindedly followed this path. </p> <p>Without really paying it much attention, I did a lot of writing as an actress. At drama school we were encouraged to write in-depth biographies for each character, something I often found easier than the performances. Then, once out in the world, to give some structure to my unemployed days, I enrolled in a creative writing class run by the novelist Mich\u00e8le Roberts. I know now how rare it is to be with a group of people who are doing something purely for the pleasure of it. No one, as far as I knew, had ambitions to be published; everyone just loved being in that Monday morning classroom, finding, as the course promised, our voice. The following year I enrolled in an evening class, but this time the room was full of ambitious working people, the teacher brusque and critical. She asked each of us to write a long piece and read it out to the class, and so, never having written anything longer than 500 words and convinced I had nothing to write about, I wrote a story based on my Moroccan childhood. \"I think you should continue with that,\" came the terse response, which I accepted as the high praise it was. </p> <p>It took me another four years to discipline myself to make any real headway. By the age of 26 I had 40 pages and two pieces of advice from an Arvon tutor: one, to work on my novel every day; and two, to abandon the complicated structure of flashbacks I'd adopted, and tell my story from the beginning. But I didn't know how to do either of these things. I didn't know how to resist all the myriad distractions of my life and I didn't know the whole story of the 18 months I'd spent travelling with my mother and sister in north Africa. Just make it up, the tutor suggested, and so one day I began. Or to be truthful, I was forced into beginning, after a miserable six months during which, reeling with heartache from a split with a boyfriend, I'd taken a job that involved removing my clothes and performing naked on the Edinburgh stage, wearing nothing but a blond wig. Now here I was again, home, unemployed and alone. </p> <p>Right, I decided, I had to take some control, and so I resolved to work on my book every morning for three hours, until something fantastic happened (ideally a world tour with the RSC) that meant I would be allowed to stop. At first it was a struggle, and every day I had to force myself to start, but soon, as my memories revealed themselves, and my imagination ignited, I was caught up in a secret world of my own making. I'd never been so happy. I'd been telling stories all my life, often just to myself, and now they came pouring out. I wanted to show what it had been like to be the conventional child of rebellious and unconventional parents, the confusion and humour of the situation, the warmth and closeness, the safety and fear of being in a foreign country, the beauty of that country, the kindness of the people. I visited my mother regularly and listened, a tape recorder between us, while she remembered her earlier life for me. As soon as I got home I'd turn her memories round and imagine what my protagonist, a girl of five, would have been thinking. </p> <p>And the more I thought about Morocco, the more I remembered it. The sunsets, the smells, the scorched earth, the cool of the courtyard tiles. It did occur to me that it might be easier to go back there, but I was too superstitious. What if the minute I stepped off the plane all my memories evaporated? I decided to reward myself with a research trip once the book was finished, and 14 months later I did go back. I stood outside the tiny airport and looked up at the stars glinting in the velvet sky, breathed in the dust and heat smell of the night, and allowed myself to hope, wildly, that I'd got it right. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Next week John Mullan will discuss readers' responses to the novel</p>",
  "<p>Italy's most planted red wine grape, sangiovese is the underpinning of the majority of central Italian reds - notably Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, as well as Rosso Conero and Rosso Piceno. </p> <p>Also known as brunello, morellino and prugnolo gentile, sangiovese can vary dramatically in quality, from the lacklustre, over-produced vines responsible for the lightest Sangiovese di Romagna to the dense, long-lived Brunello. </p> <p>Late-ripening sangiovese makes well-structured, often high-acid wines with a certain farmyard character, but a dense pruney character if fully ripe. </p> <p><strong>Italy </strong></p> <p>By law, Chianti Classico must be between 80% and 100% sangiovese, and is blended with the traditional canaiolo, colorino and certain \"international varieties\" (notably cabernet sauvignon and merlot); Vino Nobile di Montepulciano (not to be confused with the montepulciano grape used to make Montepulciano d'Abruzzo) must be at least 70%. Sangiovese is the sole grape officially permitted for Brunello di Montalcino, and is also an important component, with merlot and cabernet sauvignon, in the so-called \"Supertuscans\". Beyond Tuscany, it is widely planted in Umbria, the Marche and Lazio, and can also be found as far afield as Lombardy and Valpolicella to the north and Campania to the south.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Like other Italian grapes, sangiovese was taken west to North and South America by Italian emigrants, and it has so far shown itself to be a slightly happier traveller than Italy's other major red grape, nebbiolo. It turns out some sumptuous (and some overpriced) wines in California and Washington state, the odd Australian and some generally less inspiring examples in Argentina, mainly Mendoza.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Piccini Orange Label Chianti 2006, Italy</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99, Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p>Sangiovese finds its truest expression in Chianti, most of which is frankly undrinkable at this price.

  "<p>Everything about the Beaujolais grape gamay is hasty. It can ripen somewhere as cool as the Loire. The grape is officially known as gamay noir \u00e0 jus blanc, in recognition of its pale flesh. The wines tend to be light-coloured, often with a blue tinge. They traditionally attract the vague adjectives \"fresh and fruity\". Rapid vinification using carbonic maceration (where the grapes are fermented whole before crushing, with the help of carbon dioxide), to hasten Beaujolais nouveau to market, can result in strong aromas of bananas and pear drops. Most gamay should be drunk young. Low tannins and high acidity mean it can be served chilled. </p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>On the third Thursday of November each year, banners go up around France proclaiming: \"Le Beaujolais nouveau est arriv\u00e9!\" What started as a local celebration became a widespread and successful marketing ploy, which drew worldwide attention to the race from grape to glass (achieved in as little as six weeks). What the emphasis on youth has tended to obscure is the more serious, sophisticated Beaujolais made in the region's 10 crus: Juli\u00e9nas, Saint-Amour, Ch\u00e9nas, Moulin-\u00e0-Vent, Fleurie, Chiroubles, Morgon, R\u00e9gni\u00e9, Brouilly and C\u00f4te de Brouilly. Such bottles may name only the cru, rather than Beaujolais itself - but Beaujolais it is. Wines not from these crus will be labelled simply Beaujolais or (slightly superior) Beaujolais-Villages.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Gamay is also grown in M\u00e2connais, to the north of Beaujolais, and in the Loire heartland of Touraine, as well as outlying areas such as Ch\u00e2teaumeillant, Coteaux du Giennois, C\u00f4tes d'Auvergne, C\u00f4tes du Forez, C\u00f4te Roannaise and St-Pour\u00e7ain. In M\u00e2connais and Switzerland, gamay is often blended with a bit of pinot noir to produce Bourgogne Passetoutgrains and D\u00f4le respectively. Outside France, only the Swiss are particularly keen on gamay, although it can be found in parts of central Europe. It has been confused with blaufr\u00e4nkisch. Some is planted in Hawke's Bay in New Zealand. The Californian grape variety gamay Beaujolais is in fact an early-ripening clone of pinot noir.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Asda Beaujolais NV, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a33.76, Asda</strong></p> <p>Even at this low price, the exuberant red berries backgrounded with a chalky texture you hope to find in a gamay have not been squeezed out.

  "<p>Rosemary James has recently completed an LLB law degree at the University of Strathclyde. She is looking for a job as an arts administrator in a gallery and has applied for 30 positions in the last two months with no success. We asked two professionals to give a critique of her CV. </p> <h2>Presentation</h2> <p><strong>Simon Baddeley, senior regional service manager, Reed Specialist Recruitment (<a href=\"http://www.reed.co.uk\">reed.co.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>Although Rosemary's CV is the correct length - two pages - it seems long as it is packed with information. Personal information can be kept to a minimum; you simply need to insert your name and telephone or mobile number. It's not necessary to put your home address and date of birth.</p> <p>I would recommend that Rosemary <strong>removes the long list of modules she has completed in her various degrees</strong>, as these are irrelevant to the role she is applying for. <strong>As Rosemary has plenty of work experience, I would group this according to paid work and volunteer/unpaid work</strong>. At present, it appears as though she jumped from one role to another and some companies have been mentioned twice. It is also worth noting any key skills gained from these various roles, rather than listing all duties undertaken.</p> <p>Rosemary could benefit from improving the appearance of her CV. <strong>The essay-style layout makes it difficult to see subheadings and pull out key points </strong>. This can be addressed with bullet points to highlight roles and skills and by <strong>using white spaces between different sections</strong> so a potential employer can skim through the different parts of the CV easily. </p> <p>It's important to show your personality in a CV, otherwise you won't stand out from the crowd. This means ensuring that your CV is not a rambling essay. <strong>Although Rosemary has a quirky email address, which suggests she is a fun person, it isn't very professional</strong>. I would keep personal and professional email addresses separate. </p> <h2>Employability</h2> <p><strong>Gwyn Davies, service improvement officer, Manchester City Galleries (<a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org\">manchestergalleries.org</a>)</strong></p> <p>I think overall Rosemary needs to concentrate on highlighting her interest in the arts and why she'd like to go into arts administration. </p> <p>The museums and galleries sector is particularly competitive and we often see huge numbers of overqualified graduates applying for positions. To convince us she has the staying power for her first job in the arts, she really needs to emphasise her enthusiasm for the sector. </p> <p>In her Skills and Interests section <strong>she could explain in more detail which particular areas of the arts she is interested in</strong>, and how she has participated; for example, whether she regularly visits exhibitions, or the theatre. </p> <p>To create more room to do this, she could <strong>cut down on the detail of some of her work experience</strong>. Only a little of what she's done to date seems to be particularly relevant to the sector, which could be a disadvantage - so she needs to make more of the arts experience she does have. I'd suggest she summarises her waitressing and other less relevant experience to a line or two. </p> <p>Rosemary's administrative experience seems to be fairly comprehensive, and her writing skills are good, so I think she could easily transfer these skills to a post in arts administration. <strong>She should definitely highlight these skills as they are important</strong>.</p> <p>In this sector, job openings of this kind are few and far between. But if Rosemary is very keen and perhaps can couple her search with some voluntary work, her persistence should pay off in the end. Unfortunately it is often difficult for people to carry out voluntary work when they need to earn a salary, but it is still a very effective way of breaking into paid employment in this sector. </p> <h2>Was it helpful?</h2> <p><strong>Rosemary says: </strong>I agree with the comments Simon made about removing the long list of modules I studied at university.

  "<p>Every writer has a \"How I became a writer\" story. It's what interviewers and audiences always ask for, and quite understandably; some explanation is needed for embarking on a course of conduct so egotistic, impoverishing and bizarre. Some authors reply sweetly: \"I was born a writer.\" Most of us struggle to separate \"how\" from \"why\". The initial impetus is lost in a murky swamp of happenstance. I sometimes say that I wrote my first book because it didn't exist, and I wanted to read it. That's true as far as it goes, but if I am asked about \"influences\" I find it hard to give a slick answer. Some of us need a little push, before we recognise we have the right to pick up a pen. In my case it came from a book by the psychiatrists RD Laing and Aaron Esterson, Sanity, Madness and the Family.</p> <p>Laing was the better-known partner in this collaboration. In the 1960s and 70s, he was fashionable and famous. His cultural influence has lasted, though some wish otherwise; his work reinforced the scepticism many feel about the biological basis of mental and emotional distress. But he died in 1989, and if you mention him nowadays you are likely to be met with stories of his disorderly private life, or with a distorted version of his work. He didn't, as some claimed, accuse parents of making their children schizophrenic; he interrogated the whole idea of schizophrenia as a clinical entity. He was exceptionally alive to language and gesture, to the layers of meaning in every utterance; alive, also, to power play, to conscious and unconscious manipulations. He had seen the pain, terror and desolation of madness. He did not glamorise it or claim it didn't exist. He and his co-workers suggested that the way some families worked could generate psychotic behaviour in one member, who was selected, more or less unconsciously, to bear the brunt of family dysfunction. </p> <p>I picked up his book one afternoon in 1973 and read it in one sitting. The people in it seemed close enough to touch. I had already read Laing's more famous work, The Divided Self, and I wasn't sure I entirely grasped it; its case histories made my heart sink, but I struggled with its abstractions. But Sanity, Madness and the Family is vivid, direct, gripping. It is a series of interviews with families, who each include one member who has spent time in psychiatric hospitals. Each interview is a novel or play in miniature. The material was gathered between 1958 and 1963, so the families described still live in the shadow of the second world war. They are very different, on the surface, from families today, but I wonder if the dynamics have changed so much. The ploys, the shifts of sense, the secrets and the ambivalence still seem familiar. </p> <p>In the hospitals where Laing had trained, it was axiomatic that doctors and nurses didn't \"talk to psychosis\". The patient was sick and generating nonsense, and you should not encourage it. Laing thought that, if you listened, the patient would tell you how her world worked; the language might be metaphorical, even surreal, but that was logical in a context where plain speech had been penalised and where children had been taught, as they grew, to distrust their own perception and memory, and give way to the memories and perceptions of others. In Laing's families, there is always a version behind the version. There are truths one member is allowed to air, that another member is forbidden to utter. The weakest finds him or herself in a lose-lose situation, unable to please, locked in a circuit of invalidation. Madness may, in some circumstances, seem a strategy for survival. </p> <p>All this is played out in the pages of interviews, in trite little words that I cannot quote without the space to set the scene for each. So many of these family conversations seemed familiar to me: their swerves and evasions, their doubleness. All the patients profiled in the book are young women. I know their names are pseudonyms, but over the years I've wondered desperately what happened to them, and if there's anyone alive who knows, and whether any of them ever cut free from the choking knotweed of miscommunication and flourished on ground of their own: Ruth, who was thought odd because she wore coloured stockings; Jean, who wanted a baby though her whole family told her she didn't; and Sarah, whose breakdown, according to her family, was caused by too much thinking. In the course of the recorded conversations, their families trip and contradict them. The interviewer records their signals - winks, smirks, nods - and how, when the \"mad\" member protests, they say: \"What, me? I didn't do anything.\" Barefaced lies are countenanced, as being for the patient's own good. Left is right, up is down, and, often enough, your mother's your sister, and your father's not your father. </p> <p>Laing asked his reader: \"Is it what you already knew, expected, suspected? Do these things go on in all sorts of families? Possibly.\" I looked at my own home and drew some conclusions; after all, it is class and context that select some families, and not others, for \"interventions\". You didn't find social workers and mad-doctors knocking on suburban doors, and if my own friends were in trouble they just stopped eating, bearing smiling and skeletal witness to long-running family tensions. </p> <p>There is a right time to read every book, and 1973 was the time for me to read this one. I was a law student, and a placement with the probation service had put me on the alert for what is coldly described as multiple family dysfunction. On Manchester high-rise estates I had seen the sour human comedy enacted: dad pickled in alcohol, mum a nervy chain-smoking wreck, son a \"young offender\" caught up in a spiral of petty crime, pregnant daughter banging on the doors of the nearest psychiatric unit. Ah, the 70s: what a golden age! I was struck by how the men acted and the women reacted, how sons fought and thieved but daughters fell ill. I needed to see my instincts systematised, and when I read Laing, the dynamics were suddenly clear. For most of my life I had been told that I didn't know how the world worked. That afternoon I decided I did know, after all. In the course of my 21 years I'd noticed quite a lot. If I wanted to be a writer, I didn't have to worry about inventing material, I'd already got it. The next stage was just to find some words.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Vote for me ... please</strong><br>We may well be two years from a general election, but already the bribes have started to appear. Gordon Brown this week unveiled a package of measures designed to save his skin ... er, sorry, revive the battered housing market. The headline-grabbing move was the suspension of stamp duty on houses costing less than \u00a3175,000. Ministers have temporarily raised the threshold at which 1% stamp duty is paid from \u00a3125,000, a change that will save eligible homebuyers up to \u00a31,750. And there was yet another revamp of the government's dog-eared HomeBuy shared equity scheme. The new version aims to help up to 10,000 first-time buyers into negative equity ... sorry, home ownership.</p> <p><strong>Thanks, Darling </strong><br>If that doesn't tickle your fancy, how about if chancellor Alistair Darling were to stuff a few tenners into your pocket, with the promise of more to come? Well, you're in luck. As many as 22 million people are set to receive an extra \u00a360 in their wage packets this month - money that will be a welcome boost for millions of households feeling the pinch. It's the result of changes following the 10p tax U-turn this year. As well as the lump sum of \u00a360 in their September wages, most people under 65 who pay basic rate tax of 20% will enjoy a \u00a310 increase in their take-home pay each month after that until the new tax year in April, say accountants KPMG. That adds up to a not-to-be-sniffed-at \u00a3120.</p> <p><strong>Cashing in </strong><br>You've just got back from holiday and you've got a bit of foreign currency in your wallet or purse. What do you do with it? Most people tend to stuff any unused euros or dollars in a drawer in anticipation of their next trip abroad. But Travelex.co.uk says it has seen a big leap in number of holidaymakers converting spare currency into pounds on their return. It's the latest evidence that, in these credit-crunched times, we are keen to get our hands on every piece of spare cash that we can.</p> <p><strong>Married in a 5p dress </strong><br>More news from the credit crunch frontline. Heather Saint is delighted after buying her dream wedding dress on eBay for a mere 5p.

It's made by a designer from Singapore. There was a \u00a340 postage charge, but the dress itself was just 5p.\"</p> <p><strong>Winning smile </strong><br>Forget the Mona Lisa, Julia Roberts has the best smile of all time. New research reveals that, 18 years after her starring role as prostitute Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman, almost half the great British public reckon Roberts has the most beautiful and genuine smile around. Some will be surprised to see The X Factor main man Simon Cowell ranked second - though the striking size and glowing whiteness of his and fellow judge Cheryl Cole's gnashers have certainly been a talking point among those of us with the teeth of mere mortals. Victoria Beckham topped the list of worst fake smilers.

Ahmad Akhtary, 34, got hold of a mock-up death certificate from Afghanistan, stating he had died of \"brain trauma\" after an accident. His British ex-wife then put in a claim to Norwich Union for the \u00a3300,000 on their shared policy, a court heard. Akhtary's deception was uncovered because he continued to live a full and visible life in Gloucester, working in a factory and paying tax. They were sentenced to nine months in jail, suspended for two years.</p>",
  "<p>It's a neat way to ditch probably the most hated tax in the country: scrap council tax and replace it with a local income tax. The Scottish National Party has gone furthest down this road, outlining this week how its local income tax plan will save the average Scottish family between \u00a3350 and \u00a3535 per year.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are big fans, too. Why, they ask, are local taxes based on property values nearly 20 years ago, instead of what people can afford to pay today?</p> <p>\"It's about localising power, too. Because, with a local income tax in place, we can decentralise our tax system - transferring tax-raising powers from national to local government,\" says Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg.</p> <p>But let's see how this would work in practice. For a start, imagine the mess in your employer's pay department. Would it be their job to deduct, say, 3.15p in the pound on my earnings as I live in Southwark, but 3.14p to a colleague in Harrow and maybe 3.09p to one who lives in Hertfordshire?</p> <p>Or leave it to councils to endlessly pursue everybody in the borough for their P60s - including students who work during term time and vacations? Which councils would obtain their local tax revenue?</p> <p>Putting aside the practicalities, a local income tax would have other highly undesirable outcomes. Let's take two identical semi-detached homes. In one lives a single pensioner on a total income of \u00a315,000 a year, in the other a family with two children where both parents work and have a combined income of \u00a348,000. The family struggle with a huge mortgage, while the pensioner has paid off his - and has some decent savings to rely on as well.</p> <p>Scrap council tax and the family will pay more in the form of local income tax, while the pensioner will pay less.</p> <p>The incentive for pensioners to move to smaller properties and release family homes on to the market also disappears.</p> <p>Local income tax also broadens the net to cover many more individuals than currently pay council tax.</p> <p>But what I find most puzzling is why we are so keen to tax income, but not wealth and property.</p> <p>The Tories were at it again this week, promising a \u00a31m or even \u00a32m tax shelter for wealthy families when they pass on estates at death. This measure to protect the rich was being sold to the middle classes, worried that their \"average\" properties would fall into the inheritance tax (IHT) trap.</p> <p>When Labour last year caved in to demands to raise the threshold, many people argued IHT should be indexed to house prices. I wonder how many of them will be arguing today that IHT bands should be lowered by 10% now that property prices have slumped?</p> <p>Last week I was rung by my bank out of the blue but, before the operator would proceed, I was told I had to give my security details. Er, no, I said. How can I be sure you are who you say you are?</p> <p>The next day, lastminute.com rang about a hotel booking. Again, they wanted me to answer security questions before proceeding with the call.</p> <p>In both cases I asked for a switchboard number I could ring, so ensuring the caller was genuine.</p> <p>This request flummoxed both organisations. Lastminute was completely unable to offer a switchboard number, while my bank passed me from one operator to the next until it eventually found one.</p> <p>These are worrying times for ID fraud. Why don't companies have procedures that let us check their details, rather than the other way round? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.collinson@theguardian.com\">p.collinson@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Middle-aged historian Dr John Goode has cleared a week to prepare an important conference paper which he is depending upon to revive his career. He has packed his wife and children off, settled into his study-nook under the stairs and clipped the magazine into his newly acquired automatic assault rifle. Perhaps you can spot the deliberate incongruity here.</p> <p>Goode is not, of course, supposed to be fooling around with automatic weapons. His problem is that, having succumbed to a spot of displacement activity repotting plum trees in his garden, he was first alarmed, then intrigued, when his spade hit a hard, metallic object. Good sense would dictate notifying the police, though that would have come with the risk of a SWAT team descending and a lengthy period of questioning putting paid to his work on the conference paper. Less good sense dictates that he attempt to dismantle and dispose of the gun himself, which permits even less time for academic composition but makes for a much funnier novel.</p> <p>Hawes's narrative hinges on the simple satirical conceit of equipping an archetypal, pacifistic liberal with a terroristic instrument of aggression, then monitoring how long it takes for his trigger finger to itch. Goode soon manages to overcome his irrational fear of firepower - a spot of web research brings him to the conclusion that \"it's a power tool, really . . . Nothing scary or mythical whatever once you get your hands on it and your brain round it\".</p> <p>Of course, a little knowledge makes a dangerous thing more dangerous than ever; and the crux of the story is that Goode, having inadvertently slipped the rifle into firing mode, must learn how to make it safe again without arousing suspicion. So his academic work is supplanted by a shooting trip to Prague, the go-to place for those who want to mess around with guns; for which Goode must concoct a plausible cover story. Thus he arranges to meet the subject on whom he has constructed his career, a radical East German poet-turned-politician who delivers a serious blow to Goode's academic trajectory when he is revealed to have been a member of the KGB.</p> <p>From his flashy debut, A White Merc With Fins, to the more considered Speak for England three years ago, Hawes has developed into a prolifically inventive and increasingly subtle satirist. Though the current novel features all his regular trademarks - black humour, sharp dialogue and a plot that goes off with all guns blazing in every respect - one senses that this book is also Hawes's homage to one of the great academic satires of the last century, Malcolm Bradbury's The History Man.</p> <p>In 1975 Bradbury presented Howard Kirk, a sociology lecturer whose complacent radicalism provides theoretical justification for rampant egotism and intellectual hypocrisy. Like Kirk, Goode seems to be in academia only for what he can get out of it: he admits that, \"like most people who study East Germany, I really did not like the place very much\". Yet his greatest sense of injustice is rooted in the fact that the collapse of the Warsaw Pact caused irrevocable damage to his salary package; and life on the margins of respectability, with no decent primary schools and \"carfuls of hooded little sods rattling our sash windows at three in the morning\", is enough to give rise to all manner of illiberal thoughts, not least when one has an automatic weapon to enforce them.</p> <p>Goode tends to shoot his mouth off more readily than his rifle, which can make him a wearying narrator at times, prone to rather predictable rants about hoodies, mortgage advisers and the people in front of him at the check-in queue. But, as Goode protests, \"the world must be full of ex-lefties riddled with despair, bafflement and shame\". It's the cri de coeur of a history man who wakes up one morning to find himself consigned to history.</p>",
  "<p>The political catastrophe of Bush-era America has been vivid enough to penetrate even the rather placidly apolitical literary life. With the litany of horrors lengthening every day, it's hard to stay focused on your coming-of-age novel, your new poem about the fall foliage. War-on-terror subplots start sprouting; your maple-gazing dissolves into thoughts about Guant\u00e1namo . . . However, it's surprisingly hard to incorporate this material into the standard literary forms. Fiction and poetry have a way of making full-on indignation sound like self-righteousness, while a more oblique approach prompts the question: what is there to be oblique about with torture, rendition, vote-rigging?</p> <p>Aleksandar Hemon's The Lazarus Project is one of several recent books that orbit these subjects. Its sentiments are all very correct and laudable, but as a novel it seems to me largely a failure. It opts, initially, for the oblique angle: in this case, historical analogy, along the lines of Miller's The Crucible, with the anarchist scare of the early 20th century forming its point of entry into the contemporary hysteria. </p> <p>In March 1908 a young Jewish immigrant to Chicago, Lazarus Averbuch, made an unannounced visit to the chief of police, George Shippy, at his home. Lazarus appears to have had little or no connection with the anarchist movement, and nothing more menacing in mind than the delivery of a letter. But in a blunderingly stupid over-reaction, Shippy took him for an assassin, and shot him dead. A brutal round-up of Averbuch's associates followed, along with beatings, public denunciations and the wreckage of innocent lives; all conducted in a frenzy of patriotic rhetoric about sinister people of Middle Eastern origin sabotaging the Land of the Free.</p> <p>The parallels with today are obvious, and one can see why Hemon was attracted to the case. But the drawing of parallels doesn't in itself make a novel, and once the reader gets the point (scraps of handwriting in Lazarus's pocket mistaken for coded terror instructions, and so on), the question arises of what else to do with the story. Period reconstruction clearly isn't Hemon's game: his turn-of-the-century Chicago is thinly sketched, stocked with throwaway caricatures of thuggish cops, humbly virtuous immigrants and pompously self-serving journalists. What seem to interest him more are the various practical and metaphysical questions raised by his own desire to tell the story. The result is a familiar postmodern construction: a novel about the writing of a novel. </p> <p>Framing the historical material in a contemporary investigation, Hemon gives us Vladimir Brik, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 Bosnian newspaper columnist in Chicago, who has been awarded a generous grant to research Lazarus Averbuch. (Hemon himself is an \u00e9migr\u00e9 to Chicago from the former Yugoslavia, and the recipient of a MacArthur \"Genius\" grant.) An old photographer friend from his Sarajevo days, Rora, suggests they take a trip together to Lazarus's birthplace, and the two set off for Ukraine and Moldova. </p> <p>The journey, intercut with the Lazarus story (and illustrated by some Sebaldesque photographs), gives Brik an opportunity to improvise on whatever subject he feels like talking about - war, history, America, his unravelling marriage, the blighted landscapes and seedy hotel rooms they pass through - and to relay his companion's yarns about war-torn Sarajevo, while intermittently musing on Lazarus and dreamily transferring images from his own life into that of his subject.</p> <p>Lacking the pressure of a plot, these passages stake everything on their pure interest as writing. Hemon has shown himself capable of writing well in previous books - some of his short stories are particularly impressive - but a pall seems to have fallen over him here. Tired observations, lame jokes, bits of generic travelogue about smelly buses and scary taxi-rides form the bulk of these sections. You could make an anthology of mediocre prose and stale routines from them. There's the sub-Amis car-name punning: \"The Ford Focus smelled of feces.\" There are lengthy tracts of what Adrienne Rich famously called \"bullshit eloquence\", as in this little maelstrom of verbal registers and half-cocked notions: \"Never mind Mr Christ's eschatological circus - there must be the post-orgasmic moment of absolute peace, of coming home, the moment when the fog of life floats away like gun smoke and everything is finally nothing.\" There's the annoying mannerism, as in the repeated use of \"but\" in its archaic sense: \"the narrative went completely haywire and I became but a confused character within it\". And so on.</p> <p>As that last quote suggests, a part of the problem may be the lack of a powerful governing idea. The two pals go to a casino, they visit a Jewish centre, traipse through a cemetery, drink coffee, encounter prostitutes and thugs, but there's little sense of what Hemon really wants from these scenes; almost no feeling of a situation or theme being interestingly advanced. There's also a tendency for action to be presented at one remove or more from reality. Brik's marriage, which preoccupies him greatly, occurs entirely offstage, which makes its demise a matter of little interest to the reader; likewise Rora's adventures during the Sarajevo siege, which have the further disadvantage of seeming both untrue and unconnected to anything else in the book.</p> <p>Towards the end The Lazarus Project seems to realise it's running on empty. Nervous jokes about its narrator's self-absorption begin to appear. And as if desperate to break out of its own muffled torpor, it becomes suddenly sensationalistic. There's an ill-judged attempt to \"do\" the Kishinev pogrom, which manages to be both inadequate and overwritten. And then, out of nowhere, Brik and Rora turn into knights errant, punching out a sex-trafficker in a Bucharest toilet. How random, as my kids would say.</p> <p>Hemon's two previous books were justly praised. I had high hopes for this one. It's been ages since I felt this disappointed.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> James Lasdun's most recent novel is Seven Lies (Vintage).</p>",
  "<p>The subtitle for the US edition of this book was Dispatches From America's Class War. You might think it would be the Americans, not the British, who would run a mile from publishing a book with the phrase \"class war\" in its title. Class is not even meant to exist there, whereas everyone here knows that it does. </p> <p>Joe Bageant argues that class is very much alive in the US: an \"American hologram\" in which every citizen props up an iniquitous structure in order to protect a redundant dream of wealth and self-actualisation. The class war is fought cold - with words, reproaches, snubs and deliberate mishearings - between mostly urban liberals and largely rural conservatives, who snipe at each other from class-segregated homes, bars and schools. </p> <p>Almost by definition - as Bageant illustrates with painful statistics on Americans' illiteracy (apparently nearly half can't read or write fluently) - any book about class must take the form of explaining working-class life to middle-class people. \"It is as if your people were some sort of exotic, as if you were from Yemen or something,\" an editor from New York once told him. </p> <p>He can oblige with great insight and validity because he is of working-class Appalachian stock: his mother worked in a textile mill, while his dad ran a gas station on behalf of its owner. He grew up in and in later life returned to the poor North End of Winchester, Virginia, after many years spent in various shades of countercultural penury, first as an anti-war activist (he served in Vietnam), then as a teacher and writer.</p> <p>His hippy adventures brought about in him a kind of wild-eyed lucidity when regarding the spectre of American capitalism, while his background gives him licence to be plain rude. Bageant believes, without question, that a majority of white working-class and poor Americans voted for Bush in 2000 and 2004 because they are stupid. </p> <p>More precisely, they are \"downright stupid\", \"dumber than owl shit\". Even worse, Christian fundamentalist schools, \"those American madrassas\", are \"a sure way to make the masses even more stupid if there was one\". </p> <p>One imagines he'll have to stand a lifetime's worth of rounds to keep his table at the Royal Lunch, a real-life Moe's Tavern whose regulars provide Bageant with enough saloon-bar philosophy to begin their own school. His old schoolfriend, Tom, trots out the clich\u00e9s as though he doesn't even believe them himself, which may well be the case. </p> <p>\"Life is tough,\" he offers. \"Stick with what you know.\" He really does believe, however, that George W Bush \"cuts bush on his ranch\" while John Kerry, the losing Democrat in 2004, goes \"windsurfing at Martha's Vineyard. Who the hell goes windsurfing?\" Lots of people do, of course; just no one who drinks at the Royal Lunch.</p> <p>With that logic - a rough one at best, argues Bageant, comprising \"things that sound as if they might be true\" - a president dedicated to cutting taxes for the rich while allowing your meagre income to stall will beat the principled posho every time.</p> <p>What makes this book especially valuable is that every word is motivated by rage, rather than righteous indignation. Richard Sennett's famous \"hidden injuries of class\" aren't so much exposed as paraded like war wounds. Bageant wouldn't be able to stifle his anger if he tried, but he is able to control and direct it into mostly graceful - and when not graceful, funny - prose. </p> <p>His defence of gun ownership, which requires a chapter's worth of iteration, can be summed up as \"It's in my blood\", but evokes movingly the psychological value of heirlooms and apprenticeship. He connects the \"slow life\" with dignity and mastery, qualities he sees falling away from the lives around him. That he is sometimes faced with a split-second mental image of shooting another human dead appears to be the cost. </p> <p>The chapters on religious fundamentalism and healthcare are more shocking, given that gun ownership, from this side of the water, seems such a uniquely American signal of class division. A third of working Americans earn less than $9 an hour - the same workers who fund Christian colleges they are unlikely ever to attend, who buy $39,000 cars on credit, and who have no health insurance.</p> <p>Ignorance, Bageant concludes, is the greatest enemy of working-class Americans: not terrorism, or drugs, or illegals, but sheer daftness. It works both ways, with powerful leaders refusing to fund public schools properly and condescending to voters least likely to revolt, and rednecks making a creed out of mistrust and closed-mindedness. Class enslaves the mind. It's not the first time it's been said, but it may be the first time anyone has said it so well, and in the land of the free. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lynsey Hanley's Estates: An Intimate History is published by Granta</p>",
  "<h2>1969 Frank Kermode</h2> <p>The first judges were Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, David Farrer and WL Webb, at that time literary editor of the Guardian. We were handsomely treated: in London we haunted Bertorelli\u2019s, but we spent more than one weekend at Michael Astor\u2019s beautiful Cotswold house, where Dame Rebecca strode the grounds authoritatively between bouts of laying down the law. There were perhaps 60 books, which seemed a lot, though modern judges are said to read twice as many. Getting through the 60 was made easier by our not daring to take on Dame Rebecca. \u201cMiss Murdoch writes good and bad novels in alternate years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a bad year.\u201d Muriel Spark: \u201cclever but too playful.\u201d And out they went. </p> <p>Two of us favoured Nicholas Mosley\u2019s Impossible Object, but were soon silenced. The choice of PH Newby\u2019s Something to Answer For was the result of a compromise. Dame Rebecca didn\u2019t dislike it as much as nearly all the others. Surveyors of the prize\u2019s history have spoken ill of this good book, perhaps without reading it, or by being too ready to suppose that this industrious writer could manage a novel a year as well as running the Third Programme. Anyway, I remember this, my one experience of judging, with much pleasure and amusement.</p> <h2>1970 Antonia Fraser</h2> <p>The judging of the 1970 prize was a low-key affair except for the feisty behaviour of Dame Rebecca West, a judge for the second year running. At one point she denounced Margaret Drabble for her novels of domestic life on the grounds that \u201cAnyone can do the washing-up; just get a big bowl and some liquid; so why complain about it?\u201d The novel in question was The Waterfall, which both Richard Hoggart and I admired greatly (and didn\u2019t think was about washing-up). I knew Rebecca West, since she was a friend and neighbour of my parents in Sussex, and was very fond of her; all the same, it occurred to me that she was possibly one of the brilliant old ladies who felt threatened by a brilliant young one in the shape of Maggie Drabble. In the end we were split between William Trevor\u2019s Mrs Eckdorf in O\u2019Neill\u2019s Hotel and Bernice Rubens\u2019s The Elected Member. I voted for Rubens but today would vote for Trevor. </p> <p>1971 was much more exacting. The most exciting thing that happened to me as a Booker Judge for the second time was not controversial. I shared a taxi back with fellow judge Saul Bellow on a long, long ride from somewhere in the City: he was nattily dressed in a pale green shantung suit, blue shirt, green tie with large blue dots on it; his silver hair and slanting, large dark eyes made him look like a 30s film star playing a refined gangster. Suddenly he leaned forward and asked: \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re a very handsome woman?\u201d I pondered on a suitable reply, modest yet encouraging. But having spoken, the Great Man closed his eyes and remained apparently asleep for the rest of the journey.</p> <h2>1971 John Gross</h2> <p>A faint aroma of the Nobel prize - or of Nobel prizes yet to come - hangs over the 1971 Booker. First, the award went to VS Naipaul (who was to be Nobel laureate in 2001) for In a Free State. It was a result with which I agreed. Second, the organisers had succeeded in persuading a distinguished writer from abroad to be one of the judges: Saul Bellow (who was to be Nobel laureate in 1976). It seemed a thrilling prospect.</p> <p>In the event, one of the things I remember most clearly about Bellow is that he insisted on being put up at the Ritz (which must have burned a big hole in the budget), and then complained because he hadn\u2019t been given a room overlooking Green Park.</p> <p>Another recollection is his response when I advanced the claims of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont, which apart from the Naipaul was the book on the shortlist I most favoured. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s one of those little tinkling teacup things that the British always do well.\u201d He was quite wrong - Mrs Palfrey is a work of deep feeling - but his dismissiveness effectively put paid to its chances.</p> <h2>1972 George Steiner</h2> <p>It was the most illustrious panel in the Booker\u2019s history. Both the other judges, Cyril Connolly and Elizabeth Bowen, were too ill to attend the ceremony. I fought very hard for John Berger to win for G, and then he threw it in my face by giving half the prize money to the Black Panthers. It was a very grim experience. I was in a very precarious position at the time and I literally thought it was the end for me in this country. I thought I would have to pack my bags and go. </p> <h2>1973 Edna O\u2019Brien</h2> <p>Mary McCarthy and I were the judges, with Karl Miller presiding as chairman. Disputes were negligible. From a batch of about 20, it was whittled down to two contenders - The Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell and The Black Prince by Iris Murdoch, with Farrell winning by a whisker. Next day, Mary changed her mind and it was left to Miller to cast the deciding vote, which he did with alacrity and no rancour. The prize has changed as the literary/publishing world has undergone a radical and not always edifying sea change: the celebrity virus now infects authors and judges alike.</p> <h2>1974 Ion Trewin</h2> <p>We were three judges - AS Byatt, Elizabeth Jane Howard and me. At the shortlist meeting, Jane remarked that she thought Ending Up by Kingsley Amis (then her husband) was his best book and should go on the shortlist. I looked first at Antonia, and then at Martyn Goff, the prize\u2019s administrator - both remained impassive. We broke for a breather. Martyn said that as chairman it was up to me. Antonia liked the novel (as did I). On literary grounds neither of us had problems about shortlisting it, but what would the press say? </p> <p>The Booker was already familiar with controversies. Martyn, I know, was not averse to the publicity that our decision would inevitably bring. (This was to centre around a vituperative correspondence in the Times.) But would the burgeoning reputation of the prize be damaged? He thought not. More important was our choice of winner. Antonia and I spoke up for Nadine Gordimer\u2019s The Conservationist, but Jane was less impressed. She remained keen on Ending Up, but realising that neither Antonia nor I would countenance it winning, she concentrated on Stanley Middleton\u2019s Holiday, a study of middle England that she saw as a \u201cperfect miniature\u201d.</p> <p>With only three judges, it seemed important to me that we did not compromise or produce a two-one verdict. Might we split the prize between Middleton and Gordimer? Martyn said he knew of no reason why not. We were vindicated by The Conservationist being selected this year for the Best of the Booker shortlist.</p> <p>My favourite Booker winner remains Schindler\u2019s Ark (1982) by Thomas Keneally (but I must declare my interest and say that I was its editor).</p> <h2>1975 Susan Hill</h2> <p>Peter Ackroyd was the young, newly appointed literary editor of the Spectator. Roy Fuller was a distinguished older poet. Angus Wilson was in his years as founder of the creative writing course at UEA and one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary novel. It was a daunting experience to join them as a judge. I took the mountain of submitted novels on my honeymoon, and our first meeting was scheduled for the day I returned. I discovered that Angus had spent a holiday at the same Italian hotel a few weeks earlier. So we should all have been in mellow mood, and three of us were. But Roy Fuller was not the easiest man to work with. He was acerbic and disliked being contradicted, and when it came to choosing a shortlist he refused to join in, on the grounds that we had agreed on our winner, so a shortlist was superfluous. The Booker management committee was, rightly, having none of this and insisted. </p> <p>I had been shortlisted myself three years earlier, and it had given my career a huge boost. I fought hard. We all did. Fuller grudgingly agreed to allowing a shortlist of two - the winner and one runner-up. Otherwise, he was going to walk. It was tricky and it spoiled what should have been an enjoyable experience. I was very happy with our winner, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u2019s Heat and Dust, but I wish we had stood up to Fuller and if he had walked out, so be it. </p> <p>My personal Best of Bookers is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The omission of Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower even from the shortlist in 1995 I find quite inexplicable. </p> <h2>1976 Francis King</h2> <p>There is a vast difference of scale between the prize as I experienced it as a judge and how it is now. Then the prize money was far less generous, and the fee for the judging was an honorarium. There were only three judges: our chairman Walter Allen, an admirable novelist and critic, then confined to a wheelchair, so that I had to read out his presentation speech for him; Mary Wilson, the wife of the prime minister; and me. Despite his failing health, Allen was, unlike me, immensely conscientious in reading every submission from cover to cover. Mary Wilson, a lover of poetry and herself an artless but often touching poet, was at the disadvantage of having read few novels in the course of her life - so that she was clearly puzzled when I referred to one of the submissions as \u201cKafkaesque\u201d. </p> <p>My sister Elizabeth looked through the piles of books awaiting my reading, and eventually held up David Storey\u2019s Saville. With a colleague, John Guest, she had already put in a lot of robust work as one of its two editors. \u201cThis will be the winner,\u201d she announced. It was, she explained, an epic about a north country mining community and was therefore exactly what would appeal to Allen, a lifetime socialist, and to the wife of a Labour PM. She was right. I battled for Julian Rathbone\u2019s King Fisher Lives, to no avail. Mary Wilson was obdurate: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be party to giving the prize to a book about cannibalism.\u201d </p> <p>For me far and away the best Booker winner in the whole history of the Prize is JG Farrell\u2019s The Siege of Krishnapur. The best of all the novels that ought to have won the Prize but failed to do so is Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s masterpiece The Blue Flower</p> <h2>1977 Beryl Bainbridge</h2> <p>Making a choice was very difficult - because it was this great prize of the world, one had to be very careful. Since I was published by Duckworth, it was very peculiar to have a Duckworth novel - Great Granny Webster by Caroline Blackwood - included in the vote. I put my vote forward - for Blackwood - but the discussion on it lasted only about three minutes, because it was such a short book. So nobody was really interested in that. All I can remember of the final meeting is that I got terribly tired, I literally sank lower and lower under the table. Brendan Gill, who I thought was American, went towards the balcony saying he was going to throw himself off, he was so fed up. Philip Larkin was completely silent most of the time. Nobody dared say a word to him and he never said a word back. The only one who was in total control of everything was Robin Ray. He was so clever that we all went along with whatever he said, and he wanted Staying On by Paul Scott to win. Poor Scott was too ill to collect the prize.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been shortlisted for the Booker five times and never won. I\u2019m just very pleased to have been noticed.</p> <h2>1978 Derwent May</h2> <p>In 1978, all the five jury members had a different first choice, and they were all sticking to it. Suddenly someone suggested a compromise candidate that we all quite liked, but it seemed to me that we were now heading for disaster. Freddie Ayer, the chairman, had more or less pulled out, saying that the only novels he enjoyed reading were crime novels. So I went round the jury - the other three were all novelists, PH Newby, Angela Huth and Clare Boylan - and said to them in turn \u201cIs this book your first choice?\u201d All, rather sheepishly, said \u201cNo\u201d. I said, \u201cThe winner must surely be at least one person\u2019s first choice\u201d, and I saw it was the moment for me to push what I thought was unmistakably the best book, Iris Murdoch\u2019s The Sea, The Sea - which I knew was at least one juror\u2019s second choice (the other shortlisted authors were Kingsley Amis, Andr\u00e9 Brink, Penelope Fitzgerald, Jane Gardam and Bernice Rubens). I\u2019m glad to say it won. </p> <p>The best three winners have, I think, been the Murdoch, William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage and Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. The prize has always lurched too much in favour of writers with unpromising backgrounds or good liberal attitudes, but it has unfailingly provided an excellent focus on the year\u2019s new novels.</p> <h2>1979 Hilary Spurling </h2> <p>I loved my Booker summer, which boils down in my memory to long, hot, hazy days spent lying under a tree in the garden reading novels and saying to anyone who tried to interrupt: \u201cGo away, I\u2019m working.\u201d It was a strong field and the bookies\u2019 favourite was VS Naipaul\u2019s A Bend in the River. Its opponents on the panel argued that the book shouldn\u2019t strictly be classified as a novel, and in any case he\u2019d won the prize before. The Naipaul lobby (including me) snapped back that the novel was doomed if it couldn\u2019t expand to include this sort of documentary fiction, and that our job was to pick the year\u2019s best book, regardless of its author.</p> <p>The final verdict was as much of a shock to the judges as it was to everybody else. We\u2019d spent the entire afternoon at loggerheads, and in the end compromised by giving the prize to everybody\u2019s second choice, Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s small, slight, melancholy but beautifully judged and executed Offshore. Her recently published collected letters make it clear that her triumph - and the general incredulity that greeted it - caused her humiliation ever after.</p> <h2>1980 Claire Tomalin</h2> <p>I was determined that Alice Munro should be on the shortlist, and stuck my heels in to get her there. There were two real contenders for the prize, I believed, Anthony Burgess\u2019s Earthly Powers and William Golding\u2019s Rites of Passage, and the night before the final judging session I lay awake debating with myself: the Golding beautifully written and constructed, but with a slightly musty feel about it; Burgess a magnificent entertainer, overflowing with good humour, sometimes tipping into the slapdash. Both books thoroughly deserving. The next morning David Daiches, our chairman, began: \u201cWe\u2019ll go through the list in alphabetical order. I take it no one consider Burgess a possible winner?\u201d Silence from the others. I exploded into a eulogy of Burgess\u2019s energy, invention and comic gift. I saw I had convinced no one, and felt that left only Golding. And so it was. Burgess sent a message saying he would not come to the dinner unless he won. I don\u2019t blame him. I saw a tear trickle down Golding\u2019s cheek when the announcement was made. I have re-read neither book, and I have rejoiced to see Alice Munro win the recognition she deserves. </p> <h2>1981 Hermione Lee</h2> <p>Salman Rushdie has won the Booker of Bookers and the Best of all Bookers, with his lastingly dazzling, deep and splendid novel, now a classic of world literature, Midnight\u2019s Children. But over a quarter of a century ago, when I was one of the judges who gave him the prize, his book was by no means an easy winner. Not many people had heard of Rushdie, unless they\u2019d read a weird piece of science fiction called Grimus or seen the stunning extracts from the new novel in Granta. Our panel of judges (Samuel Hynes, Joan Bakewell, Brian Aldiss and me, with Malcolm Bradbury as chair) were pulling in different ways. We were reading many writers with more established reputations, and much more experience, than Rushdie - such as Muriel Spark. (To my lasting regret, we overlooked one of Nadine Gordimer\u2019s best novels, July\u2019s People.) Brian Aldiss was especially keen on Doris Lessing\u2019s \u201cspace fiction\u201d The Sirian Experiments, Malcolm on Ian McEwan\u2019s The Comfort of Strangers. </p> <p>We all jumped at the late arrival of the almost forgotten Anglo-Irish writer Molly Keane, the short-listing of whose wicked and eccentric novel Good Behaviour gained her a devoted new following. But our final discussion was painfully split between Midnight\u2019s Children and The White Hotel, DM Thomas\u2019s psychoanalytical erotic novel, centring on the massacre at Babi Yar, which made a strong impression on me at the time but now, looking back, seems to me sensationalist and exploitative. Sam Hynes, Joan Bakewell and I were firmly on the side of Rushdie; Brian Aldiss was passionately keen on Thomas, and so was Malcolm Bradbury, who tried at the very end of the discussion to argue that the chair should have a casting, and over-ruling vote. This was not allowed, Rushdie won by 3 votes to 2, and Brian Aldiss (whose intensity impressed me) left the room with tears in his eyes. When the 1981 prize was announced, a mighty career was launched. It would have taken off anyway, but it was helped by the prize. Chairing the prize 25 years on, I felt happy to be helping on Kiran Desai, a literary descendant of Rushdie\u2019s.</p> <h2>1982 Paul Bailey</h2> <p>There are many things I regret doing, and being a judge for the Booker prize is one of them. For some years after I was associated with two novels I absolutely loathed and would not have even started reading in other circumstances (on the shortlist that year were Thomas Keneally\u2019s Schindler\u2019s Ark, John Arden\u2019s Silence Among the Weapons, William Boyd\u2019s An Ice-Cream War, Lawrence Durrell\u2019s Constance or Solitary Practices, Alice Thomas Ellis\u2019s The 27th Kingdom and Timothy Mo\u2019s Sour Sweet). They are history now and are likely to remain so. My one good deed was to ensure a place on the shortlist for Sour Sweet, consequently bringing his work to a larger audience. But otherwise it was a dispiriting experience. The winner, by a single vote, was Schindler\u2019s Ark, a controversial but ultimately very popular choice.</p> <p>The prize was founded, in part, to encourage competitiveness. Which of the six novelists will make it to the finishing post? This grisly notion constitutes a perfect recipe for envy, back-biting and self-glorification. The Booker has certainly mirrored fashion - the collapse of the empire; post-modernist Victorian pastiche; New Age sentimentality. Several stinkers have been honoured, but there have been some glorious losers: Alice Munro\u2019s The Beggar Maid, John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. A wonderful book such as Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Blue Flower was completely ignored, and I hope the judges for 1995 are blushing now to be reminded of their grotesque oversight.</p> <h2>1983 Fay Weldon</h2> <p>A lively year, as Booker prizes go. We had a distinguished set of judges and some terrific books. The panel was finally split between a Coetzee and a Rushdie - a clash of continents. As the chairperson I had the casting vote - which is not saying \u201coh, I like that one best\u201d, but weighing up the arguments of one set of judges against the others and deciding which are the most convincing. The Coetzee (Life &amp; Times of Michael K) got it, and Rushdie was really annoyed. </p> <p>As a fervent feminist (25 years back), and taking time to make up my mind, I made a joke: \u201cI haven\u2019t got my husband here to help me decide.\u201d But one should never make jokes in the presence of the police, security or at a Booker prize judging, and word got round that I meant it. Then I had to deliver the customary chairperson\u2019s speech. After I sat down, the then president of the Publishers Association got to his feet, crossed the room and hit my agent Giles Gordon, second best thing to hitting me. I\u2019d used the speech to reproach the publishers for giving such rotten deals to writers. Since the BBC was working to rule, they cut the cameras at 10pm precisely: I was using transparent screens from which to make the speech (a Thatcher trick), and they went blank before I had time to finish with the usual pacifying bit about how you are all honourable men and none of what I say applies to you. Instead, I just had to sit down and all hell broke loose. </p> <p>I had actually shown the speech to the organisers earlier, but I suppose they hadn\u2019t bothered to read it. I hadn\u2019t thought it was all that inflammatory. Michael Caine, charismatic chairman of Bookers, came up to me years later, when I had been inadvertently invited to one of the subsequent dinners, and said: \u201cIt is not by any wish of mine you are here tonight.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all got rather dull since: the prize tends to go to well-behaved and deserving writers: no subversion allowed. No one hits anyone. </p> <h2>1984 John Fuller</h2> <p>This was the year when the hot favourite, JG Ballard (Empire of the Sun), was passed over for a relative newcomer, Anita Brookner (Hotel du Lac). Hardly a scandal, but in a strong year we had already discarded some big names (Burgess, Golding, Spark, Bainbridge, two Amises, etc) before reaching the shortlist, so that journalistic antennae were twitching, and the outcome was felt to be a further surprise. The judges got on pretty well together. We were somewhat exercised by the question of whether Julian Barnes\u2019s Flaubert\u2019s Parrot was really a novel, while in the final judging session Anthony Curtis continued to argue for David Lodge (Small World), and Ted Rowlands stuck out for the Ballard. I thought that the Brookner was, in its economy and elegance, a small triumph of moral insight worthy of the tradition of James and Forster to which it belonged. I was relieved to have support from Polly Devlin and the somewhat eccentric Richard Cobb in this, and pleased at the nudge to her career that the prize must have given. </p> <h2>1985 Marina Warner</h2> <p>Norman St John Stevas was our chair, and early on that summer he picked out a number of books which he recommended his panel to read. Among them was a surprise, a bulky novel called The Bone People by Keri Hulme. Alongside the many gleamingly designed offerings from the major publishing houses, it had the distinction of being published by a women\u2019s cooperative in New Zealand, who, when the book won the prize against very high odds, came up in full island dress to collect it, chanting a Maori praise song. </p> <p>Feelings in the final meeting - and afterwards - ran very high about this novel, but St John Stevas unexpectedly championed it throughout. Nina Bawden opposed it very strongly on the grounds of its violence (the novel tells a terrifying story of child-beatings), and wrote later publicly to distance herself from the decision. Nina found herself significantly outnumbered in her opposition, because Joanna Lumley didn\u2019t attend the final judging. She sent a message to say she was in rehearsal and that her nominated winner was Doris Lessing, for The Good Terrorist. When she heard The Bone People had won, she too dissociated herself from the judgment. JW Lambert and I supported the book. </p> <p>I think that the best argument for the whole cruel and unfair business of prizes is that they can lead readers to writers who wouldn\u2019t otherwise be read much or perhaps at all. I didn\u2019t think Lessing needed the prize (and she would agree) and certainly not for a novel that is not her best (though it\u2019s a feature of prizes that authors often win for their weakest works). </p> <h2>1986 Anthony Thwaite</h2> <p>My chairing of the 1986 judges was marred, or enlivened, by several scandals or leaks or items of gossip. I was said (wrongly) to have lectured my fellow judges on \u201chow to read a novel\u201d. I unwisely wrote to Julian Barnes to commiserate with him about his non-appearance on the shortlist: I was quoted as blaming it on \u201call those women\u201d (my four fellow judges were Edna Healey, Isabel Quigly, Gillian Reynolds and Bernice Rubens).</p> <p>It was a splendid shortlist: Kingsley Amis, Margaret Atwood, Paul Bailey, Robertson Davies, Kazuo Ishiguro, Timothy Mo. We were still going to and fro up until 10 minutes before the press announcement had to be made: two strongly for Amis, two equally strongly for Davies (What\u2019s Bred in the Bone), and a wobbler in the middle. At the last moment the wobbler came down on the side of The Old Devils, and Amis had won. A very satisfactory result, I thought.</p> <h2>1987 PD James</h2> <p>I look back on my chairmanship in 1987 as a very happy experience, particularly as I had as my colleagues four hardworking, enthusiastic and knowledgeable judges: Lady Selina Hastings, Allan Massie, Trevor McDonald and John B Thompson. I did have a fear at the time - and still do - that to ask the panel to read more than 100 novels in a comparatively short time can result in a literary surfeit which makes the final judgment more difficult. Choosing the winner was a long process, and I remember scurrying to the dinner table a little after the meal had started. At the end, however, the vote was unanimous - Penelope Lively won, for Moon Tiger - which is what I had hoped for. The Booker may at times have tended to increase the unhelpful dichotomy between popular storytelling and books which are classified as literary novels, but most of the winners have combined high literary achievement with compelling storytelling. </p> <h2>1988 Blake Morrison</h2> <p>We were a jury of writers that year: Sebastian Faulks, Rose Tremain, Philip French and, in the chair, Michael Foot, who seemed keener to talk about Byron than to reminisce about leading the Labour party. As early as our first meeting, Peter Carey\u2019s Oscar and Lucinda was the clear frontrunner. The only arguments were about which novels should be with him on the shortlist. I read the bulk of the 100 or so entries during a fortnight\u2019s holiday with two small children in Wales, rising early and retiring late. Those we finally settled on were Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses (which I read with innocent pleasure - the controversy over it didn\u2019t erupt till the following year), Bruce Chatwin\u2019s Utz (his last novel - his funeral was the day of the fatwa), David Lodge\u2019s Nice Work (one of his best), Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Beginning of Spring (one of her best) and Marina Warner\u2019s The Lost Father. </p> <p>My biggest regret was failing to get Doris Lessing\u2019s The Fifth Child on the shortlist - though in retrospect Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s first novel, The Swimming-Pool Library, was a graver omission. The final meeting lasted 25 minutes: Foot was for Rushdie, the rest of us were for Carey, so that was that. Rushdie has sometimes been caricatured as a bad loser, but at the ceremony he behaved impeccably and was generous in his praise of the winning book. All in all, a pleasing outcome. My other experiences of sitting on prize juries have been grisly in comparison.</p> <h2>1989 David Lodge</h2> <p>Our shortlist meeting was the longest to date, and much of it was taken up with discussion of Martin Amis\u2019s London Fields. It is public knowledge that two of the judges on the panel, Maggie Gee and Helen McNeil, successfully resisted its inclusion on the shortlist, an outcome I still regret. The final judging session was uncontroversial - all but one of us were unequivocally in favour of Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day. I consider it one of the best Booker winners I have read. </p> <p>The success of the prize has had an enormous impact on the reception of literary fiction and other kinds of writing, not only directly, but also indirectly through the proliferation of new prizes that have imitated it. But the overtly competitive nature of these prizes, heightened by the publication of longlists and shortlists, takes its psychological toll on writers; and, given the large element of chance in the composition and operation of judging panels, the importance now attached to prizes in our literary culture seems excessive. A committee is a blunt instrument of literary criticism.</p> <h2>1990 Hilary Mantel </h2> <p>Not a discourteous word was exchanged between the hardworking 1990 judges - much to the disappointment of the administrator Martyn Goff, who praised us to our faces and later whined that we were boring. Denis Forman ran the meetings with smooth expertise, and largely kept his own opinions dark until he cast the final vote.</p> <p>Weeks before I was appointed a judge, I\u2019d read John McGahern\u2019s Amongst Women and said, reaching page 20, \u201cThis will win the Booker\u201d. So I was disappointed, but AS Byatt\u2019s Possession was a good book and a popular choice, and the discussion was fair. The process exhausted me, and I declined to do it a second time. What I despised was the leaking by the publicity machine of trivial non-stories to the press - I felt the prize had enough status and news value without that. I also believe the judges shouldn\u2019t review the books under consideration or talk about them in public, and in 1990 we didn\u2019t.</p> <p>I\u2019m glad I was a Booker judge relatively early in my career. It stopped me thinking that literary prizes are about literary value. Even the most correct jury goes in for horsetrading and gamesmanship, and what emerges is a compromise. </p> <p>For me the best of the Bookers is The Siege of Krishnapur. I read it again a few months ago and its supple humour, its insight, economy and narrative drive make it an enduring delight.</p> <h2>1991 Nicholas Mosley</h2> <p>I was asked to be a judge probably because I had just won the Whitbread the previous year. This had itself been a surprise, because it seemed I was out of favour with the literary establishment, having been labelled a \u201cnovelist of ideas\u201d while what was in favour was \u201cstyle\u201d. And style seemed most easily to be exhibited in stories that were outlandish, or grim, or quaint. I looked forward to judging the Booker because I thought I might give a boost to \u201cideas\u201d. There were five judges, and we had to choose six books out of 100 for the shortlist. I thought - well, surely, with this set-up I\u2019ll be able to squeeze in one choice of mine. But, in the event, I got none of my choices on to the list, because of the inflexibility of the voting system and of the other four judges, who were devotees of \u201cstyle\u201d. So I resigned, partly in a huff, but also because I thought that by so doing I might still be able to strike a blow for \u201cideas\u201d, as I might be asked to explain myself in the press - which I did.</p> <p>The winner chosen by the remaining judges was Ben Okri\u2019s The Famished Road - a beautifully written (yes) story of a boy in a west African village who goes to and fro between his family and the local witchdoctor. My choice would have been Allan Massie\u2019s The Sins of the Father, which confronted the issue of what was possible or impossible if the child of a notorious ex-Nazi and the child of a Jewish victim fell in love after the second world war. What could be forgiven, and by whom, and what could not. But these are controversial questions, and thus conventionally to be avoided.</p> <h2>1992 Victoria Glendinning</h2> <p>My fellow judges were John Coldstream, literary editor of the Telegraph, Harriet Harvey-Wood, literary director of the British Council, Valentine Cunningham and Mark Lawson. We became intimate in the way of people thrown together in a scary but non-fatal railway accident. John dreamt one night that he was Spartacus, with the Roman legions advancing on him in the form of piles of new titles. It was a vintage year for rent-a-sneer in the media. Prominent journalists whinged chauvinistically about \u201cfar-flung authors\u201d, deaf to the explosion of energy from Commonwealth novelists, which has been the most significant feature of the Booker\u2019s 40 years. The prize was \u201cessentially trivial\u201d, pontificated AN Wilson in contemptuous mode in the Evening Standard; and, enraged, I wrote to the Guardian letters page to contest Richard Gott\u2019s clich\u00e9s about the decline of the novel and what he called the \u201ctokenism\u201d of the inclusion of Mich\u00e8le Roberts on the shortlist.</p> <p>Every book on our shortlist had one passionate supporter and one furious antagonist. When at the final meeting we locked horns over the frontrunners, it was suggested that we should reach our decision by taking into account second choices - proportional representation. This procedure gave Michael Ondaatje (The English Patient) and Barry Unsworth (Sacred Hunger) equal points. I turned to Martyn Goff, sitting behind me discreetly - or as discreetly as anyone can who is wearing a gold satin tie - and asked if we could share the prize between the two. He conceded there was no rule against it. So that\u2019s what we did.</p> <p>Before the meeting, I was so unnerved that I left my bag with all my notes in it at the bank. When stressed I become sharp-tongued, and at one point told a fellow judge that he was a condescending bastard. My notes on our sessions are, at this distance in time, enigmatic. What in the world, for example, was Val Cunningham on about when he said: \u201cI am very interested in Huntley &amp; Palmer\u2019s biscuits and their role in literature\u201d? </p> <h2>1993 Gillian Beer</h2> <p>Olivier Todd, the French novelist, shrugged his shoulders at our second judges\u2019 meeting: no lunches with publishers, no approaches from agents, he complained - what an odd English bubble of propriety we were gathered inside. He was joking, but only just. And it is one of the remarkable things about being a Booker judge that no one tempts you with hospitality. You simply sit and read, and talk, and read again, over several months. The pleasure is in the reading, and in the talk. One of the rewards of going to see a new film is the conversation straight after, but reading new novels can be a lonely business. Not in this case. In 1993 I remember impassioned defences of books one of us had grown attached to, but no quarrels, just engrossing talk. Our chair, Grey Gowrie, came up with an ingenious criterion: novels must have \u201cradioactivity\u201d to stay in the running. He meant we must remember them weeks, months later. They mustn\u2019t fade. A self-proving criterion perhaps, but reassuring.</p> <p>One novel that certainly had that quality and yet just missed the shortlist was Trainspotting and it was in arguing about Irvine Welsh\u2019s book that we came nearest to quarrelling. Getting from long to shortlist was painful, worse than sorting out the winner among that final six. Some wanted the prize to go to David Malouf\u2019s Remembering Babylon, while Caryl Phillips\u2019s Crossing the River and Carol Shields\u2019s The Stone Diaries had strong support as well. But Roddy Doyle\u2019s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha won the day with its extraordinary technical achievement and its emotional force, taking us inside the voice and experience of a 10-year-old boy in the midst of family break-up.</p> <h2>1994 James Wood</h2> <p>After serving on the 1994 Booker prize committee, I made a pledge never to judge a big fiction prize again, and I have so far honoured it. We were a congenial group, and our chairman was not a former politician or bureaucrat but a distinguished literary critic (John Bayley); our meetings were friendly, and surely no less or more argumentative than those of other years. But the absurdity of the process was soon apparent: it is almost impossible to persuade someone else of the quality or poverty of a selected novel (a useful lesson in the limits of literary criticism). In practice, judge A blathers on about his favourite novel for five minutes, and then judge B blathers on about her favourite novel for five minutes, and nothing changes: no one switches sides. That is when the horse-trading begins. I remember that one of the judges phoned me and said, in effect: \u201cI know that you especially like novel X, and you know that I especially like novel Y. It would be good if both those books got on to the shortlist, yes? So if you vote for my novel, I\u2019ll vote for yours, OK?\u201d</p> <p>That is how our shortlist was patched together, and it is how our winner was chosen. It is how every shortlist is chosen, whether the premises are as explicit or not. I liked the winning book a great deal (James Kelman\u2019s How Late It Was, How Late) - it was one of my choices - and would have been happy with either that book or Alan Hollinghurst\u2019s The Folding Star. But I intensely disliked the way we reached that verdict, and felt that the arbitrary, utterly political process discredited the whole project.</p> <p>Since then, prizes have become a form of reviewing: it is prize-lists that select what people read, prize-lists that make literary careers. Bookshops order novels based on the prizes they have won or been shortlisted for. Nowadays, a whole month before the shortlist is announced, scores of novelists are effectively told that their books have not been the \u201cbig books\u201d of the year, because they are not to be found on the longlist. Soon, no doubt, we will have the long-longlist, and the long-long longlist. Some wonderful books win the Booker, of course, just as the flypaper occasionally catches some really large flies. But it means - or should mean - nothing in literary terms.</p> <h2>1995 Ruth Rendell</h2> <p>I was always being asked what it was like to be on the Booker \u201cjury\u201d. But I could never see us as that. Jurors have to decide between guilt and innocence while we had to pick the best. The best of 140 in our case - or 6.3 books a week. Reading that number is normal for me, but books I want to read, not ones I have to. It makes a big difference. We got on well, we judges. We disagreed but never quite quarrelled. I used to lie and say I read every word of every book. The truth is that I did my best, but I am a judicious skipper. Going home to Suffolk, I finished a novel and left it in the train. A man called out to me that I\u2019d forgotten it, but when I said to keep it he was delighted. I hope he liked it better than I did. </p> <p>So what did I get out of being a judge? The pleasure of giving the prize to Pat Barker\u2019s The Ghost Road, my choice, not one I was persuaded into. A mild antipathy to new novels so that now I tend to read more non-fiction. And my friendship with Peter Kemp, a fellow judge, which began in those Booker days. </p> <h2>1996 Jonathan Coe</h2> <p>How very arbitrary it seems, in retrospect. There was nothing wrong with our shortlist, and nothing wrong with our winner (Last Orders, by Graham Swift), but at 12 years\u2019 distance, it feels as though we could easily have chosen another six novels altogether. Our discussions were lengthy - and amicable, for the most part (until the final session, when tempers started to fray) - but what strikes me now about the whole process was how entirely subjective it was. Anyone who sets great store by the choices of Booker prize panels should remember this: the process consists of nothing more rigorous than five people sitting in a room together for a few hours, swapping personal opinions. And as far as I remember, not a single judge (including me) ever changed his or her mind, or shifted his or her position, in response to an argument put forward by a colleague. In the midst of it all, the novel which I now remember as being the finest of all - Asylum, by Patrick McGrath - slipped through our net, and failed to make the shortlist by a whisker. If it had reached the shortlist, such is the randomness of the final selection process, it might easily have won the prize itself.</p> <h2>1997 Jason Cowley</h2> <p>Before the longlist was made public, if you wanted to know which books were in contention you would usually be able to find out by having a discreet lunch with Martyn Goff, the charming and mischievous prize administrator who used to operate his own idiosyncratic system of leaks, withholding and revealing in equal measure. I remember turning up to the meeting at which our shortlist would be decided to be received with suspicion by our chairman, Gillian Beer. She wanted to know how our longlist was being discussed in the papers, and I was pretty sure by the way she looked at me that she thought I was responsible. Certainly I\u2019d been having fun writing polemical pieces about the state of the British novel. </p> <p>I believed then as I do now that the Booker is essentially a jamboree, little more than a kind of sport, with its own roster of winners and losers. It shouldn\u2019t be dignified or taken too seriously. But I wasn\u2019t the leaker. As we sat down for the lunch that preceded our discussions, and with Gillian Beer still grumbling about the longlist leaking out, I heard Goff say: \u201cIt\u2019s quite extraordinary. I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d He then, winningly, glanced at me and winked. </p> <p>I often think that I\u2019ve never quite recovered from my experience of being a judge. I began the year as an enthusiastic and engaged reader and reviewer of contemporary fiction, and ended it much more interested in non-fiction and narrative journalism. And of all the novels I read that year there are perhaps only two that I could ever imagine rereading: Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things (our unfairly maligned winner) and Ian McEwan\u2019s Enduring Love (which just missed out on being shortlisted and divided the judges more than any other entry). </p> <h2>1998 Douglas Hurd</h2> <p>This was a quiet year. There were no sensational or overpowering entries, and no passionate disputes among the judges. The crafty device of holding the final meeting of the judges immediately before the award dinner certainly concentrated the mind. The prize went to Amsterdam by Ian McEwan, not because we thought it was about time he won the Booker, but because in a mild year most people (though not the chairman) thought his offering finished just ahead of Beryl Bainbridge, riding Master Georgie</p> <h2>1999 Shena Mackay</h2> <p>It was a very strong year for fiction. When I was a judge - alongside Boyd Tonkin, Natasha Walter and John Sutherland, with Gerald Kaufman in the chair - several books assumed to be shoo-ins weren\u2019t on the shortlist, which caused dismay, as did the discovery by some authors that their books had not been entered, on the presumption that the judges would call them in. We failed to do so. Sorry. Pressures of time and books arriving late.</p> <p>Our shortlisted authors were JM Coetzee, Anita Desai, Michael Frayn, Andrew O\u2019Hagan, Ahdaf Soueif and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. We gave the prize - controversially because he had won in 1983 - to Coetzee for Disgrace. We were vindicated recently when it was shortlisted for the Best of Bookers. John Sutherland was a strong advocate of Salman Rushdie (The Ground Beneath Her Feet) in our year, and he must be delighted that Midnight\u2019s Children has won the Booker of Bookers for the second time.</p> <p>Our chief dispute arose from John\u2019s gadfly comments in this newspaper. As far as I remember, it was the suggestion that Natasha Walter and I had a feminist agenda which prompted Natasha to write a letter to the Guardian, which I signed. Being a judge gave me much more anxiety than being on the shortlist myself, even with the horrible bookies\u2019 odds and the risk of being depicted as a cartoon racehorse, because as a judge you are responsible for disappointing a lot of people.</p> <h2>2000 Rose Tremain</h2> <p>My second stint as a Booker prize judge contrasted with the first in one important respect: we had an extremely effective and powerful chair in Simon Jenkins. In 1988, the lovable Michael Foot had been hampered, as chair, by diary overspill. But Simon\u2019s influence on the 2000 jury was impressive. Meetings were held at his rooms in Albany, rather than at Martyn Goff\u2019s preferred venue of the Savile Club. Despite the constant lamentations of his fax machine, Simon\u2019s attention never strayed from the tasks in hand, the first of which was to kick out the dross. Roy Foster, Caroline Gascoigne, Mariella Frostrup and I were a vocal team and we each had our favourites. Mariella was able to squeeze Matthew Kneale\u2019s English Passengers on to the list, and Caroline\u2019s advocacy for Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s When We Were Orphans was duly recognised. Roy Foster and I lost our battle for Anne Enright\u2019s What Are You Like?, but my call-in title, Trezza Azzopardi\u2019s The Hiding Place, scraped home. </p> <p>What is really interesting is that nobody thought Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Blind Assassin was her best book. Where Simon\u2019s mental agility paid off was in persuading us all (except Mariella) that Atwood deserved the prize anyway - for all the times she\u2019d nearly won it and had been pipped at the post by a lesser writer. </p> <h2>2001 Philip Hensher</h2> <p>It\u2019s an unusual experience, reading for the Booker. For once in your life you take a synchronic slice through the English-language novel, and see exactly what\u2019s interesting it at that moment. I was lucky in having an excellent chairman in Kenneth Baker, unprejudiced, interested and diligent, and fellow judges who really knew about the novel - Kate Summerscale was particularly good to argue with. I think we made a good choice with Peter Carey\u2019s substantial True History of the Kelly Gang, but the whole shortlist was, in my view, exceptional. I regretted that media excitement over Beryl Bainbridge actually damaged her chances with According to Queeney. We realised that if we shortlisted her, she had to win. There was no point in blotting out the winner\u2019s publicity with a storm of \u201cBeryl Bridesmaid Again\u201d headlines. I wanted to do more for Nick Hornby\u2019s How to Be Good, and it was a relief that the Whitbread rewarded Philip Pullman\u2019s The Amber Spyglass, which we could easily have shortlisted. It was a good-humoured, interesting experience, but what I got most out of it was being introduced to new novelists - Zvi Jagendorf, Ciaran Carson, Jamie O\u2019Neill - however far they got in the judging process. </p> <p>The best novel to have been given the prize is, I think, Naipaul\u2019s In a Free State in 1971. </p> <h2>2002 Salley Vickers</h2> <p>I was a judge the year Life of Pi won, and there is no doubt that our choice was a rip-roaring popular success. The booksellers loved us for it. It was me, in fact, who first drew the other judges\u2019 attention to the novel. I was given it while on tour in Canada, by a Winnipeg bookseller, and read it excitedly on the plane home. We used to have extra meetings at the home of our chair, Lisa Jardine, and I recall telling all the other judges - Erica Wagner, Russell Celyn Jones and David Baddiel - about the book, which at that time had not been entered by Canongate. I was very glad to see it on to the shortlist, but it was not my final choice (the other books on the shortlist were Rohinton Mistry\u2019s Family Matters, Carol Shields\u2019s Unless, William Trevor\u2019s The Story of Lucy Gault, Sarah Waters\u2019s Fingersmith and Tim Winton\u2019s Dirt Music). However, Lisa was a skilled chair. She wanted a unanimous verdict and, much as I admired the book, I couldn\u2019t give her that. So she said, \u201cSalley, it was you who brought the book to our attention. Will you give the decision your blessing?\u201d Well, I couldn\u2019t refuse.</p> <h2>2003 DJ Taylor</h2> <p>I can\u2019t say that I enjoyed reading all the books - 113 of them, I believe, in that year - but there was a certain amount of pleasure to be gained from the attendant razzmatazz, the thought that for a very brief period in the year an artefact routinely overlooked by large swathes of an indifferent media was suddenly news. There were several memorable clashes of opinion, the funniest by far coming when the chair, John Carey, trying desperately to persuade us of the merits of Martin Amis\u2019s Yellow Dog, read aloud from a paragraph describing the death-throes of a dying fly, at which point Francine Stock and I caught each other\u2019s eye across the table and began to giggle. The judging process was pretty much a waste of time as all four of the other judges arrived at the longlist meeting convinced that DBC Pierre\u2019s Vernon God Little was one of the great masterpieces of the early 21st century, whereas I thought that it was a promising first novel. This meant that the final judging session lasted a bare 10 minutes, after which I had to sit discussing the existence (or non-existence) of God with AC Grayling, a subject on which both of us hold strong views.</p> <h2>2004 Tibor Fischer</h2> <p>I\u2019d heard the rumours. The hair-pulling, the eye-gouging, the shameful flouncing. I was, however, extremely impressed by the rigour of my fellow judges, who, unlike me, had proper jobs and families to distract them from the mound of books. What did I learn? Discussion is futile. No one changes their mind about a book. You might as well have a show of hands straight away. There aren\u2019t many bad books (only one novel ended up in the bin after two pages), but there are a lot of so-so, nondescript novels that leave no trace. Publishers are idiots. I was very pleased Alan Hollinghurst won. But I wouldn\u2019t say The Line of Beauty is a better novel than David Mitchell\u2019s very different Cloud Atlas (which came in second) or Neil Cross\u2019s Always the Sun (or others on the longlist).</p> <p>There are good reasons why Midnight\u2019s Children has been chosen as the Best of the Bookers (although every novelist I know rates Shame as Rushdie\u2019s best book), but it would have been a more interesting exercise to have chosen the best of the shortlisted novels. It\u2019s a pity that Beryl Bainbridge has always been pipped, and my favourite novel in the Booker annals (I\u2019ve read it at least a dozen times) is Derek Robinson\u2019s Goshawk Squadron</p> <h2>2005 John Sutherland</h2> <p>When I chaired year 37, it more or less, as airline pilots say, flew by wire. The year was, by general agreement, a bumper one for fiction. As usual, no minds were much changed by the panel discussions - candidate B merely came forward when one judge\u2019s candidate A was voted down. John Banville came out top with The Sea. King of the As and Bs. Teeth were gnashed in the press the next day; but they would be if Jesus Christ had written the winning novel. I spoke to Kazuo Ishiguro (shortlisted for Never Let Me Go) shortly after. \u201cThe goalkeeper jumped the wrong way\u201d, he sportingly said. I wish I\u2019d been quick-witted enough to rejoin \u201cnot even Petr Cech has to save five penalty shots all coming at him at once\u201d. Julian Barnes, in an interview for the New York Times, was more savage (he had been shortlisted for Arthur &amp; George). Not, he felt, a bumper year for judges. Perhaps he was right. But posterity will forget us. Barnes, Ishiguro and - I believe - Banville they\u2019ll remember. And make their own judgments. </p> <h2>2006 Anthony Quinn</h2> <p>I enjoyed every moment of the 2006 Booker until the very last minutes of our final meeting in the Guildhall. That was when I realised that the novel which I had set my heart on would not be the winner. On anecdotal evidence from friends who had judged the prize in previous years, I gathered that there was usually someone on the jury who would be a complete pest and make the whole process as awkward as possible. Not this time: our chairman, Hermione Lee, set a tone of almost heartless conviviality that Candia McWilliam, Fiona Shaw and Simon Armitage consistently upheld. Indeed, we had been so likeminded in the final reckoning of our shortlist that I must have blanked the ominous build-up of support for Kiran Desai\u2019s The Inheritance of Loss and assumed that everyone would come round to what was clearly the best book, Edward St Aubyn\u2019s Mother\u2019s Milk. When I was outvoted 4-1 I was surprised, and appalled. Six months of reading and re-reading - only to be thwarted at the last! I asked for a recount, which at least got a laugh. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that I felt sick to my stomach. I was pleased for Kiran Desai, who\u2019d spent eight years writing it. But we chose the wrong book. </p> <h2>2007 Giles Foden</h2> <p>Everyone expected arguments, and we had them, but with dignity (my fellow judges were Howard Davies, Wendy Cope, Ruth Scurr and Imogen Stubbs). We never fell out. In fact, we are meeting up this autumn for a drink. Some had their favourites that others couldn\u2019t stand; others tried to hold up yardsticks against which all books might be measured. The favourite supporters made persuasive cases for AN Wilson and Nicola Barker, but only Barker got through to the shortlist, despite an unfortunate error in transmission - not the judges\u2019 fault - which suggested Wilson had. The longlist is where the real argy-bargy takes place. </p> <p>Once an author is on the shortlist anything can happen. In our case we arrived at a situation in which every judge had mutually exclusive first and last choices. Luckily, in Howard Davies we had a competent chairman, who helped us mathematically towards a choice of winner with which everyone was happy. PS: note to publishers, try not to write call-in letters with spelling mistakes, or one that make foolish claims. Some of these letters looked as if they were written in haste. Then again, so did some of the novels submitted.</p> <h2>2008 Alex Clark</h2> <p>Before I was asked to judge this year\u2019s prize, I had been on several literary prize panels and I felt I had enough experience to know roughly what I was doing. But little can prepare you for the Booker: not just the sheer volume of books submitted, but the sense that you are about to be partly responsible for making an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Now, with the final hurdle fast approaching, I can say that it\u2019s been not only an enjoyable process but also an instructive one. Reading is, of course, a solitary affair, and book reviewing not much less so. But anatomising one\u2019s taste and judgment and then communicating it to a group of people with equally strong views has been a wonderful challenge - not least because it makes for scrutiny of what it is that one values in fiction. And, gruelling though it was, I wouldn\u2019t give up those late nights and early mornings spent poring over novels.</p> <h2>2009 John Mullan</h2> <p>My fellow judges were Lucasta Miller Jim Naughtie, Sue Perkins and Michael Prodger. I do confess that I already knew, at least slightly, all the other judges. Did this make it too cosy? Maybe, but the process is enough of a challenge to make conviviality a useful blessing. It felt as if there was rather little disagreement until the end, when suddenly it was sharp. On the very day of the dinner, you get shut in a room with sandwiches and orange juice, and chip away at your short list. I would have been happy to see Sarah Waters\u2019s The Little Stranger win, and I think in another year it might have done. But it came down to Wolf Hall versus Summertime: Mantel versus Coetzee.</p> <p>Two of the other judges, Lucasta and Sue, have written elsewhere of their<br>preference for Coetzee, so the voting can hardly be a secret. What I had not expected was that my cards would be the last to go on the table. </p> <p>Being a natural loudmouth, I had been trying to speak judiciously, and had ended up seeming to be biding my moment. Coetzee is, with Roth, maybe the greatest living novelist in the English Language. He could win almost any year he publishes a novel. But Wolf Hall was something extraordinary. After the meeting, Lucasta and Sue did both say \u201cagenbite of inwit\u201d to me a few times. If you\u2019ve read the opening of Summertime, you\u2019ll understand.</p> <h2>And the winner was ...

  "<p>\"Where one burns books,\" wrote Heinrich Heine, \"one will soon burn people.\" So when the Nazis began organising public bonfires of books in 1933, everyone knew what it would lead to, right? Not exactly, says Fishburn. He begins by scanning the rich history of European book-burning, as well as the pyromania of doubting authors (poor V\u00e9ra, always having to rescue Vlad's manuscripts from the fire). Then begins the main event, an examination of book-burning in Hitler's Germany. The New York Times, for one, was rather thrilled in 1933: \"Never before have the young men had so good a right to clean up the debris of the past.\" Only by the start of the war had book-burning taken its place in the allied imagination as synecdochic of the regime's evil. And even so, Fishburn remains on the lookout for piquant ironies: \"Throughout the war, the interdiction against book burning developed alongside vigorous encouragement for [...] 'patriotic pulping',\" in which tens of millions of books in Britain alone were destroyed for their paper. The burning of books, Fishburn concludes, is not a very practical method of censorship, but it continues to this day because it is so powerful as a symbol: \"a cross between legislation and advertising\".</p>",
  "<p>Grenache, or grenache noir, is the most widely planted red grape thanks to its popularity in Spain and southern France. In the late middle ages, the house of Aragon apparently took it around the Mediterranean - although Sardinians (who call it cannonau) argue they stole it from them. This archetypal hot-climate vine has to be pruned severely if it is not to produce too much bland wine. On its own, it makes slightly light-coloured but quite alcoholic wine, which can taste spicy and sweet. The grapes have thin skins and the musts tend to oxidise easily, but can make fine ros\u00e9s. Grenache is blended with other varieties higher in colour and tannin such as syrah and mourv\u00e8dre, even in its home, Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape. </p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Grenache inspires all the fine reds and ros\u00e9s of the southern Rh\u00f4ne, and is an ingredient in many Languedoc-Roussillon AOC wines. Its <br>most distinctive products are the vins doux naturels (sweet wines) of Banyuls, Maury and Rivesaltes. </p> <p><strong>Spain</strong></p> <p>Garnacha tinta, as the locals call it, is Spain's most important red grape and is grown extensively everywhere other than Andalucia. In Rioja and Navarra, its juicy ballast is valued for the more structured tempranillo. Priorat is Spain's finest incarnation of garnacha tinta (often incorporating some of the downier garnacha peluda).</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Grenache is quantitatively very important in California and Australia, but most of the vines are planted in hot, heavily irrigated vineyards where yields are too high to make interesting wine. Dry-farmed, older vines are occasionally sought out, though, as the market clamours for Rh\u00f4ne-like wines. And in California, white zinfandel's success spawned white grenache. The variety is cultivated all round the Mediterranean.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Cruz de Piedra Garnacha 2006 Calatayud, Spain</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99, Adnams, adnams.co.uk</strong></p> <p>Just to the north-west and to the south-west respectively of Zaragoza in Aragon, Spain, Campo de Borja and Calatayud, where this is from, are sources of excellent value reds.

  "<p>So syrah and shiraz are genetically the same grape - but the wines they produce can be very different in style, depending on origin. The typical old-world syrah is lighter and leaner than the intense shiraz wines of the new world, which tend to be richer, riper and more full-bodied. In certain areas, the name you get on the bottle - syrah or shiraz - will be an indication of style rather than where it is from. </p> <p>Whatever you call it, some estimates put this as the world's fifth most planted red wine grape. Certain winegrowers in the northern Rh\u00f4ne distinguish between a small-berried, superior version of syrah, which they call petite syrah, and the larger-berried grosse syrah, but others reject any such distinction.</p> <p>Petite sirah (with an i, not a y) is quite different, the name given to what has been shown to be a common California field blend made up variously of syrah, durif and two other varieties related to them. It makes robust, tannic, earthy wines.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Syrah is the great grape of the northern Rh\u00f4ne, responsible for the dense, burly, deep-coloured, long-lived, savoury and peppery wines of Hermitage, and the slightly more seductively perfumed (traditionally thanks to some co-fermented viognier in the blend) C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie. Unlike other varieties, it demonstrates a strict relationship between how severely it is pruned and how good the eventual wine is. It can also lose its aroma and acidity quickly if left past optimal ripening stage (both of which explain why so many, though by no means all, French varietal syrah vins de pays are so wishy-washy). Crozes-Hermitage is probably the best-value manifestation of syrah, although good St Joseph exists and Cornas is enjoying a revival.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Cuttings of syrah, called shiraz, were probably taken to Australia by the so-called father of Australian viticulture, James Busby, in the early 1830s. It flourished and spread, so much so that it was little treasured. Now, however, Australia has regained its pride in what is the country's most planted wine grape variety, which can taste of baked pencils in the Hunter Valley, cough syrup in the Barossa Valley (arguably its spiritual home), chocolate in McLaren Vale and black pepper in cooler parts of Victoria and New South Wales. </p> <p>The great majority of Australian winemakers produce a shiraz of some sort, and many make several qualities of shiraz, as well as a range of shiraz-cabernet blends. Penfolds is arguably the past master of shiraz production - its Grange being Australia's first serious collectable. When it was made, by the late Max Schubert after a trip to Bordeaux, it was dismissed as \"dry port tasting of crushed ants\". In general terms, shiraz tends to taste slightly sweet and can reach high alcohol levels. Such was the success of Australian shiraz in the early years of this century that the name shiraz has been widely adopted for syrah grown in many other parts of the world.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Syrah was enthusiastically planted in California in the 1990s by the so-called Rh\u00f4ne Rangers, who were anxious to demonstrate that it may be even better suited to California than cabernet sauvignon. Wine buyers have been less enthusiastic about it, however. There have been some notable examples in Washington state as well as in South America, particularly Chile. South African shiraz, generally from younger vines, can taste rather earthy and hot. Some of those who make the finest South African examples label them syrah. There are some notable syrahs in both Italy and Iberia, even if the grape remains a minority ingredient in the varietal makeup of vineyards there. It can also make some fine wine in sunnier spots in Switzerland's Valais.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Vin de Pays des Coteaux de l'Ardeche Syrah 2006, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.50, Nicolas</strong></p> <p>Some of the world's best syrah is grown in the northern Rh\u00f4ne, where it makes dark, brooding - and expensive - wines.

  "<p>I am just back from spending a week on the beach in Cornwall and my wife has declared she never wants to go on holiday with me again. Caroline says this every year and the cause is always the same, namely, the fact that I don't stop working. I am that loathed and detested character: the deadbeat dad who is constantly checking his BlackBerry on the beach.</p> <p>My excuse is that, as a freelance journalist, I do not receive any paid holiday. If I stop working, the money stops coming in - and my finances are so precariously balanced that simply forgoing one week's wages could bring the whole house of cards tumbling down. I suffer from what Martin Amis and Christopher Hitchens refer to as \"tramp dread\" - the fear that if you stop churning stuff out you won't merely fall behind on the mortgage, you'll be completely destitute by the end of the month.</p> <p>Needless to say, Caroline doesn't believe this. As far as she's concerned, I'm a workaholic and \"tramp dread\" is just a way of rationalising my pathological compulsion.</p> <p>She may have a point. Even if I won the lottery I think I'd still check my emails on the beach. The truth is, I have no desire to take a break from my day-to-day life. I don't find work stressful. On the contrary, I find not working stressful. If I'm unable to connect to the web for more than a few hours I begin to suffer from acute anxiety. For me, sitting in my car next to an internet cafe at midnight, seeing if I've got any messages on Facebook, is a way of \"decompressing\". </p> <p>My wife isn't alone in finding this irritating. The owner of the cottage we rented just outside Helston told me that she considered putting in a wireless router, but decided against it on the grounds that most people prefer being unplugged when they're on holiday. I have no doubt this is true. Indeed, the vast majority of people are not merely uninterested in connecting to the web while on holiday - they actively despise those who do.</p> <p>I can tell this by the disapproving glances I get from the other men on the beach. In the beach pecking order, a dad clutching a BlackBerry is only one up from a single man with a camera taking pictures of naked children gambolling in the surf. In their eyes, I am one of those sad, career-obsessed twats who just can't switch off.</p> <p>I suspect that this is a peculiarly British prejudice. In America, there is no taboo against remaining in touch with the office. I remember being in a screening at the Sundance Film Festival a couple of years ago when the man sitting in front of me took a call on his mobile. I tapped him on the shoulder and told him to shush, but he ignored me. I tried again and this time he turned round and said, \"It's my agent,\" as if that was a wholly satisfactory explanation. No one else in the cinema batted an eyelid.</p> <p>Why do British holidaymakers find people like me so annoying? My theory is that it's part of the general prejudice against anyone who is seen to be working too hard. This, in turn, is rooted in the 19th-century distinction between those who had a private income and those who had to work for a living. The former were considered \"gentlemen\", while the latter were \"in trade\".</p> <p>That may sound far-fetched, but I'm not suggesting it is a conscious form of snobbery. Like most prejudices, the taboo against working on holiday is formed by historical factors that people aren't aware of. At Cambridge, for instance, I happily used the general term of abuse \"Narg\" to describe anyone studying mathematics or science without knowing its implications. Only later did I discover that Narg stood for Not A Real Gentleman. On holiday, I am undoubtedly a Narg.</p>",
  "<h2>Who should I call for a makeover?</h2> <p><strong>I recently bought a second-floor flat, and need to get it rewired and replumbed. I would also like to open up the kitchen to the living room and install a new kitchen, boiler and central heating - and I'd like it all done as green as possible. The bathroom and kitchen are at opposite ends of the flat, so routing of plumbing and wiring will be tricky. Who do I need to help me? An architect, structural engineer, separate plumber/electrician/builder? I'm baffled!</strong></p> <p>Let's separate the issues. You're not adding volume to your property or interfering with exterior or party walls, so the good news is you're not in the realm of planning permission or even permitted development. But you will have to deal with building regulations, because you're opening up between kitchen and lounge, and there are rules governing fire doors, ventilation, etc. An architect could design the layout, put the job out to tender, project manage it, and deal with any rules and regs - but they don't come cheap: expect to pay a percentage of the overall build cost (about 13% or more). For small jobs, this can be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut (you don't want to spend \u00a310,000 on an architect when your budget's \u00a360,000, say). </p> <p>An architect is really of use when you have no idea how to design a space. You, however, sound as if you know what you want to do. A professional builder used to jobs on this scale should be able to work from your sketches. He'll deal with any structural issues and have plumbers, joiners, electricians, etc, who work with him. You want someone who comes with a recommendation, so visit a property he's recently worked on and talk to the owner. </p> <p>If the wall you're taking down is a serious structural element, you may need an engineer to design 'the steels', or supports, which will go in in its absence. But, again, the advice of a good builder is invaluable. </p> <p>As for your wish to be green, well, replacing your central heating is a good start because you'll upgrade to an efficient system with condensing boiler. If your flat is in the eaves, make sure the roof is well insulated, too.</p> <h2>Can we save our quarry tiles?</h2> <p><strong>The kitchen in our late-Victorian house has its original quarry-tiled floor - sadly covered by the </strong><strong>previous occupants' carpet and, under that, lino glued to the tiles. We'd love to restore them. Could we do it ourselves, or would we be better off calling in a professional?</strong></p> <p>Our DIY expert, Bridget Bodoano, says, 'It's a pretty big job, and messy, but it can be done. Nigel Frost of The Floor Restoration Company (01432 851138, <a href=\"http://www.floor-restoration.co.uk\">floor-restoration.co.uk</a>) says first remove the remnants of lino with a strong metal scraper, then the glue, much of which can be removed with a hot-air gun (about \u00a325, from DIY shops), which will loosen the glue. You'll need a number of scrapers and a fireproof container for the debris. Wear strong gloves (not plastic) and a chemical gas mask, because the fumes may be toxic. Ensure the room has plenty of ventilation and don't use near combustible materials. Remove any remaining glue with abrasive pads, plenty of clean cloths and, if necessary, cellulose thinners.</p> <p>Next, you may find you need to re-grout. Also, if any tiles need replacing, source them from reclamation and salvage yards. Last, scrub the floor, either by hand or machine; if there is still some residue on the surface, use a strong stripper such as Selate Floor Polish Stripper (\u00a35.50, 0845 226 7275, <a href=\"http://www.cleansave.co.uk\">cleansave.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>Jayne Fuller and Emily Sargent* were in senior creative positions in a magazine publishing house, but Fuller was going out with the boss. Sargent arrived, appearing glamorous, intelligent and altogether fabulous. Fuller felt ousted and threatened. </p> <p>\"I just couldn't cope with it. I felt so alienated,\" Fuller says. \"She was the one they all loved and would turn to because she was funny and clever, whereas I was the grumpy one who everyone hated.\" </p> <p>Sargent admits: \"Jayne was the most temperamental person in the office and people pussyfooted around her because she was going out with the boss and because she was the creative director with the licence to throw toys.\" </p> <p>Gather a group of people together, insist they spend large amounts of time in a confined space, then just sit back and watch human nature deal with the rest. The rules of Big Brother apply similarly to the office environment - still the standard backdrop of a regular working life - where we spend more time with strangers (initially) than we do with our friends and family.</p> <p>Hardly surprising, then, that disputes between colleagues are integral to office life. Disputes are the meat and drink of HR departments: whole reams of employment law are devoted to them, thousands of pounds are thrown at their desired resolution - and they drive people insane.</p> <p>But in the end, Fuller and Sargent sorted out the dispute themselves. Fuller says she woke up to the fact that things had to change when Sargent announced she intended to resign. </p> <p>\"It just hit me and I thought, 'this is insane.' So I just said to her that I was really sorry and I thought that all of the tension had been caused by the fact that I was extremely jealous of her.\" </p> <p>Sargent says Fuller's \"disarming honesty\" won her over. \"If it were not for the fact that one of the two conflicting parties shattered the wall of conflict I don't think it would have been resolved,\" says Sargent. Both are now firm friends, having left the company (and Fuller the relationship with her boss) some years ago.</p> <p>Realising that the current four-year-old system of statutory dismissal and grievance procedures is costly and unwieldy, the government will, from April 2009, replace it in favour of informal mediation - that unfashionable notion of getting people to talk to each other rather than dragging everything through the courts. In February Acas - a largely government-funded organisation - was given \u00a337m to help prevent workplace disputes unnecessarily going to employment tribunals. Acas is beefing up its advice helpline which, from next April, will point out to callers that they should try mediation as it may well be cheaper and better for all concerned. If they fail to heed this advice, Acas will conciliate at disputes that look set to become tribunals. </p> <p>\"By the time issues get to tribunals it's generally too late,\" says Mike Emmott, employee relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. The existing system of dispute resolution, he believes, requires all managers \"to play every conflict by the book, watch their backs and do things that would stand up in court rather than settle the case.\" Once statutory rights and employment tribunals are involved, protagonists are obliged to polarise their positions in order to win a legal settlement - not exactly an outcome conducive to mutual resolution. </p> <p>Emmott has just completed a how-to guide to workplace mediation, which typically involves a neutral third party or mediator bringing two opposing individuals together, encouraging them to air their views and then trying to find some mutual agreement. </p> <p>It's good news for private workplace mediators and there are already calls to introduce a system of accreditation. </p> <p>However, mediation is often tried too late, only after a formal grievance procedure has taken place rather than before, says Liz Hine, director of Mediation at Work. Hine recently mediated at a dispute between manager Amanda Edwards and housing support officer Jess Wilson* at a hostel for young homeless people. Wilson had already been subjected to disciplinary action which resulted in her suspension. </p> <p>The nub of the problem appeared to be a personality clash between two entirely different individuals. \"We're like chalk and cheese,\" explains Wilson. \"We've got very different working practices and I just didn't feel as if she liked me very much and I suppose that got my back up. We were locking horns and never got anything sorted out.\" </p> <p>Wilson didn't feel her suspension was warranted and thinks her manager, Edwards, was \"fed a lot of gossip from colleagues which wasn't necessarily true\". A protracted battle ensued which, in the end, they hammered out during a day of mediation. </p> <p>\"Mediation isn't going to change your whole personality,\" says Wilson, \"the problems are still going to be there, but it's about dealing with them.\" It did, however, give them a space to open up honestly, with Hine acting as an impartial referee. </p> <p>During mediation Edwards learned that Wilson wasn't the self-confident adversary she imagined. \"Although she appears confident she doesn't feel confident,\" Edwards says. \"We gained a better understanding of each other and I probably got a better insight into myself. One thing I learned is to nip something in the bud in the initial stages.\" </p> <p>For mediation to work, both parties need to be both honest and constructive. \"It can be quite difficult,\" says Wilson. \"Nobody likes criticism.\" She thinks a few more sessions would have helped them reflect and become a bit more open. \"But it has drawn a line in the sand. My relationship with Amanda is not as strained as it was.\" </p> <p>Although better, relations are still a little raw. \"I hope it settles down,\" says Edwards. \"I think sometimes we just need to get on with our work as opposed to being concerned about whether the person we have sat next to has offered to make us a cup of tea.\"</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Jackie Keddy, a Metropolitan police coach and mediator, agrees that in many cases, an honest conversation at the watercooler might avoid the march down to HR or the courts. \"In most places there are shelves full of policies and protocols but it can be a case of cracking a nut with a hammer,\" she says. \"I believe that organisations will be held accountable if they can't show that mediation has taken place and some tribunals might start to penalise them.\" </p> <p>A little DIY goes a long way, agree primary school teachers Nigel Cullen and Sarah Thompson* who fell out over sandwiches versus hot dogs at their school fete. According to Cullen, Thompson wanted the fete to be about maths. \"I wanted to have a hot dog stand and she insisted there wasn't any maths in that.\" </p> <p>Sandwiches were considered to have greater potential for the weighing and measuring of ingredients than hot dogs. \"The worst thing was, she said the kids should bake their own bread. I said, 'No, I'm not doing that.' So she went to the head, who agreed with her. We sold about two sandwiches, to staff who felt sympathetic.\" </p> <p>Eventually the two agreed to put the sandwich scenario behind them after agreeing to talk their differences through and resolve them - although Cullen insists he's going to do it his way next time.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Names have been changed</p>",
  "<p>'This is called a probe,\" says Lena Vakil, sweeping her hand across a tray of instruments. \"That's the sort of sharp pointy thing that people are always terrified about. They ask you, 'Don't come near me with that!' But it's just to check what the teeth are like, if there's any decay or anything that's not quite right.\"</p> <p>Leaning against the dreaded chair in her black-and-white surgical robe, Vakil's manner could not be more friendly and reassuring. I have never been very afraid of dentists to start with, and the staff at the Docklands Dental Centre in east London, all equipped with perfect smiles, are among the friendliest I have ever met. Yet there is still something undeniably macabre about this set of sterile tools laid out between us in a gleaming line. Tweezers, mirror, drill, syringe, beside which lies a tube of coloured liquid. \"That's a bit more anaesthetic should we need it,\" she explains.</p> <p>Continuing the tour, Vakil leads the way through corridors playing the kind of peaceful, tranquilising music that is only ever heard in the most terrifying places. Finally, we come to another brightly lit room with another large chair, beside which a slightly different tray is waiting. \"So this is all surgical equipment,\" she says. \"These are the scary things.\" </p> <p>And indeed they are: scalpel holders and spare blades, needles, clamps for loosening teeth. \"If someone was coming in to have an extraction,\" she admits, \"I wouldn't show this initially.\" So what would she do? \"We would have the same tray that you just saw there, I'd numb them up, and go through some instructions about how to look after themselves afterwards. Then wait, and everything comes out afterwards ... I think when people see the equipment they start wondering, what are you about to do to me?\"</p> <p>Much of the fear that still persists around dentistry is rooted in the bad old days of 30 or more years ago, when brushing was scarce, and check-ups scarcer. \"People still have memories of what it was like,\" says Vakil, who specialises in the more complex (and potentially frightening) surgical procedures, \"especially if you have parents from the time when it wasn't so advanced. They always remember these terrible stories ... Often we'll have patients who come in, and the mothers are standing there absolutely amazed that their kids are in the chair. But the kids are fine.\"</p> <p>Advances in technology and education have brought dramatic improvements, Vakil believes, and yet dealing with her patients' nerves, as well as their teeth, is still a central part of her work. \"You can tell when someone comes in,\" she says. \"The characteristics come out. When people are anxious they can be quite aggressive ... The first thing they might say is, 'I don't like your sort.' But actually after you've treated them for some time you realise it's just because they're scared. Then you have some patients who can be very, very confident. They seem as though everything's fine. And then you realise they're absolutely terrified ... And some patients will just break down, completely.\"</p> <p>The only thing Vakil can offer, besides a needle full with sedative, is to spend time with her patients, building up trust. For this reason, dentists often inspire remarkable loyalty in the people they treat. \"[Some of] my friends travel miles to see the dentist that they saw when they were young,\" she says. \"And I have some patients who still come over to see me from Denmark. They'll fly over and work things out so they can come and see me. And it's lovely.\"</p> <p>What is most striking, to me at least, is to hear how seriously Vakil, and the rest of her profession by the sound of it, take the softer skills of offering reassurance while they work. The reason, she suggests, is that all dentists begin to deal with patients early in their training. After a year in the classroom, and another practising on what they call a \"phantom head\", all trainees are let loose (under careful supervision) on real mouths and real panics. \"You learn quite early on that you've got to be able to see your patients, treat them, reassure them and do the work all at the same time,\" explains Vakil, with her safe-hands smile. \"I think it just becomes a habit after a while.\"</p> <p>And it was a habit she picked up even earlier than most. Her father, now retired, was himself a dentist, and as a teenager, Vakil used to go and help out around the surgery. \"What I liked,\" she recalls wistfully, \"[was] the fact that he had quite a lot of control about what he was doing ... and when I would go in on summer holidays he would be seeing the same patients again, or members of the same family, or people that were recommended to him.\" With her plan to follow him decided, Vakil chose a spread of maths and sciences for her A-levels, and applied to dental school, where she followed the standard four-and-a-half year course, before studying for a further two years in oral surgery, attached to a hospital.</p> <p>One question has been bugging me, however, which she has not yet even touched on: why teeth? After all she could have enjoyed the variety of the whole human body as a GP, and still been working with people all day. \"I found I enjoyed using my hands, doing something practical,\" she says. \"Whereas, with general practice, you don't necessarily get the opportunity to do that. It tends to be a lot of diagnosing and that kind of work.\"</p> <p>And now, at the age of 40, with 17 years as a qualified dentist behind her, does she notice people's teeth all the time? \"I think we all do,\" she laughs naughtily. Has she been surveying my teeth then? \"No, not at all! Not at all!\" She is insistent, and I just about believe her. \"I think what we do is just look at someone's mouth, make an assessment, and forget about it. It's natural.\"</p> <p>And is she ever revolted by what she sees? There must have been some terrible mouths down the years. \"I've done a lot of surgery,\" she reminds me. \"I'd just qualified, and a person had fallen off a piece of scaffolding, straight down, and this pole had gone right up through his neck, into his skull, and missed the eye. And that was my first night on call, so I was suddenly dealing with this patient. Having had experience of seeing so many terrible things, I suppose it's prepared me quite well. So I don't think anything's too terrible.\"</p> <p>So positive and enthusiastic is Vakil about her work, that she makes me determined to find some drawbacks. How about off-duty diagnosis? Being confronted by people and their ailments in social situations seems to be the bane of many doctors' lives. Vakil nods her head, although it is obvious that she does not mind in the slightest. \"If I go to a dinner party and happen to say to someone that I'm a dentist, inevitably there will be a story from someone or the other,\" she grins. \"And it's quite interesting. I don't know whether if you went to a party and met a lawyer you would necessarily talk to them about it.\" The thought gets another chuckle.</p> <p>\"People say, 'Oh my teeth are terrible ...'\" She shakes her head frantically this time, and covers her mouth with her hand, imitating their shame. \"Or, they'll launch into a whole discussion, and tell me about [their teeth] ... People do think about what's happened to them, and it'll come out one way or another. I quite like it, because it's always easy to talk about. I think it doesn't matter where you go the world over, it's exactly the same.\" </p> <p>At last, however, we do manage to alight on something that bothers her. Although even now she is not so sure. \"'Bother' is a difficult word,\" she says, considering the matter. \"I think sometimes you can be surprised ... I [do sometimes] think, Gosh, you come and see me, and you're in terrible pain, and I know it's not a great experience for you. But we get you out of the pain, we sort the problems out, but we can never get them to come back regularly because they are so terrified. And then you have a vicious circle, because they come back again and they're in terrible pain.\"</p> <p>Frustrating sounds like a good word for it. \"It is quite frustrating, but you just can't dictate to people. I just think sometimes people don't realise the value of what we might be telling them. There is a reason for it.\" In fact, she sounds fairly relaxed about this now, as if this was a battle, with older patients at least, that she has come to accept losing. Her two young daughters, however, are a different matter. And suddenly there is fire in her eyes. \"They're sucking their thumbs at the moment,\" she gasps, \"so I'm not too pleased about that.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay \"</strong>I work part-time, three days in the practice, one day in the hospital. Pro-rata, for five days a week, I would say it would be between about \u00a365,000 and \u00a375,000.\"</p> <p><strong>Hours </strong>9.30 to 5.30 every day. \"But if you wanted to work more, you could. The huge advantage of dentistry is that I can't take my job home.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing </strong>Working with people. \"One of the satisfying things is when someone does come in and they're terrified, and you're able to turn that around. That's brilliant. And being able to do my surgery. I love doing that.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing \"</strong>Wishing you could help more people, and have more of an impact. But I can't change their habits.\"</p>",

Once there he discovers that Infinity Park isn't a theme park at all but a training site for the first children into space. Things rapidly get out of control and Liam winds up as the only \"adult\" on a spaceship with several kids relying on him to get them back down to Earth.</p> <p><strong>The author:</strong> Frank Cottrell Boyce is a screenwriter and author of two previous novels, Millions and Framed. He has seven children and lives in Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>What we said:</strong> \"Funny and engaging and in the end rather moving (though not in a horrible Hollywood 'what have we learned today, children?' kind of way).

Tessa is such a rich character. I really cared about her, didn't like her occasionally, sympathised with her intermittently, rooted for her most of the time, was touched when she opened her heart, didn't want her to go at last while also feeling that strange relief when the time finally came.\" <strong>- Diane Samuels</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To order a copy for \u00a39.99 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875</p> <h2>The Knife of Never Letting Go, by Patrick Ness<br>(Walker, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p><strong>The story:</strong> Girls are banned from Prentisstown, and as the result of a virus, all the men can hear each others' thoughts.

  "<p>Bloss is in the kitchen looking perplexed; her face keeps shifting from tears to elation. With a whisper she confesses to Mrs Cobb: \"There was a spot of blood, I thought it was my monthly but there's been no more and I'm feeling strange - changed. I think I've been bit, stung or had.\"</p> <p>Old Mrs Coleman, who they all thought was deaf, bellows: \"Did you lie with man?\"</p> <p>Bloss blushes. \"No. In that way I am pure.\"</p> <p>\"Maybe it's a tumour,\" Mrs Coleman says.</p> <p>\"That's not a very nice thing to say,\" Bea says.</p> <p>\"She's just joking,\" Mrs Cobb says.</p> <p>\"No I'm not,\" Mrs Coleman says.</p> <p>\"I feel like things are blooming in me, a world is unfolding, a magic kingdom,\" Bloss says.</p> <p>\"Have you ever been examined?\" Mrs Cobb says.</p> <p>\"Not unless you count playing doctor as a child,\" Bloss says.</p> <p>\"Well then it would be a miracle, but it wouldn't be the first time - think of the Blessed Virgin Mary,\" Mrs Coleman says.</p> <p>\"Even if it were true,\" Bea says, \"even if you were preggers, I don't imagine you would be feeling it so soon?\"</p> <p>\"Oh but you might,\" Mrs Cobb says. \"With mine I knew the instant it happened, maybe because I'm a cook, but it was like I heard the egg cracking and the little fucker swimming in, and then from every day on it was like fireworks, cells multiplying right and left.\"</p> <p>Fiddle walks in and Bloss bursts into tears. \"I thought you were off to Cromarty?\" Bloss sniffles.</p> <p>\"We left the drummer's drum and had to come back.\"</p> <p>Before any more can be said, Polly, the former bride to be, is hurled into the kitchen, having caught her shoe on a step, and crashes into a long wooden table. Mrs Cobb, Bloss, Bea, all grab the edges of the table to keep it from going over. Dishes rattle.</p> <p>\"It's a war zone out there, the forest is strewn with sleeping bodies. I woke up as a hunt from another estate was blowing by. Horses and dogs. I jumped up and started to run as though I was the thing they were chasing,\" Polly pauses to draw a breath. She smooths her dress. </p> <p>They all watch. She's still wearing the wedding dress, fitted lavender silk with a shredded train which is like a big puddle around her feet - not surprising she tripped. \"I thought I would have spent my wedding night in a connubial king-sized bed, but instead I slept on a bed of pine needles surrounded by wood nymphs.\"</p> <p>Fiddle shoots Bloss a look and Bloss turns beet red.</p> <p>\"Where is that woman we're giving a ride to, Miss Dry-clean only?\" Fiddle says. \"The band wagon's got to be on its way. We came back for the drum and now we've lost her. She said she was running to the loo, but I think it's more like skip to my lou, if you know what I mean.\" </p> <p>And no one does know what Fiddle means.</p> <p>\"When I arrived at this haunted hall, the plan was that I'd leave a married woman, but look at me, not only is my life a ruin and the world around me in crumbles, but I'm having some sort of allergic reaction.\"</p> <p>She blinks, and for the first time everyone notices that her eyes are very red and swollen. \"Some little puck ran round in the night with glow-in-the-dark eye drops, which swelled my eyes closed. I was more than half blind when I woke up and coming back here the first thing I saw was the blurry detail of a woman in the driveway trying to load a donkey into the passenger seat of her car. She kept saying, 'Sit, you pretty boy', and then kissing the donkey on the lips. Do donkeys have lips? 'Sit, you pretty boy', and then a loud kiss. It was quite startling and, even odder, I could have sworn I saw the donkey give her a bit of tongue, a kind of kiss back.\" Again she stops for a breath. Mrs Cobb hands her a cool damp cloth and motions that she should put it on her eyes. Polly takes the cloth and blots her entire face. \"What does it say about me?\" she says.</p> <p>\"You're very sensitive, you must have touched something, like a weed, and then rubbed your eyes,\" Mrs Coleman says.</p> <p>Polly, not listening, goes on, \"Does it imply that I am unlucky in love? Did I blow the one good thing? Am I destined to be an old maid, an also-ran? Do you think I overreacted? Should I have just let him have his way - that is what men expect isn't it, just to have their way? And what was it about a silly photographer that got me so upset? It's a wedding, there should be photographs - shouldn't there?\"</p> <p>\"Did you love him?\" Bloss asks.</p> <p>\"How would I know,\" Polly says. \"When the thing itself is just before you, it's hard to know what you feel. It's only in its absence that true love blooms.\"</p> <p>A shriek of hysterical laughter from the drawing room sends them all skittering out of the kitchen and through the great hall. And there in the drawing room, which is now flooded with morning sun, is Helen, the dry-clean only, hunkered down over the Hinxted Hall house computer - ie the one computer that's left out for the guests to peruse nearby attractions and the evening menu. Helen is there, watching as pictures load from someone's personal thingamajiggy that's plugged into the side port. \"I just touched the keyboard thinking I might be able to check my email. The screen came on - and I found this,\" Helen says, turning the screen so they can all see a full colour image of the donkey and the woman going at it.</p> <p>\"Do you think they Photoshopped the donkey or did that really happen?\" Helen asks.</p> <p>\"The image is untouched,\" says a tousled Jack Mercury sitting up on the sofa - the commotion has disrupted his sleep. The slideshow continues a depraved documentary about how the evening unfolded, ending with a large knife jabbed through the uneaten wedding cake. \"Who did that?\" Mrs Coleman wants to know. That cake was kept in a special room off the kitchen.</p> <p>\"I confess, it was me,\" says Jack Mercury, \"I was looking for a way to end the piece.\"</p> <p>\"You mean the magazine is going to run this?\" Polly asks.</p> <p>\"They are so excited, I called the editor in the middle of the night and told her everything! In the end I think it may be my best work.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Conservative MP yesterday revealed that he had been held at gunpoint by soldiers in Colombia who mistook his coffee whitener for cocaine.</p> <p>Michael Fabricant, 58, the MP for Lichfield and Burntwood, was forced to gulp down several mouthfuls of Coffee-mate to prove he was not carrying drugs as M16 assault rifles and a machine gun were trained on him.</p> <p>He had been trekking with a friend through mountains near Santa Marta on the Caribbean coast when he was stopped by an armed patrol. Seven soldiers searched his bag and pulled out an unmarked container containing a white substance.</p> <p>Though Fabricant is fluent in French and German, and has some command of Dutch and Russian, he cannot speak Spanish. \"It took some explanation, as I don't speak more than two or three words in Spanish, for them to accept it was Coffee-mate. All they kept shouting at me was 'cocaine, cocaine! Coffee brown, coffee brown'. In their eyes I was carrying raw concentrated cocaine, which I suppose does look quite similar,\" he said.</p> <p>Fabricant suggested the soldiers taste the powder themselves, but they refused. \"One of them gestured with the butt of his rife for me to sample it instead. I took several mouthfuls and they looked at me as if I was crazy.\"</p> <p>Then, he told the BBC yesterday, \"they waited a few minutes to see if I collapsed or went delirious and said something completely ridiculous like, I don't know, 'Gordon Brown's got a great personality'. But when I didn't say anything too weird they came to the conclusion that it wasn't cocaine and let me go.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I was incredibly relieved although, I have to admit, afterwards I felt as sick as a dog.\"</p> <p>He was eventually released and allowed to continue his two-week holiday, although shaken by the experience.</p> <p>\"I'm a Conservative MP for a small sleepy city in Staffordshire, I'm not exactly the archetypal cocaine baron. It was hairy stuff. There were seven heavily-armed young men on a foot patrol who approached us as we were walking along a jungle trail.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I knew Colombia could be a little dangerous, as there is kidnapping and a major drug industry. But I was in a range of mountains north-east of Santa Marta on the coast, which is not generally considered to be drug baron country and is relatively safer than the inland areas.\"</p> <p>Lessons had been learned, he said. \"I would not wish to unnecessarily cause the risk of a byelection. Next time, I'll make sure the jar is labelled.\"</p> <p>Keen to avoid a diplomatic crisis, Fabricant told the BBC yesterday that although Colombian coffee was \"really very, very good\", he did not trust the local milk, which is why he had brought the coffee whitener with him.</p>",

  "<p>He came to office as Motown's hip-hop mayor, saying that God had chosen him to lead and that he would \"never quit on\" the people he had been elected to serve.</p> <p>But after six years as mayor of Detroit, Kwame Kilpatrick has stepped down after he was found to have lied about an extra-marital affair with his chief-of-staff.</p> <p>In a Detroit court on Thursday, Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to charges of obstruction of justice. He faces four months in prison. Under a plea bargain, he agreed to pay the city $1m (\u00a3565,000) in restitution and serve five years on probation, during which he cannot hold public office.</p> <p>It was unclear when Kilpatrick would step down. While prosecutors said he would go immediately, Kilpatrick said he would leave on September 18, shortly before a formal sentencing hearing. As the Detroit Free Press, which was instrumental in uncovering Kilpatrick's perjury, noted: \"Until he leaves, Detroit will be run by an admitted felon.\"</p> <p>The end of Kilpatrick's reign can be traced back to a raucous party that may or may not have taken place in late 2002 at the mayor's official residence, the Manoogian Mansion. Among the exotic dancers allegedly hired to perform at the party was Tamara Greene, 27.</p> <p>In one version of events, the mayor's wife, Carlita, returned home to find a scene that was not to her liking, and attacked Greene. A whistleblower accused Kilpatrick of abusing his authority to hush up the party. Prosecutors said a $8.4m award to three police officers was intended to keep the matter out of the courts.</p> <p>Greene was murdered at the end of April 2003 in a drive-by shooting. The investigation into the shooting uncovered text messages between Kilpatrick and his chief-of-staff, Christine Beatty. Despite Kilpatrick's denials of an affair with Beatty and his efforts to keep the messages secret, 14,000 were released to the public.</p> <p>The fallout will continue as prosecutors investigate some of the city officials he appointed. One, police chief Ella Bully-Cummings, resigned on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>Empathy lives! If you've ever doubted your ability to feel compassion for your fellow man, try sitting through the recent DFS commercial in which various out-of-work actors have to mime along to the shit Nickelback song Rockstar without squirming yourself half to death with embarrassment-by-proxy. The sorrow and humiliation is overpowering. I can barely stand to watch. Which bit's the worst? The bit where the porky thirtysomething bloke does air guitar, or the bit where the old woman in sunglasses mouths the chorus? Bet they had to repeatedly halt the shoot because people were completely breaking down on camera - collapsing into helpless shuddering fits. Having sex with a dying goose in exchange for basic rations on some apocalyptic porn site would be less demeaning.</p> <p>The only thing in the universe more shameful than old people miming rock songs is the sight of white people rapping. Not all white people, you understand - about 15% are good at it. The rest come across like Leslie Nielsen in an unseen and un-filmed Naked Gun sequence in which Lieutenant Frank Drebin has to black up and infiltrate a hip-hop video shoot. (In the 1980s, it was the law that every family movie or sitcom had to include a bit where the \"Dad\" character performed a rap, replete with lots of hand gestures and the word \"yo\", although the practice was eventually abandoned when audiences began committing suicide en masse).</p> <p>Consider that a protracted warning about <strong>Scene Stealers (Sat, 12.30pm, BBC2)</strong>, a new teenage \"life swap\" show which as of this nanosecond forms part of the BBC's yoof strand Switch. Essentially an amiable take on the Faking It format (or a shameless rip-off, depending on whether you own the rights to it or not), Scene Stealers is all about tribes. Teenage tribes.</p> <p>Of course being part of a tribe is easier when you're young, although some types age quicker than others. Stay slim and you can convincingly pull off the Camden indie kid look into your early 30s. Goths spoil sooner. They start to look a bit tatty around the age of 25. Still, no matter which tribe you've chosen, there comes a point where you've just got to admit defeat. I dimly recall seeing men in their 50s still walking around dressed as teddy boys in the late-70s and early-80s. Even as a child I knew it was heartbreaking.</p> <p>So if you must experiment with tribery, the full bloom of youth is the only sensible time to do it. This week's Scene Stealers takes two slightly posh kids and tries to transform them into south London rappers. Just to make things that bit more difficult, both kids are firm tribe members already. The first, Nikita, is a \"plastic\". I'm pretty certain they've made this \"tribe\" up especially for the programme: basically \"plastics\" dress and act like they're in Girls Aloud. The other is Josh, who looks like Howard Jones and describes himself as \"an alternative 80s punk\". He's got a synth in his bedroom and knows the chords to Gary Numan's cars.</p> <p>Josh and Nikita are whisked to London to meet their mentors - two aspiring rappers called Fret-Deezy and Rampz, who have 48 hours to turn them into convincing Channel U types who spit rhymes and rep their endz and all dat. It'd be more interesting to Fret-Deezy and co become punks, but that's doubtless in store for week two. </p> <p>In the meantime, this episode inevitably builds to a climax where Josh and Nikita have to rap in front of a panel of hip-hop \"experts\". Nikita's not bad. Josh grew up on a farm. How good do you think he's going to be?</p> <p>No successful rapper has ever hailed from a farm. It's one of the immutable laws of creation. During his gruesome rap, you'll pray for the DFS ad to appear, just for some light relief. But it won't, because this is the BBC. You're stuck watching him flounder.</p> <p>Overall: harmless fun, provided you're 19 or under. Any older and it'll make you feel like a wheezing cadaver. That's not a tribe, that's your future, that is.</p>",

Roger's most famous find was 6,705 medieval gold and silver coins dating from 1272, known as the Reigate Hoard. He found them buried in two pots in 1990, and 301 of them are now on display in the British Museum.</p> <p>At his home in Reigate, Surrey, Roger shows us 25 groats and pennies from the hoard, now mounted in a glass case. We're looking at currency from the reigns of Edward III, Henry V and Henry VI. Many of the coins were sold at auction and Mintey made \u00a3200,000 from his extraordinary find when it was declared treasure trove. He shows us some more finds, including Celtic and Roman coins, horse brasses, horseshoes, lead bullets and a dummy grenade. He also shows us photos of an unexploded bomb he once discovered. </p> <p><strong>Going solo</strong></p> <p>We place two metal detectors, a sharp spade, screwdriver and hand-sized mini-detector into the back of Roger's car and drive to a field seven miles outside Reigate. We're joined by fellow metal detectors Cristabelle and Derek. Cristabelle shows the girls two halves of a stunning, surprisingly heavy, Roman brooch she found. \"There was a three-year gap between finding one half and the other,\" she says.</p> <p>A herd of cows gazes curiously at us from across a barbed-wire fence. Roger explains the basics of using a detector, which involves using a sweeping motion of the search coil and waiting for a bleep and high reading of conductivity on the control panel.</p> <p>The girls are surprisingly interested. They grab a detector and move down the field. Nell has donned headphones to look the part. A machine that goes bleep is really all you need to keep children interested. Nicola admires the views of the Surrey hills and says, \"It's interesting, isn't it?\"</p> <p>When I have a go with the detector, it feels as if I'm minesweeping in Afghanistan. Roger says metal detectors don't sweep fields methodically like geophysicists. They go where their intuition takes them. </p> <p>Roger gets a loud bleep. We gather round as he excavates a neat circle with a spade and flips up 4in of turf and soil. As Roger prods the mound with a screwdriver, Nell exclaims, \"Is it money? Look, a worm!\" If this were Bonekickers on television, we would surely have a piece of Boudicca's chariot and a nail from the true Cross. Finally, Roger emerges with a crushed piece of can. \"But it's a really old can!\" enthuses Nell, undaunted.</p> <p>We discover a rusty old blade from a horse-drawn plough. Then Lola exclaims, \"Look, I've got a really high reading!\" We dig again and unearth a metal nozzle from a tube of penicillin used on cows to prevent mastitis. These are the curse of metal detectors, so Roger tells us.</p> <p>When it's my turn to sweep the field, I discover something gleaming. \"It's gold!\" says Nell. But no, it's a foil bottle top with \"bovine\" written on it. At least we're learning about animal husbandry. And the girls seem to enjoy making any kind of find. But then, fighting for control of the detector, they get another reading. We dissect the clod of earth and find a large coin. \"This could be the second Reigate hoard!\" I say.</p> <p>Roger casts an expert eye over the coin and assesses its size. \"That's a George III halfpenny. It would have been in circulation between 1800 and 1820.\"</p> <p>\"Wow!\" exclaims Nell.</p> <p>\"That was probably someone's wages,\" muses Nicola. Metal detecting certainly gives you a link to the past. Two hundred-odd years ago, an agricultural labourer's coin slipped through a hole in his pocket and today it has touched a human hand again. We find another two eroded halfpennies before the end of the afternoon, along with a metal washer. </p> <p>By now the girls have discovered that two metal detectors placed on top of each other make a noise something like the Clangers, so it's probably best to leave. But on the train home they remain enthusiastic. \"It was really cool,\" says Lola, holding the halfpenny she has taken home with the landowner's permission. \"I loved it!\" adds Nell, despite the lack of Bratz in a treasure chest. Both my daughters, it now seems, are heavily into metal.</p> <p><strong>Your turn </strong></p> <p>Visit the National Council for Metal Detecting website at <a href=\"http://www.ncmd.co.uk\">ncmd.co.uk</a> for groups and activities in your area.

  "<p>Aged six, Laura Alcoba knew to keep quiet about the secret ceiling hatch where her parents hid their guns and militant newspapers. She promised herself that even if the Argentinian military death squads tortured her, burned her with an iron or drove nails into her knees, she wouldn't talk. Not like the toddler who, when the police squad arrived at his parents' home, innocently pointed to the painting hiding their weapons cache, landing the whole family in prison. Barely into primary school, Alcoba saw herself as a dutiful mini-militant assisting her leftwing activist parents in their struggle against an oppressive state. She knew to keep an eye out for police spies, such as the pretty lady who sat in a black car outside her grandparents' house all day, knitting. She learned to check whether she and her parents were being followed in the streets in Buenos Aires - inventing a way of doing three hopscotch jumps and turning round, because a little girl constantly looking behind her was less suspicious than a grown-up. </p> <p>From 1976 to 1983, Argentina's military dictatorship waged the so-called dirty war against its opponents. Tens of thousands of people suspected of being dissidents or subversives were kidnapped, tortured, killed or \"disappeared\" and Argentinian society is still trying to heal its wounds. But only now is a generation of people in their 30s digging into its painful memories of what it was like to be the children of militants, activists and trade unionists driven underground into hiding. </p> <p>Alcoba's new memoir, The Rabbit House, told through the eyes of a seven-year-old, is the first account of a child whose militant parents were at war with the state. She describes life hidden away in a safe-house while her mother's face appeared on \"wanted\" notices, taking on a fake identity aged seven and carrying the huge burden of silence and fear that something she said could give her mother away and see her killed. Her story of a childhood in hiding and perpetually \"on the alert\" has been a publishing success in Argentina and sparked emotional letters from readers, such as those who remember going into hiding with their Jewish parents in France during the second world war, or a Cambodian who said it mirrored her childhood under the Khmer Rouge. Yet Alcoba's story of the militant community also touches on a different family horror that was very specific to Argentina's dirty war: the illegal adoption by couples close to the dictatorship of babies of leftwing activists who were killed.</p> <p>Alcoba, now 39, teaches Spanish literature at a Paris university. Pictures of her children decorate her flat, in contrast to the lack of photos from her own childhood, which was too risky to capture on film. In the early 1970s, Alcoba's young parents were journalists at El Dia, a daily local paper in La Plata, 55km outside Buenos Aires. But by 1975, when Alcoba was six, both her parents were involved in the Montonero movement, a leftwing Peronist guerrilla group. By then, Alcoba was used to spending long periods at her grandparents' house for safety while her father waited for his fake documents and a new name. Then her father was arrested and sent to prison. </p> <p>One afternoon, her grandparents said they were taking her to the park to see her mother. It had been three months since she'd last seen her. She sat on a park bench waiting. A woman with short, bright red hair turned up who Alcoba didn't know. After some confusion, she assumed it must be her mother, who until now had long brown hair. \"The moment you don't recognise your own mother, there are no more reference points. Nothing is fixed and there's nothing to hang on to, not even the maternal face,\" she says. Did she ask her mother why she had dyed her hair flame-red? \"No, we talked very little. There was such urgency, such fear. There were no conversations, it was too dangerous. From day to day we just had to keep the secret, to survive.\"</p> <p>Her mother told her: \"Now we are going to go underground.\" In 1976, after a series of short-term safe-houses, they arrived at a semi-derelict house where the Montoneros were to build printing presses for Alcoba's mother to produce an underground newspaper. Rabbit hutches provided the cover as a rabbit farm. Mother and daughter had to change their identities and spend most of their time out of sight. </p> <p>\"It might seem strange, but for a little girl in that situation being in hiding just becomes part of everyday life,\" says Alcoba. \"She learns very quickly that in winter it's cold, fire burns and we could be killed at any moment. But it's overwhelming for a little girl because of the seriousness of any little gaffe she might make that could put the group in danger. She doesn't always manage what she is supposed to say and not say. It's as if she's in a costume that's too difficult to wear.\"</p> <p>Alcoba slept with her mother in a tiny bedroom tucked at the back of the house. From the start, she tried to be the perfect young militant, but in her innocent slip-ups and constant fear of doing something wrong, she knew she was a liability. One time, she unthinkingly took out her camera and went to photograph one of her favourite militants, sparking his fury. When, under a new false identity, she started school, another militant discovered that her blazer still had her old family name written in it and fumed that the \"kid\" would get them all killed. So she was pulled out of school. \"I'm not up to the job,\" she nervously repeated to herself. She feared the rightwing death squads could swoop at any minute. </p> <p>Twice Alcoba was taken by her grandparents to visit her father in prison. But soon even that became too risky. Mostly, she only left the house to buy bread as cover to check death-squad patrols. Inside the house, she helped disguise the newspapers in wrapping paper as presents to be delivered. She served tea at militant meetings and tried to avoid having her mid-afternoon snack at the kitchen table when others were cleaning their guns. \"It was extreme solitude,\" Alcoba says. The only time she met a child in the same situation was on an errand to deliver the underground papers. The woman who collected the papers brought her young daughter, who looked as scared as Alcoba felt. The woman had been tortured, Alcoba was told, but she never betrayed anyone. </p> <p>How did the family relationship suffer? \"One aspect was the silence,\" Alcoba says. \"We censored ourselves during that period. You are so afraid of saying something that you shouldn't say that you don't say anything at all. It prevents you from having the same kind of relationships you would other-wise. I know it has taken me a long time to talk freely, to be able to talk without asking myself, 'What do I have the right to say? Where is the limit?' It creates a certain mentality - you police yourself, you leave things unsaid.\"</p> <p>Alcoba clung to her friendship with Diana and Daniel, the other activists who lived at the safe-house, a bourgeois, well-dressed couple far from being suspected as leftwing militants. Diana was pregnant during Alcoba's stay, so was even less likely to attract the attention of the police. </p> <p>But before Diana gave birth, Alcoba's mother decided to flee into exile in France. With her father still in prison, Alcoba stayed behind, living with her grandparents for two and a half years until she was able to leave for Paris at the age of 10 to join her. \"I remember the reunion with my mother in France so well. The first thing I asked her was, \"How is Diana?\" She looked at me and said: \"They were killed.\" </p> <p>Only a few months after she and her mother had left the house, the death squad swooped, acting on information from another militant-turned-informant. It was the most violent military attack in La Plata. Every militant present was killed. But Clara Anah\u00ed, Diana's baby, then three months old, was never found. Her relatives suspect she was taken by the death squads and given to a pro-junta family. Hundreds of children of activists are thought to have been illegally adopted in this way by their parents' murderers or their accomplices. Since the publication of Alcoba's book, several women aged 32 with doubts about their adoptions have come forward to have DNA tests to see if they are Clara Anah\u00ed. But she has never been found. \"I hope she's alive, but there's a doubt,\" Alcoba says.</p> <p>She thinks the hardest thing for a family that has been in hiding is the guilt. \"It takes a very long time to be able to talk about it and get over the guilt. There's the guilt of the parents for putting the child in a situation that isn't for children. There's also a guilt specific to this type of experience, which is the guilt of the survivor: to have got through it when so many people died.\"</p> <p>For Alcoba, joining her mother in exile in Paris was a difficult transition. Her mother was grieving for all the friends she had lost and was unable to talk about the trauma. \"At the start, I think the solitude I had felt in Argentina was even stronger in France. It was hard to make friends my age because it was so complicated to explain everything, especially the fact that my father was still in prison. In my head I still lived in Argentina.\"</p> <p>She only began to make friends at school after her father's release when she was 14. In Europe, her parents turned from politics to writing, but they only spent one year together in France before divorcing and her father moved to Barcelona. Because of his time in prison, Alcoba's bond with her father has always been based on letters. \"My father and I spent very little time living together, but our epistolary relationship was still a big relationship to me. I know my love of literature comes from that exchange.\" </p> <p>\"People have said this is a story of stolen childhood,\" Alcoba says. \"But I think it would be obscene to complain of my lost childhood when so many people lost their lives. It was violent, but it was a childhood all the same.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Rabbit House: An Argentinian Childhood by Laura Alcoba is published by Portobello Books at \u00a312.99.</p>",
  "<p>This letter is necessarily brief as I am currently in a secluded village in rural Greece. Nevertheless I cannot let pass the opportunity to add my support to the view of John Harris on the regulation of the sale and supply of alcohol (Brown must call time on the booze trade's lack of restraint, September 2), and equally to the view of Michael Hann on the importance of the public role in challenging unruly behaviour (Why we should step in to halt bad behaviour, G2, September 3). These are two of the critical challenges facing society in the UK today.</p> <p>The private sector has shown itself incapable of effective self-regulation in the sale and supply of alcohol. Harris has made an important contribution to the debate on such regulation. The government now has a role to play. With regard to the public role in challenging unruly behaviour, it is worth recalling that, almost 200 years ago, the police service was created on the understanding that the police were the public and the public were the police. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to participate in the maintenance of an orderly society.</p> <p>This is not always easy and can involve some risk, but in reality the probability of harm remains low. Hann is correct in suggesting that challenging disorder should not be seen as a political matter.<br><strong>Mike Craik</strong><br>Chief constable, Northumbria police, and Acpo lead on licensing </p> <p>I agree with Michael Hann's attitude towards antisocial behaviour. I too \"interfere\" when I see bad behaviour in the street, on public transport etc. I too regard it as the duty of all right-minded people to \"interfere\", but I have seen the looks of embarrassment and fear on other people's faces when they observe me in pursuit of a child beater, litter lout, vandal etc. I rarely get any support from passersby or fellow travellers. However, I have occasionally received more abuse from the person(s) I am defending than the offenders! What is that about?<br><strong>Diana Brown</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>Karen Elson is the new face of John Lewis and there aren't many models who would welcome the department store's reasons for hiring her. Officially, the 29-year-old is an \"iconic British model for an iconic British brand\", but according to a store spokesman she was chosen for the autumn campaign in part because, unlike Kate Moss, she isn't \"too 'fashion'. And she's kind of ageless. Sometimes she looks 15, sometimes 40.\" If you want to see what the imprint of a mobile phone looks like on your face, try that line on Naomi Campbell. </p> <p>Elson, however, is delighted to be someone with whom \"normal\" women can identify. This is partly the lure of novelty; from the time she allowed a photographer to shave off her eyebrows, \"odd\" has been Elson's hallmark, although up close she looks no odder than most models - that is, like the result of a tangential branch of evolution. Her tangerine hair and suet-white skin - properties about which she was self-conscious in school - are today worth thousands of dollars an hour. Her marriage to Jack White, lead singer of the White Stripes and the Raconteurs, and her frank criticism of the fashion business have given Elson a reputation for sense beyond the usual silly strictures of her industry. </p> <p>She was always thin, she says, a \"geeky girl from Manchester\" who in her early teens was so tall and gawky that her nickname was \"skinny whippet\". At school in Oldham, she was in the hurdles team and classmates would yell out her nickname as she flew around the track. Mortified, she tried to bulk up by cooking big, doughy meals for herself. \"I would buy Get Fat cookbooks, I kid you not.\" She has a twin sister, Kate, and two much older half-brothers; her parents separated when she was seven. Her father, a joiner, now lives in a caravan in Clitheroe, Lancashire, and her mother is in Lytham St Annes. Elson hasn't lived at home since she was 16, when her mother, to cheer her up one summer holiday, took her to a modelling agency in Manchester. After doing a few local catalogue jobs, she got a job in Paris, where she went through the young model's rite of passage - sleeping on a mattress in a bug-infested flat and hovering in the wings with 1,000 other hopefuls. No one else on the circuit looked or talked like her, and Elson rose to the next level. </p> <p>The relationship between fashion and eating disorders is so laboriously denied, both by the industry and by sufferers themselves, that it has become a benchmark delusion, as established as the emperor's new clothes. There's an argument that skeletal models aren't technically anorexic; since it's in their economic interests to be thin, theirs is an unfortunate but rational decision, rather than, as \"true\" anorexics might have it, a control mechanism for other issues. Except, says Elson, that isn't true at all. When in her late teens and already highly successful, she was told by a stylist to lose weight. The fact that it was a requirement of the job didn't make her feel any less awful, or alter the lunacy of the request - which was, in effect, to become body dysmorphic. \"I know I'm a skinny woman,\" Elson says. \"That was the biggest head trip for me. It's not like I ever looked in the mirror and said, 'Oh, I'm fat.' But then: this person thinks I am. Which is weird. It's fucking bizarre.\" </p> <p>She continues: \"It messed my mind up, this idea of knowing what I knew and going against it. It made me angry and a bit resentful; like having golden handcuffs - this amazing job that I'm in, but at the same time the idea of being that thin was a real quandary. It becomes, what?\"</p> <p>Elson says she has never had an eating disorder, though for a while she lived with the hall-of-mirrors effect of not trusting what she saw in front her. \"As an 18-year-old, you have a sense of self, and all of a sudden an adult is saying you should lose a bit of weight. It's so wrong. Who in their right mind would say that to a young woman?\" </p> <p>It's so rare for a model to say anything of this nature or to criticise the joyless elements of her business - \"Personally, I'm tired of looking through pages of magazines and seeing dead faces\" - that these obvious statements have the weight of revelation. Elson says she doesn't care. \"I can be pregnant and they still want to take a picture of me, so I don't have to conform to that. And I don't. I don't care.\" And if, as she believes, the weight debate is just a question of perspective, then the anti-fashion lot have to calm down, too. \"It's one of the few jobs where women are actually making a lot of money, and if you can be smart about it and business-minded and not messed up in the head, it can do good by you.\"</p> <p>Elson is fortunate that, while entry-level models have only their thinness to promote them, supermodels are permitted a \"personality\" in place of an eating disorder. In terms of self-regulation, she thinks Britain is ahead of the US - the Fashion Council is quite sensible about model sizes, and John Lewis's own Size Normal campaign was worthwhile. But, she says, it's not enough. She did a shoot recently with a bunch of young unknowns who were \"horrendously thin. And you know that it's not natural. It's impossible to look like that.\"</p> <p>What did she do?</p> <p>\"It's hard, because the motherly part of me wants to go up to them and say, are you OK? But there's so much denial. Ultimately, it's the industry that can do more. I've heard a lot of fashion people say, 'Oh, it's not fashion's fault.' And I'm like, erm, yes it is, because you're the ones telling these young models that they're too fat when they're eight and a half stone. Give me a break.\"</p> <p>She met her husband three years ago on the set of his video for Blue Orchid. With showbiz elan, they were married on a boat in the Amazon and now live in Nashville with their two young children. If there is a sadness to moving so far from her origins, Elson is pragmatic about it. \"Yes, there's a sadness... But at the same time I'm really happy that I left it behind. Thank God for it, because I have no idea what I'd be doing now if it hadn't been for that. Because once you get a taste for travelling and another kind of life, you don't ever want to go back to maybe stacking shelves at Tesco. Or having the career's adviser say, you'd do a very good job as a secretary or school teacher. I love my family and where I'm from, but I was such a shy, insecure person that I would never have broken free from that if I hadn't left home. I would never have thought that I was beautiful, or have the confidence to do what I've done, or have the interests I have now. I count it as a blessing.\"</p> <p>Elson's parents have been sensible about her success in that \"they are pleased, but they don't take the piss. They're not knocking on my door saying, 'Where's my piece of the pie?'\" She describes her mother as \"a lovely, good, northern woman. Also really tough, incredibly independent.\" She describes her father as \"jolly and eccentric\". He could have been an entertainer, she says. Jack White is predictably taken with the whole scene (he called his last White Stripes album Icky Thump, a corruption of a northern term Elson hammily uses, \"ecky thump\").</p> <p>They moved to Nashville on a whim, thinking it a better place than New York to bring up children. Elson would like to open a neighbourhood vintage store. She can't take credit for styling Jack. \"Obviously in the White Stripes he's always in red, white and black. But in the Raconteurs he's got this really interesting 30s Orson Welles look going on right now. He's got taste.\"</p> <p>How does he view her job?</p> <p>\"He views it quite curiously, but never negatively. A lot of people have real hang-ups about models; the idea of being a model. What do you do? It confuses people. When I say I'm a model, they go... Well, first of all they probably don't really think that I am. 'Really?' But Jack views it like, wow, that's really interesting; he appreciates beautiful photography. It's good to be with a man who respects what I do for a living.\" </p> <p>Did he think he was punching above his weight when he asked her out? \"I don't know. It's fate, isn't it? When you meet someone, you just meet them and the powers that be bring you together. Anyone who knows us knows that we're very well suited.\"</p> <p>She'll take the kids back to Oldham for holidays and work when she wants to, which is usually a couple of times a month. \"I'm getting on a bit,\" she says (she will be 30 in January), which is another reason to break rank and do what she wants. \"When I'm in my 50s, I want to think, rather than wasn't I used and abused - wasn't that great? Wasn't that fun and interesting? And, at the same time, wasn't I in control?\"</p>",
  "<p>Television was always wary of football soaps. As Jack Charlton once pointed out, most actors have the wrong-shaped legs. The series which had a team managed by a woman could at least claim a degree of prescience given the success of Karren Brady as Birmingham City's managing director but try running the following scenario past a sceptical head of drama.</p> <p>There is this northern club that has won nothing of significance for 30 years, while their local rivals have won just about everything that moves several times over. They think they have hit the jackpot when a deposed prime minister from south-east Asia, who is worth a bob or two, takes over but he is charged with corruption back home and his assets are frozen. Not to worry. An even richer backer from the Middle East buys him out and promises to make the club the biggest in the world by buying all the best players, money no object.</p> <p>At which point the TV executive will be calling security. Francis Lee once remarked that Manchester City would win cups for cock-ups. Certainly if this one goes pear-shaped City will be out on their own as the kings of Snafu. </p> <p>If Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim has his way Mark Hughes, the new City manager, will eventually have the enviable if unlikely task of deciding how best to accommodate Robinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in an attack which not so long ago was blessed with the talents of Shaun Goater and Darren Huckerby.</p> <p>Al Fahim represents the Abu Dhabi United Group, which is not a branch of the Old Trafford supporters club but is backed by the United Arab Emirates royal family, who are a trillion or so better off than the Windsors. Having made the most dramatic desert entrance since Omar Sharif shimmered into view in Lawrence of Arabia, Al Fahim needs to learn that success in football amounts to rather more than throwing camel-loads of cash around, that Chelsea had a firm team base even before Roman Abramovich arrived, and that the greater array of big names a club buys the greater is the need for a strong manager able to handle the moods and egos of a dressing room of squillionaires.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson has managed this for more than 20 years at Manchester United, Luiz Felipe Scolari will expect to do so at Stamford Bridge and if Al Fahim, who has also talked of hiring such fading stars as Thierry Henry and the other Ronaldo, wants to be taken seriously he will allow Hughes the last say in who comes and goes at Eastlands.</p> <p>Yet to judge by the way the game has been behaving this week this could be a tall order. The message from the resignations of Kevin Keegan at Newcastle United and Alan Curbishley at West Ham United is that managers are less likely than ever to get the final say on who plays and how they play.</p> <p>Curbishley walked out because he felt that players were being sold behind his back. Keegan was angry because Newcastle wanted to offload players he wanted to keep but also for the more fundamental reason that in his view Dennis Wise, the club's director of football, was influential in team matters which would normally be the manager's preserve.</p> <p>The fact that Keegan was prepared to argue the point for three days suggested either that he had mellowed or needed the money. The old Keegan would have walked out the moment Wise was appointed. Curbishley's record in the transfer market was less than distinguished given that West Ham paid Freddie Ljungberg a reported \u00a36m to go away. Nevertheless the background to his departure was a measure of the way football has gone since the days when a medium-sized, family-owned club could thrive in the top division and occasionally offer a serious challenge, as John Lyall's Hammers did in 1985-86.</p> <p>When Bill Kenwright, the chairman of Everton, nine times league champions, pleads for a billionaire to buy the club it is clear that in the Premier League the playing field, far from being level, is now outsloping Yeovil's old lopsided pitch at the Huish. The issues involving Keegan and Curbishley arose because club owners are realising the need to trim wages bills which have been inflated in part by the exorbitant salaries paid by Chelsea under Abramovich and passed on down the table.</p> <p>It would be ironic if the arrival of Al Fahim at Manchester City finds even Chelsea facing rising salaries which had not been bargained for. Their chief executive, Peter Kenyon, could have been right after all when he predicted a while back that the future of the football world was blue. He was just wrong about the shade.</p>",
  "<p>The smell of death around this government is so overpowering it seems to have anaesthetised them all. One bungle follows another and yet those about to die sit silently by. So is that it - the great September relaunch, the great economic recovery plan?</p> <p>The problem is not lack of substance but absurdly grandiose expectations, raised mostly by briefings from No10 suggesting that there were magic answers. The ineptitude of Brown's Downing Street worsens by the week. The shrinking band of those he trusts are now his old rottweilers, who shred what's left of their leader's reputation. This week when they mauled Alistair Darling for telling an obvious truth (his actual words much exaggerated in the reporting), they attacked one of Brown's few truly loyal friends and a decent man. This is the sign of an inner cabal out of control. Brown apparently denies he orders these attacks on others, but fails to sack those who carry them out.</p> <p>The latest disaster is Downing Street's mishandling of a windfall tax on energy companies. The idea was allowed to run until the last moment, suggesting \u00a31bn of unearned profits might be taken to ease the pain of the poorest. Downing Street started the talk of issuing energy vouchers to the needy, and only days ago denied the idea was dead. When Compass, the left-of-centre pressure group, gathered a great popular petition in support of it, endorsed by 122 MPs, several parliamentary private secretaries and, privately, many ministers, it looked like pushing at an open door. After all, Brown himself was the architect of that \u00a35bn windfall on the utilities.</p> <p>So it was a needless shock when the prime minister told the Scottish CBI that windfalls were \"short-term gimmicks and giveaways\". Instead, the energy companies will next week spend a lot less than that \u00a31bn on lagging lofts and insulating windows. Of course energy saving is essential - but it will get few of the vulnerable through this winter. As talks continue, the government now negotiates like a highwayman without a gun. What's to negotiate?</p> <p>It was not the left, but the Conservative-run Local Government Association that exposed the big six energy companies for giving shareholders a 20% dividend increase. Now there will be a stormy Labour conference as Compass and the unions prepare an emergency motion. The winter death figures will be watched by Brown's enemies: fairly or not, any extra old-and-cold deaths will be laid at his door.</p> <p>All this was so avoidable. In both the housing and fuel plans, no clear principle was spelled out. Brown should have said the government will not, and cannot, stop house prices falling. The stamp duty holiday is a bad mistake - all too characteristic of the prime minister. It's an expensive way to entice first-time buyers into negative equity, as all predictions are of steeper falls in house price. That money - maybe \u00a3600m - would be much better spent letting councils buy homes to keep a roof over the heads of families whose own homes have been repossessed - and buying cheap properties for social housing.</p> <p>But again, Brown yearns for that \"tax cut\" headline. Again he cuts a good tax on property as he did in income tax, while letting unfair purchase taxes hit the poorest hardest. A windfall tax was a chance not only to relieve the hard-pressed, but to signal some recompense for a decade of wealth trickling upwards.</p> <p>Charles Clarke's call for Brown's head was met by resounding silence this week, making it look less a clarion call than a lonely trumpeting of the Last Post. But it may come to be seen as the opening assassination salvo. The danger is it will be a painfully slow-motion stabbing, too late to make much difference.</p> <p>A cabinet of minnows and spineless backbenchers include many - perhaps most - who want Brown gone, but lack the nerve to act. They wait for someone else, for Brown to walk away or for a proverbial bus to save them from the task. First they put it off in July: wait until after the summer, many said. Now it's wait until the party conference - as if that \"speech of a lifetime\" could make a scrap of difference at this stage. Then it will be \"Don't rock the boat before the Glenrothes byelection\". Will that deliver the electric shock to end the inertia that neither Crewe nor Glasgow East could? Or will they put it off until after Christmas, or catastrophic May elections? Some say a recession is no time for internal wrangling; but the longer they leave it, the longer the leadership question hangs over them. It will not go away.</p> <p>Soon Cameron's lead will be gold-plated, his succession virtually inevitable. Another year effectively unchallenged by Labour, his contradictions and vacuities unridiculed and unexposed, will gift him an almost unopposed victory. Already at conferences the lobby groups and voluntary organisations hang on every word of shadow ministers, yawning through mere ministers on their way out. Already power, money, glamour, foreign interest and attention flock to Cameron in a political tide whose undertow knocks Labour off its feet with every wave.</p> <p>Stoking up fear of some fictitious Blairite coup is the Brown camp's trump card. They spook the unions with warnings that privatisers, tax-cutters and wealth-worshippers will take over if Brown is unseated. Personal rivalries - as between David Miliband and Ed Balls - are falsely dressed up as second-generation Brown/Blair battles. But this is all costume drama, wearing the political clothes of yesterday. The imaginary Blair/Brown ideological distinction has now been exposed as the sham it always was. Brown used to let it be known he opposed university fees, war, ID cards, Trident, foundation hospitals and a host of other things he now supports. The 10p tax band abolition to bribe the better off was a wickedness entirely of his own devising. Letting rip the disastrous house price boom was him, as was letting top earnings soar unchecked while reckless banks had \"light-touch regulation\" and public sector workers were pinned to below-inflation pay. The sad truth is that he opposed Blair, not Blair policies.</p> <p>So why would unions save his skin now? As the TUC gathers this weekend, they should consider that whoever was to stand as leader, they could win an election in the Labour party only with a radical new agenda. Unseating a prime minister is very high risk - but a dying party should be ready to take dangerous medicine if that's the last chance left.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Tom Stoppard believes he has cracked the old chestnut of whether Chekhov's plays are comedies. \"It suddenly became perfectly clear to me,\" he says, \"that you could answer with another question: 'Is life?' So it stops being a puzzle.\" In Chekhov, as in life, a \"production with no laughs\" would hardly be to Stoppard's taste. Chekhov \"liked laughter through unshed tears\".</p> <p>If Chekhov has long been a puzzle, so, in a sense, has Stoppard. In a 45-year career spanning stage, screen and radio, he is credited with bringing ideas back into British theatre. With Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966), first seen on the Edinburgh fringe, he became the youngest playwright to be staged by the National, and spawned a sub-genre of bit-players placed centre-stage. Later mixing historical and fictitious characters he still made riotously free with the English canon, from Hamlet to Agatha Christie. Even such a recent hit as the television serial Rome bows to Stoppard's attendant lords in its clueless centurion double act on the sidelines of imperial intrigue.</p> <p>Although Stoppard sees his plays as \"more unlike, than like, each other - they vary from farce to the sub-Shavian\", \"Stoppardian\" has become a trademark, not least for rapid-fire wit and bathetic juxtaposition, whether moral philosophy with gymnastics, as in Jumpers (1972), or the collision of Lenin, Joyce and Tristan Tzara with Wildean pastiche in Travesties (1974).</p> <p>The playwright has proved adept at knocking Hollywood blockbusters into shape, from Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985) and Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun (1987), to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and Michael Apted's Enigma (2001). The Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (1991) he directed in prewar Yugoslavia won the Golden Lion at Venice, while John Madden's seven-Oscar-winning Shakespeare in Love (1999), which he co-wrote, brought his unmistakable repartee to a new generation. Yet was he more than dazzlingly entertaining?</p> <p>Stoppard is a self-professed \"timid libertarian\" and his love of \"English landscape, English architecture, English character\" marked him down for some as a conservative. He accepted a knighthood in 1997, and the Order of Merit in 2000. Yet he has increasingly explored landscapes from his deeper past, in Indian Ink (1995) and his most recent play on Czechoslovakian and English freedoms, set between the Prague spring and the Velvet revolution, Rock'n'Roll (2006).</p> <p>A common carp used to be that his plays were all cleverness and no heart, until his critics were moved to tears by a young woman's impending death by fire in Arcadia (1993), and by the lament for a drowned child in his trilogy on 19th-century Russia, The Coast of Utopia (2002). For Michael Billington, \"although Stoppard was always prized for intellectual fireworks, wordplay and razzle-dazzle, what's interesting is the romanticism that lies beneath. The emotional content was either hidden or ignored.\" Ira Nadel, professor of English at the University of British Columbia and author of Double Act: A Life of Tom Stoppard (2002), views the comedy as a mask. \"His display of intellect masks the intensity of his feelings,\" he says. \"He's a very impersonal writer; his plays are not confessional - he doesn't use the stage as a diary.\" Yet, while he \"discards autobiography, he constantly explores identity\".</p> <p>Asked where he got his ideas from, Stoppard used to reply, \"Harrods\". Nadel thinks his fuel is history. Yet he seems inspired not so much by any period as by the clash and tension of abstract ideas. He prides himself on being able to argue all sides, leaving the audience to judge. Stoppard, who has written only one novel, Lord Malquist and Mr Moon (1966), quips that \"dialogue is the most respectable way of contradicting myself\". His imagination is drawn to situational paradox. Yet he waits for a spark. \"I'm so grateful to grab hold of something that wants to be a play,\" he says. \"It doesn't happen very often. I don't have unwritten plays waiting for their turn.\"</p> <p>At Chelsea harbour he gestures across the marina to his apartment of 20 years. Aged 71, and twice divorced (he separated from his second wife, Dr Miriam Stoppard, in 1990), he has four sons and seven grandchildren. The New York Times has described his accent as \"crisp\" and \"plummy\", bearing \"scant trace of his emigr\u00e9 status\". Yet despite his family's having fled Czechoslovakia when he was one and a half, a Mitteleuropean vestige does remain. His mother retained her Czech accent till her death in 1996, aged 85. He recently sold his house in Provence, having spent much of last year in New York. The Coast of Utopia won seven Tony awards, while Rock'n'Roll was a Broadway hit. His new version of Chekhov's first finished play, Ivanov (1887), with Kenneth Branagh in the lead role, previews from Friday as part of the Donmar West End season in London. His adaptation of The Cherry Orchard, for Sam Mendes, is to open in New York in January before touring to Britain. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, his 1977 play co-written with Andr\u00e9 Previn, is meanwhile being revived in January on the National Theatre's Olivier stage. About the plight of Soviet dissidents in psychiatric hospitals, it features a genuine lunatic who imagines a symphony orchestra in his cell.</p> <p>For Michael Grandage, artistic director of the Donmar, who directs Ivanov, the new adaptation \"invites us to share the humour of a man clearly suffering. It's comic writing on the edge.\" Stoppard, who worked with the Russian translator Helen Rappaport, says his versions of Chekhov, Schnitzler, Lorca, Pirandello or Jerome K Jerome have come about \"simply because I'm asked. If I'm not doing something of my own, I enjoy adapting.\" Although Chekhov was writing before the 1905 revolution, Stoppard resists the \"Chekhovian generality that here was a society heading for the precipice\". Nor does he hold with the view \"that the plays are about parasitic aristocrats with nothing to do except be victims of history. It doesn't stand up: they work hard.\" As for the comedy, \"Chekhov kept begging actors not to emote tragically - to keep things light and fast. He was trying to get actors to act against the emotion. So confusions have been inherited as to whether it was meant to be funny.\"</p> <p>The play poses another puzzle. Ivanov's wife is a Jewish convert, whom Ivanov at one point calls a \"silly yid\". \"The casual antisemitism of the period in Russia - and certainly Britain - is very discomforting,\" Stoppard says. \"Chekhov was capable of casually tossing off deplorable comments in his letters, combined with a very modern anger against antisemitism. It's as though the culture was in some kind of transition.\"</p> <p>Tom Stoppard was born Tomas Stra\u00fcssler in 1937, in Zlin, a Moravian town in Czechoslovakia that was the centre of an \"empire of shoes\". His father Eugen was a doctor for the Bata shoe manufacturers, and the family fled after the Nazi invasion of 1939, with other Jewish doctors working for Bata. They spent three years in Singapore, before the Japanese invasion forced his mother, Martha, to flee with \"Tommy\" and his elder brother Peter to British India. Their father was to follow, but his ship was sunk by Japanese bombers. \"Even now I don't know precisely how he died. The wives didn't find out anything till years later. I barely remembered my father; I'm confused between genuine memory and the few photographs that survived.\"</p> <p>India, which he sees as a \"lost domain of uninterrupted happiness\", was \"exciting and exotic - I felt protected\". The family moved around before settling in Darjeeling, where his mother managed the local Bata shoe shop. \"We weren't Raj because we were Czech refugees. What meant most to me was the physical India - chapatis cooking over a camel-dung fire. I haven't ever stopped dreaming about it.\"</p> <p>He later wrote Indian Ink for Felicity Kendal, with whom he had an eight-year relationship in the 1990s. The play staged a debate about empire, with a post-Forsterian take on relationships between Indians and Britons. Returning to India in his 40s, Stoppard says, \"I met elderly Indian people who had regret for the days of the Raj. So I've always been very divided about empire being a Bad Thing.\"</p> <p>After the war ended, his mother married Kenneth Stoppard, an army major. Early in 1946 they disembarked at Southampton into \"freezing cold. But we drove up to Nottingham, to my stepfather's family, and were warmly welcomed.\" Tom was eight. \"By that time, English was my only language. Suddenly I was an English schoolboy.\"</p> <p>His mother was a \"worrying mother, a very sweet woman who loved to read and made good jokes. She came out of a culture where women served men, and my stepfather came from a culture which agreed with that. He was an outdoor person. He read very little.\"</p> <p>Stoppard did A-levels at 17 and left school to be a journalist in Bristol. He relishes the \"pleasure of self-instruction\". As a second-string drama critic, he made friends at the Bristol Old Vic, then moved to London to write for radio and television before theatre. \"Everybody else was writing for the stage then, and I wanted to be a writer.\" It was a golden age, when \"theatre came into its majority, its glory\". According to Billington, \"English postwar drama had a resistance to intellectual concepts: you started with character, whereas Stoppard starts with an idea.\" Though he sees Stoppard's first hit as derivative - \"Waiting for Godot in Elizabethan costume\" - Billington acknowledges that at a time when theatre was too often associated with a muddy realism, Stoppard brought Technicolor, \"delighting in language and the illusions of theatre\".</p> <p>There are still, Stoppard believes, \"few things more uplifting than a great play or film - and few things more awful than a bad one\". For him, theatre is \"first and foremost a recreation. But it's not just a children's playground; it can be recreation for people who like to stretch their minds.\"</p> <p>He was in the early flush of success when Soviet tanks crushed the Prague spring. \"I remember the detachment I felt in 1968 from what was happening in Prague, when I'd been in England for 20 years,\" he says. But visiting Czechoslovakia in 1977 (\"to do my English bit for Charter 77\"), he became friends with playwright and future president V\u00e1clav Havel and other dissident writers. He also visited Soviet dissidents, including the Sakharovs, in Moscow. In The Coast of Utopia, when someone says of Ivan Turgenev's novels, \"so you don't take sides?\" the novelist responds, \"I take every possible side.\" For Stoppard, \"that was my at-rest mode for the first few years, mostly because I didn't know the answer to these conundrums. But in eastern Europe in the 70s and 80s, I did take sides. I wasn't up for any cause going; looking back, my focus was very narrow. I was interested in the shadow thrown by Soviet communism.\"</p> <p>His television play Professional Foul (1977) combined moral philosophy and football in communist Prague, Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth (1979) was inspired by the banned Czech playwright Pavel Kohout's abbreviated living-room Shakespeare, while the TV play Squaring the Circle (1984) tilted at General Jaruzelski's martial law in Poland.</p> <p>\"It was a relief to be able to participate in a case clear to me,\" Stoppard says. He was at odds with what he sees as the \"agitprop revolution\" of 1968 and British leftwing politics. \"I was impatient with the sloppy use of the language of human rights. I resented people here elevating themselves to the position occupied by people who really had to worry about being jailed for what they wrote.\"</p> <p>Night and Day (1978), on the ethics of journalism, skewered the closed shop. Describing himself as \"gung-ho for Wapping\", Stoppard later praised Margaret Thatcher for crushing the print unions. Yet, as he told the British Journalism Review in 2005, his zeal then for an untrammelled press had mattered more to him than her \"philistinism\". Recalling his past objections to the equating of media ownership by tycoons with censorship, he says: \"Now I'd be capable of writing a letter in reply to myself . . . Look at Berlusconi and Putin - it's complete manipulation and control.\"</p> <p>After The Real Thing (1982) - for Billington, \"one of the most painful plays about the agony of infidelity written since the war\" - his work became even more of an intellectual stretch. In Hapgood (1988), he combined quantum mechanics with cold-war spying, and in Arcadia, chaos theory with Byron and 18th-century landscape gardening. He says he reads popular science \"for pleasure, not research - and not for the prose. I do try to be as accurate as I can.\" Yet he can also be \"completely cavalier: if I discover something didn't really happen, I say the whole thing's made up, a parallel world.\"</p> <p>The Coast of Utopia, set mainly before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, depicts Russian intellectuals washed up as refugees in England after the 1848 revolutions across Europe, divided between revolution and peaceful change. Again, it was paradox, not period, that drew him in. \"I was interested by the idea that artists working in a totalitarian dictatorship or tsarist autocracy are secretly and slightly shamefully envied by artists who work in freedom. They have the gratification of intense interest: the authorities want to put them in jail, while there are younger readers for whom what they write is pure oxygen.\"</p> <p>He found a personal hero in the early socialist Alexander Herzen, who in the play says: \"Until we stop killing our way towards [Utopia], we won't be grown up as human beings.\" \"That certainly struck home with me,\" Stoppard says. \"The notion that the 'leader' has the right to ask huge sacrifices of your generation for a notional future paradise - if you'd be good enough to lie down under the wheels of the juggernaut - that sentimental and self-aggrandising rationalisation for brute force and cowardice I felt from adolescence was wrong.\" He adds, \"One senses that all the Bolsheviks, even those who ended up as cold-blooded autocrats, had been on a journey from idealism to something else, and didn't notice - to mix periods - when the Rubicon was crossed.\"</p> <p>He identifies, too, with Turgenev, who said, \"I'm not pure spirit, but I'm not society's keeper either.\" \"Alas, yes, that's my temperament,\" Stoppard says. \"I felt close to his character when I was writing the play in ways which made me feel better - and worse - about myself. He had a terror of violence, and didn't consider himself to be a revolutionary, but in the movement of history, he knew which way he wanted the river to go.\"</p> <p>Rock'n'Roll drew on fierce political arguments among Czech intellectuals, yet also contains a lament for the erosion of freedoms in Britain's own \"democracy of obedience\". Jan, the Czech anglophile who returns to Prague after the Soviet invasion, is a shadow self, a character from a possible \"autobiography in a parallel world where I returned 'home' after the war\". Stoppard was surprised to find love taking over the plot. \"When the love story came together,\" he says, \"the play was over - it was no longer interesting.\"</p> <p>On whether there is more emotional heart in his later work, Stoppard says: \"I recognise some truth in that. It indicates some loss of self-protectiveness - a shyness in my 20s and 30s. You can't but know that if you can capture the emotions of the audience as well as their minds, the play will work better, because it's a narrative art form.\" His stance towards his past may also have shifted. Only in the early 1990s, after \"the communists fell and the blind went up\" did Stoppard learn from distant Czech relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish and had died in Terezin, Auschwitz and other camps, along with three of his mother's sisters. After his parents' deaths, he returned with his elder brother to Zlin in 1998, for the first time in almost 60 years. Writing in Talk magazine in 1999, he expressed grief both for a lost father and a missing past. But he has no sense of being a survivor, at whatever remove. \"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life.\"</p> <p>The Talk article was scathing about his late stepfather, who believed that \"to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life\", telling his small stepson: \"Don't you realise that I made you British?\" Days after his wife died, he wrote to his stepson asking him to stop using the Stoppard name, concerned about his \"tribalisation\" - his championing of Soviet Jews. Stoppard replied that it would not be \"practical\". He now says he regrets revealing that episode. \"It was too personal. The poor man had lost his wife and was upset.\"</p> <p>Stoppard remains close to his four sons: Oliver, a Norfolk postman; Barnaby, who owns a gourmet fast-food outlet; William, who manages his wife, rock violinist Linzi Stoppard; and Ed, an actor. \"I worry about them all,\" he says. \"Some parents take it as an axiom that their child will be the best pianist or cook. To my discredit, I'm sceptical.\" Yet when Ed Stoppard played Hamlet, \"it completely thrilled me - it was so intelligently spoken\".</p> <p>He once wrote ironically of his childhood self, that he was \"coming on well as an honorary Englishman\". The world may be more open now to layered identities, but his unease remains. \"I fairly often find I'm with people who forget I don't quite belong in the world we're in,\" he says. \"I find I put a foot wrong - it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history - and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket.\" His characters, he notes, are \"constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails to do with the confusion of having two names\".</p> <p>Resistant to self-analysis, Stoppard alights on a paradox. \"A writer ought to be the best possible source about their work,\" he says, \"but the writing instinct doesn't come out of self-examination. That part of yourself in your work is expressed willy-nilly, without your cooperation, motivation or collusion. You can't help being what you write and writing what you are.\"</p> <h2>Stoppard on Stoppard</h2> <p>\"BIRDBOOT: It's Higgs.\"</p> <p>This otherwise unexceptional line still brings back one of those moments when you wanted to get up from your desk and shout \"Hallelujah!\"</p> <p>Birdboot is a character in The Real Inspector Hound. Higgs is a corpse, an unidentified body in and out of view from the beginning of the murder mystery play which Birdboot, a theatre critic, has been attending. There comes the moment when Birdboot, finding himself enmeshed in the mystery, turns the body over and recognises it. It's Higgs! Hallelujah! The perfect solution to the mystery which had been worrying me since I'd begun writing the play: who was the body?</p> <p>After 40 years, the problem remains, each time. You can't start writing until you know what you're doing, and you don't know what you're doing until you start writing. I still have to resist the false intuition that I need to know as much as possible in advance. The essential thing is to know as little as possible. Ideally, when things fall out well, you shouldn't feel clever, you should feel lucky.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Quote from The Real Inspector Hound, published by Avalon</p>",
  "<h2>Braid, Xbox 360</h2> <p>Braid looks like a moving oil painting and appears initially to conform to every platform game standard in existence, from killing enemies by hopping on their heads to collecting stuff - in this case, jigsaw pieces. However, beneath its unusual looks and seemingly pedestrian mechanics, beats a heart of pure invention: unlike other platform games, you can rewind time whenever you like for as long as you like. Rather than removing the game's difficulty, this instead opens up a world of exquisitely designed logic puzzles, getting you to thread your way through increasingly ingenious levels in search of those elusive Eureka moments. It's a masterpiece, from its painterly art style to the folk music that perfectly warps and distorts itself around the time-bending action, to the story, which is so oblique and symbolic you're aware that hero Tim's quest to save a princess may actually be a psychotic delusion, let alone trying to decode references to the Manhattan Project. Braid is a beautiful game. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Microsoft, approx \u00a310.20 from Xbox Live Arcade</p> <h2>Mercenaries 2: World In Flames, PC/PS2/PS3/Xbox 360 (reviewed)</h2> <p>As the antithesis of the thoughtful creativity of Braid, Mercenaries 2 is a game about, in the words of developer Pandemic, \"blowing shit up\". This means choosing one of three standard-issue action game drones before heading out into the jungles of Venezuela and setting about the troops, buildings and vehicles with an endless supply of small arms, helicopters, tanks and air strikes. Everything is combustible or at least destructible and, while it's nice to be able to bulldoze trees in a tank rather than get stuck behind them, most explosions look flimsily pumped-up, with buildings resembling plywood structures stuffed with explosives. Primitive, largely texture- free graphics match clumsy implementation, with third-person aiming obscured by scenery and your character. A hollow experience.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Electronic Arts, \u00a329.99-\u00a349.99</p> <h2>Pleo, Robotic dinosaur</h2> <p>Pleo bills itself as manufacturer UGOBE's first artificial life form, a rubbery-skinned baby dinosaur that responds to sounds, surroundings and petting rather than anything as mundane as a remote control.

  "<p>There is a striking similarity between Barack Obama and his new nemesis, Sarah Palin - and it's not just that they are both big on basketball. They have equally set out on what Obama likes to call an \"improbable journey\" that will see one of them make it all the way to the White House on November 4.</p> <p>In Palin's case, the improbable journey began here: a sprawling wooden compound that looks like a cross between an oversized McDonald's and a prison complex. It occupies a patch of barren ground on the edge of Wasilla, the tiny town in Alaska in which she spent her childhood and cut her political teeth. Above the entrance a banner announces that this is the home of the Wasilla Assembly of God, motto: \"To know Him, and to make Him known!\"</p> <p>It was here Palin was baptised, or \"saved\", as she describes it, and later had her children baptised. It was here she was inducted into the peculiar rituals of her fundamentalist faith - the charismatic preaching, the laying on of hands, the tears and cries of joy of the Pentecostal church. \"I grew up in the Wasilla Assembly of God,\" she once said. \"Nothing freaks me out about the worship service.\"</p> <p>On the night I visit the church, the congregation is huddled in a group, arms raised or clasped around each other, as the senior pastor, Ed Kalnins, leads them in prayer. \"Lord, we know that you have made this church a platform,\" he exclaims. \"You are using the wonderful Governor Palin to get your message of the gospel across.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed, as his flock calls him, moved to Wasilla in 1999 - three years after the town elected Palin as its mayor. What struck him the first time they met, he has said, was that in her eyes religion came first, politics second. He thought to himself: \"This person loves Jesus. That's the bottom line. She loves Jesus with everything she has. She is a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she is the mayor. Sarah Palin is the real deal.\"</p> <p>Pastor Ed's language may be colourful. But he has put his finger on a central truth about the woman who in two months' time could become the next vice-president of the US. From her earliest days at the bottom of the political ladder in minuscule Wasilla, through to her sudden rise this week into international stardom, she has always been on a mission.</p> <p>Her trajectory has run in parallel with that of her party. Her career took off precisely at the moment when the Christian right seized control of the Republican movement, casting out the fiscal conservatives who had traditionally held sway with their focus on such worldly matters as low taxes and small government.</p> <p>The shift in the party's focus from mammon to God is illustrated perfectly in Palin's successful campaign to become mayor in 1996. All previous elections had revolved around such existential questions as how to improve the pavements and get litter off the streets. She ignored all that, campaigning instead against abortion and gun control and casting aspersions on her (Republican) opponent about his infrequent attendance of church.</p> <p>Victoria Naegele was editor of the local paper, The Frontiersman, at the time and can recall the shock of the Palin revolution. \"I remember thinking 'Wow! Are religious issues really germane to the job of being mayor of a town of just 5,000 people?'\"</p> <p>Naegele remembers vividly too a second shockwave that came swiftly after Palin's election. Instead of easing her way into the role, she went in with guns blazing, demanding that six of the department heads of the council - none of them political appointments, several with many years' service - submit their resignations. When Naegele protested through the editorial columns of the paper at what she saw as the new mayor's heavy-handed style, she felt the heat. \"It was a difficult time. I was lambasted as a liberal, when in fact I am a Christian conservative Republican, just like Sarah Palin.\"</p> <p>Then, in an incident that is fast turning into the stuff of political legend, Palin was revealed earlier this week to have attempted to censor Wasilla's library. The idea is almost laughable when you see the library itself. Its small collection of books includes a prominent section on hunting and fishing, and no visible copies of Lady Chatterley's Lover. Yet in 1996, after parents complained about a book their child had taken home, Palin took umbrage. Frustratingly, no one can remember the volume concerned. What we do know is that Palin turned on the then librarian, Mary Ellen Emmons, asking her in a council meeting what she would do if she were told by the mayor to remove certain books from the collection.</p> <p>Local resident Anne Kilkenny was in the public gallery and heard the librarian's reaction: \"She sucked in her breath, and replied that the books in the library were all acquired in accordance with professional criteria and she would resist completely.\"</p> <p>Palin has since claimed her question was purely rhetorical. That is not how Naegele and Kilkenny perceived it at the time. A few weeks later, Palin sent Emmons a letter terminating her employment. \"People in the town rose up in anger,\" Kilkenny recalls. \"The library is an important institution in our city, as there's not a lot else to do here in the winter but sit by the fire with a good book. There was real public pressure, and Sarah was forced to rescind the letter.\"</p> <p>Emmons survived. Others were less fortunate. The museum director, city planner and public works director all quit within months of Palin's ascendancy, and the police chief was sacked outright (he sued for wrongful dismissal but lost). Palin said the turnover was needed to clean out the \"old boys' club\". Others were not so sure.</p> <p>Again, she was utterly in tune with the trajectory of her party. By the end of the 1990s the Republican leadership had adopted a modus operandi that also combined religious zealotry with managerial ruthlessness. Yet this development was not without its detractors within the party. One of the loudest critics was the very man who has put Palin on the national stage: John McCain. Paradoxically, it was partly his disdain for the grip that TV preachers came to hold over the Republicans that earned him a reputation as a maverick.</p> <p>Since then, Palin has travelled a huge distance in her journey towards the White House. Two years ago she became Alaska's first female governor, with some of the most valuable natural resources in the US under her control. Stylistically, she's become much more sophisticated. But under the surface, the way of operating has changed little.</p> <p>The religious mission is still front and centre of her politics. She opposes abortion in all cases other than those in which the mother would die if she were to give birth. She is a vocal opponent of gay marriage, and advocate of the teaching of anti-evolutionary creationism, or \"intelligent design\", in schools.</p> <p>Her religious beliefs extend to a conviction that the Iraq war is God's will. When she returned to Wasilla in June to pray with her old congregation, she said of the troops being posted to Iraq, including her own son, Track: \"Our national leaders are sending them out on a task from God. We have to pray there is a plan and that it's God's plan.\"</p> <p>Most poignantly, she will not countenance sex education for teenagers, preferring instead to preach that abstinence is the only complete protection against pregnancy or venereal disease. It would be a cheap shot to suggest that this week's bombshell revelation that her 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is herself pregnant was Palin's comeuppance.</p> <p>But it would not be unfair to point out that Alaska has the highest per capita incidence of chlamydia in the country, and that the rate of teenage pregnancies across the US, including within her state, has just risen for the first time in 14 years - a trend many blame on George Bush's preferment of abstinence-only education. \"It's frustrating we aren't doing more to inform our children,\" said Brittany Goodnight of the Alaska branch of Planned Parenthood.</p> <p>If the religious flame still burns bright, so too does the ruthless determination. In an echo of what happened to the librarian and police chief in Wasilla all those years ago, Palin is embroiled in a full-scale investigation by the Alaskan state legislature into allegations that she sacked the safety commissioner because he in turn refused to act against a police officer whom Palin wanted dismissed. </p> <p>The officer, Mike Wooten, was the governor's former brother-in-law, who had been through an acrimonious divorce from her sister. Palin, her husband, Todd, and several of her aides tried to convince the commissioner, Walter Monegan, to fire Wooten, but he refused.</p> <p>The casualties scattered along Palin's path continue to mount. Lyda Green, a neighbour of Palin's in Wasilla, has just become the latest. She is stepping down as a state senator after 14 years.</p> <p>Green is the leader of the Republicans in the Alaskan senate and an old-style fiscal conservative. She voted against several of the governor's most important initiatives over the past two years, including a move to increase taxes on the big oil and gas companies. Green was surprised by the reprisals that followed. \"I found early on that if you disagreed with her it was not taken as a disagreement with policy, but a personal disagreement.\"</p> <p>First came the embarrassment of a radio interview between Palin and a local rightwing shock-jock in which the interviewer called Green a bitch and a cancer within the party. Palin's response on air? She laughed.</p> <p>\"She knew I'm a cancer survivor - she sent me flowers,\" Green says. \"That was a very lacklustre moment.\"</p> <p>Then Palin arranged for a friend to stand this summer against Green in the Republican party's selection process for her own senate seat. Green decided to stand down rather than go through a primary battle she was sure would be ugly. \"There came a point when I thought it was no longer worth it,\" says Green. \"I didn't need, in a community as small as this, to stand in the face of this very popular governor.\" Then she adds: \"But it's not a way to run a government.\"</p> <p>That's a pertinent observation, I suggest, in the light of the next destination Sarah Palin hopes to reach in her improbable journey. \"It is pertinent,\" Green replies.</p> <h2>Putin v Palin: who would win in a shoot-out?</h2> <p>American politicians have a long tradition of talking up their expertise with firearms. Most recently, then-hopeful presidential candidate Mitt Romney was caught boasting he'd \"been a hunter pretty much all my life\" - by which, it turned out, he meant he'd been rabbit shooting twice. But Sarah Palin's claim seems far more justifiable: a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, she's been caribou hunting on numerous occasions, and footage exists of her firing an A4 assault rifle in Kuwait. She has also taken a close personal interest in \"aerial wolf gunning\", an Alaskan practice that involves exactly what you'd imagine.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's recent tiger-tranquillising triumph, on the other hand, raises numerous questions. It wasn't caught on camera, even though he was with a TV crew, whose lives he reportedly saved, and footage that was released showed another member of the crew explaining how to hold the weapon. Firing a tranquilliser dart is easier, too: there's less kickback. Putin has been photographed brandishing a rifle in the past, but actual instances of shooting seem curiously absent.</p> <p>Gun enthusiasts swooned over Palin in the US, though some noted the rifle in the Kuwait video appears to be a modified one, equipped with a laser; you can't see the targets, but it's likely she was shooting at a simulator screen. Still, as one of the soldiers can be heard to observe, she's apparently \"hitting pretty close to dead centre\". </p> <p>This may not be the most persuasive foreign policy qualification in presidential history, but if Palin had to face Putin in a shoot-out on an ice floe in the Bering Strait, it seems likely she'd win. Unless Dick Cheney was hunting in the vicinity, of course, in which case he'd probably accidentally kill them both.</p>",
  "<p>A British student who was injured after falling off a horse in a remote part of Russia was rescued yesterday after sending a distress signal which was picked up 3,700 miles away by an RAF base in Scotland. </p> <p>Kimberley Warren, a second year zoology student at Nottingham University, activated a rescue beacon on Thursday night which was detected by satellites monitored by the UK Mission Control Centre, based within the Aeronautical Rescue Coordination Centre at RAF Kinloss in Moray.</p> <p>The beacon used GPS technology, which gives a very accurate position within five seconds of being activated, allowing RAF Kinloss to raise the alarm and tell Russian emergency services where to find the party of nine. </p> <p>\"They were able to pinpoint the location of the group right down to an area smaller than half a tennis court,\" said Michael Mulford, from RAF Kinloss, who added that it was \"very unusual\" for the base to respond to signals so far away.</p> <p>After a 12-hour helicopter rescue operation Warren, who had broken her leg, was airlifted to a nearby town with the rest of the group.</p> <p>The 20-year-old student from Sway, Hampshire, was nearing the end of a two-and-a-half month trip to research the effects of global warming on natural habitats in Kamchatka nature park, which is situated in a remote part of far eastern Russia, when the accident happened. </p> <p>Kamchatka is one of the world's last great wildernesses, home to the rare Steller's sea eagle, puffins, and brown bears, who roam around its geysers and snow-covered calderas - the term for a collapsed volcano. </p> <p>Kamchatka boasts more than 300 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. During Soviet times Kamchatka was a strategic military base, off limits to foreigners. But since the collapse of communism the 750-mile long peninsula has attracted conservationists and scientists - in addition to well-heeled foreign tourists, most of them German but including a few Britons.</p> <p>Russian officials said the rescue operation was hampered by bad weather. There are few roads outside Kamchatka's fog-covered capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatky - with helicopters the only way of reaching most of the peninsula's central wilderness areas and national parks. Liz Warren, Kimberley's mother, said yesterday: \"Kimberley has had a fabulous time on this trip. From her emails we know it's been hard work, the field work has been tough, but she's loved every minute. As parents all we want to do is get her home and give her a big hug.\"</p> <p>Mulford said RAF Kinloss played a part in a distant rescue operation in December 2003 when Jennifer Murray, 63, from Somerset, and Colin Bodill, 54, from Nottingham, crashed in a helicopter in the Antarctic while attempting a round-the-world record via both poles. RAF Kinloss raised the alarm after picking up the signal from the helicopter's distress beacon.</p>",
  "<h2>The vineyard</h2> <p>Vineyards are complex and demanding creatures. Like us, every vineyard has its own distinct personality or DNA - known in the wine world as<strong> terroir</strong> (te-wah). A French term with no straightforward English translation, terroir is used to describe the combination of environmental and physical factors that affect a vineyard, including the location, the climate and the type of soil. Together, these play a huge role in determining how a vineyard's grapes will both fare and taste. It's because of the complexity of each of these factors, and the many possible combinations they present, that no two vineyards are ever exactly the same.</p> <h2>The basic ingredients</h2> <p><strong>Grapes. </strong>These are, of course, the star ingredient. The species of vine grown for wine production is vitis vinifera, and the number of varieties within that family runs well into the thousands (these guides focus on the most popular reds and whites). Wine grapes, as opposed to the ones you eat on the sly in the supermarket, tend to be smaller, have thicker skins and contain pips. Grapes love sunshine, but not too much; they like it hot, but not too hot; they love to get wet, but not too wet; they love bad soil; and they love to get high - altitude, that is.</p> <p><strong>Climate.</strong> The climate in which grapes grow has a dramatic influence not only on taste, but on how long a wine will last. As a rule, wine produced from grapes grown in the northern hemisphere - in cooler climates - will be higher in natural acidity and lower in alcohol than those produced south of the equator, where the exact opposite (lower acid, higher alcohol) applies. </p> <p><strong>Soil.</strong> From chalk to clay to limestone to granite - even volcanic ash - soil plays a huge role in the health of vines and, to some extent, the final taste of your wine. Some soils drain water better than others, while some are naturally richer in nutrients and minerals than others. This will determine things such as how much water the vines will get, their ability to retain heat, flavour, texture, and even how they will defend themselves against disease. </p> <p><strong>Water.</strong> Vines need water in the same way that any plant does, but they naturally like to be stressed. Too much water and the vines will be so spoilt they won't work hard enough to produce good-quality fruit.</p> <p><strong>The X factor.</strong> The unpredictable force in agriculture is mother nature and, as any farmer knows, she can be as cruel as she can be kind. A different set of climatic conditions from one year to the next means that a wine will also be different, if only slightly, from one year to the next. Despite all the innovation, all the advances and all the technology we've employed to date, this is still an industry very much at the mercy of the elements. </p> <h2>Methods</h2> <p>Growing grapes requires other important considerations beyond climate, soil and water: eg the distance between each vine, how to train them, and how to protect them against disease. </p> <p><strong>Conventional viticulture</strong> is the most common and most commercial method, in which growers use what they like (within reason), chemical or otherwise, to ensure they get the best possible end result.</p> <p><strong>Organics</strong> are an increasingly popular choice, not only with consumers but also with grape growers who want to get the utmost quality from their vines. Organic wines are those produced from grapes grown without the use of industrial fertilisers, herbicides, fungicides and pesticides, <br>and excluding the addition of synthetic additives. </p> <p><strong>Biodynamic</strong> viticulture, on the other hand, is an extension of biodynamic farming - the brainchild of Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner. Biodynamic agriculture takes basic organics and adds elements of homeopathy, astronomy and astrology. Rather than simply focusing on how to coax the best out of the vines, biodynamics treats the entire vineyard as a single living organism which, with the application of various preparations or manures, operates in line with lunar and cosmic rhythms.</p> <p>There are many producers who have long practised organic or biodynamic viticulture, but who pull up short of certification in order to have the luxury of being able to intervene should things go horribly pear-shaped. </p> <h2>The winery</h2> <p>Converting grape juice into wine is a relatively simple process; making really great wine is far more involved. As with chefs, some winemakers like to use everything but the kitchen sink during production, while others adopt a more hands-off approach, allowing the fruit to speak for itself. </p> <h2>So how is wine made?</h2> <p>The number of directions the winemaker can take are endless, depending on the colour and style of wine to be made. <strong>Fermentation</strong> is the one factor common to all wine. </p> <p>To kick-start fermentation, cultured yeast can be added to the grape juice, or the winemaker can wait for wild yeasts - which naturally develop and live in the winery - to introduce themselves to the grape juice, at which point they become active, munching their way through the natural sugar, converting it into alcohol as they go. Wild yeasts can be tricky to control, but the range of aroma and flavour they can bring to a finished wine can be well worth the risk. </p> <h2>How to make white wine</h2> <p>White grapes are nearly always <strong>crushed</strong> and <strong>de-stemmed</strong> first. With any unwanted items such as leaves and stems removed, the crushed grapes are then transferred to a press, where they are gently squeezed to separate the juice from the skins and pips. The reason for taking away the skins, stems and pips is that they contain bitter and astringent tannins, which are OK in reds but pretty undesirable in whites. </p> <p><strong>Sulphur dioxide</strong> will also more than likely be added to stop fermentation kicking off and the wine changing colour and flavour prematurely. The juice will then be \"settled\" in a tank before fermentation. Fermentation for white wine can take anywhere from three to 30 days, and is more often carried out at cool temperatures to preserve freshness of aroma and flavour. </p> <p>After fermentation, unwooded whites can be bottled pretty much straight away, making them relatively cheap to produce and therefore also to buy. Some wooded wines are fermented from start to finish in oak, a process known as <strong>barrel fermentation</strong>. Others go through their primary fermentation in stainless-steel tanks before being transferred to oak barrels either to finish fermenting or for ageing. At this point, the wine can go through a secondary fermentation known as <strong>malolactic fermentation</strong> (try saying that quickly after a few glasses of wine). MLF is the process whereby the malic acid in wine (think tart granny smith apples) is transformed into lactic acid (think milk). This is used widely for red wines, but for whites it is usually only employed for such varieties as chardonnay and semillon, softening undrinkably high acidity and producing smells of butterscotch and cream. Wooded whites can spend any time between six and 12 months soaking in oak before being transferred to a tank for filtration and fining.</p> <p><strong>Filtration</strong> and <strong>fining</strong> are like giving the wine a good spit and polish. Filtration machines and special additives (from the traditional egg white to modern chemicals) are used to help get rid of any particles left in the wine. Some winemakers shy away from this stage, believing it will strip the wine of characters developed during the winemaking process. Fined or not, the wine is then bottled and sealed, ready for sale and, more importantly, ready to drink.</p> <h2>How to make red wine</h2> <p>The main difference in red wine production is the addition of the <strong>skins</strong> (and sometimes stems, too). Squeeze a red grape <br>between your fingers and you'll discover that the juice is clear, as with a white grape. It is the skins that provide red wine with colour, structure, texture and flavour. The cocktail of grape skins and juice is transferred, after crushing, to open-topped tanks, which can be made of wood, stainless steel or concrete. Once fermentation begins, the build-up of carbon dioxide (a byproduct of fermentation) will push the skins (known as the <strong>cap</strong>) to the top of the tank. But to extract the colour and flavours locked in the skins, they need to be continually mixed back into the juice. </p> <p>Back in the good old days, workers would hop nude into the tanks and push the cap down with their legs. Not only was this process physically exhausting, it was potentially fatal - not from the risk of drowning, but because of the high levels of carbon dioxide given off during fermentation. Regulations have, in effect, outlawed this method. Less hazardous methods include <strong>pigeage</strong> (\"pee-garge\"), the French term for using a long broom-like device to manually push the skins back down into the juice. <strong>Pumping over</strong> is a far more common (and easier) method, and modern technology has meant that much of this process has now been automated. </p> <p>Whichever method is used, the process is usually carried out several times a day, depending on the amount of extraction the winemaker wants, and is continued until primary fermentation has finished.</p> <p>What's left in the bottom of the fermentation tank (whole grapes, skins and pips) will be separately transferred back to the press to wring out any remaining juice. This extracted juice will be super-rich in colour and tannin, and can be used as a blending component. Most red wines, with a handful of exceptions, spend any time from six months to two years in oak barrels of varying age, make and size. </p> <p><strong>What about ros\u00e9?</strong></p> <p>With a foot in each camp, ros\u00e9 is a red wine that is made like an unwooded white. And although there is a number of different ways you can go about it, the most common method of producing ros\u00e9 is simply to leave the skins in contact with the juice for a short period of time - perhaps only a matter of hours - allowing a small amount of colour extraction (pink!), together with the faintest lick of tannin. </p> <h2>How to make sparkling </h2> <p>Sparkling is any wine that is saturated with carbon dioxide (bubbles) under pressure (a bottle). The cheapest method of getting bubbles into the bottle is <strong>carbonation</strong> (think Sodastream). The <strong>transfer method </strong>is used to produce large volumes of low- to medium-priced sparkling wine. Yeast is added to a sweetened base wine and a second fermentation takes place in an enclosed tank, so that the carbon dioxide can't escape. When the fermentation is finished, the wine is clarified, re-sweetened or blended if necessary, then bottled (again under pressure to retain the gas). </p> <p>The <strong>methode traditionelle </strong>(called methode champenoise in Champagne) generally produces the best-quality wines. Here a second fermentation is allowed to take place in the bottle, with the resulting carbon dioxide trapped underneath the seal. The dead yeast cells form a deposit in the bottom of the bottle, and need to be removed to get the champagne looking its best for sale. This is achieved by riddling, or remuage, where the bottles are placed horizontally in wooden racks and each day are turned an eighth and tilted until vertically positioned upside down. The unwanted sediment is trapped in the neck of the bottles. The necks, and their contents, are then frozen by dipping them into a very cold brine solution. Disgorgement (not a form of gruesome medieval torture) is next. The seals on the bottles are removed and the pressure of the built-up gas forces the frozen sediment out. The bottles are topped up with a sugary wine (liqueur d'expedition), to offset the high acidity of the base wine, and corks are inserted and wired. The wine is then rested for a further period before it is finally ready for sale.</p> <h2>How to make sweet wine</h2> <p>The number of ways to produce sweet wine is dizzying. To make the most famous sweet wines, such as Sauternes from Bordeaux, the grapes are picked late, when overripe and, ideally, shrivelled by <strong>botrytis cinerea</strong>, a beneficial mould that reduces the grapes' water content and concentrates their sweetness (known as <strong>noble rot</strong>).</p> <p>To make fortified wines, such as port and sherry, the fermentation is prevented from finishing by the addition of brandy spirit, which increases the alcoholic strength up to around 18 degrees. This level of alcohol kills the fermenting yeasts and the result is a super-sweet wine with a super-high alcohol content. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Matt Skinner's Thirsty Work is published by Mitchell Beazley (\u00a317.99)</p>",
  "<p>If malbec sounds a less familiar grape, it may be because it is known as many other things - to name just a few, c\u00f4t in much of south-west France and the Loire, pressac in parts of Bordeaux, auxerrois in Cahors, where it is the main grape variety, and occasionally malbeck in Argentina, where it dominates red wine production. The vine is quite fragile in cooler climates, where the wine can taste rather rustically gamey. Delicate winemaking can give a delicate, almost Burgundian finish to more elegant malbecs, but it more often receives heavy oaking. </p> <p><strong>Argentina</strong></p> <p>The Argentinians have given malbec a new lease of life, turning this rather overlooked grape into a national hero. In the finest Mendoza vineyards, as in the best of Cahors, the grape can produce deep-coloured, velvety, intensely ripe and attractively gamey wines that are well worth ageing. You will find 100% malbec wines from Argentina, but also blends, often with a little cabernet sauvignon.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Malbec is one of the six grapes allowed in the wines of Bordeaux, where it is still grown mainly on the hillsides of Bourg and Blaye. Over the past half-century, however, it has fallen out of favour, regarded by some as a poor man's merlot. These days, it is primarily used in the \"black wine\" of Cahors. The appellation rules stipulate that Cahors must be at least 70% malbec, blended with the tannic tannat and/or merlot. Cahors is exceptional among the important south-west French appellations in that neither cabernet grape (sauvignon or franc) is allowed.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>The appeal and commercial success of malbec from Argentina is increasing its popularity elsewhere, such as Chile, Australia, California and north-east Italy. It is often used in Bordeaux-style blends to add colour and tannins.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Anubis Malbec 2006, Argentina</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.19, Tesco</strong></p> <p>Most wines at this price achieve drinkability by going all out for fruity impact, the vinous equivalent of dancing the can-can in a pair of pink frilly knickers.

  "<p>Touriga nacional is vigorous and robust, but it produces notoriously low yields and small grapes. This has made it unpopular with growers, and nearly led to its extinction in the mid-20th century. Since then, however, much effort has been spent on clonal selection of the variety so that newer cuttings are slightly more productive and sugar levels even higher. </p> <p>Port is made from a blend of grapes - more than 80 varieties are planted in almost 100,000 acres in Portugal - but touriga nacional stands as the most famous and revered.</p> <p><strong>Portugal</strong></p> <p>As well as making port, touriga nacional is now also grown to produce extremely concentrated, dark, tannic table wines both in the Douro Valley and elsewhere in Portugal, notably D\u00e3o. In the same way that cabernet sauvignon is softened by blending with another grape, touriga can be partnered with local versions of tempranillo. </p> <p>Another grape classified as one of the best port varieties is touriga franca (which, despite the name, has no proven connection with France). Favoured for its consistent yields, it is the most widely planted grape in the Douro Valley and grown in considerably bigger quantities than touriga nacional (four times the plantings), though it does produce less concentrated wines. These two tourigas work well together - a bit like cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc. </p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Touriga nacional is also grown in Australia and is increasingly being planted elsewhere, notably in Spain.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>TNAC 2005 D\u00e3o, Portugal</strong><br><strong>\u00a310.50, Armit (<a href=\"http://www.armit.co.uk\">armit.co.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>Touriga nacional may be known for the port it makes in the Douro, but some of its best dry reds, like this one, actually come from D\u00e3o, further south.

Good wine and cheese matches aren't as difficult as you might imagine, largely because you are combining two finished products. First consider texture - light and delicate, soft and creamy, hard and dry, heavy and intense. Balancing the weights of your wine and cheese as evenly as possible is step one. Also consider flavour - generally, the more flavour you have in your cheese, the more flavour you'll need in your wine.</p> <p>Acidity is important, too. It's no great coincidence that high-acid cheeses, such as fresh goat's cheese, work beautifully with high-acid wines such as young sauvignon blanc. And finally, consider mould - it can often make dry wines seem fruitless and bitter.

  "<p>This is going to be fun - a Peugeot 308 SW Sport, with a free tank of petrol. What could be better? Living above a garage, I'd initially thought about asking the mechanics to strip it down for the most extensive car review in newspaper history, but having set eyes on the Babylon-red beauty with the leer of a lascivious Space Hopper, I think I'll take her somewhere nice. This turns out to be Mum's - and it's pouring.</p> <p>Having managed to switch off the alarm, I am faced with some very advanced-looking kit. There's satnav, which I've never used before; ESP - am I supposed to sense what this is? And an on-board computer to tell you when it's got a pain in the plugs. Before I'm out of the drive, it informs me I've sent a distress message to Peugeot - I'd better get out of here before the cavalry arrives. </p> <p>It's reassuringly straightforward to drive, with all the basic controls where you'd expect - not something you could always take for granted with French cars - and it feels surprisingly solid compared with the Peugeots of my youth. The interior is luxurious, fitted with sumptuous seats, a JBL hi-fi and leather steering wheel. Should the worst happen, it becomes a bouncy castle on wheels with seven air bags. Perhaps to cover my carbon-emitting, one-man-in-a-car shame, I should inflate them and draw faces to look like a family.</p> <p>The speedometer does not have 40mph on its dial, which is a bugger with all the cameras. Did I mention the six gears? On the M4, I test for grunt and, yes, there is plenty. </p> <p>Mother is impressed, and takes photographs. It seems to represent an upturn in family fortunes, even though it's going back next week.</p> <p>Around the twisting lanes of west Berkshire, it occurs to me that I wouldn't want to meet anything coming in the oppos ... ah - a removal lorry. We pass one another - perhaps this car's only wide on the inside? My confidence is growing. </p> <p>While I am searching for the headlight switch, it speaks to me. It says, \"Sorry.\"</p> <p>\"I beg your pardon?\"</p> <p>\"Sorry,\" it replies.</p> <p>Ah, voice commands. \"Where's the headlamp switch?\" I ask in an authoritative voice.</p> <p>\"Sorry.\"</p> <p>The lights and wipers can be set to automatic, which is useful because the heavens have opened.</p> <p>Another spin and another surprise; I am travelling south-west at an altitude of 300ft - I hadn't noticed this feature before. As far as I can tell, we're still on the road. I'll head to Aldermaston; perhaps there's an in-built Geiger counter as well.</p> <p>The three back seats are a bit sit-up-and-beg, but there's plenty of room. Unfortunately I am now trapped. The locks are child-proof and the only way back is an unseemly scramble over the headrests - embarrassing. The boot is vast and contains a couple of dicky seats - I get my foot trapped. These must be to where unruly children are banished on long journeys.</p> <p>At last the final mysteries unravel. The satnav directs me home in the voice of a dour bingo caller, becoming excited as we cross the \"Bebebebaaaysingstoke road!\" The cruise control is nothing to do with Scientology, but to save you from pressing the accelerator, and the ESP control helps prevent skidding, possibly by extending a broom to sweep the road ahead - I wouldn't be surprised, it's got everything else. Not the most economical car, but a pretty good sport.</p>",
  "<p>I don't know what time it is, because the curtains are drawn. It doesn't matter what time it is anyway, because I am jet lagged, hopelessly off schedule, ready for bed at any time of day. I only know that my wife is reading because her reading light is shining in my eyes.</p> <p>\"Why are you reading?\" I say. \"Stop reading.\" I'm not sure how long you have to be married before you start to consider reading a book to be an aggressive act. Normally it's considered one of the least antisocial things you can do, but when you hear a light snap on at 4am, the idea that someone is improving themselves at your expense seems premeditated and sinister.</p> <p>\"Shut up,\" says my wife. I can feel that my face is waffle-stamped with the crochet pattern of some new throw pillows my wife bought, which she arranged down the middle of the bed, like a wall.</p> <p>\"Not a wall,\" she'd insisted, \"just a demarcation.\" I threw two on the floor and accidentally slept on the third, but now I wish the wall was intact to block out the light.</p> <p>\"Reading,\" I say, struggling to turn thoughts into words, \"is stupid.\"</p> <p>\"Actually,\" says my wife, \"there's a bit in this book you might like to read. I've marked it for you specially.\" She holds it open at a page about halfway through. I make a show of feeling around for my glasses. The book is a paperback copy of Heartburn by Nora Ephron. All I know of this book is that it concerns the disintegration of a marriage, and is in fact a thinly veiled account of the disintegration of Ephron's own marriage, and that it was also a movie with Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep. I've never seen the film, because I was about 22 when it came out and it seemed to have nothing to do with me.</p> <p>\"Just read from there,\" says my wife, pointing, \"until you thinks it stops being relevant.\" I skim, trying to get my bearings mid-narrative. After a period of estrangement the husband has returned to find the wife not wearing her wedding ring. She has not taken it off on purpose, however. It just so happens she was recently robbed.</p> <p>\"It's not funny,\" says the wife. \"He held a gun to my head.\"</p> <p>\"Just because you don't think it's funny doesn't mean I don't think it's funny,\" says the husband. \"Maybe I could get a column out of it.\"</p> <p>I angle my head slightly so that the tensing of neck muscles doesn't show, and skim on: \"He began to nod slowly, the way he does whenever he gets an idea for a column\" ... \"As if I were living with a cannibal\" ... \"Things barely finished happening before Mark was chewing away at them\" ... \"I sometimes felt that nothing had happened to me\" ... \"Every time something did happen, Mark got a column out of it and in essence made it seem as if it had all happened to him ...\"</p> <p>I continue to read, expressionless, until the main characters catch the Eastern Airlines shuttle to Washington.</p> <p>\"Eastern Airlines,\" I say, \"doesn't exist any more.\"</p> <p>\"He saps the life from her and writes about it for money,\" says my wife. \"Recognise anything?\"</p> <p>\"That just gives you an idea of how long ago it was written.\"</p> <p>\"She is the interesting one. He just feeds off her.\"</p> <p>I can't think of anything to say at this point, although I wonder if there are any pages near the back of the book I should rip out before returning it to her. Then I get an idea.</p> <p>\"I'm going to write about this,\" I say, nodding.</p> <p>\"You can't,\" says my wife.</p> <p>\" 'Unfortunately, I must continue writing these invasive columns for money because my wife orders so much stuff from catalogues, the end.' \"</p> <p>\"I don't order from catalogues!\" she shouts. \"That's a complete lie!\"</p> <p>\"Because my wife orders so much stuff from catalogues.

But Harold Macmillan made much the same pitch . . . By the standards of our own time, Cameron may count as a moderniser, but at heart he is a traditional One Nation Tory . . . And how good Cameron's manners are - something he has in common with Tony Blair: Jones shows us a man who is almost alarmingly adept at revealing not one word more than he wishes.\" </p> <p>\"His book is as much about himself as it is about Mount Ararat,\" wrote <strong>John Morrish</strong> in the Independent on Sunday, reviewing Frank Westerman's Ararat: In Search of the Mythical Mountain. \"While he gives us a comprehensive account of the mountain's mythology and history, and tells the story of his determination to climb it, he also explores a more personal issue: that of his loss of religious faith.\" \"His journey . . . brings in the Armenian genocide, Atat\u00fcrk, the Kurdish insurgency and Orhan Pamuk,\" said <strong>Jeremy Seal</strong> in the Sunday Telegraph. \"Less excusable are a number of dull inclusions, not least an ongoing account of the bureaucracy entailed in securing a climbing visa, which only add to the impression of a book so swollen with uneven content as to burst its narrative banks.\" Nevertheless, <strong>Alexander Waugh</strong> in the Spectator called it \"a short book of stupendous richness and complexity . . . All this diverse material is held together by a thread of tension as to whether Westerman will find faith halfway up the mountain . . . The book (a fine translation from the Dutch by Sam Garrett) is unquestionably eccentric, but written with enough knowledge, craft and competence to keep the drowsiest of readers wide awake from first to last.\"</p>",
  "<p>Zinfandel's origins were for a long time a mystery, but DNA testing has confirmed this grape is identical to Puglia's primitivo, and has its origins in an almost extinct grapevine native to the Croatian island of Kastela, itself a parent of the Croatian vine plavac mali. The wine - rather a hostage to trends in the American wine business - can range from a sweetened-up pale pink wine labelled white zinfandel (an inspired 1980s solution to California's surplus of zinfandel and shortage of white wine grapes) to a serious oak-aged, long-lived, taut, spicy, dense, lively full-bodied red.</p> <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>Zinfandel has become California's signature red wine grape. The zinfandel vine has a tendency to produce too many grapes, which themselves tend to ripen unevenly, so it needs careful management to yield good wine, but there are parcels of very old vines all over California, and particularly in gold rush country such as Amador and El Dorado, and in parts of Sonoma settled by Italian immigrants in the early 20th century. In 1862, a French winemaker working in California reported that a zinfandel wine tasted like \"a good French claret\", and by the turn of the century it was widely regarded as California's own claret. It has become a patriotic grape in the US, and is most often used to make varietal wines rather than blends.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>So high is zinfandel's profile in California that it is planted in many other warmer wine regions in the US, as well as in South America, South Africa and Australia, all of which have a warm enough climate for it to ripen fully.

  "<p>MG Vassanji is one of the unsung greats of African literature. An Ismaili Muslim of Gujarati heritage, born in Kenya and raised in Tanzania, he attended the University of Nairobi before winning a scholarship to MIT to study nuclear physics. In 1978 he moved to Canada to work at the Ontario nuclear research facility. He began his literary career two years later. So far, his writing has focused on the experience of south Asians in east Africa. This mainly merchant community has been around since the 1850s, but trade has existed between the two continents since at least the 13th century. It was a Gujarati sea pilot who led Vasco da Gama from Kenya to India in 1498.</p> <p>This long history gives Vassanji's fiction a fascinating depth of field. In The Gunny Sack, published in 1989, a Tanzanian Asian is bequeathed a sack full of ancient mementos, which provokes a gallery of stories. The book won a Commonwealth Writers' Prize. A stream of novels has since followed, most recently The In-Between World of Vikram Lall (2004), which tells the story of a young Indian who grows up in Mau Mau Kenya and then moves to Toronto, where he is numbered \"one of Africa's most corrupt men\". Typically, Vassanji's books dramatise the doubly alienated plight of the east African Asian (alienated from both Africa and India). To this has gradually been added description of Asian experience in Canada and the United States. </p> <p>His work shares some aspects with north America-based Indian writers such as Rohinton Mistry and Bharati Mukherjee. It also bears comparison with the \"British wing\" of the Indian/Pakistani diaspora, from Salman Rushdie to rising stars such as Tahmima Anam and Nikita Lalwani. But Vassanji's writing is closest to the knotted postcolonial experience described, albeit in very different ways, by Caribbean Asian writers such as VS Naipaul and David Dabydeen. In much postcolonial writing, cultural identity is presented as fluid but also recursive to heritage, as if one could only tell one's own story by knowing the skin of one's neighbour. With his new novel, The Assassin's Song, Vassanji has met this issue of difference-based self-labelling head on.</p> <p>The main cultural background of the novel involves the history of Muslims in the Indian state of Gujarat. The story takes the reader from a 13th-century village there to the United States in the 1960s and Canada in the 1980s. We move back to Gujarat in 2002, when brutal Hindu-Muslim riots took place. After Kashmir, Gujarat remains the most communally sensitive region in India, as witnessed by a resurgence of violence there last month.</p> <p>The narrator Karsan's father is the saheb of Pirbaag, lord and keeper of an ancient Sufi shrine in Gujarat. His village home is overlooked by the mausoleum of the mystic Pir Bawa, around whose magical activities the shrine came into being in 1260. Although the teenage Karsan wishes the distinction would simply go away - he just wants to play cricket - he must succeed his father. </p> <p>In due course he must take on the mantle and learn the secret of the shrine. This is concentrated in the speaking of a \"bol\", a mantra passed from father to son. The position does not just involve guardianship; to be saheb is to be avatar of a cosmic force, in which Sikhs and Hindus as well as Muslims believe. Pir Bawa himself was a syncretic figure who mixed occultism with Islam and the classical Hinduism of his once-welcoming Gujarati hosts. </p> <p>\"But now the shrine lies in ruins, a victim of the violence that so gripped our state recently, an orgy of murder and destruction of the kind we euphemistically call 'riots'. Only the rats visit the Sufi now, to root among the ruins. My father is dead and so is my mother. And my brother militantly calls himself a Muslim and is wanted for questioning regarding a horrific crime.\"</p> <p>The novel reveals its forthcoming action in a proleptic first chapter. We learn of Karsan's childhood, and see him accepted by Harvard. The novel then shifts register to describe, with high comedy, the experience of being an Indian immigrant at a predominantly white US university in the 1960s. Karsan falls in love with hippy Marge, studies English poetry, gets his PhD, and moves to British Columbia to work as an academic. He forgets, or thinks he has forgotten, the bol that is the key to his identity.</p> <p>He loses touch with his father, who is left distraught by Karsan's rejection of his heritage. But devotees of the sect, whom Karsan meets in urban America, pull at the string of faith, being all too ready to accept him at face value as the incarnation of the cosmos. When Karsan returns to India, he finds Pirbaag despoiled and his brother on the run from the police. Eventually he remembers the bol and takes his place as guardian of the ruined shrine.</p> <p>We never know the exact words of the bol, only that it illuminates a connection between present-day Ismailis and the medieval Shia sect of the Assassins, \"who disdained the outer forms of worship and the Muslim laws of Sharia for inner spiritual truths\", and were also feared for their \"penchant for murdering their enemies with impudent and terrifying facility\". </p> <p>Although he has returned to his heritage, Karsan is still left asking the same existential questions - who am I? Am I real? - that an individual from any culture on earth might ask. Making a general virtue of its own exceptionalism, The Assassin's Song is thus both particular and universal, which is one of the marks of great literature. Historical novel, bildungsroman and terrorist thriller all rolled into one, it is above all a celebration of religious tolerance, which is something more necessary now than ever in Gujarat and elsewhere. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Giles Foden recently ghosted Manubhai Madhvani's Tide of Fortune, the memoir of a Gujarati merchant family who emigrated to East Africa in 1893.</p>",
  "<p>\"Chocolate\" to chardonnay's \"vanilla\", cabernet sauvignon ripens later than the white grape and so tends to be planted in warmer areas. The wine it produces has a powerful aroma of blackcurrant wherever it is grown and, if matured in newish oak, can smell of cedar, cigar boxes and, sometimes, tobacco. It is also notable for being deep purple in youth and, while not especially alcoholic, it can be very long-lived. This is because the small, thick-skinned grapes have a very high ratio of solids rich in colouring matter and tannins to juice. If the grapes are anything less than fully ripe, however, the wine can smell of crushed green leaves - \"herbaceous\". This means cabernet can make great wine, but it is not necessarily the best grape for wines to be drunk young, particularly when grown in cooler climates.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, cabernet sauvignon is not Bordeaux's most planted vine. Because it is relatively late ripening, it ideally needs a warmer, drier environment than much of Bordeaux can provide. It is therefore most important in the well-drained gravels of the mild M\u00e9doc and Graves - on Bordeaux's left bank - where it is invariably the chief constituent of wines, but always blended with merlot, cabernet franc and sometimes with petit verdot. </p> <p>In the M\u00e9doc, it is the main varietal component in St Est\u00e8phe wines, which are taut and austere in youth (though they are getting more welcoming with every vintage); in the dense, mineral-scented Pauillacs; in many a lush, silky Margaux; and in the beautifully balanced yet long-lived St Juliens. </p> <p>Cabernet sauvignon brings crispness and long life to the wines of Graves, and the suggestion of warm bricks common to several from Pessac-L\u00e9ognan. It is planted all round greater Bordeaux in the appellations that make up France's south-west region, and is out-tannined only by the tannat grape of Madiran. Bergerac and Buzet are its chief strongholds. </p> <p>Elsewhere in France, it is grown in the Loire (where cabernet franc is much easier to ripen), but most of the rest is in the south. In Provence, it can blend beautifully with the spicier syrah to make ambitious, oak-aged wines for the long term. In the Languedoc, it is all too often underripe and yields rather lean, hollow vins de pays, although there are exceptions.</p> <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>California, particularly its northern regions, has made some intense cabernets with great skill, arguably proving itself the grape's second home. Much of the Napa Valley seems particularly well suited to it, and this will continue to be one of the world's most fruitful hunting grounds for lovers of super-ripe cabernet. Blends made according to the Bordeaux recipe are often called meritage here. Washington's merlot is generally more successful than its cabernet sauvignon, but there are some appetising exceptions.</p> <p><strong>South America</strong></p> <p>Cabernet cuttings were taken to South America long before the phylloxera pest struck in Europe over a century ago, and Chile's wine industry was built on this variety. In fact, its largest firm, Concha y Toro, has claimed to be the world's most important owner of a \"cab sav\" vineyard. Most Chilean cabernet is still ungrafted (in Europe, vines were grafted on to a more resistant species from North America to beat phylloxera), and has a very direct, fruity flavour, without the mintiness associated with parts of California and Australia.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Australia defined its perfect spot for cabernet sauvignon before any other variety: Coonawarra, in the far south-east of South Australia, on a small and hotly disputed strip of terra rossa earth. These wines tend to have a high level of acidity as well as some notes of eucalyptus. Margaret River in Western Australia can also make great, refined, more complex cabernet, and there are fine examples all over Victoria as well as in the Hunter Valley and elsewhere. In Australia, cabernet is often blended with the much richer, fleshier shiraz.</p> <p><strong>Italy</strong></p> <p>Cabernet sauvignon has made some of Italy's most ambitious wines, notably \"Supertuscans\", in which it is sometimes blended with sangiovese. In the Maremma on the Tuscan coast, a host of estates have followed the example of Sassicaia, one of the first Italian reds made in the image of fine red Bordeaux. There are also bottlings from as far afield as Piedmont and Sicily. Bottles from the north-east described simply as \"cabernet\" almost certainly contain cabernet franc, and sometimes carmen\u00e8re, rather than cabernet sauvignon.<br><strong><br>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>While cabernet sauvignon is relatively rare in Spain and Portugal, it is planted widely in central Europe and does well in the warmer Mediterranean regions, notably Lebanon and Israel. Cape winemakers have tended to make 100% cabernets, unsoftened by merlot or leavened by cabernet franc. New Zealand's best examples are grown in the relatively warm Hawke's Bay region and on Waiheke Island. While cabernet sauvignon has shown some satisfying regional variations, in many parts its slow evolution is being re-evaluated, often to the benefit of other, fleshier red varieties. It may be that, in a decade or two, cabernet will be more exclusively the preserve of the world's most ambitious winemakers.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2006, Australia</strong><br><strong>\u00a37.99, Sainsbury's</strong></p> <p>Made for Sainsbury's by Katnook, this exhibits classic Coonawarra style: dusty blackcurrants and a faint menthol tinge.

  "<p>Cabernet franc is an important variety famous for playing second fiddle to cabernet sauvignon, even though it can make some extremely </p> <p>fine wines in its own right (notably in France's St \u00c9milion, on Bordeaux's right bank, and in the middle Loire). What's more, DNA profiling has actually shown it to be a parent of cabernet sauvignon, along with the white grape sauvignon blanc.</p> <p>The vine looks much like cabernet sauvignon, except that the leaves are less indented. Cabernet franc buds and ripens earlier, which makes it more susceptible to coulure (where the grapes fail to develop), but it needs less heat to ripen fully. In left-bank Bordeaux, it is seen, with merlot, as a sort of insurance policy against a cool season.</p> <p>In very general terms, wine made from cabernet franc tends to be aromatically fruity, lighter and less tannic than cabernet sauvignon and, especially in the Loire, can smell appetisingly of pencil shavings. It is often rather herbaceous, and unripe cabernet sauvignon frequently smells like cabernet franc.</p> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p>Cabernet franc is an ingredient in most of the reds of south-west France, and often the sole inspiration for the fine, silky reds of the middle Loire, such as Saumur-Champigny, Bourgueil, Chinon and Anjou-Villages.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Cabernet franc is widely grown in north-east Italy (where it is sometimes called cabernet frank or even bordo) and some Friuli examples are ripe enough to be thrilling. It is also grown over the border in Slovenia, although cabernet sauvignon is much more common in the rest of central Europe. In the new world, in most of which cabernet sauvignon can easily be ripened, cabernet franc is widely regarded as essential for respectability to make up the holy Bordeaux trio, with merlot. Varietal versions have emerged from Australia, South Africa and California to show just how appetising this variety can be unblended. It really shines in cooler regions such as Long Island in New York state, parts of Washington state and New Zealand.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Saumur Les Nivi\u00e8res 2006, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99, Waitrose</strong></p> <p>This breezy standby has the invigorating smell of a particularly good summer pudding, dripping with the juice of raspberries, redcurrants and blueberries.

  "<p>Tempranillo is Spain's most respected grape variety, and is widely planted. Its name comes from temprano, or early, which is when it ripens (although \"early\" can be well into October in Rioja). Spain's answer to cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo is similarly high in tannins and acidity but, unusually for Spain, is not necessarily very high in alcohol. Tempranillo-based wines are some of Spain's longest-lasting.</p> <p><strong>Spain</strong></p> <p>Tempranillo is sometimes made into a single varietal wine in Spain, but is also often blended with other grapes and labelled according to the region in which it is made. It provides the spine for Rioja (garnacha, or grenache, providing the flesh). Tempranillo is by far the main ingredient in Ribera del Duero, where it is so common it is simply known as tinto fino. In Pened\u00e9s it is important as ull de llebre, and in Valdepe\u00f1as, called cencibel, it makes rather less concentrated wines (sometimes lightened by blending in white grapes). It is also grown in La Mancha, Costers del Segre, Utiel-Requena and, especially, in Navarra and Somontano.</p> <p>Oak ageing is crucial to traditional Rioja, and the length of time spent in the cask or bottle is indicated on the label by reserva (a minimum of three years ageing, of which at least one must be in oak), crianza (slightly less) or gran reserva (even longer). Many modern producers bottle their top wines earlier than in the past, however. Particularly fruity Riojas may be labelled as joven (young) or sin crianza (unoaked).</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Tempranillo is grown, as tinta roriz, in northern Portugal, where it is valued for port as well as unfortified wines. </p> <p>A little tempranillo is grown in southern Oregon and there are experimental plantings all over the wine world, including Chile, South Africa and Australia, where the variety's characteristic \"tobacco leaf\" flavour seems to survive well.

  "<p>Nebbiolo is Italy's noblest vine but, like pinot noir, it is fussy about both soil and site and extremely expressive of it. Wine made from nebbiolo is markedly high in both acidity and, especially, tannin - which is why the grapes need to be properly ripe to have enough fruit to counterbalance all this astringency. Wines are not particularly deeply coloured (although they can brown quite easily) and have a haunting smell that reminds many of tar, roses and sometimes violets. These are extremely serious wines that demand long ageing and attention (dolcetto and barbera, more widely produced Italian grapes, are for earlier glugging). Limited supply of nebbiolo can lead to high price tags.</p> <p><strong>Italy </strong></p> <p>Nebbiolo is a speciality of Piedmont, and the Piedmontese show their respect for the vine by restricting its planting to a few selected areas: nebbiolo wines account for just 3% of the region's total production. It is grown - strictly in vineyards that stand a chance of ripening this late-ripening variety - all over the region, but reaches its apogee in the hills of Barolo and Barbaresco, shrouded in autumn by fog, or nebbia, which may have inspired nebbiolo's name. </p> <p>It is also grown successfully as spanna (the Novarese name for nebbiolo) in the north of Piedmont, to produce such wines as Gattinara and Ghemme - in which the nebbiolo is usually softened with a small portion of the local grapes bonarda and vespolina. Nebbiolo is even grown just over the border in Lombardy, in Valtellina, where it is known as chiavennasca. In the alps of Valle d'Aosta and the far north-west of Piedmont, called picutener, it makes Carema. </p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>A little nebbiolo is grown in California, Australia and Argentina, but Italy really is where it's at.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Renato Ratti Langhe Nebbiolo 2006, Italy </strong><br><strong>\u00a310.99, M&amp;S</strong></p> <p>I've yet to taste a nebbiolo under a tenner that is worth dirtying a glass for.

  "<p>The pinot noir grower's lot is not an easy one. It is a grape that is capable of producing divinely scented, gorgeously fruity expressions of place, but is often unwilling or unable to do so. This ancient eastern French vine is prone to mutation, and there is wide variation in wine quality between different clones. Planting the wrong clone in the wrong place is one of many reasons for the variation in quality. </p> <p>Pinot noir is also sensitive to the size of crop it is expected to produce, and many vapid examples testify to an over-demanding yield. It ripens relatively early, so is not suitable for very warm regions where there would be no time to develop interesting flavours before acid levels plummet. On the other hand, many of the cooler regions in which it thrives suffer autumn rains, which can rot pinot's thin-skinned berries, resulting in pale, tainted wines. </p> <p>For years the received wisdom was that it was nearly impossible to make decent pinot noir outside Burgundy, but by the 1990s this had been disproved - and if the new wave of new world pinot noir for the moment lacks any great expression of place, it generally provides more pleasure per penny than the average bottle of Burgundy.</p> <p><strong>France </strong></p> <p>In Burgundy (Bourgogne in French), pinot noir is the medium through which tiny environmental differences (terroir) express themselves. Flavours found in young red Burgundies include raspberries, strawberries, cherries and violets; with time, these evolve into a bouquet often reminiscent of game, liquorice and autumnal undergrowth (there is an argument that red Burgundy has to be very good indeed to be worth ageing more than about five years). The French are growing increasing quantities outside Burgundy, notably in Champagne, where it has proved itself the ideal dark-skinned grape for top-quality sparkling wine (for which purpose it is also used in Italy, California and Australia, as well as England). </p> <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>Oregon, in the US Pacific Northwest, staked its wine reputation on pinot noir (presumably inspired by its distinctly Burgundian wet autumns) and has enjoyed considerable success, especially in the Willamette Valley in the north-west. More unexpectedly, California has demonstrated that it, too, has no shortage of spots cool enough (thanks to Pacific fog) to keep pinot grapes on the vine as they develop, welcoming fruity flavours and some texture to boot. Notable among these spots are Carneros, the Russian River Valley and even cooler coastal sites in Sonoma, and Santa Maria and the Santa Rita hills north of Santa Barbara - although the Santa Lucia Highlands, Chalone and Calera wineries have proved that isolated pinot greatness can be found in the mountains south of San Francisco, too.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong></p> <p>Australians have identified Victoria (notably the Yarra Valley, Geelong and the Mornington Peninsula) and Tasmania as being cool enough for pinot, but it is New Zealand that has shown a real affinity with the grape. Martinborough in the south of New Zealand's North Island was the first region to prove it, but has been followed by virtually all South Island wine regions, notably Central Otago. </p> <p>In 1997, pinot noir overtook cabernet sauvignon as the most widely planted red variety in New Zealand. A significant proportion of the crop is destined for sparkling wine production.</p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>Within Europe, pinot noir travels under a number of aliases. In Germany, as sp\u00e4tburgunder, it is now one of the most planted red wine grapes and, because of climate change, is making some stunningly good examples, even if they are too revered at home to be great bargains outside Germany. Similarly, it is reaching new heights in eastern Switzerland as blauburgunder and (sometimes called blauer sp\u00e4tburgunder) in Austria. It is planted all over central Europe, called variously burgundac crni in what was Yugoslavia and nagyburgundi in Hungary. Since the 1980s, Italians have also been fans of this grape - they call it pinot nero.</p> <p>Most of South Africa is too warm for pinot noir, but there are exceptions in Walker Bay and Elgin. Likewise, most of Iberia is too hot for this finicky variety. Canada has made the odd hopeful pinot and, at the other end of the Americas, Chile and even Argentina have demonstrated a recent facility with this vine, in cooler corners, giving hope to pinot noir strugglers everywhere.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Louis Latour Pinot Noir Domaine de Valmoissine 2006 Vin de Pays du Coteaux du Verdon, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a37.99, Majestic</strong></p> <p>From Burgundy n\u00e9gociant Louis Latour (a n\u00e9gociant buys up the produce of smaller growers and makers), this silky pinot noir is made high up in Provence, 500m above sea level, close to the ravishing scenery of the Gorges du Verdon.

  "<p>Merlot, or merlot noir (no relation to the white grape merlot blanc), is famous as a blending partner, with cabernet franc, for cabernet sauvignon - but it is actually much more widely planted in Bordeaux than either of those grapes.</p> <p>This variety conventionally makes lush, plummy, velvety wine that can soften cabernet's more austere frame and, usefully, matures much faster.

It makes its greatest wines on the right bank of the Gironde, in Pomerol (where it is generally blended with tiny proportions of cabernet franc) and St \u00c9milion (where cabernet franc and sometimes cabernet sauvignon play a more important part).</p> <p>Merlot is also widely grown throughout south-west France, notably in Bergerac and in Cahors. It is also very widely planted in the Languedoc, where it can make juicy, plump vins de pays. Just like merlot the wine, merlot the vine ripens earlier than cabernet sauvignon, but it is less resistant to rot and, if the weather is poor during flowering, can suffer from uneven fruit set.</p> <p><strong>Italy</strong></p> <p>Although almost two-thirds of the world's merlot vines grow in France, most of the rest, until recently, have been grown in north-east Italy, particularly in Friuli, where tourists can follow the Strada del Merlot along the Isonzo river. In this region, it can make plumper wines than the prevailing cabernet. Quality varies from basic light red varietals to rich, dense barrique-aged wines, often blended with cabernet and/or sangiovese. The variety is planted in 14 of Italy's 20 regions, and is being taken seriously by a handful of producers in Tuscany and Umbria as well as Friuli. Many prefer it to cabernet sauvignon for being a less dominant blending partner with native Italian varieties.</p> <p><strong>North America</strong></p> <p>Merlot was planted at a lick in both North and South America. In the 1990s it was regarded as \"the hot varietal\" in the cabernet-soaked state of California, but has since fallen from favour so that today it is more readily associated with often rather sweet-tasting everyday varietals. </p> <p>Merlot has a proven track record in Washington state, however, where it is the second most planted grape, and is increasingly grown in other North American states, notably in the vineyards of New York's Long Island.</p> <p><strong>South America</strong></p> <p>Merlot is hugely important to Chile - or rather vines traditionally called merlot <br>have been. In the mid-1990s it was discovered that a significant proportion of <br>them were in fact the old Bordeaux variety carmen\u00e8re, and since then there has been a drive to correctly identify what is planted in the vineyard, label it truthfully, and to increase plantings of true merlot. Chile has already found its own perfect spot for merlot, Apalta in Colchagua, and the best-made examples combine California gloss with even more obvious fruit. </p> <p>In Argentina, such merlot as is grown is generally blended with cabernet sauvignon, following the classic Bordeaux recipe. </p> <p><strong>Elsewhere</strong></p> <p>There is great potential for merlot in cooler regions, whether produced as a straight varietal or blended with other grapes. While it is grown as a blending partner for cabernet in Australia and New Zealand, few varietal wines of real distinction have emerged there, although they surely will. New Zealand clearly has potential, particularly in Hawke's Bay in North Island. </p> <p>Merlot is now the fourth most popular red wine variety in South Africa, which has already shown just how gorgeous an oak-aged merlot ripened in a relatively warm climate can be. Romania, Bulgaria and Moldova also grow significant quantities of merlot, which can be difficult to distinguish, in terms of wine quality, from their cabernet.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore recommends</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Domaine des Eyssards 2005 Bergerac Rouge, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.99, Waitrose</strong></p> <p>Bergerac is the place to look for an affordable take on Bordeaux, and this lightly oaked, sweetly ripe, plump and cushioned blend of merlot (70%) and cabernet franc (30%) really earns its keep. The sauvignon blanc-based white from the same producer is also very good.</p> <p><strong>One to lust after</strong></p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau Moulinet Pomerol 2004, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a319, M&amp;S</strong></p> <p>The vintage that preceded the feted 2005 is proving very good value, and the wines are already drinking nicely. This merlot-based blend is sumptuous, chocolatey and rich without being over the top. Good now or will keep another few years.<br><strong>Victoria Moore</strong></p> <h2>Drink with</h2> <p>Great examples of merlot are soft, forward and generous. This grape's thinner skin means finer tannins, which opens the door to a wider range of possibilities when it comes to food and wine matching. As far as suitable partners go, veal is an obvious choice. Milder in flavour than beef, coupled with a softer texture and less fat, veal - chargrilled and served pink - is a classic match for merlot. A dollop of good Dijon mustard, a scoop of creamy mash and a wedge of lemon on the side will only add to the magic.<br><strong>Matt Skinner</strong></p> <h2>Background</h2> <p><strong>Say it right </strong>Mer-low</p> <p><strong>Makes</strong> wines that are fruity, fleshy, soft and smooth</p> <p><strong>Hotspots</strong> Merlot is grown almost everywhere wine can be grown</p> <p><strong>Good companions </strong>Cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc</p> <p><strong>Legends</strong> Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus and Ch\u00e2teau Le Pin in Pomerol, France; Ornellaia's Masseto in Tuscany; Leonetti in Washington state</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> Despite the infamous Sideways swipe (\"If anyone orders merlot, I'm leaving\"), sales of merlot in the US are more than double those of pinot noir, the next bestselling red wine</p> <p><strong>If you like</strong> merlot, try sangiovese</p> <p><em>\"If they want to drink merlot, we're drinking merlot\"</em><br><strong>Jack in Sideways</strong> (Miles was rather less easy-going)</p>",
  "<p>When I'm in toy shops with my family, I quietly run my eye around the shelves to see if they have one. They never do, but I keep looking. I don't say anything to the children and I certainly don't ask at the counter. I'm worried the staff will be shocked by my question or think less of me and assume I have a dangerous dog tethered outside. I'm scanning the shelves for a toy gun. Not any toy gun: a James Bond toy gun. </p> <p>This autumn, the 007 film Quantum of Solace is released and the first licensed Bond toys have been unveiled. I'm excited because my whole family has developed a shared interest in the Bond series, most of all my son, who's seven. I too was a Bond fan when I was seven, back in 1971; I too watched the films with my father, and the real centre of my secret agent fantasy world was my gun. </p> <p>I remember with utter clarity my Lone Star 007 cap gun. It stood apart from other toy firearms in that it came with a silencer. I was able, in character, to attach the silencer to the barrel and make a deadened thudding noise with my mouth as I \"fired\". The silencer fascinated me because it represented cool-headed professionalism. Anyone could shoot someone but it took real presence of mind to attach an extra part to your gun and then shoot someone. </p> <p>Pinned down in my bedroom, probably wearing something itchy and nylon, I didn't panic. I calmly and methodically screwed my silencer on to my gun and did what I needed to do for my country. I also had a shoulder holster and, memory tells me, a lighter that fired plastic pellets. All of which amplified these qualities of manly savoir faire and mastery of one's tools. The interest in the gun was not about killing or violence, it was a glimpse of life as an adult. James Bond represented the kind of man I wanted to be - not a trained assassin, but someone resourceful with cool stuff he'd use to overcome obstacles.</p> <p>I have grown up to be one of the least James Bond men in the universe. I wear luminous cycle clips on my bike, foreign travel makes me nervous (what if I suffer a tummy bug?) and if ever called upon to defend the world against a criminal genius I would opt to do so in a clerical capacity. </p> <p>It is precisely because I am a namby, non-violent modern type of man that I enjoy the escape into microfilm, facially disfigured baddies and unsafe driving that Bond offers. I genuinely don't know whether I should've introduced our most famous secret agent to my family, but he has brought me pleasure over the years and one rainy afternoon I came home with the complete Sean Connery box set. </p> <p>You introduce your children to all kinds of cultural influences that have meant something to you and it's impossible to predict which will take hold and which will be met with indifference. Bond was an instant hit. The cool-period jazz of Miles Davis is yet to catch on. </p> <p>With the four of us watching Bond as a family, my partner and I hoped to place the violence and the (far more shocking) gender politics in context. Now we've been to an Ian Fleming exhibition and we own all the films and a couple of posters. The children dress up in crazed approximations of formal evening wear and occasionally allow me into their games. My son hogs the Bond role and my daughter plays female spies who start bad but later change their minds. I'm left playing a series of megalomaniacs (and, yes, I do the central-European accents if you must know). Obviously, as I have plans to take over the entire lounge and garden, Bond has to outwit and finally kill me. He could attempt rehabilitation and find me useful work in the community, but on the whole he'd rather shoot me - over and over again until dinner time. The weapon of choice is mostly pointed fingers. These are sometimes accompanied by an incongruous pirate cutlass from the dressing-up box. </p> <p>So I can picture the pure joy the addition of a proper weapon would bring to our household but I also realise that while I'm taking cover behind the sofa, real gun-crime is creeping on to our streets. We know now that another horribly out-of-context family photograph of a young person on the news means there has been yet more death in violent circumstances. Last week saw the police uncovering a real gun factory converting replicas into deadly machine guns. Chillingly, the replicas were bought from a legitimate source with the cover story that they were to be used in a James Bond film. The arrival of this terrifying, desperately depressing gun culture understandably means that not everyone finds the idea of a seven-year-old with a toy pistol entirely comfortable.</p> <p>Somewhat conflicted (and typecast as a criminal genius), I remain reluctant to give up on buying a Bond gun, but my search of London's toy shops is turning into a hopeless quest. Not only are there no branded Bond-esque guns, there are virtually no toy guns anywhere at all. Have they been banned and no one told me? Am I a dysfunctional dad for even wanting one? Should I make one from Lego? I decide to take my search more seriously. </p> <p>I sit and methodically work my way through a list of toy shops, call and ask them whether they sell guns. They all tell me they don't and when I ask why most respond as though the answer is self evident: \"All the usual reasons - it's inappropriate in the present climate and they have such negative connotations.\"</p> <p>I find a memorabilia site called James Bond Toys. Here, collectors pay huge sums for what were once the contents of the cupboard in my boyhood bedroom. If I didn't have to earn a living, I would devote most of my time to looking at pictures on this site and communing with secret agent suitcase sets with binoculars, plastic daggers, rare, branded roulette games and, of course, guns - with silencers. I call Nick Bennett, who runs the collection, thinking vaguely that I might splash out \u00a330 or \u00a340 and treat my son to the exact model I once owned myself. He tells me that the gun I was probably playing with in the early 70s would cost me around \u00a3200 and anyway he doesn't sell them to children. </p> <p>His argument is passionate and coherent: \"I don't want kids running round with toy guns these days; there is too much violence in other media. Children nowadays can access any amount of violence at any time through DVDs and video games. I see children playing 18 certificate computer games all the time. I think if children could re-enact those games with guns they wouldn't have the education to understand that this was wrong. When we used to play with guns as a child there was an innocence to it. We didn't see the effect a gun could have. Now you can.\"</p> <p>I track down the company that has first dibs on licensed Bond toys in the UK, Popco Entertainment. This is appro-priately called the Master Toy License. (I hope someone shouts, \"We have the master toy license!\" in a middle-European accent.) </p> <p>Barry Eldridge, Popco's marketing manager, confirms that they have no plans for a Quantum of Solace gun. He says there is no market for them and secondly they wouldn't be allowed to make them accurately enough. The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 has outlawed anything that could be mistaken for the real thing, to the extent that a range of bright, non-gun-like colours have been prescribed for toys. This legislation is entirely reasonable and nothing to do with the government attempting to influence play - it is designed to stop crimes being carried out, or potentially fatal confusion arising, if the police were called to deal with someone holding a realistic toy gun. </p> <p>Eldridge outlines the effect of this law on the toy industry: \"If you go into any toy shop you will find that 99% of toy weapons are fantasy weapons - cowboy guns, space guns, that kind of thing. Something that's meant to be a machine gun is covered in white splodges. Bond is about realism, and you couldn't have a bright pink Walther PPK - that would be wrong.\" Popco will be making a Quantum of Solace range called 007 Mission Arsenal. This arsenal will be a modern one in that it will not contain a gun but will consist of secret phones, surveillance cameras and invisible pen sets. The young Bonds will presumably communicate their enemies to death. </p> <p>So life has moved on to the point where my old 007 gun has become a dangerous irrelevance and yet I can still picture the pleasure it would bring to our games. Penny Holland is a child development expert and author of We Don't Play with Guns Here. She used to be against all toy guns but now believes that such games could play an important role in growing up. \"There are all sorts of issues that children are playing with when they use weapons in hero-related games,\" she says. \"These have very little to do with violence and more to do with safety. When you are a very young child, you have to deal with leaving secure situations such as nursery and school and preparing to leave your family and become independent in the world.\" She says acting out the role of someone invulnerable can be a way of preparing for independence. Holland sees the way guns have been pushed out of nurseries and schools as an unthinking adult response that doesn't reflect the way children use fantasy to make sense of real life. </p> <p>I describe for her my games with my son and she asks about the way I explain real violence to him, because this is the context for our James Bond role-play. As long as I explain the damage actual aggression can do, she doesn't feel that our imaginary battles are harmful. </p> <p>Holland believes that violent adults are formed more by the actual violence in their everyday lives and not by what she terms \"hero-play\". She points out the narrative that drives Bond is an ancient one and reflects the need for invulnerable figures shared by both adults and children. </p> <p>Holland seems to have an impressive grasp of the real ways in which children play. She reminds me that if my son actually hits me during a role-play, I obviously stop the game and tell him that it's ceased to be fun. It's as if she's been watching us. There I am stroking my white cat substitute (a light grey teddy bear), I'm being all cold and ruthless in a Larry Olivier foreigner accent when the young 007 tires of our verbal sparring and rams his fist deep into my scrotum. I'm no longer distant and evil, I'm shouty and cross and saying stuff like: \"That really hurt. Who taught you that? Stop laughing ... \" </p> <p>Like any modern parent, I feel that everyone else spends more time with their children than I do; that other dads are achieving more golden dad moments than I manage and that I shouldn't listen to so much Radio 4 when the children are around. It is really this urge to create memorable (ideally photogenic) child and father situations that had me searching for a Bond gun. I'm not a policymaker or politician, but I have reached a conclusion on this complex issue. What it is needed is a certificate or photo card identifying me as Ever So Nice and therefore allowed to buy toy guns as long as I don't take them out of the house - about three of these certificates could be given out to tremendously nice families every year. I sense the detail of my legislation still needs work ...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Phil Hilton is the editor of Shortlist, a free weekly magazine</p>",
  "<p>She is an ordinary dog. A leg at each of her four corners. An inquisitive nose, which she thrusts into everything - the more disgusting the pile, the better. Bright, button-brown eyes. Two feathered flops for ears. This is Muffin. A spaniel-collie cross- in other words, a bog-standard mongrel. I make no special claims for her. But her role in my life, and in that of my daughter and late husband, Tim, has been crucial. People who do not like animals will never understand her story of canine valour. Others will find it laughingly obvious. Nonetheless, it impresses me: the power of companionship, the pivotal support one small dog can provide. In life, in sickness - and after death. They should put Muffin and her ilk on the NHS: she's better than Prozac and a good deal cheaper. </p> <p>She has been with us nearly nine years now, and it has not been an easy journey, for the dog or her human companions. But definitely worth it. In December 1999, I decided our family needed a pet. We had two goldfish but they were hardly interactive. Our daughter, Molly, was seven - and the initial thrill of the fishes' arrival had long since worn off. But as we started to face up to the reality of Tim's recently confirmed terminal cancer, we all needed a little joy and a bit of bounce in our lives. So I suggested a rescue dog.</p> <p>So far, so good. Off we all went to the RSPCA in central Leeds. I had visions of a gruelling prison visit but it wasn't like that at all. We sat in the waiting room and leafed through a brochure with a write-up of each dog. Then we picked three possibles and they were introduced to us, one by one. All most civilised.</p> <p>The first one - big, blonde and rather smelly - immediately knocked Molly over, ruling herself out at the first strike. The second - a hairy mop on legs - was overexcited and slobbery. The third was a scrawny bag of bones with a scurvy-like skin condition and a sad string for a tail hanging down between her legs. She was an anxious and darting individual. Black and tan and the smallest of the bunch. Curiously, it was Tim - an imposing 6ft 5in - at whom she first launched herself. They say the dog chooses you, rather than the other way round. And she had made her choice. This was Muffin - or rather Sonia, as the RSPCA rather ludicrously called her. </p> <p>Frankly, I was not impressed by any of the three specimens, but both Tim and Molly preferred Sonia. It was intriguing that I had clearly missed something when I met this dog - something that had conveyed itself to both husband and daughter. So I decided to have another look at her, in secret, on my own, just to be sure.</p> <p>The RSPCA allows you to walk your chosen candidate under strictly controlled conditions. I took the little dog up the road from the shelter - a soulless, inner city stretch of tarmac - until I found a scrub of green littered with a few reluctant trees. It was a windy winter's day. There were a few dead leaves swirling around and a good deal of litter. Sonia, who had walked like a robot in front of me all the way, suddenly had a change of character. She stopped dead having spotted a flying leaf and gave chase, in a quick and mad little circle of delight, lips curled back in an unlikely grin. This creature, until now an unattractive collection of troubles and needs, was giving me a glimpse of something else. Character. A sense of humour. Life. That was it. The dog was saved - or, rather, saved herself - and I was sold. </p> <p>Of course, I had to confess my secret mission to the two back home. After a family summit meeting, we decided to adopt her. Sonia came home with us a couple of weeks later. She was re-named Muffin: double chocolate chip. Her life was transformed - and so was ours.</p> <p>The next bit was tricky. Muffin was wild and woebegone. She had no concept of indoors and outdoors, no rhythm or routine to her life, no notion of where she ended and the rest of the world began. She ate erratically and pooed prodigiously - mostly on the carpet at the foot of the stairs or outside people's bedrooms, as if making some kind of scatological sacrifice to her new masters. </p> <p>Although Tim loved dogs and had always longed for one of his own, he was a fastidious man and found all this mess unbearable. One morning, I found him halfway down the stairs, dog muck on his bare foot, bellowing at Muffin, who cowered beneath him by the front door, awestruck by his size and the overpowering volume of his voice. Tim was a quiet man. This outburst was uncharacteristic in the extreme. I had to step between the two of them and calm things down. This was the week before Christmas. The house was in turmoil.</p> <p>Tim may have had doubts about Muffin but she had none about him. As with most of the humans who knew him, she regarded my (normally) gentle giant of a husband with a mixture of tenderness and awe and picked him as pack leader from the second she clapped eyes on him. Soon she became responsive, house-trained, devoted. He, in turn, learned to relax, and their bond was fixed for life - not the dog's, but the man's. They became an inseparable duo. </p> <p>By the end of her first year with us, Muffin was thriving. Her tail, always an accurate barometer of canine wellbeing, metamorphosed from a piece of matted old rope to a waving, feathery plume. She put on weight. Her eyes sparkled. Her star was rising.</p> <p>Tim, meanwhile, was getting sicker. In 2000, he started to work from home. Over the next three years he suffered a multitude of symptoms, due both to the cancer and the heavy medication used to control it. At first, he was still mobile, although he tired easily. He took the dog for long walks in the local wood. They played together - elaborate and interminable chase games with sticks and balls that exhausted them both and bored everybody else, but made them happy. </p> <p>Later, when he was too weak to walk, Muffin lay at his feet and slept. When he vomited, she sometimes retched in sympathy. When he was in pain, she was a silent, sympathetic witness. In her role as companion - even some kind of simple soul mate - she never flinched.</p> <p>In autumn 2003, Tim was admitted to the local hospice and died there in January 2004. Muffin was a frequent and honoured visitor. She was with us, on our last visit to see him, the night before he died. As we left, I took his left hand and placed it under the dog's muzzle. She gave one discreet lick farewell. Like him, she was dignified, accepting.</p> <p>Denial and disbelief at a death are not confined to humans. Muffin looked for Tim constantly in the following days. Every time Molly and I came home in the car she would welcome and count us in at the door, one ... two ... and then run to the passenger door, tail waving high, for number three. </p> <p>But, unlike humans, who find it easy to become mired in grief and hard to move forwards, dogs are pragmatic creatures. The love she had for Tim was quietly and quickly transferred to Molly and myself. She still had a big job to do and became the willing receptacle for all the tense and sorrowful emotions that a bereavement brings in its wake. She became exceptionally alert to distress - knew, from the quality of a walk down the stairs, from a fluttering of the hands, that tears were coming - and was there, like a shot, lying gently at the sufferer's feet, waiting for the storm to erupt, and willing it to quickly subside.</p> <p>Four years on, a different, calmer life is established. Muffin relies on me for all practical considerations. For my daughter she reserves a special devotion - and a great sense of silliness and play. Her role in our small family is integral and much appreciated. She has formed a character as big and bountiful as the problems she presented when she first came.</p> <p>But Muffin is certainly no saintly dog. She has no special powers. She is hairy, messy, noisy when visitors arrive, sulky when ignored and capricious with her appetites. There is a \"princess\" streak in her as pronounced as her skills in nursing and psychotherapy. Her strong attachment to us makes spontaneous trips away very difficult. She is a tie, no question. I grumble at her all the time: she glares back. Neither of us deserves a halo. Both of us, however, accept the mutual dependence.</p> <p>The British are famous for their supposed devotion to their dogs and we do love to assign recognisable human emotions to the species with which we have perhaps the closest bond. I am guilty of this, too. Muffin, I feel certain, is such a gifted individual. In those brown eyes reside - surely - such depths of intelligence and wisdom?</p> <p>In essence, of course, what she does so well is just to be herself: a dog. Our family pet. We miss the point when we ascribe too many of our own feelings to the dogs we own. They do not so much enter our emotional territory as simply share it and reflect it back to us, without judgment or blame. It is that atmosphere of acceptance - of wordless cheer - that is so deeply comforting, even transforming. This is the dog's gift to us.</p> <p>Muffin is 11 now. She is getting a little creaky around the edges: her back end is going slightly, there are white whiskers on her muzzle. Still, she is playful. Still, life is fun. Always there is good faith between us. Loyalty and deep affection. That was the deal. We rescued her, then she rescued us. It is a nice example of the symmetry between animal and human and of a certain, special kind of compassion.</p>",
  "<p>We recently moved to a lovely detached house with a fireplace that has been filled in and fitted with a coal-effect gas fire, which we hate. We would like a proper wood-burning stove - such as we had as children - but I'm not sure what to look for. Is this something my husband could put in? We don't mind spending a bit. Can you help? <br><strong>Eileen and George Royce, Dorset</strong></p> <p>The first thing to check is whether you live in a smoke-free zone. If you go to <a href=\"http://www.uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk/locations.php\">uksmokecontrolareas.co.uk/locations.php</a> and search for your local council it should tell you. It is possible to fit a wood-burning stove yourself, but the procedure is not without pitfalls and you need to know the building regulations (contact the building control inspector at the council, who should be a mine of free information, but be aware that to get it signed off by building control - a legal requirement - may cost you up to \u00a3300). </p> <p>There are dangers: a chimney fire (plus the faulty fitting of a stove would invalidate your insurance) and carbon monoxide poisoning are the two extremes. But yes, people can and do fit them themselves. A really helpful company is Navitron (<a href=\"http://www.navitron.org.uk\">navitron.org.uk</a>, 01572 725512). Although it is a commercial site, it only sells one make of stove - Fireview - as stoves aren't its main thing, but I've always found the advice to be good and largely impartial. There is also a forum so your husband could talk to others who have fitted their own stoves and ask advice. </p> <p>You may need to line your chimney. Although not essential, most installers recommend it - you could argue that this is to make money but unless you are confident of the state of your chimney, it's worth doing. A chimney-liner only costs a couple of hundred pounds but installing it is tricky. Paying about \u00a31,000 for liner plus installation is not unusual. However, I must stress that this is a rough guide gleaned from speaking to installers and people who have had it done. You may pay less, or a bit more, but I would ask questions if it were very much more. </p> <p>Another helpful site is <a href=\"http://www.stovesonline.co.uk\">stovesonline.co.uk</a>, 0845 226 5754, which sells stoves but is chock-full of information, including a useful \"kilowatt calculator\" - good as most people buy stoves that are far too big for the room and end up roasting. Otherwise, find suppliers in your area. The best way is to go to <a href=\"http://www.hetas.co.uk\">hetas.co.uk</a>, 0845 634 5626. Hetas is the government body for solid fuel stove installers, so if an installer is registered with it they are aware of all the building regulations and must comply with them. Also, should anything go wrong, you have comeback through its complaints procedure. Ask at least three suppliers for a quote. </p> <p>Think about what you want your fire to do: it sounds as if you just want it to heat the room and not part-heat the house or water, which makes things slightly simpler and cheaper. (Note: if you use a stove with a back boiler to supplement your home heating, on a really cold day it may require about 40kg of wood. Even on a moderately cold day you are looking at 20kg.)</p> <p>Now then: stoves. Speak to 10 people and they will tell you 10 \"best makes\". Stoves Fireview (from Navitron, as above, \u00a3570-\u00a31,100); Jydepejsen (<a href=\"http://www.jydepejsen.com\">jydepejsen.com</a>, from Zigi's, 01245 360772, \u00a31,440-\u00a32,900) and Jotul (<a href=\"http://www.jotul.com\">jotul.com</a>, 01527 506010, \u00a3597-\u00a32,870) are names that came up frequently in my research, but the best thing is to find a good installer and go from there. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Stovesareus.co.uk\">Stovesareus.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stoves-direct.org.uk\">stoves-direct.org.uk</a> aren't based in your part of the country but are excellent sites and may know of an installer near you. </p> <p>Generally, prices start at about \u00a3400-\u00a3500 for a decent 5kw-output stove. But whichever style you choose - modern or traditional - your stove will be an attractive addition to your home. A reconditioned vintage stove can be a feature all on its own. In the 19th and 20th century, the French made beautiful stoves, often enamelled - check out <a href=\"http://www.stovefinders.com\">stovefinders.com</a>, which sources and supplies classic French stoves, like the art nouveau Lily by Deville.

After that dynamic start, Smith started to sound more and more at home in his own skin during the 1990s, with a north European, Jan Garbarek-tinged tonality increasingly affecting his apprenticeship to the orthodox jazz tradition. Running youth big bands in Scotland, he has just secured the first full-time jazz course at Glasgow's music and drama conservatoire. The subtle, atmospheric Smith is the perfect artist to open this year's Islay Jazz Festival (to September 14), with this duo performance - tuning into the unique island surroundings - with acclaimed Swedish pianist Jacob Karlzon.</p>",
  "<p>One of Europe's leading authorities on organ transplants has warned that changing the law in Britain to \"presumed consent\" for donation would not save lives. </p> <p>Dr Rafael Matesanz, director of the National Transplant Organisation in Spain which has achieved a higher transplantation rate than anywhere else in Europe, said: \"Trying to modify the situation by changing the law, in my opinion, is dangerous because all the effort can concentrate in the law and you forget aspects that are more important.\" </p> <p>Spain has had presumed consent - where it is assumed those who die are willing to donate their organs unless they stated otherwise - since 1979. Its transplant success - it has the highest rate in the world - is cited by those who are now pushing for the same law in the UK. </p> <p>The prime minister and the chief medical officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, have backed the change and a working party is due to report to government on the issue shortly.</p> <p>But Matesanz said yesterday that changing the law was no solution. \"There is no country in the world where there has been sustained improvement after changing the law,\" he said. </p> <p>In the 1980s Spain was still struggling to improve donation rates. Its achievement today - it has 34.3 donations per million people, where the UK has 13.2 and the European average is 16 - was not a result of legal change, but of a dedicated and comprehensive transplant programme. </p> <p>Matesanz's comments will further undermine the case for legal change following revelations this week that intensive care doctors in the UK are deeply concerned about presumed consent. </p> <p>He was backed by Professor John Fabre, professor of clinical science at King's College school of medicine, a former chair of the British Transplant Society, who said that there were ethical issues - presumed consent could not be considered informed consent and therefore was \"of no value whatsoever. </p> <p>\"It will degrade the ethical framework in our society.\"</p>",
  "<p>A five-bedroom house, complete with 9.5 acres of woodland, a two-acre fishing lake and four separate two-bed holiday lodges - one lucky person will win it all for \u00a325. The owners, Brian and Wendy Wilshaw, will be winners too. </p> <p>Last year they were struggling to sell the property, marketed at \u00a3950,000 just as the housing slump took hold. It had few viewings, and no offers. </p> <p>But after launching an online prize competition at the website <a href=\"http://www.winadevonpropertywithfishing.co.uk\">winadevonpropertywithfishing.co.uk</a>, they've sold 34,000 tickets - that's \u00a3850,000 - and are in sight of their 46,000 target.</p> <p>When all the tickets are sold, the Wilshaws will become the first property owners to successfully use a raffle to sell a house - and make a decent profit. Sales of 46,000 tickets will earn them \u00a31.15m - they say the surplus will be used in part to pay the winner's stamp duty and the expenses of running the raffle. But it will still leave them with a handsome return in a property market that virtually everywhere else has gone stone cold.</p> <p>Brian is 64 and finds running a holiday complex too demanding. Wendy says: \"We needed to sell. We're getting old. This place doesn't run itself. The idea of selling tickets kind of evolved. So many of the people who have stayed here have said that if they won the lottery, it's the sort of place they'd buy. It's that that got us thinking.\"</p> <p>The couple have lived at the estate for 14 years and are downsizing. \"I want an ordinary family to live here, people who would never normally be able to afford this place, people who'll be given a chance to start over,\" says Wendy.</p> <p>The winners will get a 2,000 sq ft house and an estate (much of it overgrown) that includes a two-acre lake stocked with carp, tench, roach and other fish that Brian reckons are worth \u00a31,000. Council tax and other basic annual running costs are around \u00a36,000, but in a good year the Wilshaws reckon the timber lodges yield \u00a325,000 income. They've had ticket buyers from Scandinavia, India and the US, and are quietly confident they'll hit the target of 46,000 sold by the December 7 close. The Wilshaws even have emails from people asking for measurements and wanting to know about curtains.</p> <p>But is it legal to sell a home this way? And how can punters be sure this isn't some sort of scam?</p> <p>Wendy pounces on anyone who uses the word raffle or lottery to describe their scheme. \"This isn't a raffle, as it's illegal to have prizes above a certain value. After that it becomes a lottery. And this isn't a lottery either. To be eligible to win, you have to answer a skill-based question. Only if you answer the question correctly do you get to enter.\"</p> <p>The question is: \"What is the cost of an adult full season coarse fishing licence for 2008/2009?\" The answer takes a millisecond to find on Google.</p> <p>It's illegal to run a lottery for personal profit, and while competitions can be run for profit they must involve an element of skill. The Wilshaws' lawyers have advised them the competition meets legal requirements, but Antoinette Jucker, a gambling law expert with Pinsent Masons, is not so sure.</p> <p>\"How do you choose a winner when almost everyone gets the answer right? You take their name out of a hat. That makes it a game of chance, and therefore an illegal lottery. When the Gambling Act was going through parliament, the clear intention was that the only legal lotteries would be those operated for good causes ... This competition is side-stepping that,\" she says.</p> <p>The Wilshaws are adamant their scheme is legal. At one stage online payment group PayPal froze their account while lawyers went through the paperwork, but they gave it the thumbs-up.</p> <p>Others who have tried to raffle their home have been charged by the police. Last year, Angela Jones of Oakenholt, Flintshire, was ordered to pay nearly \u00a38,000 compensation after she admitted breaking lottery laws. She sold tickets at \u00a330 for a chance of winning her \u00a3150,000 three-bed home, but unwittingly fell foul of the Lotteries and Amusement Act 1976. The judge gave her a 12-month conditional discharge.</p> <p>A York man who tried selling 250 tickets at \u00a31,000 for his \u00a3190,000 home backed down after the council wrote to him to tell him it was illegal. But the biggest hurdle is finding punters. A Wiltshire man set up a website to raffle his \u00a3110,000 home in Chippenham at \u00a35 a ticket, but had only 229 takers, so he drew a name from the hat and the winner got \u00a3916 after his 20% costs.</p> <p>The Wilshaws say they'll do the same if they don't reach their target. \"If there isn't a winner by the end of December, then someone gains a cash prize and we start ringing estate agents, simple as that,\" says Wendy. The prize will be the sum they've collected minus 35% to cover expenses. According to some internet chatroom cynics, this is their dream scenario, but the Wilshaws say it is their greatest fear.</p> <p>The most common question they get is how the winning ticket will be selected. \"It will be done by random number software, overseen by our lawyers and in full view of television cameras and reporters,\" says Wendy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ben Steele is producer of a BBC Money Programme report on the Wilshaws to be broadcast in October</p>",
  "<p>Or copper (II) sulphate, the staple of every child's chemistry set and the source of that most wondrous of junior school experiments, growing deep blue crystals from a saturated solution. This week in south-east London, an artist, Roger Hiorns, has taken those classroom memories to a larger scale by sealing and flooding a derelict flat with thousands of litres of copper salt liquid, leaving walls and fittings encrusted as if they were a box of lapis lazuli jewels and its floors a strange maritime sludge. The effect of the artwork, Seizure, is all the stronger because of the artist's lack of control over the processes, the crystals forming in unpredictable patterns as the solution that carried their ingredients cooled. Copper sulphate is a simple compound - easy to manipulate from a pale powder in its dry form to the familiar blue wet pentahydrate salts - and a useful one too, for more than education and art. It helps wine production, controlling mildew in Bordeaux mixture. It keeps water clear of algae; preserves wood; purifies soil; limits the spread of bilharzia; regulates the setting of concrete; colours fireworks green; and is an ingredient in everything from printing ink to hair dye. It is toxic, too - though copper producers take pride in claiming that their metal is safer than many others. Over a century ago this paper regularly reported the price of copper sulphate at Bradford and Liverpool markets to assist mill owners; this week it was reported as art. Either way CuSO4 remains a prince among compounds.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's happiest places have been mapped by scientists, according to the BBC: Edinburgh is the most miserable place in the country, and they were overbrimming with technical details on exactly how miserable we are in each area of Britain. The story struck a chord, and was lifted by journalists throughout the nation, as we cheerfully castigated ourselves. \"Misera-Poole?\" asked the Dorset Echo. \"No smiles in Donny,\" said Doncaster Today. </p> <p>From the Bromley Times, through Bexley, Dartford and Gravesham, to the Hampshire Chronicle, everyone was keen to analyse and explain their ranking. \"Basingstoke lacks any sense of community or heart,\" said Reverend Dr Derek Overfield, industrial chaplain for the area. And so on. </p> <p>Exactly what kind of data is the good reverend explaining there? The Times had some methodological information. \"Researchers at Sheffield and Manchester universities based their findings on more than 5,000 responses from the annual British Household Panel Survey.\" According to the BBC it was presented in a lecture at some geographical society. \"However,\" they said quietly, \"the researchers stress that the variations between different places in Britain are not statistically significant.\" </p> <p>Here, nestled away, halfway through their gushing barrage of data and facts, was an unmarked confession: this entire news story was based on nothing more than random variation. </p> <p>There are many reasons why you might see differences between different areas in your survey data on how miserable people are, and people being differently miserable is only one explanation. There might also be, of course, the play of chance: 5,000 people in 274 areas doesn't give you many in each town - fewer than 20, in fact - so you might just happen to have picked out more miserable people in Edinburgh, and miss the fact that misery is, in fact, uniformly distributed throughout the country. </p> <p>This is called sampling error, and it quietly undermines almost every piece of survey data ever covered in any newspaper. Although the phenomenon has spawned a fiendish area of applied maths called \"statistics\", the basic principles are best understood with a simple game. </p> <p>Dr Deming was a charismatic management guru who railed against performance-related pay on the grounds that it arbitrarily rewarded luck. </p> <p>Working in a theatrical field, he demonstrated his ideas with a simple piece of stagecraft he called The Red Bead Experiment. </p> <p>Deming would appear at management conferences with a big trough containing thousands of beads which were mostly white, but 20% were red. </p> <p>Eight volunteers were then invited up on stage from the audience of management drones: three to be managers, and five to be workers. </p> <p>\"Your job,\" Deming explained solemnly, \"is to make white beads.\" </p> <p>He then produced a paddle with 50 holes cut into it, which was passed to the each worker in turn. They dipped the paddle into the trough, wiggled it around, and tried to produce as many white beads as they could manage, through this entirely random process. </p> <p>\"Go and show the inspectors,\" he would say, sternly. \"Only five red beads, well done!\" </p> <p>\"14 red beads? I think we need to re-evaluate your skill set.\"</p> <p>Workers were sacked, promoted, retrained and redeployed, to great amusement. </p> <p>We ignore basic principles like sampling error at our peril, because the illusion of control, which we all carry around for the sake of sanity, is more powerful than we think, and countless workers have had their lives turned to misery for the simple crime of pulling out 15 red beads. </p> <p>Back in the world of misery, were the journalists blameless, and guilty only of ignorance? For any individual, nobody can tell. </p> <p>But Dr Dimitris Ballas, the academic who did the research, had this to say: \"I tried to explain issues of significance to the journalists who interviewed me. Most did not want to know.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Please send your bad science to <br><a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The profile of cycling in Britain has never been higher, with the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, keen to be involved with the plethora of gold medallists from Beijing and their trainers, plus a welter of gongs and awards in prospect this autumn, an influx of cash from Sky television and the elevation of Chris Hoy, Nicole Cooke and Bradley Wiggins to the status of national treasures.</p> <p>The current version of the Tour of Britain began four years ago on the wave of enthusiasm that followed the medal haul in Athens. The next eight days, as the tour travels from London to Liverpool via Chard and Glasgow, should show whether there has been a trickle-down effect across the country from the team's domination on the track and in the women's road racing in Beijing.</p> <p>Assuming the weather cooperates - and that is a big if, given this sodden early autumn - the crowds can be guaranteed to turn out to welcome the Olympic gold medallists Wiggins and Geraint Thomas. But the biggest test will be the race's perennial bugbear - police cooperation and road safety. Rider protests and hiccups in police traffic control have dogged the event; if the Beijing feel-good factor has indeed trickled down to the motorists who share the roads with the race and the police who marshal them, a true turning point will have been reached.</p> <p>The tour has grown in scale each year, reflected in tomorrow's extended opening stage over several laps of a long London circuit from near Whitehall to Tower Bridge, the expansion of the route to eight days from the original five and in a strong field. There are three home-grown professional squads - backed by Pinarello, Rapha-Condor-Recycling, who include another Beijing medallist in Chris Newton, and Plowman Craven Associates - in addition to a Great Britain selection, made up mainly of riders from the under-23 Olympic Academy.</p> <p>Although last year's winner, France's Romain Feillu, returns - his status enhanced by a day in the maillot jaune of his home tour in July - the British entry is the strongest ever, in spite of the absence of the four-times Tour de France stage-winner Mark Cavendish, who will spend next week at the Tour of Missouri. Wiggins and Thomas may well struggle to adapt from brief track efforts to an eight-dayer, but there are others who will step in.</p> <p>Riding for the Great Britain squad, Ben Swift won the king of the mountains prize in last year's race, has a recent major win under his belt in Italy and is building strongly as the under-23 world championships approach, while the national champion, Rob Hayles, has been a prolific winner this year. \"Riders like Ben are really fired up by this chance to race against the professional teams, Rob is up for it too, the whole team is excited, and the medals won in China just add to it all,\" said the GB road team manager, Max Sciandri.</p> <p>For Pinarello, Russell Downing won a stage and wore the leader's jersey in last week's Tour of Ireland, while Wiggins' Columbia team-mate Roger Hammond won stages in the event in 2005 and 2006. At Barloworld, Thomas may well find himself playing second fiddle to Steve Cummings, who rode strongly in the elite time-trial in Beijing and has two major wins in Italy to his name this year. Those looking for high overall placings will probably have their eyes on Tuesday's leg across Exmoor - decisive last year - and Thursday's stage through the North York Moors.</p> <p>There is only one false note among the general euphoria. This week the organisers had to defend the presence in the race of three cyclists connected to the Operation Puerto blood doping scandal. Tyler Hamilton, Oscar Sevilla and Santiago Botero, who ride for an American team, were named in the police investigation but no proceedings were opened against them. \"It is not the place of the Tour of Britain to make a judgment over teams which are abiding by the rules of the sport,\" said a race spokesman yesterday. \"The team merits a place on the basis of athletic performances and will add to the quality of the racing.\"</p> <p>Hamilton, a stage winner in the 2003 Tour de France, spent the best part of two years in a vain attempt to fight a ban for blood doping and has only recently returned to racing, but, on current form, is a favourite for the yellow jersey. On the London start line tomorrow the trio will be an embarrassing reminder of scandals past, and an annoying distraction from the superb recent deeds of British cycling.</p>",
  "<p>It is not known whether Mike Ashley is a Chrissie Hynde fan but Newcastle United's owner might just identify with the Pretenders' assertion that it is a thin line between love and hate. As Toon Army foot soldiers distraught at Kevin Keegan's departure spoke darkly of declaring \"war\" on the billionaire sports retailer yesterday and suggested it might not be overly safe for him to take a stroll through Newcastle's Bigg Market, Hynde's voice could well have echoed in Ashley's ear.</p> <p>A little bit like Ruud Gullit, Ashley now knows what it is like to feel the heat of Geordie adoration - remember all those dreadlock wigs Newcastle fans once wore in their former Dutch manager's honour - turn to revulsion. While Gullit's crime, which instantly turned a thousand wigs into household mop heads, was to upset Alan Shearer, Ashley has wronged Tyneside's other great sacred cow. Moreover, Newcastle fans regard his perceived crimes against Keegan as far greater than Gullit's dropping of Shearer.</p> <p>Yet if it is no exaggeration to say that the rotund 45-year-old now safely eclipses former Toon villains, including Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and even the widely reviled Freddy Shepherd, in the hate stakes, it was not always like this.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the club's current owner was placed on a pedestal by Newcastle fans and seen as the white knight who not only came charging in to bring Shepherd's chairmanship to a merciful end but bought fans abundant pints. If Shepherd was caricatured as the pantomime baddie, Ashley found himself feted as \"the people's owner\". Soon fans were queueing up to offer reporters gems such as \"He's a reet canny lad\" and \"Mike's so down to earth, he's one of us\" after Ashley waved his wad in night spots such as Blu Bamboo and Buffalo Joes.</p> <p>Geordies cannot be bought quite that cheaply, of course, but Ashley had also dazzled them with an ultimate party trick - he had brought back Kevin Keegan to St James' Park and celebrated it by wearing a \"King Kev No1\" replica shirt up and down the country.</p> <p>Frequently shunning the corporate suits, he apparently relished attending away games with supporters and was even spotted sharing a white transit van with fellow Toon travellers. Any nagging doubts concerning Dennis Wise's puzzling appointment as director of football were pushed to back of the minds of the fans.</p> <p>Granted he was a loaded southerner but no one would have dreamt of likening Ashley to Cockney Wanker of Viz fame. The Tyneside-produced Viz's heyday coincided with Keegan's first managerial incarnation at St James', an era when Sir John Hall's Geordie Nation split its collective sides laughing at the antics of the loud, brazen, fantasist cockney with his wads of cash and unbelievable promises.</p> <p>Unable to keep his pledges about making \"wow\" signings, Ashley has left some Newcastle fans suspecting he has played them for fools. Frank Gilmour of the Independent Newcastle United Supporters Club summed up the mood. \"There is no way Ashley will be able to sit with the fans anymore, I am not even sure he will be able to go into St James' Park again,\" he said. \"There is going to be a huge reaction and many fans are already talking about not going.\" Similarly Steve Wraith, editor of the fanzine Players Inc, reflected: \"I think Ashley has underestimated people's feelings about Keegan.\"</p> <p>The True Faith website yesterday featured an item titled War - The Call Up? alongside an image of a gun-toting soldier. In an editorial-type address it advocated a non-violent, economic boycott of all things Ashley-related: \"There's a mood for action. Action where Ashley will feel it most. We might have to hurt the thing we love to get at him and his people. That is the dilemma but many of us are up for being part of an organised struggle.\"</p> <p>The influential nufc.com summed up the mood as veering away from boycotting next Saturday's home game against Hull City while resolving not to buy club merchandise or patronise St James' Park's food and beverage outlets including Shearer's bar. Its postings also reflected a widespread desire among fans to shun Ashley's retail outlets, including Sports Direct and Lillywhites.</p> <p>So far so militant but, as Hynde sang, it really can be a thin line. Generous, extrovert and rarely understated, Geordies have long harboured a weakness for blingy, big-name glamour and Ashley's sole, albeit minuscule, hope of pacifying them appears to be somehow serving up a charismatic new coach whom it would seem churlish to boo. Gianfranco Zola anyone?</p> <h2>How the fans can hurt owner and sidekick</h2> <p>All newsagents in the vicinity of St James' Park to place confectionery on the adult entertainment shelf to prevent Dennis Wise getting his daily chocolate fix</p> <p>All children under the age of five to be equipped with platform shoes so even they tower over the diminutive executive director (football)</p> <p>Take Mike Ashley at his word and ensure all future pints of lager served to him in the Bigg Market and Quayside are of the non-alcoholic variety to give him time to consider his actions in the harsh light of perpetual sobriety</p> <p>Entice Ashley, Wise, Tony Jimenez and Jeff Vetere into the St James' Park trophy room and lock the key. Not only will there be ample space for them in there, no one will have any reason to go in and find them for the next few decades</p> <p>Having listened to the fans he drank with and entertained their most extreme fantasy by appointing Kevin Keegan back in January, lure Ashley down the pub and tell him the only way he can make amends is by hiring Ossie Ardiles for a second spell. Within months kamikaze defending will secure relegation and one thoroughly devalued investment</p> <p>Hit Ashley in the pocket by boycotting games and eschewing all branded sportswear from his outlets. They can show their allegiance instead by carrying other black and white objects: cuddly penguins, humbugs, the album Parallel Lines by Blondie, zebras, those sickly mint-flavoured Liquorice Allsorts, Breton smocks and sticks of Whitley Bay rock</p>",
  "<p>Leeds ended their league campaign with a hard-earned win last night, but have a major disciplinary worry ahead of the play-offs after their New Zealand full-back Brent Webb was put on report for a high tackle on Wakefield's Danny Brough.</p> <p>The 14th-minute incident will be studied by the Rugby Football League's video review panel on Monday leaving Webb in danger of a suspension that would rule him out of the qualifying semi-final at St Helens on Friday week. The Rhinos came into the game with a mathematical chance of overhauling Saints to finish top, but it was obvious from the start that whatever happened at Knowsley Road, a Wakefield team who theoretically had nothing to play for would offer far too much resistance to allow Leeds to give the necessary boost to their points difference.</p> <p>This was a proper Yorkshire derby, and in the balance at 12-12 until Leeds took control in the last 20 minutes, with Ali Lauitiiti scoring two tries and laying on another for Kevin Sinfield.</p> <p>Leeds responded to an early Danny Brough try with a slick combination between Webb and Lauitiiti for Jordan Tansey to score. But Wakefield responded by surging into a 12-6 lead through two well-taken tries by their classy full-back Scott Grix, and it took a brilliant individual effort from Scott Donald to bring the Rhinos level at half-time.</p> <p>Brough missed a chance to regain the lead for Trinity, dragging a penalty wide in first-half stoppage time, and the scores remained level throughout a fiercely contested third quarter but Sinfield grabbed the crucial score in the 62nd minute after his own high kick had rebounded to Lauitiiti off Grix's shoulder.</p> <p><strong>Wakefield Trinity</strong> Grix; Blanch, Martin, Atkins, Petersen; Rooney, Brough; Watene, Drew, Bibey, MacGillivray, Golden, Demetriou. <br><strong>Interchange</strong> Sculthorpe, K Henderson, Wilkes, Leo-Latu. </p> <p><strong>Leeds Rhinos</strong> Webb; Smith, Ablett, Senior, Donald; McGuire, Burrow; Scruton, Tansey, Peacock, Lauitiiti, Ellis, Sinfield. <br><strong>Interchange</strong> Jones-Buchanan, Bailey, Kirke, Burgess. </p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> S Ganson (St Helens).</p>",
  "<p>Martin Corry starts his final season as a player with no idea what he will do when he peels off his Leicester jersey for the last time. He is adamant, though, that he will not be following his former England and Tigers' team-mate Austin Healey on to Strictly Come Dancing.</p> <p>\"I will never appear on that show,\" said Corry. \"It may be big money, but with that comes big embarrassment. I saw Austin the other day and we had a 30-minute conversation about the finer points of ballroom dancing and the technical difference between the tango and the jive. I left wondering how, after training my guts off and sweating, I could end up talking about that. I look forward to playing a game, going home, cracking open a beer and watching Austin on television. That's as far as it will go for me.\"</p> <p>Corry, who won 64 England caps and appeared in six Tests for the Lions, is one of the last of a dying breed in the Premiership, a player who made his debut in the amateur era. He started at Newcastle Gosforth, as the Falcons were then called, before moving to Bristol in the summer that the game turned professional. He captained the club before joining Leicester in 1997 and, turning 35 next month, his 14th season will be his last.</p> <p>\"I don't want to think about what I will do when my career as a player is over,\" said Corry. \"I can't leave the game I love, but should I take some time out before coming back or start coaching at under-eight level? I will have to do something outside rugby and have had some work experience in recent years, but I've had a 10-out-of-10 job for the last 14 years and it would be difficult going to one where you did not love all of it. I'm greedy and want to have it all. I guess I am in a state of denial. I am not looking at it as my final season.\"</p> <p>Leicester's Premiership campaign opens tomorrow at Gloucester, the scene of their play-off victory last May on an afternoon which was a triumph for Leicester grit and determination after being outplayed for long periods. The Tigers finished the season empty-handed, sacked their head coach Marcelo Loffreda and lost Neil Back to Leeds before appointing the South African Heyneke Meyer to take over.</p> <p>\"We had bloody-mindedness at Gloucester in the play-off but very little else,\" said Corry, who will be absent tomorrow because of a groin strain. \"The result was all-important, but I would like to think we have developed as a team and can play a lot more rugby. There were reasons, excuses and false reasons for what happened last season. It is hard to distinguish between all of them, but we are a club that wants to set the mark across the board. Everyone was responsible for our failure last year: we have left it behind and learned from it.</p> <p>\"Heyneke has brought a buzz with him. He may come from a different environment, but he can relate to the Leicester culture and he appreciates the values we have. He wants us to expand and develop a different skill-set. He wants to add to the Leicester spirit, not dilute it - and you have to get it spot-on in the Premiership because there is no weak side.\"</p> <p>Corry retired from international rugby after last season's World Cup. He was part of the squad in Australia in 2003 which lifted the Webb Ellis Trophy, and although failure quickly followed, he was one of the few England players who enhanced his reputation. While not relishing the day when he will be known as an ex-player, he is concerned at the impact the experimental law variations will have on the game.</p> <p>\"It is going to take a month for referees and players to know where they stand,\" said Corry. \"No one wants to see a game where there is a penalty or a free-kick at every breakdown. Penalties are potentially game-winning or -losing and should not be awarded lightly. The fine-tuning variations I can take, but it is the big changes - the lineout, the pulling down of the maul and the directives on the tackle - that are going to have a major influence on the game and I fear they will lead to a lot more kicking. Is that what the rules are designed to achieve?\"</p>",
  "<p>Does Iraq have a new strongman? Is the mild-mannered Nouri al-Maliki becoming intoxicated with the power born from the high price of oil and the increase in stability in key areas of the country? Certainly US \"officials\" think so \u2013 with unnamed sources <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/51167.html\">telling reporters</a> that Maliki's tough talk on the timeline for US forces leaving the country is both na\u00efve and dangerous.</p> <p>So how has this situation come to pass and how are things likely to develop? Is Maliki going to detach from his perceived political masters in Washington and be allowed to show independence? Or will such posturing result in Maliki suffering a similar fate to his predecessor, who was replaced when he became too independent? </p> <p>Maliki's story both before and during his time as prime minister is fascinating at a political and personal level. In 2003, after 23 years spent in Iran and Syria (Washington take note) he returned to Iraq and in 2006 replaced Da'wa party leader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_al-Jaafari\">Ibrahim al-Jaafari</a> who was seen as too independent by the Americans. Later that year, 26 years after Saddam sentenced him to death, Maliki returned the favour by signing the death warrant that sent Saddam to the gallows. </p> <p>However, Jaafari's replacement by Maliki indicated that although the Iraqi government had been given nominal sovereignty, the leash on its leader's power would be both curtailed and monitored by the Americans. Bob Woodward's latest book on Iraq <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080905/pl_afp/usiraqspymilitary_080905075226;_ylt=AuOQ4wvOL0Nir_9cseZ6BrpX6GMA\">confirmed</a> the extensive US surveillance of Maliki himself (\"We know everything he says,\" according to one source cited by Woodward) but also of his staff and and others in the government.<br>It might be argued that Maliki inherited the hardest job in world politics. The weakness of his early premiership was clear; he ran a government of little unity whose power was limited to control over only the US-defended Green Zone. His US patrons had various and inconsistent visions for Iraq, as did his old friends in Tehran and Damascus. In addition Iraq's civil war was <a href=\"http://www.iraqbodycount.org/\">at its most violent</a> as he took charge.<br>In the face of worsening sectarian violence, Maliki was seen initially as a Shia first and an Iraqi second. Critics accused him of tolerating Shia death squads and only targeting Sunni neighbourhoods. But what difference a year can make! By 2007 and the beginning of the surge (defined not only by an increase in US troop levels but by Washington's acceptance of pragmatic realism) Maliki began to assert himself. The end of the US policy of not talking to the insurgency allowed for the cooption of Sunnis into the political process and gave Maliki some political space to breathe.<br>However, political progress over the oil law, Kirkuk, federalism, national reconciliation and local elections has been painfully slow. Meawhile, Maliki has embarked on a series of military offensives \u2013 first in Mosul in January, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/26/AR2008032600643.html\">Basra in March</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/world/middleeast/21baghdad.html?hp\">into Sadr city</a> in May. Maliki is now looking to upgrade Iraq's armed forces with the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080905/ts_nm/lockheedmartin_dc_1;_ylt=AsIifdB4eOZiQhiOwHJ6W59X6GMA\">purchase</a> of 36 F-16s from the US as he completes his transition from an exile with a price on his head to Iraq's new strongman. <br>Following the Basra operation during which British military support was criticised as lacking, Maliki was reported to have shunned British diplomatic officials who were previously granted close access. More recently Maliki has embarrassed US officials such as David Satterfield, by stubbornly <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080903/wl_mideast_afp/iraqusmilitary_080903133002\">refusing to sign</a> a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) without a clear timetable for US troop withdrawal \u2013 something that President Bush rejected for five years before finally accepting it according to Iraqi negotiators.</p> <p>So will the Americans clip Maliki's wings or let him fly? It seems unlikely that the US would want its heavy political investment in \"good news from Iraq\" to go to waste over a messy replacement of Iraq's premier. Of greater concern to Maliki is the support he outlined for Obama's Iraq policy, which may lead to problems if McCain gets in, as the Republican's obsession over Iraq seemingly allows for little input from the Iraqis themselves.</p>",
  "<p>If a home insulation programme is the best Gordon Brown can come up with to deal with runaway gas and electricity prices, he can expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/05/economy.gordonbrown\">a rough ride</a> from the Trades Union Congress in Brighton next week. After all the talk of government relaunches and economic recovery programmes, it looks like extra lagging for the fuel poor is the best he can come up with.</p> <p>That certainly seemed to be the message from the prime minister's pledge to the Scottish CBI on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/05/gordonbrown.economy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=society\">to turn his back on \"short-term giveaways\"</a>. So out goes the plan for fuel vouchers to the worst off, it seems, as well as the widely-backed idea of a windfall tax on the energy companies to pay for them.</p> <p>Clearly confident about seeing off a compulsory levy, the power firms refused to play ball on a voluntary handout either - while the European Commission seems to have blocked the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4670604.ece\">fallback plan</a> to sell off more carbon emission permits. </p> <p>One senior trade unionist yesterday called Brown's failure to force the hand of the profit-rich energy giants a \"gutless climbdown\".</p> <p>Not that the prime minister is actually expected to speak directly to TUC delegates - that job is currently being left to his hapless chancellor, Alistair Darling - but Brown is planning to meet union leaders in Brighton in private. And although most have recently balked at any move against the prime minister, mainly for fear of getting David Miliband instead, the events of the past few days have started to shift opinion.</p> <p>The price now being paid by trade union members for the growing economic squeeze will dominate debates in Brighton: unions are united in wanting government action to boost growth, shift the burden of taxation on to the higher paid, halt the squeeze on public sector pay and repeal Thatcher-era restrictions of trade union freedoms.</p> <p>Against a background of growing industrial action, that is bound to be talked up in parts of the media as a threat of another <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent\">\"winter of discontent\"</a> - as the mass strikes over public sector pay 30 years ago came to be known. Such comparisons are still off the scale.</p> <p>So is the level of attention being lavished on a motion from the angry <a href=\"http://www.poauk.org.uk/\">Prison Officers' Association</a>, which is banned from taking industrial action, calling for \"one-day general strikes\" against anti-union laws. The motion stands no chance of being passed and no such walkouts are on the cards.</p> <p>What is certain, however, is that there will be more strikes across the public sector among workers faced with a government 2% pay policy when inflation is running at 5%. TUC delegates are set to back calls for coordinated industrial action against continuing real-terms cuts in public sector pay. When the living standards of low-paid workers and core Labour voters are being hit both by pay restraint and escalating fuel and food costs, something's got to give.</p>",

  "<p>When gnarled former PoW John Sidney McCain III announced Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate, we were introduced to a new and instantly ubiquitous phrase - \"hockey mom\".</p> <p>Oh sure, those two words have probably been co-joined millions of times before. \"Can you drive me to hockey, mom?\" for instance. It's not like we're talking <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=spell&amp;resnum=0&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=1&amp;q=%22shove-ha%27penny+daschund%22&amp;sp\">\"shove-ha'penny\" and \"daschund\"</a> here.</p> <p>But this was something new. This was a cold-bloodedly deliberate attempt at political branding. Palin referred to herself a hockey mom in her carefully scripted and vetted acceptance speech - and not for the first time. In 2004 she boasted: \"It's said the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. So with lipstick on, the gloves come off.\"</p> <p>This is a deliberate political coinage. The question being, why? And how exactly does a hockey mom differ from a <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DF1F31F933A15753C1A960958260\">soccer mom</a> (a phrase that's been around since at least 1983 but became a political clich\u00e9 during the 1996 presidential election when it was widely used to describe <a href=\"http://everything2.com/title/soccer%2520mom\">suburban white women who voted for Bill Clinton</a>).</p> <p>Philadelphia Weekly writer and hardcore soccerphobe Brian McManus thinks there is no difference. Soccer and hockey moms are the \"same exact thing, only she's from Alaska and they don't play soccer there. They play hockey.\" His colleague Dan McQuade agrees: \"It's too fucking cold to play soccer in Alaska.\"</p> <p>But extensive research - by which I mean <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=soccer+alaska&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=\">typing the words \"soccer\" and 'Alaska\" into Google</a> - revealed this assumption to be utter rubbish.</p> <p>So given that in Alaska soccer moms outnumber both the timber wolf and the caribou - what message was Palin trying to send by twisting the stereotype?</p> <p>\"A hockey mom is more American,\" says Philadelphia columnist Liz Spikol. \"A lot of Americans are suspicious of soccer, and still believe it connotes the foreign. Whereas hockey is as GOP-North American as a fetus on posterboard.\"</p> <p>She has a point. The soccer mom has mutated out of her political pigeonhole. In the lexicon of hipsters looking for an easy bourgeois icon to bash, the soccer mom has become an SUV-driving, road-hogging, sweatpants-wearing, latte-sipping, brat-spewing, strip mall-shopping, suburban folk devil.</p> <p>To others she's become lazy shorthand for white, middle-class heteronormativity. In the hit TV series Weeds the suburban drug dealer heroine is repeatedly referred to as a soccer mom - despite the fact that, when seen at her son's game in the first episode, she clearly believes that a match is comprised of four quarters.</p> <p>So why has the Republican candidate for vice-president worked so hard at branding herself with the hockey mom label? Of course it might simply be that she's genuinely immersed in ice-hockey culture. The thug who impregnated her 17-year-old daughter (and who <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5044198/field-guide-levi-johnston\">described himself as \"a fucking redneck\" on his MySpace page</a>) certainly is.</p> <p>\"I live to play hockey,\" he writes. 'Ya fuck with me I'll kick [your] ass'\"</p> <p>And there, I think - in a sweary nutshell - is the reason Palin is so keen to be seen as a hockey mom. In the minds of the effete conservative elite who run the Republican party, the hockey-playing yob who got Palin's daughter pregnant represents an idealised form of American masculinity - unthinking, brutish, willfully ignorant, easy to manipulate, unquestioningly patriotic, proudly reactionary, quick to respond to any perceived threat with overwhelming violence - and very unlikely to ever vote Democrat. Or - by extension - play soccer.</p> <p>For the weird truth is that while <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2199361/\">millions more Americans play and watch soccer than play and watch hockey</a>, millions of Americans stills see hockey as the more American sport.</p> <p>In the big cities - especially in California and the liberal north-east - soccer shirts now outnumber all other sports related streets wear gear (on non-match days, at least). In Philadelphia - a city that prides itself on its gritty, down-to-earth, parochial fan culture - a stroll around Center City on any Saturday afternoon shows evidence of the massive inroads cosmopolitan soccer culture has made into the American psyche. And it isn't just the shirts, or the soccer decals on every other car-arse. Soccer is everywhere in popular culture - the default choice whenever a movie or TV show needs a scene set at a sports event.</p> <p>But there remains a brutish, ignorant, xenophobic rump who regard soccer as effete, foreign and profoundly anti-American. And they are of course overwhelmingly attracted to the Republican party. For these die-hards soccer is emblematic of an imagined anti-American liberal (and, whisper it, Jewish) enemy-within out to undermine \"real\" American culture.</p> <p>And then there's the sport of ice hockey. Despite the fact that in both ice-hockey and soccer one of the most eagerly anticipated scenes is that of players slapping at each other ineffectually (ice hockey players because they're wearing pads and skates, the soccer players because all their muscles are in their legs and, besides, they've done nothing but play soccer since they were five and so never learned to fight properly), in the minds of what passes for the Republican intelligentsia, the two sports are worlds apart. Hockey is unpretentious, hardscrabble, working class and white. While soccer is French and gay.</p> <p>In the TV series Rescue Me - about unashamedly macho firefighters coming to terms with both post-9-11 trauma and their role in an increasingly feminised America, Dennis O'Leary and his super tough buddies are amateur ice hockey players. Of course they are. Had they been soccer players, at least a third of Americans would have been confused.</p> <p>Waidaminnit, what are they saying here? That 9-11 turned these guys gay?</p> <p>Of course, Palin misreads and underestimates both America and Americans; Republicans always do. On the train home from Philly today the three seats in front of me were filled with teenage field-hockey players - just part of the latest generation of women freed from spectating and cheerleading by America's awesome equality-of-sports-funding legislation, Title IX.</p> <p>There are conservative Americans who would no doubt find these confident, cocky, assertive teenagers un-womanly and uncouth (and some conservative readers of this blog too. I'm thinking particularly of the reader who described <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=vid&amp;id=1110515\">Philadelphia's amazing female \"alleycat\" bike racers</a> as \"<a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/07/28/allgirl_alleycat_racing_could.html\">extremely unattractive, damaged, self-hating, aggressive femiNazis/lesbians</a>.\")</p> <p>But they're crazy and wrong. These women look empowered, relaxed, athletic and totally in control. And they're America's next crop of young female voters. Not soccer moms. Not hockey moms. But players.</p>",
  "<p>The media verdict on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/uselections2008.johnmccain2\">John McCain's acceptance speech</a> is that the Republican presidential nominee is a narcolepsy-inducing contortionist.</p> <p>At the biggest moment of his political career, he delivered a flat, stupefyingly boring address that drained away all the excitement generated by Sarah Palin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/sarah.palin.speech\">pit-bull-with-lipstick performance</a> the night before. His central message - that it's time to clean up Washington - was incoherent. Yes, McCain has some legitimate reformist credentials. But he's also a 25-year Washington insider who marches in lockstep with George Bush on such issues as the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthy.</p> <p>\"It really is an audacious ploy, to tell people that the country's got to correct the mistakes made by a political party when that's the very party you represent,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090500121.html?hpid=topnews\">writes Tom Shales</a> in today's Washington Post. \"It's like staging a revolution against yourself - saying that the Republicans have got to go so the Republicans can move in and clean up the mess.\"</p> <p>Last Friday there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.media?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=global\">no shortage of punditry</a> to sift through following Barack Obama's speech. Today the offerings are comparatively light and perfunctory. The bloviators still want to bloviate about Palin's speech, which electrified the convention-centre crowd, if not necessarily the public at large.</p> <p>\"For all the hullabaloo about whether John McCain would match Sarah Palin's performance at the Republican convention, it wasn't even close,\" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-heilbrunn/mccain-fails-to-deliver-a_b_124112.html\">observes Jacob Heilbrunn</a> in the Huffington Post. He adds that \"most of his speech was a snooze, delivered in the tone of a kindly old uncle reminiscing about World War II before fretting about how those pesky Russians are stirring up trouble again.\"</p> <p>Writing in Slate, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/09/05/post-palin-depression.aspx\">Christopher Beam attributes</a> the live audience's \"tepid reaction\" to \"post-Palin depression\".</p> <p>And in the Boston Phoenix, <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/dontquoteme/archive/2008/09/04/mccain-s-speech-quite-a-comedown.aspx\">Adam Reilly offers</a> a telling (if unimaginable) hypothetical: \"Suppose Sarah Palin had somehow ended up as the Republican presidential nominee this year. Suppose she'd picked John McCain as her running mate. And suppose he'd given the speech he did tonight. You know what people would be saying? 'Crap. She should have gone with Giuliani'.\"</p> <p>Incredibly, McCain's handlers even managed to reprise the <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213806.php\">widely mocked green background</a> that punctuated his dreadful speech on the night that Obama clinched the Democratic nomination. But colour coordination wasn't the main problem then, and it wasn't last night, either.</p> <p>Damning with extraordinarily faint praise is the order of the day at the conservative National Review. \"The eloquent absence of eloquence\" is the headline on <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzAyYmRiNTA5YzQ0ZTJhNDlkMTIwNjczMGNlNDgzMWE=\">Peter Robinson's reaction piece</a>. In a, shall we say, counterintuitive bit of speech analysis, <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzdjZWJjYjI0ZDk0MzkzYzJjMDY0OWNiMzc1MjZkNzQ=\">Rich Lowry instructs us</a>: \"Don't focus on the oratory. ...

Maybe not. But McCain's speech certainly did not help the Republicans' already precarious standing. The new star of the party is the deeply flawed Palin. McCain's brain trust is desperately trying to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13143.html\">smear the media</a> for smearing the Palin family, but the truth is that most of the press clippings, including those about 17-year-old Bristol Palin's pregnancy, have been exceedingly kind.</p> <p>The real focus of media inquiry has been on more-substantive issues: the bipartisan investigation into whether Palin <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303210.html?hpid=artslot\">abused her office</a> by firing the public-safety commissioner for refusing to get rid of her ex-brother-in-law; her <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/sarahpalin/story/511471.html\">selective memory</a> about the \"bridge to nowhere\"; her association with the <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/09/members-of-frin.html\">Alaskan Independence party</a>, whose founder <a href=\"http://www.akip.org/introduction.html\">proclaimed</a> that he had \"no use for America or her damned institutions\"; and her anti-science positions on such matters as <a href=\"http://dwb.adn.com/news/politics/elections/story/8347904p-8243554c.html\">creationism</a> and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12995.html\">global warming</a>.</p> <p>Palin may have aroused the base, but she'll likely prove to be a drag on the ticket among the independents and conservative Democrats whom McCain needs to win.</p> <p>Most pundits did give McCain decent marks for retelling the story of his captivity in Vietnam. But here, too, he managed to step on his own moment. By letting virtually every surrogate this week speak about McCain's POW experience in dramatic, hushed tones, McCain allowed it to be robbed of much of its power before he finally got to talk about it himself.</p> <p>The most positive assessment of the speech I could find is by <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/09/05/rnc_thurs/\">Walter Shapiro, writing in Salon</a>. Though conceding that McCain fell well short of Obama's and Palin's performances, Shapiro says: \"McCain may have found the right words to appeal to the voters he needs to win, especially an older generation in hard-pressed normally Democratic industrial states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\"</p> <p>Well, perhaps. But in the immediate aftermath, I think most observers are going to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/04/john-mccain-speech-reacti_n_124115.html\">agree instead with Jeffrey Toobin</a>, who on CNN last night called it \"the worst speech by a nominee that I've heard since Jimmy Carter in 1980\" - \"disorganised, themeless ... [and] shockingly bad.\"</p>",

  "<p>Barbara Dawson, director of the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin, remembers very clearly the day in 1997 when she climbed the steep stairs and entered Francis Bacon's studio at 7 Reece Mews, South Kensington. It had been left the way it was when he died, on April 28 1992, and it was a chaos of slashed canvases, paint-splashed walls, cloths, brushes, champagne boxes, a large mirror. She stood and stared for a long time, in a kind of incredulity, \"and actually it became quite beautiful.\" She began to see \"paths cut through it,\" and details. \"The last unfinished painting was on the easel when I went in there, and on the floor underneath the easel was a short article on George Michael, from Wham, about how he liked to be photographed from one side. It was like looking into somebody's mind.\" </p> <p>Bacon was quite particular, and a little perverse, about where he lived and worked. 7 Reece Mews was tiny, and apart from the studio consisted of two rooms - a kitchen that contained a bath, and a living room that doubled as a bedroom. The studio had one skylight, and he usually worked there in the mornings. He tried to paint elsewhere - in South Africa, for example, when he was visiting family, but couldn't. (Too much light, was the rather surprising objection.) He liked the size and general frugality, too.</p> <p>Chris Stephens, co-curator of the Tate's major retrospective this month, remembers Bacon's doctor once telling him that sometime in the 80s, by which time Bacon had been famous and wealthy for a good few years, he bought a flat around the corner. He wanted \"to live more comfortably\", he tells me, \"but he just couldn't bear it - he just ended going back to the one room flat with a kitchen.\" </p> <p>Dawson notes a story told by poet and writer Anthony Cronin in his essay An Irish Fear of Death? (collected in Francis Bacon in Dublin), which might explain why he might have been more comfortable in small, dark spaces: \"Perhaps the most revealing story I personally remember him telling about his early childhood in Ireland concerned a maid or a nanny - I had the impression of a sort of Irish mother's help - who was left in charge of him for long periods when his parents were absent from the house. She had a soldier boyfriend who came visiting at these times; and of course, the couple wanted to be alone. But Francis was a jealous and endlessly demanding little boy who would constantly interrupt their lovemaking on one pretext or another. As a result, she took to locking him in a cupboard at the top of the stairs when her boyfriend arrived. Confined in the darkness of this cupboard Francis would scream - perhaps for several hours at a time - but since he was out of earshot of the happy courting couple, completely in vain.\" \"That cupboard,\" Bacon apparently said years later, \"was the making of me.\" </p> <p>Dawson recognised that the studio was the making of Bacon's art in a more profound sense than just being a comfortable space to paint in, and determined that it should not be dismantled. John Edwards, to whom Bacon had left Reece Mews, felt similarly, and after months of painstaking cataloguing by archaeologists, conservators and photographers - they recorded the exact position of everything - the Hugh Lane Gallery took delivery of the studio, in toto, in 1998. It was opened to the public in 2001. </p> <p>What is visible now, in a climate-controlled corner of the gallery, a gracious neo-classical building on Parnell Square in Dublin, is in fact a kind of faithful \"skin\" of objects; the tables and chairs have all been returned to their original places, the work surfaces seem as cluttered as they were - but the deep stuff, the bedrock, has been removed and is kept in climate-controlled archival areas. In the end, there were 7,500 items - 2,000 samples of painting materials, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvasses, umpteen handwritten notes, drawings, books, champagne boxes, corduroy trousers (he ripped them up and used the cloth to achieve his distinctive paint textures) \u2026 it took two years to compile a database of all of it, for the delectation of Bacon scholars in perpetuity</p> <p>Dawson and Stephens are both careful to insist that it would be a mistake to draw too many direct inferences between what was found there and finished canvasses - a muddy thumbprint on a photograph could mean only that he picked it up, not necessarily that he worked from it. Bacon may himself have often said things like \"this mess is rather like my mind; it may be a good image of what goes on inside me\" - but he had a well-developed sense of personal mythology and of what critics might want to hear; in the end the story is a bit of both - the studio is immensely revealing, and sometimes not revealing at all. </p> <p>Take the triptychs, beginning with Study for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), which Bacon liked people to think began his career. They are big, generally 6'6\" by 4'6\" (198cm x 137cm), completely out of proportion to the size of the room in which they were made. The dingy room at Reece Mews (far dingier that Perry Ogden's beautiful photographs might suggest), could probably hold only one full triptych, and then only if almost everything else was moved out of it. Does that mean he never saw triptychs together until they were displayed in a gallery? Then again, Stephens points out, if you look at their specific composition, there is almost always a tightly focused figure in the middle of what is often effectively a flat background. \"He puts the figure in the centre, and all he draws in is the figure, and they're nearly always the same scale, so even when you move from a small canvas to a big canvas, the small canvasses are just heads. And there tends to be a relationship of where they are in the canvas. It depends how you hang it, but you feel as though there's eye-to-eye contact.\" </p> <p>You could almost argue that the clarity, the clear, emotional force that so many people respond to in Bacon - all those heads, screaming or not, where the eyes are obscured in favour of what feels like the flayed and naked contents of a mind - was in some ways aided by the closeness of his surroundings. \"The context tends to be filled in afterwards. I mean, it changes over time, actually, but you do feel that it's almost the bit he struggles with most, is how to contextualise the figure.\" You could also start reading themes of enclosure, of entrapment, into the box-like lines that occur in so many of the paintings, and extend that to an effect of working in such a small space - and that may or may not be right. </p> <p>Much more fertile - though similarly complicated - is the issue of source material. Cappock writes in her book on the studio that Bacon gave up using sitters early, because it inhibited him \u2013 he was much more comfortable working from paintings and from photographs, either those he found, or those he had commissioned. John Deakin's photos of Bacon's lover George Dyer, of Isabel Rawsthorne, of Henrietta Moraes, were all found in the studio, and all resulted in major work. Sometimes the relationship is relatively direct - Velazquez's Pope Innocent X becoming the 1953 Study after Velazquez, for example, or the recurring images of Dyer, whom Bacon bullied and scorned in life, but whose suicide resulted in some of his greatest, and - as John Maybury attempted to show in his 1998 film about Bacon, Love is the Devil - most tender work. But even these were often amalgamated with aspects of other photographs, other images: the screaming mouth of the nurse in Battleship Potemkin, for example (though Bacon also cited a wailing mother in Poussin's Massacre of the Innocents at Chantilly), interpreting Velazquez's dour Innocent X (which, incidentally, he seems never to have seen in person); Eadweard Muybridge's wrestlers providing both a way for figures to lie coupling on a bed, and a feeling, as Stephens puts it, of being \"isolated and frozen in time\".</p> <p>Less direct, but no less important, is the sense in which Bacon was simply amassing images as if they were compost, the sediment out of which paintings might grow. Sometimes this was quite literal. \"My photographs are very damaged by people walking over them and crumpling them and everything else,\" he once told the critic David Sylvester, \"and this does add other implications to an image of Rembrandt's, for instance, which are not Rembrandt's.\" The 1,500 photographs in the studio, and some of the 570 books, included images of shattered limbs (French propaganda photographs from the Algerian war); crowds under fire; assassinations (Kennedy's was a favourite); medical imagery (diseased gums, a colour atlas of forensic pathology, diagrams of recommended positioning for radiography). </p> <p>\"The thing was\", Stephens says, \"he didn't necessarily paint any of those - and yet he's sort of trying to get that <em>feeling</em>, that tension and apprehension, in his own images. There's a sense that just by owning images they somehow infected him.\" At the same time as he was absorbing, and cannibalising, and taking what he wanted out of photographs - sometimes physically; he was not shy about ripping them up (even if they were by Cartier-Bresson), safety-pinning sections of two different photographs together to get an effect he liked, drawing all over them - he was attempting to transcend them, because photography made the business of figurative painting so complicated. \"Everything he does is negotiating that,\" says Stephens. \"How you do figurative painting in the age of photography?\"</p> <p>Unlike the rest of his flat, the studio was a private place. Entry was by invitation only, though, as Dawson points out, he did like having people back there late at night, drinking champagne and discussing his latest work. Looking at the mess, it can be hard to imagine that this was anything less that a transparent vision of the way he worked - but that was not entirely the case. Trace back the ways in which Bacon, and particularly Bacon's sources, are generally described, and it is striking how many of them originated with him. He used transparency as a foil: his articulacy about his own work, in interview after interview, set the terms of reference, and thus obscured the things he chose not to say.</p> <p>One of his favourite self-mythologies, for example, was that he didn't draw, didn't make sketches before he began to paint. You can see why he might want to give an impression of emotion splashed directly onto canvas, the age-old Romantic idea of inspiration ushered directly into art, but in fact it wasn't entirely true. Forty-one works on paper were found in the studio, as well as sketches hidden in the end papers of books. In his last publication on Bacon, in fact, eight years after his death, Sylvester called drawing Bacon's \"secret vice.\" </p> <p>Then there's the story - hearsay, Dawson insists - that whips were found among the detritus. It is fairly well-known that Bacon had masochistic tendencies, but out of what seems to be a fear that the colourful life might overshadow the art, Dawson prefers to play it down. When I ask what the oddest thing they found was, she laughs and starts talking about a book on ectoplasmic phenomena that seems to have contributed to Bacon's interest, in the early 50s, in the effect of a figure materialising within a curtain. Which is interesting, but not quite what I asked about. Surely his sexual predilections, his interest in violence, are an integral part of the man, and thus a part of the work - the beds like racks, the screaming men so physically intimating mental pain? </p> <p>Bacon was homosexual at a time when it was still illegal, and while he was open about his sexuality, his notes for prospective paintings refer to \"bed[s] of crime]\", and \"his homosexuality was felt as an affliction,\" says Dawson. \"While his family were more supportive than might have been appreciated, it certainly wasn't easy.\" \"The sense of guilt,\" adds Stephens, \"is in the work.\" Masochism, he feels, gives an extra dimension to Bacon's fascination with violence. \"His collections of pictures, of dead bodies, or depictions of violence - he's not looking at violence from the classic liberal position.\" And the masochistic streak, concedes Dawson, was accompanied by intellectual rigour, and an insistent attempt at objectivity - \"he's trying to detach from himself as well. 'Oh, you hit me. What kind of a sensation is that?'\"</p> <p>Everything was grist, and in his studio even his own art fed other art. As Cappock points out, he returned to his own work obsessively, repeating and augmenting. The first Dyer triptychs happened fast, within a week after Dyer's death in October 1971, and then in the following summer and spring; the Tate owns a Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion painted 44 years after the first one. And of course, he responded negatively - and violently \u2014 as well as positively; a hundred is a lot of slashed canvasses to keep around you when you're working, especially when they are so deliberately slashed. Every small defaced canvas was literally so - the faces were cut out. Which might, in a way, serve as a metaphor for the importance of our understanding of his studio as a whole.</p> <p>We can see all the peripheral stimuli, the basis for the work, but with him died the unifying mind, the place where everything came together, into what he himself called, in a 1985 interview with Melvyn Bragg, \"images which are a concentration of reality, and a shorthand of sensation.\"</p>",

Minimising waste, in fact, will be sensible; we'll reuse and recycle because it'll often be preferable to buying to buy new.</p> <p>In computing, there are important trends that are only just starting. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/28/olpc.linux\">rise of ultraportables (or Liliputers)</a> \u2013 really small yet fully functional computers, with solid-state drives \u2013 is a key trend. This will bring Linux to a wider market that would never have used it before. </p> <p>Mobile phones are becoming even more important; their penetration is a key indicator of economic growth in developing countries. They'll become portable internet devices for the times when we don't want to use our ultraportables.</p> <p>A final point before we move into the predictions: companies develop a lot less in their second decade than their first. Though it helps to be a multibillion pound company if you do want to have a stab at continuing your dramatic growth.</p> <p>OK, so what should we expect from Google in the next 10 years?</p> <p>First, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/android/\">Android, its mobile phone platform</a>, is very important. Google wants to be in your mobile phone where you're making searches and calls. It wants to know what you're doing there so it can persuade companies to advertise with it. After all, if you're a company and all the mobile phone traffic you see comes via an Android phone, you're going to listen with more interest to Google's ad sales people than Microsoft's. </p> <p>Here's my forecast: in 10 years, Android phones will be outselling phones using Microsoft Windows Mobile or Apple iPhones. Yes, I do think that.</p> <p>Secondly, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">Chrome - its browser</a> - is going to be preloaded, and often the default, in computers that you buy in shops, whether full-sized ones or the ultraportables. Google has the financial muscle to make that happen, which Firefox (owned by the Mozilla Foundation) doesn't.</p> <p>In fact the ultraportables are important to this story. They are the real incarnation of what Bill Gates thought the Tablet would be. His 2001 forecast that in five years the Tablet would be the dominant model on sale was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/charles-arthur-on-technology-581023.html\">wrong</a>. But I'll pick up his wonky prediction cap. I think that it will be true of the ultraportable in five years or so; in 10 years, surely.</p> <p>And I think that ultraportable, like the Android phones, will be running Linux, because there's a lot of effort gone into developing low-power versions of it already. And they'll have Google as a default search engine, and run Chrome, which will be used to write documents and do spreadsheets and check email and work collaboratively \u2013 with the data stored both in the \"cloud\" (on Google's or other servers) and also saved locally, on the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html\">SQLite database that underlies Google Gears</a>. (Data in two places. It's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/14/email.yahoo\">safe</a>.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google's other initiative is going to be in energy. It uses colossal amounts of energy for its server farms. It's going to be walloped by rising energy costs, which is a key reason why last November it began its \"RE&lt;C\" program \u2013 with the aim of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20071127_green.html\">making renewable energy cheaper than coal</a>. At the time Larry Page said: \"With talented technologists, great partners and significant investments, we hope to rapidly push forward. Our goal is to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal. We are optimistic this can be done in years, not decades.\" (One gigawatt can power a city the size of San Francisco. Or a few Google server farms.)</p> <p>And, quite possibly, Google will sell some of that energy to the electric grid. How would you like to have your Google-laden ultraportable powered by green Google electric juice? Now there's a capture of the market for you.</p> <p>Into this scenario I can see a couple of clouds that will loom. Larry Page and Sergey Brin have had their differences; I suspect that Battelle is right that one of them will leave within the next decade, and how Google reacts to that will be key to its future.</p> <p>The other two things that will be a problem are that China will resist Google, because its authoritarian government cannot contemplate the openness of information the search engine represents. China, already the largest internet nation, will be stubbornly closed to Google's best endeavours.</p> <p>The other is that there is going to be one hell of an antitrust case coming. Google's in so many places at so many times, and so dominant particularly in search, that it cannot avoid this: it'll move into some new market, and someone will raise a huge stink about how it is using its power in search to take over a new market. (A reminder: having a monopoly isn't illegal. Using that monopoly to force others out of other markets is.)</p> <p>As Microsoft discovered, fighting an antitrust case takes the creative wind out of your sails; it becomes all you can do to row to shore. The Microsoft of 10 years ago was cocky, confident; today it's vast, but uncertain, overwhelmed by its bureaucracy. That could be Google's fate \u2013 even as in 10 years we use its tools all the time, and a significant number of people use phones and computers based around its products, it will be becoming sclerotic.</p> <p>And then it will be time for something completely new to burst onto the scene. Very probably the people who are going to do that have only just started their first day at secondary school (high school to our American readers). </p> <p>You can't guess what it will be. But if some kids ask to use your garage for a computer project, my advice would be to let them \u2013 and ask if they'll let you fund them in exchange for a few shares. Ask for 10%. If it pays off, by 2030 you'll never need to work again.</p>",
  "<p>Time for a giggle. Time, too, for a little serious thinking about data protection.</p> <p>The giggle turns up in a story today about a faulty birthday present. A seven-year old boy opens a package from his aunt to find within \u2013 oh, ecstasy! \u2013 a superman outfit. Then, catastrophe: the belt is missing. How can he be Superman without a superbelt to hold his superpants up?</p> <p>So his mother phones Marks &amp; Spencer, and here <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1052368/M-S-refuses-speak-mum-7-year-old-sons-faulty-Superman-suit-breach-data-protection-rights.html\">the farce begins</a>. The helpline operator cannot speak to the boy's mum until the boy has answered some questions to identify himself. Not only that, he must also give consent for his mother to speak to M&amp;S on his behalf.</p> <p>A harried few minutes follow. Eventually all is sorted and, on being made aware of their boo-boo \u2013 which M&amp;S put down to \"human error\" \u2013 the boy scores a Hulk outfit, by way of compensation.</p> <p>But now for the seriousness. It is pleasantly ironic that the episode of the Superman outfit should take place in the very week chosen by the information commissioner to remind organisations not <a href=\"http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/pressreleases/2008/data_protection_duck_out_010908.pdf\">to hide behind (pdf)</a> the Data Protection Act. </p> <p>Over at the office of the information commissioner, they have a fair few cases where myth appears to have overtaken reality: priests informed they must not pray for the sick by name; a wife told she could not request an insurance claim form for her husband; parents blocked from learning their children's exam results. In every case, it turns out, because someone, somewhere wrongly believed the DPA made this so. </p> <p>There is none so fanatic as the recent convert, and part of the problem lies in the gradual shift over the last few years (but accelerated, with every news story about our personal data going walkabout) from blase indifference, to intense back-covering. The financial penalties are mostly not too great, but organisations are beginning to wake up to the fact that the public don't like data mismanagement, and are reacting accordingly.</p> <p>The worst offenders of all are local government, whose volte-face in this period means they are now about as paranoid as a paranoid thing can be.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the last misconception \u2013 about children's data rights \u2013 springs from a much wider, more serious misapprehension on the part of officialdom. Following the <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillick_competence\">Gillick ruling</a>, which allows \"children\" to pick up aspects of parental responsibility as and when they are competent to do so, local authorities have tended to apply this across the board to young person's data. </p> <p>My own first intimation of this was when my local library informed me that once my daughter reached the age of 12, I would no longer be able to inquire as to what books she had on her card.</p> <p>Excuse me?</p> <p>I argued then that this was wrong in law \u2013 and was much encouraged this week to discover none other than Professor Ross Anderson, Chairman of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, saying <a href=\" http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/kids.pdf\">much the same (pdf)</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, this view seems to permeate government at all levels, and it has serious consequences. It means that government believes that when it comes to children's data \u2013 systems such as the now-controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/02/schools.children1\">ContactPoint database</a>, for instance \u2013 they can finesse parental concerns about data protection and effectively remove parents from the loop by relying on the theory that control of personal data resides with the children. It doesn't. But you'll have a hard time convincing officials otherwise.</p> <p>Over at M&amp;S, their helpline operator didn't find the idea of quizzing a seven-year-old over data protection at all incredible. Apparently, he claimed, he'd done the same to a four-year-old some weeks previously. At least the government so far appears to be drawing the line at 12.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> East London.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Mama (lead vocals), Ru Man Chu (bass, vocals), Flip X (guitars, synths), Killer Jules (drums).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> There have been countless bands over the last few years who have paid lip service to the electronic pop sound of the early 80s, but none of them have thus far taken the step of collaborating with the original architect of that sound: Martin Rushent, the renowned producer of the Human League's 1981 world-conquering synth-pop album, Dare. You immediately know that Mama Shamone are going to be worth checking out because they're working with Rushent and most of the people he's produced \u2013 the League, Altered Images, Buzzcocks, Pete Shelley, the Stranglers, Generation X, XTC \u2013 are great, groundbreaking, or at the very least supremely entertaining. <br> The first thing that surprises about Mama Shamone are the guitars. When the League still featured members of Heaven 17, they had a manifesto, \"Destroy Rock'n'Roll\", years before fellow Sheffield electro-terrorists LFO had a similar war cry, that was all about the imminent obsolescence of the electric guitar. Consequently, the League, under Rushent's watchful eye, were all about cold machine beats and synthetic melodies created on keyboards. Mama Shamone aren't quite that hardline, which is a shame. They've got guitars as well as electronic gadgets, lots of them, slashing and scything their way across the synth-o-sphere like graffiti on a pristine futurescape.  And so, with a brash, belligerent she-creature called Mama on vocals \u2013 well, not vocals, more like wails and shrieks \u2013 they're not quite the iced-soul, Aretha-sings-Kraftwerk experiment we were expecting, more like, as one early write-up put it, \"Tina Turner fronting Magazine\", and there are certainly far worse things to be than that. Only occasionally do they raise the ugly spectre of Skunk Anansie, that 90s Brit-grunge band with a scary, screechy (black) female singer called Skin whose entire raison d'etre seemed to be to see how many times she could get journalists to use the phrase \"in-yer-face\" in their reviews. We've been here before several times over the last 12 months with the shouty, colourful frontwoman using noise and electronics to talk fast and loose (in this case, lyrics about love as infection, sex, obsession and coprophilia) \u2013 the Noisettes and Ebony Bones, even thecocknbullkid, have been here or hereabouts, and it remains to be seen whether the public have any appetite whatsoever for this sort of harsh screamtronica or whether it's going to continue to be regarded as mere London style-mag hype-fodder. Still, it's all been plain sailing so far for Mama Shamone: they beat 3,000 hopefuls on Channel 4's Road to V competition to secure a slot at this year's V festival; they were a MySpace band of the week, after which Mark Ronson sent them a message conveying his admiration; they played the BBC Introducing stage at Bestival; and they've been gigging so furiously (including support slots with Bloc Party and the Rakes) they've been described as \"the hardest-working band in Britain\". That's not the only accolade they've received. \"These guys are destined for greatness,\" wrote one breathless hack after one of Mama Shamone's gigs. \"It felt like I was witnessing history being shaped.\" We vaguely recall people getting in a similar tizz about Ebony Bones a few months back and the Noisettes last year, but we'll see.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Blazing punk rock and eerie electro with a carefree attitude.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They tick so many boxes they're in danger of looking like they were focus-grouped into existence. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be on the cover of The Face if the magazine ever comes back.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be on the cover of Shoot if it ever comes back.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut EP Over is available now on Genetic. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Santogold, Shingai Shoniwa, thecocknbullkid, Ebony Bones. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/mamashamone\">www.myspace.com/mamashamone</a></p> <p><strong>Monday's new band:</strong> Kotchy. <br> </p>",
  "<p>1) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JLXq75SArY\">Argentina 0-5 Colombia</a>, Buenos Aires, September 5 1993</strong></p> <p>The age-old, yet increasingly ignored, maxim that a successful team does not necessarily comprise the best players has never been better exemplified than in Colombia's demolition of Argentina, which changed the life of so many and ultimately curtailed the life of Andr\u00e9s Escobar. Faustino Asprilla and Carlos Valderrama were the only true stars of the side, but the key to the overall excellence was their almost telepathic understanding with Freddy Rinc\u00f3n, Adolfo Valencia and the water-carriers, Leonel \u00c1lvarez and Gabriel Gomez. Watching them fizz the sphere around at pace was like seeing Sensible Soccer come to life.</p> <p>Take the first goal: Valderrama's brilliant pass opens up the defence, with the sudden and devastating effect of someone whisking away another man's towel in a locker-room, allowing the marauding Rinc\u00f3n to score. Once Asprilla had teased Diego Simeone to score the second, Colombia were able to sit in and simply shred Argentina with some don't-blink-and-you'll-still-probably-miss-it counter-attacks. Asprilla's preposterously good chip for the fourth goal sticks in the memory, but the other two were also beautiful in their conception.</p> <p>Some will say this particular Argentina team was relatively poor - names like Julio C\u00e9sar Saldana, Miguel Zapata and Ram\u00f3n Medina Bello would not enter pantheon - but defeats like this just do not happen to the big boys on their own patch. It was like seeing Vic Mackey get duffed up on the streets of Farmington. And besides, as Colombia had showed, you didn't need stars to be a great team.</p> <p>2) <strong>Poland 0-0 England, Katowice, October 11 1989</strong></p> <p>Everybody remembers England's Italia 90 campaign - Gazza's tears, Chris Waddle looking about as comfortable as a priest at an orgy while doing that absurd dance with Terry Butcher, the last great England kit, and so on - and how it changed football in this country forever. What few remember, possibly because they didn't know what football was at that point, is how close England came to not even qualifying. Even though they had not conceded a single goal in the campaign, England needed a draw in Poland to clinch a place through a complicated system in which some second-placed sides got through and others didn't. But after 1973, the thought of needing a result against Poland turned the heebie-jeebieometer up to 10, and as an attacking unit England didn't turn up in Katowice.</p> <p>One man turned up, and then set up camp: Peter Shilton. For 90 minutes he was like a man boinging between two adjacent trampolines, leaping left and right to repel some of the most incessant, vicious and accurate long-range shooting ever seen in a single match. Finally, in the very last minute, he was beaten, but Ryszard Tarasiewicz's dipping howitzer thwanged off the crossbar (Shilton, with a straight face, said he pulled his hand away because he didn't want to concede a corner). Had it gone an inch lower, you might not even be reading this.</p> <p>3) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txn6AZnnqhI&amp;feature=related\">Denmark 4-2 USSR</a>, Copenhagen, May 6 1985</strong></p> <p>World Cup qualifiers have so much at stake that, by their very nature, they are invariably more memorable for the tension than the quality of play. This contest, between two sides who would briefly dazzle at Mexico 86, was a significant exception: it was a game of the very highest technical quality. The tempo is frightening even by today's standards, never mind those of 23 years ago.</p> <p>The goals weren't bad either. Preben Elkjaer's second, after he was left alone against four defenders, is a regal combination of skill, strength and swagger; Michael Laudrup's pair could barely have been more contrasting, the languid insouciance of the first followed by a thrillingly direct run from the halfway line for the second; and Oleg Protasov's angry screamer, to bring the USSR back into the game at 2-1, would have been the goal of the game most of the time. It was a sign of things to come: there would be 33 goals in the two sides' eight games at the World Cup a year later.</p> <p>4) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFfQ8ciXrMk&amp;feature=related\">Wales 1-1 Scotland</a>, Cardiff, September 10 1985</strong></p> <p>Scotland's World Cup failures usually have a whiff of the tragicomic, but here their success was entirely overshadowed by tragedy when, towards the end of this pivotal match, their manager Jock Stein suffered a fatal heart attack.</p> <p>The stakes seemed high enough at the start of the game. Wales needed a win to reach a qualification play-off against Australia; Scotland needed a draw. Wales led through a superb goal from Mark Hughes at half-time - when, on an unbelievably manic night, Scotland's Jim Leighton had to be taken off <em>because he'd lost a contact lens and hadn't brought any spares</em> - but a dodgy late penalty, converted nervelessly by Davie Cooper, put Scotland through.</p> <p>Not that it counted for anything half an hour later. Stein's assistant Alex Ferguson had to phone Stein's family with the tragic news, a task so far beyond anything you'd find in the Big Book of Management that it boggles the mind. For all the Scottish fans, triumph had never felt so <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8csbWXt__E\">disastrous</a>.</p> <p>5) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BNkO9l318o\">Germany 1-5 England</a>, Munich, September 1 2001</strong></p> <p>Football was a simple game on September 1 2001: 22 men kicked a ball around, and at the end the Germans suffered an unparalleled humiliation. But while they soon put the result to bed like the professionals they are, England couldn't. Indeed English football's most celebrated result since 1966 might have been the worst thing that could have happened. For a start, it ended up creating unreasonable expectations of Sven-Goran Eriksson, who was abused upon leaving the job despite taking England to three consecutive quarter-finals for the first time, one of them with Danny Mills.</p> <p>It also kick-started a process whereby a nascent golden generation - only David Seaman had more than 40 caps here - became an abhorrent bling generation. And worst of all, it helped create Tool Britannia, a cultural revolution in which hundreds of thousands of people would be unable to comprehend why a team blessed with technically superior players could beat Goldenballs, Stevie G, Lamps, Rio, Mickey Blue Eyes and Frankie Knuckles, or whoever else makes up the team.</p> <p>Still, for 90 minutes it was fun. And the schadenfreude has never tasted so good before.</p> <p>6) <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXMwnoAp4kc&amp;feature=related\">Scotland 1-1 Germany</a>, Glasgow, April 16 1969</strong></p> <p>These days you can qualify for the World Cup by doing little more than spelling your name correctly. But back in the day, especially when it was a 16-team tournament, the qualification process provided a serious examination. For Mexico 1970, only one of a great West German side and a very good Scotland side could qualify. The final group table (West Germany 11 points from six games, Scotland 7) suggests a comfortable campaign for West Germany. Far from it. Had Scotland won their penultimate game, in Germany, they would have gone through, and might ultimately have done so with a draw: they lost 3-2, but only to a goal in the last 10 minutes, having led early on through the marvellous Jimmy Johnstone and then equalised through Alan Gilzean just after the hour.</p> <p>We're including the first game between the sides here, mainly because it's on YouTube and the 3-2 isn't, but it was also a bona fide cracker. Towards the end of a see-saw first half, Gerd M\u00fcller typically Abra Kadabrad a goal from a nothing situation before setting off on his inimitable star-jump/air-punch celebration, a gesture <em>so</em> uncool that - mainly because it was M\u00fcller - it became exquisitely cool. But as the second half went on Scotland pummeled the Germans. They might have had more than one penalty (it's interesting to note a German defender gesturing to signal a dive by Denis Law), but eventually equalised with five minutes to go when Bobby Murdoch drove forward from midfield, played a one-two with Charlie Cooke and scorched one into the top corner. The two sides were to be separated in the end, but Scotland emerged from it all with enormous honour.</p>",

  "<p>Another week, another <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/faithschools\">furore of criticism</a> of faith schools - this time stirred up by the new <a href=\"http://www.accordcoalition.org.uk/\">Accord</a> coalition, co-created by the British Humanist Association, of which Polly Toynbee is chair. Yes, that would be the same Polly Toynbee whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/02/education.labour\">column</a> in Tuesday's Guardian fulsomely praises Accord and indiscriminately attacks faith schools. <br> Instead, she should be celebrating this week, as one of the most radical pieces of Education legislation comes into force: a duty to promote community cohesion imposed on all state-funded schools. Yes, not just faith schools but all schools and I suspect therein lies the rub for Accord. Once all schools, including faith schools, are inspected by <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\">Ofsted</a> on how successfully they promote cohesion, a standard will be set by which we can truly judge what they contribute to wider society instead of relying on the inevitably biased studies which are frequently produced by those on both sides of the argument to prove their points.</p> <p>But members of Accord take no account of the education world as a whole. Yes, of course, there are schools in Britain which are segregated, eg schools which are 98% Bengali Muslim (not faith schools but inner city London schools) and many which are 100% white (again, not faith schools but rural schools all over the country). The main thing which determines diversity or the lack of it in a school's admissions is not faith but location, and the intake of state-funded faith schools often reflects a broader ethnic and socio-economic range than comprehensive schools in the same area.</p> <p>I say \"often\" and not \"always\" because unlike those who criticise faith schools, I don't want to over-generalise. For a group that says it's focused on encouraging diversity, Accord talks about faith schools as homogenous entities. They are not. <br> My organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.boardofdeputies.org.uk/\">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a>, represents state-funded Jewish schools and is rightly proud to do so. Jewish schools provide an environment where our young people, very often already thoroughly integrated British kids, can connect with and learn about their Jewish heritage in ways that would otherwise simply not be available to them. To deny them that would actually represent a triumph of uniformity over diversity whereas, secure in their Jewish roots, they are better equipped to make a profound contribution to civil society. <br> Of course there are some \"bad\" faith schools, just as there are good and bad schools in every part of the education sector. But to cast faith schools as a whole as a wicked or divisive force in society does a huge disservice to the many excellent faith schools which work tirelessly to couple high quality education with religious values of respect and care for others.  Many parents choose faith schools for their children and parental choice is a fundamental tenet of education law. European human rights legislation guarantees the rights of parents to schooling compatible with their religious and philosophical beliefs. I stand as one of the members of the Faith School Providers Group to guarantee that faith schools will continue to work to be a positive educational choice, encouraging social responsibility and fulfilling their duty to promote community cohesion.</p>",
  "<p>Tonight I'm speaking at \"<a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/events.php?ref=sb#/event.php?eid=39065361008\">An evening of Women's Politics</a>\" in Manchester. The event aims to encourage and support more women to get directly involved in politics as candidates, governors or activists.</p> <p>You still get the odd sneers about such events, and there certainly remains a fair amount of resentment towards the positive measures used in the Labour party to ensure more women get selected, for example all-women shortlists. But during a year when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">United States might get its first female vice-president</a>, doesn't this show that the glass ceiling is finally broken and that we should simply leave women's representation to \"market forces\"?</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/04/equality.humanrights\">report out this week in Britain by the Human Rights and Equality Commission</a> shows very clearly that the answer is no. The Sex and Power report finds that in many areas of public and business life the percentage of women in top jobs is actually falling, let alone taking significant strides forward.</p> <p>In politics, the number of women in the cabinet has fallen and, if current poll trends continue and Labour loses a number of marginal seats, the number of female MPs is likely to drop significantly. (The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/03/liberaldemocrats.women\">Lib Dems</a> and Tories select far fewer women as candidates.)</p> <p>Indeed, even the coverage that has met Sarah Palin's nomination this week, which questions whether she can juggle five children with the demands of becoming vice-president, indicates that attitudes to women in top jobs (unless they also sacrifice having a family) have changed little over the past decades.</p> <p>(I must just make clear at this point that, while I welcome Palin challenging this stereotype, I profoundly disagree with her stance on most issues.)</p> <p>The Labour party has done more than any other to address gender inequalities, through legislation and other means, and to increase women's representation in politics, which has led to recent increases in the number of female politicians.</p> <p>However, there are clearly other cultural, attitudinal and institutional forces at play that prevent more women going all the way to the top. </p> <p>Take, for example, politics, as that is what I'll be discussing tonight. As a relatively young woman - I'm 33 - I hope to one day have a family and already have commitments. If and when I'm elected as an MP, I would face a choice: take my family with me to London each week or be apart for four, maybe five, nights a week. It's something I've thought about, but for many women it's a choice they don't want to make and it puts them off standing. (For fathers, often the choice isn't as guilt-ridden and emotionally difficult.) It's a dilemma Palin too will face if elected: move all her family to Washington or be apart most of the week.</p> <p>Many of the institutional reforms proposed that would lower this barrier for women, such as remote or virtual voting in parliament to reduce the number of nights MPs are required to spend in London, have been rejected by MPs.</p> <p>So until we recognise and value the demands of motherhood alongside work and create the culture and institutional climate that enables it, the glass ceiling for women will remain.</p>",

At a joint press conference at City Hall on Wednesday, Boris Johnson and Sir Paul Stephenson hawked Scotland Yard's new, London-wide <a href=\"http://maps.met.police.uk/\">crime mapping website</a> with the uncrushable optimism and huckster guile of door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesmen. Is law-breaking soiling the deep pile of your neighbourhood? We have the answer! <a href=\"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/paul.linnell/sso/hoover/hoover541ad.jpg\">It beats as it sweeps as it cleans!</a></p> <p>That sounds too cynical, and is. Oh, doubts are justified. Johnson likes crime maps because they were part of Rudi Giuliani's \"<a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12481097/\">miracle</a>\", but the right never addresses why the miracle happened <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4039259.ece\">everywhere else too</a>. The Met's site is, in any case, not the same or as the CompStat system used in New York. Add the usual data debates about changing categorisations, under-reporting (especially in poor areas) and concentrated police action making the stats look worse rather than the problem appear addressed, and you've good reason for wondering if the \u00a3210,000 it cost to set the system up has been well spent. </p> <p>Against all that, though \u2013 and here's where the pitch was smart \u2013 the emphasis was all on enhancing police accountability and public confidence. Never mind, we were told, that including data about clear-up rates is only being \"considered\" or that the stories it tells about each ward \u2013 \"sub-ward\", even \u2013 of the capital might differ sharply from the one told on the ground, the point was that the maps would encourage \"a more detailed conversation\" with people, Stephenson said. Johnson stressed that he wanted Londoners to see and therefore believe that when they become a victim of an offence, it does not go unnoticed.</p> <p>Well, fair enough. These are desirable goals and good luck with pursuing them, gentlemen. I just hope you're never accused of overselling. Crime-busting initiatives, especially when a groovy bit of high-tech kit is involved, raise expectations that seem doomed never to be satisfied. Johnson profited in the mayoral election campaign by siding with public scepticism about every official claim that crime is down. In a climate of horror about teenage knife attacks in particular, Ken Livingstone's cold numbers cut little ice with London's electors compared with Johnson's warm promises to listen to their anxieties and act. But will his actions produce results? </p> <p>It's an indictment of 10 years of Labour in government that a sometime figure of fun like Johnson now intones a version of the crime-and-its-causes mantra more convincingly than the party whose former leader invented it. Has there been a sadder feature of all those years in power than the risible \"tough\" posturing of successive Labour home secretaries or Tony Blair's Dirty Harry strutting at the dispatch box during his final months? As Labour has degenerated into craven tabloid-pleasing, Tories often <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20080120/ai_n21207413\">look enlightened</a> by comparison.</p> <p>Johnson has a chance to translate appearances into reality. It's early days and so no surprise that he's offered mostly gestures so far: the public transport booze ban might not be enforceable; he may be sort of right that every knife seized under <a href=\"http://cms.met.police.uk/news/major_operational_announcements/more_than_500_knives_seized_in_blunt_ii\">Operation Blunt 2</a> represents a potential life saved, but there's always another blade in the kitchen drawer. The true tests are yet to come, and public opinion \u2013 unreasonable, irrational and driven by fright \u2013 will set the hardest of them. </p> <p>I returned from my summer travels to learn that two more teenagers had died within walking distance of my east London home. One fell while trying to climb down the side of the block of flats where he lived, apparently <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7574210.stm\">fearing</a> that a group of youths was coming to kill him. The other, just 14 years old, was stabbed after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/02/knifecrime.ukcrime\">attacked</a> by a gang within yards of his front door. The rate of teen murders in London this year is close to one a week. Sooner or later, citizens will start asking why Johnson hasn't brought it down.</p> <p>The question won't be fair. Unlike other crimes, the incidence of murder is not difficult to measure \u2013 it's hard to miscount corpses \u2013 but its causes and the secrets of its prevention are as complex and varied as with any other kind of offence. No London mayor \u2013 no politician \u2013 can solve all of these and any deep and substantial difference he makes will not be easy to quantify, let alone claim credit for \u2013 especially when he got elected rubbishing Met figures. Moreover, Johnson's powers to tackle the entrenched inequalities that help to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/ukcrime.economicgrowth\">nurture barbarous tendencies</a> are limited. </p> <p>What he has, though, is energy and big promises to keep. His policies for combating youth disaffection \u2013 the \"causes\" side of the Blairite equation \u2013 will be unveiled in the coming months and may surprise us with their scope. It will be ironic and, to a degree, deserved if his exploitation of the crime issue becomes a rod for his own back, and the cynicism I felt at the crime-mapping launch won't go away. But Johnson is making braver and wiser noises about crime than any other politician at this time. For that alone, let's wish him well.</p> <p><strong>Read Dave Hill's brand new London Blog <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog\">here</a>.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Tom Cruise <em>is</em> John McCain. No, he is, and not in a in a Fox-is-rushing-out-a-biopic-before-November kind of a way. It is my conjecture that day in, day out, Tom Cruise is inhabiting the skin of the Republican nominee for president of the United States of America. Like some kind of giant alien lizard.</p> <p>The first time this thought crossed my mind was just two days ago, watching footage of an interview McCain gave to the ABC network's Good Morning America programme. He was defending his choice of Sarah Palin as his vice president. This was only happening because Palin hadn't yet given her world-beating speech and, also, because the US media has an irrevocable liberal bias.</p> <p>McCain's defence was robust, upbeat, wide-eyed and almost unfailingly broad of grin. It reminded me of something. Especially when he delivered the following, climactic line (which you can see at 04.45 on this package from the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7597233.stm\">BBC's Newsnight</a>):</p> <blockquote> <p>Well, I think Americans are going to be very, very, very pleased. I'm very excited about it. I'm very excited. I mean, this person is going to come to Washington and, I'm telling you, to the old boy network, they better look out, because change is coming.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was uttered through a smile that seemed determined to eat the rest of McCain's face. I knew then where I'd seen it before, at the point in that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0\">Scientology video</a> where Cruise says \"I won't hesitate to put ethics on someone else\". Or, maybe, the bit when he laughs for 20 seconds about being asked whether he \"knew an SP\". (I know, it still gets me too). </p> <p>Suddenly, those two performances seemed to share more than just a chintzy backdrop. I started to dig a little deeper, and soon the connections became unignorable. </p> <p>Look at pictures of a <a href=\"http://a.abcnews.com/images/Nightline/ht_jsm_071029_ssv.jpg\">young John McCain</a>. Just look at them. And tell me you disagree with the seven voters on this online poll who <a href=\"http://jyte.com/cl/young-john-mccain-looked-like-tom-cruise\">insist</a> he's the spit of Tom Cruise.</p> <p>Don't stop there though. Dig further. Unearth the astonishing fact that both <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/bio\">Cruise</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0564587/bio\">McCain</a> are 1.70 metres (5ft 7in inches) tall. It's not a fact they want you to know but it's there. Just like the name of the character that made Tom Cruise's reputation. The character whose bravery took him all the way to the Top (Gun): Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell.</p> <p>Oh yes.</p> <p>He's a short-arsed maverick, revered for his record in combat, who has of late developed a maniacal stare. And the same applies to John McCain. Maverick had <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0005704/\">Goose</a> to back him up; today, McCain has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed2/idUSN0333449720080904\">Moose</a>. Just before McCain took the podium in St Paul last night they even played <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0UOZ9NHDsY\">Danger Zone</a> by Kenny Loggins. How much more proof do you want?</p> <p>Goodness knows where it goes from here. Will McCain take up Nascar driving in order to firm up the rust-belt vote? Will he insist that excessively profitable energy companies show him the money? When the phone rings at three in the morning will he descend through the ceiling on a wire to pick it up?</p> <p>The McCain campaign has sought in recent weeks to paint Barack Obama as a \"celebrity\" candidate. At the same time McCain himself pushes his personal narrative to the fore and has chosen a running mate who is already dominating the US tabloids. It's surely only one small step further to believe that McCain is in fact Tom Cruise in prosthetics; the ultimate celebrity candidate.</p>",
  "<p>For Kimi Raikkonen, this weekend might be the most crucial one of his season - if not his career. You have to scroll back nine races for his last victory, in the Spanish grand prix. This weekend in Belgium is where he must prove that he can combat whatever it is that's unravelling his season. He has won the past three formula one races at Spa-Francorchamps. If he cannot make it four, how far will his head drop? Raikkonen has always looked like the man most likely to walk away from the sport if it wasn't fulfilling him. This race could decide more than whether he can fight for the title.</p> <p>Spa is a circuit where the true greats shine - and the Finn has always seemed worthy of lining up alongside the likes of Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. But this year, something has gone wrong. Despite winning the drivers' world championship for Ferrari last year, Raikkonen appears adrift in the team. He cannot get his car to work in qualifying and, quite naturally, the team is talking out loud about him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7776693\">playing second fiddle to Felipe Massa</a> and helping the Brazilian win the title. Column inches are being devoted to the ideal future pairing for Ferrari - Massa and Fernando Alonso seems to be the consensus - and the reigning champion is fading into the background.</p> <p>Raikkonen isn't one to air his private views in public, whereas Alonso's approach has been to shout and scream when he feels a team is not 100% behind him - he did it at Renault and McLaren. Raikkonen's demeanour is one of insouciance. He is indifferent when answering questions in press conferences, the shrug of his shoulders a barrier to the thoughts pinging around inside his head. There aren't too many clues about why this championship campaign isn't working when last year's did. Is it the effectiveness of the senior staff? Is it the continued presence of Massa's ally Schumacher? Is it simply that Raikkonen's desire to win is lessened now he has the trophy on his shelf?</p> <p>Not only is the situation curious, it's also rare. The most recent example of a reigning world champion being overtaken by his team-mate is probably more than 20 years ago - the McLaren pair of Niki Lauda and Alain Prost. Lauda had won the 1984 title, but by a mere half a point from Prost. It was to be Lauda's final year in the sport, and Prost had yet to win a title. As Lauda's points tally began to suffer through technical problems, it was clear Prost would win - he did, by 20 points. In the Dutch race, just a smattering of cars were left in the closing stages and Lauda, being followed by Prost, took the flag for his last grand prix victory. He didn't let his team-mate through - a triple world champion's prerogative, perhaps.</p> <p>If Raikkonen cannot win at Spa - a track which is made for his Ferrari and where he has dominated - then something must be fundamentally wrong. His two victories and two pole positions so far this season compare to four apiece for his rivals Lewis Hamilton and Massa. Raikkonen still has six more opportunities to catch the pair - Hamilton is <a href=\"http://guardian.autosport.com/cp.php?l=0&amp;r=2008&amp;c=30\">13 points ahead in the drivers' standings</a> and Massa seven - but he must start racking up the points in Belgium. In his pre-race press conference, Raikkonen said he hoped not to reach the stage where he must aid his team-mate but, he added, it depends on how the next races go. For the sake of his reputation, and to show commitment to a future in the sport, this is the moment when the fightback must begin.</p> <h2>IndyCar's admirable racer</h2> <br> <p>One driver who has promised to help his team-mate win a championship is IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon, who will see out this year's final race with Target Chip Ganassi before moving to Panther Racing next season. Wheldon's Ganassi team-mate Scott Dixon is a dead-cert for this year's title, but Wheldon says he'll do \"everything in a professional manner to help him\". Given that Wheldon has been ousted from Ganassi to make way for fellow Briton Dario Franchitti's return to single-seaters (after a failed attempt at Nascar) that's quite a grown-up attitude.</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <br> <p>Fabrizio Giovanardi seemed to be in an unusually dark mood at Silverstone, where he failed to secure his second straight British Touring Car Championship crown with a round to go. His questionable moves on Darren Turner and Mat Jackson were uncharacteristic, especially as the wet weather had gifted him a better-than-expected performance. And he need not have worried - with a 44-point lead over Jason Plato, his title is in the bag ahead of the Brands Hatch finale in a fortnight's time.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <br> <p>Spa-Francorchamps plays host to the penultimate round of the GP2 championship and Giorgio Pantano, Bruno Senna and Lucas di Grassi are the three capable of claiming the title. Of these, di Grassi's would be the fairytale story, having missed the first three rounds, but his challenge is as steep as the Eau-Rouge hill he'll be ascending. Ex-formula one racer Pantano has dominated this year's title race and needs to score just six points more than Senna this weekend to secure the crown before the final round at Monza.</p>",

  "<p>Most filmgoers recall Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950) saying: \"We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!\" I was reminded of these lines while watching Abbas Kiarostami's Shirin at the Venice Film Festival a few days ago.</p> <p>While all the films that gathered the most ballyhoo and newspaper space, inevitably American, have already faded from memory including the Coens' puerile Burn After Reading, Guillermo Arriaga's tricksy The Burning Plain, Jonathan Demme's tiresome Rachel Getting Married and Kathryn Bigelow's dubious Hurt Locker, what remains, above all, is the vision of women's faces in large close-ups for 92 minutes in Kiarostami's film, radical in both style and content.</p> <p>It is the apotheosis of female close-ups as part of the syntax of the film's style, which has virtually been neglected since the 1960s. If one thinks back on the great tradition, the first highlight that springs to mind is the agonized face of Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), Carl Dreyer's intense depiction of human suffering, a soul in torment personified by the close-up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337336658\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/05/pan220.jpg\" alt=\"Louise Brooks in Pandora's Box\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louise Brooks in Pandora's Box (1928)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Louise Brooks's black bobbed hair framing her pale kittenish face in GW Pabst's Pandora's Box (1928) and The Diary of a Lost Girl (1929) burns itself into the mind. It was Pabst who gave the 20-year-old Greta Garbo her first real chance to emote as a woman on the brink of prostitution in Joyless Street (1925), the role that led to her Hollywood career, prompting Roland Barthes to write in 1957: \"Garbo still belongs to that moment in cinema when capturing the human face plunged audiences into the deepest ecstasy, when one literally lost oneself in a human image as one would in a philtre, when the face represented a kind of absolute state of the flesh, which could be neither reached nor renounced.\"</p> <p>Marlene Dietrich's career only began to bloom with the coming of sound and her meeting with Josef Von Sternberg, who created her iconographic figure as the eternal femme fatale in various guises, conjured up by makeup, costumes and the subtle play of light and shadow on her face in close-up. Dietrich's face became an erogenous zone in Sternberg's pictures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337336659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/05/star220.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Garland in A Star is Born\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Garland in A Star Is Born</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 30s and 40s, the female face in gorgeous close-up became a staple of the Hollywood studios when the Hayes Code prevented revealing shots of the body, whether Katharine Hepburn in George Cukor's films, Joan Crawford in A Woman's Face (1941) and Mildred Pierce (1945), Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca (1942) (and later, less glamorous but still beautiful, in Roberto Rossellini's films) and Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946). Gloria Swanson told Cecil B DeMille that she was \"ready for her close-up\" at the end of Sunset Boulevard, and Wilder moves in as tight as he can until she dissolves, while Judy Garland mimicked \"a big fat close-up\" in A Star is Born (1954) by framing her face with her two hands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337336660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/05/ten220.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Abbas Kiarostami's Ten\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Abbas Kiarostami's Ten</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the studio system collapsed, there were fewer and fewer stars that could be submitted to such cinematic scrutiny. In France, Jean-Luc Godard used Anna Karina's face in close-up to devastating effect especially in Vivre sa vie (1962) in the scene where she is watching Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc. With Persona (1966), the female face in close up became Ingmar Bergman's field of vision, although women had always been central to his work. Bergman was the last great director to focus on a woman's face until Kiarostami. Ten (2002) consists of ten close-up takes of different women in a car, and in Shirin, a group of women, of different generations are photographed in an audience ostensibly watching a film of a 14th century Persian tale. Unlike other Kiarostami films, these women are all professional actors, including Juliette Binoche, some of them banned from performing under the present regime. We watch their reactions and only hear the soundtrack of the film, using their expressions to help us imagine the story. Here are defiant women from a strict Islamic society revealing their faces, and their emotions, with a few out-of-focus glimpses of men in the background. They didn't have dialogue. They had faces.</p>",

  "<p>Caroline Lucas is expected to be named the Green party's first leader later today following a ballot of members.</p> <p>The election will mark an important development in the history of the party, which has never had a leader in a history going back more than 20 years.</p> <p>Lucas, one of the party's two MEPs and one of its two principal speakers, is one of two candidates for the leadership post. She is strongly tipped to win because she is far better known in the party than her opponent, Ashley Gunstock.</p> <p>In a campaign message she said: \"The election of a leadership team offers us new and exciting opportunities to take the radical message of Green politics into the mainstream \u2013 where it belongs.</p> <p>\"The need for Green political influence has never been so urgent, and never has there been so much at stake. I would regard it as a major part of my role to communicate that even more effectively.\"</p> <p>Until now the Green party has always had principal speakers \u2013 in effect party spokespeople \u2013 instead of a leader. This reflected a suspicion of hierarchies that members shared when the party originated in the 1970s, first as an organisation called PEOPLE, which turned into the Ecology party before becoming the Green party in 1985.</p> <p>The party has often been criticised for not having a normal leader and last year members voted by 74% in favour of changing its constitution to create a leader post.</p> <p>The party has around 7,000 members. Voting closes at 6pm and the winner will be announced at 8pm.</p> <p>If elected, Lucas will only be allowed to serve a maximum of 10 years under party rules. If the leader is a woman, the rules say that the deputy leader's post must go to a man (and vice versa).</p> <p>The Greens have 125 councillors in the UK, two seats on the London assembly and two seats in the Scottish parliament. </p> <p>In her campaign statement Lucas said: \"I want the party to start routinely winning deposits back, and to start taking control of its first councils. </p> <p>\"At the European elections next year, I don't just want us to hold on to our two existing seats, but to win two more, in the Eastern region and North West. And at the next general election, I would love the party to be in a position to offer everyone in the country the opportunity to vote Green.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Madrid-based Quarteto Casals have been together for a decade now, quietly establishing an international reputation as one of the most thoughtful of Europe's younger string quartets. These accounts of Brahms's three quartets certainly demonstrate how much care has been put into what they play; these are beautifully prepared performances, with nothing overlooked or out of place. Sometimes, though, a few loose ends or rough edges might be welcome, to lend a greater sense of spontaneity to what can seem to lack instinctive drama; this is very much Brahms as the master craftsman rather than the composer whose iron-clad formal planning just kept his emotions in check. It's typical of the Casals approach that, even in the Piano Quintet, it should be the introspective moments that make the biggest impression - their playing before the finale builds to its last hurrah is beautiful - and in all these works, something a little more three-dimensional is needed.</p>",
  "<p>Detroit's Democratic mayor will be jailed for four months after pleading guilty to obstruction of justice in a plea-bargain arrangement, bringing to an end to a long-running scandal that has cast a shadow over the city.</p> <p>Along with the jail term, Kwame Kilpatrick has been ordered to pay $1m (\u00a3570,000) in restitution to the city, surrender his law licence and serve a five-year probation during which he will be barred from running for office. </p> <p>The scandal stems from the revelation that Kilpatrick had an extramarital affair with his chief of staff, Christine Beatty, and then tried to keep the affair secret. He was accused of forcing three police officers out of their jobs, and then, when they sued the city, of using $8.4m in public money to settle the lawsuit before the affair could be revealed in court. He faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and misconduct charges.</p> <p>In the climax to a long-running scandal, Kilpatrick admitted he lied under oath during a whistleblower trial, which was brought by two sacked police officers.</p> <p>He told the court he had lied in denying he had had an extramarital affair with Beatty. \"I did so with the intent to mislead the court and jury, to impede and obstruct the disposition of justice,\" he said.</p> <p>In a separate deal, he also pleaded no contest to assault. He was charged after pushing and verbally abusing a police officer who was trying to serve a subpoena over the perjury.</p> <p>Kilpatrick, 38, known as the \"hip-hop'' mayor from when he took office in 2002, had been widely seen as a rising member of the Democratic party.</p> <p>But the eight-month scandal threatened to cast a shadow over the US presidential election to the point where the Barack Obama campaign team had called for his resignation, saying that the charges were a distraction the city could not afford.</p> <p>An article in the Detroit Free Press had revealed the mayor had lied on oath. It published <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080429/NEWS01/80429056/-1/NEWS0101\">incriminating text messages</a> between Kilpatrick and Beatty, which led to charges of perjury in January.<br> Kilpatrick was defiant, claiming that the charges against him were racially motivated and that he was being victimised by a \"lynch mob mentality\". The scandal has raised questions over racial tension between white and black people in the city at a time of economic downturn.</p> <p>But he came under intense pressure from his party to step down. The Michigan Democrats warned of the potential damage of the charges on their US presidential campaign.</p> <p>In a speech last night, Kilpatrick said the decision to step down as mayor was the most difficult of his life. </p> <p>\"I take full responsibility for my actions, for the poor judgment that they reflected,\" he said. \"I wish with all my heart that we could turn back the hands of time and tell that young man to make better choices, but I can't.\"</p> <p>Kwame Kenyatta, a city council member, told the Detroit Press <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080904/NEWS01/80904082/1003/NEWS\">the plea was \"sad, but historic\"</a>.</p> <p>\"This will go down in our history as a mayor who fell from grace and had to resign and admit in open court and in front of the world that he obstructed justice and that he lied to the citizens of Detroit,\" Kenyatta said. But, he added, \"this is Motown. This is a city that has come back many, many times before.\"</p> <p>Brooks Patterson, the chief executive of suburban Oakland county and an early critic of Kilpatrick, said: \"Detroit's long political nightmare is finally drawing to a close.''</p>",

In a nod to the credit crunch, this year the unofficial theme is local, affordable organics. There will be a local market in Anchor Square, a gardening zone to inspire cooks to 'grow their own', dedicated areas for debate, and demonstrations focused on cooking real food on a budget.

Kids will love tasting and judging sausages on the sausage trail, trying their hands at circus tricks in the Big Top, and cheering on participants in the waiters' race.

  "<p>That was the 72 hours that was. Alan Curbishley walks the plank in a huff, Kevin Keegan throws his toys out of the pram - at Dennis Wise's head - and Dimitar Berbatov's on, off, on, off, on, off, on move to Manchester United finally materialises. Oh, and there's the small issue of Manchester City's new trillionaire owners from Abu Dhabi and the end of football as we know it. Suddenly the world has woken up to a new era of Monopoly football, an era where the phenomenal wealth and influence of the emerging Middle East will be felt with a force that makes the average Russian oligarch look like a market trader. But with the Premier League on an international break, and the press hungry for more, could this be the first time in history that the footballing world actually pays some attention to the start of the final stage of Asian qualifying for the World Cup?</p> <p>Whilst Europe kicks off its campaign this weekend, Saturday sees two groups of five teams embarking on the last stage of a qualifying process that began last summer. The top two from each group go to South Africa automatically, while a third place play-off works out who will play the winner of the Oceania group. Which will probably be New Zealand. Around the Gulf Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran and, of course, the UAE - who will no doubt have both Sheikh Khalifa of Abu Dhabi and Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai in the stands when they welcome mighty North Korea - will all go into the final round believing they have a great chance of reaching the finals. After all, the three teams on the Arabian side of the Gulf have lavished huge amounts of cash on their squads, arranging top class friendlies, training camps in expensive European cities and hiring big name foreign coaches to spearhead their charge. Yet there's one Gulf state, the ugly duckling of the Persian Gulf, that may well pip all of them to the post to become the smallest ever nation to qualify for a World Cup finals: Bahrain.</p> <p>With a population of just over 700,000 Bahrain is far smaller than the current record holder Trinidad and Tobago. And whilst the rest of the Gulf is preoccupied with garish adornments, Bahrain remains the odd man out, doing things very differently to their neighbour, the UAE. For one, it has a majority Shia population, yet is ruled by a Sunni royal family, a state of affairs that has led to riots, deaths and an attempted Shia Islmaist coup in the early 1980s. Since the turn of the century the king, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, has charted a course through choppy political waters, giving more power to Bahrain's simmering Shia majority, loosening the ban on political parties and instigating universal suffrage whilst trying to eschew the grand pissing contests with its neighbours in favour of a healthy and well regulated bank sector. You'll even find a synagogue in Manama, something you'll resolutely fail to find in the absolute monarchies in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh.</p> <p>Bahrain is also the poorest Gulf state. While the Bahraini Khalifas didn't come close to the $200m (\u00a3113m) needed to trouble the 15 richest royals in a recent Forbes poll, Sheikh Khalifa of Abu Dhabi had his wealth conservatively estimated at $23bn (\u00a313bn), and Sheikh Mohammed at $18bn (\u00a310.2bn). Yet Bahrain has in recent years consistently produced national football teams of higher quality than the UAE. As many as 14 Bahraini players were playing professionally abroad before their failed bid to reach the 2006 World Cup, where they came within one goal of beating Trinidad and Tobago in a play-off. The UAE, which kept all of its players close to home, didn't even make it to the final qualifying round. \"The defeat against Trinidad and Tobago was hard as we were so close to qualifying for the World Cup finals for the first time ever,\" Bahraini midfielder Mohamed Salmeen told MSN. \"It will be very hard to forget that moment but we will try our best to erase the bad memories by producing good performances this time around and qualify for South Africa.\"</p> <p>This time, qualification has been put in the hands of a journeyman manager from the Czech Republic. The Reds have flourished under the guidance of Milan Macala, the kind of thick-skinned coach who would survive a nuclear winter. Somehow he has kept his head above water by traipsing from Middle Eastern club team, to national team, to club team again, being sacked by virtually everyone along way. But after dispensing with rivals Oman, Bahrain shocked the region by beating Japan in the previous round, virtually securing their passage to the last ten and sending out a warning that Bahrain had the potential to beat the best in Asia. \"This was my fifth match against Japan, and today we finally beat them!\" Macala said afterwards, referring to the fact that he had previous lost 4-1 to Japan whilst coach of Saudi Arabia, which cost him his job, and a further three times whilst in charge of Oman. \"I can't tell you how glad I am.\"</p> <p>His only worry now seems to be the timing of matches. The opening group games take place during the holy month of Ramadan when his squad of Muslim players will not be allowed to take on any fluids or eat food during daylight hours. This is less of a problem for Bahrain's first two opponents Japan and Qatar - as several of the latter country's players have been naturalised from Uruguay. The Qataris have long been the bane of Fifa's life after repeatedly trying to get around the issue of having crap footballers by stealing the unwanted flotsam from elsewhere. First they tried buying citizenship for three Brazilian players to help them qualify for the 2006 World Cup and, after that failed, started naturalizing a string of South American players who had played for a few years in their lucrative Q League.</p> <p>It is thought that Fifa's decision to tighten up its own naturalisation rules was largely down to Qatar's moss-like ability to find cracks in apparently watertight legislation. In fact, they sailed so close to the edge they narrowly escaped censure for fielding an ineligible player in the previous round, the (former) Brazilian Emerson. His status was at the centre of legal action from the Iraqi national team after he was part of the side that ended their hopes in the competition earlier in the year. It transpired he had a fake birth certificate and therefore wasn't eligible to play for Qatar at all. Whilst Emerson was banned, the protests for Qatar to be thrown out fell on deaf ears (Fifa ruled there was no way the Qatari FA could have known it was fake) and Jorge Fossati's team will be competing with Bahrain and Uzbekistan for that all important third spot. Japan and Australia should take the top two places.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, in the same group as Iran and both North and South Korea, will do what they always do in these positions - qualify with relative ease. The last time the Saudis failed was in 1990, the year that the UAE, the fifth and final team in that group, made their one and only appearance in the finals. Back then one Carlos Alberto Parreira, later to win the World Cup with Brazil, coached the UAE to three successive defeats, but not everyone lost out. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, then president of the UAE and father of the current leader, Sheikh Khalifa, whose fortune is leading to a run on dish dasha head dresses on the blue side of Manchester, promised a Rolls Royce to anyone on the team who merely scored a goal. Two national team players came home to find a new car parked in the driveway. One suspects that, with Bruno Metsu at the helm on a huge contract, expectations will be a tad higher this time around.</p> <p>Sulieman Al Fahim, the figurehead of the Abu Dhabi United Group, has already stated his wider intentions; that the investment in Manchester City will not only raise the profile of Abu Dhabi but also be a shop window for his country's footballers. The aim is to see more UAE players, like Ismail Matar - who won the Golden Ball at the 2003 World Youth Championship - and his strike partner Faisal Khalil trying to break into European teams (read: Man City).</p> <p>The UAE have a tough task ahead of them and the best they can hope for is a third-place play-off with Bahrain, which would be a fascinating prospect. The cash rich, time poor Emiratis may want the world and everything in it tomorrow, but international football is a great leveller, a place where you have to play with the hand god dealt you, unless you're in charge of Qatar, of course. Bahrain's national football team has far outshone the sneaky Qataris and the lavish Emiratis in the past two qualification campaigns. This is one honour the Nahyan billions can't buy.</p> <p><em>When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone (Mainstream), by James Montague, is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>The number of state school pupils offered places at the University of Cambridge this year increased by more than 200, the institution announced today, saying it was a sign that its socially elite image is beginning to fade. </p> <p>To maintain the trend, the university is <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/df2b8a0a-7ad4-11dd-adbe-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">reported</a> to be considering one-year foundation courses for state school applicants who fail to get top marks at A-level.</p> <p>The proportion of state educated students offered places on the university's undergraduate courses went up four percentage points to 59% this year after several years of no change. For Cambridge this marks the highest number of non-private school entrants since 1981. Overall, 93% of school pupils in England are state educated.</p> <p>The university and its colleges spent \u00a33m last year on work to encourage more applications from students from poorer backgrounds \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a315,000 for each of the 200 additional state school pupils. </p> <p>Geoff Parks, director of admissions for the Cambridge colleges, said the figures were particularly encouraging considering they had improved the bursaries offered to the poorest students since their applications were made.</p> <p>\"We believe this is an example of Cambridge efforts over many years to raise the aspirations and attainment of younger children in state schools finally bearing fruit. We will continue to build on the good work done in our summer schools and outreach visits. </p> <p>\"Hopefully these figures will encourage any able student from a state school or college background who's thinking of applying to Cambridge this October to go for it. There's only one certainty in the Cambridge admissions process: We can only consider you if you apply.\"</p> <p>From this year, Cambridge is abolishing a separate application form and application fee amid concerns they were a deterrent for some students.

According to a new <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/newsandcomment/Pages/CommissionsSexandPowerreportrevealsfewerwomeninpositionsofpowerandinfluence.aspx\">report</a> by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), there are fewer women MPs, cabinet members, national newspaper editors, senior police officers and judges, NHS executives, trade union leaders and heads of professional bodies today than in 2007. Forget the glass ceiling \u2013 what we're dealing with is \"reinforced concrete\".</p> <p>The commission has proposed flexible working as a solution, but if they really think this problem is concrete, why not bring in a bulldozer? It's time to make the case for non-transferable paternity leave. This system is already in place in <a href=\"http://www.norway.org.uk/policy/family/benefits/benefits.htm\">Norway</a>, where dads are given six weeks off \u2013 and if they don't use it, they lose it.</p> <p>There are four key reasons why we should establish Norway's progressive policy in the UK. First, it forcibly breaks down the stereotype that women are housewives and men are breadwinners. Anyone who thinks that social stereotypes that pressure individuals into gender roles don't exist is having a laugh. I'm a feminist, but when I pass a dad swinging a kid in the park on a Monday afternoon, even I think \"Isn't that cute?\" rather than \"Isn't that what we should be expecting 50% of the time?\" </p> <p>Men need to see more examples of other men staying at home to look after their kids before they can begin to think of it as an option for themselves. They need to think of paternity leave as something practical and common rather than something possible but eccentric. The best way we can challenge this norm is to enact a policy that gets fathers into the home on mass. Non-transferable paternity leave does just that.</p> <p>The second benefit of use-or-lose paternity leave is that it evens the cost to employers of hiring men and women. Women will no longer have to disproportionately bear the burden of hearing their bosses' mental alarm bells ring, \"Watch out! Maternity-leave-black-hole approaching!\" whenever they walk into the office. Instead, bosses will know that men will be equally likely to disappear. And why shouldn't they? Women should not be the only ones to suffer the cost of bringing up the next round of human beings that will, ultimately, sustain the workforces of these offices.</p> <p>Third, paternity leave gives dads confidence. Many men might quite like to be stay-at-home fathers, but they are just scared about how to do it. Most new fathers I've seen holding a baby keep it at arms length with a look in their eye that says, \"If this explodes, I'll be blamed\". Women are just as worried about being mothers \u2013 we're also scared that our babies will spontaneously combust \u2013 but because society forces us to play the caring role, we get over it. Getting dads to stay at home through law rather than social convention would help men to do the same.</p> <p>Finally, paternity leave is likely to improve children's relationships with their fathers and provide more male role models for our young people. Instead of being secluded in the office, men will be able to put their all into their child's development. Moreover, the male role models they'll be providing will be men who aren't afraid to care. This is a lot better than the pimps in music videos, the bullies in the school playground or the absent workaholic daddies that kids are normally left to learn from. </p> <p>With more fathers at home, more children will grow up thinking that paternity leave is normal, and an option that is available to them. This is important, because our sexist gender roles aren't just sapping women from top jobs \u2013 they are also constraining men's choices and damaging our children.</p>",
  "<p>Katine is full of promise. Most people are poor, but there's an energy and sense of purpose that the ragged clothes and humble homes cannot obscure.</p> <p>But Dominic Ecou and his wife Deborah Aluko seem without hope. Their compound has three large huts, a remnant of an earlier status. But on the beaten earth floor of the compound, hens peck optimistically at the remains of millet pounded for earlier meals that in most homes would be swept away. Bundles of reeds have been flung over holes in the roof in a random manner. For the first time, there are no chairs to bring out for our meeting.</p> <p>In the small patch of shade cast by a straggly tree the emaciated figure of a young man lies \u2013 in a coma, or a deep sleep, it is hard to tell. Samuel Esaku is recovering from one of the total seizures that he has suffered with increasing severity since he had what was probably cerebral malaria when he was two.</p> <p>It was 1987. Yoweri Museveni had just made his triumphal arrival in Kampala, overthrowing Milton Obote. But in the north and east, it was the collapse of the old regime, not the arrival of the new, that made an impact. There was a terrifying lawlessness that destroyed, among many other things, the infrastructure that might have saved Samuel.</p> <p>Instead there were no doctors and no drugs.</p> <p>When at last a period of peace returned in the early 1990s and the local Catholic church built and equipped a dispensary for returning displaced people, they were given some drugs and told there was nothing more to be done for their son.</p> <p>For a time the drugs \u2013 no one seems quite certain what they were \u2013 helped. But soon he was getting weaker, sweating profusely, and falling down.</p> <p>Then the episodes turned into the nightmare of panic attacks so desperate, Dominic recalled, \"that he would run straight into that tree there as if he could not see it\". There was no doctor to turn to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337345532\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/09/05/Katine-sickness-Samuel.jpg\" alt=\"Katine sickness Samuel\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samuel. Photograph: Anne Perkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Perkins/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"People said he was possessed by evil spirits,\" Dominic said. \"We tried three traditional healers. But there was no improvement. Now we know it is epilepsy. But there are no drugs to control it.\"</p> <p>Their hopes rose briefly when a specialist NGO \u2013 they cannot remember, but there is an <strong><a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.org.ug\">Epilepsy Support Organisation</a></strong> that might have been told about Samuel \u2013 offered help.</p> <p>But when the assessor realised he was now having three or four fits every day, the family was told he was too sick for them to help. </p> <p>Samuel was growing into a young man. He was also becoming violent, and his mother could not cope. Rather than working in the fields, Dominic had to stay home to help care for him. </p> <p>\"When the moon is full, he is at his worst,\" Deborah added. \"The rest of the time, he has only one fit in the day. Then he may have four.\" It is plain that all the family's scant resources are devoted to looking after him.</p> <p>But they know very little about the illness, or the possibility of controlling it through drugs \u2013 drugs that may not be available, and would probably be impossibly expensive, and in severe cases can be difficult to prescribe. In popular African myth, epilepsy is triggered by a burn. It is much more likely that Samuel's is a result of malaria, which leaves one in ten children with seizures.</p> <p>As Dominic struggled to get his land back into productivity, the Lords' Resistance Army struck. They occupied his farm and his home. They destroyed or removed everything of value.</p> <p>By the time it was safe to return, Dominic was 45 \u2013 relatively old for a Ugandan \u2013 and the challenge of starting again, for the third time, has so far been beyond him.</p>",
  "<p>Time is running out for the New York Sun, the bastion of conservatism on the Big Apple's media scene which was co-founded by the crooked peer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/conradblack\">Conrad Black</a> in 2002.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/new-york/the-future-of-the-sun/85129/\">a letter</a> to readers published in Thursday's paper, editor Seth Lipsky revealed that the publication will shut at the end of the month unless it can find fresh financial backing.</p> <p>Lipsky said that when it was created, the Sun had two goals - an \"editorial - and idealistic\" goal of providing an alternative to the New York Times' generally left-leaning commentary and a financial goal of making a profit: \"We have always been, and still are, of the view that the paper needs to achieve both goals to be a success.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a16qOOaE1zcI&amp;refer=us\">Sun's senior managers say</a> the paper, which has a circulation of about 70,000, needs \"tens of millions\" of dollars to survive.</p> <p>When it first appeared, the Sun was derided as an \"intellectual vanity publication\" by Ed Kosner, then editor of the New York Daily News. But its quirky worldview and uncompromising leader columns have become a fixture on newsstands. In the last 10 days, the paper has thundered on America's moral standing in the world (high), the Democrats' convention (apparently a \"disaster\") and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">the US economy</a> (doing better than socialist Europe).</p> <p>Its internal culture is nothing if not consistent with its political mantra. A <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5044701/interns-banned-from-long-subway-rides\">hilarious memo</a> leaked to Gawker this week contains guidelines for student interns, instructing them on the required dress code: \"Interns will not be admitted to the newsroom without a suit and tie - matching jacket and slacks, belt, white or blue shirt, necktie properly knotted, shoes polished.\"</p> <p>On Sundays, they're allowed to downgrade to wool (not cotton or khaki) slacks. But woe betide anybody who lives in the suburbs. Subway rides of more than 30 minutes are verboten in the evenings because interns must be available to answer their cellphones.</p> <h2>A nine-zero man</h2> <p>Now this will be a legal showdown to die for. Donald Trump has got the green light from a judge to subpoena the New York Times' publisher, Arthur Sulzberger, over a book which has infuriated the coiffured property magnate by describing him as a millionaire, rather than a billionaire.</p> <p>Trump has been on the warpath since late 2005 over a biography called \"TrumpNation: the art of being Donald\" which was written by an NYT reporter, Timothy O'Brien.</p> <p>The far from flattering volume alleges that Trump's personal fortune amounts to a mere $150m to $250m. When The Donald read this, he was incandescent - he insists that he is a nine-zero man and that underestimates of his wealth hurt his \"brand and reputation\".<br>Trump wants to quiz Sulzberger, who is nicknamed \"pinch\" for his cost-cutting ways, over an email exchange in which the NYT supremo discussed the book with O'Brien.</p> <p>During the exchange, O'Brien wrote: \"Donald is easy to lampoon but harder to portray accurately (and deep down inside he's really sort of likeable - in the way that endearing but out-of-control 8-year-olds are likeable).\"</p> <p>A supreme court in New York this week quashed Sulzberger's objection and allowed Trump's lawyers to take a deposition.<br>\"The New York supreme court ruled that even the publisher of the New York Times is not shielded from the legal process when it comes to his knowledge of Timothy O'Brien's actual malice towards Donald Trump,\" said <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/local/nj/20080830_Court_sides_with_Trump_in_lawsuit.html\">Trump's lawyer, William Tambussi, in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Plenty of angry words have been flying over the disputed book. When it came out, Trump described O'Brien as a \"terrible writer\". The journalist in turn compared Trump to a Barnum-style circus showman. Trump took this surprisingly well, telling the New York Post: \"That's not an insult, that's a compliment.\"</p> <h2>Another billionaire's woes</h2> <p>A (slight) reality check is looming for John Paulson, the hedge fund boss who earned an eye-watering $3.7bn last year by correctly forecasting a collapse in the market for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">sub-prime mortgage securities</a>.</p> <p>Because of America's housing woes, Paulson has had to cut the asking price for his seven-bedroom retreat in The Hamptons from $19.5m to $16.9m. Paulson wants to offload the 6,800 square foot \"cottage style\" mansion because it is too small - he has traded up <a href=\"http://www.cityfile.com/dailyfile/1597\"> to an estate worth $41.3m</a>.</p> <p>Paulson emerged as the George Soros of the credit crunch last year by winning while everybody else was losing. He is not in the good books of organisations which help those facing foreclosure - one leading community advocate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/19/subprimecrisis.useconomy\">Bruce Marks, told me recently</a> that Paulson's profits were \"obscene\" and that he should devote the money to good works, Bill Gates style, to redeem himself. And he's struggling to pull off the same trick again - <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/seven/08062008/business/july_brought_heat_for_hedgie_paulson_123256.htm\">one of his funds was apparently down 3.7% in July</a>.</p> <p>According to estate agent Prudential Douglas Elliman, the up-for-sale Paulson pad has a year-round pool tastefully enclosed with solar glass. I don't think much of his <a href=\"http://www.prudentialelliman.com/Listings.aspx?ListingID=H37917\">bouffant white living room</a> armchairs, though.</p>",
  "<p>My middle-aged, impetuous sister has just returned from an \"idyllic\" holiday in rural France and is now insisting on selling up and moving out there. I'm concerned her moderate savings will soon run out and it'll all end in tears. Should I talk her out of it? If so, how?</p> <p><strong>A helping hand</strong><br>Suggest that instead of selling up and moving lock, stock and barrel, she should rent out her own home in the UK and find a rental property in the part of France she is proposing to move to. If she spends six months there (ideally during the winter) this will give her an opportunity to see if she really likes it, to brush up on her French (if she doesn't already speak it), to check out other areas that she may like to move to, and to meet local people. It will show her what life is really like there when the sun isn't shining and she is having to deal with the dreary day-to-day things. After this extended stay she'll be in a far better position to make an informed decision on whether this is really where she wants to live. One of my sisters, in her sixties, made the move to a small French village. Four years on she is loving her life there. So what sometimes seem like dubious plans can work out very well. If your sister is really set on this, don't try to talk her out of it. Just help her to do it successfully.<br><strong>Pattie Mason, by email</strong></p> <p><strong>Special interest</strong><br>Arrange an interview with a specialist who will advise on the advantages/disadvantages of living in France.

If she still wishes to go ahead, without proper consideration, at least you'll have done your best.<br><strong>Tony Mayston, Buckingham</strong></p> <p><strong>Don't dictate</strong><br>You could remind her that because somewhere is nice on holiday, doesn't mean it'll seem so idyllic when having to find a job out there. As for whether you should talk her out of it, well it's her mistake to make. She'd resent you for taking away her dream if you talk her out of it, it could be better to let her go but of course be there to support her if it does all go wrong.<br><strong>Whatcher, via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2008/aug/29/1\">theguardian.com/money</a></strong></p> <p><strong>Fan the flame</strong><br>The proceeds from her property sale will go further in rural France. Food, fuel, and the costs of daily living are still lower there, and later her pension can be paid straight into her French euro account if desired (or she can maintain an English bank account). You're seeing the future through your own eyes - work until 65, join a knitting circle and spend retirement in the rain on a miserable state pension. There are alternatives, and your sister has the good fortune to have the capacity and courage to give it a go.

Don't drag her down.<br><strong>Tamara Essex, Dorset (and Andalucia)</strong></p> <p><strong>Questions to be answered</strong><br>What about income? Can she work from home using a computer? Has she a profession or skill she can practise in France? Can she use her home for an income by letting rooms or making it available as a holiday cottage? Has she worked out the cost of living in France? Does she understand the legal and fiscal implications of becoming resident in France? Does she speak the language? I lived in rural France for 15 years and felt privileged to experience real community life, to benefit from the superb French health system, not to mention the cheap and efficient transport, vibrant local markets and the glorious climate.

My parents were absolutely livid and hardly spoke to me for the first 4 months. They now know they were wrong ad I was right. The move has been terrific. It may be my problem about 'forgiving and forgetting' but I still feel slightly resentful on occasions that they made my life so difficult at the outset. Of course they meant well, but it came out as vindictiveness on their part because I didn't do what they said.

Then, raise in turn the practical issues she will need to sort out before moving, such as the costs of health insurance, whether she can find suitable work to supplement her savings, how friendly the locals are to incomers, and whether there are other expats to show her the ropes over there.

  "<p>At least one member of the seven-man semi-redundant IRA army council is known to be a keen fisherman. So perhaps it would be no surprise if he was to invite six of his chums for a spot of sea fishing or maybe a bit of freshwater angling somewhere in an idyllic spot in the west of Ireland.</p> <p>The trouble with such a trip was that if some eagle-eyed member of the public happened to snap a picture of this merry band with the camera on their mobile phone it would have the potential to provoke a political crisis in Northern Ireland. Would the sight of seven men in a boat cause unionists in the north to claim that such a gathering constituted a meeting of the army council? In the recent past IRA senior meetings were held under the cloak of innocent activities such as an Irish language conference. </p> <p>This is the corner the current dominant unionist force \u2013 the DUP \u2013 would paint themselves into if they reject this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/04/northernireland.northernireland\">findings of the International Monitoring Commission that the IRA's ruling body has fallen into \"disuse\"</a>. The organisation set up to scrutinise the ceasefires and make sure all the paramilitary movements were not engaged in violence gave perhaps its frankest analysis yet of where the IRA stands today, namely that it is virtually redundant as a fighting force. </p> <p>The one missing element in the commission's 19th report was that the IMC baulked from saying the IRA army council had been disbanded. The authors, who include a number of former anti-terrorist experts from the UK and Ireland, also emphasised that the Provisionals would not use the D-word either, in this case not decommissioning but rather disbandment. </p> <p>But does it really matter if the IRA says so or not? Lord Alderdice, the former leader of the centrist Alliance party and a member of the IMC, doesn't think so.</p> <p>In the press conference after the report's launch, Alderdice used the metaphor of sleep to explain why it wasn't important that the IRA officially state its supreme decision-making body had been dissolved. For Alderdice, a long-time critic and opponent of IRA and loyalist violence, it was actions rather than words that were the key. The former speaker of the Northern Ireland assembly compared the demand for an official statement to waking up a sleeping man to ask him if he needed a sleeping tablet. In other words, if the IRA was by its inaction no longer functionable as a paramilitary group, then why rouse it from its slumber to ask for confirmation of that?</p> <p>On the same day the IMC report was delivered the Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, announced that there was \"no rational reason\" why progress towards completing devolution - that is, taking control of policing and justice powers - could be achieved. The word \"rational\" is critical here. Because, ever since the IRA concluded it could not win its \"war\" and sued for peace, unionism has been roughly divided into \"rational\" and \"emotional\" camps.</p> <p>The latter is rooted in the view that terrorism should not be appeased, that those behind some of the most heinous crimes of the Troubles don't deserve to take office, that it is morally outrageous and a betrayal of those who died preserving law and order that the perpetrators be placed in political power.</p> <p>\"Rational\" unionism since the time of David Trimble has argued that the pro-union community has to accept unpalatable compromises - for example the early release of paramilitary prisoners, including mass murderers - in order to secure the principle that Northern Ireland can't exit the UK without the consent of a majority, a key goal for unionists given that this majority for now won't vote for Irish unity.</p> <p>From 1994 until approximately 2000 \"rational\" unionism came under fire from the DUP, which represented the \"emotional\", morally-outraged wing of the unionist community. Now, after virtually obliterating Trimble and his old party, the UUP, the DUP has switched over and embraced the rational unionist analysis. Hence the incredible phenomenon of the \"Chuckle Brothers\", when Ian Paisley embraced his old foe Martin McGuinness. The DUP swallowed hard back in the autumn of 2006 at St Andrews because although there was little love lost between themselves and Sinn F\u00e9in they realised they could still shape Northern Ireland's destiny and for the foreseeable future hold on to the union. </p> <p>Lord Alderdice and his colleagues have offered the clearest possible snapshot of the state of play within the Provisional IRA, which, it must be said, has never liked the IMC as a concept. They are telling the DUP that the IRA is not only out of business but is not even a potential threat. </p> <p>The former Israeli prime minister Abba Eban once quipped that the Palestinians never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The same could be true of the unionist political leadership if they miss the opportunity the IMC has provided them with.</p> <p><strong>\u0095 Henry McDonald's new book on Irish republicanism, Gunsmoke and Mirrors, will be published by Gill and Macmillan in October</strong></p>",
  "<p>Shares in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/japan\">Sony</a> plunged today after the firm was forced to recall hundreds of thousands of Vaio laptop computers amid reports that some models have caught fire and injured their owners.</p> <p>Shares in the electronics giant fell more than 4% - their lowest level in almost three years - following the sudden recall of 438,000 PCs worldwide.</p> <p>The recall is a major embarrassment for Sony. In 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/nov/24/japan.money\">it was forced to recall 10m lithium ion batteries</a>, at a cost of \u00a551bn (\u00a3272m), amid fears that they could overheat and catch fire.</p> <p>Sony said it would offer free repairs in the 48 countries, including the US and the UK, in which the potentially faulty model is on sale.</p> <p>A Sony source, who did not wish to be named, admitted that the firm had known about the problem since last August and could have acted more quickly.</p> <p>\"We fully recognise that there were problems with the speed of our response, but we are doing our best to address the problem and make sure it doesn't happen again,\" the source told the Guardian.</p> <p>Though Sony insisted that the problem would have a negligible effect on earnings, analysts said it could harm the firm's brand, just as its president, Sir Howard Stringer, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/may/16/sony.games\">attempting to boost its flagging reputation for quality control</a>.</p> <p>\"If these things pile up and reveal that Sony's structurally weak, then its brand value will definitely be hurt,\" Mitushige Akino of Ichiyoshi Investment Management told Reuters.</p> <p>Sony said Vaio laptops produced between May 2007 and July this year could contain faulty wiring near the machine's hinge that, in some cases, has caused them to short circuit and overheat.</p> <p>The revelation is a blow to Sony's laptop business, which executives hope will be worth \u00a51 trillion by the end of the 2011 fiscal year.</p> <p>Sony said it was aware of 203 overheating cases - 83 of them in Japan - going back to August last year. A small number of Vaio owners had been minor burns, reports said.</p> <p>Despite the firm's reassurances Toshihiro Nikai, the economy, trade and industry minister, said Sony had been too slow to act. \"It is not appropriate, given how big the issue is,\" he said.</p> <p>Analysts speculated that the recall could harm Sony's earnings. The firm's shares dropped 4.2% in Tokyo today to end at \u00a53,880. Shares briefly dropped to \u00a53,850, their lowest level since November 2005.</p>",
  "<p>It was the Asian Human Rights Commission website that first alerted me to the fact that five women had been buried alive as part of an honour killing in the tribal area of Baluchistan \u2013 an atrocity beyond imagination. Within days this tragedy had been reported in the Pakistan national press and almost immediately Baluchistan's Senator Yasmeen Shah took the case to the senate.</p> <p>The treatment of these women shocked and angered me \u2013 and countless others throughout Pakistan. On top of that, when I heard that Senator Israrullah Zehri and Senator Jan Mohammad Jamali stood up in the senate and attempted to justify the murders as \"Baluch tradition\" I was in despair. They said that we should not even be discussing Baluch traditions in the senate. Fortunately, they represent a minority mindset. The case has caused a national uproar. </p> <p>When I realised that the senate was unlikely to take the murders seriously I started to organise. (I've long been involved in human rights issues, writing articles and organising public protests.) I sent emails to various NGOs, human rights activists and also to the Women's Action Forum, calling on them to demonstrate in front of the senate in Islamabad. Although on such short notice I had expected around 100 protesters to come, on the day we had more than three times that number. <br> I am now working closely with Yasmeen Shah, whom I met for the first time at our demonstration. At our request she is now trying to get someone who believes in human rights to join the special committee that has been set up to investigate this crime. There needs to be an independent voice or the entire process will be biased toward Baluch politics. </p> <p>These atrocities represent the structural violence against women in Pakistan. They certainly made me realise that enormous steps have to be taken in the judicial and tribal systems, which thrive on gender hierarchies and inequalities. The people who are guardians of these systems take any challenge \u2013 particularly from women \u2013 as a threat. </p> <p>I feel that the desire to control women's lives and their sexuality is far greater in areas where feudal and tribal systems are prevalent. For example, you will not find the same oppression of women in Islamabad, Karachi or Lahore. But where there is a strong tribal or feudal hold you see that women's sexuality is strictly controlled by the family \u2013 and particularly the male members of the family. </p> <p>I believe that it's high time we introduce land reforms to do away with the tribal and chiefdom systems. We also need to do away with parallel judicial systems such as jirga and punchyat. It's the elected representatives of these systems who have huge stakes in maintaining the gender status quo, and there is very little hope for us that they will do anything to protect women. It is not going to be an easy fight.</p> <p>I believe that the men involved in these honour killings should be arrested and put through the due process of law, but this is not happening in Pakistan. Sadly, the people who inflict this violence on women are getting away with it because they are influential and can manipulate the legal system to escape punishment. And they do. </p> <p>But I believe we should not let this case go. We have to make sure that the perpetrators are punished. We should also ask for long-term legal changes to be made so that women in this country can expect some protection from the law. </p> <p>Although I was shocked and very angry to hear about the murder of these five Baluch women, it's not the first time that this sort of thing has happened. There have been other cases, equally barbaric, that didn't receive such attention. A few months ago, for instance, there was an incident in southern Punjab \u2013 a village woman was accused of having an illegitimate relationship and was stoned to death. </p> <p>Gender inequality is endemic throughout Pakistan, but its manifestation differs between urban and rural areas, and also between social classes. </p> <p>At a professional level, I don't face severe discrimination, but as the head of the Department of Gender Studies at Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, I feel that the university administration, which is run mostly by men, has been unsupportive of my department and at one point even tried to kill it off. Various vice-chancellors along the way have said that gender studies is not a discipline but a mere western clich\u00e9 with no relevance to Pakistan. </p> <p>Other bias I have experienced comes as the result of being vocal about gender issues. When members of the militant group Jamai Hafsa took over the children's library at the Red Mosque in Islamabad and demanded the promulgation of Sharia law, I protested against them. I've been very active in the repeal of the Islamic Hudood legislation that requires, for example, a woman who has been raped to procure four male Muslim witnesses to support her case. Without four male Muslim witnesses, she could find herself accused of adultery and stoned to death. </p> <p>There are fatwas issued against me saying that I should be killed as I am not a Muslim woman. I feel a general sense of insecurity because the people I'm up against are very militant. I feel that at any time they can walk into my home and slit my throat. It is the kind of risk that I have to live with. If I let fear in it will incapacitate me. I have to remain brave, because there are so many risks. </p> <p>As an activist and a professional, I keep seeing different manifestations of this terrible gender bias \u2013 of which the latest is the unfathomable brutality of these Baluchistan honour killings.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Farzana Bari was interviewed by Saundra Satterlee.</p>",
  "<p>New strip, September 2008. Click to enlarge.</p> <p><strong>Keith Hackett's official answers:</strong></p> <p><strong>1) </strong>Accept it. You can take a revised team sheet in these circumstances, so allow the player to be replaced, and a new substitute to be named. <br><strong>2) </strong>Some entertaining answers below. The official line would be this: <br>a) First, you should book all three players*: they are committing dissent. <br>b) You should then show the player who dived a second yellow card for unsporting behaviour, followed by a red. He has committed two yellow card offences almost simultaneously. <br>c) Restart play with the goal kick. <br>This incident is pretty extreme, but demonstrates the people skills referees need to manage players. Avoiding confrontation is always the best idea: clearly, withdrawing your hand before contact was made would have saved a lot of trouble. <br>(*In situations like this some referees may choose to try to manage the situation by only booking the worst offender). <br>I should add that sending the diver off is a contentious call, because the way the Laws treat a player who is committing two yellow card offences at the same time isn't clear. The original directive was that in this situation the two offences should be treated as one incident, and punished with one yellow card. But the Q&amp;A section of the 2006-07 Laws (Law 12, questions 8 and 9) revised this, so that the player should be shown two yellows, and be sent off without a warning. I'm seeking clarification from Fifa, not least because the scenario was entirely omitted from the 2007-08 Laws. In my view, you shouldn't send a player off for a second yellow card offence unless you have first cautioned him as to his future conduct: that's the point of the yellow card system. However, until this issue is resolved, then the 2006-07 Fifa directive stands, and you would send the player off. <br><strong>3)</strong> Show him a second yellow card for dissent, followed by a red. Restart play with an indirect free kick. The holding of the ball for more than six seconds is a side issue here: you must punish the dissent. </p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Jia_(1980)\">Yang Jia</a>, aged 28, was sentenced to death on September 1 for murdering six policemen and injuring another four. His case has raised widespread controversy in China, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/2627001/Chinese-cop-killer-becomes-internet-hero.html\">and beyond</a>, not because of the crimes for which he was convicted, but because of the way the authorities handled the case \u2013 and the deep-rooted, long-ignored social problems that had been revealed during the trial.</p> <p>Born in Beijing, Yang Jia had lived with his mother after his parents divorced 14 years ago. He had worked temporarily in a supermarket, but quit a year later. Since then, the entire family income had been the 1,500-yuan (US$214) pension of his mother. During a trip to Shanxi province two years ago, Yang was wrongly arrested, questioned and beaten by local police. Through persistent petitioning, he finally received some compensation from the police. Then, in a trip to Shanghai last year, Yang was questioned by police on suspicion of stealing a bicycle which he had rented. Feeling insulted, Yang stormed into a police station in Shanghai on July 1 and went on the rampage with a knife. </p> <p>These horrific killings shocked the public, but the way Shanghai police handled this case soon also became a cause for concern. Yang was defended by a lawyer who, appointed by the authorities for this case, had previously worked closely with the local police force. Seeing this as a conflict of interest, 16 lawyers in Beijing jointly issued a statement, questioning the validity of this appointment. Yang's mother, who the public believed was the only person capable of helping to find a lawyer for Yang, and who could provide some background information about Yang's motivation, vanished after Yang was charged. It was widely believed that Yang's mother had been secretly detained by Shanghai police. </p> <p>Yang's trial was first scheduled for July 29. When the case became increasingly sensitive, it was postponed to August 26, two days after the end of the Olympic Games. The trial was held in closed session despite public calls for an open trial. </p> <p>According to Chinese law, a convicted murderer like Yang would invariably be sentenced to death. No one, then, doubted the verdict or was surprised by the sentence. But people <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/09/01/china-yang-jia-given-death-penalty-in-problematic-trial/\">were upset</a> by the secretive and opaque handling of the trial process. Some even suggested that to wreak such crazy revenge, there must have something extremely wrong about the way Shanghai police had handled Yang's bicycle theft investigation: one message posted on an internet forum alleged that Yang had been severely beaten by the police during questioning. The person who posted this message was quickly arrested for disseminating false information.</p> <p>For many years, compared with China's unprecedented GDP growth, moves towards democratic accountability and social progress have lagged far behind. Yang's case exposed again the poor transparency and competence of China's judicial system. The one positive development in this sorry story is that legal professionals and the public came together in this case to call for greater openness and fairer procedures.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier today, I was talking to my friend Deeky Gashlycrumb about the Republican convention. \"I hope they play more <a href=\"http://www.kennyloggins.com/\">Kenny Loggins</a> tonight,\" I told him. \"I would really appreciate an unintentionally homoerotic interlude of Loggins' Playing with the Boys, from the fantastic Top Gun soundtrack,\" he replied. \"I long for some <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0UOZ9NHDsY\">Danger Zone</a> myself,\" I said.</p> <p>Tonight, I tuned in just in time to see Republicans dancing to Danger Zone on the floor of the convention hall.</p> <p>They're really making this too easy.</p> <p>It's Day Four of the Not-Barack Obama Convention, and tonight is John McCain's turn to tell America that he was a POW. For the occasion, they have specially built a mavericky delicious \"catwalk\" stage, ostensibly to create a more \"townhall\" experience, but realistically, since McCain is intensely dependent on teleprompters, it's to fill more space on the still-not-full convention floor.</p> <p>Tonight is Hawk Night (official theme: \"Peace: A Safer and Secure America\" \u2013 which would make Orwell proud, given that all they're talking about is war). The back of the McCain-Palin signs, which are handed out each day with theme-evoker on the back, tonight read, simply: PEACE. I'm dubious, but I'll give it a chance (ho ho).</p> <p>Lindsey Graham yells at me. Tom Ridge (who will later in the evening defend \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6ZnHTWWErM\">John Bush</a>\" as his own man) whines at me. Aren't there any new faces up in this joint besides the damn veep nominee?</p> <p>Cindy McCain is introduced with a video of her background and charity work, much of which is for charities I also support. There was a time, not so long ago, when wealthy conservative heiresses and hairy-legged feminazis worked side-by-side for operations like CARE all the time. Cindy McCain seems to represent the best of that tradition to me; her charitable work is very much old-school conservative and old-fashioned <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2006/09/noblesse-oblige.html\">noblesse oblige</a>. I almost sort of dig her \u2013 until I remember how she sat there grinning and nodding sagely as Giuliani and Palin sneered \"community organiser\" <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=community_organizers\">like it was a curse word</a> last night, which is pretty shady for someone who, presumably, wants people to get involved with charitable pursuits in their own communities.</p> <p>She introduces their seven kids, including their adopted Bangladeshi daughter, Bridget, who was at the centre of a despicable Karl Rove-orchestrated <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Push_poll\">push polling operation</a> back in 2000 about McCain's \"illegitimate black child.\" More evidence that the GOP nominee is a maverick, because it's not just anyone who'd <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/8911.html\">work with</a> a guy who trashed his own kid like that.</p> <p>Cindy McCain's speech is exactly what one would expect. She \"think[s] John was a hero in Vietnam.\" Controversial!</p> <p>As the lights dim for McCain's intro video, the edges of the catwalk glow red and blue. Cute.</p> <p>Things in the John McCain bio package: He was a prisoner of war. He is a maverick.</p> <p>Things not in the John McCain bio package: He dumped his first wife because she'd been disfigured in a car accident. He voted with Bush 90% of the time.</p> <p>Here comes da speech!</p> <p>Almost immediately, a protestor unfurls a \"McCain Votes Against Vets\" sign. He shouts. The audience chants \"USA!\" to drown him out.</p> <p>McCain tells us that, even though they disagree, he respects Obama, because they \"are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other.\" Given that I'm married to an immigrant who is not a citizen (but who signed a paper agreeing to be first drafted to fight for this country for the privilege of living here), making half my family non-Americans, I'm rather unimpressed with that. Sometimes there are things more important than which country issues your goddamned passport, buddy. In a nation of immigrants, I can't be the only person annoyed by that line.</p> <p>A Code Pink protester begins to yell and is shouted down by chants of \"USA!\", then escorted out. So much for that meaningful association with Americans he disagrees with.</p> <p>McCain then assures us he knows who he works for: \"What [being called a maverick] really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.\" Unfortunately, even if McCain has forgotten for whom he really works, <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2007/12/mccain-still-k-street.html \">I haven't</a>. And unless you're working on K Street, he ain't working for you.</p> <p>The speech meanders on. My friends, activist judges. My friends, culture of Life. My friends, tax cuts. He's giving a 30-year-old speech and claiming to be an agent of change.</p> <p>At the end of speech, the big crescendo is McCain urging his peeps to fight: \"I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President .\u2026 Fight with me. Fight with me. Fight for what's right for our country. Fight for the ideals and character of a free people. Fight for our children's future. Fight for justice and opportunity for all.\" It's a weird moment. He sounds desperate and sort of frantic. The crowd rises to the occasion, I guess, but I'm struck by the incongruence of their waving signs with the evening's theme: PEACE. Peace, peace, peace say the signs. Fight, fight, fight urges McCain. More incoherent messaging.</p> <p>And finally it's over. Release the balloons! I never cease to be amused watching adult human beings go hogwild with excitement over balloons falling from a ceiling like it's manna from bloody heaven. Digital fireworks explode on the giant hi-def screen behind McCain and Co., invoking by way of disappointing comparison the real fireworks we saw going off in the stadium Obama filled last week.</p> <p>MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell, swallowed by balloons, approaches <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/washington/15gerson.html\">former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson</a> (with whom I have never agreed about anything before tonight) about McCain's speech. Gerson says, in so many words, that it stunk. He correctly notes that it rehashed typical and well-worn Republican doctrine, failing to communicate that McCain is an atypical Republican, and didn't do much policy-wise to reach out to moderates and independents. The speech was \"not innovative, interesting, or promising.\" Ouch.</p> <p>Graciously, Gerson offers that the (loooooong and detailed) section where McCain spoke about his injuries and brokenness was very powerful and effective. Because McCain's POW story has been relentlessly exploited by every. single. speaker this week, ruthlessly bled dry of every last ounce of its capacity to provoke by sheer overuse, I found it neither powerful nor effective, but tedious and vaguely uncomfortable. Despite my profound political disagreements with McCain, I have heard him speak about his POW experience in the past and been deeply moved. Tonight, after the weeklong opportunistic wringing of his worst personal circumstance for political gain, McCain struck me not as a hero, but as a sad sack telling a sob story in a desperate ploy for pity.</p> <p>In the aftermath, a friend emailed me to say McCain's speech came across \"like he was a regional manager retiring after 40 years service.\" It's an apt description. Let's give him a gold watch and send him on his way.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337321609\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Thank you all very much. Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans - the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for president of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence. </p> <p>In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honour I won't forget. </p> <p>I'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the first lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country. </p> <p>As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of landmines, children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great first lady. </p> <p>When I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character. </p> <p>My heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it. </p> <p>Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honour Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. </p> <p>But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace. </p> <p>These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future. </p> <p>And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and healthcare and the cost of gasoline and groceries. </p> <p>She knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next vice-president to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming. </p> <p>I'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you. </p> <p>You know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you. </p> <p>I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses. </p> <p>I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war. </p> <p>Thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petraeus, and the brave men and women he has the honour to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralised our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans. </p> <p>I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test. </p> <p>I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real-estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills. </p> <p>I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her master's degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me. </p> <p>I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies. </p> <p>I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles. </p> <p>We're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics. </p> <p>We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans. </p> <p>We believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor. </p> <p>We believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities. </p> <p>We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself. </p> <p>I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it. </p> <p>My tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My healthcare plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good healthcare insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages and force families into a government-run healthcare system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor. </p> <p>Keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second-highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity. </p> <p>I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away. </p> <p>We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage. </p> <p>Education is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers and help bad teachers find another line of work. </p> <p>When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity. </p> <p>Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm president, they will. </p> <p>My fellow Americans, when I'm president, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700bn a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles. </p> <p>Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead. </p> <p>This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce. </p> <p>Today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve. </p> <p>We have dealt a serious blow to al-Qaida in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbours, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As president, I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people. </p> <p>We face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace. </p> <p>When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination. </p> <p>I'm running for president to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace. </p> <p>In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it. </p> <p>We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington. </p> <p>The constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you. </p> <p>Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as president. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not. </p> <p>Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability. </p> <p>We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit. </p> <p>I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege. </p> <p>Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love. </p> <p>On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me. </p> <p>Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life. </p> <p>I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralise my fellow prisoners. Our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down. </p> <p>A lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me. </p> <p>When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honour to serve with. Because every day they fought for me. </p> <p>I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's. </p> <p>I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God. </p> <p>If you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our armed forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself. </p> <p>I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me. </p> <p>Fight for what's right for our country. </p> <p>Fight for the ideals and character of a free people. </p> <p>Fight for our children's future. </p> <p>Fight for justice and opportunity for all. </p> <p>Stand up to defend our country from its enemies. </p> <p>Stand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America. </p> <p>Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history. </p> <p>Thank you, and God bless you.</p>",
  "<p>A peaceful but tense anti-war rally today turned into a series of stands-off with police, as youthful demonstrators became angry at being prevented by the riot-gear clad officers from marching toward downtown St Paul and the Republican convention hall.</p> <p>On the fourth day of anti-war demonstrations, protesters assembled in the afternoon on the grounds of the state capital building. After an hour-long rally, the march permit expired and police ordered the crowd to disperse. Groups then marched toward a cathedral near the convention site, but were stopped by police lines at several bridges leading over an interstate highway.</p> <p>Blocked by officers wearing body armour and brandishing long wooden sticks, the protesters stood off against the officers.</p> <p>The demonstrators chanted anti-war anthems and directed their ire at the officers they said had deprived them of their rights to peaceful protest.<br>\"When my city becomes a police state I have to say something,\" said Jim Sazevich, a St Paul historian. \"We're being treated like criminals while the criminals are corralled in the Xcel centre,\" he said, referring to the hall where the Republican convention is taking place.</p> <p>Police made sporadic arrests of demonstrators who crossed their lines, but both sides held back from direct violent confrontation.</p> <p>More than 150 police departments from several states are providing security for the Republican convention. The St Paul and Minneapolis departments, which led law enforcement efforts at the protests, have arrested 430 people in the last several days. </p> <p>Last night, a number of people pouring out of a Rage Against the Machine concert clashed with police, who arrested more than 100.</p> <p>Today, the roving, morphing mass of protesters, who numbered fewer than 1,000, shut down the streets in a swath of St Paul across an interstate highway from the Xcel centre as police sought to contain them. Bridges over the highway were blocked to foot traffic.</p> <p>At one intersection, protesters and demonstrators stared each other down for more than an hour before the demonstrators moved to another intersection to join a separate action. </p> <p>\"I think it's our right to be here,\" said Tim, a protester who declined to give his last name. \"We're trying to be peaceful. We should be allowed to go where we want\".</p>",

(Scroll down for photograph.) Shortly, we'll hear what's surely the most important speech of John McCain's life \u2014 the one for which his whole political career has been a preparation. Liveblogging starts now.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm (all times local)</strong>: Cindy McCain is wowing the crowd with a speech about McCain as loving father, war hero, fantastic husband and war hero. \"We love Cindy!\" read the banners held aloft by the crowd. Now she's singing the praises of \"hockey mom, basketball shootin', moose-huntin', fly-fishin', pistol-packing mother of five for vice president.\" Her delivery's fairly wooden, but it's doing the trick. Cindy McCain is an exceedingly savvy businesswoman who keeps John McCain in ready money, and her global charity work is hugely impressive. But she's not a public speaker. Then again, neither is John McCain, usually.</p> <p>\"I think John was a hero in Vietnam!\" Shall we play wartime-references bingo? First one to spot 40 of them tonight wins a prize. Cindy's got to keep going, because the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/03/AR2008090303255.html?hpid=topnews\">football hasn't finished yet</a>. </p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong>: I was racing from location to location when the video tribute to Cindy McCain was showing, so I didn't feel justified in being snarky about it. So I shall simply <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213685.php\">quote Josh Marshall</a>: \"EDITING GOOF: They left out the part about how John was married when they started dating.\" </p> <p><strong>8.54pm</strong>: Here's a good piece about what John McCain needs to say in his speech tonight, and about how he's <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/09/mccains_speech_what_does_he_ne.html\">got to reach beyond the convention hall to the country</a>. Chris Cilizza is presumably right that McCain is going to talk in much more detail about the incredible hardships he suffered as a prisoner of war, which is probably going to make me feel guilty for joking about how often he mentions it. The other key points: he needs to focus on the economy, and banish the perception he's out of touch with ordinary, financially stretched Americans. And a crucial question: how far he'll distance himself from George Bush, and how the crowd in the hall will respond, because it'll indicate how far Bush-loving conservatives have truly jumped on board the McCain bandwagon.</p> <p><strong>8.59pm</strong>: Warning: Republicans dancing! Or shuffling to left and then to the right, in an embarrassing, socially conservative way. It's not pleasant, even though Johnny B Goode is a very good tune. </p> <p><strong>9.03pm</strong>: OK please stop now.</p> <p>Time for a photograph of the crazy new podium, which I took a few minutes ago during the video tribute to Cindy McCain: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337320632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/5/1220580519340/hall.jpg\" alt=\"Convention hall\" width=\"459\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: John McCain video tribute time! He was a POW. No, <em>for real</em>. This is beyond parody, I'm afraid, so don't expect any parody from me. Now a man with a syrupy voice, like the guy on the cinema trailers, is essentially saying that America would have to be discontinued entirely if it weren't fortunate to have McCain running for president in these terrible times. (Oh! I'm told it's Fred Thompson.)</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: And here he is, in a scary halo of light, as if he were a Celebrity, or the Messiah. Much crowd applause, but it's not on the Palin level.</p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong>: He's got a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/03/the-lime-green-monster-mc_n_105044.html\">green screen behind him again</a>! That's a disastrous choice. He accepts the nomination and careens straight in to some Bush love. \"I'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable.\" He thanks his wife, his mother, Americans, everyone. </p> <p>\"Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration.\" Not Sarah Palin's, though. She thinks you are ridiculous, Obama, and she will mock you for having been a community organiser, and throw moose-antlers in your way to trip you up.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement. But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election.\" Oh, all right, that's the bipartisanship over with. </p> <p><strong>9.26pm</strong>: A serious commotion, as two Code Pink-looking protestors reveal themselves, flash peace signs, and get dragged out by security, thereby amping the crowd up by about 100%. They're almost as loud as they were for Palin yesterday now. Well done Code Pink! Or Republican operatives in disguise, if that's what you really are.</p> <p>McCain chuckles in his trademark sinister fashion and picks up the thread again, which is about how he understands that times are tough. He promises to \"stand on your side\", which sounds painful.</p> <p><strong>9.28pm</strong>: Praising Palin. \"She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and nose...\" He ACTUALLY PAUSES HERE. Her nose? Oh, I see: \"...Worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.\" I seriously thought he was going to give us an Eskimo joke then.</p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: He's happy to have introduced Palin to the country, but he can't wait to introduce her to Washington. She and he are maverick reformer mavericks, who will completely maverick the place up when they get there, \"there\" being, of course, the place McCain has been for many years.</p> <p><strong>9.34pm</strong>: Now he's taking credit for the surge in Iraq. \"I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life.\"</p> <p>\"I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market, so I let them live in one of my spare houses.\" Actually I made that last part up. He works for other ordinary Americans too, including a soldier who died in Iraq, whose bracelet he wears every day. </p> <p><strong>9.37pm</strong>: \"I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption...\" He's talking about how \"both parties\" made government bigger and gave in to oil dependency \u2014 the crowd is silent. Silent. They're uneasy about this, I think. Bit too maverick. Then he vows to \"change that,\" and they're back cheering again. </p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong>: Things \"we\" believe in: low taxes, open markets, \"a culture of life\", faith, work, service, and THE RULE OF LAW. And now it's call-and-response time: \"I will keep taxes low, my opponent will raise them.\" (\"Boo!\") \"I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.\" Obama's healthcare plan will force you to use a system where \"a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.\" Biggest boos yet. Bureaucrats! Imagine.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Choice in schools. Choice in schools. No bureaucrats, just choice, lovely choice.</p> <p><strong>9.46pm</strong>: \"My fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades.\" NOT THE LADDER TO SPACE?!! Seriously?? All right. This is going to be cool. John McCain is going to build a ladder to space.</p> <p>Oh, hang on, it's energy independence.</p> <p>\"We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now.\" Drill, drill. \"Drill baby drill!\" the crowd shout, troublingly. </p> <p><strong>9.49pm</strong>: Terrorism time. Al Qaeda still poses a threat, and so does Russia. We must support the Georgians. \"We can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.\" There are lots of threats in this dangerous world and we should all be very scared, but John McCain isn't scared. He will fight.</p> <p>\"I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't.\" Feel the experience!</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong>: Wartime experiences, but not in much detail, and, by McCain standards, really not overplayed at all, nicely done. That can't be it, surely...?</p> <p><strong>9.54pm</strong>: \"The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.\" Not like Barack Obama, who has read too many self-help books and is on a journey of personal discovery.</p> <p>\"I have that record [of experience], and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.\"</p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: \"Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes...\" Ah, OK, that part before wasn't all there was. After a bit on accountability and bipartisanship, we're into the details of his prisoner-of-war experiences. He'd been a selfish young man, but when he was dumped in a dark cell in Hanoi and left to die.\" Crowd is yelling, weeping. McCain is going into detail about the violence he suffered in captivity.</p> <p><strong>10.01pm</strong>: \"When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with.\" Powerful stuff; standing ovations from the crowd.</p> <p><strong>10.04pm</strong>: \"I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it.\" Anti-Obama, obviously.</p> <p>He's urging everyone to do public service, instead -- implicitly -- of whining about hope and change. Nothing brings greater happiness than serving a cause greater than yourself, eg., Getting John McCain Elected. \"I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.\" Fight fight fight!</p> <p>Fight for what's right! Fight for America! Stand up to defend America! Stand up! Fight! </p> <p>...And it's over. Wow, that was fighty, the end part.</p> <p><strong>10.07pm</strong>: Here's Cindy and John and the moosehunter, doing some Hillary Pointing. </p> <p><strong>10.09pm</strong> BALLOONS! I like balloons. Balloons are the whole point of American political conventions. The elitist Barack Obama didn't have any balloons, because he considered himself to be above them, and also because Invesco Field didn't have a roof, so a balloon drop was unfeasible. But maverick John McCain gives you balloons. (Two hundred thousand of them, apparently.) Balloons and confetti. Vote for John McCain, balloon maverick. </p> <p>They're playing Rhythm Is A Dancer now. Rhythm may be a dancer, but the Michigan delegation are not. </p> <p>Raising McCain. That song again.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> Well, that was underwhelming and underpowered. (Apart from the balloons.) I thought it was telling that he seemed only to be able to rouse the crowd to emotion by explicitly chanting \"fight!\", \"fight!\". The distancing-from-Bush part, and the attack on the party, really didn't seem to go down well. He was light on policy, and not \u2014 I thought, though it's a very personal thing \u2014&#xa0;particularly warm or personable at all. Will tonight's performance drain some of the Palinthusiasm from the party faithful? We'll have to see.</p> <p><a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213710.php\">TPM:</a> \"I'm insulted that McCain uses a lifeless speech to hide his lack of specific policy proposals.\"<br><a href=\"http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/the_speech_2.html\">Swampland:</a> \"Mixed performance\" \u2014 Jay Carney also notes how much more excited and powerful McCain is when he's talking about something that excites him, namely, fighting.</p> <p>They're playing <a href=\"http://www.lyricsdownload.com/sly-and-the-family-stone-everyday-people-lyrics.html\">Everyday People</a>, now. Anti-elitist music.</p> <p><strong>10.31pm</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=interview_with_mccain_heckler\">An interview</a> with one of the protestors dragged from the hall, who turns out to be a Ron Paul supporter.</p> <p>...My colleague Richard Adams points out a significant quotation I missed in the frenzy of liveblogging \u2014&#xa0;a line that might not please immigration-hardliner Republicans: \"We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.\"</p> <p>I also failed to notice his reference earlier to how the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan \"is going to get back to basics.\" This reference <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_Basics_(campaign)\">sits ill with Brits</a>...</p> <p>Right, off to talk to delegates now.</p> <p>====</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p><strong>11.15pm</strong>: Interesting... With the caveat that this means nothing at all, I just spent a few moments mingling with delegates and their guests streaming out of the convention hall, and the contrast with last night couldn't be much starker. They weren't pumped up at all; almost everyone to whom I spoke felt the need to offer some kind of apology or justification for McCain's poor performance tonight. </p> <p>The very first person I stopped, Jerrod Atkinson from Dallas \u2014 a guest of the Texas delegation, not a delegate himself \u2014 said: \"Terrible. It was just full of emptiness, and what I see as empty promises. Any time I saw a stance, it wasn't a Republican stance. I really, really liked Sarah Palin's speech. I kinda wish we could have reversed the ticket: Palin/McCain. But apparently it's too late for that...\"</p> <p>But to be fair, he was the exception: everyone else delivered some kind of praise. \"I thought it communicated the essence of John McCain: he's sincere, and he's dedicated,\" said Karen Pausman, a Texas delegate (in regulation Stars-and-Stripes shirt and cowboy hat). She'd been impressed with McCain's remarks on energy policy. \"He never has been a strong speaker, but he had a lot of content. He has the gravitas to say I've put my money where my mouth is for my country.\" Which was better, McCain's speech, or Palin's? \"Palin's a better \u2014 I'm thinking of the right word \u2014 Palin's a better entertainer,\" she said. </p> <p>Paul Kramer, also a Texas delegate: \"He addressed the one thing we're concerned with most, which is our safety as Americans in the world. That's what's most important to us. We're facing a group that's set on our destruction as much as Adolf Hitler was.\" </p> <p>Fred Radewagen, a Hawaiian delegate, on the contrast between Palin and McCain: \"You can't compare apples and oranges.\"</p> <p>====</p> <p><strong>11.25pm</strong> Here endeth the liveblogging of the 2008 Democratic and Republican conventions. Tomorrow I'll fly back to elitist Washington, DC to sip on elitist coffee drinks. My regular Campaign Diary <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman/\">blog</a> continues. And of course there'll be more liveblogging at the debates. Or perhaps before. Thanks for reading and commenting. Now I must sleep.</p>"
