Me, I'm getting the wine in - Tim Atkin recommends these to go with Allegra's recipe: 2007 Tesco Finest Fiano, Sicily (\u00a35.99)2007 Br\u00fcndlmayer Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, Berg Vogelsang, Kamptal (\u00a312.99, Waitrose) - while my friend is coming round to shout out Allegra's instructions to my partner, Phil, who is our designated cook. I can already imagine just how much we're going to get on his nerves.</p> <p>So, come 8pm, Allegra will begin imparting her \"living recipe\", line by line. She'll be doing the cooking in her house and her lovely partner Susi will be typing it all out and sharing pictures of each stage of cooking with us all so we can check progress as we go along. </p> <p>Allegra has chosen an all inclusive simple and very tasty non-meat dish, so everyone should be able to complete this with little trouble. It should take around 30-40 minutes in all. And if anyone is having trouble, it's all in real time, so who better to shout questions at than the person who created the recipe? </p> <p>I'll just draw your attention to a couple of crucial prep notes:</p> <p>For the 150g dried fava beans - you'll want to be soaking them tonight - and remember to reserve the water. If you don't find yourself with fava beans or the time with which to prepare them however, you can use a tin of chickpeas with great success. Other alternatives for harder to find ingredients: sugar or honey can be substituted for fructose, as can tamarind block for tamarind paste.</p> <p>Post any questions below, now. Make sure you capture your efforts on camera (like you don't have enough to do with checking the blog and cooking a meal) - both the process and the finished product (Flickr users can tag pictures \"living recipe\" and send them to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/wordofmouth/\">our group</a>) and we'll assemble the lot to see how we all went.</p> <blockquote> <p><br><strong>This \"living recipe\" serves four</strong></p> <p>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil<br>1 aubergine<br>1 onion, sliced<br>2 cloves garlic, chopped<br>1 big green chilli<br>1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>Half teaspoon ground coriander<br>1 teaspoon turmeric<br>1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds<br>1 x 400g tin chopped plum tomatoes<br>1 large green pepper, cut into bite size pieces<br>30g fructose (or you can use sugar or honey - amounts tbc)<br>1 heaped tablespoon tamarind paste (or use tamarind block, amounts tbc)<br>150g dried fava beans (soaked overnight - reserve the water) OR a tin of chickpeas<br>300g tomatoes, cut into eighths<br>a small handful of mint, roughly chopped<br>salt and pepper<br>Greek yoghurt</p> <p>2 tablespoons currants<br>Half a teaspoon ground allspice<br>1 heaped teaspoon chopped dill<br>1 large spring onion, sliced<br>One and a half tablespoon extra virgin olive oil<br>250g brown basmati rice<br>500 ml vegetable stock<br>salt</p> <p><strong>Tim Atkin's wine recommendations</strong> </p> <p>2007 Tesco Finest Fiano, Sicily (\u00a35.99)<br>2007 Br\u00fcndlmayer Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, Berg Vogelsang, Kamptal (\u00a312.99, Waitrose)</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Twenty-five years ago, John Evans made history when he moved out of residential care into his own flat. In doing so, he was paving the way for thousands of other people with disabilities to follow suit and, now, for the government's personalisation agenda that has the potential to transform the lives of not only disabled people, but all those needing care and support.</p> <p>Other disabled people had got out of residential homes before Evans. The difference in his case was that his move to independent living was funded by his local authority, Hampshire county council, albeit in a roundabout and (at the time) technically unlawful way. As Evans is the first to admit, his story features many unsung and often unlikely heroes.</p> <p>Today, when personalisation and personal budgets are discussed, the impression is often created that it is a wholly new agenda that has come out of nowhere in the past four or five years. In fact, its source lies in the independent living movement forged by disabled people like Evans: a direct line can be traced back from 2008's personal budget holders to a day in 1979 when he and a group of four fellow residents of the Le Court Cheshire Home near Greatham, Hampshire, formed \"Project 81\", aiming to get themselves out of the home by 1981, which was to be the United Nations international year of disabled people.</p> <p>In the event, it took rather longer. Evans finally moved in December 1983 and all the Project 81-ers were out by the end of 1984. Le Court continued to be run as a care home by the charity Leonard Cheshire, but it was eventually closed last year and its residents relocated.</p> <p>Evans, who paid a return visit to Le Court shortly before its closure, has mixed emotions. \"It was the first Cheshire home and the most progressive,\" he says. \"The independent living movement came out of it and all that pioneering spirit has now gone, that's it. To me it still felt the same - institutional - but I did feel sad for those people who had gone there for the rest of their lives and had no control over what was going on.\"</p> <p><strong>Pioneering spirit</strong></p> <p>How Evans came to be in Le Court is undoubtedly of huge relevance. He was not born disabled, but broke his neck doing gymnastics while travelling in the US at age 25. \"I was brought up in the '60s, a bit of a rebel,\" he recalls. \"I was always independent, so [to end up in a care home] to me represented imprisonment. I was taken away from my roots, my family, my social contacts, everything.\"</p> <p>He had, in addition, two key experiences between his accident and going into the home. First, he spent five more months in the US, being treated in hospital but also coming into contact with the world's first centre for independent living in Berkeley, California. He in fact rejected an invitation to join it. Then, after further rehabilitation at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire, he spent 18 months with able-bodied friends in a cottage in the New Forest in a brave but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to re-establish himself in the community.</p> <p>Against that background, he was always unlikely to settle placidly at Le Court when he was accepted there in 1978. Twelve months after he arrived, he went to Oxford to meet a group of disabled students who were living in house with only unskilled support workers. Then, in 1981, Leonard Cheshire paid for him and a care attendant to fly to the US for six weeks to see independent living in action in Berkeley and elsewhere.</p> <p>\"The trip was an incredibly uplifting experience,\" says Evans. \"Everything I dreamed of, everything I thought of, there it was going on in front of my eyes. It cemented my approach to living independently and destroyed quite a few fears that were floating around in my mind.\"</p> <p>The role that Leonard Cheshire, and Hampshire council, played in encouraging and empowering Evans and the other members of the Project 81 \"escape committee\" (as the late disabled singer Ian Dury called them) has yet to be fully acknowledged. When Evans found the ground-floor maisonette in Petersfield that was to become his home, and where he still lives, the council agreed to get round the then law preventing a direct payment to him by \"laundering\" the money through Le Court. That arrangement, subsequently copied widely, persisted from 1983 until direct payments were at last made lawful in 1997.</p> <p>There was a wobble in 1986, when the county solicitor and county treasurer got cold feet about the artifice. By a stroke of good fortune, at exactly the same time the Audit Commission published an influential report, Making a Reality of Community Care, that praised Hampshire's approach and questioned the legal objection to it. A second wobble came in 1992 when the Department of Health issued a circular instructing councils to stop all direct payments: many councils did so, but Hampshire held its nerve.</p> <p>Evans now gets financial support from both Hampshire - directly - and the Independent Living Funds. He employs three personal assistants (PAs), who work a rota, and a driver when he needs to travel. He calls on other support as and when needed, including former PAs who accompany him on the frequent overseas trips he makes as part of his international work on independent living and disability rights.</p> <p>He works as a consultant on equality and diversity issues and is currently engaged by the Department of Health to advise on centres for independent living. Among many other roles, he acts as an \"expert by experience\" for the Commission for Social Care Inspection, sitting on its quality board and occasionally joining inspections of care facilities. Some are good, he accepts, but the prospect of returning himself to live in a residential home fills him with dread. \"The spectre of institutional care haunts us all,\" he says. \"I want to live in my own home until I die.\"</p> <p><strong>Minimum regulation </strong></p> <p>Evans is pleased that Hampshire, after a period during which he feels it lost direction, is once again seeking to take a lead on adult care reform. The council has set up an independent commission of inquiry into personalisation, which is expected to report next month. Evans hopes that the council, in acting on the inquiry recommendations, will be as bold as it was in 1983 - particularly in seeking to broaden personal budgets to include NHS money.</p> <p>On the key issues of debate around personalisation, he is broadly for \"minimum regulation\" of personal budgets and PAs - \"I've only had three or four problems in 25 years and no-one's ever run off with my money\" - and would back the right of any budget holder who wanted to use it to pay family members to support them, though he has misgivings about trapping people in caring roles. \"If you are talking about choice and control, and people want their family to do it, you have to respect that,\" he says, \"But we have to come up with some clear guidelines.\"</p> <p>He worries more about wider family involvement in handling budgets and direct payments, saying: \"The danger is that the individual, especially if they have a learning disability, does not have control over their life because their family is taking over. This is going to be a particular problem in [ paternalistic countries], as this idea spreads.\"</p> <p>Above all, and in common with many observers, Evans is concerned that the personalisation drive has come at a downpoint in the economic cycle and, now, amid a spectacular banking crash. \"The philosophy of the government is wonderful,\" he says, \"But with local authorities going to be so tightly restricted financially, unless more money does come somehow, it's just not clear how it's all going to go forward.\"</p> <p><strong>CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 58</p> <p><strong>Lives: </strong>Petersfield, Hampshire</p> <p><strong>Status: </strong>Single</p> <p><strong>Education: </strong> Dynevor school, Swansea; Open University (foundation courses in social sciences and arts)</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> 1991-present: freelance disability equality trainer</p> <p><strong>Honorary posts:</strong> Board member, European Network of Independent Living; board member, European Disability Forum; former chair, British Council of Disabled People; joint founder, Hampshire Centre for Independent Living</p> <p><strong>Interests: </strong>Nature, independent cinema, music, good food and wine</p>",
  "<p>There is no obligation to care for sick, elderly or disabled parents or adult relatives in the UK. And our system is \"carer-blind\" - if you are an adult needing care, you are offered a service based only on your level of need, and not on how much unpaid family caring you may have access to. </p> <p>Both those statements are true, legally speaking. But any family affected by caring issues will tell you that both are nonsense in any practical sense. We have a system that pretends to be carer-blind but is not. Working with ever more limited resources, of course care managers consider every unpaid care alternative. </p> <p>There is nothing wrong with taking into account family caring resources - there would be no point in offering services that we knew would duplicate what the family was happy to provide for free. But because the system is entirely focussed on individuals, it ends up being family-blind - unable to recognise and support the complex mix of care needs in many families, at the same time as recognising and supporting the equally complex mix of potential caring roles within that family. </p> <p><strong>Culture change </strong></p> <p>Where direct payments or individual budgets work well, it is often because the people involved in planning a care package have looked beyond that word \"individual\". But in our work with more than 350,000 carers, The Princess Royal Trust for Carers (PRTC) hears too many accounts of how budgets and resources have been pooled only at a very individual level. </p> <p>For instance, Dave (not his real name), an adult with a learning disability who attended a day centre five days a week, was approached about direct payments and told about the control and the freedom he would have. By the time his family was told about the proposal, Dave was enthusiastic about it and the family felt obliged to agree. He now has a personal assistant, but it transpires that the cash allocation can pay for only four days a week and for no holiday or sickness back-up when his assistant is unable to work. His mother agrees that he has a more fulfilling life, but she has had to reduce her hours at work and limit her own career aspirations. </p> <p>Arguably, Dave's local authority has applied the mechanisms of personalisation without making the culture change implied in the Putting People First concordat that underpins the social care transformation agenda. This did not envisage trade-offs between one person's choice and another's. One solution would be to consider extending the logic of budget pooling at an individual level towards giving families the choice to receive a whole-family assessment and a single budget allocation.</p> <p>As things stand, there is a paradox at the heart of our apparently \"carer-blind\" system: the more care you provide as a family, the less support you are likely to receive. And this appears to give the Treasury a win that's best left well alone. Why provide expensive replacement care when a family could be doing it for free? </p> <p>There are 1.25 million people taking on 50 or more hours a week of care; estimates of the amount that carers save the Exchequer run into tens of billions of pounds. What is not accurately known, however, is how quickly many of those heavy caring roles collapse. We do know that 80% of carers say it damages their health and surveys suggest that half of all carers give up work to care, with many spending years getting back into employment or never returning to earning. By thinking about individuals, rather than whole families, we squander the country's largest full-time care workforce. </p> <p><strong>Formal evaluation </strong></p> <p>It may be better for both families and the state's spiralling care budgets to put a greater formal value on the provision of care. Rather than valuing contribution as the current carers' allowance does, at a flat rate of \u00a350.55 a week, we would do better to allow families to plan for the real caring expectations placed upon them and to bank the contributions they are willing to make in return for a proportionate package of out-of-pocket expenses, breaks, emotional support and comprehensive back-up from health and care agencies. </p> <p>By placing a real value on care, we might be able to offer families genuine choices about how much cash and how much care they contribute to the system. Support for carers, particularly the advice, information and support in planning for emergencies, should remain non-means tested in order to motivate more people to take on caring roles that they can sustain, with commensurate savings to the economy. At present, such support is limited to areas with third-sector carers' centres, such as the 144 in the PRTC's network; it should be universal. </p> <p>But should we be thinking about going still further? With the social care budget deficit standing officially at \u00a36bn, and rising, will we need to accept changes that move us towards the systems in France and Germany, where families are placed under legal obligations to care for, or pay for the care of, their elderly parents? </p> <p>While the cash contribution required by individuals towards their care has been a prominent debating point in the run-up to the government's green paper on the future of adult care and support, less has been said about the need to define the in-kind contribution that forms the unwritten part of the contract between state and family. Formal caring obligations would be unpoliceable and would be fiercely resisted by many - but perhaps not so strongly by the thousands of families who already feel obliged to give up income, independence and health to care without recognition.</p> <p>Moreover, such obligations might be more acceptable to the nation's 6 million carers if, in return, they were to receive a package of support that enabled them to experience what the government's new national carers' strategy calls: \"A caring system on your side. A life of your own\".</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Fox is director of policy and communications at The Princess Royal Trust for Carers: <a href=\"http://www.carers.org\">carers.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Placed in prison and dispatched to the Eritrean army for his faith in Pentecostal Christianity, 18-year-old Mussie Haile remembers escaping from a military base and crossing the border to Sudan by foot. \"It took me three days because I was hiding in the day and walking at night,\" he recalls. </p> <p>In December 2006, he arrived in London and went into foster care. Six months later, he was handed a digital camera and invited to compose a visual documentation of his new life in the capital, with the assistance of photojournalist Crispin Hughes. Fourteen young asylum seekers and refugees, originating from Afghanistan to Angola, were also teamed up with a photographic mentor and asked to engage in a three-month-long dialogue with their newfound surroundings.</p> <p>A series of intimate thoughts and images are recorded in New Londoners: Reflections on Home, a book launched this week at the Tate Modern. Affectionate portraits of social workers as well as observational, community photographs, illustrate the refugees' integration at play, while forlorn landscapes and symbolic objects offer an introspective view of life through a newcomer's lens. </p> <p>\"I haven't been alone before,\" says Haile, who lives in Ilford and has secured refugee status for the following five years. While we look through a collection of his selected photographs: an ironing board, a bowl of pasta, a self-portrait conveying a state of pensiveness, he explains: \"I wanted to clarify my loneliness and to describe how the way of life changes from time to time or from place to place.\"</p> <p>Hughes observes how most of the captions accompanying Haile's images make reference to a former life in the Zoba Maekel district of Eritrea. \"I think he's got a poetic sensibility,\" Hughes adds. He recalls how in the book, Haile describes a ceiling lamp as \"a bulb with protection\". \"It's a bit like the Martian School of Poetry; you see a familiar object and you describe it in a way that's unfamiliar and give everybody a new view of things. Somebody like that can show us things about our own society and make us question our presumptions about our own life, and partly, our own affluence.\"</p> <p>Drawn to the project as someone with roots in community photography, Hughes was careful not to allow the mentorship to get confused with any sort of therapeutic relationship. \"So I never at any point asked probing questions to Haile about his trauma or his background and he seemed perfectly happy to treat this as a job to be done sort of thing,\" says Hughes.</p> <p>While other participants established a deeper bond with the medium of photography \u2013 in some cases setting out related career goals \u2013 Haile saw it more as a gift to offer. \"I want to participate in a friend's wedding, to make them happy. I want to share my skill with whom I want,\" he says. </p> <p>PhotoVoice, an organisation that encourages vulnerable groups to express themselves through photography, worked on the New Londoners project with east London-based Dost, which supports vulnerable children through education, advocacy and therapeutic support, as well as creative outlets. Dost's founder and director, Yesim Deveci, listens to a more confident, ever focused Haile as he outlines his plan to study medicine after completing his GCSEs at Havering College.</p> <p>Of his photographic journey, Deveci says: \"For me, it doesn't look so much like Mussie has changed but that he has more tools to use now.\" </p> <p>Similarly, New Londoners: Reflections on Home can hopefully inspire understanding and integration.</p> <p>\u2022 New Londoners: Reflections on Home is available at the <a href=\"http://www.photovoice.org\">PhotoVoice website</a>.

  "<p>Is there a metaphor for the fortunes of the Australian cricket team in the global economy, I wonder? Think of all the boom times, when opponents were routinely dispatched with such ease that it must have become tedious. It was certainly no time to be a Pom turning up in Australia, hearing as we did each time the patronising plea \"Jeez mate, I hope you blokes can put up a bit of a show this time.\"</p> <p>Well, remember the good days because there will be fewer of them in the future - the recession is here and it would not have needed Robert Peston to forecast it. The quality of the Australian player base seems to be eroding as fast as the Suffolk coastline while Cricket Australia is said to be so devoid of funds (not yet bankrupt but heading that way, I was told recently by someone who would know) that they need to cling on to the coat-tails on any Indian deals they can to stay afloat. They are in hock to Lalit Modi now.</p> <p>The defeat in Mohali should have come as a surprise to no one, only its magnitude. India's victory by 320 runs was the largest, in terms of runs alone, inflicted by them on anyone in 76 years of cricket history, and 98 runs better than their previous best against Australia, three decades and a thousand Tests ago. Only five times previously have Australia fared worse than this week.</p> <p>Of course this does not immediately render the wearers of the Baggy Green as a bunch of duffers. These things are relative, and it is only the second defeat suffered by Australia in 27 Test matches (I don't count the International Cricket Council exhibition thing in 2005, I'm afraid) since the Ashes series of that year.</p> <p>But there has been a trend: 18 matches won and one drawn up to the start of this year; three won, three drawn and two lost (both to India) since then. The old Australia, or even a fairly recent one, would have taken the first Test in Bangalore and steamrollered a win. They could do it in their sleep. Instead they allowed India off the hook. Zaheer Khan, was it, who commented that he had never witnessed an Australian team play so defensively? That would have hurt.</p> <p>The reasons for the decline are for the most part self-evident. No team can afford to lose a whole bunch of giants in such a short period and expect things to stay the same: Steve Waugh, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist are irreplaceable. Justin Langer and Jason Gillespie are both not far behind. It is possible to go back further and point to the retirement of Mark Waugh as the moment that a downturn began for when it is the fractions of percentage points that make a difference, the loss of the finest slip fielder of them all must by definition lead to a lowering of standards.</p> <p>Without those ingredients, and with nothing close to replacements, it was always going to be necessary to re-evaluate the way games would be played. Gilchrist for example, the great get-out-of-jail card, allowed batting bravado higher in the order. With Warne and McGrath, successive captains rarely lost control. These are pragmatic times for most teams and Australia are back in the pack with the pragmatists.</p> <p>It must be such a struggle for Ricky Ponting, who inherited the family business on the downturn. The impetus and aura from a decade of superiority has kept things rolling, but the captain is surely too long in the game not to have had an underlying concern. Many of them have manifested in the last few weeks on the subcontinent: the flawed character that has been seen in Andrew Symonds; the lack of a credible spin option (Cameron White's delivery into a different postcode, as his team lost control in Mohali, could have happened to anyone with sweaty hands but it is still a pratfall); Matthew Hayden's bullying dominance heading for an inevitable end; Ponting's own struggles particularly against the inspired youngster Ishant Sharma.</p> <p>Injuries are kicking in and further disrupting, and while the Indian seamers have reverse-swung the ball wickedly there is little evidence that Troy Cooley, the Australia bowling coach, has revealed to his own pacemen the secrets that he was employed to impart. The edge seems to have gone from Brett Lee too, his well-publicised spat with the captain the other day just further grist to the mill of a side in turmoil.</p> <p>There are still two Tests to go against India and the chance remains that Australia can turn things around, but you would not bet on it. Ponting simply has not got the bowling and it will need more than runs to take this series. A dose of realism rather than blind optimism garnered from deeds of the past would help as well. A month or so ago, another outfit, pre-eminent in its field, thought itself omnipotent.

It is not illegal to accept a donation from a registered UK company, but could be in breach of section 61 of the 2000 political parties law to enter into or \"act in furtherance of\" an arrangement which disguised an overseas donation. </p> <p>In his detailed statement last night, Osborne insisted that at no point did he or Feldman \"suggest ways of channelling a donation\".</p> <p>Rothschild, an old and close friend of Osborne, has gone public after he became enraged at the way in which the shadow chancellor had abused his hospitality. He was furious that Osborne breached confidences about his conversations with Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, while the politicians were private guests at Rothschild's luxury Corfu villa in August. </p> <p>Osborne has been seen as the source of malicious newspaper stories that Mandelson had poured poison about Gordon Brown in private conversations, and also that Mandelson held potentially controversial meetings with Deripaska on his \u00a318m yacht, moored near the villa of Rothschild, a friend and business partner of Deripaska. </p> <p>On a day when some of the biggest political reputations at Westminster were at stake, it became clear that Rothschild, the son of the merchant banker, was so infuriated by Osborne's discourtesy that he was prepared to wreck their friendship. This prompted Tory claims that Mandelson, bent on revenge, must have manipulated Rothschild into causing Osborne such a political embarrassment. At lunchtime yesterday, Osborne issued a limited denial of Rothschild's claims by saying he had not solicited money from Deripaska, and no money had been taken. \"We did not ask for any money, we did not receive any,\" he said. </p> <p>Sources close to Rothschild immediately insisted this limited denial obscured the fact Osborne and Feldman had enthusiastically discussed the possibility of securing the donation from Deripaska. Rothschild accepts there was no direct conversation with the Russian, but says the Conservatives had discussed the issue with him.</p> <p>By mid-afternoon, Osborne issued a fuller statement admitting he had met Deripaska four times in one weekend in Corfu, and that in the presence of Rothschild, Feldman and two other witnesses had indeed discussed a donation from Deripaska. But he portrayed Rothschild as the initiator of the discussion.</p> <p>Osborne said that in the discussion on the terrace of the villa: \"Rothschild suggested to Feldman that his friend Mr Deripaska could be interested in making a donation.\" Osborne in his account said: \"Feldman at this point made clear there are very strict rules on donations to political parties in the UK. Feldman explained a political donation is only lawful if you appear as an individual on the UK electoral roll, or if the donation comes from a legitimate UK trading company.\" </p> <p>At this point, according to Osborne's account, \"Rothschild said that Mr Deripaska owned UK trading companies including Leyland Daf\", a Midlands-based vehicle firm. He insisted \"there was no discussion about how a donation could be concealed or channelled\". </p> <p>If a donation had come from the Leyland Daf board, ordered by Deripaska, it would have been highly arguable whether it was lawful since the company might have been acting as an agent for a foreign donor. </p> <p>After the discussion at the villa, Rothschild arranged for Osborne and Feldman to go aboard Deripaska's yacht in his company, but Osborne insists no discussion of a donation occurred at this one-hour meeting, even though Feldman, the party's chief fundraiser and an old school friend of Cameron, was present. </p> <p>Allies of Rothschild appeared last night to corroborate this account. Osborne insists he had no further conversations on a donation, but he says Rothschild suggested in a phone call on September 18 with Feldman that Leyland Daf was interested in making a donation.</p> <p>According to the Tory account, Feldman at this point considered whether such a donation would be appropriate and after discussion with party officials decided it would not be, so ending the possibilty. </p> <p>Allies of Deripaska weighed in against Osborne's implication that he initiated talks, saying the billionaire \"has never donated to any political party in Britain and he has no intention of doing so\".</p> <p>Last night <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/22/georgeosborne-oleg-deripaska\">Rothschild further challenged</a> details of Osborne's version of events, saying he had discussed the possibility of a donation from the oligarch via Daf with Osborne before they met Deripaska. In further conflict with Osborne's story, he said the issue of a donation was again raised in talk on Deripaska's yacht. </p> <p>After the meeting on the yacht, Rothschild claims the subject was raised again over dinner and \"Osborne was interested in whether and how such a donation could be secured\". He also claims the Tories were still interested when he raised the issue with Feldman in September. Rothschild said: \"I was left with the impression the Conservative party remained interested.\" He added that another guest at his villa, James Goodwin, a consultant, was willing to corroborate his account.</p> <p>Friends of Rothschild last night defended his behaviour, and his decision to stand by Mandelson, a friend for 10 years, rather than Osborne, his older friend and closer political ally. </p> <p>One said: \"There is a long history in British politics in which people from other political parties meet and discuss the state of their parties and remain discreet about it. He [Rothschild] is doubly angry in that his mother had been funding Osborne's office for years.\" </p> <p>Cameron fully backed Osborne, who may yet face questioning for failing to declare he and his family had stayed at Rothschild's villa. He said: \"At no point did he ask for any money and the Conservative party didn't receive any money. That is the absolutely vital point.\"</p>",
  "<p>India and Pakistan opened a trade route across divided Kashmir for the first time in 60 years yesterday, in an attempt to bring a peace dividend to the Himalayan region that in recent months has seen an upsurge of anti-Indian rioting and heavy firing between the two nations' troops. </p> <p>In the past few years India has been reluctant to open the Kashmiri border, believing it would see an influx of Islamic militants from Pakistan. Indian Kashmir has been scarred by violent insurgency since 1989 and peace is kept by hundreds of thousands of soldiers. But the violence has fallen sharply since the nuclear-armed states began a peace process in 2004.</p> <p>Yesterday, fruit, nuts and honey were transported from Indian Kashmir, while Pakistani Kashmiri traders sent rice and rock salt across the de facto border. Security was tight as hundreds gathered on both sides - symbolising a wish for an end to the dispute that has led to three wars.</p> <p>The lorries with their trade will be taking the same route as the bus service that links Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, to Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani Kashmir. The visiting traders are expected to drive just a few miles inside rival territory and unload, from where other resident drivers will take over. Trade will be limited to one day a week.</p> <p>\"It is a big leap forward,\" said Mubeen Shah, president of India's Kashmir chamber of commerce.\"We will be sending 11 truck-loads across the Line of Control.\"</p> <p>The new administration of Pakistan has surprised many in India with its emphasis on building trust through trade. President Asif Zardari has said he wants to see Pakistani-stitched jeans and Pakistani cement sold in India. \"There is no other economic survival for nations like us. We have to trade with our neighbours first,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Western concerns about global energy markets hit new heights last night when Russia, Iran and Qatar said they were forming an Opec-style gas cartel.</p> <p>The move by the three countries, which control 60% of the world's gas reserves, was met with immediate opposition from the European commission, which fears the group could drive up prices.</p> <p>Alexey Miller, chairman of Russia's Gazprom, said they were forming a \"big gas troika\" and warned that the era of cheap hydrocarbons had come to an end.</p> <p>\"We are united by the world's largest gas reserves, common strategic interests and, which is of great importance, high cooperation potential in tripartite projects,\" he explained. \"We have agreed to hold regular - three to four times a year - meetings of the gas G3 to discuss the crucial issues of mutual interest.\"</p> <p>Miller's comments, likely to increase pressure on the west to accelerate developments in wind and other renewable energy alternatives, followed a meeting in Tehran with Gholamhossein Nozari, Iran's petroleum minister, and Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, Qatar's deputy prime minister and oil and energy minister. </p> <p>Miller said the group was establishing a technical committee comprised of specialists and experts to discuss the implementation of joint projects embracing the entire value chain from geological exploration to marketing.</p> <p>The Russians avoided the word cartel but the Iranians spelled it out clearly. \"There is a demand to form this gas Opec and there is a consensus to set up gas Opec,\" Nozari told a news conference. </p> <p>With Opec due to meet on Friday to look at ways of driving up oil prices, Miller said fossil fuels were going to cost more. \"We share the opinion that oil price fluctuations don't put in question the fundamental thesis stating that the era of cheap hydrocarbons has come to an end.\"</p> <p>The European commission said last night that it would oppose the creation of any organisation that could restrict competition. \"The European commission feels that energy supplies have to be sold in a free market,\" said its spokesman, Ferran Tarradellas Espuny.</p> <p>The west already suspects that Russia and Iran are happy to use energy to pursue political goals. The cutting off of gas by Moscow to Ukraine in the middle of a political and commercial spat caused outrage and worry in western Europe.</p> <p>For its part, Iran, in its stand-off with world powers over its nuclear programme, has threatened to choke off oil shipments through the Persian Gulf if it is attacked.</p> <p>A gas cartel could extend both countries' reach in energy and politics, particularly if oil prices bounce back to the highs seen this year, prompting politicians, businesses and consumers to look toward cleaner-burning natural gas and other alternative fuels.</p> <p>The gathering in Iran needs to be ratified by further meetings in Qatar and Russia but is the most significant step toward the formation of such a group since Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, raised the idea in January 2007.</p> <p>The European Union depends on Russia for nearly half of its natural gas imports. Moscow, which controls many of the pipelines from Russia and central Asia, already has a tight hold on supplies.</p> <p>\"To try to manoeuvre the supply makes perfect sense,\" said James Cordier, president of the US-based Liberty Trading Group and OptionSellers.com. \"Just because it doesn't have the clout of oil, it's still in their best interest to deliver natural gas where it needs to go and manage supply in order to help manage the price.\"</p> <p>Liquefied natural gas, a rapidly growing segment of the market, could be traded as a commodity similar to oil and the move by Russia, Iran and Qatar appears to anticipate that, said Konstantin Batunin, an analyst with Moscow's Alfa Bank.</p> <p>\"My take is that it is just a commitment to create something in the future,\" he said. \"It's just a first step.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Sheila Rowbotham was refused her request to stay on as a professor of gender and labour history at Manchester University earlier this year, she wasn't expecting an outcry. The university's decision could have been seen as a little mean-spirited - after all, it came not long after their employment of Martin Amis on a part-time salary of \u00a380,000 - but Rowbotham was reaching the retirement age of 65, and it is hardly unusual to enforce a contract.</p> <p>So Rowbotham was astonished when the Save Sheila campaign started spreading. Colleagues across the country wrote to the university demanding that she be kept on. Emails poured in from academics in Ireland, Spain, Italy, France, Finland, Israel, Holland, India and the US. Rowbotham's students set up a Save Sheila site on Facebook. As one colleague put it, \"she is our very own icon\".</p> <p>Rowbotham says that the response left her \"overwhelmed. I don't think I have good stamina for battling with institutions. But I was really moved by it all, particularly the backing of the students. I was interviewed on local television with some of them, and, while I looked rather ghostly, they were wonderfully fresh and alive!\" </p> <p>Now, with a new professorial title and funding, Rowbotham is back at Manchester, and, with hindsight, the battle to save her seems unsurprising. Rowbotham is one of Britain's most important, if unshowy, feminist thinkers, and a key figure of the second-wave. She was among the organisers of that landmark event, the first National Women's Liberation Conference, in 1970, which led to the announcement of the four still hugely relevant demands of the movement: equal pay; equal education and opportunity; 24-hour nurseries; free contraception and abortion on demand. Rowbotham says she imagined this as the start of \"an entirely new kind of politics - no leaders, no ego trips, no more sectarian disputes. We were going to be concerned with working-class women's lives - not just the privileged - and it was going to be about bread and roses.\" The reality was \"in some ways much more than we imagined, and, in some ways, very much less.\"</p> <p>Rowbotham was born in 1943 to proud lower-middle-class Yorkshire parents, and she rebelled against her strict Anglican father at an early age, turning first to Methodism, and then to Marxism. Having won a place to study history at St Hilda's College, Oxford, she came into contact with some of the great leftwing minds of the time, including Eric Hobsbawm, E P Thompson and the economist Bob Rowthorn, with whom she had an intense love affair. In her early 20s, she spent a beatnik year in Paris, observing street politics, and narrowly escaping a brutal rape.</p> <p>But it was after plunging into radical politics in the 1960s that she began to consciously experience \"inward rustlings of resistance\". Recalling one of her first feminist articles, Rowbotham observes in her 2000 memoir, Promise of a Dream, \"I knew I must not write from received authorities but from my own observations and feelings. As the words splattered out on to the pages, it felt as if I had reached a clearing.\" Sexuality, trade unionism, birth control, wages, love: she brought these disparate concerns together in both her activism and writing. She still does.</p> <p>According to her friend and fellow academic, Lynne Segal, \"Sheila's early writing paved the way for feminist thought and scholarship in Britain\". In the early 1970s Rowbotham published three key books - Hidden from History; Women, Resistance and Revolution; and Woman's Consciousness, Man's World. In 1983, Simone de Beauvoir hailed her as one of the most interesting theorists then writing.</p> <p>But as feminism enlarged and divided, Rowbotham became uncomfortable. \"I wasn't good at being an individual star,\" she says. \"I just didn't enjoy it. It was a strain living up to others' ideas of what I should be like.\" And then there was what one male friend called her \"enormous heterosexual enthusiasm\", which alienated her from a sterner strain of radical feminism that attacked women's sexual relations with men.</p> <p>Come the 1980s, the rise of Thatcherism and Having It All feminism rendered Rowbotham's concerns with the struggles of poor, political women searingly unfashionable. But she soldiered on. She went to Manchester in the early 1990s, and in 2000 published her totemic cultural history, A Century of Women, which investigated the lives of everyone from politicians to cleaners.</p> <p>And now she is heading into the limelight again with her magisterial biography of Edward Carpenter, the 19th-century radical and gay campaigner. Rowbotham first discovered him as an idealistic student, and his work was a revelation; indeed, she was so intrigued by Carpenter and his contemporaries, that in 1997 she wrote a book about them, Socialism and the Common Life, with Jeffrey Weeks. But the charismatic Carpenter continued \"to lurk about in my head\", and she embarked on his biography in earnest in 2003. What interested her was that \"he linked so many different causes. He was a gay man, friendly with feminist women. He was opposed to vivisection, a socialist who supported animal rights. He was interested in mysticism, wrote for the Fabians but had anarchist sympathies ... He was a visionary who was very interested in practical solutions.\"</p> <p>Rowbotham has also been working on another major historical study. She explains that at the same time as the suffrage movement, there were many women who were also \"concerned about welfare reform, active in local government - anarchist, socialist - who envisaged that it was possible to reorganise work, domestic labour and architecture. Women like Sylvia Pankhurst who took over a pub for cooperative childcare and called it The Mother's Arms, and Margaret Ashton who created a hostel for homeless women ... In their attempt to create a more social world, they remind me of women campaigning in poor countries now.\"</p> <p>She admires the confidence of today's young feminists. \"I was at a seminar with Naomi Klein and she was very impressive. She just cut through the objections of a fairly formidable group of men from the old and new left, in a way that would have been difficult for someone of my generation. And she did it without thinking.\" Other things have been eroded though, she says. \"For instance, I would have assumed there was now an established interest in working-class women's history. But that's much less easy to write about these days ... It's not so difficult to talk about race and gender but surprisingly difficult to talk about class. It's like speaking into an empty space.\"</p> <p>Teaching has put Sheila back in touch with a young, politicised set, and in writing the book about Carpenter, she hopes to bring this radical of another generation alive for a modern audience. \"He is constantly vanishing, someone people have only half heard of. I would like people to discover him, to find the book relevant to things they're interested in now, to how people might live and how society could be.\"</p> <p>In resurrecting Carpenter's life and politics, Rowbotham has rescued an earlier strand of the rich socialist feminist tradition of which she is also such an important part. As the furore around her Manchester appointment showed, this lady is not for vanishing.</p> <p>\u2022 Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love by Sheila Rowbotham is published by Verso at \u00a324.99.

  "<h2>Tony Travers<br>Director, Greater London Group, London School of Economics</h2> <p>The 2009 spending review will herald a 10-year squeeze of public expenditure until 2017-18 or even longer, whoever wins the next general election. With lower growth and higher borrowing, the government is going to have to face the problem of putting taxes up and reducing public spending in order to get the economy to balance in the long term. The government won't want to be seen to featherbed the public sector. There will be fewer people unemployed in public services and fewer services provided. Even if councils rein in on social care for the elderly the growth in numbers will mean that overall expenditure will increase even if squeezed per unit. Local services such as street cleaning, urban projects and youth clubs will be hit, along with grants to voluntary organisations. Private-sector housing has stopped dead, along with the affordable homes provided through Section 106 deals, and during the last economic downturn the route government took was to spend on social housing. But caution is required before the wholesale municipalisation of private sector blocks that are nearing bankruptcy. Not all councils would be over the moon about getting large blocks of social housing. The mood of the time is to not to have estates full of poor people but to mix it up. Yet who is going to buy the shared ownership?</p> <h2>Ray Jones<br>Professor of social work, Kingston University and St George's, University of London</h2> <p>Gordon Brown didn't invite social care to the public sector spending party in recent years, but it will be amongst the first to be invited to the wake when the quality of life of disabled and older people and their family carers is being buried. It is easy for central government to hold back on the money it gives to local councils, and also to restrict councils from raising funding through council tax, something the Conservatives are already trumpeting as their intention. Councils then take the blame for withdrawing services. Councils will now reduce the money they pay to voluntary and private sector care organisations, who will lay off already lowpaid care workers. Disabled and older people will find the financial charges they have to pay to councils shooting up at the same time that the help they get is reduced. And the government's drive within its \"personalisation agenda\", to give more control to disabled and older people about how they are helped, will be about choosing how to cut their own care. Some choice! A lesson for the future would be to secure payments to disabled and older people through the rightsbased, publicly transparent social security system rather than the cash-capped, discretionary and therefore vulnerable local council social care budgets.</p> <h2>Ian Johnston<br>Chief executive, British Association of Social Workers </h2> <p>I think in a recession the demand for social workers would go up as the disastrous consequences begin to impact on people. The social problems that social workers deal with tend to get worse, or existing problems that people have become exacerbated. The link between poverty and social problems is well documented. If there was a recession there is no doubt that local councils would be affected and would have to reassess spending. However, with social workers, unlike many other types of public sector workers, there is a high level of vacancies. It has been this way for the last few years and it has been running at about 12.5% across the country. It's hard to know what will happen. I think we're all uneasy. But I'm certain demand for social workers' skills will increase because of the nature of recessions.</p> <h2>John Appleby <br>Chief economist, King's Fund </h2> <p>The NHS has done well financially over the last eight years. Spending has more than doubled in real terms and annual real increases have been more than twice the long-run average since 1948. The spending boost was a political decision about priorities, which was made easier given a growing economy. Future prospects now look less rosy. In the short term, NHS funding has already been set up to the end of the current spending round in 2011. There's lower growth from this year, but it's still three to four per cent in real terms each year. On top of that, the NHS now has surpluses of over \u00a34bn. But after 2011 and up to 2014, it is hard to see the NHS enjoying much real growth in its funding. What was always going to be a tight spending round in 2010 is going to be very tight. Though no two recessions are ever the same, the NHS has been here before. In the late 1970s, 80s and 90s spending was eroded by inflation and/or funding limited by reduced government income. As then, for the next five years the NHS knows that it will have to make every healthcare pound count for more than in the past.</p> <h2>Heather Wakefield<br>Head of local government, Unison</h2> <p>There has been a steady stream of redundancies across councils that has nothing to do with the credit crunch but is the result of what is a Tory local government policy of keeping down council tax at any cost. In addition, councils have been required to make 3% year-on-year efficiency savings. Some have made double that. You can't look at any potential job losses in isolation. The personalisation agenda will impact on the council's domiciliary workers because people will be employing their own personal assistants. Since 1981 when we saw a lot of redundancies in local government, there has been a huge increase in the use of agency workers. Our research has found that councils in England alone spend \u00a32bn a year on agency staff. A big area is catering, cleaning and refuse collection, and also social care, where 78% of councils can't recruit and retain social workers. They could be easily disposed of but at what cost? In most local authority areas, the NHS and local government are the biggest employers, so it will have a knock-on effect on the local economy. The government can't have it both ways \u2014 high quality services and a slimmed down workforce.</p> <h2>Matthew Taylor<br>Chief executive, RSA</h2> <p>The government sees a growing public sector deficit as a necessary evil in an economic downturn. But with the figures spiralling and ordinary people cutting back, ministers will want to show they too can make sacrifices. There is a need for a reassessment of priorities, including taking a look at delivery areas like health and education and criminal justice, which have done so well in the last 10 years. There are few other big targets: Downing Street will not want to cut international development and the military have already started their briefing operation. One option would be to put programmes on hold for the next year or two, especially if they can be stopped without too much disruption. For example, ID cards could wait. It would be good politics for the government to give up some of its own favoured schemes. In other areas, changing circumstances may require a new look at priorities \u2014 for example should work and pensions funding move from the hardcore longterm unemployed to shorter-term job creation? But political reality being what it is, the most vulnerable spending will still be \"soft\" areas like local government, legal aid and regeneration.</p> <h2>Sophie Corlett<br>Policy director, Mind mental health charity</h2> <p> <br>Through welfare reform, the government has pledged to get one million people off benefits and into work, but with unemployment set to hit 2 million, the outlook is bleak. Many people with mental health problems face being moved from incapacity benefit on to the lower-rate jobseeker's allowance, on the government's promise of finding work. But there will be ever-fewer jobs available. This leaves people on jobseeker's allowance on a reduced income, with no job to go to; it leaves them in poverty. What prospect is there that people with mental health problems who have been unemployed for a long period will be among the lucky few that find work? The people who need the most support will be the easiest to sideline. If welfare reform presents a contract between the state and the individual, we need the government to keep its side of the bargain.</p>",

  "<p>Until recently, the word oligarch invariably conjured up the name of one rather rich Russian businessman, Roman Abramovich. The owner of Chelsea FC had become virtually synonymous with Russia's elite, embodying its foibles, excesses and passions. But in recent weeks <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oleg-deripaska\">Oleg Deripaska</a>, a 40-year-old metals tycoon and a friend of Abramovich, has dominated the headlines. This year Deripaska overtook Abramovich as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>'s richest man. In May Forbes Russia magazine estimated his fortune at $28.6bn (\u00a317bn). </p> <p>Deripaska's wealth derives from ownership of the world's largest aluminium producer, UC Rusal. In an interview with the Guardian last year, he shrugged off the suggestion he was Russia's leading tycoon. Asked how much he was worth, he replied: \"I don't know.\" But Deripaska's rise has not been without controversy. There have been claims - denied by the oligarch - of links to organised crime. In 2006 the US state department revoked his American visa. Deripaska has also been involved in a series of legal cases in the US and London, where a former partner, Michael Cherney, is suing him for $4bn in the high court.</p> <p>These acrimonious disputes date back to the 1990s when, as Deripaska puts it: \"The country was in a sort of decay.\" The Soviet Union had just collapsed. A new class of businessman - the oligarchs - ruthlessly carved up Russia's freshly privatised state industries. These included oil, gas and aluminium. Deripaska became embroiled in the struggle for control of an aluminium smelter in Sayanogorsk in Siberia. The battle was so vicious, and so corpse-strewn, it became part of privatisation legend, and dubbed the \"aluminium wars\". </p> <p>He dismisses claims that at one point his enemies tried to blow him up on a mountain road using a grenade launcher. \"It's a joke,\" he remarked. But his reputation for ruthlessness dates from this period when - it's not entirely clear how - he managed to overcome the local mafia.</p> <p>Like many super-wealthy Russians, Deripaska is a keen Anglophile. He has a \u00a320m house in Belgravia. He speaks fluent idiomatic English, learned while he studied theoretical physics at Moscow's state university. Deripaska's young son and daughter have also mastered the language, thanks to their English nanny. Asked about his view of the British, Deripaska said: \"They are very honest and decent people, very well educated.\" His also has interests in the UK: in 2006 his investment company Basic Element bought the ailing British van-maker LDV.</p> <p>Like many oligarchs, Deripaska has humble origins, growing up in a village in southern Russia with his widowed mother, an engineer. As a boy, he milked his family's cows and fed the ducks. </p> <p>He graduated just as science funding in post-communist Russia collapsed. Instead of physics, he went into business. In 1993-4 he accumulated a 20% stake in a Siberian aluminium factory. In 2000 Abramovich bought most of the holdings in Russia's aluminium industry and merged them with Deripaska's company. They created Rusal - Russian aluminium. Abramovich later sold his stake to Deripaska, leaving Deripaska the undisputed tsar of one of the world's most lucrative industries. </p> <p>Along the way, he has demonstrated a knack for cultivating the rich, powerful and important. In 2001 he married Polina Yumasheva - daughter of Boris Yeltsin's chief of staff Valentin Yumashev. Deripaska is also close to Vladimir Putin. At home Deripaska has keenly obeyed the key rule of the authoritarian Putin era: don't meddle in politics. As a result, his fortunes have prospered.</p>",
  "<p>Even if charity leaders successfully persuade the Treasury this week to bail out voluntary organisations that had deposited cash in Icelandic banks, these are tough times for charities. The economic downturn is likely to lead to a reining-in of council spending, and local authority grants and contracts may shrink. In addition, public and corporate donations will fall at a time when demand for charities' services is rising. </p> <p>Despite this, Stephen Bubb, head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations (Acevo), is bullish about the third sector's role in delivering public services. Why such optimism? Perhaps it is a speech given by work and pensions secretary James Purnell at an Acevo lecture a few days ago, in which he introduced the idea of a \"right to bid\" that would allow voluntary organisations to tender to run a public service if they thought they could do it better than the current provider. </p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Sweden - that supposed bastion of state welfare - is showing the way in attempts to open up public sector contracts to charities. Although 85% of public services there are still provided by the state, and of the remaining 15% just 2% are delivered by not-for-profit organisations, this is about to change. From January 1 2009, individuals will have the right to choose who provides them with services such as elderly care and home care. Under this new legislation the state still picks up the bill, but all Swedish local authorities will have to certify service providers from the public, private and third sectors that fulfil some basic criteria, and inform the public about the options available. </p> <p>According to Lars Pettersson, secretary general of Famna, an umbrella organisation for the Swedish third sector, the \"freedom of choice\" law is motivated by the implications for service quality, but also because previous methods of contracting out services greatly favoured big corporations. To avoid this marginalisation, the Swedish government and a coalition of 90 large third-sector organisations is striking an agreement this week - modelled on the Compact in the UK - to spell out the principles underpinning their future relationship. </p> <p>This ought to be good news for charities. However, the US experience - where the right to choose has been available for many years under Medicaid, a fee-based federal social insurance programme - rings alarm bells. A new Acevo publication paints a grim picture. Medicaid fees, says the report, have failed to rise in line with increased costs, are paid retrospectively, can be slow to reclaim, and do not take account of the added value that the third sector can provide.</p> <p>The result, says Seb Elsworth, Acevo's head of policy and one of the authors of the report, is that voluntary organisations delivering Medicaid services ape for-profit companies, and benefits of scale have forced greater collaboration, consolidations and mergers. </p> <p>So how do charities differentiate themselves from the private sector? Elsworth has a few suggestions: maintain a diverse income stream; calculate an accurate pricing model for services; invest in professional leadership; and develop outcome reporting that backs up oft-repeated, but largely unproven, claims about the benefits of the sector. By doing this, he is confident that UK charities will not go the way of their US counterparts. \"We can strike the balance between delivering highly professional services, which effectively compete with the private sector while retaining distinctive non-profit characteristics,\" he predicts. </p> <p>Easier said than done? The lesson to be drawn from this timely publication is that we should beware of viewing public service delivery as a panacea during an economic downturn, when donations and grant-funding are in short supply.</p> <p>\u2022 Alison Benjamin is deputy editor of Society Guardian.</p> <p>\u2022 Lessons from Abroad: The Third Sector's Role in Public Service Transformation is available, price \u00a320, at <a href=\"http://www.acevo.org \">acevo.org </a></p>",
  "<p>How tawdry, how craven and foolish, certain British politicians and their friends seem to have been this summer in Corfu. Leave aside for a moment the matter of who saw whom, and when, and on whose yacht or villa terrace, and whether party funding laws might have been broken as a result (though the details matter immensely to the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, whose career depends on them). The whole atmosphere of wealth and power, of big yachts and tycoons, seduced people whose claim to political importance depends on solid good judgment. The intersection of New Labour, new money and new Tories has been exposed. When the future business secretary or the shadow chancellor go wobbly at the knees at the prospect of a drink on a shiny boat with a Russian aluminium magnate, the whole of politics is demeaned. A public that is repeatedly urged not to be so sceptical is given another reason to doubt. </p> <p>Lord Mandelson can point out that, at the time he strolled up the Queen K's gangplank, he did not expect to rejoin the cabinet; that he was meeting a man he knew well (though that is not to his credit); and that nothing discussed on the boat could have shifted the European Union's policies on metals tariffs, settled by a great bureaucracy. Nor was he after a donation. Nonetheless, his willingness to associate with Oleg Deripaska, whose extreme wealth was acquired in the violent turmoil of post-Soviet Russia, reeks of the sort of thing that has brought him back to earth twice before. </p> <p>But of course such associations take place all the time. Corfu this summer seems to have been a sort of Davos-sur-Mer, a super-summit where political rivals dine together - and seek invitations to see Rupert Murdoch, who, inevitably, turns out to have been in the area. In this boys' club, normal rules do not apply. In the eyes of some Mr Osborne's sin seems to have been the fact that he blabbed to journalists, breaking a private code. But the talking is not the problem; it is what was discussed. Even on the kindest reading of the evidence, Mr Osborne has behaved with a reckless lack of sense.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor should not have chosen to spend time with Mr Deripaska. Having done so, he should not have become embroiled in discussion of a donation, even indirectly. His statement yesterday tried to snuff out scandal with an impenetrable mass of detail. But even if it is correct, two disturbing things emerge: first, that Mr Osborne was present at a discussion of how Mr Deripaska might donate - a donation that would have been illegal had it been made directly; and second, that once this idea had been raised he returned for a second visit to Mr Deripaska's yacht with Andrew Feldman, the Tory party chief executive, the man responsible for compliance with funding rules. It stretches imagination to accept that this second visit was simply a social call. Mr Osborne may have chatted about politics, education and Russian history, as he says. But Mr Feldman was present, aware of a possible big donor. They were building relationships. This was a potential distortion of funding law. In the end there was no donation - important to remember - and if there had been, Britain's feeble rules might have allowed it to be channelled through Mr Deripaska's British company LDV. But a party outraged by Labour's activities has been shown to be no better; as it is too by Lord Ashcroft and his still-uncertain tax status. </p> <p>Amid all the intricacies, what matters most is that politics is funded cleanly and fairly, and not to excess. Awash with private cash, the Tories threaten those principles. On Monday night the Commons debated proposals for funding reform. The case has never been stronger. Meanwhile Mr Osborne's future depends on it being accepted that his five meetings with Mr Deripaska were social ones. It is a ghastly position for a man who wants to take charge of the nation's finances.</p>",
  "<p>Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford professor, is a lawyer who gets things changed not for the benefit of corporations but to unleash the creative potential of ordinary people in a digital age. He founded Creative Commons, a non-profit organisation whose licences enable content creators to set their own terms for protection of their intellectual property. He regards extension of copyright as anathema to the YouTube generation and a brake on economic growth. He also thinks it is against the US constitution, which states that copyright should be \"limited\". The original limit has been extended from 14 to 70 years after the death of the creator, and Prof Lessig points out that one of the main corporations that lobbied for this, Disney, cut its creative teeth by raiding the public domain for works from Snow White to the Hunchback of Notre Dame. If the current term for copyright had existed then, it might have suffocated Mickey Mouse at birth. Prof Lessig is formidably qualified, with degrees in economics, management, philosophy and law, but it was only when he studied philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge, that his conservative views underwent radical change. His latest book, Remix: Making Art and Commerce Thrive in the Hybrid Economy, will enhance his cult status on the web. This year he launched a web-based campaign to get Congress members to take a stand against corruption. So far only five have signed up, but if - as is possible - Prof Lessig ends up in government then he will have less need to rely on persuasion.</p>",
  "<p>We are grateful the Guardian promptly expressed its solidarity with Roberto Saviano (In praise of ..., October 16). But this is not enough. An open threat has been made to his life for writing the film Gomorrah, a blistering indictment of the Camorra, the mafia clans of the Naples region, who now dominate international organised crime and have penetrated the formal economy and finance as well as the traditional illicit trades.</p> <p>They reach into the pockets of the lower middle class. They produce high-fashion labels in sweatshop conditions. They intimidate, terrorise and beggar the poor, dependent and unemployed in the neighbourhoods of north-eastern Naples. They poison the water table and air by illegally disposing of toxic waste. They control the imported produce from China and the far east. Clothes we wear, household goods we rely on, have passed through Naples port and Camorra hands to reach us. The Camorra operates throughout Europe and the world. So we cannot just pass it off as a problem of the backward south of Italy.</p> <p>The Camorra's threat to Roberto Saviano is an affront to the democratic integrity of Italian society but also a challenge to citizens everywhere. We need to assert our solidarity with Saviano and all those who have stood up to Camorra and mafia rule. Let us make a lot more noise spreading the message of the book and film, swelling the numbers to a veritable movement of popular opposition to Camorra and mafia terror, forcing the Italian state to intervene effectively to assert the democratic will of the people and defend the freedom of this courageous young investigative journalist to live and carry on writing. We also need to force on to the agenda of the EU international action to break the hold of organised crime cartels over the global economy and end their impunity.<br><strong>Jude Bloomfield, Franco Bianchini, Geoff Andrews, Professor Guido Martinotti </strong>(Milan),<strong> Naseem Khan, Professor Alain Tarrius </strong>(Toulouse)<strong> and 31 others</strong> <br><a href=\"mailto:judebloomfield@hotmail.com\">judebloomfield@hotmail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Think of the great all-rounders and it is cricketers who spring readily to mind. Unless you are one of those dotty, superannuated TV critics who campaign for the return of variety and cherish memories of the golden age of multi-tasking artistes such as Billy Dainty and Roy Castle, uppermost in your thoughts are likely to be Keith Miller, Sir Garfield Sobers and the rest of their illustrious breed.</p> <p>But there are footballers gifted enough not to be straitjacketed by position. These days they range from Steven Gerrard, one of the few who can play in defence, midfield and attack, to the more mundane attributes of big lads who flit between central defence and centre-forward without being wholly convincing at either. Like Gary \"the ginger Pele\" Doherty.</p> <p>Almost all of them seem to consider their versatility a curse, not a blessing, and pine for a role of their own. Their interviews may be peppered with platitudes such as \"I don't care where the gaffer plays me as long as I'm on the pitch\", but who among them seems genuinely thrilled \"to do a job\" for the side instead of doing their job for it?</p> <p>In most workplaces flexibility and adaptability are deemed integral to survival but in football too few players have the patience and ingenuity to step out of the comfort zone of their preferred position.</p> <p>Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo have roamed across all four attacking berths over the past couple of seasons but although each position has its own tactical demands, they are not what you would call genuine utility players who could be slotted seamlessly into most outfield positions without adversely affecting a team's strength.</p> <p>Juliano Belletti, however, seems more of a throwback, equally accomplished in the holding role, as an attacking midfielder and in his usual station at right-back. Yet he is not even Chelsea's first-choice utility man and he only got his break when Michael Essien was injured. Against Middlesbrough last week Belletti looked intelligent and dynamic enough to play off the centre-forward as well, no doubt helped by the sort of long-shooting prowess that allowed his compatriot Josimar to shine at the 1986 World Cup. I am sure he would play up front without complaint - content, as a true utilitarian, to devote himself to the \"greatest happiness of the greatest number\".</p> <p>Ten years ago, when Championship Manager was just a relatively straightforward computer game that consumed only your employer's time, rather than your entire life, three of the most valuable players were Ronald de Boer, Phillip Cocu and Luis Enrique. This was because they excelled in all outfield positions except centre-half. Since they played for Barcelona it was almost impossible to buy them, but, fortunately, a whimsical programmer had bestowed similar qualities on Chelsea's Bjarne Goldbaek, who could be bought for a song. You could stick him anywhere and he would become your team's talisman.</p> <p>As more of us become disillusioned with modern football, I have often thought that the companies behind those management simulation games could make a killing by bringing out retro versions. You could start in 1960, say, and do an Andrew Roberts by developing your own alternate histories. Top of the list of transfer targets would be John Charles, who was acclaimed by Nat Lofthouse as the best defender he had ever faced and by Billy Wright as the finest striker he had ever seen.</p> <p>Here was the epitome of a jack of all trades, yet someone who mastered each one. In team sports such diversification is a rare commodity. It is quite common in rugby league to see great players, such as Wally Lewis and Ellery Hanley, double up as loose forwards and stand-offs, but both positions demand the ability to dictate play. The \"infinite variety\" of Shakespeare's Cleopatra is not a prerequisite.</p> <p>The Gentle Giant's successor as Elland Road's Mr Versatile, Paul Madeley, had a broader range. In the club's 1972 Cup final song - written by Les Reed and Barry Mason, the composers of It's Not Unusual and Delilah for Tom Jones - Madeley is called \"the 11 Pauls\". It was a slight exaggeration - he never went in goal. But he did wear every shirt from No2 to No11 in a 700-game career. Quiet and elegant, on away trips his team-mates used to mock his habit of hanging his silk pyjamas in the wardrobe. But he will always be remembered for his calm industry and the self-effacement that even made him reject the England captaincy when it was offered by his mentor, Don Revie, in 1974.</p> <p>Variety was the spice of Paul Madeley's life, not its curse. What a pity so few have taken up his mantle.</p>",
  "<h2>Alain de Botton, philosopher</h2> <p>At 10.04pm last night I was thinking about how my sons (aged two and four) would feel about their childhoods in 20 years' time. I was thinking about what sort of things might go wrong in my relationship with them, because something always tends to, and yet I was still able to hope for the best. Between 5am and 6.30am and between 10pm and midnight are by far the most productive times for me - because there's no expectation. The best ideas invariably come after a lengthy period of concentrated thinking that has been a disaster. I give up, throw myself on a bed and decide to give up for ever. About 10 minutes later, a decent idea may then - on a good day - pop into my head.</p> <h2>Alex Kapranos, lead singer, Franz Ferdinand</h2> <p>I was sitting in Berlin at 10.04pm with an old friend I hadn't seen for a couple of years. She was filling me in on some gossip about a mutual friend and his love of wearing ladies' silk underwear. Nothing creative or intellectual, but I loved the story. Then I wrote our next album.</p> <h2>Shami Chakrabarti, director, Liberty</h2> <p>I was having a tortured and mundane conversation with my husband about what we're going to do over the Christmas holidays. So that's quite disappointing, although my BlackBerry does suggest that I was being very creative and active a few minutes earlier, sending emails about a new campaign, Common Values, we're working on - to explain the Human Rights Act to people who are hostile towards it. Just after 10pm is a good time for me. My son has gone to bed, I have had dinner and I think my best ideas come when I'm relaxed, so that will often be relatively late. Did we manage to sort out Christmas? No, the discussions continue. </p> <h2>Marc Quinn, artist</h2> <p>I was thinking about whether to have sushi or sashimi at a Japanese restaurant, but that was a creative decision: it affected how I felt for the rest of the evening. I went for sashimi. My most creative times of the day come at random; it can be waking up at 5am and lying there thinking, or in the middle of the day. I think it's about being open to having ideas at any time of the day. I get ideas from looking at things, or just lying down with my eyes closed and letting my mind wander.</p> <h2>Zandra Rhodes, fashion designer</h2> <p>I was packing up at the rehearsal of Aida - I have designed the sets and costumes for the opera at the Coliseum, which opens this week. I was going through last-minute thoughts. At that moment, I was double checking that the cloak looked OK on Amneris for the judgment scene. Normally at 10.04pm, I would be out at dinner. If you're among inspiring friends or you've just been to see a great play, I suppose you could have your most creative ideas at that time, but then you'd need to rush into work to do the practical side. But I'm a morning person - I don't often work into the night. </p> <h2>Sebastian Faulks, author</h2> <p>At 10.04pm on Monday I was thinking what I think at 10.04pm most nights: whether to open another bottle of wine. At that time of day I am usually either talking to people or watching the BBC News. It is a good time of day, but not a creative one. If ideas come, they tend to come when I'm asleep, or first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Mostly, though, they come when you hold a gun to their head and tell them to come, and that would be at the desk during the course of the working day. Between 11 and one, or five and seven, would probably be good places to start.</p> <h2>Roy Williams, playwright</h2> <p>I was on the tube, on my way home, thinking about the wonderful production of The Brothers Size I had seen at the Young Vic. Seeing good work always inspires me. There was a wonderful scene involving the use of the Otis Redding song, Try a Little Tenderness, that had me smiling and a clever device where the actors would speak the stage directions. I had decided then I was going to steal these ideas. All writers are thieves. </p> <p>I am a morning person. I love waking up with a solution to a script problem I had the night before. My most creative times are between 8am and 1pm. I work non-stop, but always begin the day with an hour of quality TV drama from one of my beloved box sets. </p> <h2>Sharon Horgan, comedian</h2> <p>I set my alarm so I could find out exactly what creative thoughts I was having at that special time, but I was surprised to find that I was thinking about the episode of Katie &amp; Peter: The Final Chapter I'd seen the night before. I was pretty disappointed by that because I was hoping for an idea for a film or a new invention or something. I usually hit my stride creatively at about 1.40pm. I panic when I realise I've been sitting at my laptop for three hours and done fuck-all. A lot of my work is done in a creative panic. I do sometimes think of solutions to difficult storylines or funny stuff when I'm lying in bed at night and I pop them into my BlackBerry, which I keep beside my bed. A bit like Madonna.</p> <h2>Edward Gardner, musical director, English National Opera</h2> <p>Last night I was sitting at my desk learning the score for Boris Godunov, which I will be conducting. Today is our first orchestral rehearsal and it opens in three weeks. I must have been concentrating very hard because I started at 9.30pm and the next time I looked at the clock it was 10.30pm, so for someone with quite a short attention span that's pretty good. It has got completely under my skin, I really love it. I like working in the evenings because it's such a peaceful time. If I'm conducting, I'll be on stage at 10.04pm, heading towards the end of the opera. If it's going well, you feel incredibly focused at that time. </p> <h2>Margaret Drabble, author</h2> <p>I am usually asleep by then, or in bed and not at my best. My best time is walking at five or six in the evening on a summer's day. I get nearly all my ideas walking in the early evening or late afternoon, but in bed, never.</p> <h2>Stephen Bayley, cultural commentator</h2> <p>I was making egg-fried rice. I'd love to tell you I was having the most amazing epiphany but it simply isn't true. I felt I couldn't sit around urging a creative moment just for the sake of it - I was wondering if I should use one egg or two. I do like doing things in the kitchen, I find it quite zen-like, but I usually get my best ideas in one of two places - either on an airplane where I'm so fidgety and restless it forces me to think about things and I always carry a notebook to scribble in, or when I go for a run. I usually go running in the evening - though never as late as 10pm - and I find it generally productive, maybe it's because of a lack of oxygen to the brain or something. </p> <h2>Philip Pullman, author</h2> <p>I was thinking about what I was watching on the TV news, which was the story about the Christian aid worker killed in Afghanistan - a perfect example of how religion inspires both good and evil, and evil wins. In general I work best in the morning. But that may be just the result of habit.</p> <h2>Edward Stourton, presenter, Today programme</h2> <p>Last night at that time I was thinking about finding my hire car in Toulouse airport car park. But usually I would be asleep. I go to bed at 8.30pm or 9pm because I have to get up at 3am to get to work on the Today programme. I have to say I am the least inspirational person at 10 o'clock. I think my most creative time is at 6am. It may be partly because my brain has adjusted to that time, because that's the minute we go on air. But even on days when I'm not recording, if I sit down at my desk between 6am and 7am, that's when I'm at my best. </p> <h2>Linda Grant, author</h2> <p>Just before 10pm last night I went to turn off my computer, and I found an email that required answering. It was from someone who wanted to know at what times I might be free in Toronto, where I will be next week. At 10.03pm I sent the email and turned the computer off. At 10.04pm, my thought was: \"Ah, I think I'll just listen to The World Tonight.\" I suppose 10.04pm can provide a eureka moment, but it depends what you're doing: sometimes you're already fast asleep, sometimes you're rat-arsed. For creative activity, the most productive times are when you're closest to sleep - either after you've just woken up, or when you're just settling down. That's when the mind relaxes.</p> <h2>Richard Eyre, film and theatre director</h2> <p>10.04pm is a very curious time. It certainly wouldn't be my peak time for ideas - not least because I usually eat late and have a few glasses of wine. If I'm working in the theatre the show has generally finished or is finishing around then. If I'm filming I'll be preparing for the next day so I might be hoping for a brilliant idea around 10.04pm but am probably too tired to think. I have my best ideas in bed on the edge of sleep: the difficulty is to remember them in the morning or to write them down at the time of having them, which drives away sleep. So not encouraged. The best time for me is early in the morning - around 8am. Then I'm fresh and optimistic and everything is possible.</p> <h2>Naomi Alderman, author</h2> <p>I was in my bedroom. I'd been chatting online to a friend about a gig I went to, swapping jokes. I suddenly got a bit restless. Maybe it's the flipping over from nine-something, which is clearly \"evening\" to 10-something: \"suitable for an early night\" that does it. I stretched, walked around the room, looked out of the window. I watched the people wandering past. I can't say I had a brilliant idea, but leaving the computer would have put me in a good place to get one; good ideas come up when you move between tasks. Perhaps 10pm, the time when we move from day to night, really could be especially good for ideas. I like the idea that there's a time for ideas every day. Maybe I'll get a great idea tomorrow. </p> <h2>Jenny Colgan, author</h2> <p>I was thinking about Pat Kavanagh [the literary agent who died on Monday], as I imagine were most of your writers. I usually just feel sleepy at that time and never work at night, but I do find my mind quite buzzy. Annoyingly, it comes out in a pointless - and embarrassing - way: I will start writing in my head an elaborate synopsis for whatever TV series I'm currently watching. I have pretty thorough episodes for the West Wing Season Two, The Wire Season Three and the Martha Jones series of Doctor Who. It's a terrible waste of creative energy; I have two pilots in development and two books on the go and should really be thinking about them. But it gets me to sleep.</p> <h2>Antony Beevor, historian</h2> <p>I am afraid that I did not take an alarm clock to dinner, so I cannot record precisely my thoughts at 10.04pm last night, but while we were chatting with friends, my brain was working in the background or on a subconscious level, tackling the problems I had with the final chapter of my book on D-Day and the Battle for Normandy. My wife had been through the chapter before we went out and made some very telling points about cuts and construction, and by the time we arrived home, I was clear on what needed to be done.</p> <h2>Michael Berkeley, composer</h2> <p>I was in the green room of the Wigmore Hall having just left the stage following a concert largely of my music, so, as is usually the case at that time of night, I was savouring the fruits of creativity rather than being creative. I tend to be a morning person and like to get down on to paper what may, or may not, be the machinations of the subconscious, post-sleep. 10.04pm is therefore more a time for thoughts of recreation, procreation - anything but the misleading confidence of (even slightly) alcohol-fuelled work that will probably have to be junked the next morning under the harsh rays of reality at 10.04am.</p> <h2>Ekow Eshun, artistic director, ICA</h2> <p>I had the news on TV and I was reading the new John Updike book, The Widows of Eastwick. I'm reviewing it on Newsnight Review, so I was trying to think about it. I was also thinking about conversation I'd had earlier that evening with Dennis Hopper, because he'd been giving a talk at the ICA - I remember thinking I was quite surprised how elastic his mind was, the way it flicks from art to film to photography. It's the kind of mind I'd like \u00b7 </p> <h2>Nick Clegg, leader, Liberal Democrats</h2> <p>I was coming back from a dinner with economic experts. I began to think about the danger of the environment being left behind as the economy worsens. High energy bills are an environmental problem as well as an economic one. We have to think creatively. Why is it that people are charged more for the initial amount of energy they use? Turning this tariff structure on its head would encourage people to use less energy and help the poorest who use less already. Now there's a simple idea all economists can surely agree on.</p> <h2>On the web</h2> <p>Were you creative last night at 10.04pm?<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/genetics-creativity\">theguardian.com/commentisfree</a></p>",
  "<p>As the new top man at Friends of the Earth, Andy Atkins is a man of his time. He previously worked for the Christian aid charity Tearfund, testament to the rising importance of development groups in the environment movement. Meanwhile, his dapper suit belies a long career \"in the field\" in some of the world's poorest countries, but hints at the journey many of the best-known green groups have made, from radical freedom fighters to green establishment.</p> <p>In this new world order, some have questioned what future there is for the old guard, caught between angry single-issue protest groups, such as Plane Stupid and the anti-coal campaign Leave It In The Ground, and the encroachment of green voices from other areas: third world charities, thinktanks, or business. </p> <p>The change of leadership and a new strategy in November are an opportunity to answer some of these questions.</p> <p>After years of shouting about the threat of climate change, one shift will be to pay far more attention to advocating solutions to the crisis. The other focus will be on putting biodiversity back on an equal footing with headline-hogging greenhouse gases, reminding the world of the mass extinction under way.</p> <p>In his first full interview since his appointment, Atkins says: \"In five years' time, we'd like everybody to be talking about the vulnerability of the natural world to people, and the value of the services the natural world provides - water, soil, clean air.\"</p> <p>Atkins grew up with his Anglican minister parents in Australia, for a while on the edge of tropical forest in Queensland, but much of the time on the Torres Strait Islands archipelago. \"I grew up surrounded by extraordinary beauty and a sustainable lifestyle: people fished, grew their own crops, etc, but also my parents were deeply involved in what would now be called social justice issues. You can feel the intimate link between natural resources and wellbeing.\"</p> <p>Atkins, married with three children, began working in human rights - first for the Chile Committee for Human Rights, later for Cafod (now the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development), the Catholic Institute of International Relations (now Progressio), then Tearfund. At Tearfund, his first campaign was to stop a hydroelectric dam that was threatening rainforest in Honduras and the people living in it. He was later a founder of the Make Poverty History campaign, and led Tearfund's pioneering work on environment issues, especially climate change. </p> <p>His faith-based background has raised eyebrows, especially after recent debates between religious ideas about intelligent design and the more widely accepted theory of evolution. \"First, Friends of the Earth is avowedly secular, but welcomes people of all faiths and none,\" Atkins says. Second, he has \"a lot of sympathy\" with the 18th-century naturalist John Ray: \"He described science as a way of better understanding God's creation. I don't find anything contradictory about the way science tells us the way the world works and the belief that God created it. I read traditional stories of the creation as clearly allegorical.\"</p> <p>On the priority issue of climate change, Atkins says: \"The argument on the science has been won by us and others. However, we have yet to see the argument over action that's needed. It requires a compete shift in thinking by governments. They need to move very fast and very hard.</p> <p>\"I'm still getting my head around the detail of FoE policy, but my understanding is that the nuclear debate is a total red herring because we can't get emissions down fast enough relying on nuclear.\" Geo-engineering solutions, such as carbon scrubbers, are too fraught with unknown consequences, he says, but carbon capture fares better. \"If that could work better long term, that could be an option, but the jury is still out, so let's not rely on that.\" </p> <h2>Aggressive mix</h2> <p>Instead, FoE advocates a safe but widely supported mix of aggressive energy efficiency improvements alongside renewable power technologies such as wave, tidal, solar and biomass. More controversially, Atkins says: \"Regulations, carbon pricing, policy solutions, incentivising people to do the right thing - we don't exclude any tool.\" </p> <p>However, he believes that nature should be protected for its own sake, not just as a human resource. \"To me, it's both: it has an intrinsic value, but it's also massively important to people.\" </p> <p>Again, the \"how\" arises. For biodiversity, it is a broader question, but Atkins picks on the controversial topic of meat: livestock needs to be reared more sustainably, and rich nations need to eat less meat, he says. \"People don't like being told what to do,\" he admits. \"But if they get there by their own conclusion, they are more likely to do it. \"</p> <p>For campaigners, the multibillion-dollar question is the next \"how\" - how to make politicians, businesses and voters/consumers/workers make the changes necessary to drastically reduce pressure on the natural world.</p> <p>\"You could argue about where it starts - people taking action or government taking action,\" Atkins says. \"You need both. Friends of the Earth is putting its weight behind government taking the right action that then makes it easier for people to do the right thing. But it's also well worthwhile people doing the right thing, as they can then say, 'We're doing the right thing, why don't you?'\" </p> <p>Atkins predicts that this will get easier as people increasingly realise that policies that reduce consumption of natural resources help them in other ways: tackling fuel poverty, or making the streets safer for cyclists, for example. \"I'm imagining a world with much less traffic ... where houses are much more energy efficient and have probably got renewable energy.

  "<p>When Simon Gunton began putting together a tribute to Syd Barrett, the enigmatic musician and original member of Pink Floyd who died in 2006, he says he could \"never have imagined\" the effect it would have on the mental health service users he was working with. \"They really seemed to identify with Syd,\" he says. \"There was a connection, especially among the musicians. The story of Syd's music, the fact that he was so creative and experimental, that he never did the same thing twice, it really resonated.\"</p> <p>Gunton, a professional session musician, runs music workshops with a range of vulnerable people, including ex-offenders, for the arts education charity Escape Artists. He says the evolution of The City Wakes project, a multimedia tribute to Barrett's life and music, has been an \"unusually inspirational\" experience. \"All kinds of people who knew and worked with Syd have become involved,\" he explains. \"We have loads of young volunteers, too. And Rosemary, Syd's sister, has been there right from the start, giving valuable time, money and energy to it.\"</p> <p>Barrett's career with Pink Floyd was short - difficulties associated with his use of drugs such as LSD have been blamed for his premature departure from the band and subsequent retreat from the music industry - but he is still widely regarded as the defining force in the band's influence on the 1960s psychedelic movement. Gunton says that by taking Barrett's music, exploring different arrangements and working toward a performance, musicians whose talent has been badly affected by their illnesses have been reinvigorated.</p> <p>\"One musician hadn't played for 13 years because of his illness, and now he's working on arrangements with me,\" Gunton says. \"Its amazing. And there's another guy who for a year, every time he picked up his guitar, felt sick. Now he's playing again. Syd's influence is enormous, especially on musicians from Cambridge, where he grew up and lived.\"</p> <p>Nicola Legget, a mental health service user and keen singer, who has been dealing with psychosis since the age of 12, says the Escape Artists workshops have changed her life. \"When you're very ill its hard not to become isolated and live on the outside of society,\" she says. \"I've been very much involved in The City Wakes. I write a lot of the melodies for the revamped Syd Barrett songs. It's one of the best projects I've been involved in.\"</p> <p>The tribute, which starts in Cambridge on October 22, before moving to London, mushroomed as more people came on board, Gunton says, and will now incorporate much more than musical performance. There will be an exhibition of Storm Thorgerson photographs, entitled Mind Over Matter: Images of Pink Floyd, a new book of interviews and memorabilia, special guided tours of Barrett-connected sites in Cambridge, and even a recreation of a 1960s-style \"happening\" directed and hosted by some of Barrett's former friends.</p> <p>As well as the workshops, Gunton will direct the musical production, which will showcase video art and \"Floyd-esque\" lighting displays, as well as reworkings of some of Barrett's most well-known pieces of music.</p> <p>For Rosemary Breen, Barrett's sister, the tribute is an opportunity to work with and help people in the local community, as well as remember her brother. \"The prospect of The City Wakes really excites me,\" she says. \"I'm looking forward to all of his old friends getting together, having a good laugh and a lot of fun while raising money for the mental health charity Escape Artists. There's so much going on and it will be great that Syd will be in the background of it all.\"</p> <p>Gunton says Escape Artists flourishes because it emphasises the vital role artistic expression can play in the lives of vulnerable people. \"I like to think of it as therapy through music,\" he says. \"I can't tell you how inspiring it has been. I was never even a Pink Floyd fan, but working with people in the workshop and seeing how they relate to Syd's music has given me a whole new understanding of it. It's worked for everyone involved.\"</p> <p>\u2022 More details at <a href=\"http://www.escapeartists.co.uk\">escapeartists.co.uk</a><br>See a preview of The City Wakes music group at <a href=\"http://www.thecitywakes.org.uk\">thecitywakes.org.uk</a></p>",

  "<h2>The carbon cash-in</h2> <p>Fresh from the devastation they have wrought on the global financial system, some of the world's leading investment banks meet in London today to discuss how they can \"cash in\" on carbon. But at least delegates and speakers at the Cashing in on Carbon conference are open about not trying to reduce emissions or helping the environment. Oh, no. This event is to see how \"investment banks can profit today from an increasingly diverse range of carbon-related investment opportunities\". Particularly reassuring is the emphasis on \"hybrid and complex carbon credit structured products\", and how to identify investor demand for them in the US; \"derivative/synthetic carbon products\"; and \"sub-index arbitrage strategies\".

  "<p>They are possibly the most despised financiers in America. But the nation's mortgage bankers, widely blamed for playing a central role in the global financial meltdown, are in no mood to be humble.</p> <p>Thumping rock music, a glittering lilac backdrop and vast US flags decorated the stage at this week's annual convention of the Mortgage Bankers Association. The comedian Jay Leno and the former presidential adviser Karl Rove were on hand to lift the battered industry's spirits.</p> <p>\"We're all still here and we're still standing,\" declared Kieran Quinn, outgoing chairman of the association, who took the floor to a pounding chorus of Coldplay's Viva la Vida. He arrived shortly after a colour guard in full military regalia hoisted a US flag while an opera singer belted out The Star Spangled Banner.</p> <p>A sea of grey suits, the thousand or so bankers at San Francisco's Moscone conference centre inhabit ground zero in the global economic crisis. President Bush, treasury secretary Henry Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, have all cited lax standards by mortgage lenders as a main reason for the financial paralysis that has spread from Wall Street to Europe and beyond.</p> <p>Billions of dollars worth of sub-prime mortgages were written at the height of America's property boom. These loans, never realistic, are deeply in default, leaving Wall Street with vast liabilities. More than two million Americans have lost their properties to repossession.</p> <p>\"Everybody believed that house prices would just keep rising,\" Quinn told his members. \"We, and everyone else, had unprecedented confidence that it was a golden age of finance. We thought we had solved everything - no more recessions, no more inflation.\"</p> <p>In a normal year, nobody would take much notice of a gathering of home-loan providers. But a noisy group of protesters were on hand to remind them of their unpopularity. Campaigners outside the conference wielded placards reading \"Grand theft bail-out\" and \"Jail greedy bankers - let them rot\".</p> <p>Despite tight security, several protesters made it into the hall. One leapt on to the stage and tried to handcuff Rove, accusing him of treason. The campaigner was dragged away, yelling: \"Karl Rove is not fit to address you!\" </p> <p>Rove pleased the assembled financiers by asserting that Democrats in Congress were to blame for the crisis by refusing to regulate the mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \"The 'let them do anything they want' crowd were all Democrats,\" he said. </p> <p>One mortgage banker was moved to yell: \"We love you Karl, you're great!\" </p> <p>Bill Hackwell of Answer, a protest coalition involved in the demonstration, said: \"We wanted to make sure they didn't think it was going to be business as usual as they meet to work out how to cover themselves.\"</p> <p>The MBA's own figures show that 9.1% of mortgages on US family homes are in arrears, the highest figure since records started 39 years ago. Among delegates, though, the mood was philosophical. Groups of mortgage bankers stood around, swapping stories and exchanging business cards. Some were willing to admit that their industry had made mistakes, but they argued that customers, regulators, the government and Wall Street were all also at fault.</p> <p>Jim Kunzler, president of an Indiana lender, 1st Source Bank, blamed \"investor greed, some bad acting in the lending community and many uninformed borrowers\" for the financial crisis. \"To say one industry is responsible for all this is a little simplistic,\" he said.</p> <p>His view was echoed by Ted Eric May, partner at law firm Sheldon May, which specialises in servicing the mortgage industry: \"All of us are to blame. Our society has gone from living within our means to borrowing without restraint.\"</p> <p>Yet inside the hall, specialists spoke of a reckless culture in which lenders failed to make basic checks on borrowers' incomes. Phillip McCall, a mortgage fraud investigator, cited the case of a warehouse worker who applied for a mortgage, claiming an income of $7,500 (\u00a34,500) per month: \"Common sense tells you someone in a warehouse is not going to be earning $90,000.\" McCall said his firm has seen its workload leap from four or five mortgage investigations a month to several thousand.</p> <p>As delegates drifted out of the hall clutching complimentary Freddie Mac document bags, there was a general sense of defiance. Sipping a drink as a guitarist played in the foyer, Cary Burch, chief executive of a mortgage software provider, LSSI, said mortgage lending was a force for good: \"I'm proud to be part of this industry. It's been great to help people achieve their home ownership dreams.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you scrutinise Mervyn King's speech last night, it is still possible to find the governor of the Bank of England fretting about inflationary dangers. Prospects for oil and other commodity prices are \"difficult to assess\"; the credit crunch will affect not only demand but also the supply potential of the economy.</p> <p>But take a step back from these nuanced points and consider the straightforward stuff. The UK economy is entering a recession, said King, and \"during the past month, the balance of risks to inflation in the medium term shifted decisively to the downside\".</p> <p>The word \"decisively\" is the one to focus on. If the risks have shifted to that degree, this month's half-point cut in interest rates is unlikely to be the last. Even before last night, the money markets were pricing in the probability of a similar cut next month, taking the base rate down to 4%. </p> <p>Yesterday's probability now looks a near-certainty.</p> <p>That idea is also encouraged by King's view that \"the age of innocence\" - when banks would lend to each other on an unsecured basis for only a small premium over base rate - may never return. </p> <p>\"We now face a long, slow haul to restore lending to the real economy, and hence growth of our economy, to more normal conditions,\" said the governor.</p> <p>He was making a broader point, but markets may well interpret the comment as further support for the idea that interest rates could go well below 4%. Why? Well, one way to encourage money to flow around the system is to make its price cheaper. King, the man accused of being overly concerned about \"moral hazard\", suddenly sounds like an arch-pragmatist.<br><strong><br>Overburdened</strong></p> <p>Rob Templeman, the chief executive of Debenhams, has been talking about his \"deleveraging initiatives\" - paying back debt, in normal speech - for months. Yesterday he unveiled his latest idea. He cut the final dividend from 3.8p per share to 0.5p to save \u00a328m.</p> <p>This is what happens when a reasonably healthy retailer, producing operating profit of \u00a3176m, tries to carry an unhealthy amount of debt, roughly \u00a31bn in the case of Debenhams. </p> <p>Some 42% of last year's operating profit was consumed by interest payments, a frightening ratio going into a recession.</p> <p>But Templeman seems to have forgotten how Debenhams placed this millstone around its neck. It was because a private equity crew - of which he was a member - did very well for itself by buying the company, selling its freehold properties and then returning the business to the stock market with a barrel-load of debt.</p> <p>Templeman prefers to brush over this fact. The way he tells it, stock market fashion is somehow to blame. \"Previously the market liked the amount of debt we had taken on,\" he said yesterday. \"The market, however, has now changed its mind on debt.\"</p> <p>Come on, Mr Templeman, this won't do. You made a decision about the appropriate capital structure and you were too ambitious.</p> <p>Nor it is clear that your \"deleveraging initiatives\" are radical enough. </p> <p>Saving \u00a330m on dividends, cutting \u00a340m from capital expenditure, squeezing costs and working capital may sound dramatic, but last year's belt-tightening exercises knocked a mere \u00a322m off borrowings. Even on a starvation diet, Debenhams is likely to find itself in 2011-2012 trying to refinance \u00a3700m-\u00a3800m of debt. </p> <p>And that's if everything goes well.<br><strong><br>Prudent indeed</strong></p> <p>Prudential's shareholders can breathe again. There were no nasties in yesterday's figures and the capital surplus of \u00a31.2bn comfortably met expectations. Talk of an imminent rights issue to shore up the balance sheet can be dismissed; the corporate bond market would have to weaken considerably before the Pru was forced to tap shareholders.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the operations in Asia, with the exception of Taiwan, continue to deliver strong flows of new business. The UK business is even perking up. Better, chief executive Mark Tucker is in control of his senses: he is looking at opportunities presented by the implosion of AIG, his chief rival in Asia, but knows that funding a multibillion-pound acquisition would be tricky when the Pru's shares are trading around 350p, rather than the 500p seen in the summer. Realism reigns.</p> <p>As long as that remains so, the Pru looks a decent bet at today's level. A purchase of bits of AIG at a knock-down price could clearly make sense, given the scope for cost savings. But it would be worrying if sovereign wealth funds were ushered in to fund a deal that existing shareholders would regard as too adventurous. Tucker, thankfully, seems to accept the point. Despite the past week's excitements, the script at the Pru looks reassuringly dull. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Yes</strong></p> <p><strong>James Churchill</strong><br>Association for Real Change</p> <p>There can be no doubting the commitment of this government to the \"personalisation\" agenda in adult social care, but some of the possible implications are only now beginning to emerge. The area where the long-term impact will be greatest is the social care workforce.</p> <p>There is concern that recent improvements in the training, qualifications and professional standing of social care staff will be lost. Recent research by Skills for Care, the sector's skills and training agency, encapsulates the problem neatly. Only 7% of people surveyed who used direct payments to employ personal assistants (PAs) had paid for, or arranged for, their staff to be trained. The most common reason for PAs leaving jobs was poor prospects for personal development, partly because employers did not think it their role to offer further training and partly because they could not afford it.</p> <p>The cumulative impact could be considerable if, as the government intends, personalisation extends to all aspects of social care services. Local authorities have a critical role to play here. Decisions about the hourly rates payable via direct payments or personal budgets will, to a large extent, determine how service users can recruit and support staff. Normally, anything less than \u00a311 an hour will preclude using an external employer, or agency, because it would not cover overheads such as sickness, holidays, training, paternity/maternity cover, employers' national insurance, pension, management costs, recruitment, administration, registration, insurance and VAT (which increases next April). Travel costs may be a critical additional cost where the worker supports more than one person, since local authorities usually pay only for \"contact time\".</p> <p>An informal discussion among members of the Association for Real Change revealed that authorities are providing for hourly rates ranging from \u00a39.50 to \u00a322 an hour for direct support staff. Anecdotal evidence is that rates are being driven down to the point where the only realistic solution for service users is to become direct employers. Many service-user organisations will welcome this, but only as matter of choice - not out of financial necessity to maintain levels of support.</p> <p>Personalisation might undermine the professionalisation of social care staff. If PAs do become the dominant staff group in the care sector, we can expect problems over lack of pay, status and career pathways and for the perception to take hold that \"anyone can do this job\". The long-term deskilling of the workforce will have consequences far beyond the narrow view of individual employer/PA relationships. Who will pay for a worker to develop expertise which the service-user employer may not need? Unless access to funds for training is changed, freedom of choice for many may ultimately limit the choices of those who need specific skills in their support staff.</p> <p>Personalisation is not the enemy of professionalism but, for mainly economic reasons, it risks becoming so. For the wider benefit of the sector, we urgently need to think these things through.</p> <p>\u2022 James Churchill is chief executive of the Association for Real Change. This is a personal view</p> <p><strong>No</strong></p> <p><strong>Ken Stapleton</strong><br>Oldham social services</p> <p>The radical change demanded by the personalisation agenda is raising legitimate concerns, including the possible demise of social work and care management, reduced demand for trained workers and the lowering of skills all round. The implied charge is that people who use services will receive lesser-quality care.</p> <p>What should be the response of those of us who have witnessed the significant difference that new ways of working have made to the quality of people's lives - and, in some cases, deaths?</p> <p>The transfer of power and resources to service users to self-assess and commission their own support may spell the end of care management as a process, but I believe it has the potential to reinvigorate social work and social care. As a social work team manager, I was berated constantly about the bureaucratic nature of care management; now, the challenge of personalisation is to focus upon real quality-of-life issues - not on what the person cannot do or on a narrow list of services. This has the potential for the profession to reclaim some of the work that has passed to third parties over the past 15 years.</p> <p>With the emergence of new, smaller providers, including self-employed personal assistants (PAs), there is no reason why current standards of training and professional development should not be preserved. Local authorities currently offer training to both state and private providers in areas such as safeguarding policies, risk management, moving and handling, confidentiality and metal health. In many cases, this is offered without charge. Some private agencies invest in induction, NVQ and other forms of training and occasionally staff choose to purchase development opportunities for themselves, including social work training, counselling courses, Open University modules and degrees. All this can continue.</p> <p>New roles have the potential to attract new entrants to the social care sector. There are already numerous examples of people who, having previously had no formal training, now provide an excellent service to personal budget users. On-the-job training is delivered by user/employers themselves and they, after all, are likely to be the best guides in determining how, when and where they wish to be supported. Staff trained in this way are more likely to be receptive, understanding and creative.</p> <p>The local authority continues to retain the duty of care to all of its citizens who are eligible to receive a service and clear guidance can be issued to all user/employers on the nuts and bolts of being a good employer. All employers, big and small, retain the duties and responsibility to all employees enshrined in legislation, procedure and guidance.</p> <p>We need to be proactive in this time of change so that overly risk-averse solutions do not constrain the right of people to make their own decisions about support to get the life they want. It is well known that to achieve significant cultural or organisational change, a \"can-do\" attitude is critical. Making a success of personalised care for users also creates real opportunities for care workers.</p> <p>\u2022 Ken Stapleton was until recently team manager, self-directed support, for Oldham social services</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for corruption yesterday as prosecutors in Bangkok pushed to have him extradited from Britain.</p> <p>Thaksin, the first Thai prime minister to be convicted of corruption committed while in office, was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife to buy land from a state agency at a reduced price. </p> <p>Thaksin, who was forced out in a bloodless coup in 2006, has been accused of a number of corruption offences that he maintains are politically motivated. </p> <p>The supreme court convicted Thaksin, 59, by a majority of five to four but cleared him of more serious charges of abuse of power to obtain the land. </p> <p>The case centred on a 5.3 hectare (13 -acre) plot of land that Thaksin's wife Pojaman bought from a state financial institution for \u00a312.9m, a third of its estimated value, two years after Thaksin became prime minister in 2001. The panel ruled seven to two to acquit Pojaman, 51, of all the charges in connection with the land purchase, though she was sentenced to three years' jail in July for tax evasion in a separate case.</p> <p>Thaksin dismissed the case as part of a plot against him. \"I'm a politician and after I was toppled by the coup it's normal that they will try every means to justify it,\" he said. \"They don't use the rule of the law as evidence, they follow the politics.\"</p> <p>Prosecutors said they would file a formal extradition request with the UK to bring Thaksin back to Thailand to serve his sentence and face other charges.</p> <p>The billionaire, who fled to London after the coup, bought Manchester City football club.

  "<p>The long-running legal battle between the British government and the Chagos islanders over their eviction from their homes in the Indian Ocean nearly 40 years ago will reach its conclusion in the House of Lords this morning. </p> <p>The law lords will deliver their ruling on whether the surviving islanders have the right to return, after being removed from the archipelago to make way for the US base on Diego Garcia.</p> <p>Nine Chagossians flew in from their current homes in Mauritius yesterday, joining exiles who have settled in Crawley to hear the judgment of Lords Bingham, Hoffman, Rodger, Carswell and Mance.</p> <p>Today's ruling is the last stage of a lengthy legal battle launched in the name of Olivier Bancoult, one of the evicted islanders, in 1998. </p> <p>Both the divisional court and the court of appeal have ruled in favour of the Chagossians' right to return to the outer islands, which do not include Diego Garcia, but the Foreign Office appealed against those judgments in the Lords. \"We remain hopeful that once and for all there will be a conclusion that will see justice for the Chagossian people,\" said Bashir Khan of the Chagos Refugees Group UK. </p> <p>Britain took the Chagos islands from France in the Napoleonic wars and, under a 1971 immigration ordinance, removed the inhabitants compulsorily so that the main island in the archipelago, Diego Garcia, could be used as a US base. After the evictions, which took place over a number of years, the islanders were exiled to Mauritius and Seychelles, more than 1,000 miles from their homes, where many slipped into poverty and drug and alcohol addiction. While only a small number say they would return to the islands to live, they have argued that all Chagossians should be granted the right to return.</p> <p>The law lords were told in the hearing in July that Diego Garcia had been regarded by the US since 9/11 as \"a linchpin for the UK's allies\". The US has claimed that even allowing the Chagossians to return to other islands presents a security risk.</p> <p>The Foreign Office argued in the hearing that allowing the Chagossians to return would be \"precarious and costly\".</p>",
  "<h2>Emotional education</h2> <p>I fully support Mark Johnson's call for emotional education and support for young people (Inside out, October 15), but if it is to succeed, this emotional education needs to begin further up the line. How can a teacher understand and help a child or teenager in difficulty or emotional distress if they don't have at least some understanding of who they are and how they tick? </p> <p>Too many of my own teachers wreaked havoc and made things much worse in classrooms by blaming the kid kicking off in the back for the teacher's own inability to manage their anger and fear. Personal accountability and self-awareness are key to any individual's growth and maturity. Personal emotional development needs to be a key part of any teacher-training package.</p> <p>The sooner the government understands the importance and urgency of this and implements it as part of all teacher training initiatives, the better for the whole of society. <br><strong>Caspar Walsh</strong>, author, teacher and personal development worker</p> <h2>Keeping the bird balance</h2> <p>I am appalled that in these enlightened times some people still think it is sport to kill other living creatures (Foul deeds or fair prey? October 15). They also think it is acceptable to kill protected birds, such as buzzards, that only kill to survive.</p> <p>As an RSPB member, I read about the numbers of birds of prey that are shot, poisoned or trapped because someone wants to protect the birds that they have raised for someone else to shoot. It is a situation almost beyond belief - until one realises that big money is involved in this. Please can we move away from this myth that gamekeepers help to preserve wildlife and the countryside? <br><strong>Victoria Nicholls</strong>, Deal, Kent</p> <p>\u2022 The only people I have ever met who are interested in killing raptors are wealthy landowners who enjoy shooting for sport. This is a very small, atypical minority of rural dwellers. There is a wide social and class divide between those enthusiasts and the rural majority.</p> <p>The relationship of raptors to prey is very direct. When the prey species is plentiful, the raptors flourish; when the prey species is scarce, the raptors perish. The waxing and waning of prey and raptor secures a balanced population over time, but the huntin', shootin' and fishin' set try to counter that balance by introducing and protecting more prey while trying to exterminate the raptors.</p> <p>It is yet another instance of man trying to control nature. However, in this case it is not for the general benefit of humanity, but for the savage pleasure of a very few.<br><strong>Ron Carthy</strong>, by email</p> <h2>The resilience of localism</h2> <p>The views of your contributors on the likely fallout from the current financial turmoil for public services (When money's too tight, October 15) certainly echo what our members are telling us. However, they fail to take account of the crucial perspectives of people living in areas of high deprivation, whose quality of life depends on services working well. </p> <p>Bassac member organisations are at the heart of their neighbourhoods. The people they encounter feel utterly disconnected from the global culture of boom and bust and cannot benefit in the same way as others who are economically mobile. Instead, they look to small-scale initiatives that respond directly to their needs and make their communities more resilient.</p> <p>We think locally owned solutions, supported by independent organisations anchored in the community, put local people in control of local issues and services.

  "<p>The \"professionalisation\" of the voluntary sector continues apace, with children's charity NSPCC appointing a former media business high-flyer as its new chief executive.</p> <p>Andrew Flanagan, who takes over from Mary Marsh in January, was chief executive of Scotland's biggest media firm, STV (previously SMG), for 10 years until he resigned in 2006. </p> <p>He brings serious media pedigree. While at SMG, Flanagan oversaw the company's acquisition of Virgin Radio and DJ Chris Evans's firm, Ginger Productions, as well as adding stakes in independent radio to the SMG portfolio. He left SMG in the wake of shareholder pressure and subsequently took up the post of chair at Heritage House, a private publishing investment company. He has also worked for PA Consulting, the IT and telecoms company Nynex, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p>Flanagan's progress will be watched carefully in the light of questions raised in recent years about the charity's strategy. Last year, a report from New Philanthropy Capital argued there was no evidence that the charity's Full Stop campaign, aimed at raising public awareness of child abuse, and which raised around \u00a3250m in donations, would make any real dent in child cruelty statistics. Its television adverts have also been criticised for allegedly stoking public fears about the risks posed to children.</p> <p>Joe Saxton, of third sector consultancy nfpSynergy, says the media is not \"a typical corporate background\" that charities traditionally look to for top executives. It will be a matter of \"watch this space\", Saxton says. \"He will need to spend about six months just talking to people in the charity to find out how the organisation might need to change.\" </p> <p>One issue he will have to address, Saxton says, is NSPCC's dominance of the children's charity fundraising market at the expense of smaller rivals - a phenomenon dubbed by Conservative MP and social justice guru Iain Duncan Smith as the \"Tesco-isation\" of the third sector. Last year, NSPCC's income was \u00a3152m, of which \u00a3116m came from voluntary donations.</p> <p>A spokesman for the NSPCC says that while Flanagan has no track record in the voluntary sector, his \"experience of leading large-scale organisations through growth and change\" will be a valuable addition to the organisation.</p>",

  "<p>As the old ideological certainties disintegrate and Britain faces recession and rising unemployment, changing the way we approach welfare is imperative.</p> <p>This government is the first to dare to address the way the benefits system works, but despite some significant shifts due to be announced next week, the fundamental system remains outmoded. It is still constructed as an on-off switch, rather than as ladders or bridges to a different life. It mirrors an old-fashioned nine-to-five world that has been disappearing for decades, and it is incapable of responding to the realities of sessional, seasonal, part-time, short-term work. Based on Victorian ideas of making welfare as awful as possible, it is bureaucratic and confusing. Compliance falls heavily on vulnerable individuals and wastes lives. The multi-billion-pound welfare cheque keeps people stuck just above the gutter.</p> <p>Meanwhile, local regeneration has to work with a benefits system that defeats it. Engaging people in improving their communities is crucial to reviving neighbourhoods. But when people in these neighbourhoods are offered opportunities for local sessional work, their housing officers often say: \"Oh, you don't want to do that.\" The risk to benefits status - not just the clawback in a particular week, but the fear of disruption, and the impact on secondary benefits such as free prescriptions, free school meals and, most important, housing benefit - is an unacceptable burden, so people just walk away.</p> <p>The work that needs doing in local communities doesn't get done, even though the human resource, the wages, and the organisations to manage it are all there on the doorstep, hamstrung by the system. As the traditional labour market shrinks, the bottom rung of the ladder retracts, and the long-term social and economic costs rocket.</p> <p>What if carefully chosen community-based organisations could pay people to do work that strengthens their neighbourhoods and increases their skills and confidence, without losing their benefits status? The community allowance proposal, developed by the Create Consortium, argues for exactly that. Focusing on the overlap between welfare reform and local regeneration, it offers a timely solution to the problems of both.</p> <p>The two main political parties are talking of introducing community \"boot camps\" - full-time, mandatory community work by people who have been on benefits for two years or more. This is the wrong approach. Community work is a great opportunity . . . part of the carrot, not one of the sticks. Recent Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) research is damning of workfare in the US and Australia; it doesn't work. Policy writers admit they don't understand what \"chaotic lives\" might mean, and the lack of a user voice in benefits policy is excruciating.</p> <p>Through time-limited, flexible, supportive schemes, devised locally within a national agreement, the community allowance would create bridges to independence. It would engage a far wider range of community and public organisations with the \"worklessness agenda\" than could ever be involved through the DWP's brutal commissioning regime. It would unleash a new economy of the work that should be done but isn't getting done - real work that ground-level community organisations identify and pay for through existing funding streams.</p> <p>These are new times, and we need to rethink what the benefits system is for. We need community allowance pilots throughout the UK, with rigorous evaluation. The Department for Communities and Local Government committed to this in its Communities in Control white paper this summer, and the DWP has extensive piloting powers. The welfare secretary, James Purnell, just needs to say yes.</p>",
  "<p>Two recent productions have raised the bar for Sophoclean interpretations, each exemplifying the radically different approaches you can take to the dramatist. Lucy Pitman-Wallace's Nottingham Playhouse production of The Burial at Thebes (Seamus Heaney's version of the Antigone legend) was an austere, choric spectacle. Jonathan Kent's urgent, modern-dress Oedipus at the National Theatre, meanwhile, treats attic tragedy as a branch of current affairs.</p> <p>A credit in the programme for Greg Hersov's new production acknowledging Greater Manchester Police for the loan of riot shields makes clear the way things will be heading here. Though the physical location is never identified, its parched and cracked appearance looks conspicuously like the aftermath of a desert storm. Under these conditions, Antigone's crime of performing an illicit burial might be seen less as a seditious challenge to the authority of the state than a criminal misuse of dust.</p> <p>The chief benefit of Hersov's approach is its easy accessibility. Creon is portrayed as a consummate modern politician who strides in shaking hands with the audience. And, though Andrew Sheridan's bug-eyed messenger perhaps delivers more laughs than Sophocles intended, Hersov realises that Greek tragedy is never unreservedly tragic.</p> <p>That said, there are aspects of Don Taylor's chatty, colloquial translation that strike one as a little bathetic. The image of Antigone \"stubbing her toe against the marble steps of law\" sounds like a minor mishap rather than a bruising encounter with inviolable fate; while the description of hell as Persephone's hotel sounds like it has been lifted from the Rough Guide to the Underworld.</p> <p>Matti Houghton uses such informality to her advantage, however, conceiving the heroine as a vulnerable, highly engaging personality. In many cases Antigone's commitment to her cause, admirable though it may be, can seem a little priggish. Houghton, however, gives the impression of an orphaned child whose actions are motivated less by an obsession with martyrdom than a comforting belief in the prospect of rejoining her family on the other side.</p> <p>It befalls Ian Redford's Creon to formulate a rational response to an opponent who does not behave rationally. Far from being an unyielding tyrant, Redford seems remarkably reasonable, though his reference to \"special techniques\" of interrogation indicates otherwise. But it is precisely this paranoid ability to perceive the enemy everywhere that makes Sophocles seem so unerringly modern.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago, I took an enormous leap of faith. I jumped from 10 years of long-term incapacity benefit and back into work. I've had ME (myalgic encephalopathy, or chronic fatigue syndrome) and I couldn't have coped without the benefit during my illness. But I learned that while getting the benefit in the first place is a nightmare, getting off it is almost as difficult.</p> <p>The government hasn't made it easy for incapacity benefit (IB) claimants to get back to work. Current moves to overhaul the entire system and siphon claimants into the new employment and support allowance (ESA), with the added threat of benefit cuts if they fail to comply, don't fill me with much confidence. </p> <p>The consultation phase for the welfare reform green paper, No one Written Off, closes today, and next Monday the first changes take effect. IB has been a rigid, all-or-nothing system; you can work, or you can't. It takes no notice of the many chronic and fluctuating conditions that keep people out of full-time employment, but which might allow them to work intermittently. Unfortunately, many Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) doctors - employed through private contractors - are still woefully inexpert at dealing with complex, unseen illnesses such as ME.</p> <p>From October 27, a two-tier benefits system will operate. New ESA claimants will be divided into those who can do some work and a minority deemed unable to do any. The latter \"support\" group will receive a higher rate of benefit. The government aims to cut the numbers of claimants by 20,000 per year by applying more stringent criteria to the new work capability assessments. Given that these assessments are conducted without an independent disability adviser present, there is a real danger that people will get shunted into the wrong pen from the word \"Go\", and left there.</p> <p>I remember my first medical. I sat in a soulless waiting room, having only just managed to get there by taxi. The benefits doctor I was finally admitted to see sat in a neat suit and listened with a completely blank expression on his face. He asked a few questions, ticked a few boxes, and declared: \"You don't look ill.\" The stress of this encounter was enormous and I was close to tears. I'd been forced to leave a successful job in publishing. \"Do you think I'm doing this for the laughs?\" I wanted to ask.</p> <p>The DWP appears to have some difficulty understanding sickness, as opposed to disability. If you roll up in a wheelchair or, better still, are carried in on a stretcher, they'll probably pass you, but if you can just about get through a 10-minute medical you'll have a hard time convincing them you're unfit for full-time work.</p> <p>Despite this, I was relieved to discover I had passed - possibly because I can express myself reasonably well. But what of others who can't, or who simply don't understand how the whole complicated benefits system grinds inexpertly along?</p> <p>My own problems began when I first developed flu-like symptoms on holiday. After a month of feeling constantly lousy, I decided to return home, thinking I had a virus of some kind. It felt like it. I could barely move. No one knew much about ME then, and, crucially, I wasn't told to rest in the early stages. I ploughed on, returning to work too soon.</p> <p>Over the next few years, I was dogged by the same strange viral feeling that eroded my vitality and left me dragging myself through each day. I must have been in some kind of denial. I continued working even when I could only just leave my desk to get to the loo, and had to take taxis to and from the office. Eventually, my health collapsed entirely and I had to leave.</p> <p>I spent most of the next five years at home, largely in bed. At worst, I could only sit up for 15 minutes at a time before resting again. I wasn't just tired; I felt very ill. I was diagnosed with ME, a neurological condition that attacks the brain and immune system. Despite the fact that tests commonly find ME sufferers have immunological and hormonal abnormalities, the medical profession is only just beginning to take it seriously.</p> <p>When you've been incapacitated for several years, recovering health may be a gradual process. Very slowly I improved - initially I had maybe an hour or two of productive time a day. Unfortunately, there may be people who remain extremely unwell, or who continually relapse and then go into remission again. The government must make provision for this. It is just as important as rehabilitating those who can work. However, I fear that genuine cases will be overlooked. </p> <p>When I finally felt ready to wean myself off IB, I discovered that the law dictates that claimants are allowed to undertake \"permitted work\" alongside their benefit for up to one year. After this time, they have to return to IB, or give up their benefits and work either full-time or for at least 16 hours a week to qualify for the disability component of working tax credit. Anyone able to work, say, 10 hours a week is breaking the law if they do so, and will have their benefit withdrawn. </p> <p>How foolish - not least financially. Wouldn't the government save money by allowing anyone on the forthcoming ESA to work part-time, when their health allowed, and for an indefinite period? Yearly accounts could be submitted and money docked off benefit, as it is for self-employed people on housing benefit. Crucially, some benefit should remain in place if a person needs it, rather than being whipped away because they've made an effort to work when they are able.</p> <p>I put these points last month to James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, at the No One Written Off consultation event in London. It was the one policy area he tripped up on, and was unable to provide an answer. In fact, he didn't know his own policy, admitting: \"I may be about to expose my ignorance here.\"</p> <p>Nothing has changed. Only those in the ESA \"support\" bracket - the one that a minority qualify for if assessed as being unable to work - will, paradoxically, be allowed to work for less than 16 hours a week permanently if they satisfy limiting criteria, such as if they are under supervision or part of a hospital rehabilitation programme. No one written off? What about the vast numbers who want to work a few hours a week, whenever their health allows?</p> <p>When I first called the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) to discuss the option of starting to do a few hours work a week, I was advised to think very carefully as there is no easy way of doing so, and it's very hard to claw back benefits again if your health fails. The threat of losing your benefit if you relapse is a great disincentive to starting work, so the law must be made more flexible. Illnesses, like the people who have them, do not conform to rigid criteria. I later spent many hours calling benefits helplines and was told much the same thing as by the CAB staff. One particularly candid adviser, frustrated by the hopelessness of a benefit that works against those it is meant to help, told me it was just \"a really shit system\".</p> <p>After much research, I decided to try my hand at writing a few articles and to give the \"permitted work\" scheme a go. It felt like a huge risk and was very stressful, a situation that was not helped by the fact that when one benefit stops, others - such as housing benefit - are often suspended for months while the various departments work out your entitlement. Thankfully, this has just changed, so advisers liaise between government department on a claimant's behalf.</p> <p>I now work part-time. I'm much better, although the ME hasn't yet disappeared altogether. Bit by bit, I've built up work as a freelance journalist, writing articles for newspapers and making features for radio. </p> <p>Labour's five-year strategy aims to get 1 million IB claimants off benefit and into work. I worry that these people are a soft target for a government trying to outflank the Conservatives and prevent any room for manoeuvre over the emotive subject of welfare scroungers. </p> <p>All claimants will have to be reassessed by DWP doctors, who, aware of the number-crunching targets, risk losing their clinical objectivity.</p> <p>The 1 million figure began life before the economic downturn as a great electoral ploy. With 2 million unemployed expected by Christmas, it may become more of a liability. In effect, it may attack the weakest in order to pacify the strongest.</p>",
  "<p>Hamas is receiving a steady revenue licensing illicit tunnels in Gaza's south to smugglers and business people who are importing fuel and other items from Egypt to meet shortages created by Israel's blockade of the Palestinian territory. </p> <p>Hundreds of tents covering entrances to tunnels - big enough to transport through everything from cows to industrial-size air-conditioners - have mushroomed along Gaza's border with Egypt.</p> <p>Many tunnels are also rigged with plastic pipes, siphoning Egypt's heavily subsidised fuel into Gaza where drivers have had to resort to running their cars on cooking oil because Israel cut petrol, diesel and gas supplies to a bare minimum. </p> <p>One fuel station operator, who did not want to be named, said that in the first 19 days of October he imported 313,000 litres (68,860 gallons) of diesel and 161,500 litres of petrol through the tunnels.</p> <p>\"Every day I send my truck to [the border town of] Rafah,\" he said, adding that he was earning 3.5 shekels (55p) on every litre of Egyptian fuel compared with half a shekel on same amount of Israeli fuel.</p> <p>Israel imposed the blockade to weaken Hamas's control of Gaza after the Islamist group ousted their more secular rival, Fatah, 15 months ago. While the siege has brought the territory's economy to a halt, it has done little to weaken Hamas, which has cashed in on the tunnels' business. </p> <p>Smuggling has become a lucrative and entrenched part of the economy. Omar Shaban, a Gaza economist, estimates that smuggling comprises about 90% of market activity in the territory and is worth around $30m (\u00a318m) to $40m a month.</p> <p>He said: \"The tunnels are integrated into the economy. We have a new economic structure now, a new business community.\"</p> <p>One owner, whose tunnel lies within 200 metres of an Egyptian watchtower, operates 24-hours a day, importing \"everything you can imagine\".</p> <p>Last month, Hamas began charging tunnel owners a 10,000-shekel annual licence fee. Most tunnels are located in Rafah, and its mayor, Issa al-Nashar, said there are now about 400 of them. Other sources, however, estimate the number is closer to 600 - and that the fees comprise 20% of the Rafah municipality's revenue. </p> <p>Nashar said the tunnel owners make $10,000 a day and that he wanted to charge much more. \"But we had a discussion with some of the tunnel owners and we agreed on 10,000 shekels,\" he said.</p> <p>Hamas security forces patrol the tunnels, while the municipality has set up a committee to collect the fees. Rafah also requires the owners to pay 1,000 shekels for electricity and is now pressurising them to sign contracts promising to pay up to $40,000 to the families of tunnel workers killed on the job. Forty people have died working in the sandy, unreinforced underground passages so far this year.</p> <p>In a siege-distorted economy - with an estimated 20% inflation rate, 98% of industry forced to close and unemployment at 45% in the first six months of 2008 - the majority of ordinary Palestinians are yet to benefit.</p> <p>Abu Wajdi is one of around 6,000 workers who have flocked to Rafah in search of a job. He is paid only 900 shekels a month, but says he is risking his life because he is a \"patriot\". \"We are participating in lifting the siege. We are trying to fill the market to meet the needs of our people,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The Crown Prosecution Service is considering, yet again, whether to prosecute and possibly imprison otherwise law-abiding Britons for helping their loved ones to die. The parents of Daniel James, a 23-year-old rugby player crippled in a training accident, last month accompanied him to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is legal. In all hundred such cases so far, the director of public prosecutions has declined to act. The law is clearly unfit for purpose.</p> <p>This is not regarded by parliament as a sufficient reason for changing the law. Social reform in Britain occurs not when legislators feel it appropriate but when a heart-rending case achieves mass publicity and good people launch a campaign for change. Such has been the case with laws on homosexuality, prostitution, abortion and self-defence - and perhaps one day will apply to recreational drugs. Westminster inertia always holds sway until it is overcome by an infuriated public.</p> <p>This depends on maintaining a sufficient level of fury. The James case streaked across the media horizon at the weekend, but is fading already. The CPS will probably leave it alone and another opportunity for reform will have passed. Parliament will heave a sigh of relief and return to its fascination with Corfu yachts.</p> <p>There cannot be a human freedom so personal as ordering the circumstances of one's death. Yet Britain is instinctively collectivist, enveloped in prejudice, religion, taboo and prohibition. We are told how to die by the state, with no consideration for individual choice. The 1961 Suicide Act decriminalised the act of suicide, an inherently absurd diktat, but criminalised any assistance to suicide, thus making it illegal to help somebody do something legal.</p> <p>The law of death is a shambles. A leading authority on euthanasia, Professor Emily Jackson of the LSE, began a recent lecture on the subject with the sensational question: \"What is the most common cause of death in Britain?\" Her answer was \"death by killing\". And who does the killing? \"Doctors.\" One third of all registered deaths are by deliberate morphine overdose and one third by the removal of life support, premeditated acts by medical staff.</p> <p>All over Britain, families gather every day of the week in hospitals and discuss with doctors how to bring a dignified death to a loved one, often in a turmoil of grief, indecision, exhaustion and shame. The near universal desire \"to be allowed to die in my own home\" is wilfully disregarded. Parliament's one contribution to this supreme crisis in life's journey is to threaten one and all with suits ranging from negligence to manslaughter.</p> <p>Now judges are in a position to help. Since they cannot realistically prosecute two thirds of the medical profession, nor it seems the few desperate individuals who take their relatives to Switzerland, judges are on the verge of rewriting the law. The stream of visitors to Dignitas may be breaking the law, yet the CPS has not prosecuted one.</p> <p>This state of affairs is being tested in the high court by a 45-year-old MS sufferer Debbie Purdy, who has asked that the DPP reveal the criteria on which he exercises his discretion over whether to prosecute, which he refuses to do. She understandably wants to know if her husband is likely to be imprisoned for taking her to Switzerland to die. Can she regard the 1961 act, as it appears, to be akin to the treason and other archaic acts, and defunct in practice?</p> <p>Purdy is inviting the judicial system to do what parliament has declined to do, which is to define the reasons under which euthanasia will be allowed, if not yet regulated. In this she is supported by a YouGov poll putting support for assisted euthanasia at 86%. A poll for Dignity in Dying records 76% support, and a BMA survey of doctors 56%.</p> <p>The basis on which the authorities in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Oregon allow assisted dying varies. All require evidence of free will on the part of the dying but differ in such preconditions as the possibility of recovery, the extent of pain and the imminence of death.</p> <p>None has led to an epidemic of \"killings\". The safeguards seem robust (compared with those governing hospitals). In more than a decade, Oregon has seen just 431 assisted deaths.</p> <p>The James case, now also under judicial consideration, breaks new ground. The young man's condition was certainly not terminal and his mental state was clear. After a number of failed attempts at suicide, he expressed his wish to escape from \"the prison\" of his crippled body. He did not want to continue \"what he felt was a second-class existence ... in fear and loathing\".</p> <p>He asserted his desire to do something perfectly legal, to take his own life, but was impeded by his disability from doing so. His parents freed him from that impediment. To prosecute them would be an outrage.</p> <p>Only the most warped collectivist could argue that individuals must be kept alive against their will. One anti-euthanasia lobby last week even insisted that assisted suicide \"would deprive the disabled of the benefit of suicide prevention\". To honour this spurious benefit, those wishing to die - and their relatives - must endure unbearable suffering at the bidding of others \"for the good of society as a whole\".</p> <p>I wonder what kind of society that is. Perhaps it is one that used to ban pain relief in childbirth, banned abortion, and held homosexuality a sin. That this should be supported by such prominent churchmen as the archbishop of Canterbury, the archbishop of Westminster and the chief rabbi is astonishing. In years to come, their attitude will seem not just illiberal but cruel.</p> <p>I might do everything I can to persuade the victim of a mortal illness or crippling injury to squeeze the last shred from whatever life still has to offer them. I might plead the example of those who have gone that extra mile and enhanced the lives of others thereby. What cannot be right is for me to deny those whose unfettered judgment has reached a wish to die, the freedom of this, the last of life's great dignities.</p> <p>It is specious to claim that no safeguards can be put in place to protect against abuse. We have safeguards aplenty to regulate such risky social activities as drinking, driving, matrimony and procreation. We can draw up rules to govern the process of dying. This hangover of religious primitivism must surely end. Yet again we must turn to judges rather than members of parliament to uphold a modern liberty.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Peter Preston argues that \"if regulation is good for bankers, pause before decrying Sats and league tables for public services\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/commentanddebate-sats-banking-regulation\">Meddle with them, not us</a>, October 20). When a government pours money into banks, it is right that bankers have to be accountable. And when this government has poured unprecedented billions into public services, public servants - including teachers - have to be accountable too.</p> <p>But Preston seems to think public servants resent this when he says: \"We - in our small, righteous corner - don't require such treatment because we are doing our best.\" He is wrong. Public service unions live in the real world, where taxpayers deserve the best returns on their spending. </p> <p>So we need more precise thinking on why the teachers' unions and their members celebrated the demise of key stage 3 Sats. Preston hints at this: \"To be sure there are differences here: such as the difference between good, intelligent regulation, and bad, mindless rule-making.\" And he acknowledges that regulations \"mean that children are tested regularly and publicly, so that teachers are under constant scrutiny\". But he fails to see that there is too much regulation in schools, creating an overlapping and excessive network - one in which parents and the local community have too little say. </p> <p>In England we have the most data-rich school system in the world. School improvement partners, local authorities and a host of national agencies check performance against targets. Ofsted remains the national inspection agency. Schools are required to evaluate themselves as well. Last week one teacher told me her targets, in a class of 24 GCSE pupils, were 11 A* and 13 A grades - ambition is certainly not lacking in state schools. And never doubt the real accountability to parents, at the school gate in primaries or on the phone in secondaries. </p> <p>As with the majority of other professionals, most teachers are competent, a few are brilliant, and a few are not up to it - but Preston is wrong to recirculate an unsubstantiated claim about \"24,000 incompetent teachers\". We know that some exist, and my union and others are working with the government towards better processes for dealing with them.</p> <p>Of working-class children, Preston says that \"teachers ... wipe away kids' life chances like chalk from a blackboard\". But international educational research tells us that schools make only about 15% difference in a child's educational achievement. The other 85% is the product of a savagely unequal society - in the UK, by the age of three, a middle-class child has heard one million more words than a working-class child. To raise achievement for all young people we must deal with child poverty and social exclusion.</p> <p>The abolition of key stage 3 Sats will free schools to concentrate resources on the most vulnerable pupils and to devise a curriculum which stands a better chance of engaging all their students and motivating them to remain in education beyond 16.</p> <p>Key stage 3 Sats were an unnecessary waste of time, effort and resources; and they damaged the motivation and belief of those children we most want to support, and institutionalised failure in the most vulnerable.

  "<p>There have been some low moments in parliament over the past 11 years, but few so low as today. For this afternoon the human fertilisation and embryology bill is debated for the last time by MPs - and what might well have been the moment when abortion became easier and quicker is instead to be marked by what looks suspiciously like a cave-in to a small group of anti-abortion MPs from Northern Ireland. For as well as reforming the law for women in England, Wales and Scotland, the plan was also to amend the bill to legalise abortion, at last, throughout the UK - removing an injustice from the original 1967 act and relieving the 2,000 or so women who travel from Northern Ireland each year to seek help, and many others who can afford neither the journey nor the fees. They, British citizens and taxpayers, are still driven to illegal abortionists: one in 10 GPs in the province report that they have dealt with the aftermath.</p> <p>Instead, high hopes have fallen victim to what looks like political expediency. The leader of the house, Harriet Harman, who has a fine record on women's rights, has been persuaded that the Lords might use the bill to support the pro-life campaign to cut the limit from 24 to 20 weeks. This is even though the Lords has never before overridden the Commons on abortion. She has allowed all the abortion amendments to be pushed to the back of the debate, where they will fall for lack of time. Women and families everywhere in the UK will be losers. It is shoddy work.</p> <p>This parliamentary trickery can be traced to another controversial Westminster moment: the government's determination to introduce 42-day detention. The vote last June was won only with support from the Democratic Unionists. It has long been rumoured that they were promised there would be no changes to abortion law affecting Northern Ireland, an egregious example of cheap political advantage which ignores the government's commitment to promoting reproductive rights and maternal health around the world. It is bowing, it would seem, to what one blogger calls the Stormont Boys Club. And as a result, changes that would benefit women elsewhere in the UK will also fall, even though the evidence supports reform and both doctors' and nurses' professional organisations back them, particularly the removal of the requirement for the signature of two doctors, and the introduction of nurse-administered abortion-inducing drugs in early pregnancy. Both changes would make a big contribution towards reaching the government target of ending 70% of unwanted pregnancies in the first nine weeks. Delay in this vital objective fuels the pro-life lobby - and could jeopardise all that has been achieved.</p>",
  "<p>One is the 44-year-old descendant of slaves who gives passionate speeches on the campaign trail and is a fan of Stevie Wonder. The other is a multimillionaire businesswoman, 10 years older, who keeps in the background and prefers the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>In the battle of the would-be first ladies, the contrast could not be more profound. Michelle Obama and Cindy McCain have little in common in their backgrounds or style, and the gulf is likely to be reflected in the approach adopted by whichever one takes up residence in the White House next January.</p> <p>Obama has been highly active during the presidential race. She has made frequent forays into battleground states, matching her husband's skills as an orator in solo appearances. But since the summer, when she was criticised for an unguarded comment that her husband's success had made her feel proud of her country for the first time, she has been careful to present herself foremost as mother and wife.</p> <p>The tactic was visible in a recent stump speech she made in Indiana, which the Democrats hope to win for the first time since 1964. \"I've come here first as a wife,\" she began, \"who has seen my husband grow and stand strong and knows in my soul without a doubt that he will be an extraordinary president.\" She talked of \"tucking in our children and grandchildren at night\" and referred to her husband as \"babe\". But she also dwelt on politics, stressing the need for universal healthcare, affordable college education and troop withdrawal from Iraq.</p> <p>McCain, by contrast, has cut a quieter figure. She is usually to be seen standing behind her husband dressed in an immaculate Escada suit in almost regal silence. She speaks rarely and then fleetingly, the one exception being her 20-minute oration to the Republican national convention last month.</p> <p>Michelle Obama came from a working-class family in a black neighbourhood on the south side of Chicago, attending the largely white institutions of Princeton and Harvard to emerge as a lawyer and then as a senior manager in a Chicago hospital.</p> <p>Cindy McCain had a more conventional trajectory. Born in Phoenix where she still lives, she was a state rodeo queen and a cheerleader in the University of Southern California, where she studied special education. She met her husband - then married to someone else - in 1979, bringing to their union a fortune inherited from her father's beer distribution firm, which she now chairs. Her wealth is put at more than $100m (\u00a358.8m), including eight houses that landed her husband in trouble when he was unable to put a number to them.</p> <p>Cindy McCain's biographer, Alicia Colon, believes her bearing in the White House would be marked by diffidence. She would eschew promoting policy, and would not follow Rosalynn Carter's example and sit in cabinet meetings. \"She is not very political and the only reason she agreed with John McCain's decision to run again is because she feels he is the best person to lead the country in these perilous times,\" Colon said.</p> <p>McCain herself sees her main function as her husband's sounding board. \"I'm the one person who will tell him in the end exactly what I think and what's wrong,\" she told a TV interviewer. She has said she would focus on adoption, a subject dear to her heart after she brought home a child from Bangladesh in 1991, famously presenting the baby to her husband without notice, with the words \"this is your new daughter\". </p> <p>She would also use the role to encourage volunteering, and to bring public attention to addiction, a personal cause that stems from her three-year addiction to painkillers in the early 1990s. She sees Princess Diana's charitable activities as a role model, she has told reporters.</p> <p>Myra Gutin, author of The First Lady in the 20th Century, divides past first ladies into three categories. There are those who saw their job as largely ceremonial - the White Housekeepers as she has dubbed them - such as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower. Then there is the class of what Gutin calls \"emerging spokeswomen\" - those who made use of the influence the White House offered as a podium to address the country. She puts Jacqueline Kennedy and both the Bushes, Barbara and Laura, into this group.</p> <p>Finally, there are the activists, such as Lady Bird Johnson, who helped draft legislation, Betty Ford, who openly disagreed with some of Gerald's policies, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who went as far as to hire presidential aides.</p> <p>Gutin predicts that were McCain to become first lady she would be an emerging spokeswoman. \"She is certainly not a shrinking violet, but nor is she comfortable in the public spotlight.\"</p> <p>But with opinion polls swinging steadily towards the Democrats, it is likely that Obama will be the one to inherit Laura Bush's title. If so, she will be America's first black first lady, a historic distinction which, combined with her inherent political instincts, would shape her approach.</p> <p>Obama, Gutin believes, would fall into the activist mould. \"That's more in tune with her personality and her relationship with her husband, who would encourage her to take the lead in a project, probably in the area of education.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Obama would be aware of the difficulties Hillary Clinton got into when she took on a full policy portfolio, healthcare reform, soon after entering the White House. Clinton's failed initiative damaged her own reputation and sapped the political strength of the president, Bill.</p> <p>Obama has indicated she would be unlikely to follow Hillary's example and set up a base inside the West Wing of the White House; she would confine herself to the family section in the East Wing. She would also suspend her work as a lawyer to avoid conflicts of interest, and focus on issues such as the work-life balance affecting working women.</p> <p>Her priority, as it has been during the punishing two years of the presidential race, would be to provide a modicum of normality for her daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, seven.</p>",
  "<p>It's a deal nobody likes, but if the <a href=\"http://www.rttnews.com/Content/GeneralNews.aspx?Node=B1&amp;Id=744638\">Iraqi and US governments</a> fail to reach a legally binding status of forces agreement by the end of December, startling consequences could quickly ensue. US troops would be required to cease all land and air operations; all military personnel would be confined to base; and preparations for wholesale withdrawal would begin.</p> <p>That eventuality would be met with a cheer or three by Iraqis opposed to continuing occupation \u2013 a majority, according to opinion polls \u2013 and by opponents of Iraq policy in Europe and the US. Making the point, thousands of followers of the radical Shia cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD93SQ8LO0\">took to Baghdad's streets</a> on Saturday to demand that the US, Britain and the rest get out immediately.</p> <p>The prospect of a sudden, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/iraq-usa\">involuntary US exit</a> has also been moved closer by the belated realisation that the UN security council, bypassed by George Bush before the 2003 invasion, might be reluctant to extend the occupying powers mandate it subsequently agreed. Veto-wielding Russia, still smarting over the Georgia row, could in theory refuse to go along.</p> <p>Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, says he is confident it will not come to that and a deal will done by Christmas. Others are not so sure. Last week, aides to Iraq's prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601081&amp;sid=awzMnOuviHOw&amp;refer=australia\">Nouri al-Maliki</a>, outlined a draft agreement replacing the UN mandate with a bilateral pact allowing US forces to stay until 2011, but Shia parties within Maliki's ruling coalition have since blocked it.</p> <p>The Iraqi cabinet <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hwK_CSpBxsNuVUEaDuOwmSSCiqGwD93UU05O1\">met again today</a> to discuss the draft terms, but final agreement was not expected and the foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, predicted the required parliamentary vote would not be held until after next month's US presidential election.</p> <p>Shia parties controlling 85 of parliament's 275 seats, including the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council and Maliki's Dawa party, object to the draft for two main reasons. One is that it allows America's tenure to be extended after 2011 if both sides agree. That has raised the spectre of an ongoing US military presence entrenched in quasi-permanent bases \u2013 something the Pentagon, despite much scepticism, insists it does not want.</p> <p>The second objection is that US nationals who commit crimes under Iraqi law will not be subject to Iraqi justice other than in exceptional circumstances. That, say some lawmakers, is a further affront to Iraq's battered sovereignty.</p> <p>Other considerations are at work. Iraqi officials privately admit they need US military support, particularly air cover and help with logistics and training, for the foreseeable future. While Maliki apparently accepts this, he is also an Iraqi nationalist proud of the progress the country's reformulated, 600,000-strong security forces have made in subduing problem areas such as Basra and Sadr City in Baghdad.</p> <p>Analysts suspect Maliki would like to see the back of the Americans before 2011 if it could be managed \u2013 hence his feting this summer of Democrat Barack Obama, who proposes a 16-month withdrawal deadline. Like fellow Shia and Sunni politicians, he knows feeble acceptance of a continuing US occupation could severely dent voter support in upcoming provincial and general elections. Members of the main Sunni Muslim Tawafiq, or Accordance bloc are making similar calculations.</p> <p>Ironically perhaps, Bush doesn't much like the deal on the table either. Like the Republican presidential candidate John McCain, he has always resisted setting firm timetables. His senior general, David Petraeus, went out of his way recently to warn of the several \"potential storm clouds\" that still threatened \u2013 including simmering sectarianism, the status of Kirkuk, religious persecution as in Mosul, the relationship with Kurdistan, oil revenue-sharing and the rights of returning refugees.</p> <p>According to Petraeus, who now heads <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/nato-afghanistan\">US Central Command</a> overseeing the entire Middle East, all these considerations argue for a slow, careful approach to Iraq troop draw-downs.</p> <p>American caution directly relates to another key factor: arch-enemy Iran's continuing attempts to manipulate Iraqi politics for its own ends. Tehran wants the Americans out right now and is lobbying hard against the draft pact. So hard, in fact, that the US commander, General Ray Odierno, accused Iran last week of bribing MPs. His claim brought a sharp rebuke from Maliki who said, rather portentously, that Odierno \"had risked his position\".</p> <p>The US-Iranian struggle for influence in post-occupation Iraq is a coming story \u2013 and Maliki and his fellow nationalists are caught in the middle. Manoeuvring against the importunate Americans may make short-term political sense, even if it ignores security realities. But Iran's ongoing machinations also threaten the recovery of national sovereignty.</p> <p>With a foot in both camps but belonging to neither, Maliki doesn't want to choose between the two.</p>",

  "<p>This was a strange game in some ways. Celtic were outpassed and outmanoeuvred by Manchester United at Old Trafford, yet still emerged feeling justifiably hard done by. United's first two goals might well have been ruled out by the linesman. Still, the final scoreline didn't flatter the European champions. </p> <p>Dimitar Berbatov was the attacking star. Albeit at home and against a team of limited attacking ambition, this was a totally convincing, and totally committed display of centre forward play. Never mind the two close range (and probably offside) goals. For a man famed for not running much, he really did run a lot. </p> <p>This was Berbatov in motion: shuttling out to the right wing, chasing the full-backs down and always looking potent in possession. There were choice moments. The finish for the first goal was nifty. The control and sideswipe to Ronaldo after he had been tackled on the edge of the Celtic box in the first half were sublime \u2013 playground football from a man completely in control of what he wanted to do with the ball. </p> <p>Perhaps Berbatov had been stung into action by some of the superlatives being hurled at his striking partner. The transformation in Wayne Rooney's fortunes in the last month has been dramatic \u2013 not to mention hysterically received. Just five weeks ago, on Berbatov's United debut at Anfield, it was Rooney who found himself marginalised in a right-wing role. </p> <p>Never mind: eight goals in six games for club and country before tonight and suddenly Rooney was being described, in all seriousness, as the best player in the world. The truth, as ever, lies somewhere short of that. Being the best exceedingly promising creative English attacker in the Premier League will do for now. </p> <p>Here Rooney began the game forward of Berbatov, who came deep in search of the ball. It didn't last. Within the first quarter of an hour Rooney was already back in his own half taking the ball from his defence. He duly dropped into that withdrawn central position and by half time he'd begun to hum with now-familiar purpose. Another goal and an intermittently vibrant display confirmed his fine form. </p> <p>The corollary to Rooney's surging stock has been a rather over-egged collapse in confidence in last year's world-beater, Cristiano Ronaldo. He was again muted, a player visibly groping his way back after surgery. Murky body language or not, there's little to be gained from minutely analysing the performances of a player easing towards full fitness. He trudged and moped a bit, but that's just something Ronaldo does during games; even, at times, during those mesmeric away performances in Europe last year. </p> <p>It's away in the Champions League that you feel United will really derive benefit from their new centre-forward. Here Berbatov held the ball as much through Velcro control and sleight of foot as through bodily strength, slowing the play down and luring his team-mates forward to join him.</p> <p>His finish for the first goal was subtle and deceptively easy \u2013 as well as offside. That was a shame for Celtic who had begun with intent and a quietly gathering confidence, so much so that it once again seemed strange they had managed to avoid victory in 18 precious Champions League away games. </p> <p>Was United's second goal offside? Certainly Berbatov was offside when Ronaldo hit the free-kick that was palmed out to him. Was Berbatov simply loitering, Ruud van Nistelrooy-style awaiting a second \"phase of play\" that began when Artur Boruc pushed the ball back? Certainly, it might easily have gone the other way and both Berbatov goals were very hard on Celtic. </p> <p>Before tonight Gordon Strachan voiced his concern that the team he put out might be on the short side. And so they were: short on possession and a touch short of ambition. </p> <p>Against this, Celtic were long on other things: spirit, energy and commitment. They lined up in a 4-4-1-1, with Shunsuke Nakamura and Scott Brown sporadically breaking forward to support Scott McDonald. In defence they provided a yellow-shirted scrimmage, a frantic, seething closing down of space thirty yards from goal. They did it well for periods in the first half and for all their massed defending did force the only two real saves of the first 20 minutes. Gary Caldwell had an excellent start in the anchor role sweeping in front of his defence. </p> <p>Still, these kinds of tactics rarely succeed in the Premier League at Old Trafford. By the hour mark, when Berbatov was withdrawn, it was already clear United would win this game. With Berbatov settling in to provide a genuine \u2013 and genuinely high-class \u2013 attacking focus, United have plenty to look forward to.</p>",

(A friend of mine who was at the debate said the crowd gasped at McCain's callous disregard for women's health.)\"</p> <p>According to McCain, the term \"health of the mother\" has been \"stretched by the extreme pro-abortion\" movement to mean almost anything. Yes, women's health encompasses many aspects, and thank goodness for that. One of the reasons women live longer than men is because we have to deal with reproductive health with such frequency, and thus see our doctors more often and are generally in better touch with our bodies. McCain and Sarah Palin would seem to want women to live in the dark ages again, with <a href=\"http://www.renodiscontent.com/2008/10/15/mccain-mocks-womens-health-during-debate/\">limited access to contraception and limited knowledge</a>.</p> <p>The McCain air-quote comment came in the midst of a serious back and forth on the ban on late-term abortions in this country, which George Bush signed into law in 2003. With respect to late-term abortion, Obama is against it, but he believes strongly there must be an exception when the mother's health is at risk. So do <a href=\"http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:V_xqC1syv9cJ:abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/883a29PartialBirthAbortion.pdf+americans+support+ban+on+partial+birth+abortion+health+exception+for+the+mother&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a\">most Americans</a>. Although over 60% believe such procedures should be banned, 60% also believe that if the mother's health is at risk, such a procedure should be allowed under law. </p> <p>And McCain? He has become more virulently anti-choice over the years. That's OK with me. I wouldn't vote for an anti-choice candidate, but I also wouldn't vote only on choice. The McCain comment, however, is just one more indication that he has very little understanding about what is important to American women. And nor, it appears, does he want to.<br>Although <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/advocates_slam.html\">choice advocates</a> maintain the air-quote gaffe is about abortion rights, I think it's about something much more fundamental. McCain has repeatedly <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2008/06/07/mccain-and-womens-issues-its-more-than-just-roe/\">denigrated women</a> in word and deed, including <a href=\"http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2008/04/straight-talk-e.html\">his own wife</a>.</p> <p>Frankly, that's between him and Cindy. But mocking women's health is not OK, especially with McCain so baldly seeking white women's votes with his choice of Palin as vice-president. Well, that <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/blogs/margie-omero/\">backfired</a>, and <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/\">white women's support for McCain</a> meets, or is lower than, pre-Palin levels. </p> <p>McCain is a mystery to me. At the debates, he's seemed angry, almost manic. His stupid mocking of women's health, even when put into the context of an issue he may feel very strongly about, is bad politics, and it's harmful. In a year when women, especially married white women, have been told their vote is paramount, how does it feel to have a presidential candidate mock the very thing that's most crucial to anyone: her health?</p>",
  "<p>President Ahmadinejad <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100803527.html\">has had to cave into strikers across Iran</a>. <a href=\"http://survey07.ituc-csi.org/getcountry.php?IDCountry=IRN&amp;IDLang=EN\">Strikes are illegal</a>, so how is it that industrial action succeeded when years of strikes by factory workers and government employees have been brutally put down? Well, this was a strike by not just your average group of workers.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of small shops make up the labyrinthine bazaars of Tehran and together their owners comprise the class that legitimises the Iranian government. Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor would be nothing without the bazaaris. <a href=\"http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do?id=290507\">Authors Andreas Malm and Shora Esmailian</a>, in Iran on the Brink characterise the centuries-old bazaar as something that fosters a powerful petit bourgeoisie every bit as much as the coal-mines of 19th-century Europe fostered a proletariat. Well, President Ahmadinejad just had the gall to take them on. And he lost.</p> <p>It was the Shah's dreams of demolishing the bazaars that, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199603/kaplan-iran\">finally, cost him</a> \u2013 and his US backers \u2013 his throne. The bazaaris together with the clerical class outflanked the left and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-versus-the-west-the-view-from-the-tehran-bazaar-436566.html\">sewed up the coalition</a> that has ruled Iran since the Islamic Revolution. Somehow, President Ahmadinejad thought <a href=\"http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8707190745\">he could implement a 3% VAT charge</a> on the class that keeps him in power.</p> <p>There were general strikes in the bazaars of Isfahan, Mashhad, Tabriz and Tehran. \"Asshole\" was what they were calling the president when I went through the alleys of Tehran's dusty bazaar where gruff traders work long hours to maintain some of the richest livelihoods in Iran. \"Why should we pay tax when none of Khamenei's cronies do? Do you think Rafsanjani pays sales tax?\" He was referring to former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, chairman of the assembly of experts which theoretically chooses Ayatollah Khamanei's successor. Rafsanjani also chairs the expediency council which mediates between parliament and those who vet parliamentary candidates, and his family is <a href=\"http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/2003/July/Rich/\">very, very rich</a>.</p> <p>After the jewellery trader gave me some tea, he changed the numbers on a digital board to reflect the creeping rise in gold prices and said he had had enough of Ahmadinejad. He said his friends on the Bonyad-e Mostazafin or Foundation of the Oppressed would destroy the president. The <a href=\"http://www.ecssr.ac.ae/CDA/en/FeaturedTopics/DisplayTopic/0,1670,502-98-43,00.html\">Bonyads</a> are \"charitable\" institutions that dominate the economy. This Bonyad, exempt from any auditing or taxes, produces two-thirds of all the bricks, tyres and chemicals in the country. They even produce the home-grown, <a href=\"http://deconstructinghairy.blogspot.com/2008/05/holy-cola-war.html\">anti-imperialist cola</a>, Zam-Zam, which traces its roots to the days when bazaaris's pressured the government to kick Pepsi out of the country because it was hurting the bazaars' lemonade makers. I asked about strikes being illegal and he said that if Ahmadinejad didn't cancel the tax, the bazaaris would have students, doctors and nurses out on the streets in support. \"We would overthrow the government just like we did in 1979!\"</p> <p>\"Why are we spending all our money on Hizbollah and Hamas when we need money here?\" he asked, \"at least gold prices will soon rise because of George Bush.\"</p> <p>I walked through the maze of stalls selling microwaves, carpets, chadors, pots and pans, stationery and duvets and out towards the late 18th-century mosque scarred by scaffolding with its courtyard of switched-off fountains. It was as quiet as I had ever seen it. Within hours, Ahmadinejad ordered the economy ministry to back down. Parliament had approved the tax last year and finally summoned up the courage to implement it only to find itself powerless in the face of the merchants.</p> <p>Official inflation is around 30% and when the government sent a minister, <a href=\"http://www.parstimes.com/law/taxation_system.html\">Ali Akbar Arab-Mazar</a>, to pacify Isfahan's bazaar, he was told to go back to Tehran. Trying to put a brave face on it, Ahmadinejad's new finance minister, Shamsoddin Hosseini said on TV that the government should have explained things better. As things stand, it looks like Ahmadinejad cannot implement any of the plans drawn up by his economic advisers. What they fail to understand is that <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/28/business/ihousing.php\">the influx of foreign remittances pump up the skyrocketing property markets</a> of Iran's big cities. That's where the inflation comes from.</p> <p>Already, the perception that there is less of an imminent threat from Israel or the United States is causing problems for the Iranian government. It has been relying on the external menace to prop up political power and the less Bush talks, the more room there is in Iran for dissent. Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zoPgv_nYg\">only John McCain</a> can save a regime that smells both of Soviet communism and the Sicilian Mafia. Then again, Senator <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/vcCandidateFeed7/idUSN0749229520081009\">Obama's desire for more sanctions</a> will help the Iranian government, too.</p>",
  "<p>A \"perfect storm\" could be building for the US election day because of a combination of sky-high voter interest, new ballot machines and a shortage of poll staff, the independent Pew organisation warned today.</p> <p>The Washington-based group set out a long string of problems still facing the US in spite of reforms aimed at avoiding a repeat of the 2000 and 2004 debacles.</p> <p>The launch of the 77-page report at a Washington press conference came against a background of legal clashes over voter registration and hours-long queues already forming outside booths set up for early voting in states across the US. Voting is now under way in 46 of the 50 states, though election day is still almost a fortnight away.</p> <p>Virginia, a battleground state, announced today it is to step up security at polling booths on November 4. Election officials fear trouble because of passions aroused by the election, by long queues or by people being told they are not eligible to vote.</p> <p>Doug Chapin, director of Pew's electionline.org, said: \"People talk about meltdown. It is undeniable that the election system is going to face its biggest-ever test.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It is over-optimistic to think that 130m people can vote and something does not go wrong ... We have spent eight years sorting the plumbing but on November 4 we are going to crank up the system.\"</p> <p>The pressure is mainly because the excitement created by Barack Obama could result in a record turnout, with African Americans and young voters, both traditionally notorious for failing to vote, predicted to cast ballots in large numbers this time round.</p> <p>New voters are registering in record numbers in almost every state.</p> <p>Election officials in Virginia recently ordered 200,000 additional voter registration forms.</p> <p>Thousands of lawyers are being recruited by Obama and John McCain to police the polling booths, offering advice to supporters denied the vote or to challenge the eligibility of rivals.</p> <p>Pew is one of the most respected research organisations in the US, and<br>publishes annual updates on the state of the election process.</p> <p>Today's report, Election Preview 2008: What if we had an election and everyone came?, says: \"Eight years after the uncovered problems in the 2000 election and more than five years after the creation of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, millions of Americans will head to the polls on November 4 in what many are predicting will be the highest turnout election in recent memory.</p> <p>\"Like the infamous Nor'easter that sank the Andrea Gail, another perfect storm may be brewing, only this one has the potential to combine a record turnout with an insufficient number of poll workers and a voting system still in flux.\"</p> <p>Election officials are struggling in some places to recruit the tens of thousands of extra staff that will be needed.</p> <p>Another problem for election officials is the electronic voting systems introduced in many states after the \"hanging chads\" mess in Florida in 2000.</p> <p>The report notes that voting machines bought only six years ago have been replaced in Florida, California and other states after election officials and Congress became concerned about security and reliability.</p> <p>Some states and counties have returned to paper, but with optical scanners that should theoretically allow for faster counting. This amounts to the third change since 2000.</p> <p>One of the biggest flashpoints is voter registration, particularly in states such as Ohio, Indiana, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Missouri.</p> <p>Chapin said there is fierce litigation in Indiana and Georgia, where recently-adopted rules require voters to show photo IDs. Republicans claim this it aimed at preventing voter fraud, while Demococrats argue that it is a form of voter suppression.</p> <p>There is also conflict over whether students can vote in the counties where they are attending university or whether they should be registered in their home states.</p> <p>Chapin said that one of the reasons why elections were such an issue in the US was that, unlike other democracies where organisation is done centrally, they are handled at state and county level.</p> <p>The report identifies 12 states where there could be problems on election day because of lack of poll workers, new voting machines or voter registration rows: Washington DC, Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia.</p> <p>Officials are encouraging early voting and absentee ballots to try to relieve the pressure on November 4.</p>",
  "<p>The day Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac finally fell, six long weeks ago, and the government stepped in with hundreds of billions of dollars of loan guarantees, I was returning from a weekend trip to <a href=\"http://www.goldengatephoto.com/WestUS/halfdometrip.html\">Yosemite</a>. The day before, my friend Jason and I had scaled Half Dome rock.</p> <p>Half Dome is nearly two miles above sea level. To get to it, you have to walk nearly five miles, up steep, winding mountain paths. Then, your legs weak and lungs burning, you have to climb up hundreds of steep steps cut into the granite. Finally, you reach a plateau; you lie down and try to get your body back under control; and then you go for the summit. To reach it is a leap of faith. Half Dome is too steep to walk up; but one small part of the cliff face is \"only\" at a 45 degree angle. Pairs of stakes have been hammered into the rock at 10 or 20 feet intervals; and steel cables threaded along them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yosemitevacation.com/_hd-photo_gallery.htm#Gallery\">To conquer Half Dome</a>, you have to pull yourself up 400 feet of cables. You take deep breaths, haul yourself from one set of stakes to the next, wedge your feet against the wooden slats at each set of stakes; and then repeat the process. If you fall, there's absolutely nothing to stop you \u2013 a terrifying fact you're reminded of every few minutes when someone drops their water bottle. Fall at just the right angle and you'll land hundreds of feet below with broken bones galore, but alive; fall at a slightly different angle and you slide off the edge of the cliff and drop thousands of feet to the valley floor.</p> <p>So, what does this have to do with our current economic woes? Well, we know we've lost our footing and fallen from a great height. In the weeks since Freddie and Fannie were essentially nationalised, investment banks and thrift banks have failed, credit markets have frozen, investors started runs on money market accounts, banks the world over have been semi-nationalised, trillions of dollars of taxpayers' money has been put on the line to support the system, stock markets have dived and several countries have themselves veered towards insolvency. That much is a given. What we don't yet know \u2013 and won't for months, possibly even years \u2013 is the extent of the damage. Will our economies and societies emerge battered but alive? Or will the system of exchange and wealth creation that we have taken for granted for generations prove unfixable?</p> <p>If that sounds melodramatic, it's meant to be. We're in the midst of the sort of collective re-imagining of national and global institutions, of the obligations of government and the needs of citizenries, that occurs perhaps once every couple of generations. </p> <p>At the end of the day, governments will emerge from the near-meltdown of the global financial system either larger or smaller. If they succeed in staunching the fiscal haemorrhage, governments will emerge much larger \u2013 with ownership stakes in pillars of the economy, with roles as extensive regulators and arbiters of the marketplace that they have not previously had, and with populations demanding they use that new clout not just to keep financial markets solvent but to keep populations out of poverty \u2013 through, for example, new health coverage systems and new employment schemes. If they fail, recession will turn into depression, tax revenues will shrivel, meaning that governments, too, will contract, and even the most powerful nations will find their organs of state incapable of mitigating the consequences of the meltdown. Within that broad range of possibilities the one thing we can be pretty certain of is that governing apparatuses and international relations won't emerge looking identical to how they did going in to 2008.</p> <p>In the desperate days before France fell to the Nazis, Churchill and the French government parlayed about the possibility of <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/pss/260024\">merging France and the United Kingdom</a> into one country. In the years after the second world war and the explosion of two atomic bombs over Japan, many scholars pondered the possibility of world government as a way to avoid competing nations marching toward nuclear catastrophe.</p> <p>Both of those ideas hadn't a snowball in hell's chance of success, but they did in some ways affect the timbre of international relations. England and France never unified, but during the 60 years following the end of the war the European Union emerged as a continental entity with at least some supranational governing responsibilities. World government was never a serious option, but the United Nations has remained a durable institution and organisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IMF and the World Bank have operated, with varying degrees of success, on a transnational basis for many decades.</p> <p>So, as the current order crumbles, how about a bit more emphasis on the eirenic? The 15th and 16th century scholar <a href=\"http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/erasmus.html\">Desiderius Erasmus</a> advocated a system of international relations based around harmony and fairness rather than competition and warfare. As new domestic institutions, along with a new system of international relations, emerges out of the failed economic experiment of the past three decades, let's start a real conversation about who's included in the new system. Already responses to the crisis are being hammered out not by the G-8 but by the G-20. That's a start, but it still leaves unconsidered the interests of the billions of people living outside these 20 large economies.</p> <p>There's been a lot of talk in America recently about saving the middle classes; as well as propping up the structure of the first world economy upon which global prosperity depends. And I certainly don't underestimate the importance of that. But there's a risk that attention to poverty, to domestic working classes and impoverished peoples overseas, gets lost in this mix. </p> <p>Both Barack Obama and John McCain have gone out of their way to appeal to the struggling middle class in the US election. Partly that's because the vast majority of Americans, no matter how blue collar they might be, self-identifies as either middle class or as aspiring to attain middle-class status. But partly it's because there's more political capital to be gained from paying attention to people who've lost thousands of dollars in their 401(k)s than to people who never had <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401K\">401(k)s</a> to begin with. The wealthier you are in America, the more likely you are to vote. That's been true for decades.</p> <p>Obama's economic package at least talks about raising the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation; and his advocacy of a three-month halt to home foreclosures would give at least some reprieve to working families teetering on the edge of personal catastrophe. McCain, by contrast, does little more than advocate more tax cuts \u2013 which doesn't really address the problem of a growing underclass too poor to pay significant amounts of taxes in the first place, already reliant on government and charity food subsidies, and increasingly unable to establish decent credit, relying instead on exorbitantly high interest payday loans, check-cashing outlets, and pawn shops for their borrowing needs. </p> <p>Commentators have spent much time analysing Obama and McCain's differing body language in their third debate. To my mind, the most interesting moment was when McCain challenged Obama on why he opposed a free-trade agreement with Columbia. Obama answered that labour leaders in Colombia were being targeted by death squads. The camera panned to Mccain; as Obama talked of trade union leaders being assassinated, the Republican rolled his eyes.</p> <p>I think at this point we can take it as a given that Obama is more concerned with the rights of working people than is McCain. But that doesn't necessarily mean Obama's talking in strong enough terms about poverty in the post-fall era.</p> <p>If we're going to set up new institutions to mediate money-flows, let's set up some system to invest in developing countries, especially around tackling the issue of global warming. Last year the <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/climatechange/\">United Nations Development Programme</a> issued a report detailing how poorer nations needed access to billions of dollars to alleviate the affects of already-unleashed climate change; and billions more to upgrade their energy systems so as to be able to move into a post-carbon age and limit any further planetary temperature increases. Without it, they warned, poor regions would see increased drought, water shortages, epidemics and starvation.</p> <p>At the same time, let's have a serious conversation about developing bigger and better micro-lending institutions, so that small business owners and farmers around the world can survive the hard times ahead, and, down the road, move their families toward economic security. Let's talk about renegotiating poor countries' debt obligations; after all, if first world governments can buy up trillions of dollars in \"toxic debt\" from banks, why can they not perform a similar function for development-hindering debt owed by poorer nations? That wouldn't mean a canceling of debt, but rather a renegotiation, akin to the notion of revamping the corrosive variable rate sub-prime mortgages pushing so many US families into homelessness.</p> <p>These are just a few anti-poverty measures that could be taken. Many more could, and should, be developed over the coming years.</p> <p>Early on in the Democratic primary season, John Edwards talked passionately about a fairer deal for America's poor. Like Bobby Kennedy 40 years earlier, he went beyond mere platitudes about \"Main Street\" and the hurting middle classes. As we enter the final days of the presidential race, and start imagining the new institutions, the new social compact that a post-financial meltdown world demands, there's even more urgency that issues of engrained poverty, both in the US and overseas, are addressed in a smart, transnational manner.</p>",
  "<p>The \"theft of wardrobe doors\" scenario has, apparently, become a familiar tale among extradition lawyers. The story goes like this: carpenter fits wardrobe doors, his client fails to pay, so the carpenter removes the wardrobe doors. </p> <p>Such a chain of events would be unlikely to trouble the UK's criminal courts. Or anyone, frankly. Even if the disgruntled client were to press charges against the obstinate carpenter, and even if there were evidence that wardrobe doors had indeed been removed against their owner's will, the Crown Prosecution Service would still have to apply the test of whether it served the public interest to prosecute. Uprooting the honest carpenter with no history of offending from his hardworking family life over a dispute about payment would be unlikely to pass.</p> <p>If, however, the events took place in Poland and the carpenter was a Polish national now living in Britain, a different ending emerges. Under the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm\">European Arrest Warrant</a> system (EAW), EU members including the UK now extradite citizens of other member states back to where they came from with few questions asked. The idea is to simplify criminal proceedings within the EU, the presumption being that, from one European human rights-bound state to another, suspected criminals will surely receive humane treatment and a fair trial on their return. </p> <p>In some cases, this has happened. The UK has been able to extradite foreign suspects wanted for serious crimes in other EU countries. Similarly UK citizens at large in the EU zone have been returned for investigation into crimes at home. </p> <p>Less predictable, however, has been Poland's use of the EAW to request a breathtaking number of extraditions for cases described by judges and lawyers alike as trivial. By \"trivial\", they mean <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/20/immigration-extradition-poland-lithuania-law\">allegations</a> of theft relating to wardrobe doors, a pedal bike, or a dessert. Each case requires specialist extradition agents from Scotland Yard, extradition solicitors, barristers, interpreters and precious court time before one of only five judges in the country able to hear extradition cases. The Metropolitan Police have had to start chartering regular planes back to Poland just to cope.</p> <p>The explanation for this seemingly bizarre use of state time and resources lies in the Polish system of \"compulsory prosecution\" or <em>zasada legalizmu</em>. All allegations of crime in Poland must be investigated, and once reasonable suspicion has been established, all offences must be prosecuted. Investigation requires the presence of the suspect and, if the suspect has made his way to the UK, extradition is required.</p> <p>Harmonisation of criminal justice systems within the EU is a long way off and in the meantime Poland is entitled to its own system of charge and prosecution. Nevertheless, this apparent clash of attitudes towards prosecution is having a very clear effect. The British courts are struggling to cope. The sheer number of Polish extradition cases, a \"huge volume\" of which, according to the Met Police, relate to the kind of one-off, minor offences that would not be pursued had they taken place here, seems wildly disproportionate. </p> <p>But more than that, these cases raise questions about the principle of an extradition system based on \"mutual trust\" \u2013 described by a judge as \"the important underlying assumption ... that member states, sharing common values and recognising common rights, can and should trust the integrity and fairness of each other's judicial systems\". </p> <p>Although Polish law is apparently proving the most annoying challenge to this doctrine, it is my no means the most serious. Other former members of the Eastern bloc have been working hard to push the concept of \"mutual trust\" to its absolute limit. Bulgaria and Latvia, for example, have repeatedly been accused of violating basic human rights standards by providing detention facilities with no exercise or natural light, no toilet facilities except a bucket shared among numerous detainees, infestations of fleas and scabies and food shared with mice and rats. </p> <p>Poland does not stand accused of violating rights on this scale. It is simply flooding the courts at a time when they are already struggling to cope with a massive shortfall in funding \u2013 a situation which looks unlikely to improve in the near future. In the era of \"tough choices\", do we really want to persist in extraditing Poles for stealing desserts? And if so, at what cost?</p>",

  "<p>There are perhaps not a few citizens of the world disappointed that there have been no credible sightings of erstwhile Masters of the Universe defenestrating themselves from the Temples of Mammon on Wall Street.

He cites the very conservative Daily Mail inveighing against the British labour government because the credit crunch has made it slow in paying out funeral grants to the families of <br>the impoverished deceased. It highlights the decadence of a welfare state for American conservatives \u2013 socialised death care as well as healthcare \u2013 no wonder the British Empire fell!</p> <p>I should declare an interest. I once wrote a column advocating \"synergistic dialectical investing\" and as a joke invested my annual <br>pension contribution in <a href=\"http://www.sci-corp.com/SCICORP/home.aspx\">Service Corporation International</a>, the world's biggest chain of funeral homes, and <a href=\"http://www.philipmorrisinternational.com/pmintl/pages/eng/default.asp\">Philip Morris</a>, on the grounds that death and taxes are inevitable, and tobacco would help them both along.</p> <p>As an investment, the joke has paid off six-fold, but SCI has not done as well as I anticipated. This month the credit crunch <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1452\">killed off its takeover bid</a> for the second biggest chain of morticians, Stewart.</p> <p>From cradle to grave, the credit bust has no end of ramifications. Overcoming it will be a stiff task.</p> <p>It raises the question about the billions of dollars put aside pre-need by Americans in the confident expectation that it will pay for them to be gutted, pickled in toxic fluids and sealed in expensive caskets with (as I recall in one trade publication) \"a lifetime guarantee\".</p> <p>Can they really trust the finance industry not to assume that since you cannot take it with you, we may as well take it from you now? Hoping that someone will follow in my footsteps when we did a quick and clean funeral for my father (at his request), it is not an issue that deeply concerns me, except for the environmental consequences of stuffing sealed toxic capsules below ground in a country where millions are dependent on wells tapping the ground water.</p> <p>However in the public interest I approached the <a href=\"http://www.fea.org/\">Funeral Ethics Association</a> whose Lisa Carlson advised pre-needers not to bother, \"unless you are reducing assets to the level to get Medicare\". Better to plan ahead she said, while her organisation also advocates cheaper, greener, DIY burials - where the law allows.</p> <p>The death industry in the United States has lobbyists almost as tenacious as Wall Street's in Washington. Embalming, morticians, concrete vaults and all sorts of expensive ghoulish accoutrements are compulsory in different states. Carlson herself is being <a href=\"http://www.katesboylston.com/NewsPage.aspx?newsID=1427\">sued</a> by Thomas Lynch, author and poet of the mortuary slab for comments she has made about the industry and his business.</p> <p>Ms Carlson does not say so, of course, but if you are not worried about funeral costs, those who are about to die can happily run up huge credit card charges and leave them swinging for the bailiffs to try to shake down the urn afterwards. Now that is real pre-need planning. But do be careful. My father tried it, and paid an insurance premium on his Visa card. They noticed and came a-knocking.</p>",
  "<p>The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act introduced by Labour eight years ago aimed to outlaw political donations from foreigners. </p> <p>Donations to political parties can only be made by individuals who are on the electoral register or UK companies that are registered, incorporated in the European Union and are trading in the UK. </p> <p>Parties also have to declare loans from companies and individuals and cannot accept loans from foreigners.</p> <p>All donations and loans over \u00a35,000 to the central party and \u00a31,000 to a constituency association must be disclosed. </p> <p>These rules are enforced by the Electoral Commission, whose compliance officers check the electoral register to see that the people have the right to vote. </p> <p>It is not enough for the donor to be a British citizen: they have to be registered on the electoral roll. When they are not, the commission can and has ordered the forfeiture of the donation.</p> <p>Any donation accepted by the Conservatives from Russian oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, would be illegal and forfeited. The regulations say the party must satisfy itself that any donation is legitimate. It has to return the donation if it breaks the rules. Failure to do so could lead to a fine and imprisonment for a year for the person accepting the donation. Accepting a loan from a foreigner is also a criminal offence.</p> <p>The law says that it is illegal for companies to be used as a front or agent for a foreigner to channel money to a party. It is the responsibility of the party to check this. But it is difficult to prove and a law now passing through Parliament will give the commission the power to require that a company donating to political parties disclose how it obtained the cash.</p>",

The offer was not taken up.</p> <p>\"For clarity: the Conservative party has neither sought or received any donations from Mr Deripaska nor any of his companies.\"</p> <p>Mandelson has condemned as \"muck-raking\" criticism of him for accepting hospitality from wealthy individuals such as Deripaska while EU trade commissioner.</p> <p>Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards on public life, said the allegation about the Tory party was \"potentially a serious matter\" but would probably come to nothing.</p> <p>\"It is a serious matter if they are seeking to attract donations from people outside of the United Kingdom who are not on the electoral register and, and this is the key allegation, exploring ways of getting round the UK legislation by channelling it through a UK company,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.</p> <p>\"That is potentially a serious matter but, as always, there's no hard facts. I should be surprised, as there was no donation in the end, whether the Electoral Commission investigates - and they don't have a very strong track record of producing good quality evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges.</p> <p>\"I suspect it will fizzle out.\"</p> <p>Sir Alistair did, however, warn that such social relations with rich businessmen could damage the political system.</p> <p>Politicians had to deal with senior figures to gain an understanding of the sector and seek ideas about the policies that would best serve the economy, he said.</p> <p>\"But it is slightly more questionable, these issues of accepting hospitality during your summer breaks and what have you from these sort of people.</p> <p>\"These can create either an obligation or a perception that you are getting very close to this which, in due course, can seem to possibly have an impact on your policy decisions or a perception that your policy decisions were influenced by those conversations and that is damaging to the whole political system.\"</p>",
  "<p>They are possibly the most despised financiers in America. But the nation's mortgage bankers, widely blamed for playing a central role in the global financial meltdown, are in no mood to be humble.</p> <p>Thumping rock music, a glittering lilac backdrop and vast US flags decorated the stage at this week's annual convention of the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). The comedian Jay Leno, a quartet of Beatles impersonators and the former presidential adviser Karl Rove were on hand to lift the battered industry's spirits.</p> <p>\"We're all still here and we're still standing,\" declared Kieran Quinn, outgoing chairman of the association, who took the floor to a pounding chorus of Coldplay's Viva La Vida. He arrived shortly after a colour guard in full military regalia hoisted a US flag while an opera singer belted out The Star-Spangled Banner.</p> <p>A uniform sea of grey suits, the thousand or so bankers at San Francisco's Moscone conference centre inhabit ground zero in this year's global economic crisis. President Bush, the treasury secretary Henry Paulson and the Federal Reserve's chairman Ben Bernanke, have all cited lax standards by mortgage lenders as key to the financial paralysis which has spread from Wall Street to Europe and beyond.</p> <p>Billions of dollars worth of sub-prime mortgages were written at the height of America's property boom. These loans, never realistic, are deeply in default, leaving Wall Street with vast liabilities. More than two million Americans have lost their properties to repossession.</p> <p>\"Everybody believed that house prices would just keep rising,\" Quinn admitted to his members. \"We, and everyone else, had unprecedented confidence that it was a golden age of finance. We thought we had solved everything - no more recessions, no more inflation.\"</p> <p>In a normal year, nobody would take much notice of a wonkish gathering of homeloan originators. But a noisy group of protestors were on hand to remind the mortgage bankers of their unpopularity. Campaigners outside the conference centre wielded placards reading \"grand theft bailout\" and \"jail greedy bankers - let them rot\".</p> <p>Despite tight security, one protestor made it into the hall and climbed onto the stage to deliver a speech \"on behalf of the public\", interrupting a talk about debt leverage by the chief executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But before the activist could make her case for a freeze in foreclosures, she was hauled away by security guards.</p> <p>Bill Hackwell of Answer, a protest coalition involved in the demonstration, said: \"We wanted to make sure they didn't think it was going to be business as usual as they meet to work out how to cover themselves.\"</p> <p>Critics say the mortgage industry got drunk on its own success. Unscrupulous lenders pushed inappropriate mortgages on customers who could never afford to repay them. The MBA's own figures show that 9.1% of mortgages on US family homes are in arrears - the highest figure since records started 39 years ago.</p> <p>Among delegates, though, the mood was philosophical. Groups of mortgage bankers stood around, swapping stories and exchanging business cards. Some were willing to admit that their industry had made mistakes - but they argued that customers, regulators, the government and Wall Street were all complicit.</p> <p>Jim Kunzler, president of an Indiana lender, 1st Source Bank, blamed \"investor greed, some bad acting in the lending community and many uninformed borrowers\" for the financial crisis.</p> <p>\"There's certainly no lack of blame to be shared around the entire global economy,\" he said. \"To say one industry is responsible for all this is a little simplistic.\"</p> <p>His view was echoed by Ted Eric May, managing partner of law firm Sheldon May which specialises in servicing the mortgage industry: \"Politicians and the general public are looking for easy people to blame. All of us are to blame. Our society has gone from living within our means to borrowing without restraint.\"</p> <p>Yet inside the conference's exhibition hall, specialists spoke of a reckless culture in which lenders failed to make even basic checks on borrowers' income. Phillip McCall, a mortgage fraud investigator, cited a case of a warehouse worker who applied for a mortgage, claiming an income of $7,500 per month: \"Basic common sense is going to tell you someone in a warehouse is not going to be earnings $90,000.\"</p> <p>Only since the credit crunch has bitten have mortgage firms begun to crack down on such fraud. McCall says his firm, Imarc, has seen its workload leap from four or five mortgage investigations per month to several thousand.</p> <p>The MBA itself has not been immune. The association's membership has shrunk by more than 17%. The Washington Post reported recently that the organisation had struggled to find tenants for its $100m new 12-storey headquarters building in the US capital.</p> <p>John Courson, the MBA's chief operating officer, closed his own firm, Central Pacific Mortgage, because of \"cashflow\" issues last year. He told the Guardian that the industry was being unfairly tarred - and that lenders' initiatives to keep customers in their homes have staved off 2.3 million more foreclosures.</p> <p>\"I don't think the American public is upset with the mortgage banking industry,\" he said, reeling off a list of programmes to aid struggling borrowers under the banner of Hope Now - an alliance between the US government and the mortgage industry aimed at helping homeowners. \"Our industry has responded responsibly in terms of loss mitigation.\"<br>As delegates drifted out of the hall clutching complimentary Freddie Mac document bags, there was a general sense of embattled defiance. </p> <p>William Quick, a Seattle mortgage banker, blamed a few bad apples for his industry's loss of reputation and deflected responsibility: \"Nobody could have predicted that house values could have stopped increasing as they did or fallen as precipitously as they did.\"</p> <p>Sipping a drink as a guitarist played gentle melodies in the conference's foyer, Cary Burch, the chief executive of mortgage software provider LSSI, said mortgage lending was a force for good: \"I'm proud to be part of this industry. It's been great to help people achieve their home-ownership dreams.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is the time to reform <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods</a>: to recreate a new international architecture for global finance. I have read what Jeffrey Sachs has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">had to say</a> on this: I would not disagree with him, and yet there is much to add.</p> <p>First, we have to recognise that there is considerable regulation of the financial services sector in place, much of it introduced over the last few years. Perversely, some of those who claim to be most compliant with that regulation are in fact some of the most abusive tax havens in the world. There is an important lesson to learn from that simple observation: much of the regulation we have is applied to the wrong people, in the wrong place, asks the wrong questions, and fails to identify the risk that the regulation is meant to control. As a result, the most important thing we must do now is undertake a very rapid gap analysis of the existing regulatory structure of the world's financial system. We must resist the temptation to better regulate what is unimportant and instead regulate the difficult things we have so far ignored.</p> <p>By far the most important issues that will arise relate to tax havens, or secrecy jurisdictions as I prefer to call them. These are the international financial system's \"get out of regulation free card\". In the past international corporations have faced down regulation by suggesting any attempt to impose it is contrary to international competitive pressure, largely promoted by tax havens as part of an international regulatory race to the bottom. We have to change that. If we do not then there is no prospect of any other regulatory reform being successful. </p> <p>This reform can be done. We must demand that all abusive tax havens place on public record details of the beneficial ownership of all companies that operate within their domain, put the accounts of all companies on public record, and do the same for trusts. And of course we must lead the way by doing this ourselves. Then we will have created the information that is needed to operate a market on a level playing field. And we must impose sanctions on those countries that do not cooperate, which could be simply done by deducting tax at source from all payments made to those places that did not put this information on record. Barrack Obama is already proposing that in the USA. </p> <p>Next, we have to ensure that we know which companies are doing what activity where. This might sound a simple objective but the current accounting systems of the world make it almost impossible to find this out. Consolidated accounts are in practice little better than a work of fiction when it comes to finding out what happens within a multinational company because all the transactions between companies within the group are removed from view in those accounts. It is, however, those intra-group transactions that are used to undermine regulation, to avoid tax by relocating profit, and to hide assets from international regulators who might have reason to know about them. </p> <p>We do, therefore, urgently need reform of international accounting standards so that every multinational company is required to report its transactions on a country-by-country basis so that we know where it makes its sales, and how much is to genuine third-party customers and how much is intragroup; where it makes its profit; where it pays its tax and where it locates its assets. Again, without this most basic information no amount of regulation will work because we will have no way of locating the trades we are trying to regulate and will have no yardstick to measure success.</p> <p>Finally, in this very short list of additional recommendations, there needs to be radical reform of the world's auditing systems. It is very clear that the Big Four firms of auditors completely failed to appraise the risk inherent within the financial structures of their major audit clients and issue appropriate risk warnings \u2013 as is their duty. This is unsurprising; they have been principal architects of the world's offshore finance system. They all operate in all the world's major tax havens. This has created a fundamental conflict of interest within their core structure which cannot be addressed unless they are forced to split their auditing activities from all their other commercial roles. If this is not possible new state labour auditing systems have to be created.</p> <p>So let us move forward with haste, but start from the basic issues that need to be addressed if we are to succeed in achieving an effective regulatory regime.</p>",
  "<p>The US environmental movement is failing \u2013 by any measure, the state of the earth has never been more dire. What's needed, a leading environmentalist writes, is a new, inclusive green politics that challenges basic assumptions about consumerism and unlimited growth.</p> <p>All of us who have been part of the environmental movement in the United States must now face up to a deeply troubling paradox: Our environmental organizations have grown in strength and sophistication, but the environment has continued to go downhill, to the point that the prospect of a ruined planet is now very real. How could this have happened?</p> <p>Before addressing this question and what can be done to correct it, two points must be made. First, one shudders to think what the world would look like today without the efforts of environmental groups and their hard-won victories in recent decades. However serious our environmental challenges, they would be much more so had not these people taken a stand in countless ways. And second, despite their limitations, the approaches of modern-day environmentalism remain essential: Right now, they are the tools readily at hand with which to address many pressing problems, including global warming and climate disruption. Despite the critique of American environmentalism that follows, these points remain valid.</p> <h2>Lost ground</h2> <p>The need for appraisal would not be so urgent if environmental conditions were not so dire. The mounting threats point to an emerging environmental tragedy of unprecedented proportions.</p> <p>Half the world's tropical and temperate forests are now gone. The rate of deforestation in the tropics continues at about an acre a second, and has for decades. Half the planet's wetlands are gone. An estimated 90 percent of the large predator fish are gone, and 75 percent of marine fisheries are now overfished or fished to capacity. Almost half of the corals are gone or are seriously threatened. Species are disappearing at rates about 1,000 times faster than normal. The planet has not seen such a spasm of extinction in 65 million years, since the dinosaurs disappeared. Desertification claims a Nebraska-sized area of productive capacity each year globally. Persistent toxic chemicals can now be found by the dozens in essentially each and every one of us.</p> <p>The earth's stratospheric ozone layer was severely depleted before its loss was discovered. Human activities have pushed atmospheric carbon dioxide up by more than a third and have started in earnest the most dangerous change of all \u2014 planetary warming and climate disruption. Everywhere, earth's ice fields are melting. Industrial processes are fixing nitrogen, making it biologically active, at a rate equal to nature's; one result is the development of hundreds of documented dead zones in the oceans due to overfertilization. Freshwater withdrawals are now over half of accessible runoff, and water shortages are multiplying here and abroad.</p> <p>The United States, of course, is deeply complicit in these global trends, including our responsibility for about 30 percent of the carbon dioxide added thus far to the atmosphere. But even within the United States itself, four decades of environmental effort have not stemmed the tide of environmental decline. The country is losing 6,000 acres of open space every day, and 100,000 acres of wetlands every year. About a third of U.S. plant and animal species are threatened with extinction. Half of U.S. lakes and a third of its rivers still fail to meet the standards that by law should have been met by 1983. And we have done little to curb our wasteful energy habits or our huge population growth.</p> <p>Here is one measure of the problem: All we have to do to destroy the planet's climate and biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to keep doing exactly what we are doing today, with no growth in human population or the world economy. Just continue to generate greenhouse gases at current rates, just continue to impoverish ecosystems and release toxic chemicals at current rates, and the world in the latter part of this century won't be fit to live in. But human activities are not holding at current levels \u2013 they are accelerating, dramatically.</p> <p>The size of the world economy has more than quadrupled since 1960 and is projected to quadruple again by mid-century. It took all of human history to grow the $7 trillion world economy of 1950. We now grow by that amount in a decade.</p> <p>The escalating processes of climate disruption, biotic impoverishment, and toxification, which continue despite decades of warnings and earnest effort, constitute a severe indictment of the system of political economy in which we live and work. The pillars of today's capitalism, as they are now constituted, work together to produce an economic and political reality that is highly destructive environmentally. </p> <p>Powerful corporate interests whose overriding objective is to grow by generating profit (including profit from avoiding the environmental costs their companies create, amassing deep subsidies and benefits from government, and continued deployment of technologies originally designed with little or no regard for the environment); markets that systematically fail to recognize environmental costs unless corrected by government; government that is subservient to corporate interests and the growth imperative; rampant consumerism spurred by sophisticated advertising and marketing; economic activity now so large in scale that its impacts alter the fundamental biophysical operations of the planet \u2014 all combine to deliver an ever-growing world economy that is undermining the ability of the earth to sustain life.</p> <h2>Are environmentalists to blame?</h2> <p>In assigning responsibility for environmental failure, there are many places to lay blame: the rise of the modern, anti-government right in American politics; a negligent media; the deadening complexity of today's environmental issues and programs, to mention the most notable. But a number of observers have placed much of the blame for failure on the leading environmental organizations themselves.</p> <p>For example, Mark Dowie in his 1995 book Losing Ground notes that the national environmental organizations crafted an agenda and pursued a strategy based on the civil authority and good faith of the federal government. \"Therein,\" he believes, \"lies the inherent weakness and vulnerability of the environmental movement. Civil authority and good faith regarding the environment have proven to be chimeras in Washington.\" Dowie argues that the national environmental groups also \"misread and underestimate[d] the fury of their antagonists.\"</p> <p>The mainstream environmental organizations were challenged again in 2004 in the now-famous The Death of Environmentalism. In it, Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus write that America's mainstream environmentalists are not \"articulating a vision of the future commensurate with the magnitude of the crisis. Instead they are promoting technical policy fixes like pollution controls and higher vehicle mileage standards \u2014 proposals that provide neither the popular inspiration nor the political alliances the community needs to deal with the problem.\" </p> <p>Shellenberger and Nordhaus believe environmentalists don't recognize that they are in a culture war \u2014 a war over core values and a vision for the future.</p> <p>These criticisms and others stem from the fundamental decision of today's environmentalism to work within the system. This core decision grew out of the successes of the environmental community in the 1970s, which seemed to confirm the correctness of that approach. Our failure to execute a dramatic mid-course correction when circumstances changed can be seen in hindsight as a major blunder.</p> <p>Here is what I mean by working within the system. When today's environmentalism recognizes a problem, it believes it can solve that problem by calling public attention to it, framing policy and program responses for government and industry, lobbying for those actions, and litigating for their enforcement. It believes in the efficacy of environmental advocacy and government action. It believes that good-faith compliance with the law will be the norm, and that corporations can be made to behave and will increasingly weave environmental objectives into their business strategies.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism tends to be pragmatic and incrementalist \u2014 its actions are aimed at solving problems and often doing so one at a time. It is more comfortable proposing innovative policy solutions than framing inspirational messages. These characteristics are closely allied to a tendency to deal with effects rather than underlying causes. Most of our major environmental laws and treaties, for example, address the resulting environmental ills much more than their causes. In the end, environmentalism accepts compromises as part of the process. It takes what it can get.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism also believes that problems can be solved at acceptable economic costs \u2014 and often with net economic benefit \u2014 without significant lifestyle changes or threats to economic growth. It will not hesitate to strike out at an environmentally damaging facility or development, but it sees itself, on balance, as a positive economic force.</p> <p>Environmentalists see solutions coming largely from within the environmental sector. They may worry about the flaws in and corruption of our politics, for example, but that is not their professional concern. That's what Common Cause or other groups do. Similarly, environmentalists know that the prices for many things need to be higher, and they are aware that environmentally honest prices would create a huge burden on the half of American families that just get by. But universal health care and other government action needed to address America's gaping economic injustices are not seen as part of the environmental agenda.</p> <p>Today's environmentalism is also not focused strongly on political activity or organizing a grassroots movement. Electoral politics and mobilizing a green political movement have played second fiddle to lobbying, litigating, and working with government agencies and corporations.</p> <p>A central precept, in short, is that the system can be made to work for the environment. In this frame of action, scant attention is paid to the corporate dominance of economic and political life, to transcending our growth fetish, to promoting major lifestyle changes and challenging the materialistic values that dominate our society, to addressing the constraints on environmental action stemming from America's vast social insecurity and hobbled democracy, to framing a new American story, or to building a new environmental politics.</p> <p>Not everything, of course, fits within these patterns. There have been exceptions from the start, and recent trends reflect a broadening in approaches. Greenpeace has certainly worked outside the system, the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club have had a sustained political presence, groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund have developed effective networks of activists around the country, the World Resources Institute has augmented its policy work with on-the-ground sustainable development projects, and environmental justice concerns and the emerging climate crisis have spurred the proliferation of grassroots efforts, student organizing, and community and state initiatives.</p> <p>But organizations that were built to litigate and lobby for environmental causes or to do sophisticated policy studies are not necessarily the best ones to mobilize a grassroots movement or build a force for electoral politics or motivate the public with social marketing campaigns. These things need to be done, and to get them done it may be necessary to launch new organizations and initiatives with special strengths in these areas.</p> <p>The methods and style of today's environmentalism are not wrongheaded, just far, far too restricted as an overall approach. The problem has been the absence of a huge, complementary investment of time, energy, and money in other, deeper approaches to change. And here, the leading environmental organizations must be faulted for not doing nearly enough to ensure these investments were made.</p> <p>America has run a 40-year experiment on whether this mainstream environmentalism can succeed, and the results are now in. The full burden of managing accumulating environmental threats has fallen to the environmental community, both those in government and outside. But that burden is too great. The system of modern capitalism as it operates today will continue to grow in size and complexity and will generate ever-larger environmental consequences, outstripping efforts to cope with them. Indeed, the system will seek to undermine those efforts and constrain them within narrow limits. Working only within the system will, in the end, not succeed \u2014 what is needed is transformative change in the system itself.</p> <h2>Environmental protection requires a new politics</h2> <p>This new politics must, first of all, ensure that environmental concern and advocacy extend to the full range of relevant issues. The environmental agenda should expand to embrace a profound challenge to consumerism and commercialism and the lifestyles they offer, a healthy skepticism of growthmania and a redefinition of what society should be striving to grow, a challenge to corporate dominance and a redefinition of the corporation and its goals, a commitment to deep change in both the functioning and the reach of the market, and a powerful assault on the anthropocentric and contempocentric values that currently dominate.</p> <p>Environmentalists must also join with social progressives in addressing the crisis of inequality now unraveling America's social fabric and undermining its democracy. It is a crisis of soaring executive pay, huge incomes, and increasingly concentrated wealth for a small minority, occurring simultaneously with poverty near a 30-year high, stagnant wages despite rising productivity, declining social mobility and opportunity, record levels of people without health insurance, failing schools, increased job insecurity, swelling jails, shrinking safety nets, and the longest work hours among the rich countries. In an America with such vast social insecurity, economic arguments, even misleading ones, will routinely trump environmental goals.</p> <p>Similarly, environmentalists must join with those seeking to reform politics and strengthen democracy. What we are seeing in the United States is the emergence of a vicious circle: income disparities and influence to wealthy constituencies and large businesses, which further imperils the potential of the democratic process to act to correct the growing income disparities. Corporations have been the principal economic actors for a long time; now they are the principal political actors as well. Neither environment nor society fares well under corporatocracy. Environmentalists need to embrace public financing of elections, regulation of lobbying, nonpartisan Congressional redistricting, and other political reform measures as core to their agenda. Today's politics will never deliver environmental sustainability.</p> <p>The current financial crisis and, at this writing, the response to it, reveal a system of political economy that is profoundly committed to profits and growth and profoundly indifferent to people and society. This system is at least as indifferent to its impacts on nature. Left uncorrected, it is inherently ruthless and rapacious, and it is up to citizens, acting mainly through government, to inject values of fairness and sustainability into the system. But this effort commonly fails because progressive politics are too enfeebled and Washington is increasingly in the hands of powerful corporate interests and concentrations of great wealth. The best hope for real change in America is a fusion of those concerned about environment, social justice, and strong democracy into one powerful progressive force.</p> <p>The new environmentalism must work with this progressive coalition to build a mighty force in electoral politics. This will require major efforts at grassroots organizing; strengthening groups working at the state and community levels; and developing motivational messages and appeals \u2014 indeed, writing a new American story, as Bill Moyers has urged. Our environmental discourse has thus far been dominated by lawyers, scientists, and economists. Now, we need to hear a lot more from the poets, preachers, philosophers, and psychologists.</p> <p><em>James Gustave Speth is author of The Bridge at the End of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability and dean of the Yale University School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies.

  "<p>There could be no clearer warning about the database state than the one given last night by Sir Ken Macdonald QC, the outgoing Director of Public Prosecutions. \"We need,\" <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7680704.stm\">he said</a>, \"to understand that it is in the nature of state power that decisions taken in the next few months and years about how the state may use these powers, and to what extent, are likely to be irreversible.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They will be with us forever.

There is almost no area of our lives to which she and her anonymous officials are not laying claim. </p> <p>The truth is that we have already gone some distance to building this nightmare state. At the moment the <a href=\"http://www.ips.gov.uk/identity/index.asp\">Home Office</a> has <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/managingborders/technology/eborders/\">plans</a> to take 19 pieces of information from each us every time we travel abroad \u2013 including credit card details, mobile phone numbers and itineraries. Nearly 50 pieces of information will be required by the National Identity Register, to say nothing of the constant monitoring of our behaviour entailed in ID verification. All journeys on motorways and through town centres are to be recorded by police <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_number_plate_recognition\">number plate recognition</a> cameras: the information will be retained for two years. On top of all this, Smith now plans a <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/home-office-in-revolt-at-smiths-plan-for-big-brother-database-966919.html\">vast communications silo</a> at GCHQ, Cheltenham, which will record the details of all phone calls, emails and Internet connections.</p> <p>Last week she <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7674775.stm\">called for</a> a national consultation characterised by openness and reason. Sir Ken has kicked off the debate with the strongest possible challenge to her, and it is time for the rest of the political establishment to start imagining the world that is being conceived and built in the darkest corners of the state. </p> <p>Sir Ken, by all accounts a very good DPP, has often found himself at odds with the authoritarian note struck by New Labour. In speeches he has attacked both the notion of the \"war on terror\", and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/23/terrorism.uksecurity\">42 days</a> detention without charge. </p> <p>Last night, he used his valedictory message to remind us that in 2004, when he took office, the prime minister and the then home secretary (David Blunkett) \"suggested publicly, and on the same day, that in serious crime cases the criminal standard of proof should be lowered.\" Sir Ken pointed out that this conflicted with Britain's obligations under the Human Rights Act to provide for fair trials, as well as our common law norms. He said that to have accepted this view would have meant \"sending men and women to prison for many years \u2013 in the face of reasonable doubts about their guilt.\"</p> <p>Unlike Blair and Blunkett, the DPP understood and obeyed the Rule of Law. Now that he asks us to imagine what life in Britain will be like in ten, or 15 years time, we should pay attention and engage the sinister forces of control in our country. It is, as he implies, our last chance.</p>",
  "<p>No issue in California's Proposition 8 campaign has generated as much debate as the contention by supporters that public schools in the state will promote same-sex marriage if the ballot measure fails.</p> <p>The Yes on 8 forces have made it the focus of their campaign strategy in television and radio adverts that have been running for weeks. The ads point to Massachusetts, where gay marriage has been legal since 2003 and the issue is being taught in schools.</p> <p>But opponents of the proposed constitutional amendment, which would end gay marriage in California, accuse supporters of fear-mongering. They note there is nothing in the state education code that requires schools to teach anything about marriage - straight or gay.</p> <p>On Monday, the Yes on 8 campaign brought a Massachusetts couple featured in its new $2m ad buy to Sacramento and launched a statewide bus tour from the Riverside Wesleyan Church in the Sacramento area.</p> <p>Robin and Robb Wirthlin recounted how a year after Massachusetts legalised gay marriage, they were shocked when their 7-year-old son told them he was read the King and King, a book that included two princes marrying.</p> <p>After the Mormon couple objected to having their children taught about same-sex marriage, the US First Circuit court of appeals ruled they had no right to advance notice of the instruction. Two weeks ago, the US supreme court refused to hear an appeal of their case.</p> <p>\"This is now the law of the land in the First Circuit federal court and it will be used in California against Californians to say this is the legal reason why we cannot object to teachings about gay marriage,\" Robin Wirthlin said at a news conference.</p> <p>But Kate Kendall, an attorney for the No on 8 campaign, said \"the claim that if Prop 8 passes, children will be taught about gay marriage is a lie\". The Wirthlin case, she said, was decided on Massachusetts law.</p> <p>\"We have broad 'opt-out' provisions,\" Kendall said, allowing parents in California to remove their children from class before something they deem objectionable is taught.</p> <p>California state and local education officials also say the Yes on 8 adverts are misleading.</p> <p>The state education code, they note, barely mentions marriage. </p> <p>When it does, it refers to teaching \"respect for marriage and committed relationships\" in generic terms and \"the legal and financial aspects and responsibilities of marriage and parenthood\".</p> <p>Instruction and materials may not \"reflect or promote bias against any person\" on the basis of several categories, including sexual orientation.</p> <p>But marriage instruction is not required because California is \"a local control state\" and the decision is left to school districts.</p> <p>Moreover, state law requires schools to inform parents before sex or other sensitive issues are discussed.</p> <p>\"The ed code is crystal clear and that's not being reported in the ads,\" said Sharla Smith, the sexual health expert at the California department of education.</p> <p>Patti Kelly, a spokeswoman for the California School Boards Association, said Proposition 8 will not \"impact public education\".</p> <p>The Yes on 8 campaign contends California education law requires teachers to instruct children as young as kindergarten about marriage.</p> <p>But the law doesn't require any instruction about marriage, and Smith said even schools that teach about marriage in general, don't do so until high school. State law also does not require schools to teach comprehensive sex education, but they must provide HIV/Aids prevention education at least once in middle school and once in high school.</p> <p>Ema Gluckmann, a science teacher at West Campus High School in Sacramento, wrote the original curriculum for health instruction for the Sacramento City Unified school district. \"When kids [bring] up gay marriage or straight marriage or living together - whatever - I say that everybody deserves to be respected,\" Gluckmann said.<br></p>",
  "<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/21/health-health1\">today's Guardian</a>, Harriet Harman is planning to quash the free Commons votes tomorrow on liberalising Britain's abortion laws. Doing so would be an outrageous betrayal of those who supported her successful Labour deputy leadership campaign. </p> <p>The specific measures proposed include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/northernireland-women\">legalising abortion in Northern Ireland</a>, revoking the rule that demands that two doctors are required to authorise any abortion, and allowing nurses to prescribe early-stage medical terminations (conducted through taking drugs rather than through surgical procedure). </p> <p>Rumour has it that Harman, the leader of the Commons, will either table a motion preventing amendments on abortion or that an unofficial whip will tip certain MPs to \"filibuster\" or talk out the time for the bill, so that it goes to a vote before the abortion amendments are reached. </p> <p>But the government agrees with these measures, and Harman and Dawn Primarolo built their careers on the equalities agenda for women \u2013 so why would they betray women now? The whispers from Westminster suggest that the government view is that it is \"not the right time\", right now. Not because of the economic situation, not because of public opinion, but because we are nearing the date of the Glenrothes byelection. </p> <p>From a Labour perspective, this is outrageous, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/health-health\">as Polly Toynbee argues</a> in today's Guardian. For a Labour government to stifle the best chance in a generation to reform abortion law would be an unforgivable betrayal, and a political stupidity. </p> <p>Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that the government supported and facilitated a free vote on the reform of abortion. There is every possibility that we would go into the Glenrothes byelection with the pro-choice movement having won that vote. Yes, it's true that some people would want to punish Labour for that. But if the SNP and Conservatives ran a hysterical campaign on abortion while we are leading on the economy \u2013 and with a strong local candidate \u2013 it is clear that the opposition would be marginalising themselves with this issue. </p> <p>The worst-case scenario is that Labour loses in Glenrothes, and in the unlikely circumstances that it is because of this issue. Even then, Labour would still have delivered a better, more accessible, less bureaucratic service to women on the mainland and have enabled reform in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>We should be taking these steps with pride. It is acceptable for Labour MPs with personal concerns to vote against these measures if they feel they must. But I would want to see any Labour MP who used a filibustering mechanism to prevent it being debated face a deselection procedure in their own constituency. Any minister or whip who tipped a wink to a backbencher suggesting a filibuster was OK \u2013 I would want to see them sacked. And any political adviser suggesting to No 10 that the Glenrothes byelection result will be improved by making the prime minister look weak on an issue at the heart of our ideology? That person is a fool. </p> <p>Last year, Harriet Harman won the deputy leadership of the Labour party with a call to support her as a woman. She did so with credibility because of the way she has driven the equalities agenda throughout her career. But having used that agenda to take her to the most powerful position she has ever enjoyed, it will be the most cynical betrayal if she prevents a vote on these measures tomorrow. </p> <p>Labour politicians should not achieve power so it can perpetuate their careers. Labour politicians are there to use their power for the good of the country and its people. Does this generation of Labour politicians have the progressive vision that can lead Britain for another 10 years or has it run out of ideas, motivated by short-term opinion poll deviations? I won't know until I see what their position is on this bill.</p>",
  "<p>Sidewalks and streets at Ground Zero were, at least temporarily, free of illegal vendors and hawkers on Monday afternoon after city officials demanded a crackdown on the selling of September 11 memorabilia, knockoff designer handbags and watches.</p> <p>\"You can't hawk at Ground Zero. It's distasteful and it's illegal,\" said Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer. \"It gives Ground Zero a carnival atmosphere. It's inappropriate, especially for the families that go there to pay their respects.\"</p> <p>Scores of September 11 hawkers have become a mainstay at Ground Zero. They flash photographs of exploding debris and images of the twin towers crumbling in the faces of tourists and passersby at the Liberty Street New York fire department firehouse, and in front of the Tribute Centre, the official World Trade Centre museum.</p> <p>Some hawkers even sell the pictures at the fence where tourists gather to view the site by a Port Authority sign saying it is \"prohibited\" for vendors to sell there. The sign asks tourists to \"refrain\" from buying items. It also suggests tourists buy their collectibles at the Tribute Centre gift shop, which \"offers authorised commemorative WTC items.\"</p> <p>Proceeds are donated to the September 11th Families Association.<br>Church Street was also empty of vendors and their tables where they usually sell glass figurines of the World Trade Centre, T-shirts and hats. In front of the Century 21 department store no one was selling the usual knockoff designer bags, watches and sunglasses to the throngs of tourists thus easing pedestrian traffic.</p> <p>Still, a handful of illegal vendors returned later to Ground Zero, quietly selling on the corner of Vesey and Church streets -- discreetly approaching tourists with 9/11 photographs. They were back also at Liberty Street, hawking next to the firehouse and fence.</p> <p>\"The police move us and give us tickets,\" said one photo vendor who did not want to give his name. \"I've been doing this for two months, and it puts food on the table for my family.\" He said he knows some people are offended, \"but the tourists are really interested. They want to know what happened here,\" he said in Spanish.</p> <p>The New York Port Authority and police department have been ticketing illegal vendors since 2005, said Steven Coleman, port authority spokesman.<br>Elizabeth Berger, president of the Alliance of Downtown New York, said illegal vending on Liberty and Church streets is \"a public safety issue. It's crowded with hundreds of thousands of people. There is construction, and illegal vending frankly violates the sanctity of the site.\"</p> <p>Police commissioner Ray Kelly said police have repeatedly arrested illegal vendors at the World Trade Centre site only to have them return after paying nominal fines. Kelly pointed out, however, that police can't keep track of multiple offenders because, by law, they can't usually fingerprint vendors since they are charged with violating the city's administrative code, not the state penal law. That means prosecutors and judges can't keep track of which are recidivists and therefore subject to steeper fines.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown or Nicolas Sarkozy: who saved Europe and the world with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">coordinated plan to rescue toxic banks</a> and reform the global financial system with Bretton Woods 2? Pervenche Ber\u00e8s, chairwoman of the European parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee, is in no doubt: it's Gordon, stupid.</p> <p>\"He's the only one of the EU's 27 leaders who understood the global system and what the crisis meant,\" she tells me as she guides me to the lifts in the parliament's colossal HQ. \"Most of the rest of them hadn't a clue.\"</p> <p>But this compact French socialist, scourge for years of neo-liberals and the powerful deregulation lobby, a hate figure even within the financial community, is assuming a wider and more influential role herself as the turmoil unfolds.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, as guest of honour at the City of London's annual reception here, she laid into those liberal shibboleths and was loudly applauded \u2014 not least because her English is nigh-impeccable, her sense of humour profoundly attractive and her views both pertinent and trenchant.</p> <p>A week later, she led the first-ever delegation of MEPs to the IMF/World Bank annual meetings in Washington. This week, in Strasbourg, she fronted the assault on the dilatory approach of the European commission to regulation.</p> <p>Ber\u00e8s voted, three years ago, against the new EU constitution but is an unrepentant proponent of harmonised EU regulation of financial services (a single rule book) and of the need to enforce it through a single supervisor. \"It was my idea but I was defeated on it in the parliament here,\" she says, insisting it will come back (despite Brown's resistance).</p> <p>A new high-level EU group on supervising cross-border banks in Europe has been set up under Jacques de Larosiere, ex-IMF managing director, and Ber\u00e8s thinks it will reinvent the idea. The head of the IMF's European department, Alessandro Leipold, endorsed it this week. \"We hope the financial crisis will be an opportunity to cross some political red lines,\" Leipold said.</p> <p>Ber\u00e8s is scathing about the EC's \"timid\" approach of sticking to the virtually unknown system of having committees of 27 banking supervisors and slightly beefing them up into \"colleges\". \"Where was the committee of European banking supervisors (CEBS) when the problems at Fortis and Dexia erupted? Did they see anything coming?\"</p> <p>At the very least she's likely to see a supervisory group modelled on the lines of the ECB governing council with its \"hub and spoke\" structure. Oh, and by the way, she told the City that truly effective EU crisis management means the UK, with its principal wholesale financial market, joining the euro. That brought a few muffled groans into champagne flutes.</p> <p>The EC, led by Jos\u00e8 Manuel Barroso, she adds, was way behind the curve in reacting to the financial crisis and surrendered its right of initiative to Brown, Sarko and the rest: the cards in the pack have been permanently reshuffled in favour of governments and of MEPs, with their co-decision rights.<br>Handing me a sheaf of reports by leading MEPs calling for stricter regulation of financial services, warning of pending implosion and dating as far back as 2002, she is fiercely critical of Charlie McCreevy, the internal market commissioner and ultra-reluctant regulator.</p> <p>\"MEPs called for legislation to regulate credit rating agencies in the spring of 2004 and he said no. Then, in September last year, he named and shamed the agencies. Now, more than a year later, we still don't have a proposal,\" she says.</p> <p>McCreevy still sees no reason to regulate hedge funds and private equity firms: Sarko and Barroso have overruled him, with support from the parliament. Ber\u00e8s is among those pushing him to come up with plans to curb banking bonuses and abolish tax havens for banks bailed out in the current crisis.</p> <p>She's now bracing herself for the financial services lobby to again bring out its big guns against McCreevy's half-hearted plans for a revised capital requirements directive \u2014 just as they have over his delayed plans to regulate the rating agencies. This would oblige banks to retain 5% - not 10% or 15% \u2014 of the securitised products they \"originate and distribute\".</p> <p>\"I can hear the mobilisation of the banking world to explain to us why this is a terrible idea,\" she said to the parliament this week. She told me recently: \"I may be mad to say this but this is the truth: the lobbying started in July, even before the crisis broke. It's the same old bloody argument: if you go down this road, there'll be a flight of capital and we'll move away too. But I've never see them pack up and go.</p> <p>\"Their idea is that instead of being obliged to retain 5%, 10% or 15%, they should report to CEBS and be transparent about their transactions.\" She laughs with derision. But, even with more MEPs singing from the same hymn sheet, she knows the financial lobby can wield a clumping big stick.</p> <p>Ber\u00e8s matters more because, in the arcane world of EU decision-making and even with the Lisbon treaty giving more powers to MEPs in limbo because of the Irish 'no' vote, the parliament increasingly has the final say on legislation.</p> <p>And she, like others, will be negotiating down to the wire with the EC and governments, including the country holding the presidency, on the tortuous compromises that will shape the final package of legislation. The new world regulatory order that may emerge from the current turmoil will, in part, be designed by her and her colleagues.</p>",

  "<p>The murder of aid worker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/afghanistan-internationalaidanddevelopment\">Gayle Williams</a> is an atrocious act. The fact that it has been justified on religious grounds is an abomination. As a Muslim I feel ashamed that such a barbarity has been perpetrated in the name of Islam.<br> Williams, who worked for the Christian charity <a href=\"http://www.serveafghanistan.org/\">Serve</a>, was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle as she walked to her office in Kabul. For over two decades, motorcycle assassinations have been a regular feature of the Afghani and Pakistani landscape. And the murderers have, more often than not, turned out to be religious fanatics. The responsibility for this particular shooting was readily claimed by the Taliban.<br> Williams was killed simply for being a Christian. \"Our leaders issued a decree to kill this woman\", said a Taliban spokesman, because she \"came to Afghanistan to teach Christianity\". The fact that \"this woman\" was a woman was also clearly held against her. As such, her cold-blooded murder was legitimate and had religious sanction in the mental universe that the Taliban inhabit.</p> <p>Who and what are the Taliban? The majority of their members are young students groomed in seminaries that operated in Pakistan during the Soviet occupation and hard-fought Afghan guerrilla war. The seminaries, financed by Saudi dollars, expounded a particular interpretation and approach to Islam \u2013 the totality of dogma as necessary detail, prescriptive dos and don'ts. The objective of the Taliban is to institute an Islamic utopia in Muslim Afghanistan. Like all utopias, religious or secular, it is a restrictive, totalitarian, nightmarish vision.</p> <p>This vision of Islam, like any utopian project, must clear away imperfections, the unacceptable, the intolerable, the distracting, and create ground zero, the purified territory on which, alone, true righteousness can exist. The fact that Islam has existed in Afghanistan for over a thousand years does not make it Islamic in the eyes of the Taliban. To become truly Islamic, Afghanistan has to be forced to return to an idealised history when Islamic time began and all was perfect. Nothing can be allowed to stand against this endeavour. And all actions, however murderous and criminal, are justified in the pursuit of this goal.</p> <p>This is why the Taliban hate everything that does not fit their criteria for being Islamic. They execute women who do not cover their hair without a qualm. They behead those who do not support an Islamic beard, which should sprawl unconfined and not be neat and trim. So far this year, they have killed 29 aid workers for simply being foreigners, Christians, or different.</p> <p>Every act, however barbaric and evil, is celebrated and seen as a step forward towards their ultimate goal. The Taliban see themselves as heroes, engaged in a life and death struggle to recreate an imagined Medina in the time of the Prophet Muhammad. Their disaffection with everything that exists today is zealous to the minutest detail. Oh, and it is certain, unquestioningly certain of the rectitude of all its answers to any and all problems. <br> That is why Gayle Williams will not be the last innocent person to be brutally killed simply for being different or for serving humanity. There will be many more as long as the Taliban exist. For the Taliban have no notion of humanity, nor do they subscribe to anything that can be remotely described as humane. Such a notion of Islam can only be condemned, in the strongest terms possible, by all people of faith. Muslims need to do much more than simply distance themselves from the inhumanity of the Taliban. We need to take positive steps to do something about this evil.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> La Crescenta, Los Angeles. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Kenan Bell (raps), Jason Burkhart (beats), Jon Siebels (production). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> What do Sting, Tom Bailey of garish 80s pop-dance trio the Thompson Twins, and new LA rapper Kenan Bell have in common? Not a lot, as it turns out. But they are all former schoolteachers. In fact, the 25-year-old Bell, who recently toured Europe with Dizzee Rascal, still is one, spending his days at a private school in Montrose where he teaches something called Language Arts to 4th, 5th and 6th grade kids. Next question: what do MGMT, Morrissey and Kraftwerk have in common? They are all Bell's friends on his MySpace. There's a good reason for this. He has remixed MGMT's Weekend Wars and created a track, titled Save Your Life, based on samples from the Smiths' eerily beautiful account of an abortion, This Night Has Opened My Eyes. We're not sure about the Kraftwerk connection, but we're looking forward to Bell's version of Morgenspaziergang. <br> If you're already thinking Bell is not like most rappers, there's something else that sets him apart from his peers. He hates hip-hop, and he loathes the idea that he might be seen as a rapper. \"I used to pray, like, 'Please, lord, don't let me end up as a rapper,'\" he has said. This perhaps explains his insistence on keeping his day job and treating recording and performing as extracurricular, after-hours activities. His distaste for most hip-hop of the last 20 years \u2013 since the so-called Golden Age of Hip-Hop, ie that period between the chart hegemony of Run DMC, Beastie Boys et al and the release of De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising and Public Enemy's Fear of a Black Planet \u2013 and desire to distance himself from the hip-hop hordes also probably explain his use of rock samples, and the references to Jim Morrison in his lyrics.  Growing up in the suburbs of LA, his friends included goths, skate-punks, indie kids and ravers. On his MySpace the labels he attaches to his music are \"shoegaze\" and \"emotronic\". He counts his students and their parents as his biggest fans. \"I've sold more albums to my students than anyone else,\" he says. Not that he's some sort of Sesame Street hip-hopper rapping his way through the alphabet while balancing a multi-coloured puppet on his knee. On the title track of his debut EP, Good Day, he raps about sex, decadence, miscegenation, sexual and racial equality and the impending 2008 presidential elections over grinding, distorted guitars, and even though there's a message/moral halfway through - \"nothing in this world comes without a consequence\" \u2013 the track actually sounds more powerful than preachy. On Save Your Life he doesn't flinch from the realities of AIDS and abortion, while on Celebrity he pillories label addicts, druggies and delinquent pop tarts who think babies are fashion accessories. It's downbeat and occasionally discordant, but it's good stuff.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Kenan Bell's nerd-chic appearance, easy-like-Saturday-morning delivery, and smoothly blended samples make for the kind of hip hop gone missing since the early '90s.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> There's something oddly appealing about this rapper who hates rappers and has a track called Enjoy on which he sounds thoroughly depressed. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Turn up late for lessons after a long night spearing the vain and vacuous. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Use an overhead projector. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The Good Day EP is released on November 17 by Cutlass, followed by the debut album, provisionally titled Sounds Awesome, in early 2009. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> KRS-One, A Tribe Called Quest, Mos Def, De La Soul. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/theblackkenanbell\">www.myspace.com/theblackkenanbell</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> The Tough Alliance. </p>",

  "<p>Today's newspapers are full of stories of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-patyfunding\">politicians, glamorous yachts and rich foreign businessmen</a>. The story is that Andrew Feldman (the Conservatives' top fundraiser) and shadow chancellor George Osborne raised the possibility of Oleg Deripaska (one of Russia's richest men) donating \u00a350,000 to the Conservative party while they were staying on his yacht. This is hotly denied by the Conservatives.</p> <p>This has raised eyebrows, because since 2001 it has been illegal for people who are not on the UK electoral register to give donations to political parties. End of story? Well, not quite \u2013 the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (<a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/party-finance/legislation/legislation-on-political-parties\">PPERA</a>) which governs donations to political parties allows donations to come from a number of sources, one of which is \"a UK registered company which is incorporated within the European Union and carries on business in the UK\".</p> <p>Now I don't know if Oleg Deripaska owns any UK registered companies, which do business in the UK, but if he did it would be perfectly legal for one of them to make a donation. So if this alleged conversation did happen then it could have been perfectly legal, if politically embarrassing \u2013 as long as it was held with the owner of a UK-registered and trading company. </p> <p>This area of the law has already caused its fair share of scandal. Just before the 2005 general election, the Liberal Democrats received \u00a32.4m from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/22/uk.partyfunding\">Michael Brown</a> via a UK company, 5th Avenue Partners Ltd. Michael Brown, though a UK citizen, was not eligible to donate as he was not on the electoral roll, so he gave via his UK company. To this day questions remain about whether the donation was legal, as 5th Avenue Partners Ltd was only set up months before the donation. The difficulty lies in the definition of \"carrying on business in the UK\". Does it mean that a company which operates in the UK and has a turnover of, say, \u00a3100,000 a year can give a political party a donation of \u00a3500,000 by transferring money from a foreign company or subsidiary? This would certainly be against the spirit of the law but is most likely not illegal. </p> <p>There have been similar reports that the Tory vice-chair Lord Ashcroft <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4749181.ece\">channelled money</a> from his Belize-based companies into his UK-based ones, and ultimately on to the Conservative party.</p> <p>As it happens, politicians have an opportunity to revisit the law in this area. Yesterday the political parties and elections bill had its second reading. Ultimately the only way to completely clean up donations is to restrict them to those who are actually entitled to vote and to cap them so that politicians spend less time on glamorous yachts and more time seeking the support of ordinary voters.</p>",
  "<p>The sadly defunct <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/may/09/features11.g2\">pass notes column</a> in G2 often used to end with a \"least likely to say\" quote. Competition for the most improbable expression from the new business secretary Peter Mandelson is intense, but \"the rights of women and families at work are central to the new Labour project\" would be up there with them. The newly ennobled Lord Mandelson was never in touch with the sensitive side of old Labour, and \u2013 let's not exaggerate \u2013 wildly unsympathetic to the party's feminist wing. </p> <p>No surprise then that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/mandelson-economy\">an early victim</a> in his mission to ease the regulatory burden on business struggling with the economic downturn, is the commitment to extend flexible working. There are two reasons why he should think harder.</p> <p>The first, as Katherine Rake of Fawcett <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/20/workandcareers-worklifebalance\">argued yesterday</a>, is that policies that support families at work are not only good for individuals and their families, but for their employers too. That's why according to the professionals' house magazine <a href=\"http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/05/19/45891/\">Personnel Today</a> so many large-scale employers of women, like high street banks and supermarkets, support them. On some estimates, the economic impact of increasing the number of women in the workplace could be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/12/gender.equality\">as much as \u00a323bn</a>. </p> <p>Surely not something to be sniffed at in today's torrid climate.</p> <p>The danger of the reported thinking-out-loud is that it reinforces the negative. Business, collectively, dislikes anything that impinges on their freedom of action, and employment law is near the top of the list. Particularly in the context of women and families. <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/ndbs/press.nsf/0363c1f07c6ca12a8025671c00381cc7/46e649b760e9eaf880257348003e4274?OpenDocument\">The CBI is loud</a> in its criticism of any further legislation. It has a point: it does place an administrative burden on employers. </p> <p>But so does, say, health and safety policy. No one is suggesting that should be abandoned for the duration. One of Labour's triumphs over the past 10 years has been to transform the prospects at work for mothers and carers and increasingly (well, a bit) for men. According to the <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/ndbs/press.nsf/0363c1f07c6ca12a8025671c00381cc7/46e649b760e9eaf880257348003e4274?OpenDocument\">CBI's latest survey</a>, part-time work is now offered almost universally, job shares are widely available and nearly half of employers encourage working from home. </p> <p>So employers don't like being told what to do, but when it comes to the crunch they find they can do it. No doubt some Victorians thought the economy would never recover from the ban on sending children up chimneys. Pleasing business is a pretty thin excuse for irritating hundreds of thousands of Labour-voting women and men. </p> <p>But there is another, bigger, reason to reconsider. Mandelson's strongest selling point has always been his capacity for strategic thinking. It seems a reasonable guess to suppose that's why the prime minister has reinstalled him in the cabinet. And as any decent wartime leader recognises, the worse the times, the more important it is to keep hope alive. </p> <p>Preoccupied with staunching the hideous flows of financial disaster, there is too little evidence that anyone in Labour is giving coherent thought to explaining to the rest of us why we should stick with them. </p> <p>It's cheering that the chancellor is talking of front-loading public spending in the hope of pumping new life \u2013 er, some life \u2013 into the economy. But what we need to know is how this will feed into the post-recession world, the world where banks are regulated, obscene bonuses no longer paid and the tax-burden more equally shared (OK, I'm dreaming now). </p> <p>And it is not just lacking vision, it is self-defeating to admit at last that the state has a role in regulating City pay while simultaneously giving up the push to promote social justice for ordinary workers. Cynics might suggest this is not out of keeping with the traditional Mandelson approach to political priorities. But these are new times. As the great strategist will surely soon notice.</p>",
  "<p>I've just <a href=\"http://www.musicroom.com/se/ID_No/0448660/details.html\">written a book</a> about post-punk funk politicos <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/gangoffour\">Gang of Four</a>, and I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the band for making the job so easy. Because what could have been a dry, laborious dissection of serious Leftist dogma from a bunch of stuffy fiftysomething ideologues eager to re-examine the radical principles of their youth, turned out to be a melodrama so torrid it would make the Eastenders scriptwriters recoil and say, in best faux cock-er-nee, \"Do what? No way! Have a word! You made that up!\"</p> <p>I was expecting the writing of my biography of one of the most fiercely intelligent and politically credible bands of the last 30 years \u2013 \"The postgraduate Clash\", I think somebody once called them \u2013 to be heavy and hard-going and involve some seriously hard graft, and it was all of those things. I just wasn't expecting it to be so much, you know, fun. I assumed, from their reputation as rock's foremost intellectuals with impossibly high ideals \u2013 not to mention a close friendship with none-more-scholarly US rock writer <a href=\"http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/48307/greil_marcus_writing_about_rock_music.html\">Greil Marcus</a> \u2013 that I would have to turn up at interviews for the book with a copy of Das Kapital under one arm and proof of my membership of the Communist Party under the other. I was expecting them all to refer to each other as \"comrade\" or, at the very least, \"brother\".</p> <p>What I wasn't expecting was to arrive at the central London home of Andy Gill \u2013 described by one of his producers as \"the post-punk Hendrix\" \u2013 and watch him read out a recent email from another member of the band so full of rage towards the guitarist it was like a divorce petition penned by Charles Manson. I wasn't expecting to hear, during the course of my interviews with the four players, the word \"cunt\" to be deployed so freely when they referred to each other. I wasn't expecting bassist Dave Allen to dramatically quit the band mere months after telling me how glad he was to be back in the fold a quarter-century <a href=\"http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=10653\">after leaving the first time</a>. I certainly wasn't expecting to find out that Gill was a member by proxy of the celebrity aristocracy, having once been splashed over 10 pages of OK magazine in a photo extravaganza celebrating his marriage to <a href=\"http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_211248-OK-magazine-Michelle-Collins-cover-8-October-1999-Issue-182.html\">Angus Deayton's sister-in-law</a>, nor to discover that he is the godfather of Heavenly Hiraani Tiger, the daughter of the late Paula Yates and Michael Hutchence. And I really, really wasn't expecting to be told a story in which one band member tried to stick his tongue down another member's wife's throat during a meal that culminated in a massive brawl that started in a restaurant and ended on the pavement outside.</p> <p>I quite liked the idea of Gang of Four being above the usual petty squabbles and internecine warfare you get in most bands. Part of me was disappointed that they weren't imperious academics deconstructing the rock process with cold logic. I secretly wanted to feel awed by their detachment from mundane reality and the banality of everyday existence. Another part of me delighted in the fact that they were capable of such juvenile dementia, of having the sort of spats you'd have thought they'd have left behind at school, of being so, well, Liam and Noel.</p> <p>My next book is on Wire, a band so austere, grave and cerebral they do indeed make Gang of Four look like Oasis. I wonder how long it will be before the tales of fucking and fighting start to emerge there. And have you ever been disappointed \u2013 or delighted - to discover that a band weren't exactly as you'd imagined?</p>",

  "<p>Thailand's former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was today sentenced to two years' imprisonment in absentia over a corrupt land deal.</p> <p>In a ruling that made him the first Thai politician to be convicted of corruption committed while prime minister, Thaksin was found to have violated conflict of interest rules in helping his wife buy land from a state agency at a reduced price.</p> <p>The conviction was the first against Thaksin since he was ousted by a military coup in 2006, despite a raft of other corruption charges against him.</p> <p>But his wife, Pojaman, who jumped bail and fled to England with the former leader two monhs ago, was cleared of wrongdoing in the real estate deal. </p> <p>The split decision by Thailand's supreme court on a five-to-four majority verdict cleared Thaksin, 59, of more serious charges of abuse of power to obtain the land at a bargain price.</p> <p>\"Thaksin violated the article of the constitution on conflict of interest, as he was then prime minister and head of a government and was supposed to work for the benefit of the public,\" said one of the nine-judge panel reading the verdict.</p> <p>But the panel ruled seven-to-two to acquit Pojaman, 51, of all the charges in connection with the land purchase, though she has already been sentenced to three years jail for tax evasion in a separate case.</p> <p>Immediately after the verdict was announced Thaksin, the former owner and now honorary chairman of Manchester City Football Club, dismissed the ruling as politically motivated. \"I have been informed of the result,\" he told Reuters news agency. \"I had long anticipated it would turn out this way.\"</p> <p>After the verdict the prosecutors said they were preparing to file a formal extradition request with the UK to bring Thaksin back to Thailand to serve his sentence and face other corruption charges.</p> <p>The supreme court has also agreed to hear five other corruption cases against Thaksin and there five warrants out for his arrest following his flight in August.</p> <p>Today's case revolved around a 5.3 hectare piece of land that Pojaman bought from a state financial institution in 2003 for \u00a312.9m, just a third of its estimated value, two years after Thaksin became prime minister.</p> <p>The judges said that Thaksin had violated Thailand's corruption laws by allowing his wife to take part in the bidding process for the land.</p> <p>Hundreds of diehard supporters of the former prime minister gathered outside the court as the decision was being read.</p> <p>The conviction against former prime minister is unlikely to alleviate the political turmoil that has left the government - led by Thaksin's brother-in-law, Somchai Wongsawat - under siege from protesters for months.</p> <p>The demonstrators, who have occupied the grounds of Government House and forced Somchai to run the country from a disused airport, accuse him of being a puppet of Thaksin and are demanding he quit over deadly force used against them by police.</p>",
  "<p>India and Pakistan opened a trade route across divided Kashmir for the first time in six decades today, another step in lowering temperatures between the nuclear-armed neighbours.</p> <p>From Indian Kashmir came fruit, nuts and honey while Pakistani Kashmiri traders sent rice and rock salt. Security was tight for the opening, with even the fruit subject to stringent security checks.</p> <p>Hundreds gathered on both sides of the de facto border - symbolising the yearning for a solution to the bitter dispute which has led to three wars.</p> <p>Lorries are expected to drive a few kilometres inside rival territory and unload. \"It is a big leap forward,\" said Mubeen Shah, the president of India's Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"We will be sending 11 truck load of goods across the line of control.\"</p> <p>The lorries will take the same route as the bus service connecting Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, and Muzaffarabad, that capital of Pakistani Kashmir. Transporting people has been largely unsuccessful - not least because of the suffocating bureaucracy. Only 9,000 passengers have used the service since 2005.</p> <p>The trade, limited to one day a week, is an attempt to bring a peace dividend to the Himalayan region that in recent months has seen an upsurge in anti-Indian rioting and heavy firing between Indian and Pakistani troops.</p> <p>India has been reluctant in recent years to open its Kashmiri border, saying that it would simply receive an influx of Islamic militants from Pakistan. Indian Kashmir has been scarred by a violent insurgency since 1989 and peace is kept by the presence of hundreds of thousands of soldiers.</p> <p>The violence has fallen sharply since the nuclear-armed states began a peace process in 2004 aimed at settling all outstanding issues including the future of Kashmir, which they both claim in full.</p> <p>However the new administration in Pakistan has surprised many in India with its emphasis on building trust through trade. Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari, told the Wall Street Journal this month he wanted to see Pakistani-stitched jeans and Pakistani cement sold in India. \"There is no other economic survival for nations like us. We have to trade with our neighborus first,\" he said.</p> <p>With an eye on Delhi's security concerns, Zardari went further than any of his predecessors to state that militants were \"mujahideen or terrorists who do not operate under the command of a [Pakistani] general ... [they are] wolf packs hunting on their own\".</p> <p>Despite a flurry of denials, the Wall Street Journal's own recording of the interview shows clearly that Pakistani president used the word \"terrorists\" to describe militants. He also surprised Delhi by saying India had \"never been a threat\" to Pakistan.</p> <p>The interview raised eyebrows in Delhi, which has accused Pakistan in recent months of playing a dangerous double game - talking peace while sending over bombers. \"Does the [Pakistani] army endorse its civilian commander-in-chief's India policy?\" asked Vinod Sharma of the Hindustan Times.</p>",

  "<p>Until recently, oligarch was a byword for Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC. </p> <p>But over the last 12 months, Oleg Deripaska, a 40-year-old metals tycoon, has dominated the headlines. </p> <p>According to Forbes magazine, in May he overtook Abramovich as Russia's richest man, with a $28.6bn (\u00a316.8bn) fortune. </p> <p>His extraordinary wealth is based on the ownership of the world's leading aluminium company.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian last year, he shrugged off the suggestion he was very well off. Asked how much he was worth, he replied: \"I don't know.\" Recently, he has been a high-profile victim of the credit crisis.</p> <p>Deripaska's friendship with British politicians has placed him at the centre of controversy. He has met the business secretary, Peter Mandelson, when Mandelson was the EU's trade commissioner. </p> <p>Moscow's Pushkin cafe, an elite pre-revolutionary restaurant favoured by Russia's elite, was one dinner venue.</p> <p>Also present, according to a political blog written by Mandelson's former special adviser Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, was Nathaniel Rothschild, a friend not only of Mandelson but of the shadow chancellor, George Osborne. </p> <p>According to today's Times newspaper, Rothschild says Deripaska entertained Osborne on his yacht in Corfu last summer. </p> <p>Andrew Feldman, the Tory party's chief fundraiser, was there. Feldman tried to solicit a \u00a350,000 donation for the Tories from Deripaska, it is alleged, though this is denied.</p> <p>Deripaska had his multi-entry visa revoked by the US in mid-2006. He has been involved in legal cases in the US, and in Britain a former business partner, Michael Cherney, is suing him in the high court.</p> <p>The cases date back the 90s. It was then, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that a new class of businessmen - the oligarchs - ruthlessly carved up the country's newly privatised state industries. </p> <p>Deripaska was involved in the struggle for control of an aluminium plant in Sayanogorsk, Siberia, which became part of privatisation legend, described as the \"aluminium wars\". </p> <p>He dismisses claims that at one point his enemies tried to blow him up on a mountain road using a grenade launcher.</p> <p>Like many super-wealthy Russians, Deripaska is an Anglophile. He has a \u00a320m house in Belgravia and speaks fluent idiomatic English, learned when he studied at Moscow state university. his young son and daughter have mastered the language, thanks to their English nanny.</p> <p>He has business interests in the UK: in 2006 his investment company, Basic Element, bought the ailing British van-maker LDV.</p> <p>Deripaska has no plans to live in Britain, and has denied rumours he was at one point interested in buying Arsenal. \"It's not my thing,\" he said of football last year.</p> <p>Like many oligarchs, he came from humble origins, growing up in a small rural village in southern Russia with his widowed mother, an engineer. </p> <p>By 1993-94, he had accumulated a 20% stake in a Siberian aluminium factory. </p> <p>In 2000, Abramovich bought most of the holdings in Russia's aluminium industry and merged them with Deripaska's company. They created Rusal - Russian aluminium. Abramovich later sold his stake to Deripaska, leaving him the biggest player in one of the world's most lucrative industries.</p> <p>Deripaska has shown an uncanny knack for cultivating the rich, powerful and important. He is well connected inside Russia: in 2001 he married Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin's powerful chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, who is married to the late president's younger daughter, Tatyana. </p> <p>Deripaska is very close to Vladimir Putin, Russia's powerful prime minister.</p> <p>What is unclear is why Deripaska would want to cultivate the Tories - even assuming that they will form the next government. </p> <p>In his Guardian interview, Deripaska made it clear that Britain was of little strategic interest to him. His global empire, he explained, was based on smelters, hydro-electric dams and cheap Siberian power. \"I'm dealing with industrial things, and Britain is a post-industrial economy,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>Death row inmates in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nigeria\">Nigeria</a> are witnessing the executions of fellow prisoners and being forced to clean their gallows, Amnesty International told guardian.co.uk today.</p> <p>Hundreds of people on death row could be innocent because of the lack of fair trials in the country, said Aster van Kregten, Amnesty's researcher in Nigeria. She said appeals were often abandoned due to lost case files and the country's criminal justice system was \"riddled with corruption, negligence and a nearly criminal lack of resources\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338828533\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/21/nigeria220.jpg\" alt=\" A worker bends to enter the notorious island jail of Ita Oko, Nigeria\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker enters the island jail of Ita Oko, Nigeria.

It's really critical - the risk of executing innocent people could run into the hundreds.</p> <p>\"If nothing is done, more and more people will be sentenced to death. It's an irreversible decision. It's not just the sentence - some have been awaiting trial for capital sentences for 10 years. It's very bad. Prisoners are suffering mental trauma and fear. Some say they are forced to clean gallows and have witnessed executions.\"</p> <p>In February, 752 men and 11 women were on death row in Nigeria. About half of them were convicted murderers, while most of the rest had been convicted of armed robbery or robbery. At least 40 were under 18 at the time of their conviction.</p> <p>In a report co-authored with the Legal Defence and Assistance Project (Ledap), a Nigerian legal organisation that assists prisoners with NGO funding, Amnesty said children as young as 13 had been sentenced to death, breaking international law. The report urges the Nigerian government to impose an immediate moratorium on all executions based on its findings.</p> <p>Among the list of abuses the organisation says it has uncovered is confessions obtained under torture. Although such evidence is not admissable in court, Amnesty says the judiciary is turning a blind eye to abuses by police. It says the majority of those on death row were sentenced based on confessions alone. </p> <p>Chino Obiagwu, Ledap's national coordinator, said: \"Under Nigerian law, if a suspect confesses under pressure, threat or torture, it cannot be used as evidence in court. Judges know that there is widespread torture by the police and yet they continue to sentence suspects to death based on these confessions, leading to many possibly innocent people being sentenced to death.\"</p> <p>Almost 80% of Nigerian prisoners said they had been beaten, threatened with weapons or tortured in police cells, according to the report, which accuses the police of indiscriminately arresting people - including witnesses - to try and keep up with high crime rates.</p> <p>Van Kregten said police brutality and corruption were common experiences, with police often asking for money for fuel in exchange for visiting witnesses or checking alibis.</p> <p>\"The police are overstretched and under-resourced. Because of this, they rely heavily on confessions ... rather than on expensive investigations. Convictions based on such confessions are obviously very unsafe.\"</p> <p>Nigeria has long been dogged by corruption that the president, Umaru Yar'Adua, has vowed to tackle. Amnesty said the corruption in the criminal justice system meant preferential treatment was given to those who could pay to get on pardon lists.</p> <p>\"The hundreds of people who have already been executed or are still awaiting execution in Nigeria all have one thing in common: they are poor,\" Obiagwu said. \"Speaking to those languishing on death row, it becomes clear that questions of guilt and innocence are almost irrelevant in Nigeria's criminal justice system. </p> <p>\"It is all about if you can afford to pay to keep yourself out of the system, whether that means paying the police to adequately investigate your case, paying for a lawyer to defend you or paying to have your name put on a list of those eligible for pardon. Those with the fewest resources are at the greatest risk.\"</p> <p>The Nigerian government has not officially reported any executions since 2002, although Amnesty said at least seven people were secretly executed in 2006. Six of them did not have the opportunity to appeal.</p> <p>The Nigerian embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone sweating his or her way through a nightshift may like to contemplate where the term \"graveyard shift\" comes from. Legend has it that the phrase originates from a time when medical sciences weren't so advanced, and there was a chance an unconscious person would be mistaken for a dead person and be buried alive. This became so common that the recently departed were buried with bells and undertakers were paid to sit in the graveyards at night and listen for a tinkling sound. Sadly, history doesn't tell us whether they got time-and-a-half for their troubles. </p> <p>More than one in five of us now work outside standard office hours. And while the graveyard shift no longer involves bells and coffins, if employees aren't careful it can still be have potentially unhealthy consequences. Research has linked nightworking to a number of ailments, from mild health problems through to forms of cancer. </p> <p>One particularly worrying link has been drawn between working at night and breast cancer. A Danish study involving more than 7,000 women showed those who had worked at night for at least six months had a 50% higher risk of developing the disease. </p> <p>Other studies have shown that the increased link between cancer and the nightshift can to a large extent be attributed to low levels of melatonin, a hormone that inhibits the growth of cancers and strengthens the immune system. In fact, the human body produces more melatonin during darkness hours - but artificial light disrupts this process, which is why nightshift workers are vulnerable.</p> <p>These studies are by no means conclusive - but plenty of other (albeit less serious) health-related concerns apply to nocturnal working. Karen Baxter, managing director of health and safety consultancy Sypol, which advises the NHS on nightshift working practices, says people often experience symptoms like fatigue, sleeplessness, disorientation, indigestion and heartburn as a result of working at night. \"In the longer-term people may develop gastrointestinal or cardiovascular problems,\" she adds. </p> <p>Although there is no specific legislation covering nightshift workers, plenty of guidance is available for employers. Normal health and safety obligations apply, such as the duty to carry out a risk assessment and apply health and safety measures for staff. \"Employers can also make sure the workload and staffing levels are appropriate, ensure there is enough variety in the work and try to avoid scheduling anything safety-critical on the nightshift,\" says Baxter. </p> <p>But it's not all bad news, according to the people who get up when the sun goes down. \"I love working the nightshift,\" says Rafik Djaker who, as a packer at Smiths News, helps distribute the nation's newspapers. \"I started working nights when I was at university. Now, with three children, it suits my life completely. I can see my family and do whatever I want during the day, and when I go to work I don't have to worry because my family is asleep. It's great.\" <br> According to Professor Gaby Badre, a sleep expert from The London Clinic, different factors contribute to a person's ability to thrive at night. \"Sleep is a very individual subject,\" he says. \"There are different types of sleepers - short sleepers, late sleepers and those who are phase-delayed - basically night owls. These people are more suited to working at night.\" Age is also a factor, he says. \"Our circadian clock changes as we age and it's a lot easier to cope when you are young. The most important factor though is whether you are working nights permanently, or if it is irregular - this is hardest to adapt to and where we find most of the problems.\" Tellingly, Djaker is a permanent nightshifter. Jude Vause-Walsh, on the other hand, can attest to the pain of irregular sleep patterns since she took over the night-time show on Century Radio, broadcasting between midnight and 6am Monday to Thursday. While that section of the week is nocturnal, at weekend she reverts to daytime living. \"During the week I just have to accept that I won't see my husband and that I can't really socialise with friends,\" says Vause-Walsh. \"It's just about doing the show, sleeping and looking forward to the weekend when I can get back to normal.\"  Even when nightshift workers don't have families to worry about, they can still find the experience all-consuming. \"We work four nightshifts in a row about every six weeks,\" says Dr Matt Erritty, a junior doctor at Queen Mary's Hospital. \"The first night is always a bit of a slog and getting out of the pattern can take a day or two. When you're working nights your life is basically sleep, work, eat, sleep, work, eat - it doesn't leave time for other things.\" Healthy eating can also go out of the window. \"Your diet always goes to pot,\" Errity says. \"It's junk food and sandwiches for three or four days and when you come out of the back of it, you feel desperate for a real meal. The problem is when you wake up in the evening and you think it's dinnertime, but your body is only ready for breakfast.\" In factories, of course, tiredness and machinery do not mix well. \"Early in the morning between one and three o'clock, the periodic nightshift worker should be careful not to doze,\" says Badre. \"Most accidents in factories occur at this time, when we start to come up from the deepest of our hibernation. That's why you are least alert and more prone to accidents.\"  Vause-Walsh also has her low points during the night. \"Four o'clock is when I hit the wall,\" she says. \"That's when I need caffeine and do star-jumps in the studio to keep myself going. We also know that's when our listeners are feeling it as well, so we play a real rock-out tune.\"</p> <p>There is, however, one thing Vause-Walsh loves about working nights: \"The commute is always really quiet!\" And with luck, the only muffled ringing of bells that nightshifters will ever hear are from the snooze settings of distant alarm clocks.</p>",
  "<p>Why is the politics of immigration such a mess?. Yesterday <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Woolas\">Phil Woolas</a>, Britain's new immigration minister, sat beside his Dutch opposite number and said that immigration policy needs a rigorous counting in and counting out of everyone who enters Britain. His Dutch colleague would have been bemused as it is impossible to count who enters and leaves the Netherlands because there are no longer any borders there. Even if Europe gave up on the free flow of people and tried to reintroduce stringent frontier controls it still would not work.</p> <p>When I worked in Geneva 25 years ago at a time when passports were checked at main borders there were still dozens of small roads going from France into Switzerland which had no permanent border checks on them. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement\">Schengen</a> \u2013 the system that allows Europeans to move about freely \u2013 was introduced not in a fit of Euroliberalism but because the system of trying to stop and examine the papers of every car, lorry, bike, or walker crossing the hundreds of thousands border roads of Europe had become impossible.Today most cars drive across Swiss border controls without any check.</p> <p>Britain actually was a forerunner with its mini-Schengen with Ireland. Even though Ireland is a sovereign republic with policy that over the decades has been at times inimical to Britain, no British politician \u2013 even during the worst of the IRA terror attacks \u2013 suggested imposing border control or passport checks on Irish citizens coming into Britain.</p> <p>Recently, the Lib Dems in South Yorkshire distributed a xenophobic newsletter attacking a Labour councillor of Danish origin who has lived in Britain for 24 years. The Lib-Dems described her as \"non-British\" in a cheap BNP-style dog whistle to local voters. Yesterday in the Commons, <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/\">UKIP</a>'s sole parliamentary representative, Bob Spink, wanted to know how many \"non-British\" people there are in the workforce. Tories fell in behind the UKIP man and shouted at ministers about the level of this new category of \"non-Brit\" who work here.</p> <p>The answer is that we cannot know unless we want to start counting every Irish, American, Australian, Canadian and other foreigner all the time. The queues at our airports are surely long enough as it is without insisting on another long line for everyone who catches a Ryanair or Easyjet holiday flight to be registered.</p> <p>There are 300,000 \"non-Brit\" sudents at our universities providing an economic lifeline to stretched university finance as well as creating new cohorts of young men and women who, one hopes, will appreciate their stay in Britain and become economic and political friends of Britain when they go home.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.zpwb.org.uk/en\">Federation of Poles</a> produced a dossier of Daily Mail headlines this year which described Poles in lurid, hostile, xenophobic language. Migration Watch constantly attacks foreigners in Britain. Yet now the Poles are going home fast. The easiest way to cut immigration is to have a recession.</p> <p>Britain has 24,000 foreign-owned firms according to a parliamentary answer I recently received. I would like to see that figure go up and when I am abroad at economic conferences I promise foreign investors they will be welcome in South Yorkshire despite Lib Dem and BNP xenophobia.</p> <p>But if all the language from top Tories is about limiting the presence of foreigners in Britain and ministers echo that refrain, why on earth should anyone come to a country where the media-political discourse is so hostile?</p> <p>Britain's economic comparative advantage under Blair and Brown is that we are the most internationally open of EU nation states. We create new barriers and type-cast \"non-Brits\" as the unwelcome other at our peril.</p> <p>After the Russia's invasion and dismemberment of Georgia, David Cameron said he wanted to punish Russian businessmen visiting Britain with heavy new visa restrictions. Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-partyfunding\">today's news</a> about the Tories and the oligarchs, Mr Cameron may regret his comments. But as a strong critic of Russian geo-political bullying I welcome the presence of 150,000 Russians in Britain adding and spending wealth in our country. The dispute with Russia is with the neo-authoritarian Kremlin. The wider and deeper the Russian economy grows the better and while Mr Cameron today has questions to answer about George Osborne and Russian billionaires Britain should not seek to punish Russian economic actors.</p> <p>If I believed there were easy measures that would reduce asylum seeker backlogs, send back the economic migrants who abuse the asylum rules, or reduce tensions when my constituents hear languages they cannot understand, practices they do not share, or ways of life they cannot understand, I would embrace them.</p> <p>In the 1930s, the Daily Mail described Britain as an over-crowded island which should prevent German Jews from emigrating here. Then our population was 30 million. Today it is twice that but still only 10% of UK land surface has dwellings on it. And with a bigger population we have become richer and freer. </p> <p>The Tory idea of a population limit is not far off Canute telling the tide not to come in. We have raised the age at which people can marry. Our brothels and massage parlours pullulate with teenage girls trafficked into Britain to satisfy ever-increasing demand for paid-for sex. But we cannot marry a non-EU citizen until he or she is over 21. Again, as with English language lessons (as if the 800,000 Brits in Spain were expected to speak Spanish) I have no objections but these are surface scratching measures.</p> <p>Britain has to be open for business, for ideas, for people. The immigration debate as defined by the Tories, the Daily Mail, Migration Watch and the BNP is about shutting down Britain.</p>",
  "<p>When white knight of the art house David Gordon Green took on this summer's stoner comedy Pineapple Express, many wondered what the George Washington director was doing dabbling in the mainstream.</p> <p>The answer, it would appear, was setting himself up to make comic-book movie adaptations: Green's next project will be a <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i9e2284979c0b8c782f723c65d816185e\">big screen version of the graphic novel Freaks of the Heartland</a>, about a rural, middle-American town where grotesquely malformed offspring face danger from their own parents, according to the Hollywood Reporter.</p> <p>Original writer Steve Niles is executive producing the horror film. <a href=\"http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/12-747/Freaks-of-the-Heartland-1\">His 2004 graphic novel</a> was published by Dark Horse comics, whose stable also includes Sin City and Hellboy. Niles also wrote 30 Days of Night, the vampire-themed graphic novel which was the subject of a recent big screen adaptation starring Josh Hartnett.</p> <p>Green isn't writing Freaks of the Heartland: that job goes to first-time screenwriters Peter Sattler and Geoff Davey. Before Pineapple Express the film-maker had at least a hand in penning all four of his previous features, but would now seem to be making a career for himself as something of a gun for hire.</p>",
  "<p>To restore stability to the global financial system (and therefore to trade and the ecosystem) we need a \"great transformation\" to reverse the most pernicious elements of the failed \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/globalisation\">globalisation</a>\" experiment. Three pillars are vital to any new international architecture. They are: </p> <p><strong>\u0095 The taming of financial markets</strong> \u2013 through the re-introduction of capital controls; restraints in the growth of credit; and the establishment of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/wallstreet.marketturmoil\">Keynesian</a> international clearing agency;</p> <p><strong>\u0095 \"Upsizing\" the state</strong> \u2013 empowering governments to respond to democratic mandates by wresting power over decision-making from unaccountable financial markets, and restoring policy autonomy to elected governments; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 \"Downsizing\" the single global market</strong> \u2013 by introducing an international trading system based on the concept of \"appropriate scale\". </p> <p>Since Nixon unilaterally dismantled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">Bretton Woods</a> in 1971 and defaulted on the US government's commitment to meet its obligations in gold; and since the introduction of legislation to liberalise credit creation, financial markets have been liberated from social, political, and environmental constraints. As a result the world was turned upside down. The finance sector no longer acted as servant to the economy, but instead became its master. The tail wagged the dog. </p> <p>To <a href=\"http://www.debtonation.org\">restore stability</a>, and to restore powers over economic decision-making to elected governments, it will be essential to reinstate and coordinate capital controls across borders. (Capital controls involve restraints on capital, and are different from exchange controls, restraints on the availability of foreign or local currency.) This can be done through a multilateral body such as the IMF and is not entirely new thinking. The control of capital movements remains a central mandate of the IMF, as outlined in Article 6, Section 3: \"Members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movements.\" </p> <p>Second, we must urgently revive Keynes's conception of an independent central bank \u2013 the international clearing agency (ICA). Third, we need an international currency to be used only for trading purposes, and not speculation \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor\">bancor</a>. </p> <p>Keynes's ICA placed an obligation on countries to achieve balance in trade. Globalisation has generated massive destabilising surpluses in countries like China, and deficits in countries like the US and the UK. </p> <p>The ICA would hold the reserve assets of governments centrally to constitute a mix of currencies, weighted by the volume of trade with each country. This means that the US would no longer act as the world's banker. Loans to the US (treasury bills) would no longer serve as the main reserve currency. These low-cost loans fuelled US consumption and the US deficit, and were financed in large part by countries with millions of poor, like China and India. The ICA would also act as an international \"lender of last resort\" and would serve to reduce the volume of speculative flows between countries. </p> <p>Reversing globalisation means that states must be \"upsized\" \u2013 they must act to regain political autonomy. This means clawing back the power given away by legislators and central bankers to unaccountable players in international capital markets. Elected governments must instead respond to electoral mandates and pursue democratic agendas. To do so, they must manage currencies, interest rates, and external balances \u2013 all vital levers in stabilising an economy. They must have freedom to tax and spend and so meet democratically determined priorities. They must be freed to introduce environmental and social standards and regulations that promote social and economic justice and sustain the life support systems of the planet. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the utopian project of a single global market needs to be dismantled. For the purposes of sustainability \u2013 economic and environmental \u2013 production, distribution, and consumption need to take place at the \"appropriate scale\". This could mean a move towards \"localisation\" \u2013 keeping production and consumption within an appropriate area, such as a country or sub-region; or it could mean promoting trade and investment within and between regions, in order to ensure fairer competition and reduce transport costs while maintaining some of the advantages of scale. While, inevitably some goods and services will be traded internationally, the bulk could be traded locally and regionally. </p> <p>A system of \"appropriate scale\" takes into account the environmental costs of trade. Free trade was given a free ride by the global environment. That is no longer sustainable. Governments must be free to pursue the trade policies most appropriate to their climate, economy, and stage of development. </p> <p>Such a great transformation is vital if we are to end the dictatorship of haute finance and once more protect the interests of society as a whole, and the ecosystem.</p>",
  "<p>I am still recovering from the inane parade of rubbish that was the Q Awards. The magazine always has been, and always will be, a remarkable feat of tedium. But they have surpassed their own banality with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/awardsandprizes\">awards</a> - it is a dreary music industry office-party, built on the bland, celebrating the bland, and espousing Q's very own brand of the bland.</p> <p>Alan Carr hosted the ceremony - a funny guy who died a death on stage. But he is blameless in this atrocity exhibition of the bored. It must have been a tough gig, hosting a bash full of people about to lose their jobs.</p> <p>What is the point of the Q Awards? Is it that we need them to point out the collective genius of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay\">Coldplay</a>, Keane and, er, Coldplay? </p> <p>The question my mind is never going to be \"who will win?\" but which failed man-child from the retirement home for journalists took time off from compiling their list of favourite Midge Ure synth-solos to produce an award show of such tedium?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/2008/10/coldplay_pulled_off_a_double.html\">Best Act in the ENTIRE WHOLE WIDE WORLD was ... Coldplay</a>. What does that even mean? Did Q do a comprehensive survey of everyone in the world? Were Q Agents despatched to pinpoint the worldview? If the award went by sales, then the Best Act in the Entire Whole Wide World would be High School Musical or the Josh Groban Christmas album (but neither were nominated). </p> <p>So, in Q World (a dull place full of accountants and estate agents) the biggest band in the world are Coldplay: music for grown-up teenage emos, who, when not crying and writing bad poetry about sad colours, are giving a few pounds to Amnesty International charity workers, because that is what Chris Martin would do (weeping bitter tears for the world as he did so). Of course, Coldplay went onto win best album and why not? We are in Q World now.</p> <p>You need suspense in an awards show, you need to keep the punters guessing, you need people on the edge of their seats. You need to not give all the awards to Coldplay.</p> <p>But hang on, they didn't. Q built the suspense to a Hitchcockian pitch by giving the Best Track award to ... <em>Keane</em>. For Spiralling. A track that was given out as a free download; a track that over 500,000 people downloaded, decided was rubbish and when released as a paid-for download, lingered at 23 in the charts before disappearing again.</p> <p>This celebration of musical mediocrity must have been Q's get-well card to their very own Pete Doherty - Tom \"Posho\" Chaplin. A man valiantly fighting his well-publicised port addiction, which pushed him over the edge into cancelling a tour, fighting his demons and revealing Keane's new metamorphosis on Perfect Symmetry - a horrific transformation into Midge Ure-meets-late-period-OMD.</p> <p>But it makes sense to award best new track to Keane. The kids in Q World are down with Midge Ure. Remember, over at Q, there are many magnificent lists to be compiled about Midge Ure's career and Keane's Perfect Symmetry will give them fodder for so many more!</p> <p>Now that you are acclimatised to Q world, let's check out the Q Classic Songwriter, Q Icon, and Q Inspiration awards (also known as <a href=\"http://www2.qawards.co.uk/2008/winners/\">the Acts Publicising Their New Albums on Jools Holland At the Behest of Major Labels awards</a>): Step forward John Mellencamp, winner of the Q Classic Songwriter Award and winner of the Q Legend Award, Glen Campbell. Both fresh from taping Jools Holland and guaranteed shows for the office party.</p> <p>The WTF moment came courtesy of the winners of the Q Inspiration award - Cocteau Twins. I love the Cocteau Twins dearly, but Q would never feature a <em>band influenced by the Cocteau Twins</em> in their bland little musical diary. Best New Act went to the Last Shadow Puppets. Again, I love the act, but giving \"best new act\" to a side project, in a year of some great debuts? This is not encouraging for new music.</p> <p>If depression, blandness, and boredom would ever manifest itself in physical form, it would be the Q Awards. Someone actually said \"there are no losers tonight, only people full of win!\". No, there is one big loser: music. The Q Awards are the meaningless musical equivalent of Homer Simpson \"winning\" the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_Can_You_Spare_Two_Dimes%3F\">First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/15/france-football-raymonddomenech-pauldoyle\">keep Raymond Domenech as France coach</a> ended up as a minor footnote to the main talking-point on last week's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH07nXXTMEQ\">news programmes</a> and chat-shows: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw487rMP_w8\">to boo or not to boo</a> the national anthem. Nicolas Sarkozy's fantastically impractical solution to abandon any match minutes before kick-off if an anthem is jeered completely overshadowed the <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20081015_114227_raymond-domenech-confirme_Dev.html\">Domenech saga</a>. But if the France coach can thank one man for saving his job, it wouldn't be the FA chief <a href=\"http://www.ladepeche.fr/content/photo/biz/2008/04/03/200804031943_zoom.jpg\">Jean-Pierre Escalettes</a>, who had to meet Sarko at the Elys\u00e9e Palace for <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20081015_104122_sifflets-sarkozy-convoque-escalettes_Dev.html\">a wrist-slap</a> following the trouble against Tunisia, nor would it be Gerard Houllier, who reportedly stood up for Domenech after the failure at Euro 2008 before insisting he didn't want the job. No, the man Domenech owes it to is a 22-year-old midfielder who has spent the last two years in Italy, and who is doing a pretty bad job if he wants to stop being compared with Zinedine Zidane.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gourcuffyoann.fr/\">Yoann Gourcuff</a> ran the show in his first France start last month \u2013 days after the team had <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=i39BJNGYsEU\">lost 3-1 to Austria</a> in World Cup qualifying \u2013 and set up the winner for Nicolas Anelka before hitting the bar in a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=64Z0shzdFGo\">2-1 win over Serbia</a>. When France were two down in Romania 10 days ago, it was Gourcuff who smashed in a 30-yarder that <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2d4sleTcU0M\">went in off the crossbar</a> (enjoy the commentary!) to start the comeback in a 2-2 draw \u2013 and his goal was eerily similar to <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1uhxl_zidane-ces-debuts-pro-de-88-a-96_sport\">Zidane's debut strike</a> against Czech Republic in 1994. Meanwhile in the Champions League, Gourcuff - on loan from Milan - put Bordeaux ahead against Roma before Henrique was sent off and <a href=\" http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15276/match=302706/index.html\">the team lost 3-1</a>. </p> <p>Gourcuff was at it again this weekend, scoring an <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=5zRAU9fRdH0\">amazing first goal</a> and setting up the winner for David Bellion in <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3Lq7NW5KeTg\">Bordeaux's 2-1 south-west derby win over Toulouse</a>. \"If Kaka or Ronaldinho had scored that goal, it would be shown all around the world this week,\" said Canal Plus's commentator after the midfielder spun from two defenders with a backheel before smashing the ball past C\u00e9dric Carrasso. \"I had two options, either to pass sideways or backwards but then I saw another solution that the defenders didn't think I could pull off,\" said Gourcuff. \"It was all about instinct.\" </p> <p>The Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said, \"If he carries on like that, he'll be coming back to Milan,\" but the Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud has other ideas. \"We have an option to buy him and it's very clear: if we sign the cheque, he's our player.\" The buy-out clause is reported to be \u20ac12m, but already Gourcuff is worth much more than that. Bordeaux are not normally big spenders, but they can't afford not to buy him.</p> <p>An outcry normally follows when French players leave Ligue 1 at a young age, but there is a feeling that Gourcuff, who was 19 when he moved to Milan from Rennes, has benefited from his time at Milanello. \"We wanted a player who was used to the big time, and we took Yoann because even though he didn't play much Champions League football with Milan, he gained lots of experience from being surrounded by quality players,\" said the Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc.</p> <p>Gourcuff is now flourishing in Blanc's 4-2-3-1 system \u2013 which mirrors how <em>Les Bleus</em> play \u2013 and Bordeaux are up to joint-third as their dismal August becomes a distant memory. Zidane also burst onto the scene at Bordeaux and the pair have similar on-pitch postures and shooting styles. \"Don't put too much pressure on the guy and don't ask him to be the new anybody,\" <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2008/20081020_154132_zidane-veut-installer-mexes_Dev.html\">warned Zidane</a>. \"We can all see he's very talented.\" </p> <p>Bordeaux's win closed the gap on Lyon, who twice came from behind to <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=hdel5awi6sg\">draw 2-2</a> with Claude Puel's former side Lille. Dropping their first points at home this season was not how Jean-Michel Aulas wanted to end his 1,000th match in charge, but the president has other concerns: among them Fred, who started ahead of Karim Benzema but was booed by the supporters. \"These people are not real fans, jeering me is not going to help, and that's why I think I will leave in June.\" The problem for Aulas, who hates players leaving Lyon for nothing, is that Fred cost \u20ac15m and his contract is up next summer.</p> <p>Another Brazilian, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UejTE-79EAk\">Michel Bastos</a>, is threatening to take Juninho's crown as <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4zros_coupfranc-de-michel-bastos_sport\">Ligue 1's free-kick specialist</a>. The Lille midfielder scored his third dead-ball effort of the season against Lyon. \"When I first arrived at Lille I wasn't playing very well, but the boss [who was then Puel] did not lose faith in me. I owe it all to him,\" he said after the game, which may or may not have helped Puel's mood.</p> <p>Just a point behind Lyon now are Marseille, who extended their unbeaten run away from home to 13 games after a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=sqEgitsyV_k\">3-1 win at Valenciennes</a>. L'OM are the one unbeaten side left in France, and have only been trailing in matches for six minutes all season. The work of their new fitness coach Philippe Manouvrier appears to have made a difference. Former players under the coach Eric Gerets have told how he used to hang under-performing players on dressing-room pegs and kick in doors after defeat, but the Belgian cuts a cooler character these days. He even recently <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6zvhp_mr-erik-gerets-a-30-millions-damis_sport\">featured on <em>30 Millions D'Amis</em></a>, a Me And My Pet-style show, where his Great Dane, Georges, was featured lying under his desk at L'OM's Comanderie training-ground. \"Georges is like my son, he comes to work with me and sometimes he joins in training with the players,\" said Gerets. The dog was a gift from the Galatsaray president Ozhan Canaydin after Gerets led them to the title, but caused problems as his white-and-black coat reflected the kit of rivals Besiktas.</p> <p>It's a big week for Gerets, who this week returns to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, where he won six league titles and the European Cup as a player and two titles as a coach. \"The best thing is to win the league title, it's so much more gratifying even than winning the European Cup,\" he said. \"So long as there are no unforeseen accidents, I think we will be up there at the end of the season.\"</p> <p>The same cannot be said of Paris Saint-Germain, who remain in mid-table despite twice coming from behind to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsMsLqwVVyw\">beat their bogey-side Lorient 3-2</a> in a match that their under-pressure coach Paul Le Guen needed to win. The coach has fallen out with the owner Charles Villeneuve over transfer dealings: Le Guen wanted Jimmy Briand, Villeneuve bought the higher-profile Mateja Kezman, whose only success has been to beat Ivan Klasnic and Freddy Adu to <em>France Football</em>'s No1 transfer flop of the season.

  "<p>The British government often congratulates itself on its efforts to keep public finances on a stable and sustainable level. Yesterday Gordon Brown even claimed: \"Debt is considerably lower than a decade ago\". However, Britain's public debt is actually \u00a31,866 billion, equivalent to 125.5% of GDP, nearly three times larger than the government's published figure of \u00a3645 billion and 43.4% of GDP. This measures out as a debt of \u00a376,475 per British household.</p> <p>While figures recently released on the scale of the government's public spending bonanza point to government borrowing leaping to a record \u00a38.1 billion in September, this is only the tip of the iceberg. Opaque off-balance sheet measures have, until revealed in <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/cpsfile.asp?id=1047\">The Price of Irresponsibility</a> published by the <a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/\">Centre for Policy Studies</a>, kept hidden the full cost of projects financed through the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Finance_Initiative\">Private Finance Initiative</a>, the extent of unfunded public sector pension liabilities, the debt incurred by Network Rail and the recent nationalisation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_and_Bingley\">Bradford &amp; Bingley</a>.</p> <p>Yet, the figure may be much worse. While the exact impact on the public finances of the government's recent bail-out of the banking sector is as yet unknown, it could imply an addition of as much as \u00a3500 billion to the balance sheet. This would increase public debt to a massive \u00a32,366 billion, which is 159.1% of GDP, or over \u00a396,967 per British household. </p> <p>Hiding substantial liabilities off the government balance sheet has enabled it to circumvent Gordon Brown's much-lauded \"Golden Rule\" and \"Sustainable Investment Rule\". Political expediency appears to have won out over the need to plan prudently for the country's future. </p> <p>Perhaps the most compelling narrative to be found within the story of public debt is that of transparency, or lack thereof. Without any hint of apparent irony, the government is calling for greater transparency and accountability in the private sector. This is a fine aim, but it must also be matched by transparency in the public sector. To fail to do so risks treading a dangerous line of hypocrisy and double standards. </p> <p>The government also has a responsibility of honesty to the British taxpayer. This extraordinary level of public debt is pushing the costs of current spending onto future generations of taxpayers. In the current economic climate, at a time when British households and businesses are already grappling with the credit crunch, they are now being saddled with more debt than ever before. Yet, the government still pledges to continue borrowing and to spend Britain's way out of the current economic crisis. With already one of the largest budget deficits in the world, the government will simply not be able to continue in this manner. </p> <p>The public spending binge that has brought our public debt up to \u00a31,866 billion by the most conservative estimates is unsustainable. The government must recognise the true scale of public debt and bring some much-needed transparency on to the books before the public finances spiral even further out of control.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 20 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Economic downturn</strong></p> <p>Gordon Brown acknowledged that the UK could not be insulated from the global economic downturn. But he again insisted that with low interest rates and inflation expected to fall, the country was \"stronger than at any other previous downturn\".</p> <p>Amid warnings that the UK had already tipped into recession, the prime minister pledged that the government's \"central mission\" would be to do \"whatever it takes\" to help homeowners and businesses through the \"difficult period ahead\".</p> <p>But the Tory leader, David Cameron, warned that Britain could be heading for a record budget deficit put by some as high as \u00a364bn. \"Isn't the \u00a364bn question this: why, when business and families need more help, have you left the cupboard so bare?\" he demanded, as Brown reported on the outcome of the EU summit.</p> <p><strong>Party funding</strong></p> <p>The justice secretary, Jack Straw, urged MPs to avoid a \"party political dogfight\" over proposed changes to party spending and funding. He said that the \"whole body politic\" would suffer as a result of such a showdown and insisted that consensus was the only way forward.</p> <p>Straw's comments came after Cameron tabled an amendment seeking to block the second reading of the political parties and elections bill. </p> <p>The Tories have accused Labour of trying to rig the general election by changing candidate-spending rules in a way that will favour its MPs fighting to save marginal seats.</p> <p>The bill was denounced as \"outrageous\" and a \"truly partisan piece of legislation\" by the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude.</p> <p>But the justice secretary said: \"I hope that we can agree today on broad principles. Whilst in committee I hope we can work on what I hope will be agreed positions on practicalities. I repeat my commitment to do my best to reach a consensus.\"</p> <p><strong>Housing benefit</strong></p> <p>A housing benefits loophole which led to an Afghan family of eight being moved into \u00a31.2 million taxpayer-funded mansion is to be closed, the work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, disclosed. </p> <p>He said it was \"clearly unacceptable\" that councils were in some cases paying to house people in properties \"they would not be able to afford if they were in work\".</p> <p><strong>National insurance</strong></p> <p>Frank Field, the Labour former minister, criticised figures showing that more than 20,000 new national insurance numbers were issued to foreign nationals last year in Newham, the London borough housing the Olympic village for the 2012 Games. </p> <p>Field also claimed that three times as many NI numbers were issued across the capital to foreign migrants than to people under 25 who are out of work.</p> <p>The employment minister, Tony McNulty, told him: \"The London labour market is absolutely distinct in this country compared to elsewhere in the country, quite rightly as the finest world city.\"</p> <p><strong>Top-up drugs</strong></p> <p>The government was accused of changing its policy on patients paying for top-up drugs. </p> <p>The claims came as Lady Thornton, for the government, said that \"some trusts are allowing patients to buy additional private drugs and retain their entitlement to NHS care while others are not\".</p> <p>Lord Naseby, the Conservative peer, said: \"The minister a year ago told this very house that co-payments did not form part of the basic principles of the NHS. Now we discover there are a number of NHS trusts that have been carrying out co-payments, presumably without the knowledge of the Department of Health.\"</p>",
  "<p>After Israelis and Americans, Indians are probably among the least welcome people in Pakistan. Nevertheless, a fortnight ago I crossed over the border from Amritsar to Lahore for the first time to visit the land of (half) my ancestors. While angry rhetoric between the two nuclear-armed neighbours has calmed down significantly over the past decade, some flashpoints such as Kashmir and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7666573.stm\">water disputes</a> still remain, making the local politics still difficult.</p> <p>Pakistan is still on edge, this time primarily from terrorist bombings from Taliban elements that rock the nation almost daily. During my first full day in Karachi, three suicide attacks took place, one blowing up the anti-terrorism taskforce building. </p> <p>Last week, both British and American generals said we needed more troops in Afghanistan to turn the country around. But this ignores the deeper problem \u2013 to win in Afghanistan, first the battle for Pakistan must be won. And right now that's not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/17/pakistan-nato\">looking too good</a>.</p> <p>The pessimist's view is convincing: the Taliban have turned on their former masters; people are increasingly angry with US military incursions; the country's finances are very precarious; its politicians remain unpopular and are unlikely to resolve this mess. Furthermore, Afghan volatility is hurting Pakistan, as immigrants, guns and drugs flow over the borders with little to check them.</p> <p>The optimist's view is that Pakistan has been through much worse in its past and still managed to pull through. Already there are growing efforts to challenge each of these problems. When I told the rickshaw driver at the border I was of Indian origin, he only smiled and asked if I wouldn't mind giving him a souvenir from there. And he refused to take any money. Pakistan has a knack for surprises.</p> <p>Last year, a British born and trained journalist of Pakistani origin, Waseem Mahmood, got together a bunch of well-known Pakistani actors and singers to compose a song against terrorism titled Yeh Hum Naheen (This is not us). It quickly became a sensation and inspired a <a href=\"http://www.yehhumnaheen.org/cc.php?finalpage_os=index.php\">petition against terrorism</a> launched earlier this year that enlisted the help of over 9,000 volunteers to gather over 60 million signatures from across the country. It is being entered into the Guinness Books of Records as the biggest petition ever.</p> <p>Such efforts usually pass under the notice of mainstream media across the world, because the only story out of Pakistan is usually a negative one involving terrorist camps. While there may be some truth to this, less attention is paid to how Pakistanis themselves are trying to deal with the issue.</p> <p>The government recently unveiled an ad campaign stating: \"Terrorists are the enemies of Islam, Pakistan and our people.\" A media organisation \u2013 the Jang Group \u2013 has even launched it own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/20/middle-east-media\">anti-terrorism campaign</a>. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Pakistanis feel helpless because they have little faith in their political leaders and the army has lost much credibility in recent years under General Musharraf. Locally organised lashkars (armies) and jirgas (gatherings) of tribal leaders against the Taliban have been viciously attacked. </p> <p>But, encouragingly, the debate in Pakistan on extremism and terrorism is rapidly following the trajectory of developments here in Britain.</p> <p>The first phase is denial. Both in the UK and Pakistan, Muslims blamed Americans for the existence of terrorism. If we pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan, everything will be fine, the thinking went.</p> <p>But this ignores a deeper problem: why are people choosing to blow up themselves and innocent people as a form of political protest? The existence of suicide terrorism is a problem in itself. Unsurprisingly, the first phase of Mahmood's campaign focuses on owning the issue: Terrorism is our problem and we have to deal with it. Similarly, in the UK, the discussion of terrorism among British Muslims has moved on from blaming others for the problem to owning the issue.</p> <p>And then what? \"There's too many people sitting around producing reports on what the problem is, and not enough people trying to deal with the problem of terrorism,\" Mahmood says. Accordingly, they now focus on getting Pakistanis to talk about terrorism at home, at school and more openly.</p> <p>Talking about extremism out in the open in local communities is more difficult, but is the only way to start a system of detection and prevention. </p> <p>The YHN campaign is ahead of the curve because the rest of Pakistani society has not yet accepted that if you give an inch to religious terrorists they will take a mile. The Taliban have no qualms about blowing up innocent Muslims across Pakistan and trying to destabilise the country \u2013 their aims are political, not religious. </p> <p>Here lies the solution too. Pakistanis are intensely nationalist people, born out of the uncertain nature of the partition and always feeling threatened by their larger neighbour. But as the Taliban becomes a bigger threat to national security rather than India, public opinion will slowly but surely move against them.</p> <p>But as one prominent media executive said under the condition of anonymity, it may take a few more big blasts like the Marriott before Pakistanis realise the true nature of the Taliban. And then a new direction will surely have to be found. As the country's celebrated Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz once said, the danger is that Pakistan will continue as it has always done.</p>",
  "<p>The barbs, darts and retorts may come to a halt for a few days this week, as Barack Obama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/barack-obama-campaign-grandmother-illness\">returns to Hawaii to visit his grandmother</a>, who is reported to be seriously ill. Madelyn Dunham, 86, helped raise the young Obama after his father abandoned the family and while his mother was busy with her studies and her career. The campaign has cancelled Thursday rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa, but will hold an event in Indianapolis before Obama flies to Hawaii. He returns to the campaign trail Saturday.</p> <p>Before Obama spokesman and strategist Robert Gibbs broke the news about Obama's granny, Democrats were treated to the sight of their candidate onstage with his erstwhile rival Hillary Clinton in Orlando. As Richard Luscombe writes on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a>, Clinton urged her supporters: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/obama-clinton-florida-democrat-election\">If you knocked on doors for me, knock on doors for Barack</a>. If you made calls for me, make them for Barack.\"</p> <p>Obama, who beat Clinton to win the Democratic nomination in June after a blistering 16-month campaign, praised her and said: \"I'm proud to call her my friend\".</p> <p>The McCain campaign, meanwhile, is running short of money. A day after Obama announced he had raised a record-breaking $150m in September, McCain revealed in public campaign finance filings that he has only $54m remaining for the two weeks until election day. That may sound flush, but McCain must now play defence in several states once thought safely Republican. Ewen MacAskill writes that the funding disparity will mean that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/barack-obama-campaign-grandmother-illness\">McCain's options are much narrower than Obama's</a>, forcing him to target the money more carefully on key states.</p> <p>As the future looks increasingly bleak for the McCain camp, evangelical Christians, an important part of the Republican base, are pondering what may be their exile in the wilderness come election day. From Colorado Springs, Colorado, Suzanne Goldenberg writes in today's Guardian that the prospect of an Obama victory <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/21/uselections2008-barackobama\">represents sheer calamity to conservative Christian leaders</a>, while a number of evangelical leaders have also begun asking whether their movement has drifted too far to the right</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama is in Florida while Biden campaigns in Colorado. McCain holds three rallies in Pennsylvania, while Palin campaigns in Nevada. Expect McCain and Palin to continue to throw around the word \"Obama\" and \"socialism\" and in the same sentence, in an attempt to scare voters away from the Democratic ticket.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Gallup's daily tracking poll shows Obama's lead has rebounded to 11 points, giving him 52% to McCain's 41%. The result indicates that McCain's \"Joe the Plumber\" theme has not won him fresh support. Meanwhile, Obama continues to surge in once-safe Republican states. A Suffolk University poll shows the two candidates in a statistical tie in Missouri, which has not voted Democratic since 1996.</p> <h2>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com\">theguardian.com</a> now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/21/obama-clinton-florida\">Video: Hillary Clinton - 'Work as hard for Barack as you did for me'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-barackobama\"> Road trip video: 'Obama is a liar' - gun owners sound off</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/20/us-elections-first-time-voter\">Truth booth: first-time voter Candice Sena - 'It's our generation who will pay'</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/20/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Michael Tomasky: How John McCain picked Sarah Palin</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/oct/21/comedy-sarahpalin\">Ed Pilkington: The Feylin phenomenon</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/quiz/2008/oct/21/sarah-palin-tina-fey\">Quiz: Feylin or Palin?</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/opinion/kamiya/2008/10/21/taxes/\">Salon.com: Joe the Plumber's brother is mad as hell</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/20/AR2008102002292.html\">Washington Post: Republicans party like it's 1964</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theweek.com/article/index/89946/3/Dont_go_wobbly_Dems\">The Week: Don't go wobbly, Dems</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,585119,00.html\">Der Spiegel: Why Europeans love Obama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122455099434052597.html\">Wall Street Journal: Get ready for the new New Deal</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/horseraceblog/2008/10/the_state_of_the_race_1.html\">Real Clear Politics: The state of the race</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"These attacks, like John McCain and Sarah Palin using terms like 'socialism,' I mean, it's like they're running a campaign in 1955.\" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.</p> <p>\"John's been there and he's met a little tougher people in his life than the liberal media,\" McCain supporter Senator Lindsey Graham, alluding to McCain's years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>10:35am:</strong> The title doesn't sound exciting. The Commons business and enterprise committee is taking evidence on the \"departmental annual report\" and the \"current economic situation\". </p> <p>But it's Peter Mandelson's first formal appearance before MPs in his new job and so they're likely to ask him about pretty much anything. Well, maybe not everything. In the light of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4982255.ece\">today's allegations in the Times,</a> the Tories may keep quiet about Oleg Deripaska. But flexible working and the future of the Post Office are almost certain to come up.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>10:38am:</strong> I see the order paper has got him down as Lord Mandelson of Foy and Hartlepool. As <a href=\"http://lordsoftheblog.wordpress.com/2008/10/16/its-lord-mandelson/\">Lord Norton</a> explained last week, that's wrong. It should just be Lord Mandelson, or Lord Mandelson, of Foy and Hartlepool. Read Norton. He'll tell you why the comma is important.</p> <p>Mandelson is here. He introduces himself as Peter Mandelson. And the chairman, the Tory MP Peter Luff, wishes him happy birthday.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>10:39am:</strong> Luff says he wants to cover three areas: <br>1) the machinery of government changes <br>2) the recession - \"I think we're allowed to use that word now\", Luff says <br>3) and the Post Office and flexible working.</p> <p>Luff says that when Mandelson went to Brussels, the bookies were offering odds of 3-1 on him leaving before his time was up.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>10:42am:</strong> Mandelson ducks the question, but he does want to comment on the Post Office and flexible working. He says that the quotes in the FT were not based on anything he had said to them in the last 72 hours. And he did not speak to the Independent (that covered the flexible working story). The way the story was presented owed more to the imagination of the subs, he claims, than to the intention of the reporter (Andrew Grice).</p> <p>Pressed on the FT, he says the quotes came from a \"casual conversation\" he had with an FT journalist after his appointment. But he did not find the report \"alarming\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>10:43am:</strong> Luff says he does not want to get distracted by the \"excitable\" stories in the press. I think that's a reference to Deripaska. Luff says the Lords register of interests goes back three years. Does that mean that Mandelson will have to declare relevant interests going back three years?</p> <p>Mandelson says he doesn't know. But he stressed that, when he was a European commissioner, he was covered by a code of conduct.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>10:46am:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong></p> <p>Luff asks if he thinks it sensible for the department - he says his committee still prefers to think of it as the Department for Trade and Industry - to lose responsibility for energy.</p> <p>Mandelson says he thinks it makes sense for energy to be in a new department with climate change. He's meeting Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, later today for their first bilateral about how the two departments will work together.</p> <p>Britain is in a good position to be a market leader in climate change technology.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>10:51am:</strong> Britain is in a good position to be a market leader in climate change technology.</p> <p>Michael Clapham, Labour, asks how many staff the department will lose to the new energy department. And how much of it's budget will go.</p> <p>Mandelson says 520 staff will transfer from DBERR (Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform - Mandelson's department) to Decc (the Department for Energy and Climate Change - I haven't heard that acronym before). Decc will also get \u00a335m for administration, compared to DBERR's \u00a3297m.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10:58am:</strong> Asked what he will bring to the department, Mandelson talks about the \"experience and knowledge\" that he has gained.</p> <p>Mark Oaten, Lib Dem, asks if there were any European regulations that worked against British interests.</p> <p>\"I don't think so,\" says Mandelson. But he says he shared with the British government concerns about directives like the agency workers directive.</p> <p>Luff asks if Mandelson is happy about the department no longer having responsibility for science.</p> <p>Mandelson says Luff is asking about decisions \"way above my pay grade\". Luff replies: \"There's nothing way above your pay grade\".</p> <p>On the question, Mandelson says that if he had been around when responsibility for science was taken away from the department, and given instead to John Denham's innovation department, he would have argued against it. But he can see the logic for science being placed alongside higher education.</p> <p>But \"we are where we are,\" he says. \"It has been agreed - decided, rather\" - a nice Mandelson line. He admires decisive prime ministers.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11:01am:</strong> Luff says he's running a department that is now \"a shadow of its former self\". He's lost science and energy. But he's still in charge of anti-corruption, although the officials dealing with anti-corruption report to Jack Straw, the justice secretary, who was named last week as the government's anti-corruption champion. Why's that?, asks Luff.</p> <p>Good question. The assumption at Westmister was that Straw was given the job because giving it to Mandelson would have given the press an incentive to bang on about his two resignations.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11:05am:</strong> Mandelson says that, before John Hutton had the anti-corruption job, it was held by Hilary Benn (when he was international development secretary, I presume).</p> <p>Mandelson stresses that he thinks Britain has a very good anti-corruption record. Luff says he is still \"puzzled\" why the officials dealing with this report to the permanent secretary in their department, but not to their secretary of state, but he does not press the point - or ask directly about Mandelson's two previous resignations.</p> <p>Mandelson wants to mention his action programme for the economy. Luff asks him to wait until they get onto the economy.</p> <p>Brian Binley, Conservative, asks about Mandelson's relationship with Gordon Brown. This should get interesting. He quotes Mandelson as saying that David Cameron had been \"swinging around like a pendulum\". Isn't that what Mandelson has been doing in his relations with Brown and Tony Blair?</p> <p>Mandelson quibbles about what he actually said. Luff - correctly - suggests he's playing for time.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>11:09am:</strong> On the main point, he says that his allegiance has always been to New Labour. He's always been \"rock-solid\" in that respect. \"I'm not for budging.\"</p> <p><strong>America</strong></p> <p>Julie Kirkbride, Conservative, asks if Mandelson is worried about the US turning protectionist after the presidential election.</p> <p>Mandelson says he is concerned about this. He has been \"encouraged\" by what John McCain has said about his commitment to open markets and free trade. </p> <p>And he's been \"encouraged\" by what Barack Obama has said \"more recently\" on this subject, although earlier Obama and Hillary Clinton were competing for the protectionist, blue-collar vote. He hopes that, whoever wins, the US will continue to embrace free trade.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11:12am:</strong> It's a very diplomatic answer. He came close to criticising the Democrats, but without actually doing so.</p> <p>Kirkbride presses him on this. Wouldn't it be worse under the Democrats? Mandelson doesn't accept this.</p> <p>Luff says the committee will return to this at a later stage, perhaps with an inquiry.</p> <p><strong>Accountability to parliament<br></strong><br>Luff asks if Mandelson is adequately accountable to the House of Commons.</p> <p>\"If you feel unhappy about my accountability, then that would worry me,\" Mandelson replies. He wants to maintain his accountability to the Commons through this committee. He describes them as his \"principal Commons masters\".</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11:15am:</strong> He might have to see them more often than a normal cabinet minister to ensure accountability. This sounds quite flattering - which will probably go down well.</p> <p>Luff isn't easily put off. He says that, of the six ministers in the department, Mandelson and another two - Lady Vadera and Stephen Carter - are in the Lords. And of the three Commons ministers, two of them are shared with other departments: Gareth Thomas, who also works for international development, and Ian Pearson, who also works for the Treasury. The only DBERR minister in the Commons working solely for the department is Pat McFadden. Luff says he's concerned about this.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11:18am:</strong> Mandelson says these weren't his decisions.</p> <p>Gareth Thomas will be travelling a lot, as a Dfid minister, Luff says. And Pearson is taking Treasury legislation through the Commons.</p> <p>Lindsay Hoyle, Labour, says that these two are \"part-time ministers\". There should be a full-time minister of state answerable to the Commons.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11:24am:</strong> Mandelson defends \"sharing\" ministers. He says that when he was last at the (then) DTI, it did not cooperate with the culture department as well as it should have done. Carter will be able to \"straddle\" the two departments, as he did when he launched an initiative on digital technology at the end of last week.</p> <p>Mark Oaten says all MPs have got small business issues that they want to take up with a minister. But they can't take it up with the small business minister (Vadera) because she's in the Lords.</p> <p>Mandelson says he has not detected any unhappiness amongst business about the arrangements. Referring to Vadera, he says he has never thought of her as being \"hidden away\". (She is famously forthright.)</p> <p>Luff says that Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, has written to the committee asking to give evidence about Mandelson's lack of accountability.</p> <p>Mandelson floats the idea of changing Commons rules to allow him to appear at the dispatch box to be questioned by MPs. But he's straying \"beyond his comfort zone\", he says. It's an idea that Commons reformers have floated before, but it's hard to tell whether Mandelson is serious about it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11:34am:</strong> Clapham asks whether the proceeds of the sale of the government's stake in British Energy (to EDF) will go into the nuclear liabilities fund (NLF). The sale raised \u00a312.5bn, and the government's stake was worth 35%. Mandelson and his permanent secretary, Sir Brian Bender, confirm that the money will go into the NLF.</p> <p>Luff points out that there is not a select committee overseeing the work of the new Department for Energy and Climate Change. His committee will do the job in the meantime.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>11:37am:</strong> <strong>The economy</strong></p> <p>Mandelson defends the decision to set up at national economic council. (It replaced another cabinet committee, and some critics said the innovation was cosmetic one, merely the renaming of a committee that already existed.) Mandelson says having the prime minister chairing the council, and having it meet twice a week has made it effective.</p> <p>Roger Berry, Labour, asks if the department was involved in the negotiations with the banks on the bail-out plan. Mandelson says Vadera was heavily involved.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11:43am:</strong> Bender says that permanent secretaries from various departments were involved in regular meetings with the Treasury before the summer about the economic crisis.</p> <p>Luff says the national economic council is \"just another cabinet sub-committee\". It's \"hardly a great solution to all our problems\".</p> <p>Mandelson rejects this. If Luff were to attend, he would not say that.</p> <p>So Mandelson thinks it has a different quality?</p> <p>\"I really do,\" says Mandelson. \"I think it's qualitatively quite different in its focus, in its urgency [and in the way other ministers are put on the spot].\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>11:48am:</strong> Banks</p> <p>Mike Weir, SNP, asks if there will be enough competition in the banking sector following the Lloyds TSB/HBOS merger.</p> <p>Mandelson says he's always a \"hawk\" on competition issues. The OFT is producing two reports on the proposed merger, one relating to competition and the other relating to financial stability. They are due at the end of this week.</p> <p>Weir says the takeover was planned before the bank bail-out plan was launched. There are now suggestions that, following recapitalisation, HBOS could survive on its own. Could this happen?</p> <p>Mandelson says the government does not expect this to happen; the merger is due to go ahead.</p> <p>But could the two banks still get the money if the merged did not go ahead, Weir asks.</p> <p>Mandelson says the recapitalisation is predicated on the merger going ahead. He has not heard any suggestions from the two banks that they don't want the merger to go ahead.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11:52am:</strong> This is a big issue in Scotland. <a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/latestnews/Why-a-Lloyds-TSB-takeover.4611246.jp\">The Scotsman</a> today has published an open letter to the OFT, calling for the merger to be blocked on the grounds that it would have a damaging effect on Scottish businesses and customers.</p> <p>Weir asks about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/21/lloydstsbgroup-executivesalaries\">Guardian report saying that Lloyds TSB staff will still get their bonuses</a>. Mandelson says he's \"behind the curve\" on this story. He has not read the Guardian report. But he thinks it is an issue that the Treasury will want to take up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>11:58am:</strong> Julie Kirkbride, Conservative, says that when the merger plans were first drawn up, there were provisions to protect jobs in Scotland, but not in Halifax. Is that fair?</p> <p>Mandelson says she's making an assumption. \"It was in the document,\" Kirkbride says. (She was brought up in Halifax.) Mandelson does not address this, but says that he expects the regional development agencies in places such as Yorkshire to get involved in ensuring that jobs are not lost.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>12:03pm:</strong> In response to another question, Mandelson says credit rating agencies need to \"polish up their act\".</p> <p><strong>Small businesses</strong></p> <p>Binley says the banks have had \"billions and billions\" of taxpayers' money. Will Mandelson ensure that they take steps to help small businesses?</p> <p>Yes, says Mandelson. He's meeting bank bosses with the chancellor, Alistair Darling, on Thursday to discuss this.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12:06pm:</strong> Cash flow is an important issue for banks. Central government has already said it will pay its invoices to small businesses within 10 days. Mandelson \"announces\" (although it has already been briefed) that Hazel Blears, the communities secretary, and Alan Johnson, the health secretary, will be writing to councils and NHS trusts to ensure that they do the same.</p> <p>There have been proposals relating to VAT and national insurance, he says, referring to the plans floated by the Conservatives. He criticises both plans: the national insurance cut would be funded by a tax on other businesses (because the Tories would fund it by cutting reliefs) and the VAT holiday idea would result in small businesses accumulating bigger bills to pay in the future.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>12:09pm:</strong> Mandelson also addresses the issue of access to credit. As part of the bail-out package, banks have to lend at 2007 levels to small and medium-sized businesses. Mandelson says that in practice this means that they will have to have access to capital if they need it.</p> <p>The government will monitor how the banks are performing in this area. And it will make sure that these policies are pursued \"at branch level\".</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12:15pm:</strong> Binley says banks need quick decisions.</p> <p>Mandelson says the government also wants \"care and sensitivity\" from the revenue authorities. His officials have already raised this with Revenue &amp; Customs, which, he says, already has a policy of \"flexibility\" when it comes to dealing with tax payments from small businesses.</p> <p>Oaten asks Mandelson if he can make the government procurement process easier for small businesses. And Hoyle asks if there is any scope for giving firms more time to pay their business rates.</p> <p>Mandelson says the chancellor is \"very mindful\" of the need to bring forward capital projects to inject more money into the economy. And a review is already under way into government procurement and small businesses.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>12:20pm:</strong> <strong>Flexible working</strong></p> <p>Adrian Bailey, Labour, asks about an article in the FT this morning saying there has been a \"furious backlash\" to the proposal to shelve the implementation of more flexible working.</p> <p>\"This very fierce backlash hasn't reached me yet,\" Mandelson says. \"And my telephone number's in the book.\" (I'm not sure that it is, but never mind.)</p> <p>But he says he did hear a TUC official discuss the proposal on the Today programme this morning. (I can't remember her name, but she was opposed to delaying implementation of the flexible working proposals.)</p> <p>Mandelson says that agreeing to look at something is not the same as agreeing to do it. It is \"not the case\" that he has come to a decision.</p> <p>He welcomes the views expressed by the TUC, just as he welcomes the views of employer organisations.</p> <p>But it is not a foregone conclusions that he will reach one view or another, he goes on.</p> <p>I'm not sure that clears things up much at all. Or is there a third way?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>12:25pm:</strong> But Bailey seems satisfied. He's moving onto a different question, relating to the assessment of regulatory burdens.</p> <p>Mandelson says the regulatory impact assessment of flexible working shows a cost to business of \u00a369m, but a gain to business worth \u00a391m (through greater flexibility). He seems to be referring to extending the \"right to request\" flexible working for parents of children up to the age of 16 - the proposals due to come into force next year.</p> <p>This is significant. It suggests the proposals won't be shelved.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>12:28pm:</strong> <strong>Post Office</strong></p> <p>Hoyle says he hopes that Royal Mail remains. Is Mandelson going to renegotiate the universal service delivery provisions.</p> <p>Mandelson says the biggest problems the Royal Mail faces are the fall in the volume of post, and the \"ballooning\" size of its pensions liabilities.</p> <p>Customers are moving away from the post. Market conditions for all postal operators are \"challenging\". That's why a review was set up under Richard Hooper. \"I believe that initiial findings present a rather stark picture of conditions in the postal market.\"</p> <p>He does not want to be drawn on premature responses or conclusions. There is no timetable for the review. But he may ask Hooper to widen it, to include other factors.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>12:33pm:</strong> But he remains \"strongly committed to the Royal Mail. What we want to see is it being efficient, modernised, viable.\"</p> <p>(But he doesn't include \"publicly-owned\" in this list of adjectives.)</p> <p>Hoyle asks if Mandelson will use procurement policies to support British industry.</p> <p>Mandelson says that when he was a European commissioner he insisted on being driven around Brussels in a British-made Jaguar.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>12:36pm:</strong> Luff winds up. But he says he's \"confused\" about Mandelson's position on the Royal Mail. He suggests that Mandelson has \"disavowed\" the FT story about Royal Mail part-privatisation.</p> <p>But Mandelson didn't disavow that, as he says himself.</p> <p>Now he's off. He's got to catch a train at 1pm.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>12:45pm:</strong> <strong>Instant summary</strong></p> <p><strong>Flexible working:</strong> Mandelson confirmed that he is reviewing plans to extend flexible working rules next year, but he stressed that he had not taken any decisions, and he criticised the way his intentions were reported in the Independent yesterday. But he also made a point of quoting figures about the way the provisions could help businesses, which I took as a clear hint that the reforms will not be shelved.</p> <p><strong>Royal Mail:</strong> Mandelson also tried to distance himself from the report in yesterday's FT saying that he was in favour of the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail. But he did not deny the quotes attributed to him, or the comments in the paper saying he \"remains inclined towards a greater role for the private sector in the Royal Mail\". </p> <p>He also said that the ongoing Hooper review of postal services was going to present a \"rather stark picture\" of prospects in the industry and that he could widen its scope. Although he stressed his commitment to Royal Mail, he did not mention his commitment to it being \"publicly-owned\". I expect the unions will find this troubling.</p> <p><strong>Small businesses:</strong> Mandelson confirmed that the order requiring government departments to pay small businesses within 10 days of being billed will be extended to local authorities and NHS trusts. He also said he and the chancellor, Alistair Darling, would be meeting bank chiefs on Thursday to make sure they honoured their obligations to lend to small businesses.</p> <p><strong>Appearing in the Commons:</strong> Mandelson did concede that there's a case for cabinet ministers who sit in the Lords being required to appear in the Commons. If that were to happen, it would be a significant constitutional innovation.</p> <p><strong>Part-time ministers:</strong> Even Labour MPs on the committee were unhappy about the fact that the business department has six ministers, of whom only one - Pat McFadden - sits in the Commons and does not have responsibilities to other departments.</p> <p><strong>Anti-corruption unit:</strong> It was reported last week that Mandelson had \"lost\" the post of anti-corruption champion that was held by his predecessor. But I didn't realise that the officials dealing with this still all sit in his department. Mandelson couldn't offer a good explanation for this.</p>",
  "<p>As the trailer for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/126328/watchmen\">Watchmen</a> makes more frequent appearances in cinemas all over the world, fanatical enthusiasts of the graphic novel tear into every frame, wondering how faithful it might be, how dedicated to retaining the sense of the original, how true to Alan Moore's vision, how tainted by the move from dark, complex, detail-filled frames to be consumed at the reader's leisure, to 24 frames a second.</p> <p>But not everyone catching the trailer at the beginning of a random movie will be aware of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/08/watchmen\">the complex 20-year development of the adaptation</a>. What might the average non-comic-loving cinemagoer take away from seeing the movie trailed in front of them, 50 feet high? If, for example, most average cinemagoers know bugger-all about the mighty Watchmen, what more might they have learned by the end of this two-minute trailer?</p> <p><strong>12sec</strong> There is a man in what appears to be a highly charged room. In that it is full of dangerous electrical sparks, sorry, rather than the sense of \"socially tense\". He looks a bit tense, mind. Probably due to the imminent possibility of death by electrocution. </p> <p><strong>18sec: IN 2009</strong> the screen says in big yellow letters, careering through the inner workings of something clockwork ...<br>We see the man from the electric room with sparks coursing down his arm. Apart from a slight problem with residual sparkiness, the man in the electrical room seems to be absolutely fine. We breathe a sigh of relief. </p> <p><strong>30sec</strong> Then he blows up.</p> <p>It is, however, that kind of blowing up that people do just before they develop super powers, so we (the comic-illiterate audience) rest safe in the knowledge that it is almost certainly that kind of movie.</p> <p><strong>EVERYTHING WE KNOW WILL CHANGE</strong> the screen promises us, following on from the \"In 2009\" statement. I think we can be quite secure in the \"superhuman powers coming from freak scientific occurrences\" knowledge, though. We're quite safe in that, I think.</p> <p><strong>38sec</strong> A mysterious object rises from out of seething water like a small tin cow rising out of a bath full of fart-bubbles. In the background: Manhattan complete with twin towers - now the quickest visual clue to something being in the past. Albeit a past with large tin things flying out of bubbly water.</p> <p><strong>43sec</strong> Someone falls through a fiery roof. On closer inspection, it appears to be a young woman. She appears to be wearing some kind of skintight leather bodysuit. </p> <p>We can therefore assume her to have some kind of special powers too, because all women who have special powers wear skintight leather bodysuits (their special powers all come with a free extra superpower governing bladder control. Because it's either that, or their leather bodysuits come with a bum-flap, which isn't very super at all).</p> <p><strong>47sec</strong> A glimpse of another super-person, dressed all in black, with a cape and what appear to be pointy ears. We assume this to be Batman, because why would you have another superhero dressed exactly like Batman who wasn't Batman?</p> <p>The music, pumping away in the background, supports this theory somewhat as it is, we believe, The Beginning is the End is the Beginning, the B-side of The End is the Beginning is the End, written by Billy Corgan especially for the Batman and Robin soundtrack, and not performed by the Smashing Pumpkins between then and now.</p> <p><strong>56sec</strong> Within the next 10 seconds, another man in leather (black and silver) with no mask, and someone with a flame-thrower and some opaque black-and-white tights covering his face. They appear to be flattening the features somewhat, so I conclude that they are almost certainly Spanx or some other body-control tights. </p> <p><strong>57sec</strong> Another view of the super-lady, whose outfit appears to be a miraculous use of coloured leather and/or rubber designed in a two-tone pattern to look almost exactly like a crotchless leotard, suspenders and stockings, and elbow-length gloves.</p> <p><strong>1min 1sec</strong> Another superperson or three, this time mournful glowing gentlemen with scary dark eyes. At this rate, we're beginning to suspect that this is a super-movie featuring around 38 separate supers, and that we will have less than a 4% chance of keeping tabs on who's good and who's bad.</p> <p>Batman appears again. But we're pretty sure it can't be Batman, as we'd have heard about another Batman movie so soon. Perhaps it is another hero based on a flying critter. Reliable Robin! No, he would be the sidekick. CROWGUY! I like it.</p> <p><strong>Stuff happens.</strong> A funeral, an American flag and at <strong>1min 13sec</strong>, the belief we've just spotted Robert Downey Jr. An Iron Man sequel, then? With Batman in it? Crowguy, sorry?</p> <p><strong>1min 15sec-1min 30sec</strong> A protest calling for fewer vigilantes and more policemen gets blown up. I'm not surprised they're protesting, if \"vigilantes\" are these pesky superpeople. For they are EVERYWHERE, you'd be tripping over capes and loose strands of spideythread like nobody's business. It is a health hazard.</p> <p><strong>1min 30sec</strong> Ah. <strong>FROM THE VISIONARY DIRECTOR OF \"300\"</strong> says the big writing, suggesting we might expect more teen-pleasing sweaty violent maleness and subtle homoeroticism than we have so far seen, into the bargain. Hopefully no more people marching hundreds of miles in hotpants, though. That would chafe dreadfully, don't you think?</p> <p><strong>1min 40sec</strong> A man in a bathrobe we haven't seen before punches a wall, someone slams John Malkovich (maybe) up against bathroom tiles, and some joker in a purple suit knocks a guy into a standing pool. I have no idea if any or all of these are new characters.</p> <p>Whoever they are, they're from the <strong>MOST CELEBRATED GRAPHIC NOVEL OF ALL TIME</strong> which immediately puts us in our place. It is our fault for being confused, then.</p> <p><strong>1min 40sec onward:</strong> \"The earth will look up and shout: 'Save us!' And I will whisper no,\" says a deep dark voice, unpleasantly. </p> <p>Another view of the man with patterned Spanx for a face (who may or may not be the \"face\" behind the words), the lady in leather snogs one of the shiny people, who then appears to float in big shiny cruciform in an office full of panicking people, before the leather-lass and someone shiny are seen rising out of the clouds in a giant gyroscope. </p> <p>And that's it. Apart from the label, <strong>WATCHMEN</strong>.</p> <p>In 2009, everything we know will change. <br>And as long as, for the majority of us who might not have read the most celebrated graphic novel of all time, the first thing to change is \"some vague understanding of what the heck is going on\" then we can only see this shift in knowledge as a good thing, frankly.</p>",
  "<h2>European Union</h2> <p>Germany, France, Italy and 12 other European countries unveiled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/useconomy-usa\">a comprehensive plan for salvaging their banking systems from potential ruin</a>. </p> <p>Under the 13-point draft plan, the European Central Bank (ECB) will intervene in the financial turmoil to boost liquidity. Meanwhile, eurozone governments will underwrite bank debt until the end of next year and commit to preventing the collapse of \"systematically relevant institutions through appropriate means including recapitalisation\". </p> <p>The three elements - liquidity support, interbank lending guarantees and recapitalisation of distressed banks - are the core of Gordon Brown's plan announced earlier this month. The UK model now looks set to become the European standard, with national variations to take account of differing systems. </p> <p>Factoring in Britain's estimated \u00a3500bn package as well as parallel plans in parts of Scandinavia and central Europe outside the 15-country eurozone, the package could take the cost for the EU's 27 states to \u20ac2tn (\u00a31.52tn). </p> <p>EU finance ministers have tried to bolster confidence in the battered banking system by agreeing to raise the minimum level of guarantee on bank savings across member states from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac50,000 for one year. They have also agreed to support bigger financial institutions that might cause systemic failure if they were allowed to go under. Some may guarantee up to \u20ac100,000. </p> <p>The ECB also joined the coordinated rate cut and is offering unlimited liquidity at weekly auctions. </p> <h2>Britain</h2> <p>A \u00a339bn bank bail-out sees RBS, and a merged HBOS and Lloyds, effectively nationalised. The Special Liquidity Scheme was extended to make another \u00a3200bn available and new debt issued by banks has been guaranteed up to \u00a3250bn.</p> <p>The savings guarantee for depositors was raised from \u00a335,000 to \u00a350,000 and the Bank of England cut interest rates by half a point. Short-selling in 34 financial stocks was banned until January.</p> <h2>Ireland</h2> <p>Deposits held in the country's six biggest banks and two building societies have been guaranteed for two years after Irish bank shares suffered huge price falls at the end of September. </p> <p>The \u20ac400bn scheme was also extended to foreign-owned banks which have significant operations in Ireland.</p> <h2>Greece</h2> <p>Under existing law, the Greek government guarantees just the first \u20ac20,000 of savers' deposits. Parliament is considering legislation to raise guarantees to \u20ac100,000 for three years.</p> <p>In a crackdown on short-selling, the regulator publishes a daily account of all short sales and the number of shares purchased by borrowing.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>All private German bank accounts are guaranteed and \u20ac400bn of medium-term bank lending has been guaranteed to get credit markets moving again.</p> <p>The government is providing a further \u20ac100bn in fresh capital to recapitalise banks and underwrite banks' debt issuance.</p> <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was abandoning her aim of balancing Germany's budget by 2011.</p> <p>\"Naked\" short-selling has been banned in 11 financial stocks until the end of the year.</p> <h2>Denmark</h2> <p>Denmark, which has some of the most exposed banks, has guaranteed all bank deposits with a $6.5bn liquidation fund. Deposits in Danish banks had previously been guaranteed up to 300,000 krone (\u00a331,000).</p> <p>In return for the government guarantee, banks agreed to pay up to Kr35bn over two years into a liquidation fund that could take over distressed institutions to avoid losses to depositors and certain creditors.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>The government is injecting \u20ac10.5bn (\u00a38bn) into six leading banks but denied this was a crisis measure. Short-selling in banks and insurance stocks was banned on September 22 for three months. Christine Lagarde, the finance minister, said they would offer \u20ac3bn to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, \u20ac2.5bn to BNP and \u20ac1.7bn to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to help them \"correctly\" finance the economy.</p> <h2>Iceland</h2> <p>The three largest banks - Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki - were nationalised. All trading on the stock exchange was suspended for three days. </p> <p>Iceland has asked Russia for a \u20ac4bn loan and introduced emergency laws giving the government sweeping powers over banks.</p> <p>Its central bank has cut interest rates by three and a half percentage points. </p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>The government has given $100bn in extra liquidity to the banking sector and $37bn in long-term loans to the largest banks. A further $50bn has been given in loans to help refinance debt-laden companies and banks.</p> <p>Trading has been halted on stockmarkets on several occasions after the steepest falls on record. </p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>Under emergency measures, the state is allowed to underwrite recapitialisation of banks or become a shareholder. Deposits of up to \u20ac103,000 are guaranteed. </p> <p>The central bank has made \u20ac40bn of treasury bills available to refinance bank debt.</p> <p>Short-sellers must have stock available from moment placed.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p>Guarantees on bank deposits have increased five-fold to \u20ac100bn, while a \u20ac30bn-\u20ac50bn emergency fund will provide liquidity by buying bank assets. A further \u20ac100bn is available for bank buyouts, interbank lending and bank bond issuance guarantees. </p> <p>Naked short-selling has been banned. Any short positions exceeding 0.25% of a stock's market capitalisation must be disclosed.</p> <h2>Austria</h2> <p>The government has made \u20ac85bn available to underwrite bank lending. There is also an unlimited guarantee on bank deposits. A further \u20ac15bn has been used for recapitalisation.</p> <p>Short-selling beyond a certain amount is seen as market manipulation or insider trading.</p> <h2>Belgium</h2> <p>Another country with highly exposed banks, Belgium announced it would guarantee all new financing of banks for one year.</p> <p>There has been an injection of \u20ac4.7bn for 49% of faltering Fortis, with the remaining assets of the bank to be taken over by BNP Paribas.</p> <h2>The Netherlands</h2> <p>ING, the largest listed Dutch bank, with 85 million customers worldwide and more than a million savers in the UK, is to get a \u20ac10bn capital injection from the authorities in exchange for preference shares. Naked short-selling has been banned in eight financial institutions.</p> <h2>Portugal</h2> <p>Portugal has offered a financing line worth \u20ac20bn to guarantee the liquidity of its banks. </p> <p>The money offered is 11.7% of the country's gross domestic product and is backed by the Bank of Portugal.</p> <p>Short-selling in eight banks listed on the Euronext Lisbon is banned.</p> <h2>Sweden</h2> <p>The government outlined a $205bn plan including credit guarantees and a bail-out fund. Sweden has said its banking system is solid.</p> <p>Sweden joined other central banks in cutting interest rates earlier this month.</p> <h2>Finland</h2> <p>Finland has made clear it will take action if needed but insisted capital injections were not being considered.</p> <p>Peter Nyberg at the finance ministry said there were no contagion effects from Iceland, and Finnish banks were not active in the US sub-prime market.</p> <p>Deposit guarantees have been doubled to the new EU-recommended minimum of \u20ac50,000.</p> <h2>Switzerland</h2> <p>The government has offered UBS $54bn so that it can clear out bad securities from its books. Switzerland's largest bank will also receive $6bn from the government in return for mandatory convertible bonds.</p> <p>The package includes raising account holder protection for customers in all Swiss banks above the current threshold of $26,250.</p> <p>The central bank also took part in the coordinated rate cut. Switzerland has banned naked short-selling.</p> <h2>Poland</h2> <p>The government adopted plans to guarantee bank deposits up to \u20ac50,000, while the central bank is due to announce a rescue package for the banking system. </p> <p>The government is prepared to inject new funds into banks if needed and the central bank has endorsed the use of currency swaps to boost interbank liquidity.</p> <p>The financial regulator is preparing rules requiring borrowers to put up 30% of a property's value for mortgages.</p> <h2>Hungary</h2> <p>Hungary's central bank is due to announce a rescue package with the help of the International Monetary Fund. However, the government has said this will be a last resort.</p> <p>It has also agreed to guarantee all bank deposits with no limits. </p> <p>Regulations on pension fund investments have been relaxed, tax cut plans scrapped and the central bank has agreed with the ECB on repurchase transactions, which will allow it to borrow up to \u20ac5bn to boost liquidity. </p> <h2>Czech Republic</h2> <p>The Czechs have been largely sheltered from the global economic crisis and reluctantly signed up to the EU plan to raise bank deposit insurance to \u20ac50,000. They plan no further action to prop up lenders.</p> <p>The central bank has introduced a new facility to revive the bond market by taking state bonds as collateral against liquidity provided to banks.</p> <h2>Romania</h2> <p>Romania's government has raised its bank deposit guarantee for individual savers to \u20ac50,000 from \u20ac20,000.</p> <p>The central bank says the financial sector had stayed clear of high-risk derivatives and liquidity is ample, largely because of the bank's high minimum reserve requirements.</p> <p>It has said it will inject funds if needed.</p> <h2>Slovakia</h2> <p>The government and the central bank say the banking sector is sound and stable. As a future eurozone member, Slovakia follows technical steps taken by the ECB, including a planned relaxation of collateral rules to make it easier for banks to refinance.</p> <p>The government has approved a plan, which must be approved by parliament, to guarantee 100% of bank deposits. It is also ready to inject capital into banks in exchange for stakes.</p> <h2>Bulgaria </h2> <p>The government has said it might tap its fiscal reserve of $8.13bn if needed but has reiterated that Bulgarian banks are stable and well-capitalised for now.</p> <p>Last week, the government decided to make legal amendments to increase the minimum bank deposit guarantee to \u20ac50,000.</p> <h2>Norway</h2> <p>Norway will lend $55bn to four Norwegian commercial banks in government bonds, in return for distressed mortgage assets as collateral for periods of up to three years. </p> <p>The government has stressed that Norwegian banks have virtually no exposure to the US sub-prime market and rely on depositors rather than wholesale markets for funding.</p> <h2>Ukraine</h2> <p>Several packages, each worth about $300m, have been offered to help banks. It announced a six-month freeze in October on early withdrawals of all bank deposits.</p> <h2>Japan</h2> <p>Japan has signalled a willingness to broaden its bank bail-out scheme to the country's biggest banks. But as Japanese banks have avoided risky credit products, they remain relatively well capitalised and Japanese money markets have been functioning even when major markets in the United States and Europe seized up.</p> <h2>China</h2> <p>China joined coordinated action by the world's central banks for the first time by cutting interest rates by 0.27 percentage points.</p> <p>The proportion of deposits that banks must hold in reserve has been reduced by half a percentage point and a tax of 5% levied on interest income has been waived.</p> <p>Short-selling was already banned.</p> <h2>India</h2> <p>Money for its dried-up markets has been pledged and cash reserve requirements have been slashed by 150 basis points to 7.5%, releasing about $12bn into the banking system.</p> <h2>Singapore</h2> <p>Singapore's central bank has shifted its foreign exchange rate policy to try to boost the competitiveness of the country's exports. The export-reliant economy has been hit by the global downturn, pushing it into recession.</p> <p>Policymakers have also boosted guarantees for depositors. Similar action was taken in Hong Kong and Bahrain.</p> <h2>South Korea</h2> <p>The South Korean government is offering banks $30bn of fresh liquidity, plus loan guarantees totalling $100bn.</p> <p>The move came just days after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's put the country's five biggest banks on a ratings watch because the South Korean won has fallen by a third against other currencies since January.</p> <p>Interest rates have been cut by a quarter point. Short-selling of local stocks has been banned.</p> <h2>Indonesia</h2> <p>The government has made $420m available for state-owned enterprises to buy back their shares. </p> <p>One of the hardest hit during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago, Indonesia has raised the guarantee on bank deposits to $200,000 and made it easier to flood tight money markets with funds.</p> <p>The stockmarket was closed for three days and a 10% limit imposed on price swings.</p> <h2>Qatar</h2> <p>Launched a $5.3bn plan to purchase shares in its listed banks.</p> <h2>Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>The lending rate has been cut by half a percentage point and $40bn has been made available to banks if needed.</p> <h2>United Arab Emirates</h2> <p>The government has guaranteed its bank deposits and is pumping $19bn of emergency funds into the sector. That brings the total funds the UAE has devoted to its banks to fend off the financial crisis to $32.7bn. </p> <p>The government has said it will inject as much liquidity as necessary. </p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>Australia reduced rates by a whole percentage point. The government guaranteed all bank deposits up to A$700bn (\u00a3275bn) for three years and took measures to make it easier for central banks to pump funds into tight money markets \u2013 a measure also taken by New Zealand.</p> <p>A A$10.4bn fiscal stimulus package to bolster the economy has also been unveiled, equivalent to 1% of GDP.</p> <h2>United States</h2> <p>The largest government intervention in decades saw a $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out of the banking industry. The limit of a federal guarantee on bank deposits was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 until the end of 2009. There are unlimited guarantees on deposits in accounts that do not give interest.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve joined other central banks around the world in cutting interest rates by half a point to 1.5%.</p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p>Canada, which joined other central banks in cutting interest rates by half a point, is expected to announce further measures soon.</p> <p>Short-selling has been temporarily banned in 13 financial companies.<br></p>",
  "<p>Mea culpa, mea culpa. I've only just had the chance to review the incredible - and I really mean <em>incredible</em> - entries which the gamesblog massive submitted for our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2008/oct/06/games.competition\">Spore evolutionary game design competition</a>, and dang are they awesome.</p> <p>But while we got a bumper 24 entries from budding designers inspired by our evolutionary theme, we were sadly only able to choose five people to win a copy of Will Wright's newest sim. And the five winners are:</p> <p><strong>Luke Morrow</strong> for Germs<br><strong>Andrew Ireson</strong> for The Gaia Game<br><strong>Matthew Ruigrok</strong> for Pumpkin Harvester<br><strong>John 'Killerbee' Kilbey</strong> for Race of Life<br><strong>Geoff Burgess</strong> for his first person shooter</p> <p>Keep reading for full details, and prepare to be amazed. Congrats as well to everyone who submitted; it was a tough decision and our crack team of gamesbloggers and game designers spent quite some time debating the final five.<br><br><strong>Luke Morrow</strong> for Germs</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Evolve you germs and dominate the world<br> <br>(Stage 1)<br>You start of as a single bad germ inside a human body .Your job is to survive and multiply your colony of germs and fight of good bacteria trying to stop you. The stage lasts until the human develops a cough, when this happens part of the your colony of germs is coughed out onto the humans hand.<br> <br>(Stage 2) (Time trial)<br>This stage is more challenging as you have to make it to a surface or object before the human can wash his hands! You can either leap to a surface guided by the wind or when the human touches a surface move directly onto it.<br> <br>(Stage 3)<br>There will be optional surfaces each with there own benefits e.g. door handle will be small but will come into contact with many humans, the kitchen sink will be larger with more chances to grow but there will be a higher risk of being attacked by good bacteria i.e. soap! Once you make it onto a new surface or object its time to start evolving into a stronger and more dangerous germ colony! Relying on environmental conditions e.g. other liquids mixing with your germs, food crumbs, other germs that you can join up with and form a super germ colony and most importantly temperature. Having taken over the object/surface completely, grown in strength and numbers,You will have achieved Virus status! The game then develops, suddenly something falls from the sky into your germ world, a huge \u00a310 note! having used all the resources available your germs infest the \u00a310 note (possibly time trial) just seconds from it being picked up and put into the humans wallet.<br> <br>(Stage 5)<br>This is were the game switches to world infestation mode.<br>Since moving onto the \u00a310 note the super virus germ colony is now in your control as you try and spread the virus from the \u00a310 note into supermarkets and banks and global companies until there is a global epidemic in which the humans do not know how to cure!<br>You are now the King germ, you are the most evolved germ there is. You are no longer a microscopic liquid based life form, you are now a tiny being with arms and legs with a lot of aggression to be unleashed apon the human race! Now decided if you want to sell the cure to the humans or enslave them forever with illness!<br> <br>You Decide.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Andrew Ireson</strong> for The Gaia Game</p> <blockquote> <p><br>In this game you start by terraforming an initially \"dead\" planet, creating an atmosphere that can sustain life. However, the planet goes through cycles of ice-ages, meteor strikes, deadly volcanic erruptions and tsunamis, meaning that all higher life forms suffer routine extinctions. The challenge is to evolve intelligent life which can develop the means to escape the planet before the next extinction. However, as more intelligent species develop, so their activities have an ever more dramatic impact on Gaia's natural cycles, which may be benefitial or determental. Its a race between evolution and Gaia's lifecycle. The species that escapes the planet successfully can then go on to colonise another planet, and the process repeats.</p> <p>You control a team of human scientists who arrive on the planet on a spaceship, and live in a small self-sustaining bio-dome. Your team and their descendants are thus immune from the earlier existinctions. You control the activities of the scientists, who must find ways of modifying the planets atmosphere, temperature, hydrology and ultimately biology.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matthew Ruigrok</strong> for Pumpkin Harvester</p> <blockquote> <p><br>Summary - Have you got green fingered aspirations, but don't want to get muddy feet?

Use awards and money to unlock new pumpkin attributes/equipment/growing capabilities. Carve Jack O Lanterns with your own pumpkins, make soup or throw them off tall buildings.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>John 'Killerbee' Kilbey</strong> for Race of Life</p> <blockquote> <p><br>What: The aim of the game is to grow your tree faster than your rivals. You start off as a tiny sapling on the forest floor and must race against competing trees / plants and other hazards to grow through various stages of growth and development.<br> <br>What you do: Playing like a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up, you have to guide your sapling's growth upwards through the big bad rainforest.<br> <br>Rival trees are constantly springing up and will chase after you in pursuit of the sunlight (at the top of the level), so keeping your speed up by staying ahead of rival vegetation is the core facet to the gameplay.<br> <br>Along the way, you'll encounter all sorts of wildlife that will try to land on your tree and slow your progress. Initially you'll encounter small insects, but as your tree gets bigger, birds, squirrels and even monkeys will clamber onto your tree, weighing you down and hindering your rate of ascent. You can fend off invading animals by firing seeds, nuts and fruit at them.<br> <br>\"Lives\" take the form of different branches for your tree \u2013 if one gets overwhelmed by rival trees, play switches to another branch until your tree is \"dead\". On completion of each level, you \"level up\" by growing an extra branch (extra life) or trade that for a strength or speed bonus to help you through the next level.<br> <br>Power ups come via raindrops which fall down and will give you key bonuses if you can catch them:<br>- \"Leaf me alone!\" - sprout a leaf to either side of your stem/branch to put an obstacle in the way of pursuing plants, slowing them down;<br>- \"Lord of the Rings\" - add another ring to your trunk: this increases your strength and reduces the negative effects of wildlife landing on you;<br>- \"Audrey II\" \u2013 evolve a carnivorous flower to eat the invading insects and animals. Complete with a funky song, natch.<br>- \"Miracle Gro!\" \u2013 a speed-enhancing drug. Beware: this could see you banned from the Gro-lympics for life.<br> <br>In true shoot 'em up fashion, the aim of the game is to get the highest tree (score) possible!<br> </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Geoff Burgess</strong> for his first person shooter</p> <blockquote> <p><br>A first-person shooter in which all the enemies evolve against you. Day and night cycles represent multi-generational evolutionary leaps, as surviving monsters cross-breed to mingle attributes.</p> <p>In the day cycle monsters jump, fly, swim and crawl over the landscape towards you: You blast them as best you can.</p> <p>In the night cycle the survivors interbreed, taking characteristics from each parent (and additional random mutations): the resultant generation attacking the next day. The new monsters may not be able to walk but will have huge teeth; they may fly right at you but be unable to inflict damage. The key factor is that their parents are the ones you allowed to live; the ones you couldn't kill.</p> <p>For example: If you aren't good at water sections and close-combat, the next generation will be sharp-clawed swimmers. Every game different. One player against an evolving horde.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>A family emergency interrupted Barack Obama's quest for the presidency yesterday, when the Democratic candidate announced he was leaving the campaign trail to visit his ailing grandmother in Hawaii.</p> <p>A campaign spokesman said Obama's 85-year-old grandmother Madelyn Dunham had taken ill, and described her condition as \"very serious\". The spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said Obama will cancel campaign events later this week to return to Hawaii. He declined to give details of her illness but said it had deteriorated in recent weeks and was serious enough for the Illinois senator to make the more than 10-hour long flight to Honolulu.</p> <p>Dunham, whom Obama as a child called Tutu, Hawaiian for grandparent, helped raise Obama after his father abandoned the family and while his mother was busy with her studies and career. She hails from a small town in Kansas and moved with Obama's grandfather Stanley Dunham and mother to Hawaii in 1959, where his grandfather entered the home furniture business.</p> <p>Gibbs said Dunham \"has always been one of the most important people in [Barack Obama's] life.\"</p> <p>At the Democratic convention in August, Obama said of his grandmother: \"She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me.\"</p> <p>Dunham has not appeared on the campaign trail, and Obama has said she is too frail to travel but follows the campaign on television. In late August, Obama and his family took a brief holiday in Hawaii to visit her. Obama's parents and maternal grandfather are no longer living. His paternal grandmother lives in a village in Kenya.</p> <p>Obama is scheduled to campaign in Florida today and in Virginia on Wednesday. The campaign cancelled Thursday rallies in Madison, Wisconsin and Des Moines, Iowa, but will hold an event in Indianapolis on Thursday before Obama flies to Hawaii. He is scheduled to return to the campaign trail on Saturday.</p> <p>This is not the first time a family emergency has interrupted the Democratic campaign. Vice-presidential candidate Joe Biden's mother-in-law passed away earlier this month, and Biden suspended campaign activity for two days.</p> <p>It is unclear how the time away from the campaign trail will affect the dynamics of the race. Obama leads in polling in Wisconsin and Iowa, and is ahead nationally and in several key battleground states.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 21 2008. The Hawaiian word for grandmother is Tutu, not 'Toot' as we had it in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
