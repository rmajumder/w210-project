  "<p>Football changes with every passing season, unless you happen to be watching the early stages of the Champions League, in which case it looks so exactly the same. You begin to wonder whether you just dreamt the past 12 months after falling asleep during the second half of the Manchester United match. </p> <p>The big change this season is that managers are now about as important as club mascots. OK, Sir Alex Ferguson is still doing things his way after 22 years, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger remains untouchable and Luiz Felipe Scolari looks like an ideal successor to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Chelsea. But Rafa Ben\u00edtez had his wings clipped by his owners during the summer transfer window and he's one of the lucky ones. He's in the Champions League and still in a job. The increasing tendency of transfer windows to act as gauges to check the true level of a board's support for a manager resulted in the exits of Kevin Keegan and Alan Curbishley before the season had properly started, and then Tottenham contrived to hit the bottom of the table barely a year after securing the services of one of the most highly rated managers in Europe. </p> <p>The reason is all too straightforward, as Juande Ramos has hinted. Managers are not required to manage any more, they are just employed to look confident and in control while players are being sold under their noses without being adequately replaced. Doubtless Ramos is still a good manager and will do his best to reverse the trend from silk purse to sow's ear, but no manager in the world could be expected to sanction the sale of three goalscorers - Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane and Dimitar Berbatov - while getting in return a single Russian striker who will need time to adapt. Similarly Spurs sold Steed Malbranque, not only a fine midfield player but a case-hardened Premier League performer, and brought in the talented though delicate Luka Modric and have been playing David Bentley out of position. Now their supporters are complaining the team looks lightweight. They could have their work cut out against Steve Bruce's pie monsters this afternoon. </p> <p>Should the unthinkable happen and Spurs lose another match to unfancied opposition, the pressure on Ramos will be intensified and the fate of Martin Jol last season recalled. Yet it was not the manager's idea to keep hold of Berbatov until the last day of the transfer window, bumping up the price with the aid of Manchester City's unexpected interest but simultaneously running out of time to bring in a replacement. Spurs had all summer to sell Berbatov. They knew United wanted him, knew the player wanted to go, and knew all along that they would trade. The rest was simply about the price, and if the price includes a wholly unbargained-for visit to the relegation end of the table in addition to a few more quid in the bank account, then Spurs as sellers played their hand poorly. </p> <p>Leaving aside the unfairness to supporters and season-ticket holders of selling a star name a fortnight into a new season - no one ever considers spectators any more, even managers are royalty compared to the poor saps who pay to watch - Spurs effectively cut off their nose to spite their face. United could easily afford the extra millions for Berbatov, while Spurs plainly cannot afford to leave themselves light on strikers for the first four months of the season.</p> <p>Perhaps they saw what United did with Cristiano Ronaldo and felt they, too, would not be pushed around. But Ronaldo is younger than Berbatov and tied to a much bigger contract at the club where he made his name. United are champions of Europe and can offer Champions League football every year. Spurs cannot and, after initially making his mark in the Champions League with Bayer Leverkusen, Berbatov had reached a stage in his career where he knew, as did everybody else, that offers from blue-chip Champions League clubs would not be coming along indefinitely. </p> <p>Spurs know exactly how the business works. They succeeded in signing Bentley from Blackburn despite Paul Ince's ostensible claims that the player was going nowhere, and when Berbatov began talking of United as his dream move they should have seen the writing on the wall. Ronaldo talked of a possible move to Real Madrid in similar terms, though United can make a fairly compelling case at the moment for being bigger than Real Madrid. 'We were in the right position to dismiss Real Madrid,' Ferguson has just said. Spurs are demonstrably not bigger than United. They needed to recognise their place in the food chain and act accordingly and decisively. Had United been forced to sell Ronaldo against their will, they would have not waited until the last day of the transfer window. Ferguson would have been wanting to spend the money much earlier than that. Ramos, one can only assume, simply didn't have a say. </p> <p>The moral of the story is simple. If clubs such as Spurs, West Ham and Newcastle are going to emasculate managers with continental models of scouting, signing and selling players, all the new football directors and deal-makers are going to have to get their act together and stop making such a hash if things. Otherwise the managers will be sacked. It's all very well saying Damien Comolli or Dennis Wise should pay the price for poor performances, but what changes if they do? How does it get the team up the table? Conventional football wisdom states that it is always easier to sack the manager than the board or the players, logic that looks likely to survive the advent of football directors. They may be even easier to sack, but the new guy can't change a thing until the next transfer window.<br><strong><br>FA quite wrong to make Terry right</strong></p> <p>Cameras lie all the time - one only has to watch television or flick through a fashion magazine to understand that - though occasionally the photographic image can be an instrument of absolute truth.</p> <p>I was at Manchester City v Chelsea last weekend and like most people thought John Terry had grounds for complaint over his dismissal because the referee seemed to err in thinking he was the last defender.</p> <p>Then came the photographs, revealing what Mark Halsey saw. They showed Terry making a rugby tackle without even a pretence of playing the ball and even caught his resigned, almost apologetic expression. It was the clearest case of a professional foul since Willie Young was at large, yet precisely because of rules aimed at stamping out such cynical challenges Terry and his club were able to claim with impunity that the defender was within his rights and should have stayed on the field.</p> <p>The problem is that in seeking to define a professional foul the authorities have arrived at a situation whereby only the last defender is deemed capable of one. To judge from the past few days, as long as you have a covering defender somewhere in the vicinity you can behave as cynically as you like. But J\u00f4 was denied a goalscoring opportunity by Terry - if the covering defenders had been as handily placed as his apologists would have us believe, there would have been no need to bring him down in the first place - and there was no adequate sanction the referee could apply. Halsey was never going to make a charge of violent conduct or serious foul play stick, yet as he has discovered to his cost an instinct to punish a cynical challenge with a straight red is not supported by the rule book.</p> <p>This loophole needs looking at, before others realise what is now permissible within the rules and begin to copy it. A dodgy precedent has been set. The FA's Respect agenda will not last long when the England captain is seen to be flouting the rules and profiting by his actions. J\u00f4 might not have scored at Eastlands had Terry let him past, but there is a strong probability that he would have. Certainly Terry must have thought so, and that is a useful Catch 22 to apply. Had the Chelsea player merely mistimed his tackle it would be another matter, but he didn't even attempt a tackle. He denied a goalscoring opportunity by illegal means and successfully argued - albeit in retrospect - that he was entitled to do so. That simply cannot be right. </p> <p><strong>Fit and proper people don't need a test</strong></p> <p>The Premier League are seeking help from the government on how to frame rules to screen out potential football club owners who might not pass the 'fit and proper persons' test. The difficulty the League face is that your average multi-billionaire does not place his business history and banking details on a handy website, and tracing ownership records through offshore accounts and deliberately obscure holding companies is a tough task even for dedicated professionals.</p> <p>The irony here is that someone who has made squillions without attracting undue attention to himself, all the while covering his tracks to keep his gains safe from prying eyes, would probably be quite good at both running a football club and staying in the background. Whereas a maverick though essentially mainstream discount trader like Mike Ashley, who would have sailed through any 'fit and proper persons' test, has been a calamity on both counts.</p>",
  "<p>Rarely is a Secretary of State ignored at an evening reception. More rarely still do union power brokers turn their backs on a Labour cabinet minister whose portfolio is business and industry.</p> <p>But, when John Hutton was mingling with MPs and senior union leaders at the TUC conference this month, it was obvious that the most pro-business member of the cabinet, other than perhaps the Prime Minister, was unwelcome.</p> <p>But it's not just business and unions at loggerheads. Among the many consequences arising from the dramatic destruction of totemic Western banks is a political watershed: the official separation of Labour from the City and business - never the easiest of bedfellows. </p> <p>With its donations from the City all but dried up and surviving on handouts from unions, Labour is groping towards formulating new ways to manage financial services and the economy.</p> <p>MP Jon Cruddas, champion of grassroots Labour activists and a possible leadership contender, said: 'You are getting Martin Wolf in the FT, Anatole Kaletsky in the Times and Will Hutton in The Observer saying an era of neo-libereralism - the genuflection to the market - has come to a halt. We celebrated ever more consumption and the celebrity culture. All of that has been part of Labour.'</p> <p>There are signs of a grouping emerging across parties and embracing academics and unions to articulate new positions. Co-ordinated by Neal Lawson, chair of Compass, the soft-left Labour campaign group, a convention aims to thrash out a new plan for the City. It is expected to lead to hard policy positions on City regulation, windfall taxation, alternative tax regimes and tax haven abuse.</p> <p>To many Labour policymakers the acceptance of so-called neo-liberal orthodoxies, allowing the free movement of capital as the most efficient way of generating prosperity, have been made to look hollow. Mark Hanson, a key figure behind Labour Home, an influential blog, says: 'There were two reasons Labour courted the City. First, if you did that you'd get lots of friends and second, you'd get donations. Today we've got no donations and capitalism is not having a good time. There are no votes in it.'</p> <p>New Labour and the City's coupling was a reaction to the savaging given to John Smith's shadow Budget on the eve of the lost 1992 election, despite his 'prawn cocktail offensive' to charm the boardrooms. On taking control of the party, Blair and Brown relentlessly toured the Square Mile, where Blair's reassuring presence and relaxed attitude to conspicuous consumption, a contrast to Smith's suspected disapproval, disarmed and reassured potential enemies.</p> <p>New supporters included Sir Ronald Cohen, founding father of the private equity movement in the UK, and another private equity tycoon, Nigel Doughty. Both contributed millions to party coffers and bought access to other high rollers. Gordon Brown's and Ed Balls's devoted championing of the financial services sector won them support from the likes of Damon Buffini, the Permira chairman. Even Ken Livingstone, the one-time left-wing firebrand, encouraged banks' growth in London while he was mayor. 'This was not the world I created,' he says. 'It is the one I had to live in.'</p> <p>City businesses made efforts to fund Labour-leaning think-tanks. The Institute for Public Policy Research and the Social Market Foundation's key public services policy forums have received cash from PWC, KPMG, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Standard Life Healthcare and Barclays. The result, directly or indirectly, has been the wholesale opening-up of public sector provision to private firms, now estimated to be a \u00a379bn industry.</p> <p>The New Labour project was complete when bankers such as Baroness Shriti Vadera, a Warburg banker, and Sir James Sassoon, from UBS, left their high-powered jobs to drive through Labour's social and economic policy.</p> <p>Vadera bulldozed through the controversial Public Private Partnership (PPP) financing of the \u00a316bn London underground modernisation programme, despite strong public opposition. She was also involved in the effective renationalisation of the malfunctioning Railtrack. Recently, as business minister, Vadera has been at the heart of negotiations over the sale of British Energy to EDF and was charged with securing an energy windfall tax from power firms. In this she failed, a sign perhaps that Labour's power of persuasion with big business is ebbing.</p> <p>Sassoon was responsible for promoting PPP across Whitehall, as well as being the government's link man with the City. But, in another blow to Brown's battered administration, Sassoon quit Downing Street two weeks ago. Friends suggest he had become disillusioned with the Prime Minister's performance.</p> <p>But the door from the City to the heart of government has not been shut altogether. Insiders at the HM Revenue &amp; Customs were surprised when Mike Clasper, who worked for Guy Hands' private equity vehicle, Terra Firma, and made his name at BAA, was this year appointed chairman of the Revenue. </p> <p>With unimaginable profits, the City has thrived under Labour. Inadequate regulators failed to penetrate serial insider trading, spot the development of complicated and devastating financial instruments and gave financial institutions the right to leverage balance sheets to unsustainable levels. </p> <p>The huge wealth enjoyed by traders and financiers - taxed at a lower level as capital gains, not income - was said to create jobs in the service economy, drive up house prices and create a rising tide of wealth. Now the mainstream Labour party seems to be having a moment akin to the morning after a drunken night out, mumbling: 'How did that happen?'</p> <p>But just as Labour grapples with regulating the City, it seems likely that the reins of power will be seized by the Conservatives, bankrolled by hedge-fund managers, spread-betting tycoons and blue-blooded Tory bankers. It could soon be political business as usual.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Varjak Paw</strong> <br>Linbury Studio, London WC2, Thur-Sun, then touring </p> <p><strong>La Fanciulla del West</strong> <br>Royal Opera House, London WC2, tomorrow to Sept 29 </p> <p>Opera for children seems a contradiction in terms. My own offspring, when younger, either enjoyed operas or didn't, in much the same way as their adult escorts. Their response depended as much on the music and the staging as the subject matter - which could prove counterproductive if tailored for children. Some thrillingly scored, well-directed sex and violence - as in, say, Mozart's Don Giovanni - was much more likely to stop them fidgeting than cutesy fables about anthropomorphic cats. Hasn't Lloyd Webber already cornered that market? </p> <p>Such are the problems of <strong>Varjak Paw</strong>. Adapted from two children's stories by SF Said, about a kitten let loose on the streets of the big, bad city, it tries too hard to stay grown-up while keeping the little ones happy, and winds up getting lost somewhere up its own back alley. As a complex, over-populated plot unfolds, too few of Kit Hesketh-Harvey's words can be heard through Julian Philips's ornate orchestration and angular vocal lines. Surtitles - yes, above the opera in English - would help. </p> <p>But why not settle for some spoken dialogue? If it was good enough for Mozart in The Magic Flute, the supreme example of an opera that appeals equally to adults and children, surely it would help today's youngsters and their parents through the vicissitudes of Varjak's urban voyage. The show's frequent changes of character and scenario are less than clear in John Fulljames's staging, despite ravishing visuals from designer Rhys Jarman. With its computer-generated backdrops and broadly accessible score, Varjak Paw comes across as a low-budget version of Albarn-Hewlett's Monkey - but about cats, the chief among whom is charmingly played by Akiya Henry, whose throat infection on the first night saw the role gamely sung from the side of the stage by Natalie Raybould. </p> <p>Children would certainly enjoy Covent Garden's latest revival of <strong>La Fanciulla del West</strong>, Puccini's love-triangle western featuring drunken saloon-bar punch-ups, crooked log-cabin poker and a thwarted lynching by gun-toting Italian cowboys who keep complaining that they miss their mummies. Unusually for Puccini, what's more, it all ends happily, with the opera's sole female character, Minnie, exiting happily into the sunset with her two-timing bandit, Dick Johnson.</p> <p>Minnie is the problem character who has denied this piece a more secure place in the repertoire: a saloon-owning, heart-breaking Annie Oakley-type tough gal who has never kissed a man and says her prayers before getting into a different bed from her lover. But she is so well acted and sung by Eva-Maria Westbroek, with predictably strong support from Jos\u00e9 Cura as Dick, that the evening flies by even with two long set-change intervals. Despite some operatic overacting, especially in the lesser roles, Piero Faggioni's legendary 1977 staging looks as glorious as ever, though it is probably time for its sole surviving cast member, Silvano Carroli's Sheriff Rance, to hang up his spurs. The crowning glory of the evening is Antonio Pappano's conducting, which lovingly realises the multicoloured splendours of Puccini's high-cholesterol score.</p>",
  "<p>Politicians on both sides of the Atlantic will be watching the markets anxiously tomorrow, amid fears that the euphoria that greeted Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's plan to rescue American banks will give way to a renewed slump in the price of shares.</p> <p>Paulson spent the weekend urging Congress to authorise his daring bail-out, while Democrats called for extra help for poor households.</p> <p>After a calamitous week in which the fallout from the bankruptcy of venerable Wall Street broker Lehman Brothers threatened to drag down a clutch of other banks, Paulson announced that he wants to use $700bn (\u00a3380bn) of taxpayers' money to buy up toxic mortgage assets, in an attempt to avert full-blown financial meltdown. Speaking at the White House yesterday, George Bush said: 'This is a big package because it was a big problem.'</p> <p>Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama echoed calls for the bail-out package to avoid helping highly paid bank bosses.</p> <p>But analysts are not convinced that Washington's decisive actions will mark an end to the credit crunch. 'On balance, market developments and policy responses are still netting out to a very uncertain path for financial conditions and the economy,' warned Robert DiClemente, of Citigroup.</p> <p>British banks will not benefit directly, and Alistair Darling is under pressure to provide more help to crisis-hit lenders. But after the hastily arranged marriage of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, regulators hope the US plan will begin to restore investors' shattered confidence and give banks a breathing space. Treasury sources insisted that Darling has no intention of adopting a copycat scheme.</p> <p>As calls intensified for Gordon Brown to follow up on his promise to 'clean up' the City with concrete plans for stricter legislation, details emerged of widespread fraud among some of Britain's biggest lenders. Ten banks and building societies have called in the police to investigate systemic and sophisticated mortgage fraud worth more than \u00a360m, The Observer has discovered.</p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley alone has written off \u00a315m to criminal gangs who organised frauds involving applications from dishonest or bogus borrowers. Police believe a number of shady brokers and solicitors overstated the value of a large number of houses. The disclosure will raise fears that there are other multi-million pound losses from mortgage fraud yet to be declared by banks and building societies which could affect their stability and balance sheets. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Financial Services Authority, the City's watchdog, confirmed that it is investigating around 300 cases of suspected mortgage fraud. Of those, at least 10, each worth at least \u00a35m, have been referred to the police. </p> <p>Details of one of the frauds have been leaked to The Observer. Bradford &amp; Bingley was stung by a \u00a315m mortgage fraud centred on newly built properties in Surrey, Hampshire and East Sussex. Hundreds of buy-to-let mortgage applications were submitted by a single gang between 2004 and 2007 from fake borrowers and dishonest appraisers. </p> <p>A source close to the bank said its executives were horrified to learn of the fraud at the beginning of this year. 'It was well organised and involved a large number of people. The scam involved newly-built estates and multiple applications for mortgages from \"straw borrowers\". The gang worked with solicitors, surveyors and estate agents who knew exactly what was going on. It slipped through at a time when staff were still being encouraged to sign off buy-to-let mortgages.'</p>",
  "<p>Small companies hoping to cash in on the London Olympics are being warned they face a 'time bomb' in the run-up to the 2012 Games because so few of them understand the advertising perils surrounding the event.</p> <p>Under the 2006 London Olympic Games and Paralympics Games Act, normally innocuous words such as 'Game', 'Medals', 'Gold', '2012' and 'Summer' cannot be combined in any form of advertising around the Olympics, with anyone flouting the law facing a fine of up to \u00a320,000.</p> <p>But the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the international body for marketing and business development, says few marketers appreciate the constraints of the legislation and face 'a rude awakening' when they discover they have broken the law. </p> <p>In a paper to be published this week the body attacks the act as 'draconian', warning: 'An advertisement for sun tan lotion, for example, with the strapline \"Get bronze in 2012\" would be found to be in contravention of the Listed Expressions element of the Act.'</p> <p>David Thorp, director of research and information at the CIM, said: 'With sponsorship limited to a select few global brands the vast majority of UK plc is likely to miss out.'</p> <p>The legislation is based on that used for the 2000 Sydney Games, created to protect official sponsors' investments, and is a requirement for any Olympic host nation.</p> <p>Ambush marketing, where rival firms not contributing sponsorship hijack others who have, has long been a problem for Olympic authorities.</p> <p>Perhaps the most blatant example of this was when British sprinter Linford Christie, in Atlanta, turned up at an official press conference sporting striking contact lenses bearing the logo of Puma, not official sponsors.</p>",
  "<p>The painted pub sign, one of the oldest popular visual arts traditions in Britain, is locked in decline. That is the fear of conservationists who hope to alert pub chains and breweries to a 'catastrophic' loss of the traditional skills involved and a failure to preserve a heritage that dates back to Roman times.</p> <p>The growing corporate ownership of public houses across the British Isles has led to the standardisation of what is on offer, both inside and outside the bar. The situation has worsened in the past five years because of the increasing number of pub closures. Figures compiled by the Campaign for Real Ale show that an average of 57 pubs shut permanently every month.</p> <p>Campaigning groups such as the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, which once lobbied vigorously on behalf of this dying art, have been taken by surprise by the rate of decline. Only the small Inn Signs Society has charted the sharp fall in newly commissioned painted signs. The society, which has fewer than 400 members, aims to win a Heritage Lottery Fund grant to establish an online archive of material before the tradition disappears.</p> <p>'Like the pub, the inn sign is classless and central to British culture,' argues Tim Minogue in the latest edition of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings' monthly magazine. 'And like the pub, it is acutely vulnerable. Inn signs vary wildly in artistic merit, have no official status or protection, are constantly exposed to the elements and are at risk of theft and vandalism.'</p> <p>Only the 30 independent pub chains and breweries in Britain are still ordering individually painted signs. The St Austell Brewery in Cornwall has a full-time sign painter and the Donnington Brewery at Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire is hanging painted signs at its 16 tied pubs. Whitbread ran a sign-painting studio in Cheltenham until 1991, but has given up brewing and now runs pub restaurant chains such as Brewers Fayre. </p> <p>Inn and tavern names are often of historic significance to an area and yet corporate takeovers have led to the replacement of many with new brand names such as The Rat and Parrot, All Bar One, Pitcher and Piano, or Slug and Lettuce. </p> <p>The first signs outside inns appeared after the Roman invasion when most people were unable to read. A wreath of vine leaves on a pole was the recognised symbol for a hostelry, and this led to images of shrubbery and pub names such as The Bush or The Bunch of Grapes. During the medieval era heraldry and religious symbolism took over: Cross Keys is a reference to St Peter, and the Red Lion may come from the insignia of John of Gaunt, the most prominent public figure in 14th-century England.</p> <p>Minogue looks back nostalgically at the last moment of glory for painted pub signs: in November 1936 the first and last Inn Signs Exhibition was held in London, and 260 iron and timber signs were seen by 18,000 visitors. He quotes too the words of the 61-year-old artist Rob Rowland, who has painted more than 1,000 inn signs in his time. 'What is happening is a great shame,' he says. 'These corporate identities obliterate the historical significance of pubs and detach people from their roots. There are many reasons for the loss of inn signs, but it is all part of a general decline of cultural sensibility.'</p> <h2>Signs of the times</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The earliest 'pub sign' was a wreath of vine leaves, an idea that arrived with the Romans. But as vines are not native, they were replaced by evergreens, trees and shrubs, and eventually painted signs such as The Bush and The Yew Tree.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 1393 King Richard II passed a law making it compulsory for inns to have a sign in order to identify them to the official Ale Taster.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Cheshire Cat at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, is said to be the first to refer to such a creature. It is not clear whether the cheese and dairy products of the area were thought to keep its felines happy. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The name of The Mother Shipton, in Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, comes from the tale of a local woman born in a cave in the 15th century who supposedly foretold the death of Cardinal Wolsey, the Gunpowder Plot, and the invention of aircraft.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Victoria in St Werburghs, Bristol replaced its image of Queen Victoria in 2002 with one of Victoria Beckham - which has now changed to Little Britain's Vicky Pollard.</p>",
  "<p>Borrowers applying for mortgages with HBOS should press ahead and not be deterred by the bank's merger with Lloyds TSB, say experts. </p> <p>Last week borrowers were posting worried messages on personal-finance forums asking whether they should go ahead with their remortgage with the bank, which was taken over by Lloyds for \u00a312.2bn last week after its share price fell 40 per cent in one day. </p> <p>'Borrowers have absolutely no reason to panic,' says Ray Boulger, mortgage expert with broker John Charcol. 'HBOS will continue to honour mortgage promises already made.' </p> <p>David Hollingworth, of mortgage broker London &amp; Country, agrees: 'I do not envisage that HBOS will turn around and say \"we're not going to do this deal any more\" - and if you are an existing borrower, the merger will have no impact on your mortgage at all.'</p> <p>If a lender was running into real difficulties it would be reducing the number of mortgage deals available and putting up its rates, says Boulger - whereas in fact, Halifax, in line with other lenders, cut some of its mortgage rates last weekend. Its new five-year fixed rate, offering a loan of up to 75 per cent of the property value, now has an interest rate of 5.85 per cent with a \u00a3999 fee, down from 6.09 per cent with a \u00a3499 fee the week before. </p> <p>Other lenders were continuing to cut rates last week, despite the new squeeze on liquidity. Woolwich trimmed some of the rates on its tracker products by 0.3 per cent while the Britannia building society announced a number of cuts, including a reduction on its three-year fixed rate from 6.29 per cent to 5.44 per cent. However, it has put up the fee on that deal by \u00a3500 and reduced the loan-to-value (LTV) from 75 per cent to 60 per cent. </p> <p>It also announced that borrowers who opt for its two-year discount tracker, which comes with a rate between 5.79 per cent and 6.59 per cent depending on the size of the loan, will be able to switch to a fixed rate at any time within the two years without paying the associated early repayment charges. </p> <p>This is a facility that a number of mortgage lenders have been introducing in the past few weeks, giving borrowers who are unsure whether to opt for a fixed rate or a tracker product the best of both worlds. Boulger suggests that another option for such borrowers is to opt for a fixed rate with no early redemption penalties. </p> <p>The Coventry building society currently has the best of these, he says. Its three-year fix, available for mortgages with an LTV of 75 per cent or less, offers an interest rate of 5.99 per cent and a \u00a3999 fee. There are no penalties to switch to another deal during that three-year period.</p> <p>'The cheapest fixed rate is currently about 5.54 per cent, so you pay a little extra, but you have bought yourself the freedom to remortgage if cheaper deals become available,' says Boulger. </p> <p>The banking crisis also means that mortgage lenders are taking an increasingly careful look at whom they lend to. Many mortgage lenders, wary of untested borrowers, are switching the emphasis of their lending book away from new business and towards loyal customers. </p> <p>As a result, some lenders are offering cheaper interest-rate deals and lower fees to existing borrowers wishing to remortgage with them than to other banks' customers scanning the marketplace for their next deal.</p> <p>HSBC, for example, waives its \u00a3799 fee on fixed-rate deals and \u00a3499 fee on trackers for existing mortgage holders looking to renew with the bank. And those with HSBC Plus accounts (who pay a \u00a312.95 monthly fee) receive a 0.1 per cent discount on all mortgage rates across the range. Premier account customers (who qualify by earning at least \u00a370,000, having a mortgage of at least \u00a3250,000 or holding investments of at least \u00a350,000) get a 0.2 per cent reduction in rates.</p> <p>'In today's climate the appetite for lending is very different and lenders' credit ethics have changed,' says mortgage specialist Darren Cook of independent financial comparison website Moneyfacts. 'Certainly, borrowers looking to renew with their lender should ask for a reduction in the fee.'</p> <p>Nationwide building society is waiving its \u00a3599 fee for all existing customers looking to remortgage on a two-, three- or five-year fixed deal, and also offering all customers with a loan-to-value ratio of between 60 and 75 per cent the 60 per cent LTV rate, which at the moment is a 0.1 per cent reduction on the building society's 75 per cent LTV remortgage rate. This represents a saving of around \u00a3230 on an average mortgage over the course of a two-year deal.</p> <p>Cook says that, in a traditional housing market, an LTV of 75 per cent was considered the benchmark for safe lending. It allowed lenders to recoup their losses if they had to foreclose even in times of moderate house price downturns. Now, with the housing market so uncertain, some lenders have introduced a new mortgage rate for those with LTVs of just 60 per cent. </p> <p>Louise Cuming, a mortgage expert with comparison site Moneysupermarket.com, said that the advice to borrowers these days would be first to check what the best available deal with their existing lender was. </p> <p>'Many lenders are giving their mortgage staff discretion over whether to waive fees and some may also be allowed limited discretion on the rates they can offer loyal customers. Those who shout the loudest might be getting the best deal,' she said.</p>",
  "<p>Investigators digging into the brutal repression unleashed by General Francisco Franco will this week complete a list of 130,000 names of those killed during and after Spain's civil war as the country prepares to face the full horror of what has often been treated as a shameful national secret.</p> <p>The list will be handed over to the controversial magistrate, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, whose preliminary investigations have already provoked a fierce row over whether a mass grave thought to contain the remains of the poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca should be exhumed.</p> <p>Portuguese Nobel laureate Jos\u00e9 Saramago has become the latest intellectual heavyweight to join the clamour for graves across the country, including that of Lorca, to be opened up so that the victims can be properly identified and their remains handed to relatives.

'We shouldn't be bartering with bodies,' said the novelist Francisco Ayala.</p> <p>The report, due to be handed over this week, will reveal the size of the task ahead for those determined to dig up the graves and break Spain's pact of silence about the violence unleashed against Franco's opponents.</p> <p>Hundreds of mass graves containing an unknown number of bodies are spread across the country. Historians estimate that death squads and kangaroo courts liquidated between 90,000 and 180,000 political opponents during and after Spain's civil war in the late 1930s.</p> <p>Lorca's grave is one of the few to have been identified with any degree of certainty, though there are still doubts about whether the place marked beside an olive tree on a hillside overlooking the southern city of Granada is the right one. The Lorca family's decision to stop fighting a possible exhumation was greeted last week as a sign that the movement to dig up the mass graves had now become unstoppable. </p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has also ordered state bureaucrats and the Roman Catholic church to hand over to investigators all relevant documentation - much of which has been unavailable to historians over most of the past six decades. Doubts still remain, however, about whether Garz\u00f3n can carry the investigation any further. Many of the crimes committed happened so long ago that they are covered by a 1977 amnesty law. </p> <p>The judge has previously used international human rights law to investigate the abuses of Latin American dictatorships and even ordered the arrest of Chile's General Augusto Pinochet in London in 1998. </p> <p>This is the first time, however, that a major Spanish court has acted to investigate crimes committed during the country's civil war.</p>",
  "<p>Outside Lehman Brothers headquarters near Times Square a grim-faced man carrying a yellow placard urged a growing crowd of onlookers to repent their sins and turn to Jesus or prepare to meet the end of the world.</p> <p>For once, the bankers - some of them ex-bankers - passing hurriedly through the revolving glass doors looked like they believed him. Some even took his leaflet and stared at the prediction on the cover with terror.</p> <p>It was a good week for prophets of doom. Not so for bankers. David Z - he declined to give his last name - ignored the religious zealot as he pushed his way through the onlookers on 7th Avenue at 49th Street last Tuesday and stopped to preen himself mockingly before one of the many TV cameras eagerly seeking some hysterical former traders to film.</p> <p>But David was one of the lucky ones who had kept his job, at least for now, and was hopeful that another firm would step in and buy the division that housed his advisory unit. Given that he was not tearing his hair out or screaming his despair to the heavens, most of the media ignored him and looked for better quarry. Had they bothered to talk to him, they would have learnt that there was a growing chance that Barclays of the UK was going to buy much of Lehman's investment banking businesses and that the job losses in New York might be far fewer than the Cassandras expected.</p> <p>They would also have discovered how chaotic it was on Monday inside the Lehman HQ - a glass and steel monstrosity emblazoned with three-storey TV screens displaying 'Lehman' on a hypnotic fiery background. 'Seriously, on Monday morning it was like Bellevue in there,' David said, referring to the notorious New York psychiatric hospital. </p> <p>As workers arrived just hours after the news broke that the Fed would not lend the investment bank a hand but would allow it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, traders were tearing down expensive artwork from the walls.</p> <p>Those with a more profit-focused outlook were selling on eBay whatever they could with the firm's logo on it. There were unverifiable reports of one trader urinating on his PC while screaming obscenities, but the employees I spoke to had only heard about it; no one had seen it happen.</p> <p>But, in a turn of events that could only happen in New York, open-top buses began pulling up outside Lehman depositing their payloads of snap-happy tourists on to the already busy pavement to take pictures of a big tower block.</p> <p>'On your left,' the tour guide intoned through a crackly microphone, 'is the famous Lehman Brothers building', before going on to give an approximate history of the credit crunch. The tourists seemed to love it, in much the same way as peasants used to love a good hanging.</p> <p>But the Lehman collapse was just the first in an endless stream of historic events on Wall Street last week that have brought about the kind of fundamental changes in global finance that come along only once in a lifetime.</p> <p>Almost in lockstep with Lehman's collapse, Merrill Lynch declared an emergency merger with Bank of America. At a stroke, John Thain, the Merrill chief, had mapped out the future for the big beasts of Wall Street, and the once-revered Masters of the Universe who ran them. No more will investment banks be able to afford the existence they had carved out for themselves - an independent and charmed life financed by vast borrowing way beyond their means. </p> <p>Thain basically admitted that Merrill, pregnant with billions of dollars of sub-prime mortgage debt, had to rush to the altar for a shotgun wedding with Bank of America. Perhaps just as importantly, he was admitting that the days of the omnipotent and ego-driven Wall Street chief executive were over, too. Dick Fuld, the CEO of Lehman who allowed the bank to go down the tubes, was perhaps the ultimate example of such a titan.</p> <p>Merrill staff were harder to pin down than Lehman people. But my own financial adviser at the bank, who also declined to be named for fear of breaking company rules, said that the atmosphere was generally calm with everyone grateful the merger had been struck. Most were confident their jobs would be safe because they were the prized New York-based financial advisers that Bank of America in effect bought for $50bn.</p> <p>AIG workers were not so lucky, as the US government stepped in with an $85bn bridging loan in exchange for a 79.9 per cent stake in the insurer. The government is looking for buyers for much of the profitable side of the business to pay the loan back. 'People are happy that the government saved the company from collapsing, but very worried about which divisions will get sold and which might still close down to save money,' the Merrill financial adviser said.</p> <p>As the week wore on, almost every aspect of the Wall Street way of life was changing before our eyes. Share prices of the world's biggest banks were tumbling by 30 and 40 per cent a day, adding up to 50 and 60 per cent in the month alone. This not only exerts immense pressure on the banks themselves - and makes raising money to pay the bills next to impossible - but drains the personal wealth of tens of thousands of bankers down to almost worthless levels. The days of Bonfire of the Vanities-style cocaine binges or driving high-class escorts from the office to the yacht are over - if they ever existed. More prosaically, the huge houses in Westchester, ridiculously expensive rented summer homes in the Hamptons and private schools for the kids may also be at risk.</p> <p>A lot of bankers, traders and financiers are paid their big bonuses in special stock awards. Chief executives and their ilk receive almost all of their massive pay packets in the form of options and restricted stock of some sort. Many invested a great deal of their cash in more stock, so confident were they of making greater and greater returns.</p> <p>All that has come to a jolting halt. Look at Hank Greenberg, the former boss of AIG - indeed, the man who built the vast and complex financial services firm from a small insurance outfit. Analysts reckon he lost $3bn in the course of a couple of days last week. </p> <p>'I've lost literally my entire net worth,' he said. 'I worked 40 years building the greatest insurance company in history, one everyone in the world envied.' He still has his own private jet though, so he must have something stashed away for a rainy day - about $28m by most accounts.</p> <p>As the share price slide continued, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, the last two standalone investment banks, came under pressure to find a partner and join the new order. Goldman pooh-poohed talk of its demise but Morgan opened merger talks with US high-street bank Wachovia, while simultaneously going cap-in-hand to CIC, its Chinese silent partner, looking for cash.</p> <p>But last Thursday night, as regulators and politicians turned on short sellers of financial stocks, blaming them for the week's events, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suddenly leapt more than 400 points. Its biggest gain in six years was fuelled by rumours swirling through the market of yet more government intervention.</p> <p>And then came the biggest number of all, the true grand finale of the week. On Friday morning Hank Paulson called an emergency press conference to announce the biggest US government bailout in history. It will cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars and see all the toxic sub-prime related mortgage debt in the US dumped on the government's shoulders.</p> <p>The taxpayer may be on the hook for as much as half a trillion dollars if this scheme goes ahead - but as Paulson himself warned, the cost will be much greater if we have to endure many more weeks like the past one.</p>",
  "<h2>Why go now?</h2> <p>Autumn's the best season to go surfing, with mild waters but bigger swells - and Newcastle's clean, uncrowded coast is one of the top places in the UK to catch waves. You can shop, take in some culture and check out the city's renowned nightlife, then the next morning, jump on a (fast, clean, efficient) Metro and be on a long sandy beach in less than half an hour. Newcastle/Gateshead continues to stockpile awards recognising its stunning cultural reinvention and dynamism; it's currently up for the European City of the Year Award 2009. </p> <h2>Checking in</h2> <p>For sheer location, it's hard to beat <strong>Malmaison</strong> (Quayside, 0191 245 5000; <a href=\"http://www.malmaison.com\">www.malmaison.com</a>; doubles from \u00a3160), slap bang next to the stunning 'winking eye' Gateshead Millennium Bridge. Its sultry bar has great views down the Tyne, plus there's a petite spa for first-class Espa facials. For the truly decadent, there's the sumptuous penthouse where Kylie stayed in July. More tranquil is <strong>Jesmond Dene House</strong> (Jesmond Dene Rd, 0191 212 3000; <a href=\"http://www.jesmonddenehouse.co.uk\">www.jesmonddenehouse.co.uk</a>; doubles from \u00a3175). Though rather forbidding from the outside - it was once a correctional school for girls - its sunny garden terrace is an elegant spot for evening drinks, the river rushing through the lush green Dene, or valley, below. A brand new <strong>Hotel du Vin</strong> (0845 365 4438; <a href=\"http://www.hotelduvin.com\">www.hotelduvin.com</a>) is due to open on 13 October in the arty Ouseburn Valley area. </p> <h2>Hit the streets</h2> <p>Newcastle's centre is studded with elegant Georgian gems. <strong>Old Eldon Square</strong>'s recent makeover has transformed it into a grassy open space edged with eateries. Stroll down the fabulous, show-stopping curve of Grey Street to the Quayside and see the <strong>Gateshead Millennium Bridge</strong> (which pivots open at noon daily until 28 September) leading from Newcastle to <strong>Gateshead's Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art</strong> (0191 478 1810; <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com\">www.balticmill.com</a>). You'll see the '<strong>New Castle</strong>' built in 1080 by Robert Curthose, son of William the Conqueror, if you come in from the south by train - not to mention Antony Gormley's <strong>Angel of the North</strong>, 10 years old this summer, which is well worth seeing up close (take the Angel bus from Eldon Square bus station; <a href=\"http://www.simplygo.com\">www.simplygo.com</a>). </p> <h2>Coffee break</h2> <p><strong>Caf\u00e9 Royal</strong> on Nelson Street, by the Grade I-listed Grainger Market, bakes its own plump berry and ricotta muffins and gorgeous pecan caramel slices, and the coffee's good too. You'll get a fine espresso at <strong>Intermezzo</strong>, the slim cafe bar beneath Newcastle's fabulous, recently renovated Art Deco independent cinema, the Tyneside. Alternatively, head to West Jesmond, 10 minutes away by Metro, to <strong>Stewart &amp; Co</strong>, a renowned cafe/deli on Brentwood Avenue, that does creamy lattes and huge home-made scones.</p> <h2>Retail therapy</h2> <p><strong>Gateshead's MetroCentre</strong> - Europe's largest indoor shopping centre - is heaving at the weekend. Instead, search out the independent boutiques dotted round the city centre, from fiercely individual <strong>Skirt</strong> (19 Highbridge) to <strong>Attica</strong> (2 Old George Yard), a vintage shop tucked away in an alleyway off Highbridge and <strong>Vivienne Westwood</strong> (1 Hood St). The department store <strong>Fenwick </strong>began in Newcastle in 1882. It remains a family-run business and has a more homely feel than its London counterparts.

For a classic spit and sawdust boozer serving real ale, search out the <strong>Free Trade Inn</strong> (St Lawrence Road) in the Ouseburn Valley area. It's tricky to find, but the views down the Tyne are peerless. <strong>Stereo</strong>, just above the Quayside, has great terraces and local DJs. The string of glam bars around the station area is another good option: <strong>Tokyo</strong> has a pretty fairy-lit garden. <strong>Popolo</strong>, up on Pilgrim Street, with its New York bar vibe and a top line in mojitos, is always packed to the gills, while nearby, <strong>World Headquarters</strong> in Carliol Square prides itself on being the friendliest club in town.</p> <h2>Escape the city</h2> <p><strong>Tynemouth Longsands</strong>, a mere 30 minutes from town, is surfer central (hire your wetsuit and get tuition from <strong>The Tynemouth Surf Co</strong>, just above the beach; \u00a325 for a two-hour beginner lesson; <a href=\"http://www.tynemouthsurf.co.uk\">www.tynemouthsurf.co.uk</a>).

  "<p>How Sunderland must wish they could play Middlesbrough every week. Last season the Black Cats took four points and scored five times against their neighbours from down the A19, not a bad haul considering Roy Keane's men hit the target only 36 times in the campaign.</p> <p>This time around, Boro capitulated despite playing the better football throughout all bar the final 10 minutes, missing several clear-cut chances from open play in the process, not to mention a penalty. Sunderland duly made the most of their stay of execution, with Michael Chopra scoring twice during the closing stages to record a first home win since, you guessed it, Middlesbrough were last on Wearside back in April.</p> <p>'I have been lucky in my three games against them,' Keane said afterwards. 'We beat them here a few months ago and were a bit lucky then, and got a point down there earlier in the season with a goal in the last minute. You need that bit of luck. Craig [Gordon] made some excellent saves, and it could have gone either way. I take my hat off to Middlesbrough. They are a good team. They always have a go.'</p> <p>While Chopra will no doubt get the lion's share of the headlines for his goals, Sunderland's victory, as Keane suggested, was as much down to some fine goalkeeping by Gordon - the Scottish international kept his side in the game with two fine blocks from Afonso Alves and another to deny Stewart Downing.</p> <p>After a lacklustre showing for England against Croatia, the winger was back to something like his best, dictating traffic in the first period as Middlesbrough went in search of a first Premier League away win of 2008. Yet it was his miss from the penalty spot in the 74th minute that led to a sea change in play.</p> <p>The decision was a debatable one, Nyron Nosworthy judged by Howard Webb to have tripped J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re, as the former Arsenal man ran out of room and options on the left hand side of the Sunderland area.</p> <p>Downing had missed a penalty in Middlesbrough's last home game, three weeks ago. On that occasion, against Stoke, he at least managed to hit the crossbar. This one missed by a considerable distance, sailing high over the woodwork into the midst of the away fans. Up went the ball, down went Boro's heads.</p> <p>Seven minutes later, Sunderland took the lead when substitute Chopra advanced on to a through pass from Kieran Richardson to slot the ball past the advancing Ross Turnbull. From looking certainties for at least a point, Middlesbrough were suddenly staring defeat in the face. With no option but to go in search of an equaliser, they left gaps at the back and were punished further in added time. When Daryl Murphy's deflected shot fell into the path of Steed Malbranque, the ex-Spurs player squared for Chopra to tap home.</p> <p>'He had a lifestyle that was questionable,' Keane said of Chopra, who not so long ago appeared surplus to requirements at the Stadium of Light. 'He lost his spark at the end of last season and there was stuff going on off the pitch. But you learn from your mistakes. I know that perhaps more than many. It's good to see him back.'</p> <p>'We didn't take our chances and weren't ruthless enough to see it through and get a point,' Gareth Southgate said. 'We have to react better when events go against us like that. But I can't sit here and slaughter my team because I thought we were excellent. The lessons we took from last week's game we brought into this. We passed well and defended as a team. But when we missed the penalty the whole atmosphere in the stadium changed and they came into it.'</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Phil Wilson, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>I'm happy and relieved. They created the better chances and it was a case of desperate defending from us. The penalty miss saved us - they were totally deflated after that and the momentum changed towards us. Keane has said it is going to take time for all the new players to gel and he's right. Ciss\u00e9 and Diouf were average, while Chimbonda and Malbranque were good. I was impressed with Malbranque in midfield - he's really skilful and can defend as well. Ferdinand was OK, although I would prefer his brother. I'm very optimistic about the season because there's no doubt about it, Keane has bought quality.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Gordon 9; Chimbonda 8, Ferdinand 7, Nosworthy 7, McCartney 7; Malbranque 8, Whitehead 6, Tainio 6 (Chopra 8), Richardson 7, Diouf 6 (Reid 7); Ciss\u00e9 6 (Murphy 6)</p> <p><strong>Steve Goldby, ComeOnBoro.com</strong></p> <p>I'm extremely disappointed. We created enough chances, passed well and defended solidly. But the turning point was the penalty. Once we missed that we fell away and Sunderland took advantage. If Ciss\u00e9 had had his shooting boots on we would have lost by more. I'm a bit worried about our away form - that's three losses out of three, whereas our home record is 100 per cent. I hope that isn't the trend for the season. Southgate has lowered the average age so that our oldest player is Alves at 27, though maybe he's lowered it too much. But we are miles better than last season.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Turnbull 5; Wheater 6, Huth 7, Pogatetz 6, Taylor 6; Aliadi\u00e8re 6, O'Neil 6, Digard 6 (Shawky 5), Johnson 5 (Hoyte 6); Alves 6, Downing 6<br><em><strong><br>To take part in the verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>The Long Gallery in the Palladian west wing of Yorkshire's Castle Howard was conceived by the third Earl of Carlisle in the mid-18th century as a display gallery. It's home to a couple of Rubens, a Reynolds and two colossal da Tivoli landscapes. And today, in the book-lined octagon library that breaks its imposing 160ft length, it's also home to Matthew Goode who is telling an amusing penis anecdote to a roomful of journalists at a press conference for his new film, Brideshead Revisited</p> <p>'It was cold - I think the crew will vouch for me on that,' he says of the day they shot a skinny-dipping scene in Castle Howard's Italianate fountain. His warm, Radio 4 voice fills the room and he folds his long, slim frame over the table in front of him, leaning closer to the avid journalists. 'My teeth were chattering. But it's liberating in a way, saying: \"Hello everyone, this is my cock. I hope we can work with it for the next three hours.\"'</p> <p>The Long Gallery rumbles with laughter, and Goode smiles his very charming, very white smile.</p> <p>It's a bravura performance and, as such, typical of Goode. In his short film career - just five to date - the 30-year-old has made a habit of being better, smarter, funnier and just more memorable than the role requires. He's probably best known as Tom Hewett - Scarlett Johansson's character's rich fianc\u00e9 - in Woody Allen's Match Point. But he was equally menacing and affecting as a low-life American bank robber in The Lookout (2007) with Jeff Daniels, adorably hurt as a deserted husband in Brit comedy Imagine Me And You (2005) and even shone in his 2004 debut Chasing Liberty with US pop star Mandy Moore.</p> <p>But his time distracting attention from the lead actors is over. Goode's next two roles are very big, both in adaptations of revered - if very different - books. Next year he plays Ozymandias in the long-awaited film of Alan Moore's graphic novel Watchmen. But first up is his turn as Charles Ryder in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited. Both are already being scrutinised by legions of fans. Internet messageboards are clogged with discussions of Watchmen, but I think the taxi driver who drove me home after I watched a screening of Brideshead Revisited summed up the Waugh conundrum best. 'They're making a film of that? Why bother? I remember when that was on telly - everyone watched it, the streets were empty when Brideshead was on. I've got the boxset at home, in fact. Jeremy Irons was great... and that Diana Quick -whoooar.' </p> <p>Goode is horribly aware of the opinion that the definitive Brideshead adaptation has already been filmed and of the hold Waugh's story has on the British generally - the 1945 novel and the 1981 TV series have become cultural shorthand for everything from the decline of the aristocracy to fashion trends. This year the new film's been linked to the revival of the Tories, the return of the cricket jumper and even Tony Blair's conversion to Catholicism. This has understandably put pressure on the production, which is directed by Julian Jarrold and stars Emma Thompson and Michael Gambon as Lord Brideshead and Lady Marchmain, with Ben Whishaw and Hayley Atwell as their children, Sebastian and Julia. </p> <p>'It is odd,' says Goode. 'I keep being asked in interviews what I'll be wearing this autumn. To be honest, jeans and a scruffy jumper like I always do. What would it prove if I said I was going to wear grey?'</p> <p>It's the morning before the press conference and Goode and I are aboard the Orient Express, reclining in armchairs in a first-class compartment of a Twenties British Pullman as a five-course breakfast is served. We're travelling from London up to Castle Howard (which, as in the TV series, is used as Brideshead). The train is remarkable but noisy; and my armchair's vintage suspension means I bounce like a washing machine on spin cycle when it picks up speed, which means I keep getting the giggles. The overall effect is farcical and would make for an odd day for anyone, but Goode has just landed from a 10-city, month-long tour of the US for Brideshead's release there, followed by an appearance at California's Comic-Con, the largest comic-book convention in the world, where he gave a Watchmen press conference in front of 7,000 people. He's exhausted and thoroughly fed up of interviews , and is upset by some of the press he's read. 'It's hard pretending you don't care all the time,' he says. To me he seems to care too much, he's woefully hard on himself and his talent. At times it's like interviewing Eeyore. Though he's very handsome in a nice, old-fashioned way (it's easy to see why his main TV roles were period - Marple, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries and Trollope's He Knew He Was Right) right now bleary is the kindest word to describe him.</p> <p>He admits he's particularly tired of questions about Irons. '\"Did you channel Jeremy Irons?\" Um, no. \"Did you copy Jeremy's performance?\" No.' He sighs. 'It's to be expected, but I thought I'd be thicker skinned.'</p> <p>Goode's had to discuss the film's plot ad nauseam during his interview tour of America, too. The script - by period drama supremo Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock, who adapted the Oscar-winning The Last King of Scotland in 2006 - emphasises the love triangle between Ryder, Sebastian Flyte and his sister Julia. The chronology is squished, characters have vanished and there's no voiceover, so the perspective of an older, wiser Ryder looking back at his life is lost - oh, and there's also a kiss for Charles and Sebastian. All of which will appal some fans of the book and intrigue others. 'It was hard without the voiceover,' says Goode. 'When you're got no words, it's difficult to be Mr Charm. I saw Charles Ryder as the loneliest person in the whole world. He had a loveless childhood growing up with no mother and a distant father - and who of us knows our father, anyway? Also, I'm no one, so just the fact that I was offered the part of Ryder is amazing.'</p> <p>Brideshead's producer, Robert Bernstein, says Goode won the role because of his wonderful stillness. 'The sign of a truly great actor is not what he says but what he appears to say when the camera is on him, and Matthew has that.' Goode seemed mesmerising on screen to me, but he is so sure of his performance's shortcomings that nothing I say convinces him otherwise.</p> <p>'Some people will have a problem with making the film into a love triangle,' he says. 'But I think that's just what happens when you adapt a book. I think the kiss [with Sebastian] is fine. I mean, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, really. Some will see it as a cop-out that we didn't show more... all I can say is that it's such a good story and we had so much fun making the film, it came from a really good place. We realise that people might absolutely hate it. But I'm with Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon and Ben Whishaw - at least if we go down in flames I'll be in good company... God, I've got really defensive over the last month, haven't I?' </p> <p>The answer is yes, but he seems so sad that instead I point out the window and say, 'Oh look, we're at Alexandra Palace.'</p> <p>'Ally Pally - good Lord,' says Goode, cheering up immediately once we've stopped talking about his work. We stare at the peaceful view over leafy north London as the Orient Express sets off slowly and Muswell Hill golf course rolls into view, already dotted with the pastels and brights of golfwear, though it's not yet 10am. </p> <p>'I'd rather be doing that today,' says Goode.</p> <p>Golf? I confess I've never played.</p> <p>'You should take it up. Golf courses are beautiful, it's good for the soul and it gets out the anger... well, if you don't care about the score then you won't have a heart attack.'</p> <p>Oh, but I would care, I'm very competitive. </p> <p>'Yeah, me too,' says Goode. 'I talk the talk, but I'm the most competitive shit in the whole world.' </p> <p>He played a lot of golf 'in the pissing down rain' in Vancouver when he was on the Watchmen set, which hits cinemas in 2009. Goode hadn't read Alan Moore's celebrated graphic novel before he auditioned for the part of Adrian Veidt, the cleverest man in the world, whose alter-ego is the costumed hero Ozymandias. </p> <p>'I felt lucky not knowing it because I'd have gotten nervous,' he says. 'I hadn't even read the script, when I auditioned. There was nowhere to do it other than my hotel-room bathroom - I was still shooting Brideshead in Yorkshire - so I read for it sat on the toilet with a white bed-sheet behind me. I thought there was no way I'd get it.' </p> <p>But he did. Tom Cruise and Jude Law were previously connected with the role, but Goode will bring it to the big screen. </p> <p>'Two days after I finished Brideshead, I was out in Vancouver. That was good: one minute you're in white tie and tails, then in a vest and shorts practising kung fu.'</p> <p>Veidt's acquired German ancestry for the Watchmen film - another deviation from a beloved text that Goode will have to talk about endlessly. 'I'm not American... I'm the wrong age... there'll be people who hate it,' he says. 'But I explained the German thing at Comic-Con - no better time than in front of the fan boys, after all - and they laughed, but they might have been thinking, \"This idiot's going to ruin it.\" What can you do?'</p> <p>He's perversely insistent that his career is all down to luck rather than talent when I suggest that he's done very well to land such big parts so quickly - his first film role was only in 2004. 'I've been very lucky.'</p> <p>It can't purely be luck. Your performances must be of a certain calibre, otherwise you wouldn't keep being cast.</p> <p>'Well, I don't want to think about it. I get so horrifically nervous every time I work, and I'm in a general state of fear the entire way - which just gets worse and worse as times goes by. That's where I am now.'</p> <p>He started acting as a child growing up in the Devon village of Clyst St Mary - his mother was director for the local amateur dramatic society - but gave up until his late teens because he went red on stage.</p> <p>You're a blusher? </p> <p>'I am,' he says, going red on cue and putting his hands up to hide his face. </p> <p>Though he's technically the youngest of five, there's an 11-year gap between him and his brother James and the other three, who are half-siblings (his mother married twice; she's a nurse, his father, who died five years ago, was a geologist). He attended Exeter School and he appeared in The Plough and the Stars and Richard III, aged 17. Brideshead co-star Michael Gambon was also a big influence on his decision to act. Goode saw him in a theatre revival of Volpone in 1995 which, combined with growing up watching TV reruns of Dennis Potter's The Singing Detective, made him think Gambon was God. He decided to study drama, at Birmingham University. </p> <p>'My parents didn't necessarily have the greatest relationship and that meant I wasn't great with girls at school. I didn't see them as friends; I'd try and kiss them, but as I thought swearing was the way to be attractive, that didn't really work. At university I got more comfortable in my own skin. Then at drama school in London I met people who were cool. I had flatmates who wouldn't let me go out in chinos and check shirts, which is no bad thing.' </p> <p>Now he's blissfully settled with girlfriend Sophie Dymoke - 'she works in the business side of fashion. I still don't really know what she does; she's given up explaining it' - who has moved back to the UK from New York, where she worked for cashmere brand Vince, so she can be with him. His brilliant smile when he talks about her means Sophie's definitely made the right decision. Though he says he's going to have to try to be more interesting now she's here. 'Sadly, she doesn't want to watch 38 episodes of The West Wing in a row.' </p> <p>His quest to fascinate won't involve celebrity parties or red carpets, though. 'I don't rage against the dying of the light. I like a few pints, but that's it. I've never understood why people go to award ceremonies and premieres unless it's for a good friend or because you're nominated yourself. I mean, people can do what they want, but I'd feel like a charlatan.' </p> <p>What he really wants is to work out what to do next. He's had a year off from acting a couple of times already. 'I'm so lucky, my agent Simon Beresford lent me money for my rent. He's an extraordinary man and I sit here solely because of him. After my father died, he's become like a father, though he doesn't give me quite as many dressing-downs.' </p> <p>Goode thinks he'd like to go back to theatre. </p> <p>'I want to learn again and the only place I'll do that is the theatre. I want to get more confidence - if I'd don't find it in the theatre I'm stuffed.'</p> <p>Hours later, back at the press conference in Castle Howard's Long Gallery, the room has finally quietened down after Goode's flirty penis story. The floor is opened for the next question and a suited journalist on the front row raises his hand. </p> <p>'Could I ask...' he starts.</p> <p>'No, I'm not getting my cock out for you,' says Goode, his charming smile widening to a grin. </p> <p>The room roars with laughter. There must be only one person here who lacks confidence in Goode's charisma and talent for performing, and that's Goode himself.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Brideshead Revisited is out on 3 October</p>",
  "<p>James Hewitt was 'Gentleman Jim' without a trace of irony. Lee Sharpe was, inevitably, 'Sharpe Shooter' and Iwan Thomas, the eventual winner, was 'The Dragon'. In bright outfits, amid high fives and histrionics, they fought out contests such as 'Murder Ball' and 'Armed and Dangerous'. This was Celebrity Wrestling in 2005, and its ratings of 2.6 million were among ITV1's worst on a Saturday night in its 50-year history. </p> <p>It seemed proof that celebrity-led reality formats had hit a brick wall. Moreover, given the rise of digital channels and the internet, Celebrity Wrestling smacked of desperation at the inexorable decline of that most nostalgic of family gatherings: Saturday night television. </p> <p>But on BBC1, something was stirring. The corporation had dropped its own clanger in 2004 with Johnny Vaughan and Denise Van Outen's Passport to Paradise, but redeemed itself with a surprise hit called Strictly Come Dancing. A year later it was breathing life into a seemingly moribund concept by reviving Doctor Who, starring Christopher Eccleston as the Time Lord and Billie Piper as his assistant. At the time it seemed like a risky \u00a310m gamble on a show that had petered out before. But thanks to Russell T Davies's reinvention and state-of-the-art computer graphics, the sci-fi drama trounced the opposition and brought families back to the Saturday night living room in their millions. Crucially, it appealed to both parents and children, male and female.</p> <p>Three years on, David Tennant has assumed control of the Tardis and Saturday night viewing has regenerated in dramatic style. It is not just a matter of ratings, though these continue to improve. Saturday night TV is less likely to be sneered at than to get people of all ages and classes debating the latest Doctor Who cliffhanger or X Factor reject. When Paul Potts sang 'Nessun Dorma' for Britain's Got Talent, it became a YouTube sensation and made a mockery of the idea of a typical ITV1 viewer.</p> <p>Popular dramas are playing their part, but it is the celebrity-led reality format that has come back from the dead. But now, wrestling is out, ballroom dancing is in. Last night, approaching 10 million viewers were expected to watch the first live show in the new series of Strictly Come Dancing, presented by Tess Daly and Bruce Forsyth, 37 years after he first hosted The Generation Game. It has been reinforced by a publicity blitz featuring one of the more unlikely contestants, BBC journalist John Sergeant, and throughout its run - the longest yet - can expect help from a steady trickle of tabloid stories about its behind-the-scenes soap opera. Last year's final was watched by 12 million people, still low compared with the Morecambe and Wise era when viewing choice was limited, but an increase of 30 per cent from the first series.</p> <p>At 7.30 last night Strictly Come Dancing gave way to Merlin, an ambitious magical fantasy starring Colin Morgan, Anthony Head and Richard Wilson, the BBC's thinly disguised attempt to fill the Doctor Who slot after the less successful Robin Hood. But ITV1 has recovered from its 2005 nadir. It took on Merlin with one of its big guns, The X Factor, masterminded by Simon Cowell, arguably the man who has done more than anyone to revive ratings and generate millions of pounds. Watched by more than nine million viewers, the acerbic Cowell was joined by Cheryl Cole, Dannii Minogue and Louis Walsh judging the singing talents of this year's hopefuls.</p> <p>Under siege from multi-channel TV and video on demand, BBC1 and ITV1 have reasserted themselves on Saturday nights, sometimes achieving an audience share of nearly 70 per cent. It is a return to the old certainties when two superpowers fought a war of attrition for ratings supremacy. This year, the climax of ITV1's Britain's Got Talent, another brainchild of Cowell, slugged it out for an audience of 20 million with the final of BBC1's I'd Do Anything, a live public audition for the role of Nancy in a new West End production of Oliver!. Minority channels could hardly get a look in, many computers and PlayStations had the night off, numerous dates were put on hold. Telly was back in business.</p> <p>'What Saturday night TV has pulled off is a hell of an achievement, making everything bigger, stronger and more compelling,' said Peter Bazalgette, the media consultant and former producer of Channel 4's Big Brother. 'To create family viewing that satisfies small children, teenagers, adults etcetera, the stakes are incredibly higher because there are so many distractions for all of them now.'</p> <p>The shows contain a heady cocktail of celebrity, popular music, elation or humiliation, and a sporting competition in which the viewers have a stake because they vote for the winners and losers. Bazalgette added: 'Strictly Come Dancing and The X Factor have taken the old talent show format, like Opportunity Knocks in the Sixties, and made it like Survivor and Big Brother with a narrowing so that people fall out. There is a strong story arc, and people vote so they have an emotional investment. The contestants are given an enormous amount of training so they will give good performances. They have added buckets of flavour on a Saturday night and it shows TV as a medium is not dead.'</p> <p>Saturdays are now the showcase for 'event television', a rearguard action against the predicted death of the schedule. In an era when you can record a programme at the touch of Sky+, or catch up with it later on the BBC's iPlayer, why bother to dash home for a particular show on a Saturday - or any other time? The answer is that you will if it's live, if you have the chance to vote, and if the results are likely to be plastered over the next morning's papers or talked about in the office on Monday. Like a live football match, these shows have their purchase in the here and now, especially important for ITV1 as a rare occasion when adverts have a captive audience. Each finale has become a national event.</p> <p>Elaine Bedell, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, has said: 'There's no question that there seems to be a rejuvenation in communal viewing. People are sitting down together on Saturday nights desperate to watch the shows, because however many catch-up services there are, they know people will be talking about it the next day and they want to be part of that.'</p> <p>The hits are also meticulously geared towards what ITV's Peter Fincham, when he was controller of BBC1, described as '3GTV', or three-generation television. These appeal to children, parents and grandparents alike. Jay Hunt, controller of BBC1, said weekend TV is making 'shows with cross-generational appeal'. She added: 'When we approach Saturday nights the ambition is to put together a schedule that will hold an audience for the whole evening.' </p> <p>Forsyth, 80, believes Strictly Come Dancing has perfected this art of triangulation. 'The X Factor caters for a certain type of viewer, but we cater for everyone,' he said recently. 'Children love Strictly Come Dancing - they see something on television they've never seen before. They see PlayStation but don't see actual human beings twirling round the floor. Then you go right up the whole age group to people of 80 and 90, like myself, who remember ballroom dancing from when we were teenagers.'</p> <p>ITV1 sought to hit back with Dancing on Ice, but truly discovered its '3GTV' audience with Britain's Got Talent, presented by Ant and Dec. Last year's winner, opera singer Paul Potts, brought tears to the eyes of judge Amanda Holden, and was succeeded by teenage breakdancer George Sampson, who started busking because his mother couldn't afford to pay for his dance classes.</p> <p>It is all and meat and drink to the press, which both feeds off and generates hype around the show. Britain's Got Talent is a platform for rags-to-riches stories and emotional high and low notes. Choirboy Andrew Johnston's rendition of 'Pie Jesu' was moving, while Asian dancing duo Signature's routine was simply hilarious. It was watched by 14 million people, a reawakening of shared experience viewing on a national scale. It has been speculated that the trend will grow as families stay at home because the economic downturn has forced them to reduce Saturday evening spending.</p> <p>Claudia Rosencrantz, who as controller of entertainment at ITV until 2005 commissioned X Factor and Britain's Got Talent, said: 'In the 10 years I was responsible for Saturday nights at ITV there was a constant debate over whether it was in terminal decline. Gladiators and Blind Date had done them proud for years but they were coming to the end of their lives. Saturday nights were in the doldrums.'</p> <p>But when Rosencrantz commissioned Popstars and the hugely successful Pop Idol, the tide began to turn. 'I wanted to prove Saturday night telly wasn't dead,' she added. 'The big challenge - which is incredibly difficult to pull off - is to have that broad appeal, from nine to 90. You have to take timeless themes and subjects that resonate deeply. People enjoy watching something inclusive on Saturday nights. I think there's an appetite for well-made glossy entertainment shows that are compelling. You can breathe new life into them.'</p> <p>The current crop of talent shows could one day face a loss of novelty value, as Big Brother has done, leaving a gap for yet another format to be rediscovered. Andrew O'Connor, a former actor who set up Objective Productions, said: 'If both channels are doing the same thing you wonder how long it can continue. Everyone wants to know what's next. The genre that hasn't been reinvented for a family audience is magic - we'd like to be the company that does that.' </p> <p>Despite their resurgence, Strictly Come Dancing and X Factor's viewing figures will not challenge the landmark shows of the past. Before the advent of cable and satellite, Morecambe and Wise regularly attracted more than 20 million. In 1979, when The Generation Game dominated Saturday night, BBC1 hit record viewing figures of 25 million. But by the time Jim Davidson was sacked as the show's host in 2002, it had sunk to 3.3 million.</p> <p>It seems that no show can dominate Saturday night for ever, however cleverly repackaged. For Brucie and Co there may be trouble ahead - but while there's moonlight and music and love and romance, let's face the music and dance.</p> <h2>Let's face the music and dance ... straight into the tabloids</h2> <p>It's not just the sequins, straight backs and six-packs of the female professional fox-trotters that make 'Strictly' - as it's known - an enduring Saturday-night hit. The drama, both on screen and off, draws millions of viewers every week and spawns forests of tabloid newsprint.</p> <p>Even before the first rumba of this latest series (number six) got under way, backstage rumblings were outing actress and celebrity contestant Cherie Lunghi as 'a trained dancer'. 'Foul', bleated the headlines. But, as sports presenter Gaby Logan knows to her cost, not everything is fair in the world of Strictly Come Dancing. Among the high and lows since the programme first aired in 2004, it was the voting off by the public of Logan, a talented former international gymnast on 4/1 odds of winning, that rocked the judges.</p> <p>The fact that GMTV presenter Kate Garraway, hobbling with tendonitis on 'two left feet', and Logan's rugby star husband Kenny, who performed with 'the grace of a vacuum cleaner', survived the public vote spoke volumes. No talent contest, this. Rather a brutal, bruising, popularity poll. </p> <p>But 'Strictly' really thrives on sexual chemistry and the whiff of scandal. Though conceived as a one-off, the headlines generated by the dancing partnership of erstwhile Kiwi builder Brendan Cole and former BBC newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky, left, guaranteed a second series. Cole was dumped by fianc\u00e9e and fellow contestant Camilla Dallerup amid intense speculation over the exact nature of his relationship with Kaplinsky. Her subsequent split with long-term boyfriend Mike Barnard, whom she met at Oxford, only fuelled gossip. Now married to investment banker Justin Bower and expecting her first child, she has always denied an affair with Cole.</p> <p>An equally smouldering combination between former EastEnders actor Matt di Angelo and professional partner Flavia Cacace produced not only risqu\u00e9 dance moves but also more publicity as Flavia ditched long-term partner and fellow contestant Vincent Simone.</p> <p>Romance definitely developed between Blue Peter's Gethin Jones and Welsh opera diva Katherine Jenkins after she performed 'Time to Say Goodbye' on the show. So, who will be next to waltz into the sunset?</p>",
  "<p>Some people look comfortable in golf carts, and others look like they would rather be travelling in a hearse. Lee Westwood falls squarely into the latter category. The Englishman is a Ryder Cup stalwart, not a Ryder Cup cheerleader, the kind of player who, as he succinctly put it yesterday morning, would tee it up in this event if 'my arm was hanging off'.</p> <p>All of which would explain his dismay at being left on the sidelines as Europe sought to play themselves back towards respectability after what can only be described as a miserable first day at Valhalla Golf Club.</p> <p>As the red, white and blue tide swept the home players along, Westwood was one of those who made them pause for thought, winning two half-points for Europe. Both matches looked lost for the visitors, and both times the Englishman produced the golf, and the requisite bottle, to snatch parity.</p> <p>That might have been enough to convince most people his presence was essential in both of yesterday sessions if Nick Faldo's side were to have the best chance of reducing, or even over-turning, their overnight deficit, but Europe's captain makes no secret of his pride in not being 'most people' and decreed Westwood's service would not be immediately required in the cause of the fight back.</p> <p>'Lee definitely didn't [want to sit out] but I wanted him to,' Faldo said in the morning, pointing out that Westwood was suffering with blisters by wearing new shoes. 'We still have 20 points to play for.'</p> <p>'I would have liked to play,' Westwood said. 'But it is a team game and you play as a team.'</p> <p>If Faldo emerges as the victorious captain that barely diplomatic exchange will be forgotten. If not, it will feature in any post-mortem, although in fairness to Europe's captain, he sent Westwood out in the first of the afternoon fourballs, partnering Soren Hansen against the big-hitting JB Holmes and the big-mouthed Boo Weekley.</p> <p>Weekley's southern charm has always been an acquired taste, but there will be even fewer takers after his crowd-baiting antics over the past few days. The golf world can be a bit po-faced when it comes to etiquette, but in the context of the Ryder Cup cheerleading from the players is acceptable. There are limits, though, and the boorish American has exceeded them this week by the length of a par five.</p> <p>Yet there is a reason why successive European captains have relied on the phlegmatic Englishman and it is that he uniquely equipped to handle the pressure of golf's most high-pressure event, being both a brilliant player and, most pertinently in these circumstances, a cussed character.</p> <p>This second quality was never more evident than on the 1st green yesterday when Weekley, having holed a longish putt for birdie, started his rabble-rousing antics. Westwood's response was typical of the man. First, he holed a long birdie putt of his own, then he tipped his cap extravagantly to the gallery before fixing Weekley with a stare that would have melted granite.</p> <p>No one was quite sure about the state of relations between the two men before this week, but they know with certainty now.</p> <p>Westwood is many things, but he is not po-faced. Yet even his state of pre-natural calm has been disturbed by what he and his partner have had to put up with. 'The Americans have taken a good hammering the last couple of times and they had to try something. If that means whipping the crowd into a frenzy then so be it,' he said, when asked about Weekley's conduct. 'I didn't expect the players to get involved, though, quite as much as they have done. We've never resorted to that, I don't think I would ever get that desperate. Golf is supposed to be a gentleman's game and that's what separates it from other sports.'</p> <p>The Englishman's contempt was not reserved for Weekley alone. Paul Azinger's remarks at what was billed as a 'pep rally' in downtown Louisville on Thursday night, to the effect that the home supporters should cheer when the visiting players miss putts, had not gone unnoticed in the European team room. Nor did his playground-esque, and entirely inaccurate, justification; they do it, so we can do it too.</p> <p>'There's always a respectful silence in Europe between the putt missing and the hole being won - he [Azinger] must be confused. It's unsportsmanlike if you ask me,' Westwood said. 'We're big enough and strong enough to handle that and ignore it. I've heard some nasty things out there from their supporters but you just shake them off. You just look at the person and imagine something disgusting coming out of their head and that does the trick.</p> <p>'I've heard them shout out \"in the water\" and other petty stuff. It was just from people who have had too much to drink and have lost control of their brains and their mouths. It wasn't like this at Brookline. Brookline was fine other than the last day.'</p> <p>The problem with pointing out such uncomfortable truths, especially when your team is being beaten, is that it often comes across as sour grapes. On this occasion, though, Westwood can be absolved of such charges. He simply tells it as it is and, as he heads out in today's singles, he will be hoping to put his case as forcefully, as decisively, as he can.</p>",
  "<p>The credit crunch may be starting to have an effect on racecourse hospitality as Tattenham Corner discovered with a cold call received last week from a company acting 'on behalf of Cheltenham racecourse'. </p> <p>Apparently, a 'late cancellation' had led to a hospitality facility on Gold Cup day at Cheltenham becoming available for a mere \u00a39,000 instead of the original \u00a315,000 asking price. Did Tattenham Corner know of anyone that might be interested in the knockdown deal?</p> <p><strong>Baker without any dough</strong></p> <p>One of the most remarkable stories last week was the tale of 28-year-old Michael Baker, who was jailed for three years for fraud. The Kent-based van driver persuaded trainer Henry Cecil (right) to buy him a horse for \u00a345,000 and, rather more amazingly, asked bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson to buy him four broodmares worth \u00a35.2m last year. Baker, whose mother Lesley is a permit-holder, approached several other trainers. One of those, Kim Bailey, is pleased he did not fall for Baker's advances. </p> <p>'Thankfully when he approached me to buy horses for him he mentioned an existing owner of mine as someone he knew very well. As a result I made enquiries and soon found out that Michael Baker was not capable of what he said, so I took the order no further.

  "<p>When the Declaration of Human Rights was made, Tom Stoppard was 11 years old and living in Nottingham. In his short life he already had good reason to be sharply aware of its ideals. Having escaped from Czechoslovakia in 1939 - many of his Jewish relatives did not get out - the day the Nazis invaded, his family had lived as refugees for three years in Singapore. When the Japanese invasion forced them to move on again his mother took her two boys - Tom and his elder brother, Peter - to India; their father remained behind as a volunteer in the British army and died in a Japanese prison camp. </p> <p>Sitting opposite Stoppard in his flat in Chelsea Harbour, looking upriver, all these years on, it is hard to imagine him as that fatherless five-year-old asylum-seeker, Thomas Straussler, in Darjeeling. Stoppard, with several lifetimes worth of brilliance behind him, is the epitome of English raffishness, warm-hearted and courteous, offering sandwiches and tea, dragging on a cigarette as he thinks. He struggles a bit with the idea of the memory of his boyish self, too. </p> <p>'From my perspective, looking back, it was life going on. I wouldn't have known the word \"refugee\" when I was one, however I would have known that we had been bombed out of Singapore, and bombed on the ship, and we had lost our father. But that kind of uncertain situation went back further than my memory went back at the time. It was just my childhood.'</p> <p>That Stoppard was 'saved' in some respects from that uncertainty by the arrival in his life of a very British stepfather, an army major, has indelibly shaped his view of his adoptive country. By the time he arrived in Nottingham, with his new English name, he was already a champion of Britain's finer virtues. 'I was only eight. But when I came here America was the glamorous country and England was, in my mind, the country to do with the creation and spread of civilisation. In India we had not been Raj people until my mother remarried but after that I think I was turned into a proper little snob about the English.'</p> <p>Can he recall the previous sense of insecurity? Of always escaping things? </p> <p>'If I was trying to analsye myself as though I was someone else at that age,' he says, 'I would see someone who had completely pulled down the shutters.'</p> <p>Stoppard's writing, you could claim, has been a process of casting light on that formative shuttered-up experience in surprising ways. His plays from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead onwards have been preoccupied among many other things with individuals who, comically and tragically, have extremely limited control of their fate. Some more recent work has dwelt directly on the immigrant experience, particularly that of writers cast adrift. The genesis of the nine-hour trilogy The Coast of Utopia , for example, came from his wanting to examine the philosophies of two radical emigr\u00e9s from 19th-century Russia. He traces the history of that play now to a fascination with two quotations.</p> <p>The first, from Alexander Herzen, Russia's 'first socialist', was about a notion of Englishness that Stoppard himself had good reason to cherish and which he fears is now waning. Having come to Britain from Russia in 1852, Herzen had suggested that 'the English don't give asylum out of respect for us the asylum seekers, they give it out of respect for themselves, because they invented the idea of personal liberty'. </p> <p>The second quotation was from a celebrated critic, Vissarion Belinsky, who had been allowed out of Moscow at about the same time. In Paris, where he lived for a while in the 1850s, there was no censorship, but Belinsky was determined to go home. His friends tried to dissuade him. If he went back he would undoubtedly be arrested for his words, whereas in Paris he could publish anything. 'Belinsky's response was what made me want to write the play,' Stoppard says. 'He said something like \"At home everything I write had to be written so carefully - and when I had a piece coming out in the magazine Contemporary, students would buy a copy and eight of them would share it and stay up all night reading between its lines and get a sense that someone was talking to them about things that mattered. Whereas here in Paris you can write anything and none of it really means a bugger and nobody takes any notice of it. At home you understand what it means to be a writer.\" I was,' Stoppard says, 'tremendously struck by this paradox that under repression he could be himself...'</p> <p>Understanding what it means to be a writer, that paradox of being sometimes best able to fulfil that role in the harshest circumstances, has been at the heart of much of Stoppard's intellectual engagement. He has been a great champion of free expression, not only in his efforts to publicise and argue against the censorship and oppression of writers in the former Czechoslovakia and Russia and elsewhere, but also in his work. No living playwright delivers all the possibilities of 'play' in the way Stoppard consistently does. He is the natural playwright in conversation too, always looking for the other man's point of view, turning everything on its head.</p> <p>When I had first discussed the idea of talking about human rights with him, in a phone call, he suggested he was better at chatting than being interviewed, 'so would four hours be long enough?' I imagined it might.</p> <p>It is, in the event, a typical improvised performance, only slightly shorter than advertised. He begins with attempts at definitions and then immediately offers caveats. 'The thing about talking about human rights is that when one bears in mind the sharp end of it one does not want to worry too much about semantics. It's like that Hemingway story about two boxers. The one says of the other: \"Jack is a very intelligent fighter; you are aware when you are fighting him that he is thinking all the time. But then I won the fight because all the time he was thinking I was hitting him.\" That's it: People are being hit while we are talking, while we are thinking.' He then continues to talk, to think.</p> <p>Partly because of his background Stoppard was always acutely aware that in taking on some of these issues, he is, first, a writer in a comfortable country. They could never mean as much to him as they did to those who faced them daily. He could always get on British Airways and fly home. If he has sometimes appeared to be laissez faire about British politics, conservative even, it is because his animus has been directed toward other places, to the situation of other writers. The year 1977 was a sharp point in his life and his thinking and it was all about people who lived where he had started out.</p> <p>His fuel for getting involved with Czech writers and actors, and with his friend Vaclav Havel in particular, came from a deeply felt conviction that none of the freedoms is possible without freedom of human expression; Stoppard's plays had always been working definitions of that fact, in Prague, suddenly, he could see the drama unfolding in reality. That drama began with the publication by Czech dissidents of Charter 77, which was prompted by the arrest of the rock band the Plastic People of the Universe, and involved a charge sheet delivered to the government documenting its failure to adhere to the human-rights covenants it had signed.</p> <p>Stoppard spent a lot of the Seventies standing outside embassies with placards and writing letters, but going to see Havel for the first time was a watershed. He had learned about Havel's work from Ken Tynan in the mid-Sixties. 'I don't remember it as something that was all about human rights as a foreground fact,' he recalls. 'He was a playwright, he was banned, he was under house arrest. I had, earlier in 1977, also been to Moscow with a guy from Amnesty to talk about Russian Jews seeking exit visas and held in lunatic asylums. And after that I wrote two plays, one was about the Russian dissident situation, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, with Andr\u00e9 Previn. And I wrote a play about the situation in Czechoslovakia, Dogg's Hamlet, Cahoot's Macbeth.'</p> <p>Stoppard, with his inbuilt Czech sense of the absurd, and his inspired understanding of Shakespeare, shared a sense of how theatre - being made fun of - might be the thing an authoritarian regime was most afraid of. Alongside these absurdist dramas, with brilliant pieces of reporting in the New York Review of Books and elsewhere, and the translation of Havel's plays, Stoppard became a standard bearer in the West for the Charter 77 movement that began to undermine the Communist regime in Prague, and across central Europe, and ultimately ended in the Velvet Revolution and the installation of Havel as President. </p> <p>He is at pains to point out, however, that in all of this real-life drama the abstract notion of human rights was secondary in a way. 'One didn't need a public phrase to tell one that certain kinds of behaviour towards Czech or Russian citizens was morally wrong. For me human rights simply endorse a view of life and a set of moral values that are perfectly clear to an eight-year-old child. A child knows what is fair and isn't fair, and justice derives from that knowledge.' Particularly, you might say, a child who had Stoppard's childhood.</p> <p>Stoppard is above all interested in following arguments, but he never rests at conclusions. Talk of human rights takes him towards more fundamental beliefs about the nature of what it means to be human. The logician in him wants to see human rights either as being necessarily God-given, absolutes, or alternatively simply man-made, civil rules. They cannot be both and he flits between these two possibilities. Despite everything he reads in Amnesty reports, or just 'in the fucking Guardian every morning', he clings to a sense of innate human goodness.</p> <p>'A friend,' he says, 'a writer, once suggested one of those phrases I had tried to formulate for myself all of my life. It is that our human survival depends on \"a contest of generosity\". You know yourself that this instinct is undoubtedly true on the microcosmic scale of the family. Obviously, you would give your life for your children, or give them the last biscuit on the plate. But to me the trick in life is to take that sense of generosity between kin, make it apply to the extended family and to your neighbour, your village and beyond.' Being Stoppard, he is alive to the fact that the language itself wants to make this point: 'kind' comes from 'kin'; kindness insists at root that you behave to others as you would to your family.</p> <p>We talk a little about the possibilities of kindness, about whether they can be applied as a universal philosophy. The Declaration of Human Rights grew out of the worst abuse of them in history, but, to take current events, should we believe human rights can be imposed by force?</p> <p>'Well,' he says, 'you read the accounts of people being tortured in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. It is quite a hard thing to say without appearing to reach for Gandhi's dhoti, but I am convinced that if we, the great western liberal axis, simply refused to torture under any circumstances - even when we knew it might produce some information that would save thousands of lives - and by doing so we declared ourselves to be certain kinds of people, I am absolutely convinced that we would be making real headway in the war against terror.'</p> <p>I wonder if he feels that the right of free expression should extend in all cases to the right to offend? Where would he have stood on the publication of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet, for example?</p> <p>He pauses. 'If I had been a national newspaper editor no doubt I would have been scared to publish them, too. The ideal response would have been for the cartoons to have been republished in every newspaper in the western world along with reasoned rejoinders to why they should not be published. But when push comes to shove, I couldn't possibly castigate someone for not putting his staff in danger, or his family for that matter.' </p> <p>But don't human rights have to go beyond cultural difference in every case?</p> <p>He agrees. 'But that question is a leftover from an arena that no longer exists. The common ground of reason, that words have an integrity and they don't kill, has been replaced by a more surreal arena. When you think of honour killings, or clitoridectomy, how do we begin to engage with that at all?'</p> <p>One of the ways, perhaps, is through theatre, the example of Prague is perhaps the greatest expression of this. But does he believe dictatorships are always bound to fall, without foreign intervention?</p> <p>'One's gut feeling is yes. Let's say, given its history and geography, Czechosolvakia's history would always have evolved in some way. As it turned out it was like a fairytale. We never contemplated charging in to free the poor Poles and Estonians from their absence of free expression, because however dimly we had a sense that worse would follow...'</p> <p>Stoppard has lived long enough to know that fairytale endings seldom last. In his recent dramatisation of the home-made cultural forces that caused Czech communism to crumble, Rock'n'Roll - in part a homage to the Plastic People of the Universe - he ended in 1990, when everything was still to play for. He had, he says, originally planned it to end up in 1997 with a scene that showed how the freedom that everybody had dreamed about, the western way of life, wasn't entirely good news. But then his romanticism took over. He says he is happy to be thought of as a romantic, as sentimental even. That admission reminds me of the poignant theme in Jumpers in which Dotty, the former nightclub singer, goes mad with the thought that with man having landed on the moon all the mystery has gone from the universe. It always felt to me that that was Stoppard talking directly. Was it?</p> <p>He smiles. 'I think I have got over it. But at the time it seemed an immense change. It was as though up to that point the moon and the stars existed as an adornment for us. So it was a pretty sharp reminder of our true status alone in the universe...'</p> <p>As we have been talking he has spoken a little about human rights, or the basis of what being human is, as something that goes beyond the material. Does he have that faith? He pauses again. 'There is a level at which one can only give voice to some form of unreasoned conviction - and mine in that regard is that unless there is, for want of a better term, a spiritual universe, I don't see what is so important about anything including human rights. What I really think is that everybody who believes in human rights is unspokenly, possibly unconsciously, accepting some form of immaterial reality. I don't see the value in endurance or survival if we are no more than the sum of our molecules.'</p> <p>If he takes the implications of that phrase of Hamlet's, 'What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties... and yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?' which side does he come down on?</p> <p>'I don't believe that we evolved moral psychology, it just doesn't seem plausible to me as a biological phenomenon. About 40 years ago I said I just didn't find it credible that some green slime grew up to write Shakespeare's sonnets. And I don't,' he suggests, taking the longest drag on his cigarette and stubbing it out, 'find that idea any more plausible today.' </p> <p>Tom Stoppard's version of Chekhov's Ivanov is reviewed on page 19</p> <h2>The life of Stoppard</h2> <p><strong>1937 </strong>Tom\u00e1s Straussler is born on 3 July in Zlin, Czechoslovakia.</p> <p><strong>1949 </strong>Having fled to Singapore in 1939 to escape the Nazis, Japanese invasion compels his family to move to India and then England.</p> <p><strong>1954</strong> Leaves school at 17 to work as a journalist in Bristol.

  "<p>There are rave reviews, and then there are Kenneth Branagh's last week. 'Branagh here touches the soul in a way I've not seen him do before,' opined Michael Billington in the Guardian. 'Performance of the year? Without a doubt,' was Quentin Letts's take in the Daily Mail. 'In preparing for the production Branagh seems to have relaxed his spirit around every corner of the role before deciding where to screw up the intensity,' wrote Paul Taylor in the Independent, adding: 'This is great acting, no question.'</p> <p>The perfect 10s for Branagh's performance in the title role of Ivanov, a Chekhov play adapted by Tom Stoppard, prompted BBC2's Newsnight to ask whether Britain was entering a new golden age of theatre. </p> <p>Ivanov is the first show in a year-long season that the Donmar Warehouse is bringing to the Wyndham's Theatre, featuring Dame Judi Dench, Sir Derek Jacobi and Jude Law, who will play Hamlet under Branagh's direction. Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are headlining at the National Theatre, Michael Gambon and David Walliams are about to open in Harold Pinter's No Man's Land, and the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hamlet, with David Tennant and Patrick Stewart, is such a hot ticket that when London booking opened the box office was taking 2,000 calls every second.</p> <p>With so much focus on Tennant, backed by his army of Dr Who fans, and other starry names, Branagh's first regular West End role for 19 years generated little initial excitement. Yesterday's man? They're not saying that now. His acting masterclass stunned critics, reminded theatre audiences what they had been missing and set the standard for every other A-list performer this season. And in the most elegant riposte to his doubters, the 47-year-old reaffirmed his talent by playing a debt-ridden fortysomething in the throes of a midlife crisis.</p> <p>It is tempting to declare Branagh the comeback kid, although admirers of his work on film and TV will know that he never really went away - in the autumn he stars in BBC1's adaptation of Henning Mankell's Wallander. More accurately, Ivanov could herald the moment that Britain's critical establishment learned to love Ken again.</p> <p>'I'm thrilled we've got a huge event on our hands now with him at the centre of it,' said Michael Grandage, the director of the production, speaking to The Observer from New York. 'What's happened is that Kenneth Branagh is back in a classical stage role, which doesn't come around very often, and he's doing it in the middle of the West End. All the planets are in alignment and I'm glad that it's being celebrated. This week proved that he's never been written off.'</p> <p>From the day that he published his autobiography at the age of 29, and was hailed as 'the new Olivier' after playing Henry V, Branagh has been a target of tall poppy syndrome - a high achiever who needed to be cut down to size. </p> <p>He gave the critics plenty of ammunition with films such as Peter's Friends and Frankenstein, easily dismissed as self-indulgent follies. Friends believe that by hyperactively acting, directing, writing, film making and running his own theatre company, all before his 30th birthday, he showed a can-do attitude that offends a nation still in love with understatement and the underdog.</p> <p>Actor Richard Briers, who has been directed regularly by Branagh over the past 20 years, said: 'It's difficult in England because you put your head above the parapet and get it shot off. He's a loner and he's done a lot on his own. He's a great achiever and often English people don't like that. But I think he's now turned a corner and they've realised that he's a very genuine person.'</p> <p>Briers, whose daughter Lucy is appearing with Branagh at the Wyndham's, added: 'Lucy says he goes into every dressing room half an hour before the start and asks if they're all right. Everyone admires him because he always has his feet on the ground and he's never starry or stupid. He has greatness in him; I've always felt that. '</p> <p>Branagh enjoyed the sort of career start that was bound to arouse envy or suspicion. Born in Belfast and raised in Reading, he was only six weeks out of Rada when he made his professional debut in Julian Mitchell's Another Country, winning an award for most promising newcomer of 1982. He joined the RSC and went on to form the Renaissance Theatre Company, earning nominations for best actor and best director for Henry V at the 1990 Oscars.</p> <p>He seemed unstoppable. He told the Times last week: 'Because of the relative impact of what I was doing, because of that ubiquity, I suppose people thought there must be some sort of plan. What there was was an extraordinary amount of energy. What might be consistent between then and now is being passionate and energised about the things one loves.'</p> <p>His private life also drew unwelcome attention. He and his wife, the actress Emma Thompson, were felt by some to be insufferably smug and 'occupied a place in the public gaze somewhere between Burton/Taylor and Becks/Posh,' it was noted recently. </p> <p>Their divorce in the mid-Nineties was cause for schadenfreude, and Branagh's next relationship, with actress Helena Bonham Carter, did not burnish his man-of-the-people credentials with the media (he has since married art director Lindsay Brunnock).</p> <p>Some pundits now openly repent their early hostility. Mark Kermode, film reviewer for Radio 5 Live and The Observer, said: 'There were an awful lot of critics who took against this almost presumptuous, precocious someone. I was one of them. I admit that I was wrong. I'm a huge Branagh fan.'</p> <p>Kermode began to appreciate Branagh just as others were turning against him. He added: 'Branagh's had a love-hate relationship with the press throughout his career. People tend to have extreme reactions. I think the reason is that he's not afraid to be bold, look foolish and fail spectacularly - that's the key to Branagh.'</p> <p>Indeed, Branagh's CV has defied linear categorisation. Hits have followed misses, misses have followed hits, in a zigzagging line that could induce vertigo. He failed to make it as a Hollywood leading man but won an Emmy for his brilliantly chilling portrayal of the Nazi Reinhard Heydrich in Conspiracy. He also earned plaudits as Professor Lockhart in the 2002 Harry Potter film The Chamber of Secrets and as Ernest Shackleton in a film of the explorer's life for Channel 4. His direction of films such as Love's Labour's Lost and Sleuth was less well received, but in the West End his Morecambe and Wise homage The Play What I Wrote was a commercial and critical success.</p> <p>While the press turns every new assignment into a triumphant comeback or disastrous loss of form, Branagh just keeps on working. Recently he was in Sweden filming BBC1's Wallander, a \u00a36m series of three 90-minute episodes based on the crime novels by Swedish author Henning Mankell, which have sold 25 million copies worldwide. Branagh plays the heavydrinking, world-weary but razor-sharp detective Kurt Wallander, while the role of his long-suffering sidekick, Detective Martinsson, is taken by Tom Hiddleston, a co-star in Ivanov. There are hopes that Wallander, of which Branagh is also an executive producer, could become a Swedish Morse</p> <p>Branagh will also be seen in The Boat That Rocked, a film comedy about pirate radio written and directed by Richard Curtis, who said: 'He was the first thing we shot in the film. He rang me the day before and said, \"It's the first day and you'll have a million things going on tomorrow so you can completely ignore me, completely lose your temper with me, completely tell me to do things that I'm not supposed to be doing.\" He's a director himself and he was right, it was a very complicated day. I thought it was deeply charming of him.'</p> <p>If there is a question mark over his career, it is whether Branagh the director can ever match the sublime body of work fashioned by Branagh the actor. His Hamlet at the Wyndham's, which he has been working on for a year with Law, might deliver an answer, after which there will doubtless be demands for more stage work from him.</p> <p>Hamlet is the play that defines him more than any other, and which he turned into an uncut, star-studded four-hour film that posterity might yet judge his masterpiece. A decade or so from now, it is surely his destiny to follow Olivier once more by turning his attention to Lear. The best of Branagh is quite possibly yet to come.</p> <h2>Highs and lows</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 1988: </strong> Plays Hamlet under Derek Jacobi for his own Renaissance Theatre Company in the first of many performances in the role.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 1989: </strong> Described as the new Laurence Olivier after taking lead role in film version of Henry V.

  "<h2>Marjorie Nshemere Ojule<br>32, Ugandan refugee, now a trustee of Women for Refugee Women in the UK</h2> <p><strong>'If my husband is out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me'</strong></p> <p>In Uganda I was active in opposition politics at a grassroots level: working in my village, helping women to know their rights and teaching them reading and writing. I was detained twice. The horror that I experienced in there, you wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even your enemy. I was tortured, I was raped, I was burnt with cigarettes, I was cut with razors, electric shocks: all the horrible things you can think of to get information from someone. Eventually I escaped and came to England. It was scary but I'd been in this torture for some time, and I just wanted to be able to breathe fresh air again. I left my husband when I escaped and that's the last time I saw him. I don't have a clue where he is. If he's out there, if he sees my photo, I would love him to contact me. I may be dreaming about him when he's already dead but life is full of surprises. </p> <p>The child I have now is out of rape and at first I didn't want to keep her, I wanted to put her up for adoption. When I arrived in 2002, they took me to the hospital: I was malnourished, I was dehydrated, I didn't have any blood and the Home Office told me I had to go home when the child was born. After six months they wanted to check my daughter was healthy and it was only after that they said 'Oh by the way we have a family for her'. I said I'm not ready to give someone my child if they first want to see if she's developing at the normal rate and so on. At this time I was going to counselling and it made me a strong person: my wounds had healed, I was looking and feeling myself and I realised this child was part of me. It's difficult bringing her up but if I didn't have her I would have gone insane waiting for a decision from the Home Office. </p> <p>It's easy to say 'Oh asylum seekers have taken all the houses and so on', but the truth is that asylum seekers really suffer in the current system. When my case was heard in court, the judge agreed that I was tortured and gave me leave to remain on human-rights grounds. But the Home Office appealed against that decision. That was in 2004 and, until January this year, I was living in limbo, waiting to hear the outcome. Finally they gave me indefinite leave to remain.</p> <p>I got tired of sitting at home so I started looking for charities and it was through Women for Refugee Women that I met Natasha [Walter, who runs the charity]. I've been public speaking ever since, telling my story and telling the stories of other women who can't speak English. It felt like therapy as well: when there's a place where you can explode with anger and say 'why would the government do this?' it feels good afterwards, like I could breathe properly. Everyone asks me 'Oh my God Marjorie, how did you manage to deal with all these things?' I'd say the work I do with you keeps me busy. I've been to the House of Commons I don't know how many times. The first time was so scary but when I stood up and spoke, I looked around and everyone was nodding and I thought: oh my God, I have power. You can make me sign [for asylum seekers' financial support] 1,001 times a day [asylum seekers have to sign regularly to comply with Home Office regulations. Breach of signing requirements can result in detention] but you can't take my brains out of my head. I thought 'Way to go, woman!' Natasha tells me I'm amazing and I say 'I'm amazing because of you'. That makes me cry because if it wasn't for people like that I could not have had that power. I am so grateful to them. </p> <p>I'm putting in an application for my 10-year-old daughter to come here because my mother, her guardian, passed away. Looking forward to meeting her - that hope keeps me going. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.refugeewomen.com\">refugeewomen.com</a></p> <h2>Hollman Morris<br>40, Colombian journalist, winner of the 2007 human rights watch defender prize</h2> <p><strong>'I had to find out how people were slaughtered and nothing happened'</strong></p> <p>My seven-year-old daughter asked me a while ago 'Daddy, why do you only interview sad people?' She had just seen one of my shows where I talked to victims of Colombia's conflict but I explained to her they are not just sad, they also have dreams, hope and dignity...</p> <p>The people I interview are the voice of the 'other' Colombia, a Colombia that you don't see in most media, a Colombia that some people wish didn't exist. I knew from when I set out to be a journalist that my job was to show their stories. </p> <p>I first saw that need when I was a teenager watching the TV news and when they reported about a massacre in Segovia where 70 people were killed in one day (11 November 1988) and I thought 'Shit, what is that about?' and then a few hours later we were watching a national beauty contest. That defined my role as a journalist because I decided I had to find out how it could be in this country that people were being slaughtered and nothing happened. </p> <p>That has always meant problems for me with all the armed actors in the Colombian conflict. Since 1997 there have always been death threats from one group or another. But the most critical year of my life was between 2000 and 2001. A colleague who had been kidnapped and raped (by paramilitaries) said her captors had told her: 'Hollman Morris is next.' Around the same time my wife Patty told me she was pregnant. We fled to Spain with the help of an Amnesty International programme for human rights defenders because I was able to show my work from a human rights perspective.</p> <p>After a year we came back to Colombia. My options for work in Spain were to do menial tasks, be a parking lot attendant. So it was a choice between shooting myself [out of frustration] in Spain or I get shot doing what I love in Colombia. </p> <p>Our job as journalists is to look after people's rights. In a way we are the guardians of human rights. We may not be the activists who put out urgent action notices every day. But our work as journalists is to write, publish and denounce when there is a violation of any fundamental right. </p> <p>My generation has never seen a day of peace in Colombia. What I want is through journalism to try to build a better country for my children to live in so that they can live in peace.</p> <h2>Zmitser Dashkevich<br>27, leader of Youth Front, Belarus</h2> <p><strong>'I received hundreds of letters of support every day from all over the world'</strong></p> <p>I was arrested in September 2006 and charged with 'organising and participating in the activity of an unregistered non-governmental organisation'. After six weeks in detention and on trial I was sentenced to one-and-a-half years in prison.</p> <p>At that time I was leader of Youth Front, which is a Christian organisation of young people in Belarus. It is an independent political and social force which is in stark opposition to President Alexander Lukashenko, the last dictator in Europe. Lukashenko has openly praised Stalin and wants to turn our country back into the evil empire, the Soviet Union. We believe his politics are leading to the spiritual and moral degeneration of Belarussian society.</p> <p>On six occasions we have tried to register our organisation but every time our application was refused. In early 2006 Lukashenko became very worried in the run-up to presidential elections. He understood that he was losing his power because the younger generation - despite all the ideology and repression - did not support him. Young people are mostly pro-European and pro-democratic in outlook. We were holding protests against falsification of the vote. So he introduced a new article into the law making it illegal to participate in the activities of an unregistered organisation. I was the first to be prosecuted. </p> <p>After sentencing I was sent to prison. We slept in barracks and ate porridge and rotten meat. Very soon I started receiving hundreds of letters of support every day. They came from ordinary Belarussians, from Christian organisations and from members of human-rights groups from all over the world. These activists also sent thousands of letters to the government. And they sent lots of origami cranes - a symbol of freedom. I received some in prison. The censors checked my post and they unfolded the cranes to see if anything was inside. So I just received these creased, flattened-out pieces of coloured paper. But it was a powerful statement. </p> <p>The government had painted us oppositionists as a sad, marginal group on the payroll of the CIA. But when the prison guards saw all my letters, they said: 'Wow, the people are really behind this guy.' They started to understand the gap between the propaganda and reality. Even the administrators admitted the letters were proof of something big. It altered their outlook. As a direct result of the huge campaign of public solidarity I was released one-and-a-half months early and returned to lead Youth Front. We are still struggling against Lukashenko's regime but now they are too afraid to imprison people under the registration law. </p> <h2>Odette Mupenzi<br>31, victim of Rwandan genocide </h2> <p><strong>'I was very ill... I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again'</strong></p> <p>I realised being a Tutsi was not considered good by some people when I was 11, because I had a teacher who picked on us, saying we had funny faces. Then in 1990 [the majority Hutus] killed many Tutsi intellectuals in a stadium near where I lived. After that, I knew we were in danger, but I didn't expect what was coming.</p> <p>In January 1994, my family stopped sleeping at home because we thought we would be taken away during the night. When the genocide began in April, we fled to a religious seminary. The next day, lots of people turned up with machetes, guns, spears and axes. </p> <p>Many of us hid in a classroom. They came to the door and my father opened it, because they threatened to burn the building down. When he did, I saw them cut him open. I was hiding under a mattress and they put a gun to my face and shot me. I could hear people praying, then there was silence - everyone was dead. The next thing I remember was waking up in hospital.</p> <p>I've been fighting for life ever since. In Rwanda, all they did was wash the wound. An NGO helped me get treatment in Switzerland, but they ran out of money. I went to Germany and the same thing happened.</p> <p>I first met the human-rights group Aegis Trust when it set up a genocide memorial in Kigali [in 2004]. I was very ill at the time - my bones were infected and I was living on morphine. </p> <p>In March 2006, I came to England. I've had metal bones put in my jaw, and skin taken from my side and put in my face. I don't think people at home would recognise me. I can eat with a spoon and fork and drink from a tap. I don't know how to explain how the trust has helped me - thank you isn't enough. When they met me, I wanted to commit suicide. Now, I feel alive again.</p> <p>To be honest, I don't want to go back to Rwanda. The war has stopped, but there are still troubles - survivors have been killed to stop them testifying against people. I just want to live in a country where I don't have to look over my shoulder all the time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.aegistrust.org\">aegistrust.org</a></p> <h2>Ignatius Mahendra Kusuma Wardhana<br>25, Indonesian student activist </h2> <p><strong>'They put me in a cell. There were a lot of blood prints over the walls'</strong></p> <p>I was imprisoned when I was 20 due to my involvement in the National Student League for Democracy. In January 2003, the President brought in a new policy to increase fuel and electricity prices, so mass demonstrations took place across Indonesia. We held a demonstration in Jakarta and it ended with a performance in which we burnt pictures of the President and Vice President. The police surrounded us and one of my friends was captured. I was not arrested at this point because the police didn't have a warrant. But my friend was blindfolded and they threatened him, saying they would shoot him and throw his body in the sea. He told me all this afterwards - at the time we didn't realise that he was captured. </p> <p>When we went to the police station to find him, they gave me the warrant and arrested me. They interrogated me for about seven hours and a lot of the questions were not about the demonstration but about my organisation, who I was dealing with and so on. They put me in a cell that they called 'the tiger cage' because there was no bathroom in there; it's like when you're in the zoo and you see animals in a cage. It's a place where the police beat up prisoners too so there were a lot of blood prints over the walls. </p> <p>In every trial the President's supporter came and threatened me and my lawyer. Maybe my lawyer was not brave enough because at the sixth or seventh trial he backed down and gave up. I was in despair because I thought I had no other way out. In April 2003 I was sentenced to three years. I was put in a cell they called the dry cell because there is no water at all - they gave us a drink once a day. There was a prisoner who sort of ran the prison, a member of the President's party, who fought me every week. Well, it wasn't really a fight because they were about 20 people and I am only one. The prison officer knew what was going on but I guess he was given money.</p> <p>Amnesty International is familiar with the Indonesian movement and it made a greeting-card campaign, sending cards to me and to the Indonesian President. I counted more than 4,000 letters. They made me feel better and gave me hope but, most important, they meant that the prison officer was more careful with me. I was there for two years, seven months and three days: I counted every day but the most significant factor in keeping my spirits up was the campaign. When I got letters from children in the UK I just couldn't believe that they were aware of me and were doing something about it. </p> <p>Indonesia is in a transitional period right now and there is still a lot to do for human rights. The first thing I did when I was released was demonstrate outside the prison because even though we got a new President with the 2004 election, he has continued repressive policies against activists. Prison is a bad memory but I got a lot of experience and lessons from it. I'm going to study human rights and politics at York University in October and after that I will continue my organisation. This is what I live for, this struggle.</p>",
  "<p>Eight members of the cabinet joining the dole queue. The number of Labour MPs reduced to a shattered rump of just 160. David Cameron strolling into power with a crushing landslide. That is the apocalyptic scenario facing Labour as the party gathers for its conference in Manchester. </p> <p>We knew before this weekend that Labour was in desperate trouble. What we know now, and in forensic detail, is that the party is stumbling towards a massacre.</p> <p>Conventional opinion polls measure the national share of the vote, but translating that into what it would mean at a general election relies on the use of crude swingometers and the uncertain assumption that the same swing would occur across the country in very different types of seats and contests.</p> <p>Using a huge sample of more than 34,000 people in 238 marginal constituencies, the poll for <a href=\"http://www.PoliticsHome.com\">PoliticsHome.com</a> is the largest representative survey of its kind ever conducted in Britain. It provides a definitive picture of public opinion in the key seats that will decide the next election. The findings could not be more devastating for the Labour MPs who will be spending this morning checking the data to see which of them are going to lose their seats.</p> <p>Cameron is projected to walk into Number 10 with a steamroller majority of 146. In the new House of Commons, the Conservatives would have 398 seats, the sort of dominance they used to enjoy when Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. There would only be a rump Labour party left to oppose him. The number of Labour MPs would be slashed by more than half to 160, a band smaller than after the 'suicide note' election of 1983 when Labour was led by Michael Foot. The Liberal Democrats would lose slightly less than a third of their representation in the Commons and end up with 44 seats. </p> <p>After the most humiliating rout, Labour is pushed back to its hardcore redoubts in South Yorkshire, the north-east, the Welsh valleys and deprived inner-city seats. All the gains of the Blair years are wiped out and worse. In southern England outside London, Labour is left clinging to one seat: Bristol South is a lonely island of red in an ocean of blue. It is as if New Labour had never happened. Just as during its bleakest years in the Eighties, Labour is driven out of Middle England. </p> <p>There would be a cull of the cabinet. Senior ministers, like other Labour MPs, have tried to console themselves with the thought that they might somehow defy the national swing against their party. This poll, by sampling opinion in their own seats, destroys that consolation. A third of the cabinet would be handed P45s by the electorate. Big-name casualties include the Justice Secretary Jack Straw in Blackburn and the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith in her West Midlands seat of Redditch. Gone too is the Chief Whip, Geoff Hoon. Blairite casualties of the slaughter are James Purnell, the Work and Pensions Secretary, and John Hutton, the Business Secretary. Defence Secretary Des Browne, Universities Secretary John Denham and Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly would all be looking for new jobs. </p> <p>The poll indicates that the Conservative surge is at its strongest in the Midlands, a region packed with election-deciding marginals. The Tories can expect a major revival in Wales. The view that the Conservatives are doing poorly in northern England is shown to be misleading. While the swing to the Tories is not so powerful in Yorkshire and Cumbria, the Conservatives are now performing strongly across the rest of the North, robbing Labour MPs of another consolation.</p> <p>Scotland is the exception: there the Tories are making almost no progress in key marginals. The big winners north of the border are Alex Salmond's Nationalists. They win all nine of the target seats polled and would gain a further eight if the swing were repeated in other Labour constituencies. That includes a predicted SNP win over Labour in Glenrothes, where a looming by-election is regarded as crucial to Gordon Brown's survival prospects. </p> <p>London is also swinging to the Tories, though less powerfully than other parts of the country. The capital also provides one small morsel of gladdening news for Labour. Support for Respect appears to have collapsed, and the poll suggests that Labour will regain Bethnal Green and Bow.</p> <p>There may be some cause for concern for the Conservatives that few voters can name their Tory candidate. Fewer than a tenth of respondents in Corby know that novelist Louise Bagshawe is the Tory standard bearer. Zac Goldsmith is better known in Richmond Park - the south-west London seat which he is projected to win from the Lib Dems - but even then less than half of voters can name him as the Tory candidate. </p> <p>For Nick Clegg and his party, the outlook is sweet and sour. This monster poll of marginals indicates that Lib Dems may buck the national trend when their MPs are defending seats from attack by the other parties. That's partly because Lib Dem MPs are so assiduous at digging in and nurturing a high personal vote. Lib Dem MPs tend to outperform MPs of other parties when voters are asked to rate their representative for being local, approachable, independent and in touch.</p> <p>This incumbency factor, combined with tactical voting, helps to save a number of Lib Dem seats. But that won't be enough to spare all of them from the scything swing to the Tories. Their most high-profile casualty is projected to be Chris Huhne, the past leadership contender and their home affairs spokesman, who is projected to lose his Eastleigh seat. </p> <p>The depressing finding for the Lib Dems is that there is little evidence of any success for their strategy of targeting Labour seats in the hope that this could offset losses to the Tories. Polling in these marginals finds that the drop in Labour support is benefiting the Conservatives far more than it is the Lib Dems. In some cases this even means the Tories can win from a third place at the last election.</p> <p>The poll tells us why Labour is so abjectly unpopular in the crucial marginals. Asked to name the issues that are most important to them, the voters in these seats put the economy first, closely followed by law and order. Crime and the economy are top of the agenda in every group of marginal seats and across all of the parties' swing voters. Then comes health, education, immigration, tax and inflation. Immigration is a big issue for voters in the most urban of the marginal seats such as those in London, Birmingham or West Yorkshire, but registers little in the south-west or Scotland. </p> <p>With the exception of education (where they are neck-and-neck), and health, which is still a 'Labour issue', all the issues that voters regard as most important are those on which the Tories lead Labour. Voters prefer Tory policies to the Labour alternative by a margin of almost two to one. What is true of the policies is magnified when it comes to how voters regard the rival personalities. David Cameron is preferred as best Prime Minister by more than twice as many people as those who choose Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Even among voters still prepared to support Labour, many do not have confidence in the Prime Minister. Only 61 per cent of Labour voters say Brown is the best person to be Prime Minister. By contrast, 86 per cent of Tory voters name Cameron. Just 28 per cent of Lib Dem voters, and only 8 per cent of voters as a whole, think that Nick Clegg would be the best Prime Minister, indicating that the Lib Dem leader has a lot of work to do to build his credibility. </p> <p>The other parties like to comfort themselves with the thought that support for Cameron is shallow and flaky; this poll suggests they are fooling themselves. Not only do the Tories have a massive lead in marginal seats, their vote is also the most robust. Half of their supporters say there is no chance at all of them changing their minds, and a further 36 per cent say it is unlikely they will switch.</p> <p>In comparison, more than a fifth (22 per cent) of Labour's remaining supporters say it is likely or possible that they will switch their support to another party. Dire as it is for Labour, things could get even worse.</p> <p>The poll does hold out the possibility for Labour recovery, but it is not a scenario that will appeal to Brown. He is a huge negative for Labour among marginal voters, especially those who might switch their vote. One of the most resonant messages among the potential switchers is 'Gordon Brown is the wrong man to lead the country'. Take that away and the Conservatives could lose support to Labour. Approaching half (44 per cent) of potential Tory/Labour switchers say they would be more likely to vote Labour if Gordon Brown were replaced as Prime Minister.</p> <p>That should concentrate some minds in Manchester, especially among the cabinet.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrew Rawnsley is editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http://www.PoliticsHome.com\">PoliticsHome.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Never go to Lidl on a Sunday afternoon. The staff are angry, and the shoppers are sad, and there's a greyish haze of gin-hangovers that hovers over the tins. In the car park of the Hackney branch last week, a man in a wheelchair was insulting strangers by the trolleys, and he had Lidl bags (9p each) on his feet. </p> <p>I usually go to Sainsbury's, mainly because I once saw Lily Allen there by the Actimel shelf, but this weekend the thought of a 'deep discount' shop was appealing, and besides, I like to follow trends - everyone's leaving the proper supermarkets for discounters, who are enjoying a boom trading period. Sales at Lidl are up 12.3 per cent. Also Theo Paphitis, chairman of Ryman and Dragons' Den judge, said recently that he would rather 'take razor-sharp pins and place them through my eyes' than shop at Lidl, and I feel it's important to oppose him wherever possible. </p> <p>Founded in Germany in the 1930s as Lidl &amp; Schwarz Grocery Wholesale, they dropped the 'Schwarz' (black) in the 1970s, because of the 'black-market' implications. The first UK Lidl supermarket opened in 1994. There are now more than 7,000 Lidl stores worldwide, with 470 in the UK, and in June it was named the third-biggest private firm in the EU, just ahead of fellow discount supermarket Aldi. Two months ago the Daily Star proved that Lidl was the cheapest supermarket for wine and ham, two, incidentally, of my favourite things. </p> <p>I invited Rose, my elderly neighbour, who we usually take to Sainsbury's, but when she heard that they didn't stock Heinz Sandwich Spread she said no. You can't really go with a shopping list, I explained, because you never know what you'll find. If walking into Sainsbury's is like walking into the middle of a massive children's party, which it is, especially at the weekend, then walking into Lidl is like being mugged by the guy who makes balloon animals. The ceilings are low, the shelves are high, and, apart from the gentle drone of the freezers, it is very very quiet indeed. There are no baskets. You are encouraged to walk around with a big cardboard box, which makes it difficult to pick things up. There is a lot of stopping, and putting down your box, and putting some sardines in it, and picking it up again. </p> <p>The Lidl journey starts with baked beans. They are to one's left and right, and after that there are chopped tomatoes, then lots of tinned fish options and then the vegetables. It was here, at the ready-to-eat beetroot, that I realised I was being followed. I'd given up on the cardboard box business and had started using my bag as a basket, which had sent the in-store undercover security guard into extreme panic mode. It was exciting. I pretended not to notice him, even when he stood extremely close to me by the pasta. I put a kilogram of spaghetti (89p) into my bag and continued to the potted-plants rack. Someone pushed past me to the checkout with a box full of tripe. </p> <p>In March, Lidl was accused of using Stasi methods to spy on its German staff and collect intimate details about their personal lives, including their bank accounts, relationships, and the frequency of their lavatory breaks. Observation period 9-14 July, 2007, at a branch near Hanover, reads: 'Saturday 10.10am Ms J tells Ms L that she has never paid her television licence fees because she is still registered with her parents, even though she lives with her boyfriend. The detective's end-of-week advice to management is that Ms J is a security risk.' One report from the Czech Republic revealed that staff members were banned from going to the toilet during their shifts. The only exception were women on their period, who, according to an internal memo were allowed 'to go to the toilet now and again, but to enjoy this privilege they should wear a visible headband'.</p> <p>The best bit of Lidl is their Enjoy The Great Outdoors clothing collection. As well as \u00a37.99 trainers, which you'd definitely get beaten up for wearing at school, there are piles of cagoules. My friend's dad, she says, dresses exclusively in 'middle-aisle Lidl and Yohji Yamamoto'. In the neighbouring aisle I found everything I'd need to commit the perfect murder, plus a dismantled bathroom shelf. </p> <p>My mood lifted slightly as I contemplated the cereals, in particular the Nougat Pillows. Walking up the confectionery aisle, there are brands you recognise (they had a deal on Yorkies and Toffee Crisps, all 79p a pack) alongside logos that look familiar but are, in fact, composites of lots of other brands. The Snickers typeface on a Juicy Fruit background, that sort of thing. They're like bad cover versions of the products you love - Dairy Milk as sung by Lidl Richard. Opposite the sweets, there's a huge bin containing one of their weekly specials - a wooden corner desk for putting a computer on. The photograph on the front of the box looks like it was taken in a halfway house.</p> <p>The meat is sold in deep freezers, which I couldn't get to for families scrambling for fowl. On a shelf nearby are the American-themed foods, but mainly Lidl sell their own brands - Strathvale meats, Solevita juice, Milbona yoghurts and Linessa cheese. Their new Fairtrade range, Fairglobe, includes instant coffee (\u00a31.75). It looks posh, much posher than the tin of squid in American sauce that I'd been appraising. I put it to the top of my bag. </p> <p>The alcohol aisle is thrilling. They sell small plastic pots of cocktail mix, lots of European beer, every flavour of Lambrini you can imagine and some prosecco for \u00a33.69, which I picked up. And then I queued, and while I queued I added more to my bag from the long shallow bins of gladioli and biscuits beside me. The man at the till was singing a religious song under his breath. It may have been a prayer. He pushed my shopping through like he hated it, and he probably did.</p> <p>It's been reported that all Lidl's checkout staff are told to put 35-40 items through the till a minute. Their average speed is recorded on the till's computer and is checked by managers each night. According to Uni Commerce, the international organisation of retail unions, one of the ways Lidl make savings is by copying Walmart's model of 'pressing down wages and benefits and squeezing as much as is possible from its personnel'. When the German retail union Ver.di invited workers to report on the company's bad practices it was contacted by over 3,500 employees. In 2004 they published a book called Das Schwarz-Buch Lidl Europa [The Black Book on Lidl in Europe], which chronicles how 'the company is obsessed with control... Everyone is treated with mistrust, as a potential thief'. In March this year, Lidl promised to remove secret cameras in stores. When their undercover work was exposed, the spied-on workers received what the head of Lidl Deutschland described as a 'thank-you payment' of \u20ac300.</p> <p>At the end of the conveyer belt, there's no space to pack up your spoils, so you're left squatting on the floor, frantically trying to contain your shopping before the next customer comes. The man on the till didn't wait for me to finish before the next shopper, who was buying a huge quantity of Choc Me cakes, was thrust through. He didn't make eye contact. Nobody did. When we left, the wheelchair man was still shouting at people by the trolleys, but the bags around his feet were now on his hands, like waterproof mittens. </p> <p>At home, I looked at my receipt. It was about \u00a310 cheaper than my usual Sainsbury's shop (\u00a350 for two), but the feeling of melancholy I was left with (the weak little tins of cheap meat, the broken boxes, the angry assistants, the air of hate) wasn't worth the saving. I had a dream that night that I was trapped in one of their industrial freezers. I won't be returning.</p>",
  "<p>It takes about 30 seconds to learn how to make cheese. Ready then? Heat your milk to scalding, squeeze in lemon juice and stir until it curdles. Pour the whole lot into a suspended sieve lined with a tea towel and let it drain. Stick a plate on the top, a plate with some kind of weight on it to accelerate the removal of the liquid, or whey, and two to three hours later you've got a nice fresh cheese - something like ricotta. Got that? Right, next you're going to need some easy-peasy-cheesey biscuits - well, hang on a minute, one thing at a time. I'd be quite surprised if you didn't know roughly how to make a biscuit, anyway, but aside from professional cheesemakers, I'd be very surprised indeed if anyone reading this has a favourite recipe for, or ever makes their own cheese. Don't write in, I'm just saying it's not common.</p> <p>Some things are better made at home. It would be hard to make a Christmas cake, a stock, a chocolate mousse, mayonnaise, chutney, or fruit juice that isn't far nicer than anything you can buy in the shops. You've only got to be shown how to do it once (possibly twice with mayonnaise) and you're in business. After that, the only reason to go with the ready-made version is convenience. They're never as nice.</p> <p>Cheese is different. Although the instant ricotta would be lovely spread on toast - especially with a bit of pepper and maybe a few chives, and would, no doubt, impress your guests as a starter - it would probably only be an all-right cheese. There is nothing wrong with all-right cheese, but then who wants the all-right stuff when there is excellent stuff to be had?</p> <p>It's a bit like making music. I could show you how to write a song. Even from scratch, assuming no musical background, we could knock together a three-chord wonder with two verses, a chorus and a breakdown section, inside an hour. It would have a certain amount of charm, although like the home-made cheese, it would most likely really only be all right. </p> <p>Cheese has only four ingredients: milk, rennet, bacteria and salt. That's it. The entire mild-cheddar-to-Stinking-Bishop cheese spectrum is composed of subtle variations of those four ingredients and temperature, humidity and time.</p> <p>In order to make a real humdinger, you need a good recipe. These are closely guarded secrets, intellectual property that can change hands for vast sums. But even the right recipe takes a lot of care and expertise to execute properly. The ins and outs of hard cheese, for instance, are quite different from the equations of blue cheese. Asking someone who makes stilton to work on a cheddar is a bit like asking a violinist to play a tune on a trumpet. They'll know where to start, but it's a completely different set of skills.</p> <p>In recent years, vast amounts of innovation have poured into British cheese. It's partly due to dairy farmers turning to it to add value to milk they were selling at a loss and partly because we've discovered an appetite for it. Cheese is the tastiest thing in the universe and sits at the spearhead of the revolution that has made our chefs more famous than our rock stars.</p> <p>The first week of October is British Cheese Week. All hail the genius of Lord of the Hundred, of Westcombe Cheddar, Berkswell, Ardrahan and 906 others. Blessed, indeed, are the cheesemakers!</p>",
  "<p>Suze Rotolo is the girl with the wistful eyes and hint of a smile whose head is resting on the suede-jacketed shoulder of a nice-looking young man as they trudge through the snow on the cover of 1963's The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The couple met in 1961, when she was 17 and he was 20. The story of their love affair is a microcosm of the early Sixties, when the gentle strains of folk music gave way to the electronic blare of rock and a few puffs of pot turned into a bad trip on LSD. For Rotolo, it was a trajectory that would take her from the sweetness of first love to the trauma of abortion.</p> <p>Dylan maniacs will scour these pages for clues to his lyrics - and find plenty. But they'll miss the point of this oddly organised (though not as random as it seems), delicately written, heart-tugging memoir of New York's Greenwich Village when it nearly was a village, and seemed the most exciting place on earth in which to be young. Rotolo's volume includes a map showing how closely packed into a few streets of the West Village the epicentre of the Sixties music scene was. One only needed to walk up Bleeker Street to get from Gerde's Folk City - where in September 1961 Robert Shelton discovered Bob Dylan and wrote the career-launching review in the New York Times - to the White Horse, where Dylan Thomas drank himself to death less than seven years earlier, and we all hung out at its tables trying to catch the vibes (though it was a few months earlier, and in Chicago not New York, that the kid from the Midwest, his bid to perform rejected, slept on my floor for a few nights during a folk festival).</p> <p>Rotolo, now an artist, captures this bohemian atmosphere with loving detail. Those who knew the scene will not be surprised to learn that it was she who taught small-town Bobby Allen Zimmerman about politics. She was the child of communists, whose affiliation had to be kept secret all through the Fifties and Sixties because of the overt persecution the family would have suffered during the McCarthy period. </p> <p>Rotolo seems refreshingly free of the paranoia that afflicted many of our generation and virtually all her parents' cohorts, which manifested itself in the habit of hiding copies of the Communist Manifesto and Little Lenin Library books from the eyes of neighbours in the Westchester suburbs. Dylan knew left-wing politics from the dust-bowl perspective of Woody Guthrie, whom he finally met as Guthrie lay dying in a New Jersey hospital in 1961. But it was from Rotolo that he learnt about the labour movement and the organised left, as well as about the civil rights and peace movements. In a way, Dylan's Jewish background equipped him better for life in Greenwich Village than did Rotolo's Italian heritage. Both her parents were Italian-born, but the culture (and personnel) of the left was strongly Jewish. There was a slightly frosty meeting of Rotolo and the Zimmerman parents for dinner after Dylan's under-attended Town Hall concert in April 1963, and another in October for his Carnegie Hall appearance. </p> <p>Following a temporary separation when Rotolo went to Perugia in 1962 to study, they were together until she decided to move out of the small flat they shared. Then, slowly, the romance fizzled out. Rotolo is generous about the break-up. Did Dylan leave her for Joan Baez? She says only that Dylan and Baez's 'professional appearances together were exciting and provoked gossip about an affair. At first it was just gossip - then, of course, it wasn't.' And she hasn't quite kissed and told. As she says: 'As Bob Dylan's fame grew so far out of bounds, I felt I had secrets to keep.' She still has a few.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. The publisher of Suze Rotolo's A Freewheelin' Time is Aurum Press, not Broadway Books as we said in the article above. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Beyond the small village of Gisagara in the Ndora district of southern Rwanda, the road dwindles to a dirt track. From here, it is just a few miles to the promontory at Mount Kabuye, along a route overhung by avocado and mango trees. It was this journey that Sylvestre Ntakirutinka, a retired agricultural officer, made with his 11-year-old son Emanuel in late April 1994, hoping it would save their lives.</p> <p>Two weeks after the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, with massacres of the Tutsi minority ethnic group taking place by the majority Hutus throughout the country, they and thousands of other Tutsis crammed into cars and buses to make the ascent to Kabuye, where they had been promised food and armed protection by local authorities.</p> <p>But by the time they arrived, smoke was already drifting from the surrounding hills, where Tutsi homes had been ransacked and torched. And as they watched police and the Interahamwe paramilitary death squads assemble on the surrounding hills with guns and machetes, it became clear they had been gathered not to ensure their safety but to hasten their killing.</p> <p>The shooting began that afternoon and continued, in sporadic bursts, for several days. When it finally subsided, the Interahamwe were sent in to finish the work. Emanuel survived, running from the hill as the killing began and eluding the militia stationed on the road to cut down Tutsis. But Sylvestre did not. Because of his professional connections, he was singled out by the authorities for a quick death and executed in front of his young son. When the massacre was complete his body was one of about 25,000 to be shovelled by bulldozers into mass graves.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, several miles from where a simple memorial marks the spot of the slaughter at Kabuye, Emanuel's brother, Sylvere Mudendeli, shows little sign of emotion when recounting the story of his father's death. Sipping a cup of ginger tea, he marks out the chronology of events with his finger on the tablecloth in front of him. His account is calm and precise. Of his immediate family of 14, only he and two of his brothers survived the events of 1994. 'You don't reflect too much for fear of it splitting your head,' he said. </p> <p>In 2003, Dominique Ntawukuriryayo, the former deputy governor of the Gisagara region, who is suspected of organising the massacre at Kabuye, was tracked to the French town of Carcassonne. There he had founded a children's welfare group which listed among its objectives 'helping children deprived of education by war, misery, extreme poverty, illness or the death of their parents'.</p> <p>Since then, Sylvere has worked tirelessly with a small French organisation, Collective of Plaintiffs for Rwanda, to piece together what took place at Mount Kabuye and build a case against the suspected perpetrators. He admits that for much of this time, it seemed a hopeless task. 'If you had seen what had happened during the genocide you would not imagine that justice could exist.' But on 20 February this year, a French court decided there was enough evidence to extradite Ntawukuriryayo to face charges of genocide, complicity in genocide and direct and public incitement to commit genocide. He was transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, on 5 June.</p> <p>Ntawukuriryayo has denied ever having been to Mount Kabuye and claims he was almost killed during the genocide for helping to save the lives of many Tutsis in his district. 'I contest in their entirety all the things I am accused of,' he said at his extradition hearing. 'My conscience is clear.' The trial is unlikely to begin for years.</p> <p>But Sylvere knows he is one of the lucky ones. Fourteen years after Rwanda's Hutus attempted to wipe out the Tutsis, leaving about 800,000 Tutsis and moderate members of their own kind dead, the chances of prosecution for genocide suspects living outside Rwanda remain minimal. </p> <p>'There are thousands of genocidaires living in EU countries, with large numbers in almost every European country including the UK,' said Rakiya Omaar, whose organisation, African Rights, has worked since the genocide to track them down. 'It's very difficult to put a figure on it since many of them have gone there under false names and identities. But the magnitude of the problem is overwhelming. A lot of these people are living in the suburbs, tending their gardens and going to church regularly. [Others] hold important positions. They have the confidence of being European citizens and feel no one will get at them.'</p> <p>Some are the foot soldiers of the Rwandan genocide, those directly involved in the killing who manned the roadblocks and hacked down their Tutsi neighbours with machetes and other farming tools. But many are high-priority suspects, those designated Category 1 by the Rwandan government: the businessmen, educators and politicians whose status and wealth qualified them to plan the slaughter and enabled them to escape its aftermath. New cases are being discovered frequently. Most of the suspects are in Belgium and France, absorbed quickly into the Rwandan communities there. In 2006, four suspected genocidaires, two of whom featured on the Rwandan prosecutor general's most-wanted list, were found living in Britain.</p> <p>One of them was Charles Munyaneza, the former mayor of the commune of Kinyamakara, who had gained refugee status in Britain having shortened his name to Muneza. He is accused of co-ordinating the slaughter with particular zeal, travelling throughout his area dressed in military uniform to urge on the death squads. More than a decade later, he was discovered living with his wife and four children in the nondescript Bedford suburb of Putnoe, donning tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt every day to go to work as a cleaner.</p> <p>All four suspects are awaiting a decision on their appeal against extradition to Rwanda. But Omaar thinks there are many more living in Britain. 'We believe this is only the tip of the iceberg and that the number of actual suspects is much higher,' she said. 'The UK, and other English-speaking countries in the West, are increasingly targeted by Rwandan genocide suspects for settlement. There are so many seeking asylum in Belgium and in France, so they think they should try new pastures. And they feel they should take advantage of being abroad to learn English and put their children into the English schools.'</p> <p>It was not supposed to be like this. After the genocide, there was an unprecedented outpouring of remorse from the international community about its failure to intervene in Rwanda. But in the years that followed, there was little evidence of a collective determination to track down and bring the perpetrators to account.</p> <p>Since it was set up in November 1994, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda has completed 33 cases with 28 convictions. Some European countries, notably Belgium and Switzerland, have tried suspects on their own soil with a handful of convictions resulting. But the numbers of arrests, prosecutions and extraditions are trivial in comparison to the huge number of genocide suspects living freely in Europe.</p> <p>Since 1994, the most determined genocidaire hunters have been a handful of survivors, human-rights activists and small NGOs (charities and campaigns) with a strong personal investment in bringing them to justice.</p> <p>Omaar can still remember the moment she committed herself to this work. A London-based Somalian, she travelled to Rwanda in late April 1994 at the height of the genocide. 'The first massacre site I went to was the parish of Rukare in Kibungo. I was walking through this parish and I could see people's history strewn there, photo albums, driving licences, identity cards, letters, toothbrushes.</p> <p>'The pews in the churches were ripped as people were desperate to find something to fight with. The ceilings were torn where they [the killers] had been looking for people. And even in the room for premature babies - the incubators were riddled with bullets because people had been shooting at them. Everywhere around you could see the struggle for survival and the determination to eliminate a people.</p> <p>'The only thing I could do was promise that I would do everything I could to ensure the world knew what had happened to these people and that they were not forgotten. Many times I have found the burden of working on Rwanda to be too high a price to pay but I always go back to that promise.'</p> <p>Now based in offices off a dusty track in the Rwandan capital Kigali, African Rights has produced dozens of reports, some naming hundreds of perpetrators, which have often resulted in criminal tribunal indictments and arrests in Europe. The process of investigating the Rwandan massacres so many years later is, she admits, slow and arduous. Omaar and her colleagues return again and again to survivors to ask them to recount their stories, monitor the names coming from testimonies in domestic genocide trials and wait for patterns to emerge.</p> <p>'At the beginning you are just trying to see what keeps getting repeated as a signal that's a path we should pursue,' she said. 'When you have five or six or seven people saying, \"This person distributed guns to us and said these are to be used for such and such a massacre\", you pick up these threads and you follow them through.'</p> <p>Their methods for locating suspects are much the same. They keep their ears to the ground and wait for information to come in. In many cases, the tip-offs have come from Rwandan Tutsis who survived the genocide and moved to Europe years later, only to find themselves living alongside their former tormentors.</p> <p>These encounters have often been in the most mundane of circumstances: a chance meeting in the supermarket, a familiar face in the street. Leaning over his desk in the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture, Janvier Gasasira still sounds incredulous when he describes how he got on the Brussels Metro one day in 2001 and came face to face with \u00c9tienne Nzabonimana, a Rwandan businessman who helped organise attacks in which Gasasira's entire family were murdered. 'I went up to him and I said, \"Hi!\"' he said. 'I was so confused, I had never expected to meet him again but I said to myself, \"I'll say hello to him in Kinyarwanda [the most widely spoken Rwandan language] and make sure if it's really him or not.\"'</p> <p>Nzabonimana's reaction was telling. 'He was very shaken up. He made out he didn't understand anything as if he was someone of another nationality. Then immediately afterwards, he got off.'</p> <p>Gasasira went straight to the Belgian police. Four years later, he testified against Nzabonimana in court in Brussels and saw him jailed for 12 years.</p> <p>'Testifying was a release for me and a duty for my family,' said Gasasira. 'If I had not done that I would have been a coward. I didn't do anything to merit staying alive [during the genocide] but I am alive and that may be a message that I can do something [to help].'</p> <p>His case is by no means exceptional. The Rwandan expat community is tightknit and survivors are often fully aware of where the genocidaires live. But in one crucial regard, he was fortunate; he found a justice system willing to prosecute Nzabonimana. Many other genocide survivors have found host countries less receptive.</p> <p>The pursuit of Dominique Ntawukuriryayo was beset with political hurdles. When the Collective of Plaintiffs for Rwanda first provided the French authorities with details of where he was living in Carcassonne, they were told there was no one of that name there. He would later be arrested at precisely that address. The collective has now lost so much faith in the French authorities that it routinely takes out civil cases against suspects it is pursuing, to ensure they will still be brought to court even if the extradition process fails. Britain has also been criticised for its slowness to act upon information about suspects on its soil. As the international community has dragged its feet over the issue, the fugitives have taken note.</p> <p>'The numbers are growing and growing,' said Omaar. 'Many of them are using citizenship and resident permits and the money they are earning in Europe to evacuate their own relatives who are also wanted for genocide in Rwanda. The failure [of authorities] to take action has been an encouragement. If timely action had been taken in these last few years to arrest, prosecute and extradite, it would have been a very strong symbol.'</p> <p>Fugitive genocidaires are also blamed for the creeping return to Rwanda of the ideology that underpinned the genocide. In April, the main Rwandan survivors' group, Ibuka, complained to the BBC and Voice of America that some of its programmes, broadcast in Kinyarwanda, had hosted suspected perpetrators who used their platform to deny the genocide.</p> <p>'It is incitement,' said Benoit Kaboyi, executive secretary of Ibuka. 'Those people from the outside are denying the genocide. They say we have exaggerated it.' </p> <p>Yet the biggest threat to Rwanda's future stability is not posed by historical revisionism. It is the signal that the continuing evasion of justice by fugitive genocidaires sends out.</p> <p>'We have a long history of impunity here - to the extent of being institutionalised,' said Rwandan prosecutor-general Martin Ngoga. 'We have got to a point where the country legislates in a way that promotes impunity and that's very dangerous. There should be a clear message sent out that you can't commit these kinds of crimes and go unpunished.'</p> <p>For the moment, that message remains obscured by a complex web of international diplomacy, legal procedures and difficulties caused by the sheer scale of the problem. But there are signs the situation is improving.</p> <p>The catalyst for this, in part, has been the decision to wind up the slow-moving and costly International Criminal Tribunal in Tanzania by the end of 2011. Host countries are beginning to realise that when that happens, they will either have to extradite suspects to Rwanda or deal with them themselves. Norway and Sweden have set up specialist war crimes units to address the problem of fugitive genocide suspects. The Netherlands, the UK, Finland, Belgium, New Zealand and the US are among the countries that have sent investigators to Rwanda to examine cases. More resources and investigators are now being made available, though these measures are still dwarfed by the scale of the problem. For Omaar, these developments are cause for cautious optimism. 'I wouldn't say there is massive political will, but there is more political will and interest than there was five or six years ago,' she said.</p> <p>But many survivors are sceptical as to whether the pattern of the past 14 years will change. One, who wishes only to be known as Marcel, 36, lost his entire family in a massacre at the parish of Mugina. Though he survived, the scars on his back and stomach where he was repeatedly slashed with a machete, and wounds to his head which cause him headaches and occasional epileptic seizures, are an enduring testament to his experiences. The man accused of directing the killing, Pierre-Claver Karangwa, lives freely in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Marcel has heard enough of the arrests and extradition proceedings taking place to dare hope that one day Karangwa will be brought to justice. But his optimism is tempered by the grim lessons he draws from the genocide.</p> <p>'I would say that the international community doesn't exist,' he said with undisguised bitterness. 'At the time of the genocide, we spoke about it but those countries did nothing and people were abandoned. Up until this moment I thought the international community didn't exist. And now, with the fact that these genocidaires are at liberty, I still see signs that it doesn't.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Redress helps torture survivors seek justice. For information, see <a href=\"http://www.redress.org\">redress.org</a></p> <h2>Sole survivor: Marcel's story</h2> <p>I was in my last year at secondary school when the genocide began. It was the holidays and all the family was together - I had four brothers, three sisters and my mother. Around 12 April [1994] rumours began to circulate that Tutsis in the area were going to be hunted down so we took our valuables and fled, moving at night and hiding in different places. We arrived about a week later at the parish of Mugina, where the local mayor Callixte Ndagijimana was protecting Tutsis, and found thousands of people there. </p> <p>A day or so later, after the murder of Ndagijimana, the Interahamwe [Hutu paramilitaries] surrounded the hill and began to attack us. We fought back with rocks for three days but they then launched a massive attack with guns and grenades, forcing us back into two churches, a large one and a small one. My family had split up and my sisters and mother were in the small church. The interahamwe surrounded it and started to throw grenades inside. We could hear the noise of children and mothers crying. </p> <p>The next day they broke down the door of our church and forced us out. We were made to take off our clothes and someone stood behind each of us with a machete. One of my family's neighbours - someone I knew very well - blew a whistle as if to start a football match and they began to hit us with their machetes. I lost consciousness and when I came to later, I saw everyone on the ground around me. There were children crying nearby because they weren't yet dead. </p> <p>In the following days, the interahamwe came back to go through our clothes looking for money. I had to pretend I was dead for two days. As they were rifling through our clothes they heard shots from the advancing [Tutsi] RPF army and fled. Later the Red Cross arrived and I was taken to the hospital. I was the only member of my family who survived the genocide. </p> <h2>Rwanda's genocide: How events unfolded</h2> <p><strong>The background </strong></p> <p><strong>1923</strong> Belgium accepts a mandate to govern Ruanda-Urundi.

  "<p>Government plans that would force tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain, unbranded packets could be the most powerful tool yet unleashed in the war on smoking.</p> <p>The tobacco industry has admitted that the tactic, being pioneered in Britain but likely to be followed elsewhere, will slash profits and inflict enormous damage on cigarette manufacturers.</p> <p>Tobacco analysts have warned in a leading industry magazine that a ban on branding and logos on packets would lead smokers to abandon well-known brands such as Marlboro and Silk Cut, which cost up to \u00a36 a pack, and switch to cheaper options. Public health officials say it will strip cigarettes of their glamorous image and reduce the numbers of young people taking up the habit.</p> <p>The Department of Health is considering outlawing the use of logos, colours and graphics on packets and requiring them to be sold in plain packaging. The latest issue of Tobacco Journal International reports that 'according to analysts from Morgan Stanley, if generic packaging becomes a legal requirement in the UK, not only could it have a domino effect on other markets, but it could also have a materially adverse impact on cigarette brand equity [and] could result in considerably reduced profits'. David Adelman of Morgan Stanley said: 'If plain packaging were adopted in the UK, some other nations would most likely mandate [it] as well.'</p> <p>Adam Spielman, a tobacco analyst at Citigroup, told the publication: 'Plain packaging would level the playing field, making premium brands less attractive to smokers, and would lead to a rapid worsening of the downtrading [falling sales] trend which has been going on for years in the UK, far and away the most expensive country in Europe for smokers.' </p> <p>Tobacco companies fear that introducing the plain packaging would prompt many smokers to abandon the premium brands such as Marlboro and Benson and Hedges, and instead switch to much cheaper makes costing \u00a33.50 to \u00a34. </p> <p>As for the global tobacco industry, the seminal legislation could pose a real risk to profitability in the future, reports TJI. It points out that, as cigarette advertising is banned in the UK, packs have become more elaborate as they are the best way manufacturers can promote their brands and distinguish them from rival products. </p> <p>In an insight into the industry's finances, the journal says: 'While the cost of production is roughly the same for both and, according to analysts, the difference in quality is barely perceptible, the profit margin of premium brands is considerably higher than that of low-priced cigarettes.' </p> <p>The Health Department recently closed its consultation on a raft of measures to reduce the number of smokers even further, which has fallen to 22 per cent of the adult population. They include plain packaging, banning cigarettes from public displays in shops, outlawing packs of 10 and getting rid of vending machines. </p> <p>It received even more responses than the 55,000 it got before last year's public smoking ban. Most respondents supported the plans, including plain packaging. </p> <p>Deborah Arnott, director of health campaigning charity Ash, hailed plain packing as 'an idea whose time has come. The industry knows that plain packs spell the death knell to industry profitability,' she said. 'The industry cannot survive without recruiting replacements for the 100,000 UK citizens its products kill each year. Most of these new smokers are children and young people, who our research shows find plain packs much less attractive.' </p> <p>The tobacco industry argues that the moves will lead to a rise in cigarette smuggling, more counterfeiting of tobacco products and will threaten small retailers' livelihoods.</p>",
  "<p>If, like me, you are a child of the Seventies, you'll remember being clad almost exclusively in synthetic-fibred pyjamas, despite their obvious lack of breathability. Early examples of imported, low-cost, branded sleepwear, they usually featured cartoon characters. My character of choice was Busby - the yellow poster bird for British Telecom - at least I was supporting a public utility. Contemporary parental concerns focus on the toxicity of kids' stuff including recent concern over high levels of formaldehyde (applied to apparel to prevent mildew) in Chinese imports. But back in the Seventies it was all about house fires. We were put to bed in synthetics largely because these fabrics were fire retardant. Flammability standards effectively killed off natural fibres.</p> <p>They only returned when concerns arose about the nature and stability of flame retardants themselves. A few were found to be carcinogenic and banned, and natural fibres were allowed to be sold for kids' sleepwear as long as items were 'snug fit', less likely to catch alight than a billowing garment. Henceforth parents must choose between exposing their child to low-level chemical residues or the remote chance that there might be a fire and they'll be clad in non-retardant organic cotton. </p> <p>In truth, unless you cultivate, process and weave your own hemp, it's difficult to have a pure wardrobe. For starters, clothes are routinely treated for transit. Also, most eco labels focus on minimising pesticide-use in fibre - useful environmentally - but don't cover chemicals applied during dyeing and finishing (<a href=\"http://www.tshirtandsons.co.uk\">tshirtandsons.co.uk</a> is a rare example of a company that minimises chemicals throughout the chain).</p> <p>'Manufacturers aren't deliberately using Napalm or plutonium in textiles,' stresses UK textile and dyeing specialist Phil Patterson, 'but because of price pressures, producers are outsourcing to less reputable dye houses using sub-standard or banned dyes.' Technically, when these clothes enter the UK they are 'illegal', but only a tiny fraction of clothes are toxicity tested. Your options then are to go for certified organic fibre retailers (such as <a href=\"http://www.gossypium.co.uk\">gossypium.co.uk</a>) that still have reasonable control over their supply lines; garments that are not dyed at all (<a href=\"http://www.luxuryredefined.co.uk\">luxuryredefined.co.uk</a>); or even naturally coloured cotton (<a href=\"http://www.naturalcolourcotton.com\">naturalcolourcotton.com</a>). Dark dyes are far worse than light and there's a case to be made for washing before you wear.</p> <p>The real risks are taken by, as Patterson puts it, 'the poor people in backstreet dye houses predominantly in Asia who are carrying buckets containing carcinogenic dyes who end up with bladder cancer'. Our risk as consumers is comparatively small. But it is hardly non-existent. Just ask the poor nurse who bought a tummy tucker 'foundation garment' from a well-known, value, high street retailer last year and had a near fatal allergic reaction. That is the definition of pants.</p> <h2>Do the right thing</h2> <p>Power showers can use more water than a bath.

  "<p>While now is a good time to rein back on spending, many consumers may be cutting back on the very financial products designed to protect them from economic turbulence.</p> <p>Analysis by American Express Insurance Services shows that many Britons are sacrificing insurance products to save money, with 27 per cent planning to cut back on health insurance and 17 per cent of pet owners prepared to sacrifice cover for their pets.</p> <p>Chris Rolland, head of Amex Insurance Services, says: 'It is worrying that people are planning to cut back on the policies that are designed to protect them during hard times.'</p> <p>Because there are so many different insurance products - mortgage payment protection, critical illness, life insurance, health insurance and so on - it can be tempting to cancel some of them to release money to pay rising utility bills and food prices. 'Think twice before you cancel your basic insurance policies, and seek professional advice where you can,' says Tony Solomon, business development director at Zurich. 'What you cancel today may affect you and your family in the long-term.'</p> <p>Solomon says critical illness and life insurance are two types of cover that must not be sacrificed. 'If you were to fall seriously ill or to die, by cancelling your cover you could be leaving your family without a roof over their heads.'</p> <p>If you are struggling to meet monthly premiums, talk to your insurance provider to see if there is some way of cutting the cost, such as temporarily reducing the amount of cover. </p> <p>Some insurance policies are unavoidable: you are required by law to hold a car insurance policy, while mortgage lenders will require buildings insurance to be in place. Other products, such as household contents and pet policies, are not compulsory - but you can shop around to save money rather than not buying them at all.</p> <p>Graeme Trudgill of the British Insurance Brokers' Association says: 'A lot of people don't realise how much they've spent on their possessions and you should have contents insurance to protect them. There are different levels of cover, and you may not need all you're paying for.' The average annual cost of contents insurance is about \u00a3149, but Trudgill says it's possible to save 25 per cent by dropping personal-possessions and accidental damage cover.</p> <p>Pet insurance may seem unnecessary, but it's preferable to the expensive vet's fees you might otherwise have to find in an emergency. So which policies are safe to ditch? When it comes to health insurance, Solomon says: 'Many people get health insurance from their employer. If you don't and you are paying for a policy, it's more important that you have a policy that protects your family's future financially.' In other words, a product such as critical illness cover, which provides a payout rather than private medical treatment or mortgage protection.</p> <p>Trudgill says there are some insurance policies that are 'really questionable', such as mobile phone insurance: 'The handset might already be covered by your home insurance.'</p>",
  "<p>A little-known part of the compensation system could see bank and building society customers lose control of their savings if they have both loans and deposits with a financial institution that goes bust. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) will normally refund depositors up to \u00a335,000 if their bank or building society fails, but it says that if a saver also has a mortgage with that bank or building society, the customer's savings could be taken and used to pay off the loan.</p> <p>Suzette Browne, a spokeswoman for the FSCS, says: 'In the event of a bank going into default, the FSCS would consider the overall net claim. If the claimant's borrowing exceeded their savings, there would be no overall claim against the bank and the claimant would not be entitled to any compensation.' </p> <p>This means that if a customer had a mortgage of \u00a3200,000 and savings of \u00a3150,000 with the same bank, a 'set-off' would be applied by the insolvency practitioner dealing with the bank failure. In this example, she says, 'the individual would end up owing the bank \u00a350,000, so there would be no positive balance and no claim [for compensation].' </p> <p>If the customer has more savings than debt with the bank, he or she could claim for compensation up to the \u00a335,000 FSCS limit. </p> <p>The situation is more complicated if the mortgage bank is part of a larger banking group and the customer has further savings in other parts of that group. Browne says it would then depend on the terms and conditions of the offsetting bank as to whether the insolvency practitioner could use those savings to reduce the mortgage.</p> <p>Building societies set different terms and conditions for their offset mortgages, so a customer's savings might or might not be automatically offset against his outstanding mortgage if the building society failed. In the latter case the saver would still have to claim any money back through the FSCS.</p> <p>In the past, it was traditional for people who wanted to borrow a mortgage to save with an institution before asking to borrow a loan from it too. This practice has become less common over the last 20 years, with the introduction of specialist lenders which raised their money through the money markets rather than by taking in savers' deposits, and savings banks such as IceSave which offer high rates of interest on deposits but do not lend mortgages.</p> <p>But offset mortgages, which combine mortgage loans, savings accounts and in some cases current accounts to reduce the overall amount of interest paid, would almost certainly be affected. These loans allow borrowers to set savings against debt, effectively reducing the size of their mortgage without tying up savings on a permanent basis, and the ability to access their savings if needed is an important aspect of offset loans for many borrowers. Most lending institutions promote them on the basis of their flexibility, enabling the borrower to take out, say, \u00a314,000 to pay school fees or fund an house extension without having to remortgage.</p> <p>But despite the possible loss of control over savings, David Hollingworth of mortgage brokers London &amp; Country still believes having savings and a mortgage with the same institution offers borrowers valuable protection. 'Provided your savings are no bigger than your mortgage, you will not lose your money - it will just be used to reduce the size of your debt. If you really need access to the money again, you can always remortgage.'</p> <p>Offset mortgages were only introduced to the UK 10 years ago. However, the year-on-year popularity of offset mortgages has been much stronger than conventional loans, rising by 49 per cent between April 2006 and March 2007. In 2006 (the most recent figures available from the Council of Mortgage Lenders), offset mortgages accounted for loans totalling \u00a323.9bn, or 7 per cent of all new home lending.</p> <p>Intelligent Finance, a subsidiary of HBOS, specialises in offset mortgages. Its spokesman Ross Cory said: 'In terms of a bank failure, the scheme is untested and undergoing review.'</p>",
  "<p>This article states that Sainsbury's bank is part of the HBOS banking licence and that if you hold money with Sainsbury's and Halifax, you will only be covered once up to \u00a335,000 under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. This is incorrect - Sainsbury's is licenced separately from all other HBOS brands, so any money that you do have with Sainsbury's will be covered up to \u00a335,000 regardless of how much money you have in Halifax. We apologise for printing the wrong information.</p> <p> </p> <p>There is no doubt now that the financial crisis, which started as distant concerns over investment banks in the US, will have a deep and lasting effect on the finances of the British public.</p> <p>Every household will have been touched in some way. Difficulties in getting a mortgage, negative equity, tumbling share prices and redundancy have already reared their heads. Recall of overdrafts and other forms of credit - and soaring repossessions and bankruptcies - are likely to follow.</p> <p>In this week's Cash section we address the immediate issues that may be worrying you and explain how to shore up your finances. Here we examine the main areas that have been affected, and over the page we answer readers' questions about the crisis. We aim to do the same next week.</p> <h2>Shares</h2> <p>'It is not the return on your money that you have to worry about, but the return of your money.' So says Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown. But his clients seem not to agree: HL has been inundated with people wanting to open dealing accounts, largely to buy shares in HBOS and the other bombed-out banks. </p> <p>You should only join them if you are prepared to endure a 'white-knuckle ride', says Jeremy Batstone, head of research at Charles Stanley, and have a 'high risk tolerance'. 'If it is money you can ill afford to lose, you have to be careful,' he warns.</p> <p>He expects volatility to continue until regulators have re-established control. 'The Fed [US Federal Reserve] is still just reacting to market pressure: that was what forced the [crises at] AIG, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.' While each of these events sparked a rally in shares, they quickly started to fall again. Until there are 'clear signs' the Fed is getting on top of events, he says, speculators will continue to hunt for the next victim.</p> <p>Gavin Oldham, chief executive of The Share Centre, expects the volatility to continue for much of the autumn. 'As we go towards the end of the year, the market will start to find its confidence and go forward again. For the moment, the market is only for the day. Shares could still go 15 or even 20 per cent lower.'</p> <p>But Sam Morse, manager of Fidelity's Moneybuilder Growth Fund, urges investors not to panic-sell. 'This may be like shutting the stable door after the horses have bolted, and any attempt to time the market is fraught with risk. Growth in dividend payments is far more reliable than rises in share prices and even through the turmoil of the past decade, total returns from UK shares have held up - provided that you reinvested your dividends.'</p> <h2>Pensions</h2> <p>Tumbling stock markets have brought final-salary pension fund deficits into focus again: in the last week alone, these have swollen by around \u00a320bn and have grown by \u00a350bn over the last year. But those lucky enough to still be members of final-salary schemes need not worry about their retirement income: the companies operating them are committed to providing the promised level of pension. That means most schemes are now closed to new members, and many to existing ones too.</p> <p>Those with private or money-purchase pensions will, once again, be receiving letters showing a fall in the value of their fund. Dampier says that if you have 15 to 20 years until retirement, you should not worry: 'You should actually be putting in more, if you can afford it, as the units you are buying will be much cheaper.'</p> <p>The market's gyrations could be more worrying for those closer to retirement. Savers should start switching their investments away from risky shares to bonds and cash at least five years ahead of their target retirement date. Anyone who has not done this faces the choice of cashing in their pension at rock-bottom levels or deferring retirement. </p> <p>Even the latter option is not pain-free. Apart from the uncertainty about when the stock market will stabilise, annuity rates fall further if, as expected, the Bank of England starts to cut base rates. That means the monthly pension your pot can buy will shrink.</p> <h2>Mortgages</h2> <p>When the credit crunch first hit a year ago, confidence vanished from the UK mortgage market, rates went up and the size of loans on offer shrank. However, in the past few weeks confidence had begun to return and rates had dropped by over 0.5 per cent on some loans. Now, however, the outlook for borrowers is less than rosy once again. </p> <p>Libor rates, the lending rate between UK banks, shot up on the news of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This means the liquidity squeeze has deepened again, and lenders could soon start withdrawing cheap deals and either not replace them, or substitute them for more expensive rates. </p> <p>Swap rates, which determine the price of fixed-rate mortgages, also soared last week. Melanie Bien, of mortgage brokers Savills Private Finance, says: 'This heightened threat to lenders' confidence is likely to push swap rates higher still, which means new mortgage rates will rise again.'</p> <p>Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol agrees. 'I do think the rules of the game have changed since last weekend. On the basis that mortgage finance might get significantly worse, I think there is a strong argument for anyone looking to remortgage in the next six months to sort out a deal now.'</p> <p>Boulger suggests that because interest rates are very likely to fall late this year and next year, a tracker mortgage, mirroring the Bank of England rate movements, still offers the best value. However, fixed-rate mortgages come with the benefit of certainty, so will still appeal to many borrowers. </p> <h2>Savers and savings</h2> <p>Memories of the Northern Rock collapse were haunting savers last week - but they are being urged not to panic.</p> <p>Kevin Mountford, head of savings at Moneysupermarket.com, says: 'The worst thing that could happen is that customers panic and create a run on the banks. An institution like HBOS is a strong business and has strong deposits and it is not likely that it will disappear.'</p> <p>In the unlikely event of a savings provider going bankrupt, savers are covered up to the first \u00a335,000 (per saver, per institution) under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). If you have more than \u00a335,000 in savings, you should consider spreading the money. You should check providers aren't part of the same banking licence (for instance, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury's Finance and Birmingham Midshires are all part of HBOS), as the FSCS will only cover your savings to a total of \u00a335,000 across all parts of one organisation.</p> <p>On the up side, the savings market is strong. Michelle Slade, analyst at Moneyfacts.co.uk, says: 'Savers are likely to find themselves in the best position, as last time [a bank collapsed] banks struggled to raise funds on the money markets and turned to their savings books to fund mortgages. Savers were tempted by rates over 0.5 per cent higher than we would normally expect to see when the base rate is at 5 per cent. Rates are still higher than usual and could go even higher.'</p> <p>Mountford says it is likely savers will see more soaring rates on fixed-rate bonds in particular, many of which are already paying over 7 per cent. 'There are some great rates around as institutions are desperate for deposits. It's still safer to have your money in a savings account than in a biscuit tin, after all.'</p> <p>But with inflation up to 4.7 per cent, basic rate taxpayers need to be earning at least 5.9 per cent on any taxable savings to beat tax and inflation. Higher rate taxpayers would need to be getting 7.9 per cent. According to Mountford, the leading savings accounts are Alliance &amp; Leicester's easy-access eSaver, which pays 6.56 per cent; ICICI's HiSave one-year bond at 7.2 per cent; and Leeds building society's 'inflation buster bond' which is paying 7.25 per cent interest. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Next week we will be answering questions about the credit crisis and what you can do to stave off its impact.

  "<p>Some of the people who cooked up the financial crisis that hit the UK this week have already lost their jobs. More will follow in the next few weeks.</p> <p>They should be fine. Investment bankers have had more than a decade of good returns and enormous bonuses. The attitude among some of them is surprise that they have been allowed to get away with their shenanigans for so long. It's the rest of us - including the thousands of ordinary middle managers and branch staff at HBOS and Lloyds TSB - that will really suffer if we are made redundant. But it's not too late to protect yourself against this eventuality. </p> <p>First, take out insurance to replace your income in the event of redundancy - at least enough to cover your mortgage. Shop around and make sure you meet the policy's terms for a payment, and check that you can manage the 'excess period' - the time you will have to make ends meet before the insurance kicks in. A quick look on Moneysupermarket.com shows that a 45-year-old earning \u00a340,000 a year, and needing cover for his \u00a3800-a-month mortgage, would pay a premium of \u00a310.40 a month if he could afford to pay the mortgage himself for the first 120 days of redundancy, but \u00a332 if he needed the insurance to pay out immediately.</p> <p>Next, try to cut back on your spending and reduce your debts: you know what to do.</p> <p>When you've done that, it's imperative to build up a cash 'safety net'. The rule of thumb used to be three months' salary. If your savings amount to more than \u00a335,000, make sure you spread your money between different banking groups. This limit is likely to rise to \u00a350,000 by the end of October, but don't take any chances in the meantime. A lot could happen during the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>The news that your savings could be used to pay off your mortgage if you hold them with the same financial institution and it goes bust will probably come as a shock to most readers. None of the financial experts (apart from those at the Financial Services Compensation Scheme) that I talked to this week knew about it - but then it hasn't exactly been a burning issue before.</p> <p>As there is no apparent end in sight to this chaos, this is something that needs thinking about. If you want to retain control over your savings, and they are stored in the same bank as your mortgage, it might be a good idea to move them as soon as possible.</p> <p>Bear in mind, though, that if your bank does collapse, you won't be losing your savings so much as reducing your debt.</p>",
  "<p>Her books have shocked, titillated, appalled and delighted readers for more than a decade. She has been condemned as a self-obsessed, navel-gazing publicity hound, who represents all that has gone wrong with French fiction, and lionised as a courageous writer challenging social and creative taboos and suffering for her bravery. But never before has a work by Christine Angot, labelled the queen of 'auto-fiction', suffered the indignity of being judged boring.</p> <p>Angot's latest work - Le march\u00e9 des amants (The lover market) - recounts her recent relationship with a fading rapper, Bruno Beausire, more usually known by his lurid stage name, Doc Gyn\u00e9co. More than 300 pages long, liberally peppered with references to her lover's frustrated proclivity for sodomy, and featuring lengthy passages describing sex in a lift, discussions over whether or not to go for a coffee or who will call whom later, the book is the first of Angot's 14 works to be destroyed by the literary critics.</p> <p>'She has been lynched,' said Christophe Ono-dit-Biot, author and culture editor of Le Point magazine. 'It's very French. We build them up and then suddenly we decide to trample them into the dirt,' she explained.</p> <p>The attacks have undoubtedly been ferocious. Critic Christine Ferniot, writing in Lire magazine, described The Lover Market as 'dry, grey and boring... a B-series film with a Richard Clayderman soundtrack.' For J\u00e9rome Dupuis, in the weekly L'Express, the book was 'a long woolly text stuffed with inept conversations.'</p> <p>Though - or perhaps because - Doc Gyn\u00e9co controversially supported the right-wing President, Nicolas Sarkozy, in last year's election, the criticism has cut across political divides. An appalling review in the left-wing Le Nouvel Observateur was followed by worse in the influential intellectual Telerama listings magazine. Its critic described the book as a 'banal compilation of insignificant dialogues'.</p> <p>But for some observers the row is rooted more in the social tensions and prejudices of French society than in any literary flaws in Angot's latest work. The book's title is taken from one sentence - 'on the lover market, a black is worth less than a white'. Jean-Pierre Boul\u00e9, professor of contemporary French studies at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'The reaction has been so virulent because... what Angot, 49, is talking about is deeply shocking in the new conservative climate [in France].'</p> <p>Most of the polemics about the book have certainly focused on the relationship between Doc Gyn\u00e9co, who is from a poor suburban background, and the white middle-class writer. Some have even described it as a 'misalliance'.</p> <p>Her defenders point out that earlier books in which Angot described having sex respectively with her father, an elderly banker and figures from the cultural world have all been critically lauded.</p> <p>'It seems that this is one taboo that you can't transgress,' said Ono-dit-Biot. 'Doc Gyn\u00e9co himself is actually quite sympathetic, and though it might be a bit soppy the book is a rather nice love story. Angot's the girl from the good bourgeois family who ran off with the gardener. So she's been taken apart.'</p> <p>Angot refuses the title 'queen of auto-fiction', despite being described as such by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its official website. But some have seen her fall from grace as a sign that 'auto-fiction', a largely French literary genre that consists of using one's own slightly disguised experience as a basis for a narrative in which fact and fiction are mixed without clear distinction, has had its day.</p> <p>One of the major successes of this autumn has been a book advertised explicitly as 'not auto-fiction', in which a character condemns the genre as being defined as 'the more I speak, the more I am right ... I speak and it's called a book'.</p> <p>The best-selling author Michel Houellebecq, whose last book and the film based on it were both panned, is the latest proponent of the genre to fall foul of the critics. But Philippe Lan\u00e7on, literary critic of Lib\u00e9ration newspaper, pointed out that a lengthy new work by author Catherine Millet, whose account of her adulterous sex sessions with multiple anonymous partners became a global bestseller six years ago, has been well received. Millet's new book, Day of Suffering, recounts her own jealousy within her marriage, her masturbatory fantasies and sessions with her psychologists.</p> <p>'The problem with Angot's latest is what she says, not how she says it, Lan\u00e7on told The Observer. 'Millet's latest is very stylised, much more educated. The reader is among educated people and it's much less shocking,' he said.</p> <p>This year's autumnal crop of literary offerings includes 676 novels, of which 210 are foreign translations. Stars include David Lodge's Deaf Sentence and Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach, which was third on the French bestseller list last week.</p> <p>'They are the kind of books that the French are no longer producing: well-written, humorous, satirical with bite in the one case; beautiful storytelling that perfectly conjures a historical moment in the other,' said Boul\u00e9. 'There is a longing for such works.'</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday September 28 2008</strong></p> <p>The article below was accompanied by the panel: 'Prawn cocktail: The chemicals used in one Vietnamese prawn pond'. The substances listed were from research into chemical traces found in prawns around the world, not just in Vietnam. Two of those listed, chloramphenicol and nitrofurans, are banned in Vietnam.</p> <p> </p> <p>There's no lack of building materials around the prawn ponds of the Mekong Delta. Walls are constructed of the empty plastic sacks of pesticides and prawn feed. It's cheap, but sweaty. Southern Vietnam is hot and sticky at any time and the humid air inside the Huong family's one-room hut, perched on a prawn-pond dyke, is rank with chemicals: we cough and sneeze when we enter. There's an acrid dust all over the mud floor, which makes you worry for little Huong Thi Mai, who is seven, a patient little girl sitting on the low bed near the door watching her parents work. I glance at her bare shins for signs of the skin infections that are common among prawn-farm workers, but she looks OK. </p> <p>Mr Huong is proud: 'This is a very modern prawn-farming business,' he says. And, with luck and four months' hard labour, it is going to make him and his family quite rich. After they've paid their debts, the Huongs hope to buy a moped and their first fridge. Thi Mai might go to a new school. 'We can have a better life,' says Mrs Huong. But until the tiger prawns are ready for harvest, and shipped off to Europe or America, the family must live here, keeping a 24-hour watch beside the sour-smelling pond. They've borrowed \u00a34,000, a huge sum, to invest in prawn larvae, feed and medicines - and they need to keep alert in case anyone steals the growing crustaceans.</p> <p>Modernity, for Mr Huong, appears to be chiefly measured in chemicals. I count 13 different pots, jars and sacks of these in the hut, and he eagerly talks me through them. He's particularly keen on a compound called 'Super Star' - the Vietnamese print on the label says it 'intensifies the metabolism to help prawns grow fat'. He learnt about this additive on a government-run course at the local fishery training centre. 'We're not allowed to use much - only 10 bottles per crop,' he says.</p> <p>There are other glossy labels - most of them for products made in Thailand, the centre of the world's prawn farming industry. Mr Huong mixes up a feed in a big white basin while we talk. The basic feed, he says, is soya, broken rice and fish and prawn parts. But in it goes a large dose of 'Amino-Pro'. 'It will help the shrimp taste better,' he says. The label has familiar words from stock- cube packets: aspartic acid, glutamic acid and taurine, which is the key element of the energy drink Red Bull. Then there is Vitamix, 'to make prawns grow faster', Calphorax 'to help the shell thicken and give better colour' and Vin Superclear 'to kill pest, virus and smell'. And on top is a seasoning of antibiotic.</p> <p>Prawn farming is an ancient activity in tropical countries. Coastal peoples in Indonesia and Vietnam have trapped young marine prawns in brackish ponds for at least 500 years, feeding them up with fish scraps and household waste to eat or sell. The prawns, properly farmed, are sweet and juicy: it's a lucrative business. The larvae can reach marketable size, as long as your hand, in as little as four months. But the trade has changed utterly since black tiger prawns (known as 'shrimp' in most countries) and bamboo prawns became a routine luxury in the rich world in the 1990s. The ancient cottage industry was swiftly industrialised. Around the tropical belt, from Ecuador to Indonesia, coastal farmers punched holes in the sea defences and let salt water into their paddy fields for the gold rush.</p> <p>As with salmon, coffee and a host of other once rare and expensive foods, the demand from rich countries brought more and more producers into the market. Fifty tropical countries are now exporting large farmed prawn. Tiger or 'king' prawns and their siblings have become a staple of supermarket fish counters. The result - it's so familiar, it is almost a law of economics - has been ever-falling prices, increasing use of chemicals, dropping quality. And, of course, scares. Shipments of prawn from the tropics are regularly refused by governmental testers in Europe and America. The chemicals used in a production system that packs 20 of these wild animals into one square metre of foul, endlessly recycled water have been shown again and again to harm the workers, the environment and possibly the consumers. What's surprising, perhaps, is that we are still in love with them. </p> <p>And we do eat a lot of them. 'King prawns to overtake burgers as barbecue food,' ran a news story last month. Tropical farmed prawns are now Britain's fifth most popular fish. Sales were up 14 per cent last year - and we now spend \u00a3169 million a year on them, four times as much as we spend on frozen burgers. At one supermarket which has seen a 20 per cent increase in sales, a spokesperson told me that tropical prawns are 'so fashionable' because they are 'a light and healthy option'. Enthusiastic endorsement from celebrity chefs has boosted the boom - recently Gordon Ramsay has salivated over king prawn and wonton soup on The F Word and Jamie Oliver told viewers to skewer them with bay leaves and lemon slices for the barbecue. Barbecued prawns with a saffron aioli appeared in The Observer's barbecue guide last month.</p> <p>Light and healthy? I think about this as we follow Mr Huong through a litter of silicate sacks and empty prawn-feed bags to the pond. It measures 400 square metres, about two tennis courts. It was once the family's ancestral rice paddy, and at this time of year the growing seedlings should be turning the landscape a brilliant yellow-green. But the pond, and all the others nearby, is now a viscous grey, like old washing-up water.</p> <p>Mr Huong paddles off in a little flat boat, scattering the feed we saw him mix up earlier. A system of paddle wheels, driven by a diesel engine, lies ready to stir up the water and bring oxygen to the shellfish packed beneath. There are 80,000 of them below the surface. Back on the dyke, he dips a flat net into the opaque water, and pulls up a few of the animals to weigh them and inspect them for deformities. They are two months old, about the size of my index finger. The translucent beige creatures wriggle and jump like busy grasshoppers. </p> <p>The Huongs, like all their neighbours, opened the dykes and turned to prawn farming because of the fantastic profits available. A field that would have once provided enough rice for the family to eat, and a little extra to sell for essentials, has suddenly become an asset with the potential to change their lives. If this crop is successful the Huongs will sell the grown prawns for \u00a38,000 - if prices hold up - after only four months.</p> <p>This is an enormous amount in a country where many rural people still survive on less than \u00a31 a day. As a result, many of the rice farmers of Tra Vinh have now become chemists, experts in the complex biology of intensively farmed crustaceans. Across the dykes we see men and women in their conical hats dipping test tubes in the water, testing acidity levels, examining prawns in the test nets for the dreaded signals of disease: reddening shells, misshapen bodies, white spots on their legs. They are trained and encouraged by the Vietnamese government, which, through promoting cash crops like this one, has been uniquely successful in Asia at increasing Vietnam's exports and reducing poverty in the country. </p> <p>But there are calamities that can't be sorted out with science. If anything goes wrong the family will lose all their investment, and they won't have any rice to eat either. If they borrowed the money for the prawn larvae, they'll lose their land, too. Things happen here. This coastline along the South China Sea is prone to typhoons, which will destroy all the farmers' work in a night. The coastal mangrove forests, which once offered some protection to the people of these marginal lands, have been uprooted in many prawn farming areas across the tropics - the bandwagon of the shellfish gold rush has destroyed even these crucial natural barricades to the ocean.</p> <p>The prawns, packed in the ponds, are terribly prone to illness. The last batch of prawn larvae all died after one month - the Huongs don't know why. White-spot virus almost killed off the industry in Vietnam two years ago. And, having gambled everything on prawns, people will of course do anything to protect their investment. That includes using any chemicals that may seem to help. 'Often we get consignments of antibiotics for human use, which are past the date they can be used by,' a village headman told me. It is well known that use of antibiotics can stimulate growth.</p> <p>This is a temporary land, on loan from the ocean. It's tidy, almost Dutch, with its network of carefully constructed dykes and endless bridges, the South China Sea a pressing presence behind a row of raggedy firs. The mangrove forests have been replanted, after education work with the local communities, by Oxfam and the Vietnamese authorities. On the main road there's a sign, as big as an advertising billboard. Under a vivid picture of jars and bottles and dead prawns it lists all the chemicals that prawn farmers must not use: 51 of them. They include many human antibiotics, penicillins, and some names I recognise from the bad days of the European fish-farming industry - nitrofuran, chloramphenicol and organophosphate pesticides.</p> <p>It's impressive and it shows the real efforts the Vietnamese government has been taking to educate farmers, reduce use of dangerous chemicals and improve quality. After all, export of farmed fish is worth $3.6 billion annually to the country. One government official said to me: 'We know Western people are suspicious of our seafood. There were scandals in 2002 that nearly destroyed our markets. So it is in our interest to keep quality high and reduce the use of chemicals.' And prawn farming has changed the face of Tra Vinh province. So much richer has the boom made this isolated corner of the Mekong's great delta that Oxfam will shortly end its long-standing poverty-reduction programmes.</p> <p>'Shrimp has made this province rich,' the official said. And you can see it. Houses have televisions and mopeds outside them. School enrolment rates have soared. Five years after the scandals that nearly turned Europe off warm-water prawn, Vietnam's exports of the shellfish increased by 32 per cent last year. In Britain we're eating three times as many tropical prawns as we were five years ago - and the price of them has halved. </p> <p>I ran the long list of chemicals we found past Peter Bridson, who is in charge of aquaculture at the Soil Association. He oversees the policing of the salmon farms in Scotland which, controversially, the Soil Association decided three years ago to certify as organic. Nothing we had found in Vietnam surprised him. 'This is what you see again and again in industrial aquaculture. There's a get- rich-quick attitude, everyone follows the boom. But then, one false step, and it crashes. And disease is usually the problem.'</p> <p>Most of the chemicals we photographed in Mr Huong's shed are pesticides, feed enhancers and growth stimulants. 'These types of products are commonly used in Asian hatcheries,' says Bridson, who has worked in tropical fish farming. 'The farmers experiment. Someone chucks something in his tanks and gets good results. He tells his mates and the use of this product becomes mainstream in the area - whether it actually does anything or not.'</p> <p>Mr Huong's Super Star contains a chemical commonly used as a 'nutritional enhancer'. It is marketed by the company Bayer in Europe as 'Butaphosphan'. On Bayer's website all I can find is a recommendation that it be used for injecting into sheep, dogs and cats suffering from 'stress, overexertion or exhaustion' and as a tonic in cases of weakness or anaemia in animals. (Bayer does not supply the chemical in Vietnam nor market it as a 'nutritional enhancer'.) </p> <p>The problem is that some chemicals may do more harm than good - and not just to the image of the tropical prawn. Super Star also contains methyl hydroxybenzoate, an anti-fungal preservative that is banned in France and Australia and has been linked to cancer in some beauty treatments. The most dubious thing we found in the Huong's arsenal of chemicals was in a pot named 'N300'. It is a 'medicine for digestion and liver function', made by a Vietnamese company called Cong Ty TNHH. It had beta glucan, a harmless component of many human nutrition supplements, but also norfloxacin, an antibiotic usually used to treat gonorrhea and urinary-tract infections in humans. It is currently 'under watch' by the US Federal Drug Administration because of increased reports of nasty side effects, including damage to tendons. </p> <p>Norfloxacin and its siblings, the fluoroquinolones, are banned for use in animals for human consumption in the States, and subject to EU controls in imports. Misuse of the fluoroquinolones is increasingly blamed for the rise in resistance to anti-bacterial medicines, and five floxacins are listed on the poster of banned chemicals we saw at the entrance to the village. Since 2005 Vietnam's fishery ministry has banned the use of fluoroquinolones in fish destined for the North American market, but not, apparently, for European countries. From the pile of empty N300 jars we saw, there is a lot of fluoroquinolone going into the feed for Mr Huong's prawns.</p> <p>Numerous surveys have been done on the effects of the antibiotics that are used in prawn farming across the world (31 different ones were identified in Vietnam in a 2006 study, among a total 155 different drugs). They conclude that, although the antibiotics may rise to detectable levels in the bodies of the prawn, the most likely damage is being done to the environment in which they're farmed. It's Thi Mai who may have problems when doctors try to treat her for skin complaints, diarrhoea, respiratory problems and other bacterial infections, including malaria, which is common in this swampy landscape. They may find that she is resistant to the antibiotics. Scientists have speculated that some unusual outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in Europe and the States may have been started by antibiotic-resistant salmonella in farmed fish from Asia.</p> <p>And the leakage of antibiotics and pesticides into the delicate ecosystem in the coastal shallows of the shrimp-farming countries will have effects that no one yet fully understands. Peter Bridson worries that the chemicals will intensify, because the water system is closed, with water being reused from one farm to another, and for human consumption. David Moriarty, a scientist at the University of Queensland who has studied the wide-scale use of norfloxacin and other anti-bacterials in aquaculture wrote nine years ago of disturbing effects in prawn farms in the Philippines: 'Many of the pathogens appear to have mutated to more virulent forms than were present a decade ago ... I feel that the incidence of disease has been exacerbated by the actions of the [prawn] farmers.' Moriarty now works promoting probiotics to tropical prawn farmers, as an alternative to lacing the waters with chemicals. </p> <p>The Soil Association, meanwhile, which is currently processing applications to be certified organic from several tropical prawn farms, has decided not to allow any use of antibiotics in prawn-growing farms that want to carry its label. The Vietnamese, meanwhile, are working hard to police the use of antibiotics and other chemicals better. VASEP, the prawn exporters' and producers' organisation, points out that 25 new licences were granted to Vietnamese processors by the EU in January 2008, an endorsement of the fisheries ministry's 'urgent efforts' to improve sanitary and safety standards in the prawn industry. </p> <p>So is that it for tiger prawn kebabs? How worried should we prawn lovers be? Well, norfloxacin is used by countless other farmers in Asia, but it is not illegal in most of those countries (though I could not find it on Vietnam's lengthy list of approved chemicals). There are increasing environmental fears about its overuse, and worries over the effect on human health of all the quinolones. But unless you have a serious king-prawn habit, you are unlikely to ingest anything like a human dose of norfloxacin. </p> <p>Food &amp; Water Watch, an American NGO that has studied prawn farming for 10 years, states in its latest report: 'The negative effects of eating industrially produced shrimp may include neurological damage from ingesting chemicals such as endosulfans, an allergic response to penicillin residues or infection by an antibiotic-resistant pathogen such as E coli.' That is a judicious 'may': a rational person in this age of food scares would have to conclude you're unlikely to suffer more ill effects from eating farmed prawns than from any other industrially produced food animal. But I wouldn't eat them every day. </p> <p>It is certain, however, that banned or controlled chemicals are coming into the country with farmed prawns, despite the promises of governments and the retailers. Last year the EU rejected shipments of farmed prawn from six major exporters in India because they contained chloramphenicol and nitrofurans - two once-common antibiotics, one now known to cause leukaemia, the other a carcinogen. </p> <p>The EU claims that this shows its regulations work, but the fact remains that the EU is thought to test only around one per cent of such shipments. America imports $3.9 billion worth of farmed prawn (or shrimp, as its known there) a year, yet tests hardly more of the shipments than does the EU. All the same, it rejected 2,817 shipments of seafood in 2005, most of them farmed 'shrimp'. And in Louisiana, a shrimp-producing region which conducts its own tests on imports, chloramphenicol was found in nine per cent of all foreign shrimp shipments in 2007. </p> <p>I'm grateful to Taras Grescoe for that last piece of information. His fascinating new book, Bottomfeeder, describes the mad and scary practices of the fishing industry in nauseating detail. Grescoe says he thinks farmed prawn is the most disgusting of all the industrial farmed products - worse than salmon, worse than battery chicken. And he won't eat them.</p> <p>It's not just the chemicals that turned him off. The land grab for prawn farms that has destroyed the mangrove forest has harmed wild animals and humans too. Seventy per cent of Ecuador's mangrove has gone. Rights to land are well-established in Vietnam, for women and men, but in other tropical countries there are disturbing reports of abuse of coastal peoples by big business cashing in on the boom. Food &amp; Water Watch has visited one district of Andhra Pradesh in India where 2,000 families have become 'shrimp refugees', displaced by big corporations who wanted their land for prawn farms.</p> <p>Unlike Grescoe, though, I'm not going to stop eating the prawns. That's too easy. Going on farmed-prawn strike won't hurt the villains in this story. They are, as in any tale of shipping the foods of the poor world to the rich in bulk, the big corporations, the processors and the retailers. They would survive a collapse of the industry - the people who won't are the poor coastal fishermen of Vietnam and 50 other countries, for whom prawn farming is proving a way out of poverty. These people have risked much to satisfy our demand for exotic seafood - there's no way back when you flood your family's rice paddy with seawater for tiger prawns. The salt from the water will make it impossible to grow rice again for years. </p> <p>There are other ways to help them. Oxfam, which has been working in Tra Vinh for 10 years, is helping some of the farmers set up co-operatives and loan schemes to make traditional fishing and farming more lucrative: we visited villages where the whole community has become partners in a cockle-fishing enterprise. Its sustainable, it creates jobs and it's doing well.</p> <p>But to make a difference across the tropics, we customers must demand better prawns, raised organically and in a way that's good for them and the people who farm them. We have to be prepared to pay more for them. On my desk I have a 212g box from my local supermarket of uncooked peeled king prawns from Vietnam, which I found on sale at a two-for-\u00a35 deal. That means the 60 or so prawns cost me about 12p each - after shelling, freezing, packing and shipping. That is just two pence more than Mr Huong hoped to sell his prawns for. It's not enough. The price is the same for trawled wild prawns from the North Atlantic.</p> <p>Bad prawn farming is caused by the same things as bad chicken farming - the relentless downward pressure on prices forced on producers by supermarkets. So, there's a good reason to buy organic. And a good reason too, to ask your supermarket to ensure that more of the money you are spending on a tiger prawn goes back to Mr Huong and his colleagues. Pay him a bit better, and he could farm a bit better. It's that simple.</p> <h2>Prawn cocktail: the chemicals used in one Vietnamese prawn pond</h2> <p>Butaphosphan is a veterinary medicine to treat metabolic and developmental disorders.</p> <p>Methyl Hydroxybenzoate is an anti-fungal agent, also known as methylparaben.

  "<p>He likes a laugh, this Luiz Felipe Scolari. Be it introducing his personal press officer by recounting how the fellow Brazilian got lost in the woods that surround Scolari's Surrey residence last week, or teasing Sir Alex Ferguson by 'opening the door' for Cristiano Ronaldo to come and join him at Stamford Bridge. Even bad memories are sifted through for a wry aside. Scolari's abiding image of his sole competitive meeting with Ferguson, the 1999 Intercontinental Cup loss with Palmeiras? 'I remember he goes to receive the cup and I am not there.'</p> <p>Though only psychological silverware can be collected when they reacquaint themselves in the Premier League this afternoon, the meeting promises insight on the ultimate success of Scolari's Chelsea project. When that involves blending English physicality with a Latin technicality under the eye of a demanding owner, a sense of humour may prove useful. Yet the vision is compelling. Listening to Scolari talk about what local 'power and strength' could offer if combined with his Brazilian belief in the pre-eminence of possession you can see what Roman Abramovich was sold on when appointing his fourth manager in five years of ownership.</p> <p>'I think in England in a few years they play the same as Brazil,' Scolari says. 'English football is fantastic and they have very good players. You know, before in Europe just one national team played like Brazil. It was Yugoslavia. They played the same. Don't think only to shoot the ball up front, [you need to] touch the ball, work the ball. It's about possession. I spend 50 per cent of my training time on this every day. I don't want to put the ball 40 metres in front and lose it. I want the ball at my feet.'</p> <p>Hence the public reprimands that followed Chelsea's seemingly carefree 4-0 Champions League victory against Bordeaux in midweek. And the reason why Scolari spent most of the second half berating his players' regression into hurried attempts to move directly from defence to their opponents' goal. 'I wanted more possession, more touches, more control, more tranquillity,' Scolari explains. He regained it and his team's scoring ability on exchanging Joe Cole for a compatriot. 'When I put [Juliano] Belletti in, we controlled it more. You can see from the analysis: first half - 344 passes, second half - 258. In the first half we won 2-0.'</p> <p>Tuesday night's dressing room was the scene of a dressing down. 'The manager was disappointed,' John Terry said. 'He pulled me after the game and said at 2-0 we needed to keep the ball a lot more and make the other team do the running. The players have tried to show a bit of experience and taken our foot off the gas a bit to save ourselves for the weekend. That can be a good thing, but at times we were a bit sloppy. He's made it quite clear to us and we've got to take that into consideration.' When Friday's training session yielded the same errors, it was halted for further words of re-education.</p> <p>Five competitive matches and one frustrating transfer window into the job, Scolari has a better grasp of the confines within which he is working - the team's weaknesses increasing the higher he looks in his line-up. The defence is the best provisioned part of the squad with Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa settling well and Ricardo Carvalho a trusted deputy on the pitch and training ground. 'Different to the others that I have,' Scolari says, 'very fast and he smells where the ball is coming to.'</p> <p>A midfield that lost intricacy under Avram Grant is struggling to come to terms with Scolari's more thoughtful ways, particularly out wide. The unfortunate loss of Michael Essien to a cruciate knee injury eliminated the squad's most powerful player while leaving it short of options in the critical holding position. Tellingly, Scolari asked Michael Ballack (a particular favourite) if he could deputise there and initiated the signing of Mineiro, a Brazil international who specialises in the role.</p> <p>Attack, though, is the biggest headache. Didier Drogba's knees are still not strong enough to play 90 minutes and will have to be carefully managed. When Scolari talks about acting as Nicolas Anelka's psychologist he is less than half joking. Had Robinho not been lost to Manchester City for the want of \u00a34m, he would have been fundamental to the manager's plans.</p> <p>For Scolari, it all adds up to a period of at least partially arrested development and a need for January recruitment. He says: 'Maybe after three, four, five months and with one or two more players we will play as we played in China, or against Portsmouth. I have some players who aren't ready. I need to ask the fans to give me time. After that we'll be ready.'</p> <p>At least Chelsea have been winning games. Up in Manchester, questions are being asked about how long it will be before United begin to narrow a gap that could grow to nine points today. 'We just need our first win,' Ferguson says, apparently forgetting his side accounted for Portsmouth in the second game of the season. 'Well, our first real win. A win against opponents who will be around us at the end of the season. We don't want to be nine points behind Chelsea, we don't want to be nine points behind anyone, but it is not unthinkable. You have to give respect to Chelsea's tremendous unbeaten record at home. No one has won there in the league for 80-odd games, so we know what we have to do. On the other hand, all we have to do is win a football match and Manchester United are usually quite good at that.'</p> <p>Ferguson has Dimitar Berbatov fit again after injury and says Ronaldo will start his first game since ankle surgery in the summer. He has yet to work out whether he will ever be able to accommodate his four principal attacking players - Ronaldo, Berbatov, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez - in the same team. 'It's hard to know at the moment because Berbatov has only just arrived and we haven't had the chance to see who will link up with him best,' the Scot says. 'You never really know about partnerships until you try them. When we brought Dwight Yorke here, he formed an understanding with Andy Cole that we just hadn't anticipated. </p> <p>'[The forwards we have now] are not [out-and-out] strikers, and you can see a situation where three or even four of them might play together. But I do think they all have goals in them. Cristiano might not get 42 again this season, but I'm hoping Rooney and Tevez can reach 20 each, and Berbatov had an excellent record at Spurs. He should be good for 20 or more, too.'</p> <p>For now they have one goal between them and half leading scorer Darren Fletcher's total for the season. Scolari will adapt his defence to ensure United's frustrations continue and may well be content with a draw. 'When we start the game we start with a draw,' the Brazilian says. 'Maybe we finish like that and it's a fantastic result or maybe not. We have to see after the 90 minutes who is the best, who missed better chances. After this I say if it's a good result for me or not.' </p> <p>There will be a specially purchased bottle of wine over which to share that discussion with Ferguson, though not 'the best stuff from the south of Brazil' that Scolari promised The Observer on Friday. </p> <p>The laughs, he hopes, will be on the Scot.</p>",
  "<p>You have to hand it to the Americans. When they act, they act with a decisiveness and imagination that leaves the rest of us gaping. Friday's proposal to set up a US taxpayer-financed 'bad bank' that could assume up to $1 trillion of toxic debts from the US banking system is the best plan yet to unfreeze America's frozen credit markets, even if it risks letting the gothically greedy bankers who caused the crisis off the hook. The London Stock Market thought so. It finished a mad week with its biggest ever one-day rise.</p> <p>It was helped by the three-month ban on 'short-selling' - borrowing shares you don't own just to sell them, which had earlier in the week threatened to provoke Britain's second bank run as our top mortgage lender HBOS reeled from its impact. To save it, the British government had suspended its own competition rules and allowed the creation of a banking behemoth through a shotgun marriage with Lloyds TSB. Some bank shares jumped by 30 per cent on Friday. Governments, we have learned, not only have a responsibility to act. They can challenge the alleged unchallengeable - the right of markets to do just what they want. </p> <p>If that was one conclusion from last week, another is that Anglo-Saxon financial capitalism has suffered a fundamental reverse. New York and London had become the joint hub of a financial system that had deployed a new 'securitisation' technology - the capacity to turn any form of debt into a security to be freely bought, sold, hedged against and reinsured by the world's financial institutions - to allow borrowing to reach stunning levels. Thus everything from the huge private-equity deals funded by debt, like the destructive take-over of Boots, to our own home-made housing boom. The investment banks at the centre of this free-wheeling, securitisation-driven system - such as the now bankrupt Lehman Brothers or menaced Goldman Sachs - themselves used it to borrow an astonishing 30 times their capital to finance their deals. No more. Author Tom Wolfe once characterised them as the masters of the universe. Now they are either bust or so wounded that they are out of the game. The issue is: what next?</p> <p>For we are at a major juncture in our economic and political affairs. The American government may have had to act, but only because the new financial system had imploded. It had invented securitisation, used its financial and political clout in London and Washington to insist there was minimal regulation because free markets were allegedly always efficient, and then created mountainous levels of debt. The myth was that as long as any one bank could sell its securitised debt or insure it, all banks could do the same. But when the underlying assets against which the debt is collateralised fall in value or if there is concern about the viability of any key bank, the system could not handle banks selling all their securitised debt at once. When the US Treasury decided last weekend not to bail out Lehman Brothers, the entire financial system froze in panic. And without credit, as we know from America in the Thirties or Japan in the Nineties, there is a slump. Finance is far too important to be left to make its own rules.</p> <p>America's proposed 'bad bank' may clean out the Augean stables and relieve the panic in the US, but what next? For Britain, the City of London and our own domestic politicians, the conclusions from across the Atlantic are profound and uncomfortable. The brute reality is that the British mortgage finance market remains closed, property prices are slumping and our banks, while still standing, have been shocked into recession-inducing hyper-caution. Something has to change decisively if Britain is not to avoid a major recession. Look at the US. In order to stabilise the American mortgage market, like ours dependent on securitised loans (residential mortgage-backed securities), the US has had to fully nationalise its two mortgage banks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the US Treasury has promised to buy the securitised debt they issue to keep the mortgage market open. AIG, who insured securitised debt, is only still trading courtesy of a $85bn government loan. And now, on top, there is the 'bad bank'. All that just to stabilise the position. </p> <p>The number one issue is securitisation. It has landed the system in a mess because bankers, aided and abetted by right-wing think tanks and conservative politicians, said there was no need to regulate it. But there is no way forward without regulation. The emergent American position is clear. Securitisation should be thought of as a new technology like, say, aircraft once were. After a plane crash, we don't stop flying. The government does what is necessary by law, regulation and direct intervention to keep airlines in the air. Similarly with the new technology of securitisation. It enables the economy to sustain more debt. The choice is to condemn the new technology and force an economic crash as debt and credit regress to presecuritisation levels. Or it is to devise a system of public banks, government-supported insurance companies and a robust regulatory framework that allows the economy to enjoy the benefits.</p> <p>This lesson from America is still not learned in London. The sole concession is the Bank of England's temporary Special Liquidity Scheme, which allows banks to swap some securitised assets for cash. Hardly reported, the distressed banks have swopped more than \u00a3100bn, even though the terms are penal. But our official establishment carries on believing that there should be no role for the state in the financial markets because markets never make mistakes, and if they cannot handle a new technology like securitisation without public support or regulation, then the technology should be dropped. If a recession follows or house prices are halved, so be it.</p> <p>The Special Liquidity Scheme was reluctantly extended by a mere three months to January in the crisis of last week, after which a meaner substitute is to replace it. Anything more is fervently opposed by the Bank's governor, Mervyn King. Bankers must face the consequences of their actions, he thinks, even if everybody suffers. It is not an argument accepted by US Treasury Secretary Hank Poulson. It should not be accepted in Britain. Let's save the system, avoid a depression and make securitisation work for the public good - and deal with the culprits and fools later.</p> <p>Last week's events bought Britain a little time, but the policy debate remains vapid. David Cameron and George Osborne promote the myth that markets work best without public intervention. Lib Dem Treasury Spokesperson Vincent Cable, the best we have, resists American-style attempts to wrestle with securitisation as 'propping up house prices'. He doesn't get it either. Gordon Brown is trying to take credit for his part in saving HBOS and so save his political career. It would be more impressive if he and his government had pre-emptively put in place measures that would have kept HBOS independent - and begun reshaping the City to deal with securitisation. That means new public banks, new regulatory structures, new managed exchanges for securitised debt and public insurance of securitised assets - especially for the housing market. Britain remains on the edge of the precipice.</p> <p>The Americans have acted decisively in their system. We need to do the same in ours - and within weeks.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to Kingsholm, Mr Barkley. If England's occasional fly-half-cum-inside centre, Olly Barkley, joined Gloucester just to reboot his Test career, then the 26-year-old will have spent last night considering whether the move was worthwhile. Gloucester may have beaten the league's early pacesetters, handing Quins a first defeat, but their rollercoaster season continues. Having gifted their opponents two tries in the first 13 minutes, they merely kept the mistakes in reasonable check to squeeze home in the second half when Barkley opened his account for his new club.</p> <p>Barkley's last game at Kingsholm was in May when he helped Bath to win their first cup in a decade, beating Worcester in the final of the European Challenge Cup. After that he headed for New Zealand and another unhappy southern-hemisphere tour with England, collecting a fractured wrist on the way. </p> <p>Surgery delayed his Gloucester debut, but he had the comfort of playing alongside Mike Tindall, his centre partner for five years at Bath, and outside another Rec escapee, former Wales scrum-half Gareth Cooper. However it was another Bath old boy, Chris Malone, who inadvertently set up the attack that put Gloucester behind after 13 minutes. </p> <p>The Australian, keeping Nick Evans' berth warm at fly-half, hit the upright with a second attempted penalty, but when Danny Care recycled the ball Gloucester were caught flat-footed and Mike Brown had an easy job stepping through the sparse cover out wide.</p> <p>Easier still was Harlequins' second try three minutes later. Brown simply booted the ball upfield and, while Gloucester were looking for knock-on, Care, currently the man in possession of the England No 9 shirt, was left with an open route to the line. Had Malone managed to land either conversion - and two penalties - Gloucester would have been up against it. Instead they cut into the league leaders' 10-point advantage with a well worked try, as Luke Narraway broke from the base of a five-metre scrum to feed Tindall, whose raking pass left Olly Morgan room to canter in, but not close enough to the posts for Willie Walker to land the conversion.</p> <p>Either side of half-time the two kickers did at least manage to start finding the target - Walker wobbled a drop-kick over then landed his second penalty to put Gloucester ahead at 14-13 - but the game continued to be riddled with errors. First Rory Lawson, having replaced Cooper, caught Harlequins napping with a quick tap that Narraway developed into a runaway try for Alasdair Strokosch before Gloucester handed the points back. </p> <p>Lesley Vainikolo, recently an England player but now not even in the Saxons squad, made a mess of clearing up a kick which squirmed away from him into the path of Care and on to Malone. At 21-20 nerves were jangling, until Barkley stepped forward to add the final points.</p>",
  "<p>This is getting serious for Wasps. Outfought, outthought and outplayed, the English champions slumped to their third defeat of the season, their worst start to a campaign since the Courage Leagues began in 1987. And don't let the final scoreline have you believe it was a close game. Bruce Reihana missed with four of his five penalty attempts for Northampton, while Dave Walder, the Wasps stand-off, was successful with five of his six. The Saints, who outscored the champions by three tries to one, would not have been flattered by a 20-point margin of victory. </p> <p>But as much as Northampton deserved a success in which Carlos Spencer, the former All Black, and Ignacio Fernandez Lobbe, the Argentine lock, shone, so Wasps were a rudderless, disparate bunch who are missing the leadership qualities of Lawrence Dallaglio more than they could have imagined. They huffed and puffed, but their decision-making and execution were mediocre.</p> <p>They have also been slower than other clubs to grasp the nettle when it comes to the experimental law variations (ELVs). Tactical kicking looks as if it is becoming king and the attacking game that has served Wasps so well in recent years could soon become an endangered species. Spencer's tactical kicking game was excellent. Wasps, alas, looked to play more expansively than their opponents and their approach did not work. It also did not help their cause that Josh Lewsey handed Saints two tries on a silver platter, one in the first minute. But don't blame him alone. It was a collective failure. </p> <p>'We have some good people,' said Ian McGeechan, Wasps' director of rugby. 'Good people work together and we will continue to do that.' With regard to the ELVs, McGeechan added 'more rugby doesn't necessarily mean more wins. The kicking elements of the game have become critical. Do we play less rugby? That's the question we have to ask.' </p> <p>It was difficult not to feel a modicum of sympathy for Lewsey. After Reihana punted the ball 60 metres into Wasps' 22, he allowed it to bounce and then took an eternity over his clearance kick. Reihana charged him down and pounced on the loose ball to open the scoring. </p> <p>A shell-shocked Wasps, to their credit, responded strongly, with Walder and Tom Voyce combining to put Dominic Waldouck over to give them an 11-7 lead. But disaster struck for Wasps - and for Lewsey again, alas - when Spencer unleashed an up-and-under into Wasps' 22, Neil Best out-jumped Lewsey and Chris Ashton followed up to cross, unopposed, by the posts.</p> <p>With Dylan Hartley, the would-be England hooker, a ubiquitous force in the loose - and the quick-thinking Spencer pulling the strings from stand off - Saints dominated the first period. Furthermore, Hartley and his mates in the Northampton front row were causing their Wasps counterparts all manner of trouble in the tight scrum.</p> <p>After Pat Barnard replaced Tim Payne at the break, Wasps improved in the third quarter, when there were uncontested scrums after Hartley and Rob Webber were sent to the cooler for punching. It certainly didn't help the flow of a contest in which Chris White, the referee, also policed the breakdown with an iron fist. But that is what officials have been ordered to do this season. </p> <p>No matter. With Walder banging over two more penalties to Reihana's one, Wasps undeservedly led 20-17 until, with 12 minutes remaining, Stephen Myler, a replacement centre, found Sean Lamont on the left wing with a glorious long pass and the Scot barged his way over with the help of a few of his mates. </p> <p>Crucially, Myler was successful with the touchline conversion, which left Wasps almost certainly needing a touchdown if they were to claim their first victory of the season. And they didn't come remotely close.</p>",
  "<p>How appropriate that a game notable for missed kick after missed kick should have boiled down to, well, a missed kick. Eoghan Hickey lined up the conversion of Elvis Seveali'i's 77th-minute try with the hush of the stadium ringing in his ears. Irish had been 14 points behind after half an hour, but now all they needed was a conversion and the comeback would have been complete. </p> <p>Trouble was, Hickey was one of four goal kickers in the match who between them missed 11 kicks at goal. And this shot went the same way - it hovered teasingly over the right-hand upright, but despite the roars of the home crowd, the touch-judges could not be cajoled into raising their flags. </p> <p>In keeping with so unsatisfactory a match, it was not quite as simple as that anyway. Perhaps out of sheer frustration, Irish promptly conceded a penalty at the restart to give young Jack Cuthbert yet another shot at goal in the last minute. It said something that this 6ft 5in winger, barely 21, emerged by some distance as the most composed of the four kickers here. Brought in to insure against Butch James having as bad a day as he did last week in Bath's home defeat to Gloucester, he stepped up to the mark when it transpired that James was having just such another nightmare. </p> <p>James was central to the opening half-hour. As Bath burst on to the pitch, trying to work last week's anguish out of their system, James was pulling the strings as well as ever, but his first two shots at goal were woeful. Happily the second of those was the attempted conversion of his own try - and as it turned out, Bath's only touchdown - that came as early as the seventh minute. One of his many cut-out passes sent Joe Maddock deep into Irish territory, and after a few punishing drives James came onto Michael Claassens fizzing pass at an angle too lacerating for the Irish defence. </p> <p>It was the highlight of the first half and fitting reward for Bath, who dominated the opening exchanges. James, confident now, slotted his next two shots at goal, opening up an 11-0 lead, but missed his next one badly, hence Cuthbert's call, and the youngster landed two more before the break. Luckily for Bath, Irish were also struggling, not just with their kicking, but with the precision of practically every department of their game. In the first half, Peter Hewat and Hickey missed three penalties between them, although none as easy as James's misses. </p> <p>Alex Corbisiero, another youngster to be feted with praise, piled over for a try in the corner shortly before the break to get Irish's wagon rolling, albeit that Bath were down a man with Alex Crockett shown yellow for a swinging arm. Dave Pearson, the referee, had embarrassed himself when he reached for his yellow card, only to find it missing, so Crockett was shown nothing. And Pearson was off injured before the half was out. </p> <p>It was not a great day for the officials, or maybe it was, depending on whether you like the sound of their incessant whistling. The reason there could be so many missed attempts at goal is the sheer number of penalties awarded, and sure enough the experimental law variations (ELVs) saga was much discussed afterwards, or rather the accompanying strict protocol that has been issued to the referees. </p> <p>The whole ELV debate began life as an attempt to lessen the influence of the referee, but never has he been so empowered. Topsy Ojo injected some life into a deteriorating second half with a mazy counterattack that set London Irish on a threatening raid; but sure enough it came to nought as somebody was pinged just as it was getting interesting, for going off their feet or not releasing, or something. </p> <p>Almost all the attacks of any coherence that were mounted by either side foundered on the tedious sight of the referee's long arm. Toby Booth, London Irish's director of rugby, had no problem with either referee's consistency yesterday, but he begged for some semblance of sympathy from them. The spirit and not the letter of the law is all anyone really wants. </p> <p>All the same, the second half, and the final quarter in particular, were London Irish's. It had looked as if Seveali'i's chip and chase for Irish's second try had proved just enough, if only he could have concentrated less on celebrating and more on getting the ball closer to the posts. He should have known that his kicker would need all the help he could get.</p>",
  "<p>After showing signs of an unlikely metamorphosis into the United States' version of Colin Montgomerie, Phil Mickelson settled back into something closer to his normal Ryder Cup routine yesterday. The wheels came off the great left-hander's partnership with Anthony Kim during the morning foursomes, the pair proving themselves unable to reproduce the sparkling performance of the opening day. Teamed with Hunter Mahan in the afternoon, Mickelson pulled himself together but still ended the day resembling Monty, Europe's absent hero, in nothing more than his generous embonpoint and creamy golf swing.</p> <p>The enforced dissolution of the partnership between the 38-year-old Mickelson and the 23-year-old Kim came as a disappointment to their captain. It was early in the summer that Mickelson called Paul Azinger and put in a request to be paired with his fellow Californian. With two tour wins to his credit this season along with more than $4m in winnings, the 23-year-old Kim is many people's candidate to be the new generation's leading challenger to Tiger Woods, whom Mickelson partnered so disastrously during the 2004 tournament at the suggestion of Hal Sutton.</p> <p>This is Mickelson's seventh Ryder Cup, but he came into it with the miserable record of one and a half points from the two most recent editions and Azinger seemed to be taking a chance on Friday when he sent out the three-time major winner as his point man, with a rookie alongside him. But the Americans fought back from three down to halve their match against Padraig Harrington and Robert Karlsson, earning credit from Jim Furyk for getting the whole opening-day US revival under way. 'They turned the momentum,' Furyk said. 'They kind of led the team out there.' They did even better again in the afternoon four-ball against Harrington and Graeme McDowell, coming back from a similar deficit to win the match and generate the first sparks that would turn into a late-afternoon wildfire of enthusiasm around the course.</p> <p>'It was a fun day for us,' Mickelson said later. 'After being three down in both matches, we played with a lot of heart and emotion. I love playing with this guy. He has a lot of talent, a lot of game. It was fun for me to get that youthful exuberance today. It's infectious.'</p> <p>The contagion seemed to have lasted overnight, to judge from the way Mickelson and Kim set off in their opening foursome yesterday morning. Confronting Henrik Stenson, in his second Ryder Cup, and Oliver Wilson, hitting his first ball in the competition, they were four up after six holes and were bestowing wide smiles and high-fives upon their supporters as they passed between the galleries on their way from green to tee.</p> <p>But then came an unexpected reversal of the previous day's shifts of momentum. Required to hit a blind second shot over a huge bank at the doglegged 500-yard 6th hole, Wilson produced a marvellously clean strike to leave the ball just short of the green. The hole could not be saved, but the brio of the recovery gave them fresh heart. And, as it happened, Mickelson and Kim were about to loosen their own wheel nuts. Mickelson's sliced drive over the gallery at the long 7th left Kim to play the ball off a patch of cracked asphalt, a task he accomplished with ease, as if it were a lark. Mickelson's next shot cannoned away off a stone wall, forfeiting the hole.</p> <p>Kim's tee shot found a greenside bunker in the short eighth, further cutting their lead. Two holes later the younger man again landed in a trap and Mickelson's sand shot, from a reasonable lie, flew across the fairway and into the trees to leave them only one up. A bogey five at the 12th was enough to level the match.</p> <p>The increasingly erratic Mickelson's drive at the 15th landed in the trees, from where Kim launched a showy attempt to bend it into the green. Instead the ball hit a tree, bounced off a steward and plopped into the creek. Their opponents' crushing answer was a nerveless birdie that gave the Europeans the lead.</p> <p>With Mickelson trying to reimpose some degree of control over his wayward game and Kim furiously trying to hit his way out of trouble, neither man appeared capable of taking the responsibility for restoring a degree of steadiness to the partnership. Facing a 20-footer on the penultimate green to keep them in the match, Mickelson could not deliver. A partnership that had looked like Azinger's trump card now lay in ruins. </p> <p>Both Americans deserved to be benched, but Mickelson was sent back out alongside the 26-year-old Mahan, another Californian, for an afternoon rehab session. The plan seemed to have worked when his birdies at the 2nd and 3rd holes clawed back an advantage immediately established by the Swedish pair of Stenson and Robert Karlsson and gave the Americans a lead they increased through Mickelson's eagle at the par-five 7th, before of a wonderful run of Karlsson birdies pinned them back and opened the way for the Europeans to share a point.</p>",
  "<p>Lloyd Halifax sounds disconcertingly like some character actor from the 1950s, specialising in smooth corporate types, heartbreakers, raiders, even 'spivs and speculators'. Imagine him starring in a tense thriller vehicle called The Black Horse, in which a carpetbagging businessman takes over a venerable but dilapidated house, modernises it and sacks all the loyal old retainers. You can almost hear the hisses already.</p> <p>The news that Scotland's oldest banking institution, the Bank of Scotland, and its partner Halifax, have been taken over by Lloyds is black indeed. Even though the hoof beats have been thudding closer for some time, it's rare that a takeover in the financial sector should provoke such a strong, emotional public reaction. Given how rarely any of us set foot inside a bank any more, even to organise a mortgage, why should the demise of HBOS resonate so powerfully?</p> <p>In purely financial terms, the absorption of HBOS may be a good thing, stabilising a tottering institution and setting it on a firmer base. On this occasion, though, symbolism and history outweigh fiscal certainty and loom larger than the potential - or perhaps certain - loss of jobs.</p> <p>It's often said that Scotland's civil society rests on the Kirk, Scots law and a once distinctive educational system. Curiously, the model promulgated by such scholars as David Daiches, rarely mentions our independent banking sector, an example of how often the humanities prefer to ignore the 'dismal science' of economics. The Bank of Scotland has been around since 1695, founded by an Act of the old Scottish Parliament and capitalised with the equivalent of \u00a38m in today's terms. This places its origins at a cusp in Scottish history, with economic rivalry across the border already acute, and Union looming.</p> <p>The collapse of the Company of Scotland in the ill-fated Darien Scheme (conceived in an overt attempt to emulate English trade successes, east and west) occurred at around the same time, marked the nation and ushered in Union. Almost no one in Scotland was left unaffected.</p> <p>The HBOS takeover fits a ready-made space in nationalist thinking. It matters little where the bank's actual seat of power has been since the merger with the Halifax, or indeed that most bank customers rarely, if ever, actually visit a branch any more. What matters here is the perception that a Scottish institution has been taken by an English one and in the process has lost or will lose the right to issue banknotes.</p> <p>It has become a cliche frequently adduced in speeches at transatlantic weddings, that while Americans know who's on which denomination of banknote, we Scots haven't a clue whether Sir Isaac Newton is worth 20 quid or five, and who Mary Slessor is and why there are all those strange African place names on a tenner. To be sure, the situation is complicated in Britain by the existence of different note-issuing banks, but it turns out we're not as indifferent to their provenance as all that. Though no nationalist, nothing boils my blood faster than having a Scottish note peered at and declined in London. In an instant, I turn from Gordon Brown to Wendy Wood.</p> <p>It may be that all is not yet lost. It took an act of Parliament to establish the Bank of Scotland, and it may take another to disestablish it or transfer its assets, so perhaps there are political and legal fixes still available to HBOS that might preserve the marque. In the meantime, though, we should take the opportunity to remember that although even the early days of Scottish banking weren't innocent of Mr Salmond's 'spivs and speculators', it has been the banks, and not just courts, Kirk and schools, that for the last three centuries have encouraged, defended and perpetuated much that is distinctive, enlightened and, yes, noble in Scottish life and arts.</p> <p>The Tonight Show once ran a spoof infomercial in which a group of very plausible bank staff described their services: 'You have a dollar and want dimes? We can do that! Or maybe you've got a 20, and you want three fives and some change? Hey, that's what we do!' The funny part was how long it took most viewers to understand it was a spoof. There's a consensus that banks do nothing but move money around and charge us for the privilege.</p> <p>All those mysterious deductions on the monthly statement tend to reinforce that view, but for all their apparent and actual dislocation - ATMs, distant call centres, telephone and online banking - the banks are powerful agencies of social evolution, contributing vastly more to creative life, sport and education than several National Lottery Funds laid end to end.</p> <p>Bank branding at, say, a rugby game is of a very different nature to sponsorship by a brewing, car or, in the good old days, tobacco company, for the simple reason that no product is involved and the 'service' is a unique compact, an undertaking to look after your money, hand it over when you want it, and, as often as not, allow you to spend more of it than you actually have. </p> <p>The Bank of Scotland's headquarters building is as an integral part of the Edinburgh skyline as the castle (where the bank's assets were strongboxed when the Jacobite army arrived). By the same token, the bank is a living history lesson. It tells us where we came from, how and why we became attached to our southern neighbour, and to a degree how we managed to effect a partial separation again. Above all, how we have been able to enjoy a rich artistic, dramatic, music and literary culture.</p> <p>For three centuries, perverse though it may seem, we have been accorded the privilege of a rich cultural overdraft. It is not surprising there is a sense of mourning this weekend.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What he watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>Tess Of The D'urbervilles</strong> BBC1</p> <p><strong>The Family</strong> C4</p> <p><strong>Massive</strong> BBC3</p> <p><strong>Dispatches: What's In Your Wine?</strong> C4</p> <p>It was the week the banks screamed like Bacon's Popes, and writhed, and died, their teased confected castles of lies imploding with the snap and caramel spangle of spun sugar, and thus a grand one in which to wonder about money itself, and whether the stuff really makes us happy.</p> <p>Tess Durbeyfield didn't have any. She had, instead, in mother Joan (Ruth Jones), someone who, most disconcertingly, looked the epitome of apple-cheeked Brueghel peasant mumsiness - you would, if a child, just want to lose yourself in her milky russet folds - while meantime orchestrating the future of her daughter's maidenhood with a rough grasping cynicism which would shame the pimps on a Shanghai wharf (or a short-selling City trader).</p> <p>In Hardy's Wessex, however, as in anyone's anywhere, anytime, it was enough to have looks, and Gemma Arterton's Tess had them in more layers than her petticoat; more than enough, certainly, to please her sly mother, who sent her off by virtue of the dubious family connection to work her way into the d'Urberville money.</p> <p>Enter - and my but he did, the bastard - Alec d'Urberville, played with great floppy sneers and just the right amount of ham by Hans Matheson. To save time for those who haven't read the book, Matheson tells you within five seconds of his preening, lecherous, waistcoated first swagger around Tess, that he is a Bad 'Un. To dispel lingering doubts, the randy privileged young cockpocket is then shown being awful to his mum (Anna Massey, acting wonderfully but looking as if she herself had died at around the time of Hotel du Lac, which if true would make it great acting): a proud, forlorn, haunted cobweb of a woman, surrounded uselessly by riches and finches, hating her son.</p> <p>Much of this was wonderful. It lacks, so far, the bubbling, spirited humour of Cranford, but it is also less insipid than so much Austen. There are great dusks, great Wessex dusks; and dances above clifftops where the sun and sea and wind tug you into the screen: and then the light leaches from the picture, the light seems to leach from life itself, and suddenly we are in the shuddering midst of fog-bound rape.</p> <p>Arterton was more than pleasing: terribly subtle often, never more so than with the tiny stiffenings when she knows her shame is itself known, and she is excluded from the rest of the servants. If quibbles there were, it was that, even with allowances for her character's natural bearing, the camera was terribly kind. There were times, watching Tess, with her teeth and poise and just-so sweep of perfect borrowed gown, among hoi snaggle-toothed polloi, when it was sniggeringly reminiscent of that bit with the mud-farmers in Monty Python's Grail: 'How do you know he's the King?' 'Cos he's the only one not covered in shit.' But this works, often darkly beautifully; and, most importantly, it tells us that it's autumn again, with fine ways to save much money and look at many horses on lengthening Sunday nights.</p> <p>Money. Now we've all got it, enough of it at least to not whore out our daughters just to buy a new horse and some more mud, but is it making us any happier today than it did poor rich finchy Madam D'Urberville? The Hughes family of Canterbury had it: or at least enough for everyone to have mobile phones, and food (lashings of it, served up by the absurdly biddable father, Simon - he actually offers them all choices of European cuisines, like a menu; do all modern parents do this? In my and I'm sure in Tess's day the only choice offered was eating indoors or outside, with the pigs) on the table, and to get endless taxis to clubs to annoy the parents.</p> <p><strong>The Family</strong> is meant to be Channel 4's attempt to make up for its reptilian part in the tumescent rise of reality TV by going back to the genre's allegedly golden, innocent, roots: taking a 'normal' family rather than huckstering sex-change lab-rats and filming them for 100 days. It says much for our generalised acceptance of the genre that the Hugheses, a normal enough family, are so easily comfortable with a record number of cameras on them; mainly on Simon and wife Jane and clubbing teen Emily.</p> <p>The results are, intermittently, intriguing. The perfect encapsulation, mainly, of the point-missing of so many parent-child arguments. Beckett, Pinter, Ionesco: no piece of fiction, still, has better caught the stilted waste of the act of repetitive argument than life manages itself, when you can listen.</p> <p>'I'm not trying to screw things up.'</p> <p>'Yes you are. And why are you going out again?'</p> <p>'Because I want to.'</p> <p>'Because you want to.'</p> <p>Mother Jane interrupts daddy Simon - he's a daddy, not a father - at one point with a raised hand, to make a slightly better point to her recalcitrant daughter, and one of the billion cameras catches him taking the childish huff with her for that. He tries again, but -</p> <p>'I've heard mum. I've listened, heard it, twice, you don't need to repeat it.'</p> <p>'Yes I do.'</p> <p>There is much epic point-missing going on. It's like watching a game of tennis between Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder. Whether it will hold the attention for the full series is the killer. Already, Emily is being portrayed by some parts of the press as some kind of devil-child. She's not. She's a teenager, living a little too long at home. There were winning hugs, scenes, dancings, between her and mother Jane, herself part of the problem, wincing with childish pouts over the last steps on the stony track to 40.</p> <p>The series credits two 'Hot Head operators', which we will assume is some new kind of mini-camera but looked for a second as if someone had thought cynically of creating a jobshare just to ratchet up the tantrum count. Oh, we'll get them, more of them, as this trundles on: but, I suspect, nothing like the showdowns in the more manufactured 'reality' shows of the last few years. Whether we have now lowered the bar so low that viewers will switch off without helpings of misogyny, racism, hatred and chemical dysfunction is the question: if so it'll be a shame, for this is an admirable project in that it does, fairly honestly, as did the original Family in 1974, tell us things about the way we live today, if only that in many households the parents are now younger than the children. </p> <p>Danny and Shay, the likeable scallies, came into some money in the opener of <strong>Massive</strong>, and promptly started their own record label. Cue a succession of auditions: the loopy, the hidden diamond, the of course hopeless. It's a winning device, done in everything from The Commitments to Shallow Grave, which rather begs the question: why do it again, without even the big budget? But the whole thing actually grows on you, and scampers about perfectly for young things waiting on a Saturday night to go out (as we'd learnt from Emily, above, they don't go out now till 11. When did that start happening?) and there are plenty of I'm sure brilliant musical jokes which it's probably my fault for not enjoying more by virtue of being a) 83 years old and b) not from Manchester.</p> <p>Most pointless eight hours of the week - the programme may have been shorter than that by a couple of minutes but it didn't feel like it - was the insultingly so-what Dispatches purporting to shock by telling you <strong>What's In Your Wine</strong>. It opened with a later much-featured shot of a razor blade on a blob of earth on a vineyard in Champagne, and the hectoring tones of Jane Moore, who failed quite laughingly to convince us to have something more to be worried about.</p> <p>This pretended that we needed more labelling telling us precisely what mix of grape juice, water, sugar and tannins are in our plonk. Sure, some wines are a touch diddled about with along the way, but it's nothing compared to the confected outrage which shoutingly underpinned this dreary piece of finger-wagging. It turned out (doubtless to the crew's disappointment) that the number of people killed every year by additives in wine totals none. Count them: none. Number of people killed by alcohol: oh, quite a lot more than none. It's the alcohol, that's the problem with wine, and we've always known there are tannins and the like because they give us hangovers. I still don't know why to be worried about the razor blade. Did it somehow sneak into a grape? Do you think, Jane, that people who drink champagne wouldn't notice if they were suddenly cutting their tongue open? </p> <p>Just what we needed this week, something to tell us we were all stupid, couldn't trust anyone (even to help us drown our sorrows) and were being conned out of our money. Sometimes, of course, the more money we have the more it simply gives us to worry about. Maybe it was all better before we metaphorically left Tess's hovel, when all we needed for happiness was a horse, a beach, and mud, and dancing, and no sharp noses asking what's in your mead. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kathryn Flett is away</p> <h2>Meet the new boss: A star is born</h2> <p>Main surprise with the just-returned <strong>Question Time</strong>, other than that someone (the Gothically unforgiving Ian Hislop) could actually make you feel sorry for Harriet Harman*, was the star-is-born moment when you realise you're watching someone who should be fronting his own programme.</p> <p>Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, revealed himself to be far more than trendy hair and specs. A wise, impassioned young puppy and a positive force for good, he spoke, with knowledge and eloquence, about the 'culture of bossiness', the 'absurd regulation' of every slice of life in Britain today.** The cheering reaction showed how many nerves he was touching. When they do a series on stupid laws (maybe \u00e0 la Dragon's Den, with the law-maker hauled in to explain), they already have their Duncan Bannatyne. </p> <p>* almost</p> <p>** other than, of course, the banks</p>",
  "<p>It was Arthur Koestler, writing during the Second World War, after the existence of the camps became known, who first pointed out that there are limits to the human rights project. Those who described what was going on in places such as Auschwitz-Birkenau were obliged, Koestler lamented, to become 'Screamers'. The Screamers did succeed in reaching listeners, but only momentarily. 'You can convince them for an hour,' Koestler said, 'and their mental half-defence begins to work, and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned.'</p> <p>For every brutally honest Koestler, however, there have always been others prepared to believe that humans are either basically good or susceptible to persuasion when it comes to saving the world. Frumpy, usually dressed in black, reviled by conservatives as much as she was revered by her progressive followers, Franklin Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor, was in 1948 the most famous woman in American public life. In her weekly radio shows she offered listeners an unceasing flow of upbeat liberal homilies. It was she who presented the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the General Assembly on a winter's day in 1948, in Paris. It's hard not to sense that this was a historic moment. She stresses that the document is not 'a statement of law and legal obligation'; but that it may well become 'the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere'. Most poignant is Eleanor's assertion that human rights are based on what she calls 'a spiritual fact'. Man must have freedom to develop his full stature, she states, 'and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity'.</p> <p>The declaration was one of a number of documents adopted by the newly created UN as part of the postwar effort to save humanity from further bloodshed. It is emphatically a document of its time, making no mention of many things that liberals would now regard as their inalienable rights - to express one's own sexuality by choosing partners of either sex in perfect freedom - and of course no mention of the death penalty and abortion.</p> <p>Much of the declaration reeks of the collectivist, welfarist consensus of the late 1940s. David Cameron and contemporary conservatives would find nothing to object to in its evocation of its importance of the family as the cornerstone of civilisation. Truly striking, however, are the guarantees of free speech, freedom to migrate (as crucial a right for refugees in the 1940s as it is for the world's migrants today), and the basic kit of political freedom that comprises what democrats value in the contemporary world. 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers' (Article 19). No one could have put it better, even after all these years of attempts to implement these principles.</p> <p>I wonder what Eleanor would make of our world. She would be astonished by the proliferation of treaties and declarations designed to further the cause, and she would certainly be encouraged by the arrival of a new international style of public life. No non-governmental organisations (NGOs) existed in her lifetime, and we can imagine her as a member of Amnesty or Human Rights Watch. But she might be shocked to discover that the undertakings made in the wake of the mid-century catastrophe hadn't borne much fruit. The killing fields are still open, though they may be more carefully hidden and on a smaller scale. What the poet Robert Lowell called 'the blind swipe of the pruner and his knife' still disturbs the Sabbath rest.</p> <p>In 1948 the Russians sent Andrei Vyshinsky, the judge who had presided over Stalin's show trials, to the UN. He declined to sign the Declaration, referring to it as 'just a collection of pious phrases.' In post-Communist Russia, journalists are killed with impunity. It is still possible to fight wars in the name of peace or human rights - on behalf of the beleaguered South Ossetians - but no one must pretend that this is the real reason for the conflict. Perhaps hypocrisy is on the wane. </p> <p>Meanwhile China has inscribed a commitment to human rights in its constitution. During the Olympics, acting under international pressure, the Chinese created a site in which its citizens might be given official permission to hold demonstrations. Two 70-year-old women wishing to protest that their flat had been torn down were given a year of 're-educative labour', though the sentence was suspended pending their good behaviour. I suppose this is a step forward from the Cultural Revolution in which more than a million Chinese were beaten up, tortured and killed in what historians now see as a bout of state-sponsored anarchy.</p> <p>But what of the Western idea of 'humanitarian intervention' - pioneered in Kosovo and repeated, with less conspicuous success, in Iraq. War was fought in the 1940s in order to save humanity, not to dispose of unwanted minor tyrants. Is it possible to impose democracy when the means involve violating human rights? Nothing in the traditional lexicon of human rights gives any guidance in such matters. </p> <p>As the neocons tell us, parts of the world appear bent on perfecting authoritarian systems. Because of their beliefs, Islamists can have no regard for secular rights. Just as worrying is the assertion (invariably made by those who wish to dispense with them, finding expression in many deeply shocking documents churned out by the UN) that human rights belong to the West, either a rich man's toy or a legacy of imperialists. </p> <p>My own worries are somewhat different. Human rights may simply be a last, ineffectual expression of Samaritanism in a post-Christian world in which suffering is commemorated but no one ever meets the victims. Trying to impose standards by means of pieces of paper which express high humanitarian aims may be what we do when we no longer have the power or the will to engage with the messiness of real politics. Put another way, human rights may merely be a way of appearing to save the world for those who don't want to try too hard to do so. </p> <p>Not long ago, I attended the annual Amnesty human-rights media awards. I've spent much of my career producing films in which atrocities are documented, but I was shocked by the procession of horrors. As one atrocious, unspeakable act after another was brought to light by means of images projected above our heads, it became hard to recall the many courageous journalists, film-makers and activists whose work was being celebrated. Articles about female foeticide were honoured, and there were films (I had indeed been involved with them) about Darfur and the dungeons of George Bush. Index on Censorship was awarded a prize for its expos\u00e9 of the murders of Russian journalists, crimes unpunished and greeted with indifference by the Russian elite. The most touching moment was the award in absentia of a prize to Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani, a Yemeni journalist jailed for 'insulting the President'. It seemed only appropriate that the prize should be given by the BBC's Alan Johnston, fresh from his own imprisonment in Gaza. </p> <p>Chardonnay is served on such occasions, and a glass was in my hand when I encountered a journalist friend from the BBC. He appeared chastened, anxious, and his thoughts mirrored mine. 'So much care goes into the making of these films, the writing of these articles. And people risk their lives,' he said. 'But does anyone actually watch them? Does anyone care?' </p> <p>For the past months, I've tried to answer this question, navigating my way around activists and theorists. I've found many eloquent defenders of human rights. But I notice, too, an impatience with the subject among those whom I interview. 'Yes we know that rights are important,' they wish to say, 'but do we always have to talk about them in a hand-wringing way? Can't we find better news about rights?' And I notice, too, a weary anger when it becomes apparent to both of us that, alas, the news will never be very good. Still, human rights can be exciting. Sir Geoffrey Nice, the man who spent four years of his life trying Slobodan Milosevic, carries the trial around on his laptop. Here is another intelligent human being with whom I can jointly define the nature of contemporary atrocity.</p> <p>But I meet optimists, too. The lawyer and author Geoffrey Robertson speaks out against obscurantists in his book Crimes Against Humanity with the eloquence and gusto of a north London Voltaire. 'There is much more awareness of human rights and we have made a start in enforcing them,' he tells me. In between visits to the Hague, where he's selecting judges for the UN tribunal, he outlines his pet project - a Convention Against Tyranny capable of giving legal justification in order to overthrow evildoers. </p> <p>'At present it would be confined to situations where genocide or widespread murder and torture are being inflicted by state agencies,' he says. 'But there are other forms of barbarism: the Taliban's denial of education to women and girls and execution of homosexuals. Mugabe's destruction of democracy and use of starvation and thuggery as political weapons. That is for the future.'</p> <p>If not beady-eyed, the redoubtable Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty, turns out to be nearly as positive. 'You have to think of the Europe of 1938,' she says. 'The biggest European country was ruled by a government that persecuted minorities, arranging \"disappearances\". That would be unthinkable now.' Khan points to all the treaties signed in the past 60 years. 'We don't need any more declarations about rights,' she says. 'The problem is implementation.' She describes to me a world in which a civil society involving millions globally is campaigning on behalf of rights only to find themselves frustrated by politicians. I tell her that I am only partly convinced by this. Politicians are conservative people, but there must be a reason why they are so reluctant to make a stand. </p> <p>We are all agreed, however, when it comes to evoking the damage wrought to the cause of human rights by the so-called war against terror. In the name of national security, America, viewed in 1945 as the sole beacon of a world in darkness, has attempted to re-establish torture as a legitimate method of interrogation, practising it on a substantial scale. Dozens of books chronicle the ineptitude with which the Bush administration stumbled into Iraq. The best is Jane Mayer's The Dark Side, a bestseller in the US. It has yet to find a publisher here. Dip into any chapter and you will find out about 'interrogation' in the new century:</p> <p><strong>'11:15</strong>: Told detainee dog is held in higher esteem... Began to teach detainee lessons such as stay, come and bark...</p> <p><strong>13:00</strong>: Dog tricks continue... Interrogator showed photos of 9-11 victims and told him he should bark happy for these people. Interrogator showed photos of al-Qaeda terrorist and told detainee he should growl at these people. A towel was placed on detainee's head like a burka, and interrogator proceeded to give detainee dance lessons.' </p> <p>The most convincing explanation for the Bush debacle comes from a former top Bush administration lawyer who Mayer quotes. The lawyer, Philip Zelikow, tells her, 'Fear and anxiety were exploited by zealots and fools.' Americans were ready to go along with torture as long as it was called something else. So the lawyers who betrayed America were responding to something more than a public mood. But can we really suppose that these emotions are uniquely American, and that any country, confronted with what is perceived as a threat to its security, won't go the same way? Why should the dark side not prove a common destination in the new century? 'American ideals are undercut by torture. It makes nonsense of our constitutional protections and our claims that all humans have inalienable rights under the law,' Mayer says. 'It hurts the rest of the world, too - because when America forsakes its role as a defender of human rights, it gives licence to tyrannies everywhere.'</p> <p>British governments, too, have been swayed by fear and anxiety. As junior allies we're complicit in what the law lord Johan Steyn called 'the legal black hole of Guant\u00e1namo.' As Conor Gearty, professor of law at the London School of Economics, points out, Anglo-American linkage of human rights and the war against terror has tried to turn them 'into a basis for selective aggression abroad and an alibi for brutality at home'.</p> <p>Another optimist (and international lawyer), Philippe Sands, urges me to take a long view of human rights. He says that rights are the only riposte to the notion, enshrined in European law for centuries, that the state and its representatives have unlimited powers. We should not expect that doctrines adhered to for so long can be overthrown in a year or a decade. Sands was involved in the Pinochet case. He sees the detention of the Chilean dictator as the moment when it was established that for 'crimes against humanity' there should be no frontiers. The law lords did decide that the dictator had a case to answer - not in the country in which the crimes were committed, but where the prosecution was initiated. Home Secretary Jack Straw did return Pinochet to Chile, but the decision was made on health grounds.</p> <p>And yet superpowers do still act to protect themselves, invoking sovereignty. America posed throughout the Cold War as the world's defender of freedoms - but things were different when US citizens might conceivably find themselves prosecuted under international law. Like the Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on Genocide was signed in 1948, after a long, single-handed campaign by Rafael Lemkin, a Polish refugee settled in New York. However, the US Senate declined to ratify the document. Each day the Senate was in session, for 19 years, Senator William Proxmire got to his feet and made a four-minute speech condemning genocide. But it took the charm of Ronald Reagan (and presumably the death of most of the remaining concentration-camp guards in exile somewhere in America) to persuade senators to overcome their objections.</p> <p>As Samantha Power shows in her history of genocide, A Problem from Hell, America proved to be reluctant when it came to preventing genocide. Invariably, it was decided that vital interests were not at stake in the poor, remote countries where killings took place. Officials could then say that it was too late to do anything. Afterwards came the moment to say that it should never happen again. This is what happened in Bosnia, and, most horrifyingly, in Rwanda. With Obama or McCain President, the camps in Guant\u00e1namo will finally be emptied and closed down. But can we expect to see American troops freely used to prevent genocide in places like Darfur? I somehow don't think so.</p> <p>The most important NGO active in human rights remains Amnesty International. It was launched in the pages of this newspaper in 1961 by a London lawyer and a group of fellow liberals. 'The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence,' Peter Benenson began. Amnesty would seek to adopt individual 'prisoners of conscience', writing letters to the governments which had incarcerated them or encouraging others to do so. </p> <p>Amnesty's aims were carefully limited, and the prisoners adopted came from the West as well as the Communist bloc and the developing world. (Those who advocated violence were not selected, and Amnesty felt ambivalent about Nelson Mandela, first adopting and then rejecting him when he was found guilty of sabotage, although they did acknowledge that people like him might 'feel or find themselves forced into a position in which the only road to freedom is violence...'). Soon letters poured in from a new breed of human-rights activist. Numberless teenagers (myself included) formed Amnesty cells at school. The approach of carefully selecting prisoners, restricting Amnesty's aims, appeared satisfactory.</p> <p>But times changed, and during the 1970s it became possible for Western governments to raise human-rights questions with their Soviet bloc counterparts. In consequence human rights were no longer the sole property of NGOs. As the scope of campaigning increased, those who practised it became more aggressive. In danger of being overtaken by its rivals, Amnesty did move with the times. But it was not until 2003, under Khan's stewardship, that its charter was substantially revised. Amnesty now runs campaigns in relation to the fullest range of 'economic and social rights'. Khan is proud of the recent Stop Violence Against Women in which rape, honour killings, domestic violence and clitoridectomy were targeted.</p> <p>Traditionalists criticised the changes, suggesting that this would make Amnesty indistinguishable from other liberal NGOs. They were upset by the professionalisation of what appeared to be an institution set in its ways. Spread over many floors and located to the east of the city in Shoreditch, as clean-lined as a newly completed city academy, the new Amnesty headquarters is a daunting place, with activists beavering away on each floor. It's hard not to be impressed by so much seriousness. But I find myself surprised, too, by the jolliness of so many working there. Can they really spend each day trying to nudge the immobile Home Office into treating asylum seekers just a little better? Can they remain motivated over the long slog required to get the UN to create some sort of document aimed at limiting the social ravages caused globally by the arms trade? It would appear that somehow they do, though I realise that I would find such diligence testing. </p> <p>However, it's hard here to evade the central contradiction of Amnesty, which is that of the human-rights movement itself. Amnesty still exists by placing in the public eye what, in perfect earnestness, it aims to put an end to. As an institution Amnesty is dedicated to unceasing, endless struggle. I ask a researcher whether the work doesn't get to her. 'Sometimes it does,' says simply. 'But there are compensations.'</p> <p>I can find an echo of such feelings in my own experience. My way into the human-rights maze came via a trap door labelled Srebrenica. A Cry From the Grave is a film which gives an exhaustive, minute-by-minute account of the massacre of more than 7,000 Muslim men and boys in 1995. The director, Leslie Woodhead, says, 'Like the crimes committed, it won't go away. You can see a version of it now in the town's museum, where the massacre is commemorated.' </p> <p>Geoffrey Nice was the prosecutor in the four-year trial of Slobodan Milosevic at the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague, and I ask him what he now thinks of the experience. Did he feel cheated when Milosevic died before the proceedings were completed? Lanky, hyperarticulate, Nice is frank and uncomplicated when it comes to admitting that the system is far from perfect. 'It would have been good to secure a conviction, and obviously I wanted one,' he says. 'But the record stands. Anyone who wants to re-establish the reputation of Milosevic will have to contend with what we found out.' But Nice proves to have complex views about prosecuting war criminals. He senses that it is time to abandon the all-out model of Nuremberg, in which a verdict is also a political statement of sorts. We should come to regard international courts as normal, uncontroversial. If it isn't always possible to secure convictions (or indeed to try people, because political considerations make that impossible), maybe we shouldn't worry too much.</p> <p>Only a few years ago Henry Kissinger was shocked when he was presented, via the manager of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, with a legal document asking for his help in sorting out aspects of the Pinochet-era killings in Chile. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in a German court to indict Donald Rumsfeld. I don't think Rumsfeld, or indeed George W Bush, have anything to worry about, even if they do take their holidays in Europe. But in The Hague a few weeks ago, you could choose to see a freshly shaved, suited ex-New Age guru and former Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska Radovan Karadzic appear in court, declining to enter a plea, or watch Charles Taylor, the ex-President of Liberia, fumble with his papers as he watched another witness give an account of his role in the horrifying 10-year civil war. The courtrooms are heavily protected with giant, aquarium-like windows. They're unpicturesquely located in buildings that resemble the headquarters of waste-disposal companies. However, in their anonymity, they are deeply moving places, expressing a determination that impunity should be punished.</p> <p>Many years in the creation, the new International Criminal Court (ICC) was backed by Clinton and melodramatically 'unsigned' by George Bush. Bizarre regulations restrict those who can be tried there to citizens of signatory countries, or cases approved by the UN Security Council. (This means that no Russian, Chinese or American war criminal will ever be brought before the court; indeed the court has been criticised for targeting exclusively offenders from Africa, thus appearing the instrument of neo-imperialism.) But Nice hopes that the US may one day change its mind. 'The real problem with international law is how hard it is to keep independent of politics,' he says. 'Imagine you are running the court, choosing which cases to prosecute. There are war crimes committed everywhere. How do you know which ones to choose? It doesn't mean that you mustn't choose, but it's difficult.'</p> <p>In Albert Camus's short, stinging monologue The Fall (1956), Jean-Baptiste Clamence, a seedy, drunk lawyer, buttonholes a reluctant listener in an Amsterdam bar. On first reading, the book appears to be a perfect-pitch rendering of the worst, smarmiest French intellectual, a man whom vanity impelled towards the humanitarian racket and for whom not believing has become synonymous with honesty. 'It is so late,' Camus's cynic tells his interlocutor as he strives to avoid falling into a canal. 'One is always too late.' Latterly, however, I've begun to appreciate the text in a different fashion. Depressed when he wrote The Fall, Camus began to ask himself a simple question. What would happen to us all if, while, pretending that the lives of others mattered, we ceased to act as if they did? The answer is that we would, like Camus's ex-judge, no longer think of ourselves as human beings. </p> <p>Inevitably the human-rights narrative comes readily peopled with good victims and evil perpetrators. It abounds in worthy clich\u00e9s. My own plea is that in films or articles, human rights politics should be depicted like anything else - not in black and white, as slogans or in pop lyrics, but with the right component of muted, real-life greys. Think of the unassuming, wholly remarkable Canadian Rom\u00e9o Dallaire, who commanded the ill-fated UN force in Rwanda and refused to leave the country. Years later he was found drunk and weeping on a park bench. It appears that Dallaire never recovered from his experiences in Rwanda, though he was always ready to say that his own sufferings were nothing beside the ones he had witnessed. But Dallaire's sense of guilt and complicity proved embarrassing to the media covering his story. For reasons that were never discussed, he never seemed an appropriate protagonist.</p> <p>I also feel that human-rights activists should no longer be sniffy about what Irene Khan calls 'principled pragmatism'. This was the message of Sergio Vieira de Mello, a student of Camus and existentialist philosophy, and the most effective, most dedicated fighter for rights in our time. Brazilian, the son of a diplomat, Sergio began his UN career with a belief that laws and resolutions alone would stop the killing. Speedily disabused, despising the ponderous UN bureaucracy in which he needed to survive, he went to the opposite extreme of seeking to conciliate killers, in the forlorn hope of getting them to behave better. However, it would seem that Sergio's view of the world, too, was altered by Srebrenica. Appointed to the despised, underfunded post of UN Commissioner for Human Rights, he began to read feverishly. </p> <p>He began to see that human rights, far from being an optional extra, to be discarded when they weren't useful, were essential. They were the new global 'rule of law'. Abstractions such as peace and security made sense only if states treated their citizens properly - and were prepared to extend such rights to the citizens of other states. But he also thought that human-rights culture had wrongly neglected the notion of dignity. Freedoms meant nothing if people could have no sense of their own worth. And maybe flawed states with a minimum of democratic practices but some legal rights were better than the pseudo-democracies magicked into existence by an overeager West in the post-communist perception that history had ended. In East Timor, where he ran the UN mission, he was able to put these views into practice, with success.</p> <p>Sergio refused to criticise the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Alone among humanitarians, he was able to meet with George Bush and criticise the American treatment of detainees. He went to Baghdad in the certain expectation that his UN mission would prove to be a failure. On 19 August 2003 he died after a car bomb exploded, turning the UN headquarters into rubble. Charismatic, sexually attractive, Sergio enjoyed life and had no taste for martyrdom - he was just doing what had to be done. He died, as his biographer Samantha Power says, 'buried beneath the weight of the UN itself'. </p> <p>Sergio's last words, spoken to a rescuer eager to give him spiritual comfort, were: 'Fuck God, just get me out of here.' Human rights are indeed a matter of life and death. I can't think of a better slogan for our times than Sergio's.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> To read an edited version of the 1961 Observer article by Peter Benenson that launched Amnesty, go to <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/52o6eu\">tinyurl.com/52o6eu</a></p> <h2>The United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h2> <p>This is an edited version of the rights enshrined in the 1948 declaration's 30 Articles</p> <p><strong>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</p> <p><strong>No one shall be held in slavery or servitude.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is equal before the law.</strong></p> <p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p> <p><strong>Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal in the [event] of any criminal charge against him.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to privacy and to protection by the law from attacks upon his honour and reputation.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to a nationality.</strong></p> <p>Men and women, irrespective of race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and found a family.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to own property.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p> <p><strong>No one may be compelled to belong to an association.</strong></p> <p>Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.</p> <p><strong>Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.</strong></p> <p>The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.

  "<p>This year autumn felt like it had started to take hold way back in the middle of August, and I really fought against it. I wasn't at all ready to let go of the growing season and spent a furious weekend cutting back, tidying and restaking in an attempt to shore up and postpone the impending decay. The Vitis that was strangling the 'Mermaid' rose was pulled away to let the sun back in for a while and I did a ruthless cutback on the herbaceous geraniums to try and promote fresh green growth. I am glad I acted when I did, for the garden wasn't really ready to let go of the summer either and there was plenty more waiting in the wings.</p> <p>Nearly six weeks later and I am happy to let go of the reins. This is because the energy has changed, and where there was still growth in the air there is now a mood of resignation. It really is time to give in and prepare for dormancy. That said, this is often one of the most beautiful months of the year, with soft, low light and warmth in the sun when you can catch it. The garden also has plenty to offer, for it is in the midst of its grand finale - and I am not talking autumn foliage and berries here, but a whole new wave of flowers that have been preparing the summer long for just this moment. In that preparation, they have been looking good, where earlier bloomers have given in and are looking very much post-party.</p> <p>I must remember when ordering my bulbs next year that I dug out my colchicums and gave them to my parents a couple of years ago. It was time for a change when I did it, and they have loved being divided, but I have missed them pushing through this year to mark the end of the summer. Although they are tolerant of a dappled light, they are at their best when basking in autumn sun. Tough sheaths push through the earth and do the backwork needed for the emergence, but the buds which then emerge in clusters are silken and delicate. I love them all, even the double 'Waterlily' - but my favourite is Colchicum autumnale 'Album', and I team it up with Aster diviricatus, the wiry prostrate growth of the aster covering nicely during the summer when the colchicum foliage becomes dormant.</p> <p>I will also remember to get C 'Rose Queen', as it is one of the nicest for naturalising, and I plan to have it coming up with Cyclamen hederifolium under a grove of open magnolias. Both are happy to live under a summer meadow. The thatch is cut at the beginning of August to make way for the flowers and foliage that follow, and I like the way they enliven an area that can all too often look naked once the meadow is stripped.</p> <p>The hardy Amaryllis belladonna are completely dependent upon sunshine and I have them growing in one of the hottest spots in the garden. Though I planted their fist-sized bulbs well below ground 10 years ago, they have lifted themselves above ground now and I would fear for them out in the open in a frost-prone garden. They are worth that prime position at the base of a warm wall and I like to team them up with low-growing Ceratostigma plumbaginoides. This late-flowering groundcover is swathed for weeks with plumbago-like flowers that range from a deep denim to bright cobalt blue. The foliage colours well, too, with odd leaves turning cherry red and turning up the volume.</p> <p>There is warmth in many of the late-summer flowers. The Ipomaea lobata are at their best now, winging their way out of control in the back of the borders. In a hot summer, they self-seed like nasturtiums, but most years it is best to gather the seed and sow a few potfuls inside in March. The same can be said for the Cleome spinosa 'Violet Queen' which will keep me going now with the sedum and the asters. I only have room for one sedum here and have grown to love 'Purple Emperor'. It has ruby-red flowers in late summer, but the colour of the foliage is the thing. It is as potent as red cabbage from the moment it breaks earth to the time it is finally defeated by slugs or frost some time in November.</p> <p>Late Red-Hot Pokers are another spectacular sight at the end of the season, and their colouring couldn't be better with berries and the first of the autumn foliage. I took copious notes on the trials field at Wisley last year, where their sceptres were a draw from the other side of the field. As a result I have 'Tawny King' on trial in a friend's garden, and it has been blooming on and off now since July. The secret with all the kniphofias is to cut the spent flowering stems back to the base once they are over, as they don't offer much in the way of winter skeletons.</p> <p>I have flirted with the Black-eyed Susans in this garden over the years, but I really don't have the room to do them justice. I make up for it vicariously elsewhere, and where there is room for some loftiness and a client that doesn't mind a bit of staking, I plant 'Herbstsonne' (aka 'Autumn Sun') to rise up in front of a west- or south-facing window. It fills the window with artificial sunlight for a good six weeks and more than makes up for the early grip the mellow season has had on this year.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:dan.pearson@observer.co.uk\">dan.pearson@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Observer offer Readers can buy the colourful, late-flowering Rudbeckia 'Herbstsonne' for \u00a38.95 each; or save \u00a35 when you buy three for just \u00a321.85.

On 29 May, Abbey told me it had sent the money to the Skipton building society. Six weeks later, the Skipton confirmed that it did not have my Isa and A&amp;L confirmed that it did. But on 3 July, Lloyds TSB also said it had opened an Isa in my name with money from the Abbey. Lloyds then said the cheque had been stopped and returned to Abbey, although it was enclosed with the letter to me. <br><strong>EJ</strong></p> <p>If that had been the end of your money's tour of UK financial institutions, it would be bad enough. It's no wonder banks take so long to open Isas when they make so many mistakes. But soon after, Lloyds wrote to explain why it had refused the cheque - and confirmed that it had passed the money to Bradford &amp; Bingley! The last time you checked, your money was still safely with A&amp;L, which has credited an extra \u00a3140, presumably for lost interest. At an early stage, Abbey sent you \u00a325 but has now added another \u00a3150 to apologise for the errors.</p> <h2>They cancelled my son's card while he was abroad</h2> <p>Our son has been travelling in the Far East on his gap year, accessing his money with a Nationwide debit card. In June, Nationwide sent him a new card at our address. We phoned Nationwide who told us his existing card would cease to operate in 21 days' time. We checked again and a second person said it would continue for 99 days. We couldn't get the new card to him anyway and a third person told us that his old card would not be cancelled at all. Three weeks later, we received worried messages from our son saying he couldn't use his card and had nowhere to stay. Then that he had been mugged and, ironically, his Nationwide card stolen. We have had to send him money through the Post Office, at a cost.<br><strong>BJ, Hereford</strong></p> <p>The person you first spoke to was the only one who gave correct information. Your son's old card was valid for only 21 days once the new one had been issued. After I brought this to Nationwide's attention, it appreciated the seriousness of his situation. It offered to courier a new card to him but you decided against this as you were not sure where he would be.</p> <p>But you did agree to accept the rest of Nationwide's offer. It has paid \u00a3100 to cover your costs of sending money out to him and the cost of a hotel for one night. It sent you \u00a370 for the cost of changing his air ticket so he could return home early, and of transferring the money. If you had needed to send any more money, it would have paid for that as well. Now that he is back in the UK, Nationwide has apologised to him and offered him \u00a3150 compensation. The expiry dates on their plastic cards is another item for students to check before setting off on their gap year.</p> <h2>We don't need our old will trusts any more. Or do we?</h2> <p>My wife and I have wills with a discretionary trust exploiting the old nil-rate tax band arrangements. Now that the allowance has been doubled for couples, the need has disappeared and it would be easier if we reverted to simple wills. But might retaining the trust arrangements be potentially useful in mitigating care-home costs for the surviving spouse?<br><strong>DN, Oxford</strong></p> <p>When the first partner in a marriage or civil partnership dies, any unused part of that person's inheritance tax nil-rate band can now be transferred to the widow or widower. But it is not transferred automatically. When the second spouse dies, the executors have to prove their entitlement to the Revenue by completing pages of information and producing original documents.</p> <p>But you do not need to change your wills immediately. When the first of you dies, the survivor and trustees have two years in which to decide whether to keep the nil-rate band trust or transfer the inheritance tax allowance instead. This means you can take into account your circumstances at the time.</p> <p>There is an argument for keeping the discretionary trusts if you suspect you might need to pay for nursing care. All the money in the trust is ignored for means-testing purposes, so it is not taken into account when assessing eligibility for help paying nursing home fees. Even so, you still have access to the money in the trust, so you could use it to upgrade to a more expensive nursing home than the local authority provides.</p> <p>Each person's situation is different so do take professional advice before deciding. As a starter, the law firm Cripps Harries Hall has produced this flow chart to help with the decision process: <a href=\"http://www.crippslaw.com/publications/nilrateband.pdf\">crippslaw.com/publications/nilrateband.pdf</a></p> <h2>Where are Standard's cheery letters now?</h2> <p>My Standard Life endowment policy matures in September. For years, most recently last May, I have received 'green' letters from Standard Life advising that the plan was on target. The value if I had cashed it in last February, including early surrender penalties, was \u00a35,443. I assumed by leaving it I would get more. Now I have been told that the final value will be \u00a35,139, which is below target. Is there any point to these letters?<br><strong>PL, London</strong></p> <p>What indeed is the point of sending 'green' letters so close to maturity when they can be wrong? Standard Life says the colour-coded letters assume the plan will grow for the rest of the term at an assumed rate. It also says it was unfortunate that your plan lost value in its final six months. How can an insurer assume investments will always grow, even by a small amount, over such a short period? You suffered even more because the final bonus was slashed a month before your policy matured. Standard must have known back in May this was a possibility. Now that final bonuses are so volatile, insurers should not issue green letters in the final year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Email Margaret Dibben at money.writes@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ and include a telephone number.

  "<p>After Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson refused to use taxpayers' money to bail out stricken bank Lehman Brothers last weekend, many observers said admiringly that he had 'drawn a line in the sand', punishing a badly run institution and refusing to give in to whingeing shareholders. Less than a week later, Lehman's humiliating collapse and the takeover of Merrill Lynch had so bewildered investors that Paulson was preparing to put billions of dollars on the line to rescue the entire US financial system.</p> <p>The decision to let Lehman fall unleashed a wave of panic as shareholders in other banks digested the fact that the government would allow a venerable Wall Street broker to fail. The Federal Reserve's bold decision to leave interest rates unchanged last Tuesday intensified the markets' feelings that they were in scary, uncharted territory.</p> <p>By the end of a nerve-shredding week, it had become clear that the financial sector was incapable of fixing itself, and unless Washington stitched up a broader financial bail-out, it would only be a matter of time before the next floundering Wall Street institution was picked off. Morgan Stanley, and even the mighty Goldman Sachs, appeared to be at risk.</p> <p>Paulson has announced a plan for the taxpayer to take over some of the hard-to-value mortgage-backed assets at the heart of the financial crisis, gathering them together into a government-backed 'bad bank,' allowing crisis-hit financial institutions to shift them off their balance sheets.</p> <p>Analysts said the plan was reminiscent of the Resolution Trust Corporation, formed in the late 1980s to dispose of the assets of a clutch of savings-and-loans banks, which had collapsed. In total, the RTC took over $402bn of bad assets; by the end of 1995, when it finished selling them off and was wound down, taxpayers had lost $88bn.</p> <p>Simon Ward at investment firm New Star argues that this time a bail-out could be much more complicated. The embattled institutions still have shareholders, so Washington will have to decide how much, if anything, to pay them in exchange for taking the toxic assets off their hands. 'I can't see how you value these things - you'd need the wisdom of Solomon,' he says.</p> <p>Stephen Lewis, of Monument Securities, says there are huge risks attached to rushing through such potentially costly proposals: 'The danger, if the legislative process is rushed, is that any resulting legal foundation for the \"RTC Mark Two\" would be less than solid. More likely, there will be no quick agreement in Congress over the specific role and financing of the \"bad\" institution.'</p> <p>The crisis began in thousands of homes as hard-pressed borrowers struggled to repay their mortgages. Many had been given loans they would never be able to repay; as they defaulted in droves, the effects reverberated all the way up to the world of high finance.</p> <p>Despite their sophisticated 'risk management' models and complex ways of apparently hedging their bets, no one working for the financial giants anticipated how many home loans could go sour, leading to a vicious cycle of multi-billion-dollar write-offs for the banks. They then tightened the supply of credit to American homes, in a desperate attempt to repair their balance sheets, pushing house prices down still further.</p> <p>Paulson's decision to step in and effectively nationalise the giant mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a fortnight ago was an attempt to prevent the supply of mortgages drying up completely and bring the housing market decline under control.</p> <p>US house prices peaked in the middle of 2006 and have been declining ever since. According to the Case-Shiller index, which traces repeat sales of the same property in 10 key cities, prices are now down by 19 per cent.</p> <p>'Nobody had been issuing private mortgage-backed securities since last year,' says Paul Ashworth, US economist at consultancy Capital Economics. 'Fannie and Freddie were the only game in town, and in saving them, and reducing their funding costs, we should see slightly lower mortgage rates.'</p> <p>But Paulson is playing a high-stakes game. The bailouts - of Fannie and Freddie, insurer AIG, and now, potentially, the entire financial system - will blow a vast hole in the public finances, which were already deteriorating as a result of the economic slowdown.</p> <p>'The budget deficit is going to balloon,' says Ashworth. Russell Jones, chief strategist at RBC Capital Markets, believes that as a proportion of GDP, the deficit is already close to a post-war record, at 6.75 per cent. 'The state of the public balance sheet is horrid,' he adds.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, described the $85bn bail-out of insurer AIG as a 'rip-off situation'.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, the Treasury announced that it was seeking $40bn of fresh funding from the financial markets, in a 'temporary supplementary financing programme', to shore up the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve - in effect borrowing money to ensure that Fed chairman Ben Bernanke can afford to keep pouring cash into the money markets. But the cost of the proposed 'bad bank' plan, which will have to be agreed by Congress, could dwarf the price of any of the rescues the Fed or the Treasury have carried out so far.</p> <p>The yield on Treasury bills - in effect, the price of borrowing for the government - jumped after the plan was mooted on Thursday, and taxpayers will end up footing the cost. The deteriorating state of the finances could put the dollar under pressure.</p> <p>Of course, if the mortgage-backed assets prove to be worth much more than the government pays for them, the Treasury could make a profit - but for the time being few investors would bet on that.</p>",
  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>My wife and I want to pack our bags and run off for a year to travel around America. I understand we will not be able to get a year's visa. Is it possible to do three months at a time then nip out to Canada or Mexico, renew our visa and then re-enter? <br><strong>Tony Harris</strong>, by email</p> <p>Check and double-check visa rules and procedures for the US, as one wrong move could see your dreams grounded. Importantly, also note that border officials have the right to refuse you entry even if your paperwork is in order. Under the terms of the Visa Waiver Programme, which allows most British travellers to enter the US without applying in advance, visitors are granted 90 days in the country. If you leave the US to visit an adjacent country (Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and Caribbean Islands) then re-enter the US, the time you were overseas counts towards your 90-day total. One solution, according to the US visa information helpline (09042 450100; calls cost \u00a31.20 a minute) is to apply for a tourist visa like nationals of other countries. A B-2 holiday visa can be valid for anything from three months to 10 years with the length of stay determined by the immigration official when you arrive. If you have firm plans in place you should secure an initial stay of six months, which may be renewable for another six. To apply for a B-2 you'll need to book an interview and pay the relevant non-refundable fee (\u00a379) - see www.usembassy.org.uk.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> My partner and I want to take our two sons (who will be 13 and 11) to France next summer. The plan is to take the Eurostar to Paris, where we will spend three days seeing the sights. We want to keep our carbon footprint as small as possible, so we would like to take another train somewhere south for a seven-night 'beach' holiday. We are looking for somewhere that is easily accessible by train and close to all amenities without ending up in the French equivalent of Blackpool. We have about \u00a3100 per night to spend on accommodation. Any suggestions?<br><strong>K Whitmore</strong>, Brighton</p> <p>I asked Carolyn Boyd, Editor of France magazine (<a href=\"http://www.francemag.com\">www.francemag.com</a>) for her recommendations. First up is Arg\u00e8les-sur-Mer, near Perpignan. The beach is 2.5km from the station, but you can find a g\u00eete, holiday apartment or even camp closer to the coast. The town's tourism website (<a href=\"http://www.argeles-sur-mer.com\">www.argeles-sur-mer.com</a>) has links to accommodation. The town's family credentials are reinforced by the watersports, walking trails and summer festivals. Like everywhere on the coast, it gets very busy in summer, so book well ahead.</p> <p>Boyd also suggests Antibes for families: 'It has a great family atmosphere, with a touch of Riviera chic, while its 25km of coastline boasts fine sandy beaches and creeks. The historic old town, with its fishing harbour and world-famous Picasso connections, is great for the grown-ups, while the Marine Land theme park is a good family day out.' The Hotel Astor (00 33 4 9293 3400, <a href=\"http://www.hotel-astor1.com\">www.hotel-astor1.com</a>) in nearby Juan-les-Pins has a studio for four people that costs \u20ac88 mid-season. For details of all TER (regional rail) services see www.ter-sncf.com. </p> <p><strong>Q </strong>I am planning a gap year which has led to some difficult flights. I need to fly from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to Antananarivo in Madagascar in March 2009, though I am fairly flexible on the date. Is there any way of doing this without going to Johannesburg? I am a student and need to keep costs down.<br><strong>Rachel James</strong>, by email</p> <p>It's still difficult to fly within Africa and from Africa to the Indian Ocean islands and costs can be high if you don't buy your ticket in conjunction with an international ticket. In many cases, the easiest route is via Europe or South Africa. However, Kenya Airways has recently started flying from Nairobi to Antananarivo and has good connections from Dar Es Salaam. Africa Travel Centre (0845 450 1520; <a href=\"http://www.africatravel.co.uk\">www.africatravel.co.uk</a>) can book this flight for \u00a3552 one-way, including taxes.</p> <p>While this option doesn't offer a huge saving on flying via Johannesburg, the flight has other advantages. Firstly, it is faster and involves fewer hours in the air. Secondly, it requires no overnight stops, leaving Dar early in the morning with a two-hour stop in Nairobi, and arrives in Madagascar in time for lunch at the excellent Sakamanga in downtown Tana (<a href=\"http://www.sakamanga.com\">www.sakamanga.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>Next month I will be spending 24 hours in LA. I arrive on a Monday lunchtime and fly out late Tuesday afternoon. I will not have a car and am not a theme park fan, so was wondering what recommendations you have? I was planning to stay in an airport hotel - the Custom hotel - as this would be the most practical distance-wise.<br><strong>Robert Cowie</strong>, by email </p> <p>Staying at the airport is perfect for a quick getaway, but means you'll be heading to and from the airport at least twice if you're planning Monday evening and Tuesday morning excursions into town. For this reason, you may wish to limit your excursions to neighbourhoods that are closer to the airport. A short taxi ride away is Santa Monica, perfect for a first taste of LA life, an evening beachfront stroll, a trendy drink on Ocean Avenue or Third Street Promenade. Morning options include Venice Beach, great fun for browsing the hip boutiques of Abbot-Kinney Boulevard as well as the jumble of characters, street hawkers and sun-worshippers that congregate here. Even closer to LAX, Manhattan Beach is another good neighbourhood to ramble around for a few hours. <br><strong><br>Feedback</strong></p> <p>In response to Lucy Metcalfe's request (Letters, 7 September) about cruising in the Arctic, we can highly recommend Naturetrek (<a href=\"http://www.naturetrek.co.uk\">www.naturetrek.co.uk</a>). We flew to Spitzbergen, then boarded a small ship. There were only 48 of us. We circumnavigated the islands, landing frequently in zodiacs. There was a geologist, an ornithologist, a botanist, an historian, and leader with over 20 years experience in the Arctic. We saw polar bears, arctic fox, reindeer, walrus, seal, whales and lots of birds. It was the trip of a lifetime. <br><strong>Anne Hames</strong>, by email</p> <p>You recommended (Letters, 7 September) that readers from Cardiff who wanted to go to Sydney without driving all the way up to Heathrow should fly from Bristol. In fact, there's no need as KLM fly to Sydney, via Amsterdam, from Cardiff. <br><strong>Joanne Benson</strong>, Cardiff</p>",
  "<h2>Russia</h2> <p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's popularity rests on Russia's impressive economic growth in recent years, built largely on exploiting its natural resources. As President, he bought many privatised gas and oil companies back under government control, and rising energy prices have boosted state coffers. But there are fears that banks have lent too much and last week stock market trading was suspended three times as shares crashed and then bounced back dramatically. The RTS Index has fallen by half this year, making it one of the worst performers globally, and anxiety about the invasion of Georgia is also undermining confidence. Russia's central bank last week provided the three major banks - Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank - with $44bn in emergency funding to improve liquidity. But the country's finances are in much better shape now than 10 years ago, when it defaulted on its international debts and triggered a global financial crisis, forcing the IMF to bail it out. Today, there is nearly $600bn in central bank reserves. </p> <p><strong>China</strong></p> <p>According to the economic theory of 'decoupling', China, with other emerging industrial powerhouses in the developing world, could continue to drive global growth in the event of an American slowdown. That analysis is now being tested at a time when China's expansion - its GDP has grown by around 10 per cent or more this decade - appears to be slowing. </p> <p>Last week, it cut interest rates for the first time in six years, despite fears about inflation, demonstrating it is concerned about the effects of falling US demand. It will be hit hard if its customers in the industrialised nations spend less, and there have already been factory closures. Growth rates for exports and incomes for city-dwellers are also down from last year - the latter tumbled from 14.2 per cent in the first six months of 2007 to 6.3 per cent in the equivalent period this year. But growing domestic demand could keep the economy afloat; Chinese retail sales are rising by about 20 per cent a year. </p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong></p> <p>Until last week, it was business as usual in Brazil. Foreign investors regarded it as a safe haven, attracted by an expanding affluent class and the most stable economic conditions for a decade. While the London stock market shrank by 1.5 per cent during 2007, its S\u00e3o Paulo counterpart expanded by 93 per cent on a flood of foreign investment. </p> <p>But, last Wednesday, the S\u00e3o Paulo stock exchange tumbled 6.74 per cent amid a sell-off that battered financial stocks, and fears that foreign investors will sell their Brazilian assets. Shares in house builders plummeted on expectation that credit will now be harder to come by and the booming housing market will grind to a halt, and economists warned that growth rate in the biggest Latin American economies would fall by at least one percentage point as a result of the fallout from the US crisis. </p> <p><strong>The eurozone</strong></p> <p>The ECB pumped \u20ac100bn into the financial system last week in a bid to ensure there are no banking collapses on the continent to mirror those in the US and the UK. The biggest eurozone countries have so far remained relatively unscathed, although some are more vulnerable than others. In Spain and Ireland, property bubbles burst before the crisis in the US sub-prime market, and both countries are likely to slip into recession. But the largest eurozone countries, Germany and France, are partly buttressed by more cautious lending and tighter restrictions on personal credit. Although the global slowdown will restrict economic growth, Germany's BdB, which represents the country's private banks, said last week: 'There is no statistical evidence of a credit crunch in Germany.' </p> <p><strong>Japan</strong></p> <p>Japan has already experienced a credit crunch, triggered when a real-estate crash in the early Nineties revealed the extent of the exposure to the country's collapsing commercial property market. If the 1929 Wall Street Crash provides governments with a useful guide to how not to handle an economic crisis, Japan's financial implosion also gives them a more recent example. </p> <p>The failure of Lehman Brothers' Japanese arm constitutes the country's second-largest bankruptcy ever, but officials insist there is little danger of history repeating itself. Bank of Japan governor Masaaki Shirakawa down- played concern that the US crisis will hurt the world's second-largest economy and said Japan's financial system remains stable. 'Most lending to Lehman Brothers was made by major Japanese banks and their potential losses seem to be within the levels that can be covered by their profits,' he said.</p> <p>After the Nineties crisis, it was nearly a decade before Japanese banks began to lend freely to each other. Policymakers in the West will be hoping that America can recover far more quickly.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Halifax was offering customers of Lloyds TSB \u00a3100 to swap to one of its current accounts. Last week, Lloyds TSB said it was shelling out around \u00a3600 for every one of the 22 million customers of Halifax and Bank of Scotland in a \u00a313.2bn takeover of the HBOS banking giant.</p> <p>This is not an expensive case of tit for tat: rather it is a potent symbol of the impact the credit crunch is having on the banking industry. As recently as a month ago, a merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB would have been unthinkable: together, they will have 28 per cent of the mortgage market, operate one in three current accounts held by British consumers and own two of the strongest brands in life assurance in Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical. Yet the Office of Fair Trading, which blocked Lloyds TSB's attempt to acquire the much smaller Abbey National seven years ago, has been forced by the government to wave this deal through.</p> <p>While HBOS chairman Lord Stevenson angrily rebuffed suggestions that the bank was on its knees, the haste with which the deal was stitched up - encouraged and aided by the government and the Financial Services Authority - reflected serious concerns that Britain's biggest mortgage lender could be forced out of business. And while its senior executives were touring the television studios insisting that it had plenty of capital, the City was sending its shares spiralling to a low of just 88p, a third of the price at which it issued new shares as recently as July and a fraction of the 1,165p achieved little over a year ago.</p> <p>While there was no immediate danger of its running out of money, more than half of its funding provisions- a colossal \u00a3156bn - was due to mature within a year. With financial markets in turmoil following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the effective nationalisation of AIG, investors were betting that, even if it could roll over those facilities, it would be at exorbitant rates. And investors had shunned its \u00a34bn capital-raising in July so were unlikely to be responsive to another rights issue. That left it dangerously exposed.</p> <p>It also left Eric Daniels, the urbane American chief executive of Lloyds TSB, with the opportunity of a lifetime. Having spent most of his five years at the helm selling assets and restoring Lloyds' reputation following the ill-conceived purchase of Scottish Widows, he was on the acquisition trail. His interest in acquiring Northern Rock last year foundered on a lack of government support; he had considered Bradford &amp; Bingley and Alliance &amp; Leicester but they were too small to make a real difference, even without the concerns about their buy-to-let lending and risky financial structures. </p> <p>He had held talks with HBOS during the summer but any deal would have been referred immediately to the Competition Commission - and, with the markets in their febrile state, he would not contemplate subjecting the bank to that long period of uncertainty. </p> <p>All that changed last week when Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank met Gordon Brown at a Citigroup reception in Canary Wharf on Monday; Blank was left in little doubt that the government viewed a banking monopoly as preferable to another Northern Rock-style nationalisation fiasco and would give its nod to any deal. Talks between the two banks resumed and, with HBOS's shares in freefall, the announcement was rushed out on Thursday morning.</p> <p>Sir Victor said that both customers and employees would benefit from 'being part of this great enterprise'. Both these parties are unconvinced. HBOS's aggressive attempts to win banking customers from the Big Four - a strategy pioneered by HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby when he was head of the bank's retail business - had brought big benefits in the shape of high interest current accounts, attractive deals for small businesses and generous mortgage promises. Consumer watchdogs think these deals will quickly disappear from the merged business.</p> <p>Daniels told The Observer yesterday that he expected there to be big opportunities to boost the revenue of the combined group. 'With our big distribution network and complementarity of branches I think we can serve customers extremely well.' </p> <p>But analysts fear that attrition is more likely: combined, the two groups already have relationships with four consumers out of 10 and it is likely that these have already been subject to concerted attempts at cross-selling.</p> <p>Employees, too, are worried. While Daniels dismissed suggestions that 40,000 of the 140,000 combined workforce could go, he has said he expects to cut around 10 per cent, or \u00a31bn, of costs, implying 14,000 redundancies. The City believes that is far too conservative - RBS cut 20 per cent of costs when it acquired the admittedly much less efficient NatWest. The slump in the mortgage market means that HBOS was already shedding jobs and more were expected to go even before the merger.</p> <p>The alliance has not solved HBOS's capital problems - instead, it has made Lloyds TSB's position worse. The new bank's 'tier 1' capital ratios - a key measure of its financial strength - will be just 5.9 per cent, short of the 6 per cent level preferred by Lloyds TSB. 'That is a bit below where I would like it to be,' says Chris White, banking specialist at Threadneedle Asset Management. 'I cannot rule out their raising capital in the future, which would dilute some of the gains.'</p> <p>Lloyds seems to agree: it took the opportunity of Friday's market bounce to place 5 per cent of its shares, raising \u00a3767m. And, much to the chagrin of investors who have stuck with its shares for their generous dividend yield, it has said it will rebase its payout to 40 per cent of earnings - last year it paid out more than 60 per cent of its earnings - and will distribute this year's dividend in shares rather than cash.</p> <p>Nor has it solved the short-term funding problem: while Lloyds got more than 60 per cent of its funding from customers' savings and deposits, HBOS's proportion was just 52 per cent and that means the combined group will still rely on the wholesale markets for about 45 per cent of its financing. The ratio of loans to assets of the group will also be relatively high, at around 160 per cent, reflecting HBOS's more aggressive approach.</p> <p>'They will have to continue the process of selling assets and deleveraging the HBOS balance sheet,' says White. </p> <p>But he is enthusiastic about the deal. 'I take my hat off to Eric. He has transformed the Lloyds TSB business and created a strong institution. This is the opportunity he has been waiting for.'</p> <p>While, on the face of it, the price it is paying seems cheap - at around \u00a313bn in Lloyds TSB shares, it is only around half the book value of HBOS's assets - White expects that significant write-downs in the value of HBOS's assets will slash that book value. These are likely to be focused on the property and private equity portfolios built up by Peter Cummings and his corporate team through the funding of everything from Wembley Stadium to backing Sir Philip Green.</p> <p>While Daniels said he was excited about the idea of combining the private equity business with his own Development Capital arm, and was sanguine about the extent of the two banks' \u00a360bn property exposure, analysts expect a dramatic scaling-back of the level of risk in the combined group. </p> <p>These kind of exposures were another key reason for the City's nervousness about HBOS shares - and for dissatisfaction with the performance of its chief executive. While the aggressive expansion into high-risk areas like buy-to-let mortgages and leveraged finance began under his predecessor Sir James Crosby, Hornby stands accused of failing to recognise the risks quickly enough and position the bank for the new, more risk-averse, climate. Dubbed the 'wonder kid' when he got the top job in 2006 aged less than 40, he was poached from Asda and has a retailing background. </p> <p>'Management has not come out of this well,' says one leading investor. 'It was more vulnerable than its competitors and management must take the blame for that and the fact that they have sold out at what will be deemed to be a very low level.</p> <p>'Hornby carried on regardless [after succeeding Crosby] when, if he had been concerned about the strategy, he had ample time to do something about it. I would be very surprised if he gets a senior role in the new organisation.'</p> <p>Daniels refuses to be drawn on the role Hornby or any of the HBOS executives will play in the combined bank - although he insists Hornby will still be around in a year's time. 'I have the highest respect for his skills,' he says.</p> <p>In turn, Blank describes the deal as a 'landmark day' for the financial services industry. 'It is a unique opportunity to create the largest and best financial services group in Britain,' he says. Once the deal has been bedded down, he holds out the prospect of using the group's financial muscle to expand overseas.</p> <p>But the immediate challenge is to meld the two parts while steering the group through the worst financial crisis in a century. If it succeeds, it will be - as Daniels claims - a 'wonderful franchise'. But the penalties for failure will be high.</p> <h2>Demolition of the building societies</h2> <p>Before it added TSB to its name, Lloyds kicked off the fad for building society demutualisations when it acquired Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester in 1995. That sparked a rush to the stock market as six former societies floated - spurred on by 'carpet-bagging' members salivating over the prospect of large windfalls - while four more were acquired by rival banks.</p> <p>Ironically, Lloyds TSB's acquisition of HBOS has also effectively marked the end of its dalliance with the market. A few days before that deal was announced, Alliance &amp; Leicester secured approval for its takeover by Spanish bank Banco Santander, which already owns former society Abbey National.</p> <p>With the Woolwich now part of Barclays and Northern Rock in government hands, that leaves Bradford &amp; Bingley as the sole remaining former building society on the stock market - and the consensus is that it, too, will be acquired as soon as new chief executive Richard Pym has tidied up its operations. </p> <p>While customers who sold out quickly will have made healthy sums, those who held on, believing that stock markets are for the long term, will be bitterly regretting it. Halifax (which merged with Bank of Scotland to become HBOS) shares were worth 732.5p when it demutualised 11 years ago and reached a peak of 1165p a year ago: Lloyds TSB's offer values the shares at around 215p. Santander's all-share offer for A&amp;L is worth around 263p, less than half the 542.5p price when it floated; Northern Rock's shares climbed from 500p to a peak of more than 1200p last spring before nationalisation this year effectively made them worthless; Bradford &amp; Bingley's shares stand at little over a tenth of their 248p demutualisation price.</p> <p>The former societies that succumbed early have fared better: Abbey National's shareholders received the equivalent of 650p from Santander compared with a 100p flotation price, while Barclays paid 352p for the Woolwich compared with 296.5p at demutualisation. </p> <p>Stock market pressure on these former societies to deliver constantly rising profits is one factor behind the credit crunch. Bigger profits generally mean offering bigger loans to more people; to finance that, the banks sought new sources of funds, such as securitisations and money market borrowings, rather than relying on depositors. These bigger loans drove up house prices, encouraging more borrowing by banks and their customers. It is that process which is being rather painfully unravelled.</p>",

  "<p>It was the last weekend of summer - the Democratic convention looming; a late heatwave baffling the chills of fall - when I drove upstate from New York City to meet Philip Roth at home in northwest Connecticut. It's like Switzerland round here - sparkling streams; plush, manicured properties; perfect meadows - with countless American flags advertising an air of patriotic entitlement. Roth's remote grey clapboard house, dating to the revolution, is high on a hill down a quiet country road, not hard to find, but some miles from the nearest village, which is really a nothing place with two antique stores.</p> <p>The tall figure who emerges from among the apple trees in greeting wears grey tracksuit bottoms and a long-sleeved grey sweatshirt that makes me think of prison garb in some progressive correctional regime. Before I find the composure to take in the burning intensity of his expression, the smooth grey features and interrogative tilt of the head, reminiscent of an American eagle, my first impression is that Philip Roth looks as much like a Supreme Court judge on furlough as one of his country's most admired writers.</p> <p>In his own words, from the opening of The Ghost Writer, you could 'begin to understand why hiding out twelve hundred feet up in the mountains with just the birds and the trees might not be a bad idea for a writer, Jewish or not... Purity. Serenity. Simplicity. Seclusion. All one's concentration and flamboyance and originality reserved for the gruelling, exalted, transcendent calling.' Like his hero Zuckerman, Roth seems to have thought, 'This is how I will live.'</p> <p>We walk slowly across the cool, nicely rambling grass to a kind of gauzy yurt, a converted fruit cage with garden chairs in which Roth and his guests can enjoy bug-free conversation. Stepping into this bubble feels like entering the outdoor jurisdiction of the writer's mind.</p> <p>'Let's work,' says Roth, stretching back on his sun-baked recliner to signal the start of the interview. It sounds informal, but the truth is that all conversations with the author of Portnoy's Complaint are highly controlled: your questions submitted in advance; the transcript scrutinised afterwards; the watchful eye of agents and publicists along the way. Make no mistake: we are being admitted into a well-defended environment.</p> <p>In the American literary undergrowth, Philip Roth is a big beast as fabulous as the hippogriff, rarely sighted, spoken of with awe, and the subject of wild, sometimes scandalised, gossip. Ever since Portnoy, he has endured the kind of attention that might drive you to crave solitude, or into paranoia: incessant self-abuse jokes, a persistent drizzle of hostility and the envious scrutiny of lesser writers. Now, more than 50 years after he began to write, the author of The Counterlife and American Pastoral might agree with Peter De Vries, who observed of American literary life that 'one dreams of the goddess Fame - and winds up with the bitch Publicity'.</p> <p>This house in Connecticut represents the private, contemplative Roth. His apartment in New York sponsors something more public. There, as his literary biographer Hermione Lee has written, 'going out with Philip Roth in Manhattan is like going out with Louis XIV in Versailles: the king is in his kingdom'. The writer himself says that his appetite for exposure lies somewhere between the reclusiveness of JD Salinger and the self-advertising of the late Norman Mailer. </p> <p>Flitting between the private and the public, Roth today is as much of a literary celebrity as either of these near contemporaries. He owes this to Portnoy of course, and also to his lifetime's writing: Roth has never taken his eyes off the prize, or neglected the artistic duty of work. Compared with his peers, and compared with virtually any American writer of stature, Roth's output, for a man in his seventies and with some 29 books behind him, is astonishing. Never a day passes when he does not stare at those three hateful words: qwertyuiop, asdfghjkl, and zxcvbnm. 'I'm over in my studio most of the day,' he says. 'I return to the house every night, like a workman coming back from the fiction factory: \"I'm home, honey.\"'</p> <p>Except that now there's no honey at home. Divorced from his second wife, Claire Bloom, in 1993, Roth lives totally alone out here, cooking his own meals and keeping to himself. 'I've fallen out of any kind of social world,' he says. </p> <p>'I don't really know anybody up here any longer.' </p> <p>Once, he lived here year round, but in old age he finds the winters too brutal. He has 'a place in New York' and says that when he's there 'I see people; usually I have dinner with somebody in the evening.' But, either in the country or the city, he sticks to the schedule he's always worked, morning, noon and night, 365 days a year. 'I am,' he once said, 'very much like somebody who spends all day writing.'</p> <p>Now he's more isolated than ever. 'All my friends around here have died,' he says, running through the honour roll. 'Richard Widmark? Dick died about two months ago. Arthur Miller, he died; he lived half an hour away. And Bill Styron. And I had a very good pal, a doctor in the next town over who I was very close to. So I'm four for four,' he says, sadly slipping into baseball jargon. Death, observed WH Auden, is like the rumble of distant thunder at a picnic. Roth's roll-call tells him that the picnic is drawing to a close, that death is out there, waiting. 'It seems to creep into one book after another,' he remarks. </p> <p>'I don't think anybody's gotten out alive in my last five books.' </p> <p>With Roth, art and life are strangely braided. 'I made a list of people who've died in the past few years. It's staggering. The funerals and the eulogies keep it all in mind.' Does he speak at these funerals? 'I speak at some. It's not a genre I've mastered, the eulogy. I find it very difficult.'</p> <p>Similarly, Roth can't quite believe his age. 'I'm 75, a strange number,' he volunteers. 'It's a strange discovery, for me at any rate. In your early years you don't go to funerals every six months.' Among his peers, there has been a steady winnowing: Arthur Miller, George Plimpton, Kurt Vonnegut, and most recently, Norman Mailer. These were not all close friends, but he knows he's playing in injury time. </p> <p>Roth's place in American letters is not just a matter of seniority, or productivity. The sequence of novels, well-wrought explorations of his country's recent past, that began in 1997 when Roth was in his mid-sixties - an age when many writers would have been content to rest on their laurels - amounts to an extraordinary portrait that has been saluted by critics on both sides of the Atlantic: American Pastoral, an elegy for American family life set in the Vietnam era; his blistering portrait of Eve Frame in I Married A Communist (1998); The Human Stain (2000); The Dying Animal (2001); The Plot Against America (2004); Everyman (2006) and finally, his farewell to Zuckerman, Exit Ghost (2007). This list is testament to as remarkable a late-season career surge as any in living memory and leaves all his competitors standing in his dust. </p> <p>And it's not over yet. His latest, Indignation, was published last week. He knows it's short, and possibly slight. A volume of some 230 pages, Indignation narrates the morphine-induced recollections of the young Marcus Messner, a fatally wounded conscript in the Korean war. Messner will die in the closing pages of the novel, and it is ambiguous how much his memories are actually posthumous or feverishly imagined on the point of death.</p> <p>Humorously, Roth says it stands somewhere between a novella and, 'a worse word', a novelette. 'The publisher called it a novel. They tell me \"novel\" is a better word to use.' In repose, Roth's expression can be severe, even intimidating. When he smiles, everything lights up, and for a moment the world becomes an easier place to be. </p> <p>People who are close to him, friends I spoke to in London and New York, always say that, in the right mood, he can be one of the funniest men alive. But today he is working, explaining how he made his latest book from the discarded pages of another story, and the occasional laugh lines in this conversation do not translate into print.</p> <p>In American literature, the 'posthumous novel' is a rare device, exploited most recently in Alice Sebold's bestseller The Lovely Bones. Momentarily professorial, Roth is quick to acknowledge that it's not original, pointing out that Epitaph for a Small Winner, by the 19th-century Brazilian writer Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, employs the same narrative point of view. The truth is that it's not wholly successful, though the prose seems undiminished; but Roth is untroubled. 'In the morphine sleep he doesn't know where he is, so he imagines he's dead... If it's ambiguous, that's OK, too.'</p> <p>Anyway, Roth's real concern in Indignation is to explore the world of a Jewish boy, born and raised in Newark in the Thirties and Forties, a young man who flees his over-protective parents to enrol in a liberal arts college away from home and come of age in the America of the Fifties, a young man curiously similar, in outward appearance, to Roth himself.</p> <p>At this point veteran Roth readers will exclaim with a sigh, Here we go again. But what did they expect? The point about Roth is that he is the most interesting person he knows, and quite unabashed about his extraordinary singularity. </p> <p>Describing his own chapel attendances at Bucknell College in rural Pennsylvania, which mirror those of Marcus Messner, he says he felt 'like a Houyhnhnm who had strayed on to the campus from Gulliver's Travels'.</p> <p>That is the writer's authentic voice. Roth, as Martin Amis says, 'is somehow inordinately unique. He is himself, himself, himself.' To another of his many interviewers he declared, simply: 'I'm the emergency.' Sitting here in the afternoon sunshine, he instinctively frames himself as a character, almost in the third person. 'I'm like an old man,' he says, as if not quite willing to concede that he might actually be old. Friends confirm that there is no one more competitive with himself than Roth. Similarly, if there is one person who has celebrated Philip Roth and his legend it must be Roth himself. What interests him, he writes in Deception, 'is the terrible ambiguity of the \"I\", the way a writer makes a myth of himself and, particularly, why'. One place to start might be his origins.</p> <p>Philip Roth was born into a family of second-generation Jews, 'before pantyhose and frozen food,' he says, in the year of Hitler's rise to power, 1933. His parents were intensely, even maddeningly, devoted to their son. 'To be at all,' he writes of his mother and father in his autobiography, The Facts, 'is to be her Philip, but in the embroilment of the buffeting world, my history still takes its spin from beginning as his Roth.'</p> <p>Roth's sensibilities will always be marked by the themes and tempo of the 'low, dishonest decade' into which he was born, but just as influential was his milieu: a lower middle-class Jewish community in Newark, New Jersey, across the river from Manhattan, a suburban city that occupies the kind of relation to the metropolis that, say, Croydon does to London. </p> <p>He was, and is, a passionate American, a baseball fanatic who at one point cheerfully refers to himself as 'a Yank'. After himself, the great, wounded republic is his subject. Years ago, in The Facts, he wrote: 'It's hard to imagine that anyone of intelligence growing up in America since the Vietnam War can have had our unambiguous sense, as young adolescents immediately after the victory over Nazi fascism and Japanese militarism, of belonging to the greatest nation on earth.' Today, looking back at the Fifties from a post-Bush perspective, he disputes this, saying, 'There never was a golden age.' It is, nonetheless, a moment in American history that dominates the brief narrative of Indignation</p> <p>The Newark of Roth's childhood was 'still largely white', but already in decline, which is perhaps why he remains so attached to it. Today, the city is almost wholly black, with a black mayor and the civic afflictions of drug-related criminality. 'My old neighbourhood is bad, but the whole city is bad. Downtown, there's lots of people selling stuff on the street, mostly stolen goods. I wouldn't wander around the streets by myself. So it's pretty bad, and very depressing, too.' </p> <p>Newark and Newarkness shaped Roth's life profoundly, and continue to do so, as though he has never left. He and his fellow Newark-ite Paul Auster like to speculate about making a literary pilgrimage to their roots. He says, half in jest: 'We'd have to take a cop with us. It's very dangerous.' Indignation, indeed, opens in Newark and celebrates its ethnic vitality with a thunderous crescendo: 'hard-working, coarse-grained, bribe-ridden, semi-xenophobic Irish-Italian-German-Slavic-Jewish-Negro Newark'.</p> <p>Many of the great American writers are creatures of their neighbourhood. Bellow has Chicago, Fitzgerald jazz-age Manhattan, and Faulkner Yoknapatawpha County. Updike cleaves to Massachusetts, and for Roth it's Newark. So much so that the city has named a plaza for him. He's proud of this, in an ironical way. 'You'll score better drugs on Roth Plaza than Malamud Plaza,' he jokes, adding that 'the then mayor has now been indicted, tried, and convicted on various illegalities.'</p> <p>In old age, he recoils from urban extremism, but as a young man he relished it. Roth has said his adolescent experience was 'about our aggression, our going out into Newark, three or four of us, wandering the streets at night, shooting crap in back of the high school with flashlights, girls, going after your date to this gathering place called Syd's on Chancellor Avenue and telling your sex stories... Appetite. Maybe that's the word. It was the appetites that were aggressive.' </p> <p>In this highly verbal, frustrated and competitive hothouse the young Roth incubated the wild, comic voice that would explode into American consciousness with Portnoy's notorious 'complaint'. The Jewishness of old Newark shaped Roth in another way, too. Through all the subsequent phases of his literary life, there is a consistent character thread, which many readers have found intensely, almost viscerally, appealing. Perhaps it was this psychic inheritance that inspired Roth to boast about 'my good fortune in being born a Jew'. As much as he is infuriated by the predicament in which it has landed him, he enjoys the originality. 'It's a complicated, interesting, morally demanding and very singular experience,' he says, 'and I like that.' </p> <p>The classic Roth protagonist, who surfaces once again in Indignation, is painfully intelligent, self-aware and over-protected. An instinctive aesthete, he is divided between mind and body, sex and reason, family and self, desire and duty. A martyr to neurasthenia, this troubled figure is tormented by impossible (even mad) women, overweening parents and, worst of all, a bad conscience. Over the years, Roth has had a hard time from some feminists, and now strongly resists the suggestion that there is - shall we say? - a strain of craziness in many of his fictional women.</p> <p>'Well, let's see,' he replies equably, as if enunciating a quasi-biblical exegesis. 'In Exit Ghost there isn't, I don't think. There are two sane women there. And in Everyman the women are all sane. There's a crazy one in When She Was Good (1967) and another in My Life As a Man (1974). I think proportional to the population I have the right number of crazy women.' So, there you are, QED.</p> <p>Roth's novels brilliantly anatomise the manic carousel of passionate feelings. Mixed with the volatile chemistry of his own temperament, his Jewishness and an indefinable lower middle-class awkwardness vis \u00e0 vis that great unmentionable, American class, seem to have inspired plenty of rage, to use a less genteel synonym for 'indignation'. 'Rage', 'revenge', 'acrimony' - these words pop up all over the landscape of Roth's work. Now, perhaps, in his mid-seventies, there's a softening. The 'indignation' of his new book may be 'the most beautiful word in the English language', but it comes from the Chinese national anthem, the one we all heard during the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>Like Marcus Messner, the young Roth was taught in grade school by left-leaning teachers who, in addition to patriotic songs such as 'Anchors Away', at weekly assembly, encouraged their kids to learn clunky Chinese propaganda:</p> <p>Arise, ye who refuse to be bondslaves!</p> <p>Indignation fills the hearts of all our countrymen,</p> <p>Arise! Arise! Arise!</p> <p>In one of the more surreal scenes from America's wartime mobilisation, Roth says that in Newark you had 'all these little Jewish kids belting out the Chinese national anthem! The only Chinese we knew was the laundryman.'</p> <p>We agree, now, that this is a lost world, almost as remote as the stagecoach or the silver dollar. Who, meeting the grade A student Philip Milton Roth in 1953 (the year in which he locates the end of Indignation) could have foreseen his literary life? The Roth of myth was yet to come, and all but invisible. </p> <p>In the Fifties, indeed, young Roth followed a career path that might have fashioned him into the kind of literature professor you might find in one of his novels - sombre, mildly lecherous, immersed in literature. 'I thought I was going to be an English professor, but six months into my PhD I couldn't stand it. So I dropped out, and began to write. I got $800 from Esquire for a story.'</p> <p>Looking back on those times, he confesses to a pessimism now about the future of what he calls 'aesthetic literacy'. There was then, he says, 'a literary wedge in the culture'. He explains, 'There were probably 30 literary quarterlies in America at that time. The most famous were the Paris Review, the Kenyon Review and the Hudson Review - most of them are now out of business - but there were 15 or 20 more. So if you wrote a short story, you'd get a publisher. There was a truly literary culture, very small, but that culture's gone. There were people who read seriously, and their numbers were far greater than they are now. You can say, what's the difference if you have 50,000 or 20,000 readers?'</p> <p>In answer to the question, What is the difference? Roth tells the story of his friend, the Romanian writer Norman Manea. 'Under Ceausescu, Norman went to an older writer from the Party to complain about his readership. The man said, \"Norman, all a writer needs are eight readers. Think about it. Why do you need more than eight readers? That's enough. [Pause.] You, unfortunately, have only three,\"' Roth laughs. 'Well, we're down to three here, too.' More soberly, he rejects the contemporary evidence of literary striving as a sham, and has no patience with Creative Writing, which he thinks is a waste of time. 'American college students don't take expository writing, which they desperately need, but they take Creative Writing, which is like taking doodling.'</p> <p>Roth was never a doodler. There was always a moral seriousness to his work. But then he discovered the cost of exploring his Jewishness, and perhaps this is one source of the rage that permeates his work. In April 1959, another early story, 'Defender of the Faith', published in the New Yorker, so offended some Jewish readers with its suggestion that a Jewish soldier might exploit the Jewish sensitivities of his Jewish commanding officer to secure preferential treatment that the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith stepped in.</p> <p>Suddenly 'Philip Roth' was the subject of synagogue gossip and household arguments. His offence, which now seems impossibly arcane, was compounded the following year by the inclusion of the story in his debut volume, Goodbye Columbus. For much of the Sixties he was declared a traitor to his people, abused and denounced up and down as worse than anti-Semitic. 'I defended myself,' he recalls, 'but I was thrown by it, a big assault at 26. I could handle it, but I didn't like it.' </p> <p>Of course, this tribal brouhaha was nothing compared with the scandal of Portnoy's Complaint, which came out at the end of the Sixties. Portnoy's Complaint, which made him a celebrity, is an iconic book that changed everything, pitching him headlong into a world of banal public curiosity.</p> <p>Roth has often said he cannot identify any single experience from which Portnoy's Complaint originated. In early drafts it was 'The Jewboy'; then a play (workshopped by Dustin Hoffman); then 'Whacking Off'; then a short story, 'A Jewish Patient Begins His Analysis', and finally, with the appearance of his psychoanalyst, Portnoy's Complaint</p> <p>This 'wild blue shocker' (Life), a novel in the guise of a confession, was an immediate bestseller. Taken by hundreds of thousands of American readers as a confession in the guise of a novel, it placed its author inexorably centre stage in the minds of his audience. He's been there ever since.</p> <p>To my suggestion that he might have unconsciously courted outrage with Portnoy's Complaint, after his experience of the Jewish-American persecution complex, he replies carefully, 'I don't have any sense of audience, and least of all when I'm writing. The audience I'm writing for is me, and I'm so busy trying to figure the damn thing out, and having so much trouble, that the last thing I think of is: \"What is X, Y or Z going to be thinking of it?\"' Whatever the motivation, there was no going back. 'Literature got me into this,' says his character Peter Tarnopol in The Great American Novel, 'and literature is gonna have to get me out.'</p> <p>Perhaps writing literary fiction was hardly an ideal escape route, but it was what he knew. Roth's work in the early Seventies seemed to exhibit what one critic dubbed 'the perils of an over-literary mind'. After the wild comedy of Portnoy's Complaint, Roth experimented with satire (Our Gang), satirical fantasy (The Breast), the chaotic fantasies of The Great American Novel, and the 'miraculous mess' of My Life as a Man. Finally, he settled, in young middle age, into his exploration of the self, through Tarnopol, through Kepesh (The Professor of Desire) and eventually Zuckerman (The Ghost Writer and Zuckerman Unbound). This was the middle period of Roth's career, and it coincided with his relationship with Claire Bloom, who decided early on that she wanted 'to spend my life with this remarkable man'.</p> <p>When the British actress first met Roth in 1975, she says she found him 'daunting and flattering', but within a year they were lovers, and soon Bloom was visiting him here in Connecticut, becoming a kind of muse. The Professor of Desire (1977) is dedicated to her, and this mid-season ferment also yielded, among others, The Ghost Writer (1979), Zuckerman Unbound (1981) and The Counterlife (1986), one of his very finest and most original novels.</p> <p>By then, the Roth-Bloom liaison was so well-established on both sides of the Atlantic that he was spending half the year in London and had found a studio in Notting Hill. Despite an inevitable struggle with what he felt to be English anti-Semitism, he says he liked living in England. 'I met lots of people and made many friends, more friends than I had in New York, strangely; and I liked going back and forth.'</p> <p>The intimacy of Roth's connection to England is captured in Deception, a novel narrated entirely in dialogue, which imagines a literary man's affair with, among others, a middle-class English woman. The raw immediacy of this fiction, with its Rothian declaration that 'In my imagination I am unfaithful to everybody', provoked a crisis with Bloom, who writes in her memoir of this episode that, 'I no longer gave a damn whether these girlfriends were erotic fantasies. What left me speechless - though not for long - was that he would paint a picture of me as a jealous wife who is betrayed over and over again. I found the portrait nasty and insulting.'</p> <p>Almost simultaneously with this rift, Roth suffered a freak breakdown (induced by the Halcion prescribed after knee surgery) together with a new, and urgent, longing to come home. 'I began to feel less and less connected to America. I began to feel I was losing touch with American life. And so by 1989 I realised I couldn't do this any more. So I came back. It was a wonderful return home, because I rediscovered an old subject, which was this country, and I began to write those books about America. It was the best situation. I found a new subject which was an old subject that I knew. All the old stuff was fresh for me.' </p> <p>In 1993, there was a second renewal. He got divorced from Claire Bloom and entered the phase that has culminated in Exit Ghost and Indignation. 'Freedom, it's called,' he says, freighting the sentence with an almost tangible exhilaration. Now he was in the clear. He could come and go as he pleased. He could work where, how and whenever he chose, read as he pleased, and revel in the exploration of his many selves. So does he, I wondered, read his contemporaries?</p> <p>'No, I don't, and it's not out of principle. I don't read very much fiction any longer. If I'm going to read something I much prefer to read non-fiction. And I do; I read every night. I re-read. That's what I've been doing. Last month I was re-reading Camus. I haven't read The Plague in 40 years.' Recently he's also re-read Turgenev and Conrad. </p> <p>Which brings us to the re-reading of Roth himself. Portnoy's Complaint is still a recklessly funny tour de force, but a young man's book and a great comedy of its time. From his middle age, many novels of Roth's literary self-obsession do not weather well. They seem contrived, and rather lacking in humanity. At this point in the game, perhaps the best you can say is that he still harbours an ambition for simple greatness that has, thus far, seemed to slip through his fingers. </p> <p>Roth's prose, famously, displays the artifice of no artifice. On the page, he achieves a voice that's plain, natural and close to the everyday rhythms of speech. At its finest it is breathtaking, lean, sleek and muscular, a downhill racer, with a mesmerising momentum and demotic zest. Throughout his writing, he exhibits a deep admiration for two English writers, Shakespeare and George Orwell. It was Orwell who celebrated 'good prose' being 'like a window pane', and I think Roth's clarity derives in part from Orwell, whose great books, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, were published in the Forties, at an impressionable stage of Roth's adolescence.</p> <p>But when you try to approach this tetchy, isolated man through his books, the difficulties pile up. The lives in the novels, weighed down with 'the terrible ambiguity of the \"I\"', lack the simplicity of the prose. Rather, they hover in a no-man's-land between imagination and reality. This is because the author himself is elusive, indifferent and defensive towards vulgar efforts to locate him. Like many comic writers, he seems troubled, and especially by the attentions of the outside world. He prefers his solitary confinement, and his library.</p> <p>Enter Roth's world and you step into a hall of mirrors. Roth has done himself in so many different voices that, facing the title page of Indignation, 'books by Philip Roth', some 29, are now catalogued as 'Zuckerman' (eight titles, including The Anatomy Lesson), 'Roth' (five, including Operation Shylock and Deception), 'Kepesh' (three, including The Dying Animal, recently filmed as Elegy, starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), as well as 'Other' (10, including Portnoy's Complaint and Goodbye, Columbus.</p> <p>His preferred critic, Hermione Lee, gives the best account of this: 'Lives into stories, stories into lives: that's the name of Roth's double game.' The playfulness, if that's what it is, does not end there. Roth's highly contrived 'novelist's autobiography' The Facts opens with a letter to Nathan Zuckerman, his most celebrated alter ego, asking for his verdict on the book, and it ends with Zuckerman's 'reply': 'Dear Roth, I've read the manuscript twice. Here is the candour you ask for: Don't publish.' In addition to many, carefully scripted, interviews there is the memorable moment of awesome solipsism in Reading Myself and Others (1976) when Roth actually interviews himself! What on earth is going on? Critics have been driving themselves into paroxysms over this for decades. Is it authorial playfulness? A giant tease? Postmodernism run mad? Neurasthenic insecurity? Or the desperate strategies of a writer with insufficient material?</p> <p>Roth himself hates to be asked about his many alter egos. He speaks contemptuously of critics who get snared in the barbed wire of the Rothian no-man's-land, gunning them down with: 'Am I Roth or Zuckerman? It's all me... Nothing is me. I write fiction and I'm told it's autobiography; I write autobiography and I'm told it's fiction. So since I'm so dim and they're so smart, let them decide what it is or isn't.'</p> <p>Roth will always be defensive towards any attempt to link him to his protagonists. So when, rashly, I ask him if Marcus Messner is 'another of your alter egos?' he does not reply at once, and then responds coolly with, 'Ask me another way.' Finally, after a bit of sparring, he says, 'I'm not crazy about it [the alter ego]. It suggests a stand-in for me, when it's a character who grew out of the narration, and when none of those things happened to me. None of those things happened to me. It's imaginary.' As well as the continuing irritation about the alter ego question, however hard he tries to break new ground, there will always be disappointed readers harking back to 'the early work'.</p> <p>Christopher Hitchens, who has lived as a reader through every phase of Roth's writing and has also read Indignation, says he is enraged by the new book: 'There was a time when Roth was falsely accused of self-hatred by the elders of his own tribe (and defended from the charge by men of the calibre of Ralph Ellison). But to see him repeatedly fouling his own nest, and trying by vain repetitions like Exit Ghost to drag down the level of his previous work, and insulting us with Indignation is to wonder whether in some awful way he isn't trying to vindicate the original accusation, as well as to make his old age shame his youth.'</p> <p>What any critic says now will have little traction with Roth. He does not bother with reviews. 'I try to read as few as I can. It's not really very rewarding, except in a few instances, and it depends upon who's written it. If Frank Kermode reviewed my book I would read the review.'</p> <p>Novella, or novelette, or long short story, some of the material in Indignation is recycled from previous books. But if there is here an intimation of waning powers, there is also a new focus: a self that recognises the approach of the end, and another that looks back to the beginning. As well as reflecting on mortality, Indignation is about a young man's coming-of-age. </p> <p>'Coming and going, yes,' Roth replies, alluding to the death of his protagonist. 'I was trying to get away from writing about old men [Exit Ghost, Everyman, The Dying Animal]. I wanted to say I just don't want to think about that stuff any more. I have nothing fresh to say about it.' </p> <p>Was he, I wondered, not tempted to write a comedy to dispel the chill shadows of mortality? 'I would love to, but... [a beat] ...I don't think I know how to be comic any more.'</p> <p>Indignation argues against this. There's a comic set-piece at the heart of the narrative in which Marcus Messner gets a blow-job from his girlfriend. Roth acknowledges this, but seriously. 'What I wanted to do in this book is, through a little incident in this small place, depict sexual mores that have disappeared.'</p> <p>As our conversation turns to the, strictly speaking, fabulous experience of fellatio in the Fifties, we slide back to the world of Roth's youth, and he's talking about the books he read as an aspiring writer, 'sports books and adventure stories', Mark Twain, Theodore Dreiser and John Dos Passos. 'Every budding literary kid fell on Thomas Wolfe [Look Homeward, Angel] with a passion. There was this stream of rhetoric.' He begins to quote, happily. '\"O lost, and by the wind-grieved ghost, come back again...!\" Whatever that means.' A smile. 'Sounds good, though. As a kid, I wrote in the margin, \"Yes!\"'</p> <p>These half-remembered writers from the Twenties and Thirties haunt the Roth of Indignation. Even the name of his fictional midwestern town is taken directly from a collection of stories, Winesburg, Ohio, by Sherwood Anderson, a writer whose subject, like Roth's, is 'repression'. Roth's unconscious, inner dialogue with the American writers of the past is perhaps more revealing than he will allow. </p> <p>Curious, I turned up the opening pages of Anderson's 'book of grotesques', and found this passage, which stands almost as an epigraph to our conversation: 'Perfectly still he lay and his body was old and not of much use any more, but still something inside him was altogether young... It is absurd, you see, to try to tell what was inside the old writer as he lay on his high bed and listened to the fluttering of his heart. The thing to get at is what the writer, or the young thing within the writer, was thinking about.'</p> <p>When Roth published The Dying Animal in 2001, I asked him about his next book, and he replied, 'I hope it takes the rest of my life. I can't take starting from scratch.' But the experience of real life contradicts the writer's imaginative expectations. He's just finished another book - 'it's probably a novelette' - about another kind of death, a suicide. He insists this has 'no therapeutic value. I just find it's an interesting subject. I wanted to see if I could drive a character to that point where -' He stops. 'I'm trying to drive somebody crazy,' he summarises, with his usual deadpan delivery. </p> <p>So now he's looking for a new subject, and is once again in that dreadful limbo between books. 'Starting a new book is hell. You just flail around until something happens. It's miraculous. It comes to you out of nothing and nowhere. That's the problem with writing short books. You finish them too quickly. And that's what's wonderful about a long book. So I've decided I've got to find a big project that will take me right through to the end. Finish the day before, and - exit ghost.' </p> <p>The end of the tape comes with a 'click'. Our time is up. 'Would you like the tour?' he asks, slipping into a belated hostly ritual. When Roth stretches on his recliner, you see how painfully thin his legs have grown. We step out of the bug-free tent and stroll beneath a canopy of ancient oaks towards Roth's writing room, a well-appointed wooden summer house at the top of the garden. </p> <p>Inside, it's spartan but well-equipped, with the warm, comforting smell of wood. There are two desks - one for writing, one for 'business', a Roberts radio and a lectern where Roth, who has a bad back, likes to work standing up. On the mantelpiece over the empty fireplace ('I used to light a fire, but then I discovered I was spending all my time looking after it') there's a touching display of faded family photographs going back to the turn of the century. We inspect the sepia generations of Roths: his grandparents, his parents, his elder brother, and his younger self. There's a notable absence of wives or girlfriends, and almost the only outsider appears to be Saul Bellow, a lovely photo of his friend in his prime.</p> <p>Does he, I wonder, regret not having children? 'Well, I don't seem to go around regretting it, no. I was busy doing other things, you know, and then the opportunity slipped away because of age and the age of the women I was with.'</p> <p>He still likes to exercise. Most days, while it's warm, he'll swim in his pool at the bottom of the garden. Now, when summer ends, he will go back to New York City, and the familiar routine of dinners with friends and girlfriends.</p> <p>When the tour is over, he signs a copy of Indignation and we say goodbye. As I turn the car in the short driveway I see an old grey man walking slowly through the trees back to his studio for the inevitable rendezvous with his desk, a writer happily alone with his many selves, all passion spent.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To read more of Robert McCrum's brilliant interviews with literary giants, including Norman Mailer, VS Naipaul and Gore Vidal, go to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum\">theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum</a></p>",
  "<p>At the heart of London's Docklands, once a mouldering reminder of Britain's history as a great trading nation and now a gleaming glass and steel symbol of the might of global finance, the Canary Wharf offices of American investment bank Lehman Brothers - a name few people would have been aware of until a week ago - has suddenly become a stop on the tourist trail. A group of business people over from China on a training course have stopped to stare and have their photographs taken.</p> <p>'It is very shocking. We are here and it is very dramatic,' says a young woman among them, but she is interrupted by a Lehman security guard who charges over. 'You can't take photographs here, bloody gawpers!' he says. The group race off immediately, heads down, and the guard turns back muttering about their lack of respect for other people's misery.</p> <p>In New York, too, the 'gawpers' thronged to Lehman's headquarters in their hundreds to watch history unfold. On both sides of the Atlantic throughout the past tumultuous week, from Lehman's catastrophic collapse on Sunday night to US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's promise on Friday to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of American taxpayers' money to ride to the rescue of the banks, there was a profound sense of world-changing events unfolding at breakneck speed.</p> <p>Exuberant investors may have piled back into the stock markets on Friday, welcoming Paulson's mooted corporate aid package, but few believed anything would ever be the same again. Behind the anguished yells of disorientated City traders watching the markets oscillate from depression to mania and back again, and the macho insistence by Gordon Brown that he was in control of the crisis, something else was audible throughout - the sound of long-cherished truths being smashed to smithereens.</p> <p>Financiers in New York and London's Square Mile have enjoyed an extraordinary decade of global dominance, blowing unthinkable sums on yachts, racehorses and fine wines. Not only did they convince themselves of their own invincibility, but their glamour and sheer wealth blinded politicians into believing the alluring myths of the unfettered market.</p> <p>For Brown, who made it his mission from the early 1990s to woo London's money men, the reward for making sure regulators had a light touch and that taxes were low was a decade of turbo-charged growth, and the right to boast that the economic cycle of boom and bust was over.</p> <p>But while the banks were chalking up impressive profits, and driving growth, they were spoon-feeding Britain's consumers on a rich diet of cheap credit, which they gladly swallowed. The UK piled up the biggest debts in the G7 group of industrialised nations, sending up the price of homes from Cornwall to the Highlands of Scotland. Far from exercising Brown's cardinal virtue of prudence, consumers were saving less than at any time since the 1950s.</p> <p>The events of the past week may have played out among the larger-than-life characters of Wall Street, but on a smaller scale here at home they have finally slammed down the shutters on the era of cheap credit. For Britain's buy-now-pay-later, shop-till-you-drop economy, a mighty reckoning is now in store.</p> <p>For the staff of the investment bank Lehman Brothers, the reckoning came fast, last Monday morning. Glued to their BlackBerries all weekend for the latest news, they had pinned their hopes on a Sunday announcement of a government-brokered rescue, like the one Paulson clinched for Bear Stearns, then America's fifth-biggest investment bank, in March. But this time it was different. Dick Fuld, Lehman's abrasive chief, had stubbornly refused to countenance a series of offers to sell parts of his battered business, and Paulson thought he - and Wall Street - deserved to be taught a lesson.</p> <p>Lehman, he decided, must be left to sink or swim. 'He was effectively trying to identify \"insider money\" and \"outsider money\",' says Russell Jones, chief strategist at investment firm RBC Capital Markets. 'He was saying, \"Where an institution affects Main Street [outsider money], we'll save it; but where it only affects Wall Street [insider money], we won't\".'</p> <p>Barclays was one potential buyer for Lehman, and the head of Barclays Capital, Bob Diamond, flew out to New York to try to cut a deal. Paulson, however, refused to stump up any public cash to help rescue the 158-year-old institution - and the regulators back in London informed Diamond that they would need rock-solid assurances that bringing Lehman, with its billions of dollars of 'toxic' mortgage assets, under the wing of a British bank would not endanger the stability of the UK's financial system. Diamond walked away.</p> <p>Just before midnight on Sunday, its last chance exhausted, Fuld filed for bankruptcy, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious Wall Street dynasty - and rocking the financial world to its core.</p> <p>Back in London, where Chancellor Alistair Darling was in regular contact with Paulson, the prospect of such a high-profile casualty immediately set warning lights flashing. Lehman employed 5,000 staff in the UK at its swish Canary Wharf headquarters, whose jobs and livelihoods would be at risk; but Darling, and Financial Services Authority chairman Callum McCarthy knew that its collapse could ripple far beyond Docklands, to threaten the stability of Britain's entire banking system.</p> <p>Last Monday morning, as Lehman staff left Canary Wharf with boxes full of belongings, Darling held a fraught phone conference with McCarthy and Gordon Brown to discuss the risk that Lehman's collapse could so alarm investors that it would destabilise banks. Already, HBOS - which had tried and failed to raise \u00a34bn of cash from its shareholders in June - was in their sights. Later that day, Treasury officials, led by Darling's senior fixer Tom Scholar, began talking to HBOS about its future.</p> <p>Lloyds TSB, which had been hit less hard by the credit crunch than many of its rivals, first approached HBOS's ebullient boss, Andy Hornby, back in July. Despite the bungled fundraising, Hornby, once in charge of the George clothing range at Asda and a protege of retail millionaire and former Tory MP Archie Norman, was still determined he could go it alone.</p> <p>But the events of last Monday changed everything. As if Lehman's unseemly demise was not enough for the world's shocked investors to digest, Merrill Lynch, another mighty Wall Street broker brought low by rash bets on American mortgages, was swallowed up by its rival, Bank of America, in a hasty $50bn deal.</p> <p>Takeovers are hardly rare in banking; but for two such venerable Wall Street brands to disappear from the corporate jungle in a single day induced an alarming sense of vertigo among even the most hard-bitten investors.</p> <p>Economists call it 'contagion': the process by which the violent swings of mood caused by dramatic events in one financial market can rapidly spread around today's globalised world. From Moscow to Sydney, Paris to Beijing, investors dumped shares, wiping billions of dollars off the value of the world's companies, and poured cash into the traditional 'safe haven' asset of gold.</p> <p>On cable TV financial channel Bloomberg News on Monday night, usually the purveyor of bone-dry financial statistics, a ticker whizzed across the bottom of the screen that read 'Lehman staff clear desks, call headhunters, weep'.</p> <p>In the UK, all bank shares were pummelled, as investors began to think the unthinkable; but HBOS, long known to be woefully exposed to the shaky British property market, was most at risk. Its share price dropped by 18 per cent on Monday alone.</p> <p>That evening, Gordon Brown cornered Lloyds chairman Victor Blank at a party. Brown knew that if Lloyds was to succeed in rescuing HBOS, the government would have to throw its weight behind the deal by waiving competition rules.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, Darling, McCarthy and Bank of England governor Mervyn King gathered at Number 11 Downing Street to review the unfolding crisis; and decided HBOS directors must be told that 'soldiering on wouldn't do'. The sense of crisis was heightened later that same day, when Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, announced he would use $85bn (\u00a346bn) of public funds to make an emergency loan to the American insurer AIG, the world's biggest - and sponsor of Manchester United.</p> <p>Under its charismatic former boss Hank Greenberg, AIG had transformed itself from an old-fashioned insurer into a whizzy financial player with a spider's web of complex bets, and it was now facing massive losses as a result of the Lehman collapse.</p> <p>Bernanke, who forged his reputation as an economics professor studying the catalogue of mistakes that turned the Wall Street crash of 1929 into the decade-long Great Depression, feared that allowing AIG to follow Lehman into the bankruptcy courts would leave its clients throughout the banking world dangerously vulnerable, and put the health of the whole financial system at risk.</p> <p>In London, meanwhile, there was rising concern that if talks between Lloyds and HBOS were not concluded fast, savers would begin queuing outside Halifax branches to withdraw their savings. Already, other banks had begun to withdraw some of their funds, the first sign that a run on the bank could be in the offing.</p> <p>The humiliating run on Northern Rock a year ago is seared into the government's collective memory. It was the most public evidence of a government losing control of Britain's economy since Norman Lamont had to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury on what became known as Black Wednesday, in 1992, to announce the pound's unceremonious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism.</p> <p>After 'the run on the Rock', as it became known, Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, said that 'outside the movies, a run on a bank is something that happens in a banana republic. That one should have happened, under our noses, in a mature and prosperous country like the UK, is almost unimaginable.'</p> <p>Brown was determined not to allow another run on his watch. On Wednesday morning, the Financial Services Authority issued a statement insisting that HBOS was 'a well-capitalised bank that continues to fund its business in a satisfactory way'; but by then, Blank, together with his chief executive Eric Daniels, was close to finalising a deal with Hornby.</p> <p>By Wednesday night, the \u00a310bn deal was done, and the Halifax, well-known to savers for its cheerful ads starring Howard the singing bank clerk, and the 300-year-old Bank of Scotland had been trampled under the thundering hooves of Lloyds' black horse. The credit crunch, once a distant drama played out on Wall Street, had well and truly come home to Britain's shores.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, a shattered-looking Hornby joined Daniels at a press conference in London to reveal the details of the deal. US-born Daniels gleefully announced that he would create a 'great British bank,' and promised to slash at least 10 per cent of costs as a result of the merger, implying that at least a tenth of the combined 140,000 staff facethe threat of redundancy - a fact not lost on Alistair Darling, who represents many of them in his Edinburgh South West constituency.</p> <p>While the HBOS takeover allowed investors in Britain to catch their breath, in the US the fallout from Lehman's collapse was spreading. Speculation was mounting about the health of the only two independent Wall Street brokers left standing - Morgan Stanley and the mighty Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Morgan's boss John Mack, known as 'Mack the Knife' for his ruthless management style, was incandescent, complaining that speculators, in 'a market controlled by fear and rumour', were shorting Morgan's share price. But at the same time he began to talk to potential buyers, including the Chinese government, fearing Morgan might need to be rescued. There could hardly be a more potent illustration of the leaching of economic power east, from New York, to Beijing, Bangalore and Dubai, than these global titans scurrying to find a merger partner from China.</p> <p>On Thursday lunchtime in London's Bishopsgate, vendor Lorraine Cross, 57, was unlocking her news-stand, ready for the first edition of the Evening Standard. As the delivery of the first edition arrived, she pulled off the top sheet and exclaimed at the headline: 'God, look at this, Goldmans now!'</p> <p>A young American woman in a tan leather coat grabbed at the paper with trembling hands. 'That's my husband's firm, that's my husband,' she told Cross. She was led away by a friend, close to tears. 'Poor girl,' said Cross, 'but I have been here 36 years and I have been here for three lots of these big crises and it'll pick up again, it always does.'</p> <p>Her colleague Steve Jackson, 63, agreed. 'We've got no pensions and I had a letter the other day saying my endowment would be falling short and so I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for these flash boys playing with other people's lives just to buy their \u00a3400 bottles of wine and the rest.'</p> <p>For a group of builders taking a breather, it was clear that the effects of the financial meltdown would spread way beyond the Square Mile. 'It's bloody capitalism: the rich get richer and the rest of us pick up the pieces,' said Barry Solace, 38, from Greenwich. 'It's all negligence to have got into this state with so much money that they don't even know how to find it, never mind count it.' His colleague Ben Anderson nodded his head towards the building work behind them. 'It's a knock-on effect, isn't it? There were 10 contracts up in this area for building work and three have been cancelled. And when the work goes our jobs go, we're sacked, no pension, no big bonuses for us, nothing. It's always the same, the lower down the ladder you are, the worse off you are. The guys with the big bonuses might be losing a bit now, but they're already well set up.'</p> <p>Like the builders who have missed out on City contracts, some of the victims of last week's events are immediately visible: the hotdog sellers on Wall Street complaining about lack of business; the waitress in the champagne bar at Bishopsgate who raises an eyebrow when asked how many bottles of champagne she's sold. But there are many less visible victims, hit by the credit squeeze sucking funds back towards the embattled banks, as they scramble to get their finances in order.</p> <p>As the week went on, it became increasingly obvious that without more help one financial firm after another would fall victim to the vicious spiral of fear and greed that had brought down Lehman. So concerned did the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic become about the dizzy swings of the markets that they slapped a temporary ban on the short-selling of financial stocks, to prevent the share prices of any more banks falling off a cliff.</p> <p>And on Friday morning, Paulson finally went for the nuclear option, unveiling an audacious plan for Washington to spend 'hundreds of billions of dollars' of taxpayers' money on buying up the hard-to-value assets held by US banks, gathering them into a so-called 'bad bank', freeing their erstwhile owners to get back to business usual. The markets reacted jubilantly - in London, the FTSE 100 made its biggest ever one-day gain.</p> <p>Spending public cash to rescue the banks will be hugely controversial, and could leave America's taxpayers with hefty bills for years to come. But on Friday Paulson declared: 'I am convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative - a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets unable to fund economic expansion.'</p> <p>And it's that great fear which has been at the hub of politicians' concerns throughout this crisis: how will the struggles of the banks hit Main Street - or Acacia Avenue?</p> <p>Long after the dust has settled on the past seven nerve-shredding days, the economic hangover from the credit boom will still be felt. Already, house prices in the UK have fallen by 10 per cent, economic growth has stalled and more than 100,000 jobs have been lost. But most analysts believe that we are slipping into at least a year of sickly economic growth, and it may be 2010 before any signs of a genuine recovery are visible.</p> <p>The US has already been in the grip of a housing crash for more than two years; but while prices continue to fall, and a growing number of poor homeowners default on their loans, the value of the complex mortgage-backed assets in banks' portfolios has continued to plummet. Banks have responded by tightening the loan taps in an effort to get their finances back in order; which in turn makes it harder to get a new mortgage, and accelerates the fall in house prices, which have already dropped by close to 20 per cent.</p> <p>Paulson and Bernanke hope last week's dramatic intervention will finally act as a circuit-breaker in this pernicious financial storm, which has already brought down some of Wall Street's biggest names - and swept thousands of the poorest Americans out of their homes. British banks will not be able to offload their toxic assets into Paulson's new 'bad bank', but the government hopes that the US moves will at least restore a sense of calm. 'It should draw most of the poison out of the system,' said one regulator this weekend.</p> <p>For the time being at least, Gordon Brown may just have become that rare commodity, a Prime Minister actually saved - rather than destroyed - by an economic catastrophe.</p> <p>When the resignation of Scottish minister David Cairns, with his potentially devastating admission that he could not in all conscience pretend he thought Brown could win an election, was relegated to the inside pages of Wednesday's newspapers by turmoil in the markets it became clear to Labour rebels that now was not the time to rise up against their leader.</p> <p>One minister who shares their despair at the government's plight said none the less that the City crisis had now made a truce essential: 'It's not that people will say, \"Gordon's the best man to deal with this\", because the public perception is that he was the Chancellor and completely identified with the economic policies that have got us here. It's that we will not look credible or responsible if while this such a crisis is ensuing we are engaging in internal warfare.'</p> <p>Labour MPs are already clamouring for a root-and-branch review of City regulation, further clampdowns on what the SNP leader Alex Salmond called the 'spivs and speculators' bringing banks to their knees, even curbs on City bonuses to limit risky activity - a call endorsed by none other than Labour chairman Harriet Harman, who made fat-cat pay part of her campaign for the deputy leadership on Friday.</p> <p>The Chancellor, who will address the party conference tomorrow, is under pressure to respond, and Treasury officials are hurriedly drawing up plans for a radical overhaul of financial regulation.</p> <p>But John McFall, the Labour chairman of the Commons Treasury select committee, warned that ministers should concentrate on sorting out the current crisis rather than being panicked into responding. 'I think there has to be a post mortem. The primary task is to get the financial community out of the gigantic hole into which they have put themselves. That is hugely important, and then after that is achieved we can have time to look at what undoubtedly needs to change.'</p> <p>The Tories' traditionally deregulatory instincts, meanwhile, have been shaken by the new political reality of millions of swing voters in Middle England angrily contemplating the wreckage of their pensions, share portfolios and - in some cases - careers. They are in no mood to hear, as the former Bank governor Eddie George suggested in a pamphlet for the Tory think-tank Politeia last week, that the City itself is better placed than the government to sort out its problems.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne is demanding new powers for the Bank of England to intervene in the markets and greater protection for savers, to prevent panicking customers staging runs on another bank.</p> <p>The Conservative backbencher John Redwood, a former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild and chair of David Cameron's economic competitiveness review, said it was time to restore the Bank of England's powers of oversight. 'The banks have managed to evolve a system that allows them to lend more in good times and stop lending in bad times. There's an overall answer, and that's more intelligent central banking that keeps the banks shorter of money in good times.</p> <p>The role of the Bank of England - and the Federal Reserve when under the control of former chairman Alan Greenspan - in fomenting the credit crisis is coming under fierce scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic. When both slashed interest rates to cushion their economies against recession after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, the stage was set for an extraordinary credit binge.</p> <p>Jim O'Neill, chief global strategist at Goldman Sachs, says: 'Alan Greenspan ran too easy a monetary policy. I think already, one year on, the right questions are being asked: why were US real interest rates so low, for so long?'</p> <p>With Greenspan keeping the cheap money flowing, the banks became increasingly creative. Not content with the old-fashioned banker's job of taking in savers' deposits, and handing them out to worthy borrowers, they devised ever more ingenious methods of channelling billions of dollars of investors' cash, much of it from overseas, into high-risk loans to unsuspecting members of the public.</p> <p>Now the American banks are paying the ultimate price for this frenzied bout of 'financial innovation,' as they and their political backers called it - the promise of much harsher scrutiny; and the worst humiliation of all, nationalisation.</p> <p>The very financial masterminds who have spent the past decade urging governments to set free the 'wealth creators' and safeguard their 'competitiveness' have been brought under the control of Washington. And the government most associated with free-market capitalism and suspicion of state intervention has been forced to undertake the most costly nationalisation programme in living memory.</p> <p>In the US, Republican presidential candidate John McCain has criticised what he called 'failed regulation, reckless management and a casino culture on Wall Street', and called for the sacking of Christopher Cox, the chairman of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>Paulson may be promising that no expense will be spared as he rides to the rescue of America's bombed-out financial sector; but the quid pro quo is likely to be a large helping of humble pie.</p> <p>O'Neill, at Goldman, which itself came under fire last week, says Paulson has deliberately held the banks' feet to the fire. 'They were quite happy to see all of us in the private sector shaken up. If you look at what evolved with the unfolding of Lehman, we all have to think about the quality of the model we have got. While it feels traumatic, it doesn't half focus the mind.'</p> <p>Shaun Springer, chief executive of Napier Scott , the financial headhunter based in the City, said he was hoping to pick up a bit of business over the next few weeks as staff at Lehman and other troubled banks looked for new berths; but he knows that the golden age of the City is over.</p> <p>'What we are living through now will reverberate through the rest of the century in the same way the Great Depression did last century. We are witnessing a very real power shift. Money is moving eastwards - while they're creating wealth, we're losing it hand over fist. Where it ends no one knows.</p> <p>'London has enjoyed an unprecedented decade of global dominance. Let's hope people took lots of photos to look back on in the years to come'.</p>",
  "<p>A huge explosion ripped through part of a luxury hotel in Pakistan's capital Islamabad yesterday, killing scores of people and injuring many more. The death toll may reach into the hundreds.</p> <p>The blast, one of the biggest seen in Pakistan in recent years, happened at the Marriott hotel at around 8pm. The hotel was left burning fiercely all along its fa\u00e7ade, with fears that it could totally collapse while other buildings in the vicinity were also left damaged.</p> <p>Scores of bodies were being brought out of the flaming building as rescue workers battled the blaze in scenes of chaos. At least four Britons were injured in the attack, two of them children. Both sustained superficial injuries and were discharged from hospital last night while the two adults remained in hospital overnight for observation.</p> <p>The Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, condemned the strike as 'yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification'. He said such a 'brutal act of terror deserves the condemnation of the entire international community' and added that the British government would continue 'to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government of Pakistan against the violent extremists who have no answers, but only offer death and mayhem.'</p> <p>Witnesses said that security staff at the front of the hotel, where the blast was strongest, had 'simply been vaporised.' Hotel staff said that all the Marriott's function rooms, including the large ballroom, had been hired for iftar - the traditional communal meal that breaks the day-long fast that Muslims observe during the holy month of Ramadan. According to the hotel owner, at least 700 people would have been in the hotel at the time of the blast at 8pm. Around 300 eating under a marquee at the back of the hotel away from the blast survived.</p> <p>Senior police official Asghar Raza Gardezi said the explosion, one of the biggest such attacks in Pakistan for over a decade, was caused by more than a tonne of explosives probably delivered in a small truck. Other reports indicated a series of bombs - possibly one small explosion which paved the way for other larger blasts.</p> <p>Imtiaz Gul, a journalist, was dining with friends in the marquee when the attack happened. 'First there was a blast and then all the electricity went out ... then it came back on and there was a second much bigger blast or a series of deafening blasts,' he said.</p> <p>'We found our way out but it was really harrowing. It was carnage, there was debris everywhere, body parts, glass. At the front of the hotel there were not even body parts. The blast had just destroyed everything.'</p> <p>Other witnesses spoke of corpses strewn on the ground. Scores of ambulances rushed to the scene, negotiating burnt-out vehicles and a vast crater left by the explosion. Windows in buildings nearly a mile away in residential areas and a heavily guarded compound where ministers have their official homes were damaged.</p> <p>The Marriott is in the centre of the city, close to the National Assembly, the main commercial thoroughfare and the national television headquarters. Security has been high at the hotel since a previous attempted suicide bombing in 2007, foiled by a security guard.</p> <p>A US State department official using a section of white pipe as a walking stick was seen leading three colleagues through the rubble from the charred building, one of them bleeding heavily from a wound on the side of his head.</p> <p>One of the four, who identified himself only as Tony, said they had begun moving towards the rear of the hotel's Chinese restaurant after the first blast when the second threw them against the back wall. 'Then we saw a big truck coming through the gates,' he said. 'After that it was just smoke and darkness.'</p> <p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, though radical militants allied with the Afghan Taliban and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda who are engaged in a violent insurgency in Pakistan will be the prime suspects.</p> <p>The use of multiple truck bombs is a favoured technique of Islamic militants. A security guard at the scene said he saw a large vehicle that caught fire on its front before suddenly exploding.</p> <p>Pakistan, a key US ally in the war on terror, has faced a wave of militant violence in recent weeks following offensives by its army against insurgents in the restive regions along its frontier with Afghanistan. Though the capital has avoided most of the bloodshed, hundreds have died in a series of bombings and suicide attacks in the last six months. Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, was killed in December in a bomb and shooting attack and there have been strikes in most major cities. Earlier this month the convoy of the prime minister was shot at.</p> <p>Hours before the blast yesterday Pakistan's newly elected president, Bhutto's widower Asif Ali Zardari, gave a speech to Parliament. He pledged Pakistan's support in the international fight against terrorism, continuing the policy of his predecessor in the post, General Pervez Musharraf.</p> <p>President Zardari and Prime Minister Gilani strongly condemned last night's attack in a joint statement.</p> <p>'This is terrorism and we have to fight it together as a nation,' Rehman Malik, the head of Pakistan's Interior Ministry, told reporters at a hospital treating the wounded.</p>",
  "<p>They may be revered by India's Hindus, but the thousands of cows that roam the streets of Delhi have now been targeted by exasperated judges, who have condemned the city council for allowing the city's bovine population to spiral out of control.</p> <p>Hitting one can land a driver in jail for a year, but the cows' erratic behaviour can pose a more immediate road hazard. Last week the High Court in Delhi ordered the city authorities to pay a widow \u00a32,500 compensation after her husband was thrown from his motorbike and killed while swerving to avoid one of the animals.</p> <p>The High Court laid the blame for the scale of the problem on the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, accusing it of being 'careless and negligent' in its duty to clear the streets and ordering it to redouble its efforts.</p> <p>Although the capital's cow catchers have rounded up about 19,000 strays in the past year, more are arriving every day, brought in by agricultural workers who come to the city looking for work. They find a ready market for their milk at the estimated 2,300 illegal dairies in the city. </p> <p>While the courts take a dim view of what one Indian paper dubbed the 'moo menace', cows retain a special place in Hindu culture. In the Sewa Nagar area of south Delhi last week several were wandering freely on a road in a small, rubbish-strewn valley where their owners live in ramshackle shelters. While traffic swerved to avoid a collision and drivers hooted their horns, a motorcyclist pulled up next to the central reservation, rummaged in his jacket, pulled out a bag of vegetable peelings and strewed them in front of a large white cow on the opposite side of the road.</p> <p>Watching was Vijay Gutam, 20, who said he looked after 25 cows. The family had moved with their animals from Uttar Pradesh in search of work, selling the milk from their animals to a local dairy. </p> <p>'No one has told us not to let them go onto the roads,' he said. 'We have to let them go out, so they can eat the grass and food off the streets. There is nothing for them down here,' he said, gesturing to the mud bath to which the animals returned at night. 'If someone complains, we fetch the cow and bring it back.'</p> <p>The corporation would like the dairies to move to an area it has set aside on the edge of the city, but moving the beasts is not easy. If a cow is caught, it is sold at auction but the owner receives no compensation, so the cow catchers are regularly attacked as they go about their work.</p> <p>The courts have repeatedly ordered the corporation to clear the streets, but in private officials admit they are a long way from getting the problem under control. Their request for dozens of armed police officers to assist in the round-up fell on deaf ears and a plan to involve the army failed. </p> <p>They have tried microchipping animals in the hope of keeping track of their owners, but many of the urban farmers have removed the devices. </p> <p>By the time the latest court deadline for action passed on 31 August, there were still an estimated 30,000 cows at large in Delhi.</p>",
  "<p>Thabo Mbeki's ousting was painted yesterday by African National Congress secretary-general Gwede Mantashe as a means to salvage unity in the ruling party. But his removal has everything to do with political score-settling aimed at clearing the name of Jacob Zuma, the presumed next President of South Africa after elections next year.</p> <p>Opposition leader Helen Zille said the move 'has nothing to do with unity and everything to do with Zuma's people now getting their hands on, and suppressing, paperwork detailing 783 bribes totalling 4.2m rands (\u00a3275,000)', allegedly paid between 1999 and 2005 when Mbeki sacked Zuma as deputy president. But Mbeki's departure is no surprise. His presidential post has been under threat ever since December last year when the ANC conference in Polokwane humiliatingly elected Zuma to the ANC presidency. He should have resigned then, rather than wait for Judge Chris Nicholson - in his judgment 10 days ago over the credibility of the Zuma case - to imply that Mbeki had interfered with the judiciary to nail his old rival.</p> <p>In the end Mbeki, the past master of co-option who since succeeding Nelson Mandela in 1999 has brought old apartheid foes into line, cut a lonely figure as his destiny was sealed. The assertion by Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka that she would resign in solidarity had no impact. What the Zuma camp is believed to have obtained - during a week of furious behind-the-scenes negotiations - is a pledge from Finance Minister Trevor Manuel that he would stay on. Highly regarded internationally, Manuel is the rambunctious Zuma camp's ticket to international credibility.</p> <p>At home it is easy to confuse the will of ordinary South Africans - millions of whom have not had a taste of the country's annual 4 per cent growth rate in Mbeki's nine years - with the vengeful offensive of the Zuma camp, personified by ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, who ever since the Polokwane conference has been pledging to 'kill' and 'crush' in Zuma's name. Malema frightens people, and it will be an early test of Zuma's political credibility if he manages to shed him now.</p> <p>Mbeki, the black Englishman with sharp intellect and Machiavellian tendencies, has impressed abroad more than at home. He devised the African Renaissance, put Africa on the G8 agenda and oversaw the creation of the African Union. Like the late, great Prime Minister Jan Smuts - who established the League of Nations but was unpopular domestically - Mbeki revels in international diplomacy, though the jury is still out on his work for Zimbabwe. While Mbeki was seeming to fly the flag for South Africa, he was denying the link between HIV and Aids at home. Thousands died while the government until four years ago blocked free access to anti-retrovirals even as drug prices were dropping. His seeming determination to be 'in denial' over South Africa's rampant crime problem may also have claimed lives.</p> <p>Mbeki, always aloof and uncomfortable on the hustings, never connected with the ANC's grassroots. He neglected the party, whose left-wing alliance partners - the South African Communist party and the Cosatu trade union movement - picked up the pieces and shored up Zuma's revenge.</p> <p>At provincial level, the disarray has grown into infighting. Almost every week, at local party meetings, militants come to blows or are killed. The control of resources and patronage has trumped political ideology. </p> <p>Mbeki loyalists - those who remain - suggest that Zuma's camp is the one that operates on patronage. But there is also evidence of the reverse. Mbeki has made a career out of co-opting his rivals or, failing that, of drumming them out of politics. He succeeded in 2001 with Tokyo Sexwale and Cyril Ramaphosa after accusing them of plotting to depose him. But sacking the stubborn, self-made and populist Zuma over corruption allegations in 2005 turned out to be his worst mistake. The arms deal scandal left Zuma tainted, but Mbeki is tarred too.</p>",
  "<p>There is some formidable construction work taking place at Worcester. The renovation of Sixways stadium isn't finished yet, but the imposing new Slick Systems Stand was opened to the public for the first time yesterday. </p> <p>It meant that this match, the first home fixture of the season, drew the largest crowd in the club's history. As the corporate boxes have not been completed, Worcester will break that attendance record again before the season is much older. </p> <p>Vitally there is a real sense that the club are building something equally impressive on the pitch, with Chris Latham adding considerable presence to what were already solid foundations. After a dour, hesitant opening quarter in which Toby Flood and Loki Crichton traded equally wayward penalty kicks, Worcester began to assert themselves, buoyed by Leicester's lack of menace. </p> <p>The ferocious tackling of Netani Talei in midfield and new full-back Sam Tuitupou stymied Leicester's attacks. One especially ferocious hit, on a charging Martin Corry, typified Worcester's resolution. This was the home debut for the No 15 many regard as the finest in the world and the Worcester crowd were kitted out with dangling cork hats and Australian jerseys in celebration of his arrival. </p> <p>Leicester's efforts to control the play were hindered by two further penalty misses by Flood. When Matt Mullan broke free from the morass of bodies and charged over the line Worcester looked thoroughly in control. Leicester, though, are not so easily beaten. At the very point when Worcester should have killed the game off, taking advantage of Jordan Crane's yellow card, Flood found his range and put them two points in front with a pair of penalty goals. </p> <p>Crane's return kick-started an enthralling 30 minutes of rugby, with the lead switching back and forth. Talei sliced through the middle of Leicester's defence and sprinted clean through to the try line, roared onwards with thunderous enthusiasm by the crowd.</p> <p>Crichton converted and Worcester had a five-point lead before Flood cut three points with another penalty. </p> <p>When James Collins was shown a yellow card for a dangerous tackle with 23 minutes to play, Worcester stirred themselves to greater efforts. Latham burst out of his own 22, sprinting 60 metres downfield before he was hauled down by Flood who earned himself 10 minutes on the sidelines for a foul in the process. </p> <p>Crichton kicked the ensuing penalty and Worcester's lead was again five points. With Flood off the field it should have been enough, but it was not. Leicester pushed up, putting severe pressure on the Worcester line. Julien Dupuy, making his first start for the visitors, finally found a gap and squirmed through, throwing himself over the line with a flourish. He added the conversion and put Leicester two points up once more. </p> <p>From there Leicester ran down the remaining minutes, frustrating Worcester and their fans with a series of drives. With four minutes to play Worcester did win a penalty, but Matthew Jones pushed it just wide.</p>",
  "<h2>Baked mackerel with pine nuts and rosemary</h2> <p>Mackerel, cheap and plentiful, benefits from bold seasonings. Here, the fish is matched with olives, pine kernels and golden raisins. Check the fish carefully for any stray bones. </p> <p>Serves 3</p> <p><strong>mackerel - 3, filleted</strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil</strong></p> <p>For the topping:</p> <p><strong>a large shallot</strong></p> <p><strong>a clove of garlic, finely chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>fresh white breadcrumbs - 60g</strong></p> <p><strong>black olives, stoned - 15</strong></p> <p><strong>pine nuts - 50g</strong></p> <p><strong>juice and finely grated zest of a lemon</strong></p> <p><strong>raisins - 2 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>a small handful of chopped parsley</strong></p> <p><strong>leaves from a couple of bushy sprigs of </strong></p> <p><strong>rosemary, chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>capers - 2 tsp </strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 190C/Gas 5. Rinse the mackerel, pat them dry with kitchen paper and lay them snugly in a roasting tin. Peel the shallot and chop it finely, then let it cook slowly with a tablespoon or so of the olive oil and the garlic in a small pan till soft and translucent. Add the breadcrumbs and let them colour slightly. Chop the olives and add them to the crumbs with the pine nuts, lemon zest, raisins and chopped herbs and capers. Season with salt and pepper. </p> <p>Scatter the crumb mixture over the fish. Squeeze over the lemon juice and add a drizzle of olive oil then bake for 15-20 minutes till the fish is opaque and comes easily from the bone. </p> <h2>Sea bass with lemon &amp; anchovy potatoes </h2> <p>Line-caught sea bass is not difficult to find. That from Cornwall, which has been very good recently, is helpfully tagged through the gills. I reckon on a 1 kg bass being enough for two. </p> <p>Serves 2</p> <p>For the fish:</p> <p><strong>a whole sea bass, cleaned but left on the bone</strong></p> <p><strong>a little dried or fresh oregano</strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil</strong></p> <p>For the potatoes:</p> <p><strong>waxy-fleshed potatoes such as Anya or Pink Fir Apple - 500g</strong></p> <p><strong>olive oil - 4 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>a large lemon</strong></p> <p><strong>anchovy fillets - 12</strong></p> <p><strong>vegetable stock - 250ml</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 200C/Gas 6. Slice each potato three or four times. If you do this lengthways you will end up with long, elegant pieces. Warm a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a roasting tin over a moderately hot flame, then put the potatoes in and let them colour on both sides. They cook best if you leave them alone for several minutes in between stirring. You want them to be pale gold on both sides. </p> <p>Cut the lemon in half, then into thick segments. Add the anchovies, and a grinding of black pepper and then pour over the stock. </p> <p>Lay the fish on top of the potatoes, brush with a little olive oil then add the herbs and a mild seasoning of salt and black pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the flesh will slide easily away from the bone in big juicy pieces. This will take a matter of 25-30 minutes. </p> <p>Serve the fish with the potatoes and spoon over the stock. </p> <h2>Clams with cider and cream</h2> <p>I don't usually go in for creamy main courses, but there is a certain magic that happens when you mix shellfish, cider and the finest double cream. You will need a good baguette to go with this. </p> <p>Serves 2</p> <p><strong>clams - 600g in their shells</strong></p> <p><strong>a medium sized shallot (or two little ones)</strong></p> <p><strong>butter - 15g </strong></p> <p><strong>medium dry cider - 350ml</strong></p> <p><strong>double cream - 4 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>a good handful of chopped parsley</strong></p> <p><strong>crusty bread or baguette, to serve</strong></p> <p>Put two large soup bowls aside to get warm. Scrub the clams, checking thoroughly for any dead or broken ones. Peel and finely chop the shallot, then put it into a large, deep pan with the butter over a low heat. Let the shallot soften, stirring it regularly so it doesn't colour. When soft and translucent pour in the cider, let it bubble up for a few minutes so that it reduces by about half, then add the cleaned clams. Cover tightly with a lid and turn the heat to medium.</p> <p>Cook for two minutes till the shells have opened. Lift the clams out with a draining spoon into two warm bowls and cover. Turn up the heat, pour in the cream, add the parsley, stir and season gently with black pepper. Let it bubble for a minute or so. Taste the sauce, and in the unlikely event of it needing salt, add a very little. </p> <p>Pour the sauce over the clams and serve immediately with some crusty bread or baguette, and a spoon for the cider sauce. </p> <h2>Grilled mussels with thyme and parmesan </h2> <p>Mussels are cheap, sustainable (look out for hand-gathered and farmed) and curiously filling. When I feel I have had enough of chucking them in a pot with a glass of white wine and some tarragon then I grill them under a coating of buttery breadcrumbs. </p> <p>Enough for 2</p> <p><strong>24 large mussels</strong></p> <p><strong>a glass of white wine </strong></p> <p>For the herb butter:</p> <p><strong>butter - 120g</strong></p> <p><strong>parsley - 4 bushy sprigs</strong></p> <p><strong>thyme leaves - 2 good tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>a clove of garlic</strong></p> <p><strong>a medium-sized hot chilli</strong></p> <p><strong>a little lemon juice</strong></p> <p><strong>white breadcrumbs - 5 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>grated parmesan - 3 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Put the butter in a mixing bowl. Finely chop the parsley leaves, thyme, garlic and seeded chilli. Mash into the butter with the lemon juice, crumbs and parmesan. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> <p>Put the prepared mussels (thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed, and checked for broken or dead ones) into a deep pan over a moderate heat, pour in the white wine then cover tightly with a lid. Let them steam for a minute or two until their shells open.</p> <p>Lift the mussels out of the pan, pulling off the top shells as you go. Lay the mussels in the bottom shells flat on a baking sheet or oven-proof tray. Spread a teaspoon or so of the butter over each mussel then cook under a preheated grill till bubbling. </p> <h2>Chilled crab and cucumber soup</h2> <p>Crab soup is often a Saturday lunch dish in our house, together with rounds of hot, brown toast. Sometimes, I prefer a cold version, its richness nicely balanced with yoghurt and the cooling notes of cucumber. </p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>a large cucumber</strong></p> <p><strong>sea salt</strong></p> <p><strong>a small clove of garlic</strong></p> <p><strong>a small red chilli</strong></p> <p><strong>natural yoghurt - 500ml</strong></p> <p><strong>wine vinegar - 1 tbs</strong></p> <p><strong>a small bunch of mint - to give about 4 tbs chopped leaves</strong></p> <p><strong>single cream - 100ml</strong></p> <p><strong>a few sprigs of parsley</strong></p> <p><strong>white and brown crab meat - 8 heaped tbs</strong></p> <p>Peel the cucumber, halve it, scrape out the seeds with a teaspoon then chop into very small dice. Tip the cucumber into a colander, sprinkle liberally with a teaspoonful of salt, toss gently then leave in the sink for a good half hour. </p> <p>Peel and very finely crush the garlic and add to the yoghurt. Seed and very finely chop the chilli then mix into the yoghurt with the vinegar. Remove the leaves from the mint and chop them finely - you will need about 4 lightly heaped tablespoons - then stir them into the soup. </p> <p>Stir in the cucumber, but not the liquid that has drained from it, and then the cream. Season with black pepper and chill thoroughly in the fridge. It must be really cold if it is to be good. Chop the parsley leaves and mix with the crab, adding a little black pepper as you go. </p> <p>To serve, divide the soup between four soup bowls. Place two heaped tablespoons of crab meat into the centre of each bowl and serve immediately.</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood began sending itself up before the 'Hollywoodland' sign needed its second coat of paint, and indeed on his first visit to Los Angeles in the early 1920s the newly lionised young Scott Fitzgerald told Tinseltown's old lion DW Griffith that the best subject for the movies was cinema itself. Ben Stiller apparently had the idea for the latest of such movies while appearing in Spielberg's Second World War film Empire of the Sun 20 years ago and now has the power to realise it. His film Tropic Thunder, which he co-scripted with Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux, is a consistently amusing, sporadically hilarious, occasionally inspired comedy that sets out to expose the greed, stupidity and false values of Hollywood but sprays its targets as randomly as the machine-gun that runs out of control in The Wild Bunch.</p> <p>It begins with advertisements for the (non-existent) energy drink and chocolate bar that are subjects of product placement in a movie called 'Tropic Thunder'. Then there are trailers for new pictures featuring its three egocentric stars. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) appears as a Rambo-style actor in the trailer for 'Scorchers VI: Global Meltdown'. Then there's Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) in a vulgar comedy of the sort in which Eddie Murphy has multiple roles as farting grotesques. The third trailer is for a deeply serious, infinitely sensitive drama starring the Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) as a gay monk guiltily attracted to a fellow cleric. Fake trailers are not new. They figure in the middle of Stanley Donen's Movie Movie and the Tarantino-Rodriguez double-bill Grindhouse, though my favourite is the one in John Landis's The Kentucky Fried Movie for a Corman-style exploitation flick called 'Catholic High School Girls in Trouble.' But Stiller's ones are well done, and nicely set up the actors who are later to be seen in a TV showbusiness programme talking pretentiously about their current project and artistic problems.</p> <p>Then comes the movie, a parody of a realistic action flick with spurting blood and overflowing guts in the Private Ryan manner, which reconstructs a suicidal US rescue mission in 1969 Vietnam based on a book by the only survivor of the assault force, 'Four-Leaf' Tayback (Nick Nolte), a grizzled veteran who lost both hands in the incident. Speedman is playing the screen's version of 'Four Leaf' while the white Lazarus (an astonishing performance from Downey) is playing a black sergeant from the Deep South, and has lost himself in the character. Shooting in a remote corner of Vietnam and directed by a British filmmaker (Steve Coogan) incapable of handling the outrageous American stars, the film is a month behind schedule after five days' shooting. Back in Los Angeles a crazy, foul-mouthed producer, Les Grossman, alternately grimly menacing and warmly confidential, threatens to close the film and ruin everyone's career. Brilliantly played by a carefully disguised major star, Grossman is said to be modelled on a well-known Hollywood tycoon.</p> <p>So how is the movie-within-the-movie to be saved? The answer is by using the method of guerrilla cinema advocated by John Milius, who thought up Apocalypse Now while the Vietnam war was at its height. He wanted to take the actors to Nam and shoot the film with hand-held cameras in the combat zone. This is what the real 'Four-Leaf' Tayback suggests to the manic British director, and they set out to dump the five leads in the jungle: the three stars, plus two ambitious young minor actors, an African-American called Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), who mocks the 'white negro' Lazarus, and the eager-beaver middle-American Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). The director has a cellphone to shoot close-ups, other cameras are to be concealed here and there, and a crazy explosives expert has set up a variety of devices to simulate enemy attacks. However, things go haywire. There are mines left from the French war in Indo-China of half-a-century ago, and the actors find themselves up against an enemy as ruthless as the Viet Cong in the form of native drug dealers ensconced in a jungle fortress. </p> <p>Real warfare ensues and the film goes off in several different directions. At one level it remains comic and satirical. There are jokes about the drug-addicted Jeff Portnoy trying to go cold turkey and becoming entranced by a mound of cocaine that resembles the mountain in Close Encounters, and Stiller is mocked for playing the mentally retarded hero of 'Simple Jack', a film that like Rain Man and Forrest Gump sits up and begs for an Oscar. At another level it resembles a gung-ho war movie and is photographed by John Toll who shot Braveheart and The Thin Red Line. At its most interesting, however, it takes up ideas of fiction and reality, acting and being. In Jean Genet's play The Balcony the pathetic patrons of a brothel in a police state, who are acting out their sexual fantasies as a bishop, a judge and general, are forced to assume these roles in public when a revolution breaks out and a real bishop, judge and general are killed. In 1968, Haskell Wexler wrote, photographed and directed Medium Cool, in which a TV journalist covers the tumultuous Democratic Convention in Chicago. Suddenly on the soundtrack someone shouts, 'Look out Haskell, it's real', and indeed, Wexler and his actors were in the middle of a real riot with Mayor Daley's cops tear-gassing the crowd. </p> <p>Stiller and Co toy with these resonant notions rather than examining them, but the rich confusion of themes and aims saves the film from being merely a series of spoofs and sketches like Airplane and Naked Gun. Yet with its Oscar-night coda, the film is ultimately an affectionate celebration of Hollywood values rather than something truly subversive like Sunset Boulevard.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Metallica</strong> <br>O2 Arena, London SE10</p> <p>Think of an intimate, fan-club-only album launch party, and you might picture a cramped club with sweat raining off the low ceiling on to the lucky few. Not so with Metallica, 27-year-old Danish-Californian rock monoliths. Their fan club easily fills the O2 Arena. When the band arrive on stage, 20,000 people begin roaring and barely let up for two hours. </p> <p>By this gargantuan band's touring standards, this gig is actually a radically scaled-back affair. Billed as a party in honour of the release of their No 1 album Death Magnetic, this show has no stage set, save a spine of amps; few theatrics, no video screens, or any of the pyrotechnics that traditionally light up Metallica shows. When I saw them at Earls Court in 1996, by contrast, stunt men on fire ran amok and the stage pretended to collapse. Tonight, singing guitarist James Hetfield struts about on the amps; lead guitarist Kirk Hammett does too. That's about it. When, midway through a closing 'Seek and Destroy', the band unleash their only bit of stagecraft - dozens of giant black Metallica beach balls - the delight is universal.</p> <p>Metallica have done many fan-club shows before, but this one feels like a particularly chummy love-in at a pivotal time for the band. It is the culmination of a charm offensive aimed at changing the widespread (and rather accurate) view of Metallica as internet-hating rich men lashing out at a changing world. </p> <p>In 2000, the band sued Napster, contributing to the site's downfall and alienating a generation of file-sharing fans. A string of relatively under-par albums (Load, ReLoad, S&amp;M) added to the band's woes. A move towards transparency nearly backfired when the documentary Some Kind of Monster showed the warring metallers undergoing group therapy while making their least-loved album, St Anger.</p> <p>Metallica are desperate not to be seen as control freaks, misers and bullies any more, and so Death Magnetic has come trumpeted by a fly-on-the-wall promotional website; and every track is available to download as part of Guitar Hero III, the video game which takes air guitar to new virtual heights. Their mission to rekindle favour stops just short of personal band lap dances and free ice cream.</p> <p>They do give away a hell of a lot of guitar picks, mind. To make the front row as generous as possible, the band play in the round tonight, with eight microphones strategically positioned to allow Hetfield to commune with his acolytes at every point of the compass. Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo are also free-ranging, while drummer Lars Ulrich's kit revolves from north to south throughout the set, providing us with the rarely seen view of a drummer's backside. Ulrich wanders around almost as much as he sits, spitting water on grateful fans.</p> <p>The 17-song set borrows a reasonable five songs from their new album, alongside a generous dose of older, thrashier songs. Lightweight fans such as myself definitely miss their greatest hit, 'Enter Sandman', but otherwise, the pummelling stays just on the right side of heavy, and the ballads don't take up too much valuable riffing time.</p> <p>There aren't usually many innovations at a Metallica gig, but it is refreshing to hear an audible bass on 'The End of the Line'. 'Cyanide', meanwhile, sounds as good live as it did at the Death Magnetic album playback. As well as beating Scots hopefuls Glasvegas to the No 1 spot, Death Magnetic has been well-received critically, suggesting Metallica's hard work (and back-to-basics approach) has reaped dividends. Later in the set, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Master of Puppets' are blasts from the past whose aggression remains evergreen.</p> <p>For all this, fans part with just \u00a35, the proceeds of which go to the Youth Music charity. The band's charm offensive even stretches to Hetfield, so often a brooding presence. He may be a strapping figure covered in tattoos, but when he opens his mouth, the statuesque former alcoholic is surprisingly Californian and easy-going. 'Put your phones away, man,' he cajoles amiably. 'Putting a two-minute video of Metallica on YouTube isn't going to make you famous. Just enjoy the show.' </p> <p>When, at the end, the band hang around for a quarter of an hour, distributing drumsticks and guitar picks, the warmth in the arena is convincing. It is common form for bands to thank their fans volubly, but there is a new humility in this band's attitude that suggests that while these metal overlords broadcast at immense volumes, they can listen, too.</p>",
  "<h2>Film</h2> <p><strong>Philip French</strong></p> <p>Soon after the birth of cinema moviemakers became crusaders for and proponents of human rights. The American pioneer Edwin S Porter followed his milestone western The Great Train Robbery (1903) with a hard-hitting film about equality before the law. In his The Kleptomaniac (1905), a wealthy woman and a poor working-class mother are arrested for shoplifting, the former treated with respect and acquitted, the latter treated as a criminal and jailed. The first great American film, DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation (1915), the most racially prejudiced film produced outside Nazi Germany, made heroes of the Ku Klux Klan for their virtual restoration of slavery in the Deep South after the Civil War. But Griffith followed it with the even more ambitious and truly admirable Intolerance (1916), which told four parallel stories of injustice from Babylon through the Crucifixion and the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, to the conviction for murder of an innocent blue-collar worker in 20th-century America.</p> <p>With the coming of sound Hollywood developed a movie genre dealing with human rights, 'the social conscience picture', which in various forms has continued to this day. In the years after the Second World War these pictures were chiefly concerned with issues of racial prejudice: anti-semitism in Crossfire and Gentleman's Agreement (both 1947), the imposition of second-class citizenship on blacks in Pinky and Home of the Brave (both 1949). More recently, film-makers have targeted the denial of human and civil rights following 9/11 in such films as The Road to Guantanamo (2006) and Rendition (2007).</p> <p>Some movies have helped contribute to social change. The popular British film Victim (1961), for instance, speeded up the implementation of homosexual law reform recommended by the Wolfenden Committee. The Polish movie A Short Film About Killing (1988) led directly to the suspension, then abolition, of capital punishment in Poland, an influence unprecedented in a communist country. </p> <p>A similar courage is to be found in the work of those Iranian directors who have challenged censors and ayatollahs in a string of pictures criticising the treatment of women in their country, Jafar Panahi's The Circle and Marziyeh Meshkini's The Day I Became a Woman (both 2000) among them. </p> <p>No recent picture has so forcefully shown what it is like to live in a country where human and civil rights are denied or arbitrarily accorded by the government as The Lives of Others (2006), Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's picture of life under the constant surveillance of the Stasi in 1980s East Germany. It won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Of living directors, few can match the record of Richard Attenborough for the vigorous support of human rights both on and off the screen. One thinks especially of the brave movie he produced and appeared in about a trade unionist victimised by communist leaders in The Angry Silence (1960), and of two he directed - the magnificent cinebiography Gandhi (1982) and his film about Steve Biko and the anti-apartheid movement, Cry Freedom (1987). One hopes Attenborough will live to realise his dream of making a film about that great proponent of freedom and social justice Thomas Paine, author of The Rights of Man.</p> <h2>Pop</h2> <p><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p> <p>Human rights have always had a backbeat. Since a cave-dweller first put antelope femur to skin drum, songs have yearned for whatever people have lacked. Abundant prey, a good harvest, freedom from harm - fundamental versions of what we have since enshrined as basic human rights. </p> <p>Folk music has long had a crusading role in Anglophone society, documenting the plight of the downtrodden and inveighing against tyranny. Around the world, every human population has its own version, in which discontents are articulated and justice is longed for. To enumerate only the briefest highlights would take up most of The Observer's column inches this week. To explore properly the interfaces of music and humanist concerns - Band Aid, War Child, Make Trade Fair, Sting's support for Amazonian tribespeople, the works of Bono -would take a month of Sundays.</p> <p>Instead, consider this spur-of-the-moment, idiosyncratic and personal Top of the Human Rights Pops.</p> <p>At Number Three, Tori Amos with 'Cornflake Girl'. Amos's 1994 single made it to No 4 in the UK charts. To this day, few realise that it is about the horrors of female circumcision, and the betrayal of daughters by their own mothers in the name of tradition and social cohesion.</p> <p>At Number Two, Billie Holiday, 'Strange Fruit'. Originally a poem by a Jewish teacher from New York, 'Strange Fruit' is a visually sumptuous song about the lynching of black men in the American South. Pre-dating the Civil Rights movement and inspiring Bob Dylan, it is still chilling today.</p> <p>At Number One, Woody Guthrie's 'This Land Is Your Land'. Incredibly, every North American schoolchild learns this song, in which folk scion and Communist sympathiser Guthrie takes a magic realist stroll through the American landscape, asserting communal ownership of the land in a way Native Americans might have understood. The beauty and bounty of the continent, Guthrie implies, should be shared by all its inhabitants, banishing hunger, want, and subjugation. The equality of all who live there is a moot point. There are two even more political verses, little sung, decrying mass unemployment and private property. Even without these, 'This Land Is Your Land' is a deeply powerful, subliminal hymn of egalitarianism nestled in the very bosom of the deeply unequal, free-market Dark Star.</p> <h2>Books</h2> <p><strong>Jonathan Heawood</strong></p> <p>With a neat sense of timing, George Orwell completed Nineteen Eighty-Four just a week before the publication of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in December 1948. While Eleanor Roosevelt's committee produced the template for a better future, Orwell was busy imagining the alternative - a world without individual rights, where freedom and autonomy become illusions manufactured by an all-seeing, all-powerful state. He reminded generations of readers that our rights require vigilance and personal sacrifice if they are to be worth more than the paper they're written on.</p> <p>Orwell's legacy lives on in novels from Philip K Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (1968) - better known as the film Blade Runner - to The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood (1985), in which a dystopian future society is used to explore the absence of human rights. In both books, a class of being (androids, women) is categorised as subhuman, and therefore unworthy of the same rights as others and they convey a sense of the universality of rights more powerfully than any legal tract.</p> <p>Great novels such as Boris Pasternak's Doctor Zhivago (1957), Manuel Puig's Kiss of the Spider Woman (1976) or JM Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K (1983) may not namecheck the declaration, but their profound sense of injustice is animated by its promise of a better world.</p> <p>Wherever novelists evoke the plight of the individual floundering in an unjust world, human rights are at risk. These novels bring us face to face with the real meaning of universal values as they apply to individual lives.</p> <p>Human-rights abuses over the past 60 years have not been confined to fiction. In The Gulag Archipelago (1973), Alexander Solzhenitsyn described the horrors of his own imprisonment in a Soviet labour camp, and collected the testimony of 227 fellow survivors. The book led to his exile from the Soviet Union, but it opened up the hidden tragedy of millions of political prisoners to the eyes of the world. The sheer weight of historical record, and the ironic power of his writing, which is often surprisingly humorous, emphasised the brutality inherent in the Soviet system. Many people refused to believe his account when it was published. Now we know the truth to have been far worse.</p> <p>In Wild Swans (1991), Jung Chang showed how the abuse of rights can carry its pain right to the heart of the family, with a knock-on effect down the generations. With a similar emphasis on the fate of women, Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel Persepolis (2000) introduced the world to the tortured history of freedom in Iran. And Orhan Pamuk's strange, magical novel Snow (2002) exploded the myth of Turkish multiculturalism. It is no accident that these authors have suffered censorship and worse in their home countries. States that don't respect rights don't respect writers.</p> <p>Philosophers such as John Rawls, in A Theory of Justice (1971), and Ronald Dworkin, in Taking Rights Seriously (1977), have helped to bring the idea of fundamental rights into the legal mainstream, but it is the great novelists and memoirists of the past 60 years who have done most to embed human rights in the global consciousness. Most people will never read the declaration. They will never know how deeply their rights are being abused by their rulers. But if they read Wild Swans they get an overwhelming sense of what it means to live without rights. This is the first time in human history that international law has existed to defend the powerless against the powerful. But the great literature of this period is accurate in its reflection of a world which has more in common with Orwell's nightmares than the UN's dreams. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Heawood is the director of English PEN</p> <h2>Architecture</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Bayley</strong></p> <p>Modern architecture does not readily lend itself to campaigning, though modern technology made human rights possible. Item one: without the fax machine there would have been no glasnost. The truth makes you free and the clunking fax (created pre-internet so that time-shifted Japanese salarymen could receive written messages) was truth's tireless runner. Item two: the Land-Rover, like the declaration, a product of 1948, has been a liberating tool on every continent.</p> <p>But there is a small handful of buildings which work as the architecture of memory and remind us of what's at stake when freedoms become compromised. On the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 in Paris, Georges-Henri Pingusson built his haunting M\u00e9morial des Martyrs de la D\u00e9portation in 1962. It is a deafeningly silent and exquisite memorial to the 200,000 (mostly) Jews forced out of Paris during the Second World War.</p> <p>There is Daniel Libeskind's 2001 Jewish Museum on Berlin's Lindenstrasse. A concrete structure with dramatic zinc cladding, its zig-zag plan looks like a diagram of angst ... and a vital sign of resurrection. Sombre, but ultimately optimistic, it makes a wonderful contrast to Beijing's appalling Great Hall of the People, an inhuman horror completed in 1959 by what the communists are pleased to call 'volunteers', but we might more accurately call ideologic and economic slaves.</p> <p>But if human rights needs a single monument, let's choose Peter Zumthor's Bruder Klaus Feldkapelle, completed last year just outside Cologne. The Brother Klaus Field Chapel is named after a 15th-century mystic who farmed hereabouts. In his memory Zumthor has created one of the 21st century's undisputed masterpieces. Making a sort of wigwam of wood, he slowly built layer upon layer upon it. He then set fire to the wood leaving a strange charred, sculptural internal effect. A molten lead floor is lit by an oculus. It is beautiful, peaceful, mysterious and life-enhancing. Aren't these the qualities human rights are for?</p>",
  "<p>The security services planned the arrest of the journalist with painstaking care. They bugged her contacts and assembled an elite squad to take her down. On 8 May 2007, eight detectives swarmed into her home and seized her address book, mobile, laptops and bank statements. In a simultaneous raid, a second team searched her newspaper office - going through everything from filing cabinets to boxes of Cup-a-Soup by the office kettle.</p> <p>Once in custody, detectives kept her isolated from her two teenage daughters and autistic son for 24 hours. Then they began the grilling.</p> <p>'You could go to prison,' they told her.</p> <p>They let her go, but soon hauled her back in. Before her second interrogation, they left her shivering in a cell. Before her third, a woman officer put on rubber gloves and strip-searched her. After that, 'I just lost my ability to think coherently,' Sally Murrer said. 'My brain went to cotton wool.'</p> <p>Mugabe's Zimbabwe, Putin's Russia or Hu Jintao's China? No, Gordon Brown's Buckinghamshire. </p> <p>Sally Murrer, 50, is a reporter who covers the police and Women's Institute for the Milton Keynes Citizen, not a newspaper accustomed to being on the frontline between liberty and oppression. She works part-time because her disabled son needs constant care. </p> <p>When she appears in the dock in November, alongside her will be Mark Kearney, a police sergeant, and the uninitiated might assume that he somehow endangered national security by leaking to the Citizen. But they have not charged Kearney or Murrer with breaking the Official Secrets Act but with the obscure offences of respectively 'misconduct in a public office' and 'aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office'. </p> <p>The Crown alleges that she broke a story in the Citizen about Izale McLeod, star striker for MK Dons. Police arrested him after a party at the Jury's Inn on Midsummer Boulevard degenerated into a brawl. Her contacts told her later that the police would not press charges. She ran the story and described the relief of the Dons' assistant manager, Ray Mathias, who said: 'It is a great boost for the lad.' </p> <p>If that sounds a petty offence, the Crown goes on to allege that Murrer called Kearney after a local man, Doug Belcher, was killed in a fight. Murrer explained what happened next: 'That name rings a bell,' she had said. </p> <p>'It ought to because you wrote about him being arrested for supplying cannabis in the Nineties,' Kearney replied. Murrer dug out her cutting, and put that story in the paper, too.</p> <p>Finally, the prosecution has a tape of her talking to Kearney about an Islamist the authorities released early from prison, even though he had boasted about becoming a suicide bomber. She didn't even publish that story. Murrer and Kearney will tell anyone who asks that they once had an affair. With them in the dock will be Derek Webb, a private detective whose clients have included the News of the World</p> <p>Outsiders struggling to explain why the state is trying to imprison them might assume that the former lovers and Webb formed a ring to sell police secrets. Not to the Milton Keynes Citizen, obviously - the Milton Keynes Citizen doesn't do cheque-book journalism because it doesn't have a cheque book - but to Fleet Street.</p> <p>This explanation makes no more sense than the idea that Sally Murrer is the Mata Hari of the Home Counties, because the police are not alleging that money changed hands.</p> <p>Kearney certainly had enemies. He is an old-fashioned copper who had been shocked into advising his colleagues that they must all stick to the rules with terrorist suspects. In 2005, he had been ordered to bug conversations between Sadiq Khan, a Labour MP and lawyer, and a terrorist suspect facing extradition to the US on allegations of aiding the Taliban. Kearney was unhappy about spying on an MP, and his superiors knew it.</p> <p>The charges against Murrer have nothing to do with Khan, but she believes Kearney's doubts about the bugging explain why the police went wild. Her supposition remains no more than that. But the police are dragging in the suspects' children. Not only did detectives arrest Kearney, but his son, Harry, a soldier who had risked his life for his country in Afghanistan and Iraq. The young man's crime was to try to impress a pretty reporter on the Citizen's rival, the Milton Keynes News, by telling her how a dense copper had lost the keys to the custody cells at the police station. She ran the story, which was all over town anyway.</p> <p>Thames Valley officers responded in the only way they seem to know how. They raided the News, interrogated the reporter and then arrested Harry Kearney. If they carry on like this, Human Rights Watch will have to open a Buckinghamshire office.</p> <p>For however ludicrous aspects of the Murrer case may seem, it is a sinister assault on press freedom. I cannot say conclusively why they are prosecuting her, or if she has committed a crime, but I can tell you what her alleged crime is: being a journalist and doing what journalists in free countries do every day.</p> <p>If she loses, there will be a precedent for imprisoning reporters for talking to contacts in the police, local authorities or central government without official approval.</p> <p>When I first spoke to Murrer last year, I assumed that the central authorities in London did not know what Thames Valley was doing. A few months later, however, Kearney wrote about the bugging of Khan in his witness statement. Dozens of people read it, and when the police raided the home of his ex-wife, she was infuriated and told her MP about the scandal. Jack Straw, Jacqui Smith and the senior lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service learned all about the case. Not one of them told Thames Valley to back off. </p> <p>With their full knowledge, the law enforcement agencies have devoted vast effort on hounding a part-time reporter on a little local paper, while ignoring the criminals the public pays them to catch.</p>",
  "<p>What with Alastair Campbell to advise him on trust, as well as battalions of fellow pariahs offering notes for Mr Brown's Speech of a Lifetime, one hesitates, at this late stage, to propose yet another theme, even one as mesmerising as rubbish. But if, as some experts suggest, the Prime Minister should now say anything to stay in power, regardless of the cost to consistency, decency and the quality of his personal afterlife, there cannot be many other promises that would be both so easily fulfilled and so pleasing to a resentful public as a national garbage amnesty, introduced with immediate effect.</p> <p>Imagine the acclaim if Brown went further in realising the British householder's dream: a pledge of two, maybe three capacious rubbish bins for each hardworking family, tax-breaks for the most prolific rubbish producers, or better still, a new right-to-trash that guaranteed every citizen a dedicated landfill site right outside his home, with the warming effluvia diverted to supply year-round patio heating. At once, the public would be liberated from onerous garbage-sorting duties, and, more important, Brown would win the approval of various influential newspapers whose reports, more chilling by the day, chronicle the suffering of rubbish-bin martyrs, as they find themselves tricked into using smaller bags, forced to recycle, subjected to outrages that range from rubbish-weighing, crippling penalties and spies in bins to the fortnightly collections that initially inspired the Daily Mail's campaign for rubbish-disposal satisfaction, its Great Bin Revolt.</p> <p>Not that this protest, along with similar coverage in like-minded papers, has done much to reverse the attack on individual landfill rights by pitiless garbage operatives: only last week bin campaigners learned that successful trials of recycling food waste might lead, in time, to all households being obliged to use a sordid food caddy instead of, as before, leaving this unwanted organic material to rot, in civilised fashion, within the confines of black dustbin bags. 'It's like going back to the Dark Ages,' protested one householder, one of a minority who refused to use one of the detested 'slop buckets'.</p> <p>Given that any speech of a lifetime should feature, for the sake of variety, allusions to humble folk, Brown might want to cite a few more unidentifiable but very individual rubbish victims: the penniless pensioner recently sentenced to 15 years for not rinsing her milk bottles; the cheeky six-year-old summarily executed by a member of the bin Stasi who now patrol the country's dustbins, seemingly a law unto themselves. And it gets worse. Last Friday the Mail revealed that inspectors from Blackburn could easily have frightened a defenceless old lady, had she existed, when they looked over a fence to check on the number of wheelie bins per household. 'The move is the latest draconian rubbish collection measure,' the Daily Mail told readers. </p> <p>What shocks is how recently, yet with what stealth, this erosion of precious liberties appears to have been effected. Barely a decade ago most householders inhabited a rubbish Eden in which you could fill as many black bags as you liked, with more or less whatever you liked, and put them out without thought for weight, collection times, or the bags' final resting place, in one of the convenient dumps with which this happiest of countries then abounded. The beginning of the end came in 1999, when the EU landfill directive required Britain (which had so often come top, or thereabouts, for quantities of waste deposited per capita), to meet EU recycling targets or be fined into compliance; targets the government later passed on to local councils via limited allocation of landfill, again enforced by fines. Legislation designed to get householders to co-operate, finally resulted, earlier this summer, in Ian Gibson, a Labour MP, declaring - too late! - that something inexpressibly precious had gone for ever. 'It is a British way of life to have your bin emptied once a week,' he said. 'Taking that away is like losing your birthright.'</p> <p>If Brown does not have the guts to resist this assault on his country's values, the Conservatives have people who will. Well; it has one person. Shadow local government secretary Eric Pickles has made it his mission to fight for rubbish liberty; so much so that no draconian-measures story is now complete without an observation from Mr Pickles along the lines that Labour has created 'an army of municipal bin bullies hitting law-abiding families with massive fines while professional criminals get the soft touch'. </p> <p>One might attribute this aversion to bin bullies to a preference for softer, more Nudge-style techniques were it not for a recent letter, sent around Tory-run councils, in which Pickles himself threatened the addressees with nasty consequences if they got involved with Labour 'pay as you throw' pilot schemes (which, if implemented, would bring this country into line with arrangements that already operate, in the absence of civil unrest, all over Europe).</p> <p>First, Eric prophesied, bin taxes would bring down grievous want upon families who would be punished 'for having children'. One had no idea so many were routinely thrown away. Then, 'the politics of rubbish is very high on the media's agenda and a great cause of public concern. Councils that introduce bin taxes will be vilified in the popular press and punished at the polls.' Though, of course, the relevant councils might not be quite so vilified in the press were it not for the assistance of leading rubbish celebrity, Mr Eric Pickles. </p> <p>Given that he does not, in principle, oppose recycling, it remains unclear why Pickles should be so averse to tactics that are consistently increasing recycling rates, and, indeed, widely enforced by lowlier members of his own party. For any right-wing newspaper, I suppose, these tales of bin-related persecution can be seen as the latest, mischief-making variation on the hapless little-guy, jobsworth-defying genre; part of a couldn't-make-it up continuum that also features John Bull's God-given right to park where he likes and drive as fast as he likes; to physically chastise his children without the interference of Childline and to bequeath a lifetime's cheap petrol to his conker-hardened descendants. But Pickles is more puzzling. </p> <p>Does his commitment to the conservation of reeking landfill show us what Cameron's Tories truly feel, behind that husky picture, about pro-environmental measures? Or should we look more deeply at Mr Pickles, and ask if there may not be some psychological quirk that accounts for this obsession with waste products? He would not be the first. One recalls Alastair Campbell's ostentatious attachment to the word garbage, to the point that he distributed copies of the band Garbage's CD, and prided himself on inventing a little known variation, 'garbagic'. But as painful as it is to admit, garbagic's moment may have come. In a rubbish-filled time with a rubbish economy and rubbish politicians, there has never been a greater need for new words for rubbish, particularly one coined by a man whose contribution to our national life was, in itself, such spectacular rubbish.</p>",
  "<p>I was there. Twenty years on after a momentous sporting event there are usually enough first-hand witnesses around to fill the relevant stadium five times over. But I was bloody there all right - along with about 1500 others - when Graeme Hick scored 405 not out. I have the bowling figures to prove it (50-6-141-1, since you ask).</p> <p>And I was grumpy. All that guff about being involved, however peripherally, in a little bit of history, was no consolation for another thrashing around Taunton. No one had scored 400 in the County Championship since 1895, when Archie MacLaren had hit 424 not out for Lancashire, also against Somerset at Taunton. All the other quadruple centurions had scored their runs on distant fields: Karachi, Sydney, Poona and Melbourne. Hick was sparking a new era of mammoth scores.</p> <p>I was grumpy about Taunton; those straight boundaries meant that even a mishit could come to rest in the graveyard at one end or the River Tone at the other. Too often the pitch was over-friendly to batsmen, though curiously the match against Worcestershire on 5, 6, 7 and 8 May 1988 was not one of those occasions.</p> <p>Three years earlier I had witnessed another momentous - and more pleasurable - innings. On 1 June 1985 Viv Richards had smashed 322 against Warwickshire at Taunton, of course. It was a less pedestrian affair than Hick's, coming from just 258 deliveries. After he had reached his century Richards looked as if he was going to give it away: a hundred would be enough. I never saw Hick in that mood.</p> <p>But the odd catch was dropped. Captain Norman Gifford brought back the opening bowlers, a challenge that galvanised Richards, and he kept going ferociously. And everyone gasped along the way. Batting with him as he approached his triple century, I grew nervous, just in case I ran him out. Actually we did not do much running - when he was on strike.</p> <p>That had been a three-day game. Three years later I was grumpy with the Test and County Cricket Board. In their wisdom they were experimenting with four-day cricket. In 1988, six of the 22 matches in the one-division County Championship were of four days' duration rather than three. Unfortunately the game against Worcestershire was one of them. This meant that there was plenty of time for Hick to go on and on and on.</p> <p>I was grumpy with our captain, Peter Roebuck. He later recalled how Hick's first ball was hit in the air to square leg. Roebuck says that he had been thinking of stationing a fielder there as Hick took guard, but, most unusually for him, he let bygones be bygones. There was no one there as the ball sped away towards the boundary.</p> <p>And I may have been grumpy because it was Worcestershire. There was a certain frisson in Somerset-Worcestershire matches of that era. Of course this had nothing to do with Hick, who is one of the least offensive men to have picked up a cricket bat. Ian Botham had moved on from Somerset after 1986 when Richards and Joel Garner had been sacked by the club and replaced by Martin Crowe. So Botham went to Worcester. Which always added a little spice to the fixture.</p> <p>The players went through the usual pre-match routine of poking and prodding the pitch as if that would bring some enlightenment. But even that was a tense affair. Roebuck was not talking to Botham and vice versa. I was talking to both of them, but not simultaneously.</p> <p>The previous year, in a much hyped, rain-ruined match, Botham - inevitably - scored a hundred on his first return to Taunton's County Ground as a Worcestershire player (Hick b Marks 0, as a point of very necessary information). I had to bowl all day as mysterious injuries and illness afflicted our players. That always seemed to happen against Worcestershire.</p> <p>Yet all appeared to be going swimmingly on 5 May 1988. There had been the problem of an opening partnership of 78 between Tim Curtis and Gordon Lord. But from 78 for no wicket Worcestershire subsided to 132 for five. The ball was darting around nicely, unless Hick was facing.</p> <p>Damien D'Oliveira, who was batting at four for Worcestershire, recalls: 'I asked Graeme, \"What's it doing?\" \"Absolutely nothing,\" he replied. Graham Rose bowled one on off stump, it moved away and I nicked it. \"That's the only ball that's done anything,\" he said. I told him where to go.' Hick, you can be sure, would not have misled poor D'Oliveira on purpose.</p> <p>Neil Burns, Somerset's keeper, offers the obvious explanation. 'It was like two games going on. The ball was nipping about and people were nicking it in one, but Hick was batting immaculately and hitting everything for four in another.'</p> <p>When Rose took three wickets in nine balls, including what was presumed to be the vital scalp, that of Botham, Somerset seemed to be in control. No matter that Hick was still in, there were only the non-specialist batsmen at the other end. Unfortunately they were non-specialists of the most dogged type - two bloody-minded Tykes, who refused to budge: Steven Rhodes, now the coach at Worcestershire and Richard Illingworth, now an umpire.</p> <p>Rhodes batted 274 balls for his 56. 'I just tried to blunt the attack,' he says. 'It was a pleasure to run his runs for him. I played only one shot in anger and it got me out.' In the meantime he had added 265 with Hick.</p> <p>However, that Hick innings was more remarkable for its unrelenting discipline than its dazzling strokeplay. Unlike the Richards knock, there were not so many gasps along the way - just a few from 288 onwards when two straight sixes off Colin Dredge took him to 300. His colleagues reckoned that the 212 he hit on a turning pitch at Old Trafford - in April! - was a superior effort.</p> <p>At the close of the first day's play, Hick was 179 not out but, being just 21 years old, there was little chance of fatigue hampering him the following day or, given his dedication, of him getting plastered in celebration at another century. Rhodes remembers: 'Hicky's not a big drinker, but a group of us went for a Chinese meal and he had a pint of lager. Peter Roebuck came in with Graham Rose and joked the booze could make him succumb early next day.'</p> <p>Not a very funny joke. It took Hick eight hours and 411 balls to reach 300. It was risk-free; it was pragmatic and ruthlessly efficient. He hit me for a six or two over mid-on. He often did that. So a fielder was stationed at long-on and thereafter he was content to take the easiest of easy singles in that direction. I was cutting my losses, acknowledging his dominance and hoping to dismiss the bloke at the other end. A sound plan, pity about the execution.</p> <p>Hick clocked up 75 runs in each session. Brian Rose, Somerset's current director of cricket, watched from the dressing room. 'I remember Dredgie [over the years the 'Demon of Frome' had some success against Hick with his 'nip-backers'] getting an inside edge which scuttled down to third man. That was the only time I thought we might get him.'</p> <p>Around the 300 mark, Hick changed gear, opening his shoulders. When he reached that landmark I mentioned - rather uncharitably - that someone had already scored more than 400 at Taunton. It took him only 58 more balls to get there. But Phil Neale, his captain, was not intent upon breaking records for their own sake. MacLaren's record would be intact.</p> <p>'The game plan was always to get as many as we could as fast as we could,' Neale says. 'We were going to declare earlier, but I delayed it until Graeme reached 300 - he then got to 400 so quickly we still had time to bowl on that second evening. I think he always knew I'd call it a day on 400, but the team objective was always the most important thing.' When he did call it a day, Hick had scored 405 of the 550 runs added while he was at the crease.</p> <p>David Foot, that wizard of West Country wordsmiths, was there to watch Hick return to the pavilion and has recently recreated the scene. 'He should be drained with traces of elation etching through his weariness. Instead he walks with a brisk step, the face offers not a flicker of emotion as the smallish crowd, belatedly sensing the proximity of cricketing history, converges to applaud. He passes not more than a yard away and there is not the merest evidence of perspiration on his cheeks and forehead. He could be out for a walk along Worcestershire's River Severn.' Your correspondent, I think, looked a little more dishevelled.</p> <p>It was, I suppose, a great innings, but it was clinical rather than charismatic. As Roebuck wrote in Wisden the following year: 'There was never any sense of awesome personality in this awesome batting... Apart from its proportion it was not a masterpiece.' He added: 'Hick, I believe, will become a major force in Test cricket.' We all thought so. And we were all wrong.</p> <p>This helps to explain Hick's longevity in the county game, from which he retires this week aged 42. The unfulfilled at international level play on, amassing thousands of first-class runs in county cricket as some form of recompense. The same principle applies to Mark Ramprakash. It may also apply to Marcus Trescothick, whose international career was not so much unfulfilled as incomplete.</p> <p>There were moments when we thought - and hoped (for he was obviously such a decent man) - that Hick had cracked it. He hit a magnificent first Test century, 178 in Bombay in 1993, but England lost by an innings. His second most favourite Test innings, 141 against South Africa at Centurion, was in a match long since forgotten since it was ruined by torrential rain.</p> <p>We do remember his 98 not out in Sydney in 1995 when Mike Atherton declared. Atherton has since acknowledged that it was a mistake to declare, but Hick had been dithering horribly as he approached three figures. He might have made his mark in a World Cup final as part of England's best one-day side for two decades. Hick had a fine tournament in Australia in 1992, but was duped by Mushtaq Ahmed's googly in the final, lost to Pakistan.</p> <p>It is neither a tragedy nor a mystery that Hick, who has scored 136 first-class hundreds and 41,112 runs, had such a mediocre record with England. Rather, his career is a reminder of how difficult it is to succeed at the highest level. Ability alone is not enough. In a recent interview Hick said: 'I never had a cut-throat edge, that's why I fell short... Of course I would have liked to have scored 30 Test hundreds, but I might not be the person I am if I'd done that.'</p> <p>The implication here, which I do not accept, is that you have to be a ruthless bastard to excel at the highest level. It may help, but here are a few names just to start with as a counter-argument: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Michael Vaughan, Gary Kirsten... and there must be some Aussie we could throw into the pot.</p> <p>Hick had the eye; he had the talent; he had the technique; but he was not mentally strong enough to excel at the top. Of course we were blissfully unaware of that at Taunton in 1988 when he seemed so invincible. If we had known, then obviously I would have had to swear at him.</p>",
  "<p>This is a turning point for London theatre. The Donmar, that small stage with a long reach, is for a year moving into the West End: it's spreading its wings, expanding its audience, cleaving to its artistic policy but, crucially, keeping down the ticket price. It's also opening on Sundays. In front of the trad velvet curtain at Wyndham's there's a banner with the chunky Futura typography of the Donmar: it announces a new Twelfth Night, Madame de Sade and Hamlet. If these productions are anywhere near as good as <strong>Ivanov</strong>, this is a season that will send Shaftesbury Avenue soaring.</p> <p>Ivanov was a canny choice of Michael Grandage's, the Donmar's artistic director. It is recognisable but not familiar Chekhov. The first of his plays to be staged, it's compressed in feeling, and in space: it suggests a society that's bouncing off its own walls. Written at speed, it was revised at leisure. Chekhov was taken aback by people grumbling that they couldn't see why anyone would bother with the central character: he called it his blockhead play. Actually, though flawed, it's a truly important piece of work. It sends up a plea for looking rather than judging. It is one of the best ever dramatic portrayals of depression.</p> <p>Ivanov could be the love child of Hamlet and Hedda Gabler. Chekhov's hero-antihero is clouded by anxiety. He's in debt; he's fallen out of love with his wife, who left her family and her Jewish faith to marry him and who is now seriously ill: Gina McKee memorably captures the pallor and the febrile gaiety of a tubercular patient. He feels guilty, but also remorseful about not feeling sufficiently bad. He's in a miasma of melancholy, agitation and resentment. But he commits an act of violence which is muffed by most Chekhov characters. </p> <p>It's one brilliance of Tom Stoppard's light-on-its feet, ingenious but not too pleased with itself translation that Ivanov's condition - the thing that has turned him from being an idealist to a no-hoping no-hoper - is everywhere described and nowhere diagnosed. It's a sack on the back, it's a sulk, it's a melancholy which women want to cure. The mystery becomes part of its torment; it is constantly escaping, changing shape, never treatable.</p> <p>You could call it a general loss of point, a seeping away of savour. The play is in part a clinical study: Chekhov wrote it when he was writing short stories such as 'Typhus' about illnesses that engulf people as if they were moods.</p> <p>Ivanov's infection spreads its germs everywhere: everyone in his world is fighting off lassitude. When the curtain goes up on the second act it shows a sitting room paralysed by gloom. The first movement is a yawn. The most repeated word, murmured from a card table, is 'pass': its lethargic syllable punctuates the action with the precision - this is a genius piece of direction - of a string quartet. In the course of the evening, which is inflected by Adam Cork's Klezmer-influenced clarinet and string score, you see the hope draining from Christopher Oram's exemplary design, which begins with the artificial brightness of a turquoise sky and shrinks to a mud-coloured sitting room, dully lit (the hostess is too mean to pay for unnecessary candles) and mired in gloom. </p> <p>It has become commonplace to talk of Chekhov's plays as being secretly funny, and too lugubriously paced in British productions. Yet Ivanov truly is comic. It has romp and high farce: its movement, a switchback between pathos, fear and hilarity, is quicker, cruder and more violent than the most celebrated Chekhov plays: Chekhov said he wanted to give the audience a sock in the jaw at the end of each act, and he did. There is a crying quartet which turns into high comedy. A confessional soliloquy by the hero is continually interrupted by his father-in-law dipping in and out. You don't know where the play is going to swerve in tone: it lurches unpredictably. The hysteria of the movement is the point.</p> <p>This is a play that mimics the moods of its hero: it flashes and changes, goes up and down, in and out of sense, as if it were being pushed out of control. Its sympathies are unexpected. A doctor, who tries to protect Ivanov's wife, and who looks, in the rising star Tom Hiddleston's interpretation, very much like a young Trotsky - wispy, bespectacled, earnest - is accurate in his denunciations, but discredits himself by making his honesty into a badge of honour. Its glories are various. Malcolm Sinclair as an ambiguous uncle is one of them. There's a very funny drunken discussion about the best things to eat when you have the munchies; there's a terrific Chekhoppardian description of the weirdness of the central character. In this version he makes the world look not, as Constance Garnett has it in the old 20th-century version, like a 'museum of curiosities', but like 'a sort of modern art gallery - I look at things and don't know what to make of them.' It might be possible here to think of Nicholas Soames and a Damien Hirst stuffed animal face to face.</p> <p>Kenneth Branagh, artistic associate in the project, returns to the stage as Ivanov. And triumphs. He begins as an unlikely depressive: so bluff in face and body. Which makes him the more convincing as someone gripped by illness: he seems to be descended on, taken over by something which is to do with himself but not explained by himself. He is by turns stunned and disgruntled; when he crumples, falling on his feet, at an act of generosity, it is as if he is being unravelled.</p> <h2>Vox pop</h2> <p>Is Tom Stoppard haing a laugh with Chekov's tragedy</p> <p><strong>John Plummer</strong><br>60, tourist</p> <p>It was incredibly well done, all the characters were very well cast. Tom Stoppard's adaptation made the play; the original script itself is getting a little dated. I found the added satire very refreshing.</p> <p><strong>Eamon Ali</strong><br>20, student</p> <p>It was fantastic - very sparse but very powerful. And really well staged to the point of having a filmic effect. It's great that you got the sense of Slavic society without everyone having to resort to comedy Russian accents.</p> <p><strong>Beth Goldstein</strong><br>53, professor of education policy</p> <p>The script itself was a little surprising; it's not the Chekhov that I'm used to seeing. It had a farcical quality. It's interesting how Stoppard works with the anti-Semitism of the period in the narrative.</p> <p><strong>Otty Stride</strong><br>18, unemployed</p> <p>I found the open references to Hamlet one of the most striking elements of the play. The fact that the author had the courage to walk in Shakespeare's shadow was incredibly powerful. I preferred Mamma Mia! though.</p> <p><strong>Kiran Kheta</strong><br>32, lawyer</p> <p>The whole cast was brilliant. The dramatic structure didn't have its foundations purely in any one of the characters, although I did especially enjoy Kenneth Branagh's Eeyore-like Ivanov. </p> <p><strong>Interviews by Charlie Gilmour</strong></p>",
  "<p>A huge explosion ripped through part of a luxury hotel in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, today, damaging buildings in a wide radius, killing scores and injuring many more.</p> <p>The blast, one of the biggest seen in Pakistan in recent years, took place at the Marriott hotel. The hotel was left burning fiercely all along its facade with fears that it could totally collapse.</p> <p>Scores of bodies were being brought out of the flaming building as rescue workers battled the blaze in scenes of chaos. There are fears that the final death toll is likely to be well into the hundreds. </p> <p>Hotel staff said that all the Marriott's function rooms, including the large ballroom, had been hired for iftar \u2013 the traditional communal meal that breaks the day-long fast that Muslims observe during the holy month of Ramadan. </p> <p>Senior police official Asghar Raza Gardezi said that the blast, one of the biggest such attacks in Pakistan for over a decade, was caused by more than a tonne of explosives.</p> <p>Saleem Shahzad, a doctor, said he had been called to the hotel to check on an ill aircrew member staying there and was parking his car when the bomb went off. \"I found myself carrying dozens of bodies across the street instead,\" he said.</p> <p>Witnesses spoke of corpses strewn on the ground. </p> <p>Scores of ambulances rushed to the scene, negotiating burned out vehicles scattered around the hotel and a vast crater left by the explosion. </p> <p>Windows in buildings hundreds of metres away in residential areas and a heavily guarded compound where ministers have their official homes were damaged. </p> <p>Such was the force of the blast the commandoes surrounded the residence of the prime minister who was dining with the chief of army staff, Ashfaq Kayani, fearing a rocket attack, sources said.</p> <p>The Marriott is in the centre of the city, close to the national assembly, the main commercial thoroughfare and the national television headquarters. </p> <p>A 250-room hotel with five restaurants, a bar, a swimming pool, a health club, spa, business centre and numerous function rooms, security has been high at the hotel since an attempted suicide bombing in 2007, foiled by a security guard.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Chopra cemented Sunderland's reputation as being the kings of the late goal as he scored twice in the last 10 minutes for Roy Keane's side as they beat Middlesbrough 2-0. It was also an individual triumph for Chopra, who came off the substitutes' bench to make his first appearance of the season. The striker has recently been in Tony Adams' Sporting Chance clinic, battling personal problems.</p> <p>By the time the former Newcastle player latched on to Kieran Richardson's pass to slot past Ross Turnbull in the Middlesbrough goal to open the scoring in the 81st minute, his side should have been behind. Stewart Downing missed a penalty six minutes earlier after Nyron Nosworthy was harshly adjudged to have brought down J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re. The England man blazed his penalty high into the stand much to the delight of the home supporters. Chopra got his second in the dying minutes to punish Gareth Southgate's side for some poor finishing. </p> <p>The visitors were dealt a blow before kick-off when Mido was injured during the warm-up and his place was taken by Afonso Alves. Boro kicked off with Downing being asked to support Alves in attack with Adam Johnson lining up on the left, and David Wheater filling in at right-back.</p> <p>Sunderland put themselves under pressure with three minutes gone when the goalkeeper Craig Gordon slipped as he tried to control Anton Ferdinand's back-pass under pressure from Alves and hacked the ball out for a corner. Downing's cross was cleared to Didier Digard, who smashed a long-range shot over the bar. The Teessiders were dominating, although the home side had a glimmer of a chance five minutes later when Djibril Ciss\u00e9 got the benefit of a tight offside decision, but wasted it by slicing his effort embarrassingly wide.</p> <p>The Frenchman went closer from 22 yards with nine minutes gone after Wheater hooked another Downing corner across the face of goal, but missed the target. Gordon was called upon to make the game's first save after 19 minutes when Alves's free-kick was blocked to Downing, who fired in a first-time shot that the Scotland international did well to turn away. Sunderland finally responded and Ciss\u00e9 saw a cross and then a shot blocked as his side exerted real pressure for the first time. </p> <p>Boro threatened after 26 minutes when Downing's cross from the left was met by Aliadi\u00e8re, although his attempt to cushion the ball past Gordon only succeeded in sending it wide of the far post. The Wearsiders were in need of creativity in the middle of the park, where Gary O'Neil and Digard were dominant. However, Steed Malbranque was starting to have a bigger influence, and it took a well-timed challenge by Robert Huth to block Ciss\u00e9's 33rd-minute shot after his compatriot had played the ball into the channel.</p> <p>Alves just overdid it with a threaded pass to Aliadi\u00e8re 10 minutes before the break, but, as the game opened up, Ciss\u00e9 got in on the Sunderland right and Huth had to hack away his cross as the red and white shirts gathered in the middle. But Boro's Brazilian striker would have given his side a 37th-minute lead had it not been for Gordon's resilience.</p> <p>Boro broke swiftly through Johnson, who slid the ball into Alves's path, but Gordon got his angles right to block the resulting shot with his legs. The half finished with a flurry of activity as first Ciss\u00e9 and then Aliadi\u00e8re went for goal after turning neatly, but neither man troubled the respective goalkeepers. Keane was forced to make a change on the stroke of half-time when Teemu Tainio, who had earlier hurt his shoulder in a clash with Alves, was replaced by Chopra. </p> <p>Ciss\u00e9 wasted a glorious opportunity to create a chance for his side within seconds of the restart. He collected Chopra's flick wide on the right and then prepared to take on the covering Huth. The defender slipped as Ciss\u00e9 danced towards him, presenting the striker with a clear run into the box. But Ciss\u00e9 crossed the ball out of play.</p> <p>After 51 minutes, Ferdinand blocked a long-range effort from O'Neil, allowing Sunderland to break swiftly. Huth had to get in a crucial challenge at the near post to prevent Chopra from reaching Pascal Chimbonda's cross. But Gordon continued to be the busier of the two goalkeepers, and he had to get down well to turn away another Alves effort two minutes later.</p> <p>As the game moved from end to end, Richardson fired over the top after Chopra had laid off Malbranque's cross. Chopra's 58th-minute run from his own half put Ciss\u00e9 into a promising position on the right, but he was held up and when the ball returned to him after changing hands several times, he crossed it straight into Turnbull's waiting arms.</p> <p>The Boro goalkeeper almost handed Sunderland the lead four minutes later when, having collected the ball, he dropped it at El Hadji Diouf's feet and he fed it out to Ciss\u00e9. He curled the ball towards goal, but Emanuel Pogatetz made a fine block as he and Huth threw themselves into the path of the shot. Both managers made double substitutions as the game entered its final quarter with Digard, Johnson, Diouf and Ciss\u00e9 making way for Mohamed Shawky, Justin Hoyte, Andy Reid and Daryl Murphy.</p> <p>But Keane's changes had the great impact, setting up the two-goal finale.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Gordon Brown will be answering questions in a live Q&amp;A session from around 3.40pm. Joining the prime minister will be Alistair Darling, the chancellor, Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, Yvette Cooper, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and John Hutton, the business secretary. Click back then for live coverage.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> The timetable is running late. It looks as if the Brown Q&amp;A won't start for another 15 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Ed Miliband is speaking at the moment. He's doing a Cameron/Clegg and reciting it without any notes.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Miliband has finished. As a warm-up act, Brown could not have asked for more, because Miliband paid lavish tribute to him.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>4.15pm:</strong> Dianne Hayter, the chair, says the Q&amp;A will be devoted to the economy because of what has happened in the financial markets over the last seven days.</p> <p>The session starts with some YouTube footage showing questions from people who want to know what the government will do to help them.</p> <p>Hayter introduces the ministers. She says there is \"no one better qualified\" to deal with the UK's problems.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4.15pm: </strong> Brown moves to the front of the platform and welcomes delegates, especially those from the northern cities \"that that Conservative thinktank [Policy Exchange] wanted to abandon\". The delegates aren't sure whether to laugh or not. They applaud mildly. He also says that, with the JK Rowling donation, Labour now has \"magic\" behind it. This gets a mild laugh.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Moving on to the economy, Brown says nobody would have imagined the events of recent days. With the American government now controlling AIG, that makes the American government \"the shirt sponsors of Manchester United\". Come to think of it, in the light of Northern Rock Alistair Darling is the shirt sponser of Newcastle United, he says.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> Brown says the government will do \"whatever it takes\" to protect people in the current environment. That's why the government facilitated the HBOS/Lloyds TSB takeover.</p> <p>The government is trying to get \u00a38m back from the US to pay the money owed to the Lehman Brothers staff who lost their jobs - not the high-paid bankers, but people like the cleaners.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4.25 pm:</strong> At testing times, \"this is not about public relations\". The real test is the judgment you make. The government could have let Northern Rock fall. That was the Conservative party position, he says. But the government brought it into public ownership to save jobs and savings.</p> <p>And the Conservatives were also in favour of doing nothing over HBOS, he says. But the government disagreed.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4.25 pm:</strong> He says the Tories are in favour of taking away all regulation from mortgages (which is not quite true - it was proposed by a commission chaired by John Redwood, but it was never adopted as party policy). Brown contrasts that with the government's pro-regulatory stance.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> A testing time \"is not just a test of your judgment, it's a test of your values\". You could leave people on their own. Or you could choose to stand beside people.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> There must be a text of Brown's remarks. I've just checked on <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/conference\">the Labour conference website</a> and it's not there yet. But try it later.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> Brown has wound up now with a peroration about serving all the people of the country.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> Hayter invites questions. A delegate wants to know what Brown can say to people worried about losing their jobs. Another asks about fairness in the workplace. And a delegate from the TSSA, a rail union, wants to know why the government only got round to banning short-selling on Thursday, and why the ban will only last until January.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> On the threat to jobs, Brown says the situation now is better than it was in the early 1990s, interest rates are lower, company balance sheets are in better health and public investment is higher. The government has also been working to get oil prices down.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4.35pm:</strong> Darling takes over. He agrees that the government must do something about workers who are forced to go self-employed. On short-selling, he says there are different kinds of short-selling. Sometimes it can be useful, because it provides firms with funds. But the present crisis was created because banks did not understand the extent of their liabilities.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>4.35pm:</strong> Darling pays tribute to the work Brown did as chancellor.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Harman intervenes to say a few words. She says that while \"Alistair and Gordon\" are taking big decisions, ordinary people are also having to take difficult decisions as a result of the credit crunch. \"We're taking these big decisions because we know people are concerned about decisions in their lives.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4.40pm:</strong> Another round of questions. A delegate says the party ought to concentrate on \"real issues\" and not \"indulgent issues of leadership\". The conference should send a message of unity. She gets a good round of applause. \"I think the conference agrees with you,\" says Hayter.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4.45pm:</strong> Cooper picks up on a question on housing. She says the government has already taken steps to help get first-time buyers into the market.</p> <p>Darling is talking about financial regulation now. It needs to be \"robust\".</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> Brown says \"the eyes of the country\" are upon Labour. They want the party to be discussing issues that relate to their jobs and their livelihoods. That should be the \"undivided focus\" of the party. That's his message to the rebels, ie shut up. It's about as explicit as he's got.</p> <p>He stresses that money is moving across frontiers now in a way that it wasn't a decade ago. There has to be a global system of regulation and supervision. Trade unions know that they have to organise internationally. Brown says he's been making this point for years.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4.50pm:</strong> It's been a good afternoon for Brown so far. There's been no dissent on the conference floor and he's already made two speeches, a tribute to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/sep/20/labour.labourconference1\">Philip Gould</a> and the introduction to this session.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> One delegate asks if recent events have diminished Brown's faith in free markets. And - oops, it looks as if my remarks about dissent were a bit premature. A delegate from local government asks if Brown realises how demoralised people are in the public sector.</p> <p>And another delegate asks about support for the developing world.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Hutton takes the question about free markets. He says the party supports fair markets, but that where consumers are being ripped off, the government has a duty to intervene.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Darling says its important to remember that the purpose of a supervisory system is to ensure fairness. (In case you hadn't noticed, fairness is the theme of the conference).</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> Darling takes the question about morale in the public sector. Guessing that the delegate was referring to pay, he says pay has to be fair. But it's important not to allow inflation to become entrenched in the system. That would harm people on fixed incomes, but would not affect the wealthy.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> Cooper says pay restraint should apply from the top down. This is not the year we should be seeing big pay increases at the top.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.00pm:</strong> Brown says he's not complacent. But no government has done as much as this one to expand the public sector since 1997. He understands people's frustration about wages. But there is a danger that wage increases could be wiped out if inflation were allowed to run out of control.</p> <p>\"We're a party that believes markets are in the public interest, but they are not to be equated with the public interest,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.05pm:</strong> Brown also makes quite a nice joke about Nick Clegg. \"We have a Liberal leader who thinks that the pension is \u00a330.\" Maybe that's because, after the \u00a320bn Lib Dem spending cuts, that's all it would be worth.</p> <p>Hayter says there isn't time for any more questions. That's it.</p>",
  "<p>As with every storm, Hurricane Ike will be either a boom or bust for politicians. Some will reaffirm the trust that voters placed in them. Others will embarrass their constituents on a national stage. Some politicians shine in the spotlight. Others just crash and burn. Bill White, the mayor Houston, Texas, and Ed Emmit, a Harris County judge, have shone, going so far as to camp out and become dispatchers when relief supplies bottlenecked, leaving people waiting in line for hours for <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5j1-eePmsAFbrAFeJiWjgcT2N8MkgD938NUPO1\">ice that was sitting in a parking lot</a> at a sports arena.</p> <p>To their south however, Lyda Ann Thomas, the mayor of Galveston, appears to be going through an emotional meltdown. On Tuesday, Thomas announced that <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/6008016.html\">Galveston residents would be allowed back</a> on Galveston Island briefly. Predictably to everyone but Thomas and her city manager, thousands rushed back to the island, clogging the major highway with a 10-mile long traffic jam and burning already scarce gasoline. Thomas quickly <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared-gen/ap/National/Ike.html\">reversed her decision</a>, leaving thousands of her constituents parked on the highway waiting to enter, justifiably irate.</p> <p>The next day she was <a href=\"http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6007333.html\">reduced to tears</a> during a meeting of the remnants of the Galveston city council when a council member <a href=\"http://www.galvnews.com/story.lasso?ewcd=1a4a1627b84941fd&amp;-session=TheDailyNews:42F9480F166a005616LJj2526E0A\">accused Thomas of showing favouritism</a> by allowing a selected few to return to the island and providing essential services such as tetanus shots to city employees while denying them to residents that remained on the island.</p> <p>There are some things that have changed about hurricanes in recent years. Hurricane Katrina hangs over the head of every coastal area politician. Nobody wants to be the next Ray Nagin (the mayor of New Orleans), Kathleen Blanco (the former governor of Louisiana) or George Bush. Even Bush doesn't want to be Bush. He took to the airwaves last Saturday morning to send a message that he was aware that a hurricane had struck the fourth largest city in the country.</p> <p>For his efforts, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) remains the whipping boy for everything that goes wrong in the aftermath of the storm. <a href=\"http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7012296762\">\"Blame Fema\"</a> is the new post-hurricane mantra. I didn't even know Fema existed as a child. Prior to Katrina, most Americans likely didn't know what Fema did, and apparently some local officials still don't know.</p> <p>Despite news reports to the contrary, most Texans aren't relying on Fema. They are relying instead on what we have always relied on in hurricane country: the FFEMA, the Family and Friends Emergency Management Agency.</p> <p>Our family disaster response swung into action when I got the call from my mother at 7:00am a week ago. Jefferson County officials had <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7d9b78b4-8064-11dd-99a9-000077b07658.html\">ordered a mandatory evacuation</a> of my hometown in southeast Texas. My parents and extended family hadn't bothered to unpack from their evacuation for Hurricane Gustav a little over a week earlier. My mother wanted to head west toward me, but ended up heading north.</p> <p>After that initial call, as is typical, the cell phone circuits were jammed and calls could not go through. Text messages became the only reliable means of communication. My parents didn't know how to text message, however. My sister on the east coast sent me a text the following morning that, after travelling overnight, my parents and assorted extended relatives had finally reached Arlington, Texas, where they were near family.</p> <p>My two sisters who live in Houston messaged that they had decided to ride the storm out. My sister in the suburbs north of Houston lost an oak tree, but they survived Ike with no major structural damage. After a day and a half without electricity however, the novelty of playing board games in the dark got old, and they messaged that they were coming to stay with me in Austin.</p> <p>Like my family, most people aren't waiting around for the federal or state government. They are clearing their streets, creating their own rudimentary power grids by draping extension cords across streets and driveways to <a href=\"http://www.nwanews.com/adg/News/237587/\">share electricity with neighbours</a>. Family members in unaffected areas are driving into town with coolers full of ices and five-gallon gasoline canisters strapped to roofs of cars and SUVs. It was a bit disconcerting driving on I-35 watching an SUV with six full five-gallon gas canisters strapped on top. Is that safe?</p> <p>People are doing what they have always done after major storms, they are adapting to the situation. Which is why I taught my 60-something-year-old mother how to text message on Sunday when I drove to check on them at their hotel in north Texas. Cell phone companies can provide GPS, internet service and picture mail, but they haven't quite figured out how to cope with all of the families and friends who clamour for contact with each other in times of disaster.</p> <p>Mama figured it out in about three minutes. In her exuberance in sending and receiving messages I had to caution her that text messaging is not part of her cellular plan. Her newly discovered modern day Morse code was probably costing her $0.15 a message. She didn't appear to care. Contact with the outside world was more than worth it.</p> <p><em>This is the second of a two-part article on the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in Texas.

Here's some team news for this tea-time fixture, with the most notable omissions being from the Arsenal team, where England's babe Theo Walcott has been wrapped in cotton wool and rested this afternoon. Robin van Persie has also slipped onto the bench. Walcott is replaced by Song in the midfield; Nicklas Bendtner gets his chance up front. For the home team, Elmander failed his late fitness test and Ricardo Gardner plays up front alongside Kevin Davies. The other Kevin - Nolan - provides the attacking threat from midfield.</p> <p>Here's how they line up:</p> <p><strong>Bolton</strong>: Jaaskelainen, Steinsson, Shittu, Andrew O'Brien,<br>Samuel, Joey O'Brien, Smolarek, Muamba, Nolan, Gardner, Davies.<br>Subs: Al Habsi, Hunt, Riga, Helguson, McCann, Vaz Te, Cohen.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal</strong>: Almunia, Sagna, Toure, Gallas, Clichy, Eboue,<br>Fabregas, Song Billong, Denilson, Adebayor, Bendtner. Subs:<br>Fabianski, Van Persie, Vela, Walcott, Ramsey, Djourou, Gibbs.<br>Referee: Steve Bennett (Kent)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The Guardian office is abuzz with television watching this afternoon.</strong> Robin Lynch has been watching the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.livefoursomes\">Ryder Cup foursomes</a>; Scott Murray is going to watch the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf7\">Ryder Cup four-balls</a>; Josh Widdicombe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/20/premierleague\">watched the clock all afternoon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/20/premierleague.roundup\">Richard Aikman watched everything else</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Arsenal can go top</strong> if they win here today. They clearly feel that they can do it without their current favourite son, although Walcott and Van Persie are both on the bench if things are all looking a bit Kyiv late on.</p> <p>Bolton, meanwhile, <strong>give a debut to Ebi Smolarek</strong>, on a season loan from Racing Santander.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Clickety click, clack, clack. Peep. They're off, with the Reebok bathed in late summer sun. Bolton opt against the traditional hoist out to the wing from the kick-off and instead play it short and win a free kick. That's lofted into the box in search of Kevin Davies, but Arsenal clear.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 mins:</strong> Denilson has lined up on the right and finds some space. He sends a long cross to the back post, aimed for Adebayor, but Smolarek gets a solid Polish head on it and it goes for a corner. Fabregas whips that one in, to no effect.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong>Fabrice Muamba finds some empty field in front of him in the Arsenal half, but squares it and it's lost. But a moment later, a bobbling ball in midfield reaches Kevin Nolan, who spots Almunia off his line and has a try from 30 yards. Almunia stumbles backwards to claw it over the bar. The corner comes to nowt.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> A pensive Theo Walcott looks on as Arsenal attempt to stroke the ball around midfield and exert some authority. Bolton, equally characteristically, are having none of it, and hassle them off it. Andy O'Brien then lofts a free kick into the rabble on the penalty spot, but Arsenal clear from Smolarek. It's a busy start.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Corner for Arsenal this time comes to nothing, but the Gunners pick it up again and fizz it through the midfield. Steinsson then concedes another corner, which Fabregas inswings from the left. And that's <em>another</em> corner, when a Bolton head thumps it over the bar. Fabregas outswings this one from the right, and Steinsson clears.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> Some sustained keep-ball from Arsenal, but Bolton push them all the way back to Almunia. A more direct approach sees Adebayor scampering after one chipped over the back line, but Jaaskelainen gathers.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> A better ball, on the floor, through the Bolton defence has Adebayor again chasing through on goal. This time a well-timed slide from Andy O'Brien gives another corner - their fifth - to Arsenal. Fabregas troubles no one with the dead ball.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 mins: GOAL! Bolton 1-0 Arsenal</strong><br>After a host of ineffectual corner from Arsenal, Bolton show how it should be done as Kevin Davies leaps higher than Kolo Toure and heads home, profiting from a bizarre decision from Gael Clichy to move off the line right as the kick is taken. Simple Bolton goal, the kind we've seen countless times before. Davies already has three goals this year.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 mins: </strong>Arsenal have bossed possession in these opening stages, but it was textbook Bolton for that goal: Davies simply rose highest in the box to nod in. At the other end, Denilson has a stab from 25 yards that bananas well wide.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Another Bolton corner causes minor havoc in the Arsenal box, with Toure and Gallas getting in each other's way before one of them is able to hack clear. Back at the other end, it's yet another corner - the 911th of the first 20 minutes - and it eventually drops for Toure, who skims one wide from the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> <em>That</em> close for Arsenal as Adebayor goes galloping through the middle to latch on to a neat flick from Nicklas Bendtner, beats the defender and the goalkeeper but not the inside of the post. It pings out.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23 mins:</strong> Now it's <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> close again for Arsenal as, first, Danny Shittu throws himself in front of a Nicklas Bendtner shot from six yards that is destined for the bottom corner. Then Song rises highest from the resulting cross and heads onto the <em>other</em> Bolton post. Arsenal should be level.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>26 mins GOAL! Bolton 1-1 Arsenal </strong><br>Inevitable equaliser for Arsenal as Bolton sit way too deep and allow Cesc Fabregas to prowl on the edge of the box. He dinks it to Bendtner, who in turn dinks it through the static Bolton backline for Adebayor, who actually opts to leave it for Emmanuel Eboue to cut in from the left and beat Jaaskelainen. A suspicion of offside, but that's 1-1.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>28 mins GOAL! Bolton 1-2 Arsenal </strong><br>And that's two goals in 60 seconds for an Arsenal lead. Again Bolton are nowhere near a terrific passing move from the visitors, which ends with Denilson this time cutting in from the left. He cuts it back to Nicklas Bendtner who slots it confidently into the net.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>30 mins: </strong>Danny Shittu has hours with the ball at his feet on the edge of the Arsenal box, but dithers for 59-odd minutes and allows Sagna to nip in and launch a counter attack. This time it comes to nothing, but Arsenal are formidably quick when going forward and the scoring is by no means over here.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>34 mins:</strong> Joey O'Brien launches into Eboue on the half-way line and concedes a free kick. Wisely, Arsenal play it to feet and roll it among themselves on the edge of the home side's penalty area. Eventually the ball-watching from Bolton ends and a toe is reluctantly stabbed ball-ward and, what do you know, it works. Up the other end, Steinsson slips as he attempts to cross from the right and there's grand ironic cheers.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>36 mins: </strong>Bolton's best hopes here are from set pieces, and Andy O'Brien hoists another one into the box that Arsenal manage to clear. But here's the danger: Arsenal are super-slick on the counter attack, and this time Denilson tees up Eboue in the box, who dances through three or four Bolton \"defenders\" before his shot is charged down. A sharp knife through very soft butter.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Kolo Toure is flattened by Kevin Davies when the pair of them go up for, guess what, a long ball to the striker from the back. Toure is insistent that there's an elbow and tries to convince the referee of that point, but it's nothing more than your regular striker on centre-half aerial duel and Toure should know better.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> Finally some effective and direct play from Bolton as Ricardo Gardner puts his head down and charges into the Arsenal box. He ploughs through four men before a last-gasp lunge from Toure stops him in his tracks. The ball squirms to Joey O'Brien, back to goal, who lays it off to Kevin Nolan, who has a shy from just inside the box. Diving to his left, Almunia paws it behind. Good shot, good save, pretty good game, in truth.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>44 mins: </strong>Jlloyd Samuel can't deal with the attentions of both Bacary Sagna and Denilson in the left-back spot as Arsenal again pull the Bolton defenders all over the place. Sagna's cross is headed behind for the 9,228th corner of the match, which eventually comes to the feet of Fabregas in the box. Desperate lunges finally clear the danger, but Bolton really need to close down much quicker.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 mins:</strong> Another chance for Bolton as Kevin Davies flicks on a long throw for fellow Kevin, Nolan, to volley from 18 yards. It's swerving but not enough and beats the outside of the post, as well as Almunia. Bolton have definitely had their chances from this direct approach, but they've been mighty shoddy at the back.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45+2 mins:</strong> Time enough in this half for Kevin Davies to pick up Bolton's seventh yellow card of the season - and it might have been red. The, let's say, committed forward slides in two-footed and full-blooded to Gael Clichy, who had lost control of the ball and so had dangled his left foot out in front of him. That could definitely have done something damaging to the Arsenal full back, but the spray seems to have cured it. Fabregas blots his copybook by reaching for the imaginary card and brandishes it in Steve Bennett's face; lots more people huff and puff, as the Scottish brogue of Craig Burley, in the Setanta commentary box, insists that there's nothing wrong with that. He is quickly silenced.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Talk in the commentary box of a \"sour taste\" in the mouth after than last-minute Davies lunge, but it's coffee for this mouth right now. Back in 15.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Still half-time: </strong> Just scanning through these teams' results in preparation for this MBM cast some doubt on the FA's 'random' fixture generator, which has ensured that so far this season, both Bolton and Arsenal have played Newcastle, West Brom and Fulham, among their four fixtures. Bolton lost to Newcastle and Fulham and drew with the Baggies, while Arsenal stuffed Newcastle and edged past West Brom, but also lost to Fulham. Fulham, therefore, are almost certain to win the league, despite today's defeat to Blackburn, and no one's ever going to believe that there's anything random about anything anymore.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>What <em>is</em> happening to our game?</strong> Setanta have got hold of a quote from the referee Steve Bennett about that Davies/Clichy challenge. \"It wasn't a two-footed tackle,\" Bennett said. \"He won the ball.\" Whatever you think about that, I'm just amazed that a referee is being asked to justify his decisions to the media while the match is actually still going on. That's it: my NUJ membership card is being thrown onto the turf as I type with the other hand.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> That mini-rant meant I missed the start of the second half, and neglected to tell you that Clichy was indeed injured by the Davies tackle and is on his way to hospital. Djourou is on in his place.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 mins: </strong>Jussi Jaaskelainen keeps Bolton in this one with a wonderful, one-handed save as Song drills a vicious shot towards his right-hand post. The Finn is at full stretch to palm it behind. That would have been that.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 mins: </strong>\"Why oh why are Arsenal subject to so many nasty kicks?\" wonders Kim Taylor, before proffering an explanation. \"Is it because our lads (I am an AFC steward) are more adept at passing and moving with the ball? Do other teams just target Arsenal's legs rather than the goal?\" Yes and no, but being an Arsenal steward I expect you see Arsenal more than most other teams, and there's a good deal of fouling against other teams, I can assure you. \"I fear for Theo in the Premier League sometimes as Wenger doesn't seem to ask for violence on the pitch. Should he?\" I think you'll find that there have been a fair few kicks dished out by players under Wenger's stewardship in the Premier League, Kim.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Smolarek gets a talking to from Steve Bennett for clipping Fabregas as the Arsenal midfielder casually flicks the ball through the midfield. No card. The Bolton fans start chanting, the Arsenal players continue to play it around midfield before a through-ball aimed at Adebayor is cut out by Shittu.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>56 mins: </strong>Smolarek is replaced by the Latvian-named Holland U21 international Mustapha Riga for Bolton. Theo Walcott warms up for the Gunners. Arsenal are comfortable here, but are going to need another goal to wrap it up for sure. Djourou whips one in from the right but Adebayor heads wide.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>58 mins: </strong>Joey O'Brien daisy-cuts one past Almunia's right stick from 25 yards, then Nicklas Bendtner also fires one in from similar distance that Jussi Jaaskelain deals with easily.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 mins:</strong> Gavin McCann replaces a disconsolate Joey O'Brien, who stalks off with all the haste of a 90th minute time-wasting sub. After some sustained pressure from Bolton, the inevitable counter-attack has Adebayor scampering after a long ball and toeing it past Muamba. The Bolton man misses the ball, gets some leg and earns a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Now it's a Bolton counter attack as Riga, on the left wing, breaks clear and cuts in. He shoots low from 20 yards, from the left, and Almunia pushes it wide for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>65 mins: </strong>Three corners on the bounce for Bolton, all bent into the six-yard box. Almunia deals with each of them: punching the first two behind and catching the third.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 mins: </strong>Good pressure from Bolton as Sagna is forced to concede a throw as he gets a foot in to block Nolan. Then a loose ball falls to Gavin McCann who forces Almunia to save with his feet when he fires in a low howitzer.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 mins:</strong> Arsenal are now defending deep and in number as Bolton are finding more space in midfield. Riga is looking threatening down the left and Arsenal are backing off, as Bolton did in the first half. Almunia plucks one long cross out of the sky and sends the fleet-footed Denilson and Adebayor off on the charge, but Steinsson deals with it.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>70 mins: </strong>Fabrice Muamba dispossesses Sagna in the Arsenal half, but leaves the ball behind as he attempts to bulldoze forward. Eventually the ball is bent into the box from the right, but Kevin Nolan is unable to keep his header down and Arsenal breathe.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>72mins:</strong> Theo Walcott has peeled off the cotton wool and is out of his protective jim-jams, and it about to replace Nicklas Bendtner. That should open things up. Meanwhile, Riga, who has also looked lively, gets to the byeline but sees his cross comfortably caught by Almunia.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> Bolton seem to have learnt their lesson, at least defensively, from their first half mauling and are defending much further forward now. Adebayor is forced to head towards goal from the edge of the box, which is safely dealt with by Jaaskelainen. At the other end, Sagna and Davies go up for a long ball and it's the corn-rows of the Arsenal player who comes off worst from the clash of heads.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 mins: </strong>Alex Song gets booked for I know not what, but Bolton waste the resulting free kick by picking out the only empty space in an Arsenal box otherwise teeming with white shirts. Set pieces are still their best chance to prosper here, so that's especially profligate.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>79 mins: </strong>Gavin McCann clips Djourou heels out on the Arsenal right, allowing Denilson the chance to curl one in. Muamba stumbles, but Eboue isn't able to get his shot in. Eventually, the ball is played into Walcott's feet by Fabregas, and it's in his favoured position just inside the right edge of the box. He's lost his Croatia radar, though, and drags the angled drive wide.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>81 mins:</strong> Song wins a corner on the left and Fabregas whips it into the near post. Samuel clears. Walcott and Eboue try to manufacture something down the right, before the ball eventually falls for Fabregas, who thunders a shot high into the stands. Ricardo Vaz Te replaces Fabrice Muamba for Bolton.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong>Two excellent chances for Bolton. The effervescent Riga has a shot charged down after he drifted into space from the left, then a free header from the resulting corner is woefully directed over the bar by Steinsson.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> Bolton could well be level after some comical nonsense from Almunia - needlessly being drawn out of goal to the right and then struggling to recover his position. He can only palm a cross to the feet of Vaz Te, but his strike is feeble and allows Almunia an easy save. Aaron Ramsey replaces Eboue.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>86 mins: GOAL! Bolton 1-3 Arsenal</strong><br>And who'd have thought: Arsenal score on the counter attack. Bolton are all forward for a free kick, but it's cleared and falls for Theo Walcott near the centre circle. He drives forward, feeds Adebayor on the right, who has held his line well. The striker powers towards the byeline before squaring for Denilson to tap in. Typical Arsenal: their own penalty area to opposition's net in about nine seconds. Fabregas is booked for celebrating.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>89 mins:</strong> Walcott almost adds to the now-comfortable victory when he wriggles clear in the box and forces another full-length save from Jaaskelainen, diving to his left to tip a low shot round his post. Arsenal are now rampant and this one is done and dusted.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> All very simple now: Arsenal sit back and lap up whatever pressure Bolton can exert in a largely token manner. Three added minutes to come.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>And that's that.</strong> There's a talking point over the Davies/Clichy tackle, which has sent the Arsenal full back to Bolton General. But Arsenal win at a canter, and go top. That's all from here. Thanks and bye.</p>",

This is always my favourite moment of my favourite sporting event; each side has shown their colours, but there are enough points left to be won that no conclusions can be drawn yet. </p> <p>At the moment, the momentum is firmly with the US, after they twice overcame strong starts from their opponents to win the opening session for the first time since 1991 and lead the opening day for the first time since 1995. They are thriving on their underdog status and yesterday's play was characterised by determined performances from the hosts and partisan whooping and hollering from a fired-up crowd. <strong>This is going to be great.</strong> </p> <p>So the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf3\">big news </a>is that Europe captain Nick Faldo has omitted <strong>Sergio Garcia</strong> and <strong>Lee Westwood</strong> from the foursomes line-up. </p> <p>That's Sergio Garcia, vastly experienced and wildly enthusiastic Ryder Cup player, three times a winner and with a record of W8 D1 L0 in the foursomes. And Lee Westwood, another totemic player with bags of experience in this tournament and the joint record-holder for most successive Ryder Cup games without defeat. That's a record he shares with Arnold Palmer.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>12.05pm BST Three reasons for Europe to be worried</strong><br><strong>Phil Mickelson is owning it</strong> In the absence of the Other Guy, Lefty has been playing out of his skin so far and is easily the Americans' strongest players so far. Twice he battled with Padraig Harrington yesterday and both times he clawed back deficits to end with 1 1/2 points to the Irishman's 1/2. His putting in particular was superb. with a 70-footer on the 12th perhaps the shot of the day. No European will look forward to taking him on today. Least of all rookie Oliver Wilson.</p> <p><strong>It's all a conspiracy</strong> The alickadoos of the European PGA Tour, concerned that continued tonkings would make the Americans take their golf ball and stalk off home in a huff, have met in the smoking room of a leading Parisian hotel (the USPGA meet in underground car parks) to cunningly engineer defeat for their own boys. Concerned that the American would just stop turning up for the Ryder Cup in order to focus on the shiny new President's Cup instead, the Europeans have chucked out Monty and Darren Clarke and appointed Faldo, a man who can't even get a lunch order in without making himself look stupid.</p> <p><strong>They are not winning</strong> In the Ryder Cup, as in may sporting events, the team with the most points takes the trophy, the plaudits and the girls. Currently that team is not Europe. Over the past two decades, the Europeans have generally led over the first two days, excelling in the foursomes and the fourballs while the Americans bark at each other and snap their putters in frustration. The tie then comes down to how well Europe holds that lead in the singles. This time however, the US take a healthy lead into the second day.</p> <p><strong>One reason for Europe to be cheerful</strong><br>They only need a draw.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.15pm BST While you're waiting</strong> Find out what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf1\">Richard Williams thinks of the whole schemozzle</a> and why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/20/rydercup.golf\">Lawrence Donegan is not warming to Boo Weekley. </a>Have a gander at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf6\">Sean Ingle's morning session minute-by-minute</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/19/rydercup.golf7\">Scott Murray's equally minute-by-minute afternoon report</a> for every pitch, play and USA! of yesterday's play.</p> <p>And speaking of Murray, check out his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.thejoyofsix\">top six Ryder Cup moments ever ever ever</a> and when you are finished, scroll to the comments and tell him why he couldn't be more wrong and that you expected better from the Guardian.

However, that has never stopped me in the past. I think Europe will make another strong start, except in the Mickelson/Kim v Wilson/Stenson match and then go on to hold that lead for a 2 1/2 to 1 1/2 session win.</p> <p>Having said that, expect Lefty to hurl his nine-iron into the galleries after five holes of stinking up the joint and Europe to slump to 5&amp;4 defeats in the other three matches.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.45pm BST</strong> <strong>In the interests of journalistic impartiality</strong>, I should disclose that I am, in fact, a <strong>European</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.46pm BST</strong> <em>taps watch impatiently</em> Where is Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>12.48pm BST</strong> Ah, here we are. And conveniently he is addressing a topic to which I was about to turn my attention.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of hand-wringing over Boo Weekley geeing up the crowd. I find this a bit rich really. Golfers are (correctly) lauded for playing their game very close to, sometimes from within, the spectators, always able to concentrate on the matter at hand. Once the golfer is into his preparation, the crowd must desist from cheering, but until then, the crowd should be free to do what they want short of personal abuse even if the hole isn't yet decided. That's the dynamic of team sport crowd behaviour - the best players turn it to their advantage, home or away.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12.50pm BST Newsflash</strong> Padraig Harrington has an international award for Irish dancing. And Robert Karlsson is not particularly interesting.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12.52pm BST</strong> Boo Weekley and Paul Azinger have taken the most flak for geeing up the crowd, Weekley in particular for doing so before his opponent Lee Westwood had taken his shot. </p> <p>I mean, really. This is <em>America</em>. What did you expect? Rattle your jewellery?</p> <p>Here's Lee Westwood on Boo Weekley (who incidentally is named after Boo-Boo the bear). \"You walk a fine line when you use the crowd to your advantage that way. You can do it by playing good golf, but you can go too far when you are waving your arms around. At the 13th hole I still had a putt for a half \u2013 there's no need to do it between shots, at least wait until you're walking off the green, I don't mind that. The game was slow enough as it was. I thought we were never going to get finished.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.05pm BST \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the second day's morning matches of the 37th Ryder Cup.\"</strong> It's Ian 'Teacher's Pet' Poulter and his good buddy Justin Rose who will tee it up first for Europe and the dastardly colonials in their way are Stewart Cink and Chad Campbell.</p> <p>Today's action will be inevitably be viewed with the omission of Garcia and Westwood in the back of everyone's minds. Way to make yourself inconspicuous, Nick.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose tees up. No pressure.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.06pm BST</strong> Rose lamps it down the fairway. Fantastic shot. Campbell follows suit but is unlucky to see it just nestle off the verge of the fairway.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.10pm BST </strong>Sigh. Commercial break. To be fair to Sky, it is just two preposterously dressed young men walking through a manicured lawn. </p> <p>Gary Naylor, fashionista. \"It's almost impossible to believe with <a href=\"http://www.virginmedia.com/images/lehman.jpg\">form</a> like thisbut the American team is dressed soberly, even tastefully, whereas the Europeans appear to have come directly from an ice-cream salesmen's conference.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.13pm BST</strong> Poulter is 113yds from the pin, on a still morning. Spectacular! He plants it right up there and it so nearly goes in. He's within two feet and gets the concession.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.14pm BST </strong>Campbell has a holeable, but very difficult, shot for the half from just above the green and he does pretty well too, but it's first blood to Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.16pm BST</strong> It's Justin Leonard and Hunter Mahan against Miguel Angel Jimenez and Graeme McDowell on the first tee box now. Never mind Yankee razzmatazz, there is a sizeable contingent of Irish fans there who are easily more boisterous than anyone else. I know they are Irish because they are singing \"You'll never beat the Irish\" and wearing those ridiculous leprechaun outfits. Oh, lads.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.19pm BST</strong> Poulter leaves an excellent drive just right off the fairway, which Cink cannot match. He leaves it somewhere in the next state. That's filth. Ouch. According to Sky's man on the course that is \"the one place you must not go.\" Good chance for the English pair to go two up.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.21pm BST</strong> Leonard's opening drive bounces high off the fairway, over the ropes and .... aaargh. Jimenez is in much better shape. Go team!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.24pm BST</strong> Campbell is now onto his third shot, the Americans having taken a water hazard. He does well, but not nearly well enough given the position of Poulter and Rose.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.30pm BST</strong>Justin Rose lifts it high and clean to within two or three feet of the green. In the other game Jimenez is on the dancefloor, with a reasonably challenging putt of 10ft or so.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.32pm BST</strong> McDowell now to put Europe up in the second match. Oh, so close! Great start from him and Jimenez. In the top match, Poulter and Rose can two putt to win the hole.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.33pm BST </strong>Poulter's line is perfect but he is just short. The Amricans get up and down for a half in the other match, so that's all square.</p> <p>Campbell misses his 10 foot putt and gives Rose the gimme.

And it's a good 'un. A bit too wide perhaps. He's playing with Henrik Stenson against Phil Mickelson and Anthony Kim. Lefty is spot on from the tee. Huge cheers, fist pumps, USA! USA!, etc.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.42pm BST </strong>Poulter from the bunker on the third green, slides it just past the hole. The US boys are in a good spot for a birdie though.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.44pm BST</strong> Cink misses his birdie putt and Rose gets his for par. All square at the third and that was a good escape from Europe to hold their lead. Mickelson is putting from 12ft or so with Europe sitting 4ft closer. He misses, just.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>1.46pm BST </strong>More calls of \"You'll never beat the Irish\" as Harrington and Karlsson approach the first tee, with Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry in tow. And Wilson so very nearly gets the birdie on his very first Ryder Cup hole. He doesn't, and neither does Mickelson, so no change there.</p> <p>McDowell, meanwhile leaves Jimenez a very gettable six foot putt - and he gets it. The US should make par though, and they do.

It's in the trees and all over the place. Dagger eyes from Karlsson as he trudges into the crowd. In a curiously stubborn move, Furyk reckons anything Harrington can do he can do better, and smacks it into the galleries.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong>Cink sits over a right little doozy on the fourth. His lie looks to be sloping down and left. Poulter has a much easier one to follow. And Cink can't quite make it; it's long and wide. Karlsson is lost in the woods.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>1.54pm BST </strong><br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 3UP</strong> (4)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (3)<br>Mickelson/Kim A/S v Stenson/Wilson (1)<br>Furyk/Perry v Harrington/Karlsson (1.50pm)</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.01pm BST</strong><strong> Europe leading in two matches</strong></p> <p>After Cink's miss, Poulter sinks his easily to go three up, and surely Faldo cannot suppress a smug smile at this stage. And right behind them Leonard hits a super chip that sneaks in the back but it's <strong>all in vain </strong>as they have already taken a drop and Europe can two-putt for the win. Jimenez needs them both but the second one is inches away conceded.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.06pm BST</strong> Drat! Karlsson couldn't make good on Harrington's wayward drive, leaving it right. Harrington in turn gives him a long straight put to save the half, but he can't make it. <strong>So the US take a lead in a match for the first time today. </strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.07pm BST</strong> It's a mixture of poor play from Cink and Campbell and storming efficiency from Rose and Poulter, but the latter are now four up. Again, it was the approach shot that let the Americans down.</p> <p>But alas, Mickelson amd Kim are in equally fine form and they are now two up. It's a super putt from Kim on the third that his opponents have no reply to, after Stenson had given Wilson way too much to do on the previous hole.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jiminez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (3)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 1UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (1)</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.14pm BST </strong>Back in the bottom pairing and Karlsson outdrives Perry, both landing square in the middle of the fairway. But the advantage swings back to the US; Furyk takes the wedge for the lofted green and draws the necessary hollers from the crowd before Padraig \"three out of the last six majors\" Harrington leaves his edge shot much too short. Silence from the galleries. Harrington has not so far matched his superb play from yesterday, but it's still early.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>2.17pmBST </strong><strong> Controversy from Naylor </strong> \"Does Kentucky sanction gay marriages?\" I couldn't say, Gary, but I imagine very much no. \"The way the commentators are going on, we can expect Mickelson and Kim to make an announcement any day now.\"</p> <p>And he;s right, they are easily the smiliest pair out there, playing smooth, intuitive golf that only Poulter and Rose can come close to matching. At this stage, it looks like the day will be decided in the other pairings.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm BST</strong> Oh dear. Perry holes a real dribbler, with the crowd blowing it in. That's two up for them and I imagine more dagger eyes for Harrington after he left his partner with a lot to do for the putt.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>2.22pm BST </strong>It's that man Kim again with a birdie putt. You know the drill; perfect lie, perfect putt, fist pump, chanting. He and Mickelson go three up. There are a lot of comparisons made between Kim's putting and Woods' and I have to say it's not too ridiculous a claim. He and Lefty really do look like they are out for a stroll on Captain's Day.</p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (5)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (4)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (4)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (2)</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>2.26pm </strong>McDowell is in trouble, but not terribly so. It's over the brook and onto a sharply sloping green at the fifth. He gets the distance and leaves it just off the green. That'll be par at best for Europe.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2.30pm BST</strong>Harrington and Karlsson get a let-off at the third. They have a similar lie and Karlsson goes first, making an absolute hash of it. But even with the advantage of watching the Swede's lie, Perry drills it down and wide. Still two up for the USA. </p> <p>And there's a kerplunk! up ahead. Cink and Campbell in trouble.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>2.33pm BST </strong>Harrington with the lob wedge from the sand, about 92yds. Very difficult shot after a duff drive from Karlsson. He gets the spin on the back of the green but really these guys need to get it together, and quickly.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>2.35pm BST </strong>That was Cink who found the water (again) and that will surely be five down. Given his opponent's position, Poulter takes no chances and he lifts it to the back of the green, in light rough.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>2.37pm BST </strong>McDowell <em>just </em> misses that par on the fifth. It was a difficult ask from about ten feet and he rolls it around the cup.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>2.42pm BST </strong>Perry makes up for that stinker on the last green with a lovely putt that send the crowd crazy. He needed that after some poor work on the greens all day.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Leonard has taken advantage of McDowell's miss to take par and the hole. In the space of a minute it's two holes to the US and the crowd can scent blood. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (6)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 2UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 3UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (5)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 3UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (4)</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Thankfully for Faldo's men, Cink and Campbell are still shambling about and after six wayward hacks they concede the hole. If the European captain was hoping for his poster boys Rose and Poulter to lead the way for Europe, then they have delivered in spades. <strong>They are five up through seven.</strong></p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.43pm BST </strong>Wilson is down in sloping rough on the sixth but he must be confident of his lie because he simply lamps it up and over across the fairway, from where it rolls back down into a reasonably good position. For Stenson and Wilson though it really does look like damage limitation though, given Mickelson and Kim's brilliance.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.47pm BST</strong>Oh, Padraig! I can hardly look. Another poor drive, and he really is way off the pace compared to yesterday. And given that he only managed a half point yesterday, that really is bad news. It's Karlsson from the bunker and he stabs it up to the fairway, sort of. Best he could do with a horrible lie.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>2.50pm BST</strong> A scrambling half for Cink and they remain five down. But Wilson misses a relatively simple putt at the seventh and that would have been such a confidence booster for the rookie. That would have been for a half, so they are now four down. </p> <p>In an unsurprising turn of events, Karlsson and Harrington have lost another hole, and yet again that was the Irishman's fault. </p> <p>And this is where we're at:<br>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 5UP</strong> (8)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (6)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 4UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (6)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 4UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (5)</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>2.54pm BST</strong> Rose finds the rough from the eighth tee, but it's a gentle kind of rough and Poulter won't sweat it too much. These guys look like they want to be home and hosed by the 12th or 13th. </p> <p>Jimenez is unlucky there, a fine sweeping putt around to the right. That would have won the hole - but what's this! Calamity from Mahan and the US take a six. <strong>That's 2 up to Jimenez and McDowell in the only game really up for grabs right now. </strong></p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.00pm BST</strong> <strong>It's quite a different day from yesterday.</strong> Each match, apart from perhaps the second, is looking won already and there hasn't been a sniff of a chance that any of the strugglers might swing the match back their way. In contrast yesterday saw the lead change hands several times. </p> <p>Naylor has just sent me a simply dreadful smutty pun that I will be forced to print unless i get an e-mail from someone else. <strong>Believe me, it's in your interest.</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.04pm BST</strong> Leonard has a putt to win the hole and take their match with McDowell and Jimenez back to one down. He dinks it home oh-so-slowly, surely toying with his opponents and the crowd. The US are winning this hands down on the greens. And on the fairway. And from the rough, etc and so on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.08pm BST</strong> Oh, hooray! Big PH (as I once heard a particularly obnoxious Portmarnock clubman refer to Harrington, as if he had known him since their pitch and putt days) has holed and Furyk has not. <strong>That's back to 3 up for Furyk and Perry.</strong></p> <p>If Europe are to start clawing back the Americans' lead, they <em>must</em> win this match. Wilson and Stenson have far too much to do. Karlsson had had a respectable season and Harrington is Europe's most highly-ranked player. And their only major winner.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.14pm BST </strong>McDowell hits a poor approach to the wrong side of the green, and Jimenez will do well to leave his partner a simple putt, let alone hole it himself.</p> <p>My successful attempt to jinx Kim and Mickelson has worked, they are in trouble on the eighth.

He needs to get it high and right. He lays up, but Karlsson will take their third from roughly the same spot that Furyk will hit the American's sixth. Furyk does well; the putt for five is definitely on.</p> <p>All square at the ninth for McDowell/Jimenez and Leonard/Mahan. They reach the turn with Europe one up.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.21pm BST</strong> Cink and Campbell were 39 out; four over and no birdies. Yikes.</p> <p>Karlsson and Harrington continue to play safe, Harrington is about 65 yards away and will need the lob wedge to clear the front edge.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.22pm BST</strong> <strong>Quick dash over to Wilson and Stenson.</strong> Following my needless pontification at 3.08pm, the American pair have seen their lead slashed to two holes. Europe took the seventh when Kim found himself deep in rough and couldn't find a way out, and Mickelson's poor salvage effort from a bunker at the eighth gave Kim a tough 15ft putt that he rolled wide. <br><strong><br>And behind them it's more good news for Europe.</strong> Furyk gives Perry a chance from about 12ft, which he takes in smashing fashion. He couldn't buy a putt earlier. But it's a wasted effort, Karlsson holes to cut it back to two holes between them.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.30pm BST</strong> Laurence Slater is not entirely impressed with the European front pair's performance. </p> <p>\"In the midst of the carnage in the first group it seems to me that Justin Rose has actually played quite badly. This is being masked because Cink and Campbell have played particularly badly and Poulter has played really well.\" </p> <p>Well?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.33pm BST </strong>That is the nature of foursomes though; you can carry your partner or drag him down into the stinking mire with you. Poulter and Rose benefit from being close friends and perhaps Rose also benefits from Poulter being a more flamboyant character, taking the limelight his direction. He certainly has prospered from the fact that his opponents are playing absolute gack.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.36pm BST </strong>Of course, we only have their word that they are good friends. For all we know Poulter could drag Rose back to the locker rooms afterwards to administer a series of Chinese burns.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.39pm BST</strong> Whatever the truth, they have just lost the last hole - their first setback of the day - and whatever the result, Ian Poulter will surely brook no more criticism of his selection after a commanding performance today. </p> <p>Cink/Campbell v <strong>Poulter/Rose 4UP</strong> (11)<br>Leonard/Mahan v <strong>Jimenez/McDowell 1UP</strong> (10)<br><strong>Mickelson/Kim 2UP</strong> v Stenson/Wilson (9)<br><strong>Furyk/Perry 2UP</strong> v Harrington/Karlsson (7)</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.41pm BST </strong><strong>The last half hour or so have definitely belonged to the boys in baby blue.</strong> Stenson and Wilcon reach the turn two down after looking like lost children for much of the front nine. McDowell and Jimenez have constantly flirted with skipping back to all square but Harrington and Karlsson look much more comfortable now.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.46pm BST </strong>Jimenez putts from off the green to win the hole but can't quite make it. They halve the 11th. </p> <p>Up ahead, Poulter hits an extremely difficulty chip shot blind to abut eight feet past the pin. Chance of a par.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.38pm BST </strong>It's Cink now on the 12th green, with the chance of hauling Rose and Poulter back further. It's up and left and he can't make it. Rose still has a lot to do to halve the hole and give Laurence Slater one in the eye. He misses and now Cink and Campbell are back to three down. Time for Rose and Poulter to settle and close this one out.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.53pm BST </strong>A ping in the inbox and it's Chris Colman. \"I don't watch a lot of golf but why doesn't anyone create a putter with a spirit level incorporated into the base?\"</p> <p>Get on to Dyson. He's your man.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>3.54pm BST </strong><strong>Wilson and Stenson continue the charge.</strong> Presumably Phil Mickelson is not enjoying the feeling of being the wrong side of a comeback.

He finds the long stuff out behind the left of the pin, but it's not too bad for Rose and given his nasty lie Poulter will be reasonably happy.</p> <p>McDowell and Jimenez will not be though; they're back to all square. The Spaniard could only skid it back into through from a deep, deep bunker lie and McDowell can do better. They concede the hole and their lead.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>4.02pm BST</strong> If indeed Poulter and Rose do collapse - and a missed putt from Poulter at the 13th <strong>means they are now just two up </strong> it would be the first time a five-hole lead has been squandered in the Ryder Cup.

That really is a shame; but to be fair the European pair are only in this position because Mickelson and Kim have been putting on their best Laurel and Hardy impression. All they are missing is a rake and a precariously positioned pot of white paint. </p> <p>If Wilson and Stenson want this they need to up their game in response to the Americans' collapse.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.25pm BST </strong>Poulter is back in the zone now after his screaming fit on the 14th.

He sprayed it off the 14th, missed the subsequent putt, gone back to all square and then set McDowell up beautifully on the 15th for a chance to regain the initiative.

  "<p>In a below-the-belt ruling, a 17-year-old boy spent the night in a Florida jail last week, after he was <a href=\"http://www.wpbf.com/news/17379853/detail.html\">arrested</a> for the heinous crime of wearing low-slung trousers. The trunks waistband they revealed didn't say anything unspeakable like \"I love Sarah Palin\" or \"Abstinence rocks!\"; its mere visibility was enough to land the hapless teenage pant-displayer (who had a past history of dope use, though he was picked up without any) in a cold lonely cell without so much as a change of underwear.</p> <p>As news wires reported (unfortunately often using the word \"crackdown\"), a first-time smalls-baring <a href=\" http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/sep/06/me-speed-trap-gives-way-to-pants-trap/\">offender in Riviera Beach</a>, southeast Florida, could have trousered an $150 fine or been levied with community service, after a law strictly prohibiting \"<a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/saggy-pants-crackdown-begins-in-riviera-beach/1590402807\">saggy pants</a>\" was passed in March this year. Some 5,000 of my fellow American citizens, clearly appalled by the shameless brief-vaunting of insouciant, slouching youth, signed a petition to place the no-hipsters bill on the ballot: and so it was decreed that all local trouser crotches should ascend until reaching their juvenile wearers' loins.</p> <p>But there's nothing in the water in Riviera Beach that isn't also polluting the supplies of several other US cities, which clearly also herald Simon Cowell as their god. If you whimsically decide to flaunt your undercrackers in the town of Delcambre, Louisiana, you could either be slapped with up to $500 in fines, or be given a boxers-soiling six-month jail sentence. Dallas and Atlanta are considering introducing similar laws, while Flint, Michigan also has its knickers in a twist over the non-issue.</p> <p>There is, admittedly, a certain delicious exasperation to the notion that any person over 13 who hasn't learned to pull their trousers up properly is clearly so socially inept as to be beyond redemption, and should be locked away until they promise to stop airing their dirty underlaundry in public. After all, how hard can it be to hoik your jeans skyward until they stop advertising the manufacturer of your briefs?</p> <p>It's an endless modern riddle, but perhaps not one police anywhere should be ruminating upon. In any town which isn't full of people with not enough to do, the \"incarcerate bad dressers\" notion should remain just that: a wearied observation in the vein of \"let's chop off their fingers\" for people who misplace apostrophes. A trouser crotch, however low, has yet to commit a murder. </p> <p>State representative Derrick Shepherd introduced the Louisiana bill, saying, \"Hopefully, if we pull up their pants, we can lift their minds while we're at it,\" which rather suggests that he thinks young people's minds are located between their legs.</p> <p>He and his fellow pant-complainants might console themselves with the knowledge that virtually no post-adolescent woman interprets sloppy streetwear as a sign of male virility; that we don't want to be seen with a man who perpetually appears to have just left the toilet and forgotten to do his belt up. There is rarely anything titillating about the sight of a hairy bottom split or posturing hipbone: they look truly ridiculous, but making them illegal is even more so. </p> <p>Thankfully, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7622793.stm\">Paul Moyle</a>, the Florida judge in the case of the errant 17-year-old, began delivering his verdict (possibly with trousers at half-mast) with a beleaguered \"Somebody help me!\", before railing, \"We're not talking about exposure of buttocks. No! We're talking about someone who has on [trousers] whose underwear are apparently visible to a police officer who then makes an arrest, and the basis is he's then held overnight, no bond.\"</p> <p>And in a scene straight out of a particularly testing episode of Ally McBeal, public defender Carol Bickerstaff added: \"Your honour, we now have the fashion police\", before successfully asking Moyles to declare the law \"unconstitutional\". Thomas Jefferson would no doubt be thrilled to know that he's helped liberate a youth to wear silly trousers. </p> <p>Ironically, had the judge been less sane and ordered that the unfortunate teenager be re-imprisoned, the lad would probably have been forced to follow the usual anti-suicide convention and remove his belt, thereby making the problem even worse. Still, the punishment could have been effective: were he made to share a cell with the inmate everyone else calls \"Bubba\", the reckless trouser-dropper would no doubt have longed to belt up tightly for the very first time.</p>",
  "<p>As the world economy threatens meltdown, Alan Greenspan \u2013 who, as <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov\">chairman</a> of the Federal Reserve Bank,had presided over its fortunes from 1987 to 2006 \u2013 expressed himself as being taken aback by what he described as a once-in-a-century <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/14/greenspan-this-is-the-wor_n_126274.html\">crisis</a>. We were all invited, by implication, to join in his bewilderment at the apparently unheralded disaster that has suddenly struck us. If even Alan Greenspan had not seen it coming, we could all be excused for a similar failing, couldn't we?</p> <p>Well, no. This is a crisis that has been thirty years in the making. Its approaching outline has been visible for a very long time. Only those who did not want to see (and that includes almost all the so-called expert commentators and actors in the drama) could have failed to register the warning signs.</p> <p>The first little alarm bell might have rung when, at the end of the 1970s and early in the 1980s, much of the world \u2013 following the lead provided by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan \u2013 removed <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/09/21/ebon_1.php\">exchange controls</a> and allowed capital to move freely around the world. The result was a huge increase in capital flows as multinational investors roamed the globe, looking for the most favourable long-term, and often short-term, investment opportunities.</p> <p>In one bound, the controllers of that capital had decisively changed the balance of power between capital and governments, whether elected or otherwise. It was now the international investors who could face down governments, threatening to move their investment elsewhere if they did not get their way. The capital flows they controlled were sufficient to dwarf the resources of all but the biggest national authorities. The political agenda had been transformed; the democratic process, which was supposed to protect ordinary people from the predations of capitalism, had been disabled.</p> <p>This is not, of course, how it was portrayed at the time. On the contrary, it was represented as a dismantling of unnecessary and damaging controls. The way was now clear to establish a single global market which, by definition, excluded governments, since any government intervention in that market would mean that market conditions would vary from one part of it to another and it would no longer be a single market.</p> <p>As the external environment changed, so too did domestic conditions. The fashion was now for monetarism \u2013 the mechanistic application of supposedly simple rules for controlling the money supply and therefore inflation \u2013 a process which could safely be entrusted to officials and market operations and removed from the unreliable attentions of democratically elected politicians.</p> <p>Again, these developments were almost universally applauded as an overdue expression of the \"free\" market, not least by those who \u2013 it might have been thought \u2013 would most resist them. Yet, even then, they were not satisfied that they had done enough to shunt off democratic processes to the margins. They determined to ensure that governments were definitively excluded from economic policy by proclaiming that there was only one goal of that policy \u2013 the control of inflation \u2013 and that that task should be removed from those elected to undertake it and handed over to an unaccountable central bank. The principal decisions in economic policy were thereby virtually insulated against public debate and discussion.</p> <p>This, too, was greeted enthusiastically around the world as an inspired piece of Solomon-like wisdom. And, as the inevitable consequences began to take shape, as those who now controlled huge financial assets worldwide and could manipulate them for their own benefit without any fear of interference began to cream off a higher and higher \"return\" and to pay themselves more and more outrageous salaries, bonuses, commissions, and \"perks\" of all kinds, while at the same time making decisions not only exclusively in their own interests but without regard for the consequences for millions of people around the world whose lives and livelihoods simply no longer mattered, the politicians of the day joined in the celebrations. Typical was the New Labour government, which, we were told, was \"intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich\".</p> <p>And, as the banks and financial institutions focused on making as much money as possible through manipulating assets and irresponsible lending, they could relax in the knowledge that the central bank was not only too busy with the task it had been given of shaping economic policy to bother about prudential regulation, but also that it would be too solicitous of the interests of its fellow banks to do anything about it anyway.</p> <p>So, the whole de-regulated international money-go-round whirled ever faster, the music played louder, the champagne flowed faster, and the world economy lurched from one crisis to another. But there was always another tranche of credit, or another clever idea for securitising debt, or another mega-merger, to keep the bubble floating.</p> <p>And then, in slow motion, the souffle began to collapse. As always, it is the victims of the excesses who now have to pay the biggest price for correcting them. It is all those who will lose their homes and their jobs and their living standards and their sense of self-worth who will bear the heaviest burden.</p> <p>In the meantime, poor Alan Greenspan! He couldn't see it coming. Nor could all those bankers, politicians, commentators, financial experts and multinational potentates who so enthusiastically drove it all forward and were so dazzled by their good fortune that they could not recognise reality.</p> <p>But some of us saw it coming. You bet we did.</p>",
  "<p>The conference season in 2008 will be the first conference season in 20 years in which the psychology of politicians and the media is based on the fairly confident expectation that the next government will be a Conservative one. </p> <p>Labour comes to Manchester against an awful background, the worst for a party of government since the Conservatives convened in 1996. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major\">John Major's</a> government from 1992 to 1997 was a tedious procession of failed relaunch attempts and stabs at defining a narrative of what the Conservatives were for, and so far at least the Brown government seems to be following in these footsteps. The conference is a \u2013 slim \u2013 chance to start getting it right. However, sometimes in the past a good conference has set a troubled government on the path to recovery, as with the Conservatives in 1986 and Labour in 1969. </p> <p>Brown government's relationship with public opinion falls into three phases, and ministers fervently hope that the conference will start a fourth, of recovery. The first was the honeymoon phase, lasting over the summer of 2007 and rising to a peak in mid to late September, until it was abruptly ended by the \"non-election\" at the start of October. This led to a sharp switch in public opinion about Brown, and this (and a successful Tory conference) led to a revival in Conservative voting intention and Cameron's personal ratings which took them back to where they had been for most of the late Blair period. </p> <p>Public opinion stayed fairly stable through this second phase which lasted until the end of February 2008. The third phase, of acute crisis for Labour and a large Conservative poll lead, has been in place since March, although June saw the slump that had taken place from March until the local and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/23/crewebyelection08.byelections3\">Crewe</a> elections in May, bottom out. The polls are still bad and Gordon Brown's personal rating at abysmal levels. There was perhaps a slight change of mood during August, as might be expected, as the holiday season calmed politics following the fevered days of July, but September has seen another frightening downturn with the banking crisis and the Conservatives hitting <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5c5a8f62-851b-11dd-b148-0000779fd18c.html\">new highs</a> in the opinion polls.</p> <p>Since March the Labour Party has been in fatalistic mood. This is, I think, partly a matter of political generations. Few among younger Labour people will have experience of a government facing deep unpopularity other than this, and the Major government which went down to overwhelming defeat in 1997. But before this, in 1990, 1985, 1981, 1977, 1971, 1968, 1963, 1957\u2026 governments dipped to alarmingly low levels of popularity and came back from them, sometimes by enough to win. In an <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/Magazine/article.asp?a=3389\">article for Progress</a>, I quote a comment from Richard Crossman, a minister in Wilson's government, reflecting on the apparent hopelessness of Labour's position in December 1968. Yet only a year and a half later, the party was the favourite to win a general election.</p> <p>The fatalism that has gripped Labour is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it generates the \"every person for themselves\" attitude - saving one's personal position - that undermines party unity and in turn creates worse problems. The best hope for the party is to make a proper decision about whether or not to get rid of its leader, and stick to it. There will also have to be a turnaround at least in economic expectations \u2013 the collapse in confidence in people's thinking about future economic conditions took Labour down to its current low ebb. Labour also needs a tough, brutal campaign modelled on the Conservatives' in 1992 attacking an inexperienced and risky opposition party that has arguably not changed enough. But the party currently lacks the money, the self-confidence and the receptive ear from the public to carry it off, and needs to start pulling itself together. </p> <p>Although a leadership coup is possible it is unlikely. More likely is that a consensus will start to form on whether Brown should stay, go later, or be given an ultimatum to shape up. Although there need not be action at Manchester, the strategic decision needs to be contemplated and no doubt it will. Before the conference, it seems that an ultimatum is the most likely route, with a showdown in spring 2009 if there has been no improvement by then in the polls. But moods can change, and movements form, rapidly at conference \u2013 one only has to return to Labour's growing sense of euphoria at last year's gathering in Bournemouth to demonstrate that.</p> <p>Labour will also have to hope for not too many \"noises off\" so that the desired message comes across. The Lib Dems in Bournemouth lost out on coverage because of the more dramatic developments in the financial markets. The last thing Labour needs is for a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4553464.stm\">re-run of 1976</a>, when a run on the pound caused Chancellor Denis Healey to turn back at Heathrow Airport and return to Labour conference and try to calm the financial markets. Healey was heckled, delegates called upon him to resign, and the government had to go to the IMF anyway. Back in those days, Labour conferences were brutal festivals of blood sports as far-left delegates openly baited and denounced their own government's ministers and the language of treachery was on everyone's lips. However unpleasant it might be in Manchester, at least it won't be as bad as Blackpool in 1976.</p>"
