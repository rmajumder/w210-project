  "<p>It was the hottest question in French cinema: how would the enfant terrible of Gallic letters fare at adapting his own novel for the big screen? The answer: not at all well. <br> A lot was at stake for the Atomised author, one of the few contemporary writers from France to make it big in the UK. Michel Houellebecq was determined to film his novel The Possibility of an Island, the parallel story of a stand-up comedian joining a cult and his clone several generations in the future. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-369296507\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/possibility1220.jpg\" alt=\"The directorial debut of Michel Houellebecq, The Possibility of an Island\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>He is said to have switched publishers because the move would offer better guarantees he could direct the adaptation himself. The film would also have been his feature-length debut as a director \u2013 he has helmed a few shorts in the past \u2013 and his calling card in the rarefied world of French cinema. After taking the literary world by storm with his satires on consumerist society laced with graphic sex, why not do the same in le cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais? That now won't happen - at least if the critics have anything to do with it. <br> The Possibility of an Island was slaughtered when it premiered at the Locarno film festival in Switzerland at the weekend, with the author apparently playing hide-and-seek with reporters to avoid further embarrassment.  The premiere \"turned into a farce,\" chuckled French daily Le Figaro, describing how critics sneered and laughed before voting with their feet and leaving the cinema. Outside, they hailed the movie \"catastrophic\", \"ridiculous\", and damned it as indulging into \"bargain-bin philosophising\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-369296508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/possibility240b.jpg\" alt=\"The directorial debut of Michel Houellebecq, The Possibility of an Island\" width=\"140\" height=\"209\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>Swiss newspaper Le Temps retitled the movie The Possibility of a Shipwreck. Early previews held in Paris were similarly harsh, spreading the word that The Possibility of an Island was the \"dud of the season\". </p> <p>A more benevolent reporter from Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds dutifully watched the \"making-of\" of the film as well as the movie itself, but was left puzzled. In the documentary, he wrote, \"Houellebecq defines himself as a part-time human being\" with affinities with robots and mutants. \"This fascination might explain his film aesthetics, which recall 70s sci-fi B-movies.\" <br> The circus in Locarno escalated further when Houellebecq failed to show up at the film's press conference. \"Apparently he got lost while driving somewhere in the Centovalli [valley],\" blogged an irritated Philippa de Roten, culture editor for Swiss television. \"He is as lost as his film. This creature and his movie come from a different planet.\"  Houellebecq did make an appearance later, at the movie's screening for the general public. \"Relaxed, fag in mouth, followed by his wife and dog, [he] arrived ... like a movie star when no one was expecting him any longer,\" said an exasperated reporter from Le Figaro.  Embarrassment? Ineptitude? I suspect that, far from feeling that his glittering cinema career is over before it has started, Houellebecq is secretly enjoying the backlash. It fits well with his self-image: the misunderstood artist rejected by all, rather than the internationally acclaimed, bestselling novelist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-369296509\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/possibility220.jpg\" alt=\"The directorial debut of Michel Houellebecq, The Possibility of an Island\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <br>Ever since Atomised was published in 1999, Houellebecq has been the centre of attention. Critics have either hailed him a literary genius with a dead-on insight into contemporary French society or an egotistical pornographer who includes sex because he knows it shifts copies. His success overseas may well have something to do with this winning combination: the sex-mad Gallic intellectual philosophising between puffs on a Gauloise.  Houellebecq is no slouch at satirising the media in his novels, and it beggars belief that he's unfamiliar with their methods. Playing hard to get makes for better coverage than simply giving a straight interview. Plus he has to combat inherently hostile hacks: many critics may dream of being successful, enigmatic, enormously wealthy writers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-369296510\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/12/possibiluty5220.jpg\" alt=\"The directorial debut of Michel Houellebecq, The Possibility of an Island\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <br>Besides, Houellebecq has a loyal following that look likely to check out what their idol has come up with, regardless of the notices. If it's money that talks, rather than critics, the possibility of another movie from Michel seems strong.</p>",

  "<p>Improvements in national test results for 14-year-olds in English, maths and science have hit a plateau, ministers have admitted. </p> <p>Test results published yesterday reveal that there has not been a significant change in Sats results in the past four years, following a decade of rising results since they were introduced. </p> <p>Headteachers said it was a sign that the \"expensive\" system of testing every 14-year-old in the country, which has this year been beset by a marking crisis, had served its purpose. </p> <p>English results fell by a percentage point to 73% of pupils getting a level five, the mark expected for their age. The drop was fuelled by problems with reading among boys, which ministers said was down to the leap required at secondary school to read the classics. </p> <p>Some 21% of 14-year-old boys failed to register any level in the reading test, meaning that one in five are reading below the level expected for an 11-year-old. Jim Knight, the schools minister, said parents should encourage their sons to read books by introducing them to Jeremy Clarkson and Andy McNab's novels. </p> <p>Science results dropped two percentage points to 71% and maths rose a point to 77%. It means that ministers have missed their target to get 85% of all pupils to the expected level in English and maths by last year, and to sustain that level this year. A second target, for 74% of 14-year-olds to get a level five or above in both English and maths by 2011, now looks increasingly out of reach. Yesterday's figures showed 66% of pupils hitting this target. </p> <p>Knight said that a \"step-change\" is needed to move on from the plateau in results in English since 2004, because pupils who were not reaching the right level were more likely to have special educational needs. </p> <p>Knight said: \"As we improve higher and higher, each extra gain is that bit more difficult for schools to achieve. That doesn't mean I don't think they can achieve that and we've got the right strategies to do so, but each of those gains are harder and that's why our targets are particularly ambitious. I'm not using it to make excuses. We've not hit the 85% target that we want to ... obviously we're disappointed we didn't achieve this.\" </p> <p>Last week's Sats results for 11-year-olds showed many pupils struggling with writing while being competent in reading. Yesterday's figures for 14-year-olds showed pupils performing better at writing than reading. Knight said that research showed pupils were reading less as they turned to computers in their spare time. </p> <p>\"It's quite hard to step up for a lot of pupils from level four to five because they are having to engage with some of our classical authors, writing in a different style of language to what they might use at home, with their friends [or] in school. That presents additional challenges to teachers in terms of how they make that more engaging.\"</p> <p>He admitted that the publication of results for individual schools, as league tables in newspapers, was likely to be delayed following the marking crisis at the American firm ETS. Yesterday ETS confirmed that more than a month after schools were supposed to receive results, 7.2% of English results, 3.4% of maths results and 4% of science results for 14-year-olds were still missing.</p> <p>The delays have fuelled speculation about the possible resignation of Ken Boston, the head of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which was responsible for awarding ETS the contract. Yesterday his spokesman said: \"We will not comment on speculation about something that might happen some way down the line. Until Sutherland reports, nothing is going to happen.\"</p> <p>Lord Sutherland has been appointed to conduct an inquiry into what went wrong at ETS and to assess the QCA's role in it.</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Too much importance is placed on Key Stage 3 tests, which are no more than a progress check two-thirds of the way through secondary education.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Kremlin last night dictated humiliating peace terms to Georgia as the price for halting the Russian invasion of the small Black Sea country and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>Faced with strong western denunciation, President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia called a halt to the Russian offensive and negotiated terms for a truce and a broader settlement with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who, as chair of the European Union, rushed to the region to try to strike a deal on a ceasefire.</p> <p>Early this morning in Tbilisi, Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, signaled his partial assent to the terms, announcing with Sarkozy that he accepted the ceasefire. But Saakashvili raised questions about a continuing Russian military presence in Georgia and the prospects for any durable settlement looked uncertain.</p> <p>\"We do not yet have a peace deal, we have a provisional cessation of hostilities; but this is significant progress,\" Sarkozy said after talks with Medvedev in Moscow and before taking the terms to Tbilisi. This morning Sarkozy predicted Saakashvili would accept Russian terms on the broader settlement.</p> <p>Medvedev branded Saakashvili a \"lunatic\" as he outlined tough terms to the French leader, in effect demanding Georgian capitulation to vastly superior Russian forces.</p> <p>\"The difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them,\" Medvedev said. \"So you have to use surgery.\"</p> <p>The key demands are that the Georgian leader pledges, in an agreement that is signed and legally binding, to abjure all use of force to resolve Georgia's territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local Ossetian forces.</p> <p>Medvedev also insisted the populations of the two regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation that would enfeeble Georgia and leave Saakashvili looking crushed. If he balked at the terms, said Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister: \"We will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous Georgian aggression.\"</p> <p>Russian leaders consistently emphasise that Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture South Ossetia. </p> <p>The gamble triggered the onslaught which the US state department yesterday described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeepers in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared yesterday the Georgians would not return, and South Ossetia would be under Russian control. \"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, ambassador to Nato in Brussels. Medvedev spoke by phone with the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana and told him \"there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire,\" said a European official.</p> <p>\"The Russians are saying that they will never again accept Georgians in any form in South Ossetia. They see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week.\"</p> <p>While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states yesterday, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict\".</p> <p>For months, said European officials, Saakashvili had rejected pressure to commit to forgoing the use of force. But Lavrov said the Georgian army would have to be returned to bases, and that any peace deal would \"require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non-use of force.\"</p> <p>The Russians have also agreed to withdraw their troops from Georgia proper and return their \"peacekeeping\" contingent to positions held before the fighting. But until monitoring of the proposed ceasefire was up and running, the Russians reserved the right to take unspecified \"additional security measures\" in Georgia.</p> <p>While thousands rallied in support of Saakashvili yesterday outside the parliament in Tbilisi, there was a growing sense among many Georgians that his decision to attack had been a disastrous blunder - with Russia's overwhelming response both predictable and highly costly.</p> <p>\"Why are people waving flags? It's not as if we won,\" Lasha Darkveldze, 23, said as supporters thronged the centre of Tbilisi and marched on its freedom square. \"Saakashvili should now resign.\" </p> <p>\"We hope he is going to disappear from Georgia,\" Bacha Janashia, 24, a student, said. \"I wonder why he did it. He has only 10,000 soldiers and he takes on Russia.\"</p> <p>If the Russian terms are demeaning, Saakashvili's bargaining position is extremely weak given the virtual disintegration of his armed forces. Abandoned tanks litter the road between Tbilisi and Gori - dumped following Russia's swift advance deep into Georgia on Monday.</p> <p>In Gori, Russia's ceasefire appeared to be holding yesterday afternoon after numerous air attacks. Russian planes bombed the town yesterday morning - killing at least five civilians including a Dutch TV journalist.</p>",
  "<p>The bomb fell without warning, landing across the road from Tamaz Beruashvili's home. It narrowly missed Gori's town hall and the giant statue of Stalin. But it hit Misha's friend Gocha Sekhniashvili. He had been standing in the main square.</p> <p>\"The bomb came down suddenly. Our windows blew in. Everyone's windows shattered. People were screaming, and dying. Others were hiding,\" Tamaz, 47, said. \"I grabbed our bags and ran. I saw Gocha lying face down in the rubble.\" </p> <p>Russian fighter jets pounded Gori again yesterday morning - for the fifth day in a row. Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev said the \"aggressor\" Georgia had now been \"punished\". But it wasn't clear what Gocha had done to deserve his fate.</p> <p>The strike killed at least five civilians. They included a Dutch TV journalist, Stan Storimans, 39. He had been working near the square's grandiose Stalin museum, built next to the modest two-room wooden home where the dictator grew up.</p> <p>These latest civilian deaths happened just before Medvedev appeared on TV, announcing that Russian forces were halting military operations. Their advance deep into Georgia's west and centre was over, he suggested.</p> <p>On the ground it didn't feel much like that. As Medvedev spoke, a Russian helicopter gunship loomed in the white sky near the village of Nasreti, 12 kilometres outside Gori, and close to South Ossetia, the rebel statelet seized and abandoned on Sunday by Georgian forces. The gunship loosed off several orange-fizzing rockets. They plunged into a line of tall electricity pylons, pluming smoke across the main highway, and along the shimmering mountain valley that links the east and west of Georgia.</p> <p>Along the road were signs of the Georgian army's panicked and ignominious retreat on Monday evening - after Russian troops rolled in from South Ossetia to the edge of Gori. An incinerated Georgian tank lay on a verge. Its roof had been sliced off.</p> <p>Other Georgian military vehicles appeared to have merely conked out during their hapless flight. One tank had two flat back tyres; its crew had left their apples behind next to the gun turret. A pair of military trucks had crashed head-on. Nearby was a dumped artillery piece.</p> <p>Among villagers on the frontline there was bewilderment yesterday at Russia's war with Georgia. \"I don't know which side to blame. I don't even know why this has happened,\" Olya Tvauri, 73, from Nasreti, said. </p> <p>Olya and the other women and children had spent the night in a neighbour's cellar. The men had fled to the mountains, concealing themselves among the fir trees. The Russian bombers turned up at 2am, pounding Gori's post office and military hospital, and killing its doctor.</p> <p>In daylight Olya went back to her vine-covered house with its chickens, plum trees and courgettes bursting into bright yellow flower. \"I'm an Ossetian. But I prefer to live here,\" she said.</p> <p>Others were trudging on foot towards Tbilisi. Russia's feared advance on the Georgian capital hadn't happened. But most residents living along the road had taken no chances. They fled. \"The soldiers told us to go and hide,\" Natela Tlasadze, 41, said, lugging her possessions to the neighbouring village.</p> <p>The cost of Georgia's ill-fated adventure against Vladimir Putin was beginning to sink in. Many blamed Georgia's president Mikheil Saakashvili, asking why he had taken on Moscow, given Georgia's military inferiority and the improbability of US intervention.</p> <p>\"Saakashvili has to resign. There is no other way,\" Misha Iashvili said, stopping to mend his truck next to a roadside cafe. Its owners had gone, locking up and leaving behind their neat dahlia garden. He added: \"Russia has been close to us for years. It will defend us. The US and Europe won't.\" </p> <p>By yesterday afternoon the Russian ceasefire appeared to be holding, with the bombardment of Gori apparently over. </p> <p>A dead dog lay in the road; in the blown-out square a wrecked red Golf sat amid glass and debris. Stalin's statue appeared supernaturally undamaged; the Georgian flag hung from the unoccupied municipal hall. </p> <p>As dusk fell on Gori, two old ladies were trying to hitch a ride out; a fleet of fire engines arrived. </p> <p>\"I don't know whether Gocha lived or died,\" Tamaz Beruashvili said. \"He was covered in blood. There was no time to find out. But he wasn't moving.\"</p>",
  "<p>The temperature in Locarno, Switzerland is touching 30C but French novelist-turned-filmmaker Michel Houellebecq is dressed as if embarking on an Arctic trip. He declines to remove his heavy anorak as he orders an espresso and lights a cigarette, but at least the furry, rimmed hood is pulled down, and his face is visible. A slight figure, he answers questions in a very faint voice, and turns out to be more adept at small talk than his reputation as France's most provocative nihilist would suggest. Last weekend, he cancelled a press conference after critics laughed during a screening of his first film, an adaptation of his novel The Possibility of an Island, and definitely not intended as a comedy. But when we met a couple of days later, he was in a relaxed, almost expansive mood.</p> <p>It is fair to say that The Possibility of an Island is a curious film - a sci-fi movie about cloning, weird religious sects and human life after the apocalypse. There is an unevenness of tone: certain sequences, such as a bikini contest set in a Lanzarote beach resort, wouldn't look out of place on The Benny Hill Show. Elsewhere, the film is more in the spirit of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, or Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, notably the shots of Beno\u00eet Magimel (as a character called Daniel25, the last man alive), roaming through a barren landscape with his dog in tow. The soundtrack features Mozart and Beethoven, and at times the film has an austere beauty; at others, it is reminiscent of an old episode of Star Trek. The critics were not kind. This week Le Figaro's Brigitte Baudin described The Possibility of an Island as \"ridiculous\" and \"catastrophic\", while Corriere della Serra's Maurizio Pollo wrote that it was \"of a quite exemplary tedium\". Others were less damning: the critic at El Pa\u00eds reported that Houellebecq had directed his first film \"with more enthusiasm than results\". </p> <p>The most surprising thing about Houellebecq's debut is that it is unlikely to offend anyone very much. Surprising for his critics, at any rate: Houellebecq says his reputation as the bad boy of French literature was never deserved. \"I can do nothing. It doesn't depend on what I do any more. I don't think critics read my books.\" It's true that, in person, you start to wonder how this rather fey, diffident man has managed to cause so much outrage. He tells me how he wanted to cast his Jack Russell dog in the film, but couldn't because it was too disobedient - not exactly the anecdote of an angry enfant terrible.</p> <p>But why did he want to make this film? Why throw himself into the chaotic and stressful business of translating his work into a very different medium? Houellebecq says he was inspired by certain locations, particularly the landscape of southern Spain. He lives in Ireland, but has a holiday apartment on the Costa Almeria in Andalucia; it was there that he first dreamed up The Possibility of an Island.\"Maybe it is a superficial motivation,\" he says, \"but I always go to the locations when I write a novel. In this case, some of the locations were so impressive that the idea for the film came from that.\" He adds that The Possibility of an Island shares some locations with David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.</p> <p>Making the film was a mainly pleasurable experience. \"I enjoyed the preparation of the movie. I mean, the period immediately before the shooting when you choose everything, all the details. When you create the world. I enjoyed a lot of the shooting, too.\" Editing was a different matter. \"I don't like conflict,\" he says: like most first-time film directors, he didn't enjoy having to argue his case with producers and financiers.</p> <p>Houellebecq's film is disarmingly cast. Cult leader The Prophet is played with such gravitas and sympathy by Patrick Bauchau that it's a while before you realise what a crackpot he is. \"Bauchau has something in him that is to do with sincere spirituality,\" Houellebecq agrees. \"He gives the impression of someone who believes in something that is honest.\" At one stage, Houellebecq considered Michel Piccoli (Belle de Jour) for the same role. Had he gone with Piccoli, the tone of the film would have been very different: \"Piccoli is very ambiguous,\" he says. \"Patrick Bauchau has something pure and naive.\"</p> <p>The film was made for around \u20ac4.5m, not a large sum when you are trying to portray the end of the world. Houellebecq couldn't afford to feature quite as many gadgets as he might have liked; instead, he gets by with showing us a serious-looking man in spectacles, pulling wires and punching a computer keyboard, in an attempt to show us that Bauchau really is being cloned.</p> <p>An enthusiastic sci-fi and horror fan, Houellebecq published a non-fiction book, Against the World, Against Life, in 1991, about the horror writer HP Lovecraft. \"Few beings have ever been so impregnated, pierced to the core, by the conviction of the absolute futility of human aspiration,\" he wrote at the time, implying that in Lovecraft he had found a kindred spirit. Before writing The Possibility of an Island, he did extensive research into cults, even attempting to read the collected works of L Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. \"I tried, but they are extremely boring. I don't understand their success,\" he shrugs.</p> <p>He has mixed feelings about other film versions of his work. He liked French director Philippe Harel's Whatever (1999), a bleak comedy about a misanthropic systems engineer on which Houellebecq collaborated closely. But he is withering when it comes to German director Oskar Roehler's 2006 film, The Elementary Particles, based on his novel Atomised. \"It was a big disappointment,\" he says. \"The actors are good but that, in my opinion, was the only good thing. Technically, it is not very good, the script is not good.\"</p> <p>Houellebecq does in the end remove his gigantic anorak, but the conversation takes a chilly turn when I ask him about his mother, Lucie Ceccaldi. As has been exhaustively chronicled, Ceccaldi abandoned the young Houellebecq to be brought up by his grandmother, and he wrote about her in vicious fashion in Atomised. Earlier this year, she hit back, publishing a memoir in which she called him a liar, an impostor and a parasite. The very mention of his mother makes him groan. When I tell him that Ceccaldi gave an incendiary interview to the Guardian in May, describing her son as a \"stupid little bastard\" and his work as \"pornography\", he says he did not know; if he had, our interview would never have taken place. \"I don't like that,\" he says. \"It is disgusting. I don't like people talking about my private life.\" He adds that, while he may not read what the newspapers say about him, his friends or family do. \"They'll say, \"'Did you read that? It is awful.'\"</p> <p>For the time being, Houellebecq is heading home to Ireland. He used to live in Cork, then Dublin, and is now in the process of moving to County Clare. \"I am always looking for a compromise between a nice place and somewhere not too far from an airport,\" he explains. But even at home, he finds it hard to close himself off entirely from the rest of the world. \"It needs personal discipline not to look at the internet,\" he admits. \"It is human temptation [to read] what is said about you, but you have to resist.\" (Did he really not read what his mother said about him?) There are no further film projects in the pipeline, and he is looking forward to getting back to the privacy of his study. \"I think I will come back to writing for a while.\" Garbo-like, he adds: \"It is good to be alone.\"</p>",
  "<p>The government elected in May 2005 continues to have a parliamentary majority of 63 and still has up to 21 months of its mandate to run. So although the polls are grim, the leader unpopular and the party mood increasingly fatalistic, Labour nevertheless retains the strength and time to do worthwhile and memorable things - providing that it also can summon up the will. \"Something ere the end, some work of noble note, may yet be done,\" is how Tennyson usefully puts it. But what work of noble note might that be? How might Labour's legacy be burnished as its long day wanes? Here, bearing a timely proposal, comes parliament's joint committee on human rights with a new report on the introduction of a bill of rights for the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Some sceptics take the view that the current political manoeuvrings about a bill of rights - of which this week's report is part - are to be feared. They suspect that talk about a British bill of rights is simply a smokescreen behind which this government - or a possible Tory successor - wants to whittle away at the Human Rights Act to appease tabloid editors and anti-European feeling more generally. These fears are by no means entirely misplaced. Both Labour and Conservative politicians have at times suggested that a British bill of rights might give higher priority to national security considerations than the Human Rights Act is alleged to do or that it might discourage the European court of human rights from laying down the law on rights that were set out in such a UK bill. </p> <p>If these were the purposes of a UK bill of rights, then the legal critics would be vindicated and there could be no truck with such proposals. But that is to take too pessimistic a view of the current, often extremely positive, national mood about rights. It also does less than justice to the policy statements on the subject by the justice secretary, Jack Straw, and to those of the joint committee, which consists of MPs and peers of all parties, in its new report. Mr Straw has stated that there is a consensus across the government that nothing about the bill of rights project is intended to weaken the Human Rights Act. He has said that the European convention on human rights (on which the HRA is based) is a platform on which to build. The joint committee is even more explicit: any UK bill of rights, it says, must not just be \"ECHR-plus\" but \"HRA-plus\" too. We agree. Any British bill of rights must extend rights and not restrict them.</p> <p>This is not to say that the government has got this issue right yet. The prime minister, like his predecessor, has a bad tendency to recycle public myths about the HRA as though they were true. He also likes to blur the question of rights and the question of citizenship, which can foster the impression that non-citizens are not entitled to human rights. As the joint committee says, this risks perverting the debate about a bill of rights into a debate about the denial of rights to outsiders rather than using it as an opportunity to define and celebrate what is fundamental about the UK as a nation state.</p> <p>Yet this latter kind of bill of rights would be a prize worth having. A UK bill of rights that extended rights and freedoms - like the right to trial by jury in serious cases, which is not part of the ECHR - as well as broadening them into areas such as equality and administrative justice, while also laying down the nation state's defining values, would strengthen rights and enhance the rights culture. The committee's conclusion that the case for such a bill has now been established is one that should be given a positive response, not met with suspicion.</p> <p>As the committee says, this is a large and serious political project. It could undoubtedly have been pursued better. Nevertheless, all the main parties are, for different reasons, in favour of a bill of rights. That makes this a moment of possibility, not the reverse. The government that got it right would bequeath a great legacy - and might even be re-elected too.</p>",
  "<h2>'Smart' submarine boosts military, says Tehran</h2> <p>Iran's defence minister was quoted by state radio yesterday as saying the country's military capabilities had \"increased remarkably\" since the construction of a new submarine. General Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar reported the submarine to be \"smart\" and unmanned, with radar-evading capabilities. The report did not elaborate on its size and technical specifics and did not say whether the submarine had been tested. Since 1992 Iran has been active in producing military equipment such as tanks, missiles and torpedoes, but little is known about the country's submarines. <br><strong>Associated Press in Tehran</strong></p> <h2>Parents free to name baby Budweiser, but not God</h2> <p>Swedish parents are now free to name their newborns Budweiser or Metallica if they so wish. For decades, the country's tax authorities had banned parents from naming their children after fast-food chains, rock bands or their favourite brand of beer. But the guidelines have been relaxed, according to a tax authority spokesman, Lars Tegenfeldt. \"There is nothing negative about a name like Coca-Cola or McDonald's today. In the 1970s, maybe it was,\" he said. Still, authorities are drawing the line at giving children swear words for names. And forget about God, Allah or Devil. <br><strong>Associated Press in Stockholm</strong></p> <h2>Atomic bombs failed to deter leader, diary shows</h2> <p>Hideki Tojo, prime minister of Japan during the second world war, wanted to keep fighting even after atomic bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a newly released diary reveals. Excerpts from the diary, written by Tojo in the final days of the war, were published for the first time yesterday. Tojo, who was executed in 1948 after being convicted of war crimes, accused surrender proponents of being \"frightened\". On August 13 1945, two days before Japan surrendered, he wrote: \"We now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120%.\" <br><strong>Associated Press in Tokyo </strong></p> <h2>Coup leader gains presidential powers</h2> <p>The military junta that overthrew Mauritania's government last week yesterday adopted a law transferring the power of the presidency to the head of the junta. The law confers the rights of the country's highest office to the army general who led the coup. A statement claimed the coup was brought on by the deteriorating condition of daily life, the president's stonewalling of government institutions and his firing of four armed forces chiefs. The president, Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi, was held hostage one hour after he announced the firing of the generals and remains under house arrest. <br><strong>Associated Press in Nouakchott</strong></p> <h2>Jolie replaces Cruise as lead in spy action drama</h2> <p>The plot was in place: Tom Cruise plays a CIA officer, Edwin A Salt, who is accused of being a Russian sleeper spy so sets out to find the real traitor to prove his innocence. Now, in something of a first for Hollywood, it will be Angelina Jolie as the CIA officer, \"Something\" A Salt. The change of lead actor for the spy action drama, revealed by Variety, came after Cruise pulled out of the movie, directed by Philip Noyce. The choice of Jolie for the part reflects her status as one of the industry's most bankable actors in the role of a backside-kicking action hero. Shooting is due to start next February. <br><strong>Mark Brown</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Guardian is the only newspaper to unveil the extensive intergovernmental agenda on security and intelligence-sharing (Secret EU draft risks uproar, August 7). There may well be some decent ideas emerging from the group of six EU states involved but, as many MEPs have been saying, the EU should not consider sharing vast and unnecessary amounts of passenger, financial and intelligence information with the US without proper accountability or an assessment of what is needed to combat terrorism, organised crime and trafficking.</p> <p>With proper parliamentary scrutiny, it is highly unlikely it would be deemed necessary to transfer 21 items of personal information, including bank and credit card details, every time we make a transatlantic journey, to be kept in the US system for 13 years. This is also the kind of secretive intergovernmental process that the Lisbon treaty would have made more transparent by giving both European and national parliaments more control.</p> <p>Most EU citizens may want greater EU cooperation to tackle organised crime and trafficking, but this can be improved now through the effective use of the EU's security apparatus. The EU police arm Europol is small and underresourced. Frontex, the EU border agency, exists only at an embryonic stage in hot spots such as the Canaries or Lampedusa. Many surveys show that crime, trafficking and terrorism are issues that citizens believe the EU should tackle - radical, secretive decisions which are not scrutinised by parliaments or do not take people with them will ultimately fail.<br><strong>Claude Moraes MEP</strong><br>Lab, London</p>",
  "<p>A recent rally in <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> shares ground to a halt yesterday, as investors reacted to the imminent launch of a significant rival.</p> <p>This Friday Project Turquoise - the trading platform set up by a number of investment banks to challenge existing exchanges - is making its first tentative steps to becoming a fully fledged business, by trading a handful of stocks from the UK and Germany. It expects to gradually build up its systems until it is trading most major shares in Europe by the end of the month. The LSE has already responded by cutting its fees, which will do little for its margins.</p> <p>Other rivals are due to launch later in the year, including a pan-European exchange set up by US group Nasdaq. Among the smaller fully listed and Aim stocks, the LSE is already facing a growing threat from Plus, which claims to have taken \u00a317bn-worth of business from the LSE in the first half of this year. The LSE closed 68p lower at 900p, making it the biggest faller in the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> index.</p> <p>Overall, the market struggled to find a direction, but the leading index finally ended down 7.3 points at 5534.5 after an opening drop on Wall Street. Financial stocks were under pressure after another \u00a31.5bn write-off by JP Morgan and news of the fourth successive quarterly loss from Swiss bank UBS.</p> <p><strong>Standard Chartered </strong>was among the biggest losers in the leading index, down 109p to \u00a314.90 after Citigroup moved its recommendation from hold to sell and cut its price target from \u00a315.25 to \u00a313. Citi said the bank was facing a slowdown in growth and may need to boost its capital ratio by issuing equity. In a separate note, analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland reduced their price target for Standard from \u00a317 to \u00a316.60 but stuck with their hold rating.</p> <p>Overall, sentiment was not helped by worse than expected UK inflation figures and a volatile day for oil. Crude rose by more than $1 a barrel after worries about supply from Georgia, but fell back by a similar amount as worries about slowing demand gained the upper hand.</p> <p>Other commodities were hit by the same concerns, and with copper falling to a six-month low, mining shares were again under pressure. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong>, which this week ruled out any imminent bid for rival <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong>, dropped 68p to \u00a311.66. ENRC ended down 71.5p at 988.5p while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> lost 5p to 528p.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Old Mutual</strong>, whose first half results last week disappointed the market after bigger than expected provisions for its US business, dipped 0.8p to 99.7p. Analysts at UBS downgraded the company from buy to neutral and suggested it needed a major restructuring, including sale of its 51% controlling interest in South Africa's Nedbank. UBS said: \"The sale of Nedbank would unlock the deep value currently trapped within the group as it would focus the business into a purer life insurer, reduce emerging market exposure, and increase investor appetite, resulting in a re-rating.\"</p> <p>Also heading lower after a negative analyst note was publisher <strong>Trinity Mirror</strong>. Its shares lost 9p to 116p as JP Morgan downgraded from neutral to underweight, saying it expected further steep declines in national and regional advertising.</p> <p>Broadcaster <strong>ITV </strong>continued its bid-fuelled rise, up another 3p to 50.6p following suggestions this week that Big Brother producer Endemol might make an offer.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> added 1.05p to 142.35p, despite the Ghanaian parliament throwing its proposed $900m (\u00a3450m) acquisition of control of Ghana Telecom into doubt. MPs, who have yet to clear the government's planned sale of a 70% stake, were called to an emergency debate yesterday amid mounting opposition to the move. Lawyer and former presidential hopeful, Bright Akwetey, has put together a coalition and launched a legal actionin the belief GT is worth a higher price. A minority member of the parliamentary select committee for telecommunications, meanwhile, yesterday warned that the government will not get enough support in a vote, expected today, that is designed to seal the transaction.</p> <p>The government, however, has warned that GT could collapse under its debts if no deal is done. Last month minister of communications Benjamin Aggrey Ntim said GT faces \"total collapse if no drastic action is taken\". Vodafone has pledged to invest $500m in the business. In return the government will inject its fibre-optic network into the venture, a move that has also drawn criticism. GT workers, of which there are 4,200, demonstrated in support of the deal yesterday.</p> <p>Sugar group <strong>Tate &amp; Lyle</strong> rose 3p to 437.75p. But after the market closed, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's revised its outlook on the company from stable to negative because of its high level of debt.</p> <p>On Aim, IT group <strong>Netstore</strong> jumped 7.25p to 31.5p after agreeing a 32p a share cash offer from infrastructure services business 2e2. The deal values Netstore at around \u00a358m.</p> <h2>Not the best advert</h2> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell's advertising and marketing firm <strong>WPP,</strong> in the middle of a hostile \u00a31.15bn cash and shares offer for <strong>Taylor Nelson Sofres,</strong> fell 16p to 487p yesterday after a hefty share placing. Citigroup placed 26m shares at 486p each on behalf of an institutional seller, which represents about 2% of WWP's market capitalisation. WPP faces a rival for TNS in the form of German market research group <strong>GfK</strong>, which called off merger talks with TNS after Sorrell's intervention but may yet return with a bid.

  "<p>Difficult economic market conditions could continue into 2011, Terry Smith warned yesterday as Collins Stewart, the stockbroking firm he chairs, reported an 80% drop in first half profits.</p> <p>The firm, which is in takeover talks with an unnamed suitor, is experiencing a slowdown in its capital markets division which slumped to a loss of \u00a310.5m, compared with a \u00a316m profit a year ago.</p> <p>The division is languishing as companies shy away from raising fresh funds from investors whose appetite for new risk is being hampered by the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"My personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011. These are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen,\" said Smith, who is also chief executive of acquisition-hungry moneybroker Tullett Prebon.</p> <p>The loss in the capital markets arm knocked group profits to \u00a37.1m even though its Hawkpoint advisory business and wealth management operations reported a rise in profits. The firm's fourth division - the securities arm which provides research on 300 large and small cap stocks in the Britain - saw profits fall but it \"performed well\" in the light of prevailing market conditions.</p> <p>Chief executive Joel Plasco has ambitions to expand during the credit crunch and win business from mid-sized companies. He described an opportunity to win broking clients dropped by ABN Amro, recently taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland, and Dresdner Kleinwort, which is being put up for sale by Allianz.</p> <p>Plasco said there were \"significant numbers\" of potential companies that it might be able to attract. The company is also hiring extra staff and is more likely to pursue this route to expansion rather than embark on acquisitions.</p> <p>Neither Smith nor Plasco would comment on the status of the talks with the suitor, believed to be Japanese house Nomura. The Tullett Prebon operation spun out of Collins Stewart is also in takeover talks with US rival GFI Group.</p> <p>Collins Stewart's shares closed down 3.25p at 100p after it halved its interim dividend to 1.3p and appeared to indicate that the second half payment would be lower too. The \"unusual level of uncertainty\" over its earnings had caused the board to cut the payout to shareholders, the company said, although it insisted with \u00a360.3m, its cash position is strong.</p> <p>Smith, who admitted that market conditions could get worse before they improved, said the focus would be on \"conserving cash and cost control\".</p>",
  "<p>The tide has turned against standard assessment tests (Sats). The growing consensus that children are overexamined and that too many schools are drab, joyless, assessment factories has been cemented by the marking fiasco. Reform is inevitable, the only question is: how radical? </p> <p>There are powerful educational arguments against Sats. Tired of the constraints of the national curriculum, more schools are experimenting. For all age cohorts, the system of assessment is now the major inhibitor of much-needed curriculum innovation. </p> <p>But Sats are also suffering from a more general public policy problem. Even if they were ever a reliable indicator of performance, over time they've tended to become merely a guide to schools' willingness and ability to teach to the test. This is a classic example of Goodhart's law - that a measure of performance is no longer a reliable indicator once it becomes a target.</p> <p>Whether incrementally under Labour or more radically under a Conservative government, it is likely that primary school tests will become less intrusive with greater scope for schools to adapt the assessment system to their own needs. This has been prefigured with the \"Making Good Progress\" pilot, where pupils are tested when the teacher judges them ready - not at a single fixed point in the year. </p> <p>But policymakers should not throw the baby of accountability out with the bathwater of over-assessment. The same parents and teachers who rail against Sats will be poring over the stats to see how their own school has done. The middle classes have always found ways of finding out which schools are best and making sure their children get into them. Sats and league tables have at least made this information easily available to every parent. </p> <p>The opinion-formers' critique of public services goes in cycles. Currently the vogue is to attack over-centralisation and the \"target culture\". The government says that the dirigiste methodology of Labour's first two terms was merely a stage on the road to a more strategic centre with light-touch oversight of locally responsive public services. While this correction may be long overdue, the successful management of public services involves different ways of improving them. This means combining top-down systems of accountability, quasi-market mechanisms and the cultivation of a modern public service ethos that is as much about responsiveness and innovation as protecting the interests of professionals and workers. </p> <p>The Royal Society of Arts is at the forefront of an alliance of organisations developing a charter for progressive education. Our partners tend to be passionate opponents of Sats, with one telling a lecture audience that all innovation in schools is by definition bound to succeed in that it couldn't possibly be worse than that which it replaced. Innovators looking up from the classroom crave the freedom to push beyond what currently constitutes good practice. Central policy makers will instead be most concerned, on the one hand, with providing evidence that public investment is achieving results - and, on the other hand, with tackling underperformance in schools, which tends to be concentrated in the poorest areas. </p> <p>Across the public sector the government's answer to this conundrum has been to provide greater freedom to higher performers. This may be logical. It tends to be schools that are secure in their performance that are most frustrated by central prescription and the parents who know their children will succeed at the basics who want a richer diet than the national curriculum.</p> <p>Arguably, however, it is often in those schools with the toughest challenges that innovation is most needed. Disadvantaged pupils need content that is engaging and relevant, but they can find themselves in institutions obsessively focused on avoiding failing-school status. </p> <p>Sats have gone from being a solution to being a problem. The search is on for a system that combines accountability and transparency with the scope for every school to be a place of creativity and invention.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Matthew Taylor is the chief executive of the RSA</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:webmaster@rsa.org.uk\">webmaster@rsa.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>One thing is for sure. This week's operation in Georgia has displayed the failure of the west's policy of belligerence towards Vladimir Putin's Russia. The policy was meant to weaken Russia, and has strengthened it. The policy was meant to humiliate Russia with Nato encirclement, and has merely fed its neo-imperialism. The policy was meant to show that Russia \"understands only firmness\" and instead has shown the west as a bunch of tough-talking windbags.</p> <p>Georgia, a supposed western ally and applicant to Nato, has been treated by Russia to a brutal lesson in power politics. The west has lost all leverage and can do nothing. Seldom was a policy so crashingly stupid.</p> <p>Putin would die laughing if he read this week's American newspapers. The president, George Bush, declared the Russian invasion of Georgia \"disproportionate and unacceptable\". This is taken as a put-down to the vice-president, Dick Cheney, who declared the invasion \"will not go unanswered\", apparently something quite different. Bush says that great powers should not go about \"toppling governments in the 21st century\", as if he had never done such a thing. Cheney says that the invasion has \"damaged Russia's standing in the world\", as if Cheney gave a damn. The lobby for sanctions against Russia is reduced to threatening to boycott the winter Olympics. Big deal.</p> <p>Every student of the Caucasus has known since the fall of the Soviet empire that this part of the world was an explosion waiting to happen. The crisscrossing fault lines of ethnicity, religion and nationalism, fuelled by gas and oil, would not long survive the removal of the Red Army and communist discipline. There were too many old scores to settle, too much territory in dispute and too much wealth at stake - rivalries brilliantly portrayed in Kurban Said's classic novel of Edwardian Azerbaijan, Ali &amp; Nino.</p> <p>In every crisis the west craves goodies and baddies. The media finds it impossible to report a modern conflict without taking sides. In Yugoslavia, where a similar clash of separatist minorities occurred in the 1990s, coverage was so biased that Kosovo is still \"plucky little\" and the Serbs can still do no right.</p> <p>In South Ossetia both sides appear to have committed appalling atrocities, and can thus generate a sense of outrage in front of whatever camera is pointed at them. Georgia's government claimed the right to assert military control over its two dissident provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even if they were openly in league with Russia. Equally, Russia felt justified in stopping the consequent evictions and killings of its nationals in these provinces, in which it had a humanitarian locus as \"peacekeeper\".</p> <p>The difficulty is that entitlement and good sense are rarely in accord. Georgia may have been entitled to act, but was clearly unwise to do so. Russia may have been entitled to aid its people against an oppressor, but that is different from unleashing its notoriously inept and ruthless army, let alone bombing Georgia's capital and demanding a change in its government.</p> <p>What is clear is that the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, is a poor advertisement for a Columbia University education. He thought he could reoccupy South Ossetia and call Russia's bluff while Putin was away at the Olympics. He found it was not bluff. Putin was waiting for just such an invitation to humiliate a man he loathes, and to deter any other Russian border state from applying to join Nato, an organisation Russia had itself sought to join until it was rudely rebuffed.</p> <p>Saakashvili thought he could call on the support of his neoconservative allies in Washington. Tbilisi is one of the few world cities in which Bush's picture is a pin-up and where an avenue is named after him. It turned out that such \"support\" was mere words. America is otherwise engaged in wars that bear a marked resemblance to those waged by Putin. It defended the Kurdish enclaves against Saddam Hussein. It sought regime change in Serbia and Afghanistan. As Putin's troops in South Ossetia were staging a passable imitation of the US 101st Airborne entering Iraq, Bush was studiously watching beach volleyball in Beijing.</p> <p>The truth is that the world has no conceptual framework for adjudicating, let alone resolving, these timeless border conflicts. Where poverty is rife, it takes only a clan war and a ready supply of guns for hostilities to break out. The only question is how to stop them escalating.</p> <p>Once such conflicts could be quarantined by the United Nations' requirement to respect national sovereignty. That has been shot to pieces by the liberal interventionism of George Bush and Tony Blair. The result has reinvigorated separatist movements across the world. Small-statism is not an evil in itself: witness its quadrennial festival at the Olympics. But the process of achieving it is usually bitter and bloody.</p> <p>The west's eagerness to intervene in favour of partition, manifest in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Sudan, is more than meddling. It encouraged every oppressed people and province on earth to be \"the mouse that roared\", to think it could ensnare a great power in its cause.</p> <p>The parallels are glaring. If we backed Kosovo against the Serbs, why not back South Ossetia against the Georgians? But if we backed the Kurds against the Iraqis, why not the Georgians against Russia? Indeed, had Nato admitted Georgia to full membership, there is no knowing what Caucasian horror might have ensued from the resulting treaty obligation. Decisions which in Washington and London may seem casual gestures of ideological solidarity can mean peace and war on the ground.</p> <p>I retain an archaic belief that the old UN principle of non-interference, coupled with a realpolitik acceptance of \"great power\" spheres of influence, is still a roughly stable basis for international relations. It may on occasions be qualified by soft-power diplomacy and humanitarian relief. It may demand an abstinence from kneejerk gestures in favour of leaving things to sort themselves out (as in Zimbabwe). But liberal interventionism, especially when it leads to military and economic aggression, means one costly adventure after another - and usually failure.</p> <p>The west has done everything to isolate Putin, as he rides the tiger of Russian emergence from everlasting dictatorship. This has encouraged him to care not a fig for world opinion. Equally the west has encouraged Saakashvili to taunt Putin beyond endurance. The policy has led to war. If ever there were a place just to leave alone, it is surely the Caucasus.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\"><br>simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Saturday August 16 2008.

  "<p>Dealing with pre-season preparation is one thing, judging the bona fides of the Thai legal system is quite another, but Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, will now have to do both. Skipping bail and fleeing to Britain, the former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra poses fresh problems for the image of British football. If he is convicted as charged by the supreme court in Bangkok on a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, to what extent does Frank Sinatra, as he is known by fans, remain a \"fit and proper\" person to own Manchester City football club? Mr Scudamore will not have to wait long. The court is due to decide in September.</p> <p>Thailand has an extradition agreement with the UK dating back to 1911. Its government is elected - indeed it was the formation of a coalition government composed of the former prime minister's allies in the People Power party that persuaded him five months ago to return home and face justice. Jumping bail was not unexpected. His wife Pojaman had just been sentenced to three years in jail for evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a share transfer deal in 1997. Pojaman was sentenced along with her stepbrother and former secretary. The tycoon's son and two daughters also face corruption charges.</p> <p>Thaksin has given two reasons for his sudden return. The couple said they had faced death threats, and claimed their political enemies continued to interfere in Thailand's justice system. As a result, they said, the court paid scant attention to the rule of law, facts or due process.</p> <p>This may be. British magistrates have shown themselves to be more than willing to reject extradition pleas on the grounds that criminal charges were politically motivated. But if the supreme court finds Thaksin himself guilty, a verdict for which there would be no appeal, the Premier League also faces a legal test. Attached to the Premier League's regulations for the fit and proper test is a whole appendix of disqualifications, including convictions for conspiracy to defraud, obtaining by deception, theft and fraudulent evasion of duty. Reading it, you would be convinced that the owners and directors of football clubs are squeaky clean.</p> <p>The question is whether this is just a pro-forma blessing, a way of concealing bad smells with an incense burner from the high church of football, or whether the fit and proper test is one that is applied at all. If football clubs are to be more than just the plaything of the highest bidder, and an easy way of acquiring international respectability, British courts should pay attention to what happens in Bangkok.</p>",
  "<p>There were sudden surges of excitement like the ones you hear when the bull's horns brush the matador's stomach, and the sort of roars that greet a goal for the home side in the Premier League. Momentary outbreaks of virtuosity were greeted with waving flags and passionate chanting. And eventually, less than halfway through the fourth full day of competition, China's 10th gold medal of these Games was collected by a men's gymnastics team who made a lacklustre start to the final before finishing with a bravura flourish which brought every spectator in the National Indoor Stadium to his or her feet.</p> <p>The hall was packed and it was easy to imagine television sets being switched on from Hong Kong to Harbin. Gymnastics, like diving, is a Chinese speciality. Li Ning, a triple gold medallist in Los Angeles in 1984 and now a highly successful manufacturer of sports equipment, was chosen to light the flame at Beijing's opening ceremony last Friday. And they expect the current generation to make a sizeable contribution to a medals haul that may leave the host nation at the top of the table by the end of next week. </p> <p>Eight years ago the Chinese team flew out of Sydney with 28 gold medals to 32 for Russia and 37 for the US. In Athens four years later they leapfrogged the Russians, collecting 32 golds to 36 for the United States and it seems highly unlikely that anything can stop them celebrating the closing ceremony in the Bird's Nest a week on Sunday with a clear lead to show for their vast investment.</p> <p>The gymnasts had a particular point to prove yesterday. Three of the six-strong squad were part of the gold-winning unit in Sydney and still present when they slumped out of the medals in Athens. Despite that shaming fifth place, however, the selectors stuck by Huang Xu, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng, now aged 29, 28 and 27 respectively, and by the 23-year-old Xiao Qin, who joined them in 2004. Chen Yibing, also 23, and Zou Kai, 20, were making their Olympic debuts this week.</p> <p>It is a team full of experience and individual honours but it began yesterday with a shaky performance on the mat. A nervous Chen was the first to take the floor and saw a red flag go up as he stepped out of the area at the end of his routine, collecting a low score of 14.575 from the judges under a new scoring system that has abandoned the concept of the perfect 10 and instead rewards risk, with a mark of 16 being outstanding. The balletic Yang and the young Zou did slightly better but after the first round of exercises China languished in fifth with Romania, France and the US in the medal positions.</p> <p>The machine-gun speed of Yang and Xiao on the pommel horse raised the pressure without improving the team's standing and it was not until Huang led off on the rings with a composed landing and a mark of 16.000 that the first full-throated cheering was heard. It was redoubled when Chen atoned for his earlier error with a twisting somersault, a planted landing, and a mighty 16.575.</p> <p>Suddenly the rest were going backwards. The chunky Jonathan Horton and the taller Justin Spring did well for the US on the horizontal bar but China leapt into the lead with three vaults of increasing brilliance, culminating in the two and a half twists and full somersault that brought Li to an immaculate landing and a 16.775 mark, the day's highest.</p> <p>The blood seeping from a graze on Li's elbow as he dismounted from the parallel bars indicated the extent of China's commitment, an impression reinforced by the almost unbelievable levels of courage and imagination shown by Xiao and Zou as they conquered space, time and the limitations of the human body on the final exercise, the high bar. Zou's eye-poppingly spectacular landing, feet firmly planted after a thrilling tumble through the air, signed off a collective performance of such impressively growing confidence that it is hard to see how they can be stopped when the individual categories are in dispute. </p> <p>Japan, the defending champions and the winners of this competition five times in a row between 1960 and 1976, took the silver while the US also dropped down a step on the podium, their bronze medals almost forfeited when Raj Bhavsar and Kevin Tan produced dreadful marks of 13.750 and 12.775 on the pommel horse. Their reputation was redeemed by Sasha Artemev with a closing performance of such poetry and panache that he seemed to complete the entire routine without touching the equipment's handles, finishing off with a whirling dismount that brought an ovation.</p> <p>It was Artemev's only appearance of the day but it gave evidence of his distinguished heritage. He was born in Minsk in 1985, the year after the Soviet boycott denied his father, then the world all-around champion, the chance to compete in the Los Angeles Olympics. Injuries ended Vladimir Artemev's career soon afterwards and in 1994, after his wife had left to pursue a career as a rhythmic gymnastics coach in South America, father and son left Belarus for Colorado. They were given US citizenship five years ago. The next time Sasha Artemev climbs on the pommel horse, keep your eyes open.</p>",
  "<p>The road to Rome does not appear straightforward for Rafael Ben\u00edtez but the Spaniard says he will not be distracted from the lucrative prize on offer when Liverpool launch their Champions League campaign here tonight. Given that he reached last season's semi-finals amid division and rancour at Anfield, only a strange few would not take the Liverpool manager at his word.</p> <p>Refused the funds to complete his four-month pursuit of Gareth Barry on the basis that the Aston Villa midfielder does not represent good value for money, Ben\u00edtez begins the new season as he endured the last; at loggerheads with the Liverpool co-owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett, and simmering over the club's transfer policy. With at least \u00a312m at stake against Standard Li\u00e8ge tonight, however, the feuding must wait.</p> <p>Rome, the venue for the Champions League final in May 2009, will always hold an elevated place in Anfield affections because of the European Cup triumphs in the Stadio Olimpico of 1977 and 1984. The motivation for a hat-trick may be less romantic for Ben\u00edtez than the club's fans, shaped as it is by financial necessity and the welcome distractions the competition has provided throughout his Liverpool reign, but the ambition remains the same.</p> <p>\"Even if we signed a player today he could not play against Standard Li\u00e8ge so I am not worried about that situation. I am only concentrating on the game,\" the Liverpool manager said last night. \"I am really calm about the situation. I don't have any problems. I am not distracted. I am focused only on this game.\"</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez is prepared to play Xabi Alonso against Li\u00e8ge even though a Champions League appearance could affect his transfer value, although no club is currently prepared to meet Liverpool's asking price and, with Javier Mascherano and Lucas at the Olympics, and Barry in limbo, his options in central midfield are limited.</p> <p>The prospect of Fernando Torres and Robbie Keane playing together for the first time in a competitive fixture has encouraged Ben\u00edtez's optimism not only for tonight but for the entire Champions League campaign. \"They have not played together much so far and it will take time but as a partnership they can be as good as anyone in this competition,\" he said. </p> <p>The Spaniard pledged to field his strongest possible team against the champions of Belgium and will give a late fitness test to Steven Gerrard as the Liverpool captain recovers from a thigh strain suffered against Valerenga last week. \"He is progressing really well but we will check after training,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"I will also speak to the doctor and to Steven before making a decision about whether he is ready to play.\"</p> <p>Liverpool travelled to Belgium without the injured Martin Skrtel, Fabio Aur\u00e9lio and Philipp Degen while Steve Finnan was also left behind on Merseyside despite being fit to face Li\u00e8ge. The former Republic of Ireland defender is believed to have fallen out with Ben\u00edtez over the manager's intent to sell him this summer, either as a makeweight in a deal for Barry or as a means to raise funds to sign the Villa captain, and his omission is a further indication of how he has been marginalised at Anfield. \"We have [Alvaro] Arbeloa and, if we have any problems, we can put Carra [Jamie Carragher] on the right,\" Ben\u00edtez said dismissively.</p> <p>The manager is refusing to give up hope of signing Barry and would not have to rely on a short-term loan from his American employers if he raised more revenue through player sales. The striker Andriy Voronin is also surplus to requirements in Ben\u00edtez's eyes but, unlike Finnan, he will be involved in Belgium following an encouraging pre-season. The 29-year-old, signed on a free transfer from Bayer Leverkusen last year, has also revealed his preference is to remain at Liverpool and prove his many doubters wrong.</p> <p>\"I have had a great pre-season run and am the fittest I have ever been. I am really looking forward to this season and know I can do a job for the team,\" said Voronin, who will be on the bench tonight if Ben\u00edtez elects to field Torres and Keane together for the first time in a competitive game. \"It's not going to be easy for me but I am up for the fight and am working very hard. My English has improved and I have settled well in Liverpool. Now I need the chance to prove my quality.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England's interest rates dilemma intensified yesterday after the latest Government figures showed that sharp rises in the cost of food and fuel pushed the annual inflation rate to a 16-year-high of 4.4% last month and left it on course to hit 5% in autumn.</p> <p>Despite signs that the credit crunch has led to a slowing in the economy, data from the Office for National Statistics showed a 0.6 point jump in the annual cost of living in July - the biggest one-month jump since Labour came to power more than a decade ago.</p> <p>The ONS said food and fuel prices were rising at their fastest pace since the early 1980s. A 20% increase in the price of milk, a 40% increase in the cost of eggs and a 41% increase in the price of a sliced white loaf contributed to the rising cost of the weekly shop, up by almost 14% over the past year. Food accounted for half the July jump in inflation, with dearer meat the most important factor.</p> <p>Over the past six months inflation as measured by the government's consumer prices index has doubled and, after rising from 3.8% in June, now stands at more than twice its 2% target. Other measures of the cost of living also rose last month, with the retail prices index measure of inflation - the benchmark for many pay deals - up from 4.6% to 5%.</p> <p>Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had to write a letter to Alistair Darling in June explaining why inflation was more than a percentage point above its target and will have to write again next month. The Bank has said global trends beyond the control of its nine-strong monetary policy committee have been responsible for the rise in inflation and has left the cost of borrowing at 5% since April after three quarter-point cuts in the preceding five months.</p> <p>The City - taken aback by the size of July's increase - said the Bank's monetary policy committee now had to decide whether to adopt a no-risks approach by raising the cost of borrowing or hope that a slowing economy and lower commodity prices would bring the cost of living back towards its target during 2009.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, economist at Citi, said today's Inflation Report - the Bank's quarterly health check on the economy - was likely to make \"grim reading\", with Threadneedle Street arguing that a pronounced slowdown in growth was needed to bring inflation back under control. \"There is little chance the MPC will cut rates in the next few months and, indeed, there remains a near-term risk that the MPC will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again.\"</p> <p>Some City analysts have taken comfort in recent months that so-called core inflation - a measure of the cost of living that strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco - had remained weak, suggesting that higher costs of fuel and food were not feeding through into price increases across the whole economy. </p> <p>Last month, however, core inflation rose from 1.6% to 1.9%. </p> <p>Vicky Redwood, of Capital Economics, said: \"The rise in core inflation will clearly leave the MPC concerned that even the sharp slowdown in activity now under way will not be severe enough to prevent a more broad-based pick-up in inflation. While we still think that the MPC could cut interest rates before the end of the year, a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda. Indeed a rate rise is still a possibility.\"</p> <p>The inflation figures prompted criticism of the government from opposition parties. The Conservative leader, David Cameron, said: \"The most important concern up and down the country is the deteriorating state of our economy. Hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them, businesses are cutting back, unemployment is creeping up and this morning's inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet.\" </p> <p>Vince Cable, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"It's very clear that we're in for a dose of stagflation, with the economy slowing abruptly and inflation too high and increasing.\" </p> <p>The Treasury chief secretary, Yvette Cooper, said the government was cutting taxes by \u00a34bn to mitigate the effects of the global downturn but said there was a limit to what the government could do in the face of rising commodity prices. \"I think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate, whether it is households or businesses, from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen.\"</p> <p>ONS figures showed that other countries have also been affected by rising inflation, with the average for the countries of the eurozone more than doubling from 1.8% to 4.1% between July 2007 and July 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Each month, the smartest economists in the City produce a forecast for inflation ahead of the release of the official government data. And in every month since the spring, they have got it wrong, consistently underestimating the extent to which rising prices have been pushing up the cost of living. The expectation was that the annual inflation rate would jump from 3.8% to 4.2% last month; in the event, it climbed to 4.4%.</p> <p>The bad news is likely to continue once increases in domestic gas and electricity bills feed through into the inflation figures for August. Lower petrol prices will help keep inflation in check, but will be insufficient to prevent inflation moving even further away from its 2% target during the next few months. The City believes it is on course to peak at 5% but on past form, it could be higher than that.</p> <p>As inflation has moved higher, so the public's expectation of what will happen to the cost of living in the future has risen. That reflects both what has been happening to prices and the widely held belief that inflation is a lot higher than the official figures suggest. Government statisticians say the data is solid. Over the past 12 months, however, it has been the goods that are purchased most regularly - such as food and petrol - that have seen the sharpest price increases. People know that margarine is 50% dearer than it was in July 2007 because they buy it every week; they tend to buy computers - down 20% on a year ago - much less frequently.</p> <p>What happens next depends on how businesses and pay bargainers behave. Companies have seen hefty increases in their costs over the past year and are trying to pass them on to their customers. Workers are seeing their living standards fall because inflation is rising at a more rapid pace than earnings. The Bank of England's message is that if firms accept lower profit margins this year and wage negotiators accept a real pay cut, then inflation will start to fall in 2009 as the impact of this year's rise in commodity prices ceases to have an upward effect on the cost of living.</p> <p>If this warning is heeded, the City believes the Bank will leave interest rates where they are for now and start cutting them late this year or early next. If it is not, the Bank will push up the cost of borrowing to maintain its anti-inflationary credibility even if that means a deeper and longer slowdown in the economy.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Bill Cotton, who has died aged 80, was managerially responsible for many of the BBC's most loved and enduring programmes in its 1960s and 70s golden age of comedy. He was unusual in being a broadcasting executive who rose almost to the pinnacle of the corporation with a background in show business rather than the grimmer-faced bureaucracy of news and current affairs.</p> <p>As the son of the popular bandleader Billy (\"Wakey, wakey!\") Cotton, he had grown up close to the centre of show business life. His appointments as head of light entertainment (1970-77), then controller of BBC1 (1977-81) and finally managing director of television (1984-88) were welcomed by a wide range of talent because, unlike many of his predecessors, he was visibly open to drama and light entertainment values. </p> <p>His greatest achievements were as head of light entertainment, during which time he discovered or developed the skills of Bruce Forsyth, Dave Allen, Michael Parkinson, Cilla Black and Morecambe and Wise, brought Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corber together as The Two Ronnies, and promoted such shows as Monty Python's Flying Circus, Dad's Army and many others. Later, he brought Michael Grade to the BBC as controller of BBC1, only to be disappointed when Grade left after four years for Channel 4. His other sadness was said to be losing Eric Morcambe and Ernie Wise to ITV in 1978.</p> <p>Cotton was one of the most genial and least faceless top executives; in an age when the BBC had more than 20,000 staff, employees found him as friendly and direct with the cleaning ladies as he was with fellow department heads. He also transparently liked creative people and the front men he employed. Once when being ribbed on air by Terry Wogan, he responded by sitting on the chatshow host's lap and kissing him - a gesture way over the top by BBC standards, but revealing a controlled flamboyance that could be wheeled out when it suited his purpose.</p> <p>Cotton's background was as respectable as any bandleader's son's could be. Born in London, he was a boarder at Ardingly college, west Sussex, and did his national service in the Royal Army Service Corps. After working in the music division of Chappells, he went to the Michael Reine Music Company as joint managing director (1952-56). His father had dinned three things into him: know what you are doing, work very hard at it and have a lot of luck.</p> <p>He joined the BBC as a trainee light-entertainment producer in 1956, working on hows such as Six-Five Special. The previous year he had taken over his father's Billy Cotton Bandshow for a broadcast after Cotton Sr suffered a temporary nervous collapse. Bill used his father's voice but some of his own humour, and his appearance was praised. Once he was in the BBC, he produced more than 80 editions of his father's show, which in a sense heralded the changes that were to come. In the hands of Cotton Sr, who was never afraid to blow a raspberry at the toffs, the show was already more irreverent than most popular entertainment.</p> <p>To the younger Cotton, producing his father's shows was a lesson in staying in control. It also opened up to him a contacts book of show business names in both Britain and the US. But he was always determined to promote British stars for British television, which he did later with Val Doonican as a European equivalent of the American singer Perry Como. Likewsie, when he gave Cilla Black her chance, he defended the move by saying he saw her as a version of Gracie Fields rather than the American Barbra Streisand. He once boasted that in the 15 years he had been with BBC light entertainment, the Americans Como, Dick Van Dyke and Lucille Ball had disappeared from the schedules. </p> <p>The early 1980s saw Cotton's career apparently in the doldrums as he was shuffled into a job masterminding the BBC's involvement in direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), which turned out to be a non-involvement. But in 1884 the abrupt removal of Aubrey Singer as managing director of a BBC-TV service losing ground to ITV gave Cotton his chance as his successor. He soon brought in Grade, a former ITV man but a kindred spirit, first as controller of BBC1 and then as director of programmes. The two men started to win back lost ground - partly through the launch of EastEnders.</p> <p>Cotton's career, unlike that of most BBC top brass, did not end with his departure from the corporation at 60, the regulation age of retirement. After leaving in 1988, he went on to head the television arm of the Noel Gay Agency, as chairman of Noel Gay Television (1988-97), luring the presenter Sue Lawley, for instance, to ITV when her BBC career appeared to be in the doldrums. He arranged a deal worth \u00a3350,000 while simultaneously keeping her in her prestigious BBC radio Desert Island Discs slot - a feat typical of his avuncular brand of diplomacy. He was also chairman of Meridian Broadcasting from 1996 to 2001. He was made a CBE in 1989 and knighted in 2001.</p> <p>His chum Grade once described Cotton as a very clever negotiator who always told artists the truth about themselves, a man who was intelligent if no intellectual, intuitive and wise, unselfish and, strikingly, perhaps not ambitious enough on his own behalf. It was certainly true that Cotton could have made more money had he accepted one of the share-adorned offers made to him at various times by ITV. But the truth was that he was simply more interested in programme and personal distinction than in greed. </p> <p>Outside the broadcasting bubble, Cotton was a golfer, a magistrate and vice-president of Marie Curie Cancer Cure. He was married three times, first, in 1950, to Bernadine (known as Boo) Sinclair, who died of cancer in 1964; in 1965, to Ann Henderson, from whom he was divorced in 1989; and in 1990, to Kate Burgess, whom he had met while they were sitting as magistrates at Richmond upon Thames, Surrey. Both resigned from the bench amid a BBC-bashing campaign by some tabloid newspapers. Kate survives her husband as do the three daughters of his first marriage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> William Frederick \"Bill\" Cotton, broadcasting executive, born April 23 1928; died August 11 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday August 13 2008 to correct the misspelling of Ronnie Corbett's surname.</p>",
  "<p>A former senior civil servant who was responsible for coordinating the government's anti-drugs policy now believes that legalisation would be less harmful than the current strategy. Julian Critchley, the former director of the Cabinet Office's anti-drugs unit, also said that his views were shared by the \"overwhelming majority\" of professionals in the field, including police officers, health workers and members of the government.</p> <p>He also claimed that New Labour's policy on drugs was based on what was thought would play well with the Daily Mail readership, regardless of evidence of what worked. Downing Street policy advisers were said to have suggested stunts such as sending boats down the Thames to catch smugglers to coincide with policy announcements. </p> <p>Critchley - not be to be confused with the late Tory MP of the same name - was director of the UK Anti-Drug Coordination Unit in the Cabinet Office, with the job of coordinating government policy across departments and supporting the then drugs Tsar, Keith Hellawell. In a contribution to the debate on the \"war on drugs\" on a BBC website, Critchley spelled out his reasons for now supporting legalisation and claimed the government's position is hypocritical. Yesterday Critchley, who is now a teacher, confirmed that the blog posting accurately conveyed his views. </p> <p>\"I joined the unit more or less agnostic on drugs policy, being personally opposed to drug use, but open-minded about the best way to deal with the problem,\" he wrote on the blog. \"I was certainly not inclined to decriminalise. However, during my time in the unit, as I saw more and more evidence of 'what works', to quote New Labour's mantra of the time, it became apparent to me that ... enforcement and supply-side interventions were largely pointless. They have no significant, lasting impact on the availability, affordability or use of drugs.\"</p> <p>He said that his views were widely held in the government but rarely expressed in public. \"I think what was truly depressing about my time in UKADCU was that the overwhelming majority of professionals I met, including those from the police, the health service, the government and voluntary sectors held the same view: the illegality of drugs causes far more problems for society and the individual than it solves. Yet publicly, all those intelligent, knowledgeable people were forced to repeat the nonsensical mantra that the government would be 'tough on drugs', even though they all knew the government's policy was actually causing harm.\"</p> <p>Critchley believed that the benefits to society of the fall in crime as a result of legalisation would be dramatic. \"Tobacco is a legal drug, whose use is declining, and precisely because it is legal, its users are far more amenable to government control, education programmes and taxation.\" Anyone who wished to purchase the drug of their choice could already do so. \"The idea that many people are holding back solely because of a law which they know is already unenforceable is simply ridiculous.\"</p> <p>His intervention was welcomed yesterday by drugs law reformers. \"Julian Critchley is one of the brave few to tell the truth about the failure of prohibition and the need to replace it with a system of regulation,\" said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. \"It is truly shameful that there are so many more who know that the war on drugs is overwhelmingly counterproductive, and yet continue to remain silent, tacitly endorsing a policy that they know creates misery, degradation and death for millions across the globe.\"</p>",
  "<p>Even before the fighting that claimed so many lives, Tskhinvali, the putative capital of South Ossetia, was a pretty miserable place. Stalin Street (really) was its one and only proper thoroughfare; it had a tiny market with a couple of old women selling vegetables and batteries, and billboards celebrating eternal Ossetian-Russian friendship. A couple of miles away, bored Georgians soldiers sat keeping warm around a brazier. </p> <p>When I visited it a few months ago, South Ossetia seemed like the end of the world, not the place that would spark a new war in the Caucasus. It was one of the four so-called \"frozen conflicts\" of the former Soviet Union and, as it had been for years, still very much in the deep freeze.</p> <p>The mood was not much different in Sokhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, to the west. This city by the Black Sea, much of which remains in ruins from the war of the early 1990s, was once the holiday playground of the Soviet elite. Now old men played chess under gently swaying palms in front of wrecked hotels, and I visited a memorial for the Abkhaz soldiers who had died fighting the Georgians. At the Inguri river, where you crossed from Georgia proper, the Georgians had erected a sculpture of a huge pistol pointing north to Abkhazia - but in a futile gesture the barrel had been tied in a knot.</p> <p>South Ossetia and Abkhazia both broke away from Georgia in savage fighting when the Soviet Union disintegrated. The other two \"frozen conflicts\" in this region are Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave wrenched from Azerbaijan, and Transnistria, whose Slav population rebelled against Moldova, whose people and language are closely related to Romania. All are the unhappy legacies of Stalinist map-making, lines drawn in a period when the wishes of people counted for little and the demise of the Soviet Union was beyond imagination. All are unrecognised but exist as de facto states, albeit with support from Russia and, in Nagorno-Karabakh's case, Armenia.</p> <p>Take South Ossetia, which like Abkhazia had autonomous status within Soviet Georgia. Although many South Ossetians live in Tbilisi and elsewhere in Georgia, its people are really connected in terms of family, kin and language with North Ossetia, which is now in Russia, across the mountains to which it is connected through the Roki tunnel.</p> <p>Ossetians speak a language related to Persian and believe (truly) that the King Arthur of British myth was actually an Ossetian. I found billboards in Tskhinvali emblazoned with pictures of men dressed as knights in armour celebrating the 17th anniversary of South Ossetia's declaration of independence.</p> <p>Its population is tiny - somewhere between 22,000, as the Georgians claim, and 70,000, according to the South Ossetians. The numbers vary not least because, as there is no work (and no university) in South Ossetia, many go to Russia and only come home for the holidays.</p> <p>Even before last week, South Ossetia was hardly a candidate to be a viable state, especially as large swathes of it - as much as a third - were held by the Georgians. Only 800 metres separated the centre of one Georgian-controlled village from Tskhinvali. The Georgians had recently built a brand new cinema and sports complex in that village, and roads and infrastructure were being upgraded. </p> <p>The head of the Georgian administration for South Ossetia was a burly former military man who had defected from the separatists. He cut little ice in Tskhinvali, where officials scoffed at his notion of striking a deal and making peace with Georgia. Indeed, their plans were rather more ambitious.</p> <p>\"Our aim is unification with North Ossetia,\" Alan Pliev, the deputy foreign minister of South Ossetia, told me in his broom cupboard of an office. \"We don't know if that would be as part of Russia or as a separate united Ossetian state.\" Juri Dzittsojty, deputy speaker of parliament, says: \"I would prefer there to be an independent and united Ossetia, but today it is not possible. It is safer to be with Russia. The main aim of the struggle is to be independent of Georgia.\"</p> <p>A few hours' drive away, along the road now cut by Russian troops, the Abkhaz dream was a different one. Their goal is simply to hang on to what they have got. And here's the rub. Before the Abkhaz war of the early 1990s, less than 18% of its population were ethnic Abkhaz. Today, of some 200,000 people, this group still constitutes only 45% of its people, and hundreds of thousands of Georgians who left Abkhazia in the 1990s want to return home. The Abkhaz, who are in firm control of the government and of all levers of power, argue that to allow more of these refugees back than they have already permitted would simply be to turn back the clock and to make the Abkhaz once more a small minority in their own homeland.</p> <p>In the foreign ministry of the unrecognised republic I waited to see Maxim Guinja, Abkhazia's deputy foreign minister. Then he came out, and before we talked he tidied away some flags in the waiting room. There had just been a meeting in Sokhumi of the leaders of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria.</p> <p>\"We became 18% because of Soviet rule and Russian before that,\" he explained. Abkhaz were deported to Siberia and Turkey, and Georgians settled here. \"My grandfather was put on a train in 1937 with thousands of others, and the next day a train arrived with Georgian settlers. No one returned from Siberia.\" His dream is that one day hundreds of thousands of Abkhaz - or rather their descendants who fled the Tsarist invasion to Turkey in the late 19th century - will come home. A pipe dream? Maybe, but Guinja said that he had a very clear precedent in mind. Israel did it, so why not Abkhazia?</p> <p>In the meantime, the Abkhaz have to play gingerly with the Russians, whom they distrust as much the Ossetians trust them. \"For Russia, Abkhazia is just a card that can be played,\" I was told by Leyla Taniya, who runs a thinktank in Sokhumi. \"Abkhazia is linked to Russia, and Russia is the only country that actually cooperates with Abkhazia, and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption.\" She wants to correct a \"common misunderstanding\" in the west: despite its small size, Abkhazia \"is not a Russian puppet\".</p> <p>It is easy to comprehend why such a misunderstanding should exist. The Abkhaz, like the South Ossetians, have all been given Russian passports and vote in Russian elections, even though their unrecognised statelets are legally part of Georgia. They use the rouble, their people work and study in Russia and they speak Russian at least as much as Abkhaz or Ossetian. Their elderly receive their pensions from Russia. And, as the last few days have helped demonstrate, without Russian military support, it is doubtful whether the breakaways would still exist.</p> <p>Yesterday, Abkhazia began a military operation to take back a strategic sliver of territory held by the Georgians within Abkhazia. They could do this because Russian troops had struck far outside Abkhaz territory, routing the Georgian forces. No wonder everyone was so relaxed when I was in Sokhumi. I went to see Stanislav Lakoba, the Abkhaz official in charge of security. Georgia, I put it to him, was pouring 10% of its GDP into its army, was bidding to join Nato, had intensely courted the US and was demanding that Russia pull its so-called peacekeeping troops out of Abkhazia, 14 years after their deployment. \"Georgia just screams about it,\" he said laconically. \"It would just mean suicide if they attacked.\" He obviously knew what he was talking about.</p> <p>Despite its massive military support for the breakaways, the curious thing is that Russia does not actually want their full secession. It is a case of, \"Listen to what I say, not what I do.\" After battling separatists in Chechnya and beyond for well over a decade, Moscow is afraid of anything that might set a precedent and encourage the break-up of the Russian Federation. It is not the only big power with such concerns: China is nervous about anything that might boost separatist hopes in Tibet or Xinjiang, let alone Taiwan.</p> <p>This year the argument over breakaways and precedents has reached fever pitch, and the reason for that is Kosovo. On February 17, Kosovo, which has a population of some two million, 90% of whom are ethnic Albanians, declared independence from Serbia. Serbia of course rejects its independence, as does Russia, China and indeed the majority of countries in the world, including Georgia. Twenty out of 27 EU states have recognised it, however, alongside the US and other western countries. But in doing so these 45 states seem to have crossed a legal Rubicon. Until then, the only new states in Europe had been the six republics of the old Yugoslavia, such as Croatia or Bosnia, the 15 former Soviet republics and the Czech and Slovak republics. Kosovo is different. Like the four post-Soviet breakaways, it was a province or part of an existing republic. So, argued Serb leaders, it did not have the same right to independence as the republics did. \"Yes, we do,\" argued the Kosovo Albanians. Their struggle, they argued, was based on the legal right of a people to self-determination - just like the Serbs argued in 1991 when they briefly set up a breakaway republic of Krajina in Croatia.</p> <p>Quite simply then, in Kosovo as in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two pillars of international law - that is to say, the territorial integrity of states versus self-determination - stand in stark opposition to one another.</p> <p>Hence Russia's refusal to back Kosovo's independence. \"The threat of a disintegrating Russia - comparable to the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 - is still today seen as a very real threat by the Kremlin and the Russian elite,\" says Pavel Felgenhauer, a leading Russian commentator. \"The west is seen today by many in the Russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear Russia apart and rob it of its natural resources. By supporting Serbia's right to veto Kosovo's secession, the Kremlin clearly believes that it is defending Russia's undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available.\"</p> <p>Of course, Russia is interested in its territorial integrity, not Georgia's. By supporting Abkhazia and South Ossetia, it has the means to keep Georgia at its mercy and prevent it from following the pro-western path chosen by its electorate. But beyond that, it has little real interest in the breakaway states. Where the EU has poured billions into the reconstruction of Sarajevo and other Balkan cities ruined by wars of the 1990s, Russia has spent not a kopek in rebuilding Sokhumi or Tskhinvali.</p> <p>In September, Serbia will ask the General Assembly of the United Nations to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hand down an advisory opinion on whether Kosovo's declaration of independence was legal or not. If this ever happens, the ruling could have tremendous impact - or not, as the case may be. If Kosovo's 1.8 million people can declare independence and be recognised without the permission of Serbia, then so can Abkhazia or South Ossetia, to say nothing of the Republika Srpska (the Serb part of Bosnia), Iraqi Kurdistan and - who knows? - one day perhaps even Catalonia or the Basque country. </p> <p>On the other hand, the ICJ could declare that Kosovo's declaration was indeed illegal - and then what? Not much, probably. In 1975, the ICJ ruled that the people of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara had the right to self-determination. This was disputed by Morocco, which had occupied the country. Now, 34 years later, Morocco, a good friend of the west, is still occupying Western Sahara, most of the population has been driven out and lives in miserable camps in the Algerian Sahara, and the Moroccans have built a wall around the country to keep separatist guerrillas out. No one outside the region cares a hoot about them because, when it comes to these types of conflicts, hypocrisy is everyone's order of the day.</p> <p>What it comes down to is simple: being in the right place at the right time and having the right friends with the right guns and interests. Precedent, for all of the diplomats' fear of the word, is only part of it. It is where you are on the map and what you can get away with that counts. In 2002, on a trip to Iraqi Kurdistan, I was struck by the way the Kurds' homeland had been carved up as the Ottoman empire collapsed. Few Kurds I met then made any secret of their desire not just to achieve independence from Iraq but also to act as a vanguard that would eventually rally Kurds from Iran, Syria, and Turkey into one large Kurdish state.</p> <p>I asked one official if the aim of a Kurdish federal unit in Iraq was to provide an example for Kurds in Turkey and so that later they could join together. \"Yes,\" he said. \"That's the aim.\" Then, embarrassed, he added: \"But don't write that down.\" Musa Ali Bakr, the man who was then in charge of refugees in the Kurdish region of Dahuk, explained that if the Iraqi Kurds moved too quickly their neighbours would strangle them by closing the borders. He then summed up what for me then was the Kurdish dilemma, but I now realise is really the dictum of all successful separatists: \"If you are sick, you visit the doctor. He prescribes the medicine. You take a spoonful three times a day and eventually you are better, you are free. However, if you drank the whole bottle all at once, it would kill you.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tim Judah covers the Balkans for the Economist.

  "<p>Robert Mugabe's officials claimed to have reached a deal to form a coalition government with a minor opposition faction yesterday in the hope of winning international legitimacy after talks with the president's main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, collapsed when Zimbabwe's leader refused to relinquish power. </p> <p>An agreement between Mugabe and Arthur Mutambara, leader of a breakaway group from Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change, to form a national unity administration could give the president control of the new parliament. But it would not open the door to the foreign aid Zimbabwe needs to stabilise its wrecked economy, which is collapsing under inflation estimated at above 10m per cent. </p> <p>Britain and other foreign donors have said they will not unlock a \u00a31bn aid package until Mugabe relinquishes power to Tsvangirai who won the first round of presidential elections in March but withdrew from a run-off contest three months later amid a state-sponsored campaign of murder, beatings and abductions against his supporters. </p> <p>The terms of any deal with Mutambara were not immediately clear, although it is likely Mugabe offered him the newly created post of prime minister or a vice-presidency and some cabinet posts. Mugabe will retain real power. </p> <p>Mutambara's faction holds just 10 seats in parliament but they represent the balance of power and could keep Zanu-PF in control after it lost its outright majority for the first time since independence 28 years ago. However, it is not certain that all of the Mutambara faction would support a deal with Mugabe.</p> <p>Some of Mutambara's aides denied Zanu-PF's claims of an agreement and it may yet prove to be a negotiating tactic to add to pressure on Tsvangirai.</p> <p>Mutambara, an Oxford-educated robotics professor who appeared to look down on Tsvangirai as his intellectual inferior but who failed to connect with the mass of voters, said he would make an announcement today. </p> <p>But South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who mediated the talks in Harare, said Mugabe and Mutambara were \"agreed\" on the terms of a deal while Tsvangirai objected. </p> <p>Mbeki said the talks had not failed and were adjourned to give Tsvangirai time to consider the issues. But sources close to the MDC leader said the three days of negotiations in Harare ran into the ground after Mugabe agreed to appoint Tsvangirai as prime minister but insisted on retaining ultimate authority over government. Among the Zimbabwean leader's demands was that he be the most senior member of the cabinet.</p> <p>Mugabe also rejected significant constitutional reform and insisted that a new coalition administration under his authority serve a full five-year term. Tsvangirai wanted an interim government of about two years before new elections.</p> <p>\"Mugabe wanted Tsvangirai as a ceremonial prime minister. There was never any serious intent by Mugabe to give up power,\" said a source close to the negotiations. \"There is no future for these talks unless the facilitator [Mbeki] is able to come forward with proposals that demonstrate a change in Mugabe's position.\"</p> <p>Last night Mugabe's supporters were attempting to blame Tsvangirai for the failure of the negotiations, accusing him of storming out of the talks when they did not go his way. The MDC said Tsvangirai left when the meetings were finished. </p> <p>Mbeki has persistently talked up the prospects for a deal between the two main rivals for power. He arrived on Sunday with his aides predicting an agreement within the day in the hopes that a new government and parliament would be installed this week; that would have permitted Mbeki to claim a great success at a regional heads of government summit in Johannesburg this weekend. </p> <p>But a source close to the talks described Mbeki's role as \"hopelessly weak\". The source said: \"The pressure only went one way, on Tsvangirai, and he had no proposals to break the logjam.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch yesterday said the state-orchestrated campaign of violence against the opposition had claimed at least 163 lives with more than 5,000 others beaten and tortured.</p> <h2>Profile: Arthur Mutambara</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Born in May 1966, Arthur Mutambara is a former student leader who is recognised as one of Africa's most prominent scientists.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>While at the University of Zimbabwe in the late 1980s, he led the student opposition to the ruling ZANU-PF.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A former Rhodes Scholar, he specialised in the study of robotics.

  "<p>Government grants to encourage corner shops to stock more fresh fruit and vegetables are to be trialled as part of a campaign to persuade people to eat more healthily, the Department of Health will announce today. </p> <p>It is hoped that the pilot scheme, aimed at small shopkeepers in deprived areas, will help tackle the growing problem of obesity. The shops will be offered grants to buy shelving, chiller cabinets and promotional materials to wean people away from a diet of ready meals and chips.</p> <p>The department said it selected north-east England due to its \"poor general health record compared to other parts of the country.\" The region also had some excellent primary care trusts, which are responsible for public health campaigns, and a good distribution of convenience stores.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"We are looking for stores in deprived areas that do not currently sell fruit and veg and/or stores in less deprived areas where there are limited places to buy fruit and veg.</p> <p>\"We are relying on the convenience store groups to identify stores that meet these criteria and we'll then check to make sure we've got a good mix across the region.\"</p> <p>The department has set aside \u00a3600,000 over the next three years to provide the grants and pay the salary of a project coordinator, who will help shopkeepers maximise profits and minimise waste.</p> <p>It said: \"The healthy stores initiative will not mean that shopkeepers will stop selling crisps, sweets, fizzy drinks and other unhealthy snacks. They will just make room for and promote more fresh fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>\"Obesity is the biggest health challenge we face. It causes 9,000 people to die prematurely every year. It costs the NHS \u00a34.2bn and the economy \u00a316bn per year.\"</p> <p>The spokeswoman acknowledged that the department had not done a count of shops to establish that people in the north-east had the least chance of observing the government's message to eat five portions of fruit and veg a day. But officials knew the region had plenty of neighbourhoods that could be regarded as vegetable-free zones.</p> <p>She said the corner shop initiative will be branded with the logo of Change4Life, \"a government-led movement that will help everyone change the way they live and live healthier lives\".</p> <p>Ivan Lewis, the health minister, said: \"We know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and other household goods. It is therefore essential we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet.</p> <p>\"Consumer habits are shifting. People shop around at different outlets several times a week, so it's important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them.\"</p> <p>The department hopes to sign up the first 120 stores by next May. It has modelled the scheme on an experiment in Scotland, where more than 500 stores participated. The grant-aided shopkeepers said their profits rose by at least 20%.</p>",

  "<p>Sensible grouse - and sensible shooters - were lying low yesterday as torrential rain swept most moors on the Glorious Twelfth. But one upland bird was preening itself in the comfortable protection of buildings as varied as Chichester Cathedral and Manchester Town Hall. Britain's peregrine falcons have come to town. Pairs have nested this summer at more than 10 urban sites where they are safe from gunfire and provided with meals from scraps and vermin on a grand scale. Like their relatives the red kites, whose revived population is scoping out suburbs in Leeds, Oxford and Gateshead, they help the binmen in a small-scale but dramatic manner. There could hardly be a more sensible move for a raptor which remains the victim of rogue gamekeepers in the countryside because of an exaggerated belief in the scale of its predation on young game birds. Better protection and stronger enforcement has halted a decline in the rural population and even seen a modest rise in the last decade. But town-dwelling adds a cushion to their numbers, and one much less susceptible to change. \"Be wowed as you watch them chase their lunch through the air!\" exclaim handouts from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds about the peregrines currently living high on the chimney of Tate Modern in London. Four free telescopes are focused all day on these birds, the fastest animals in the world, and visitors queue for them.

  "<p>Talks to resolve Zimbabwe's political crisis were on the brink of collapse last night as Robert Mugabe refused to surrender control of the government, despite losing the country's last credible election.</p> <p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who has been mediating the negotiations, was making a final push to reach agreement before heading back to Pretoria. </p> <p>But the two sides remained far apart as the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, continued to insist that democracy be respected.</p> <p>Mbeki arrived on Sunday with his aides predicting an agreement within the day in the hope that a new government and parliament would be installed this week, permitting Mbeki to claim a success at a regional heads of government summit in Johannesburg this weekend. </p> <p>But although Tsvangirai had endorsed a plan for Mugabe to remain president with a largely ceremonial function, the opposition said it became apparent Zimbabwe's ruler for the 28 years since independence did not intend to give up power. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is trying to reach a deal with the leader of a small breakaway Movement for Democratic Change faction, Arthur Mutambara, whose 10 seats in parliament hold the balance of power.

  "<p>It might seem a far cry from the golden age of post-war housing, when both main political parties competed to deliver millions of homes in record time and \"credit crunch\" had yet to enter the popular vocabulary, but after a gap of more than 20 years, town halls are now re-entering an area regarded as no-go territory until recently - planning thousands of new council houses. </p> <p>While nothing today matches the determination of post-war governments to put the state's resources behind a heavily-subsidised construction programme - Tory housing minister Harold Macmillan saw 354,000 new homes built in 1954 alone - an emerging building project in east London is providing the impetus for councils around the country to think bigger.</p> <p>Barking and Dagenham council will soon start work on 500 new homes on the site of an old estate, called the Lintons, and it is planning for a further 8,000 homes over the next 12 to 15 years. The attraction is simple: by clearing three tower blocks, which incorporate 256 flats, the authority can double the number of homes on the site - demolishing the myth that high rise living was economical with land. </p> <p>More than half of the new properties will either be for full renting or \"affordable\" part-owned part-rented, and the London borough will manage many of them directly, with the remainder being sold. Ken Jones, the council's head of housing strategy, insists that many of the new homes will be council houses in the real sense. \"We have two advantages - land prices are cheaper here than the rest of London, and the council owns much of the land,\" he says. \"That means we are 'de-risking' the operation.\" If the credit crunch continues, the council can still rent out properties that won't sell on the open market.</p> <p>Council housing, a pejorative term for too long, is creeping back into favour. Housing minister Caroline Flint said last week she was willing to take a \"totally pragmatic\" view of whether councils could be allowed to build homes and keep the rental income. The reasons for the rethink are twofold. First, housing associations, now the main providers of social housing, are feeling the heat from the credit crunch because cash from planning gain agreements - under which developers agree to include an element of affordable housing in large-scale projects in order to secure planning permission - is fast drying up. At the same time, associations are having trouble selling homes they have built for sale to subsidise social housing.</p> <p>Second, councils are seen as a safe bet to drive deals forward because they are not only creditworthy but also have untold acres of land suitable for redevelopment - while, as planning authorities, they are in a position to push though projects relatively quickly. However, unlike housing associations, town halls cannot borrow on the open market, although they can use land they own as a lever to attract investment.</p> <p>The key to unlocking the potential of town halls is a new vehicle, a local housing company, in which a council establishes a joint venture with a developer to build both private and social homes, while retaining management control over the latter once they are built. The town hall comes to the table with land, which can constitute a half stake in a company.</p> <p>While Barking and Dagenham is first off the starting block, Nottingham, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and others are all poised to launch joint companies with the help of the government's regeneration agency English Partnerships. It is trying to push through more joint venture projects on publicly owned land as one way of resurrecting housebuilding - now down to the lowest levels in over 60 years. </p> <p><strong>Back in favour</strong></p> <p>In Scotland, too, council housing is back in favour. Edinburgh is planning 1,100 homes on council land in three areas; at least a third of them are destined for renting, and will be subsidised by the remainder being offered for outright sale. The city council hopes to benefit from a share of \u00a3250m promised by the Scottish executive to reward councils returning to council house building.</p> <p>All this is happening when the government is reviewing the role of councils in managing and providing housing. It is a complex and emotive area, the result of the government's ambivalent attitude towards council housing. For at least the last 15 years, councils have been encouraged to hive off their housing stock, either to housing associations or to arm's length management organisations (Almos), where modernisation cash to bring properties to decent-homes standards is much easier to access.</p> <p>Cash to maintain council stock, let alone build new stock, can still be elusive for many councils. This year, for instance, under a bizarre \"redistribution\" formula ostensibly designed to spread the proceeds of social housing evenly around the country, the Treasury will receive \u00a3800m in council house rental income from English councils, but will return only \u00a3600m to councils - prompting critics, such as the vocal Defend Council Housing campaign, to complain that the government is \"profiting\" from council housing. There is no guarantee that the \u00a3200m surplus - due to climb to \u00a3303m by 2010 - will be ploughed back into housing.</p> <p>The government's ambivalent attitude towards council housing is further underlined by the continuation of house sales. In what marked the biggest privatisation of all, 1.7m homes have been sold for a fraction of their market value since the 1980s. With sales still continuing at a much slower rate, and with less generous discounts than the peak years of the 1980s, calls to halt sales in hard-pressed areas where social homes are hard to find - particularly villages - are gaining momentum following moves in Scotland and Wales. And in urban areas such as Barking and Dagenham, the drive for new council housing runs the risk of being undermined if sales are allowed to continue. </p> <p>The east London borough has already lost half its stock - 20,000 homes - under the contentious right-to-buy policy of the last Tory government, which has continued under New Labour, albeit at a much lower rate latterly. Jon Cruddas, Labour MP for Dagenham, laments that the best homes - 85% of them with gardens - have now largely disappeared. \"The worst housing stock in the most challenging estates remains in council ownership,\" he said recently. \"Waiting times for being housed by the council are lengthening almost exponentially.\"</p> <p>Today, councils in England own 1.9m homes, either directly (800,000 homes) or through Almos. Housing associations also have 1.9m. </p> <p>Those councils directly running housing are fighting back under the umbrella of a group called the Association of Retained Council Housing (Arch). Its secretary, John Bibby, director of housing and community services at Lincoln city council, is heartened by the new-found enthusiasm of ministers towards council housing. His organisation has long complained of a grossly uneven playing field, tilted against council housing and preventing local authorities, unlike housing associations, from using their housing assets and future rental streams as collateral to borrow to build. \"It does seem that the government is listening at last - partly out of pragmatism because of the credit crunch,\" says Bibby, whose authority owns 8,000 houses.</p> <p>Remarkably, with the odds stacked against them, Bibby estimates councils still manage to build \"between 300 to 400\" houses annually from their own limited resources. \"But the potential for council housing on any scale would have to depend on a radical review of the current [housing revenue account] system,\" he cautions.</p> <p><strong>Caught in a trap</strong></p> <p>Over the next five years alone, Lincoln will \"lose\" \u00a36m in rental income to the Treasury - cash that could build around 40 houses. Scores of other councils are also caught in this trap, unable to keep all the money they raise from renting to plough back into maintenance and new building.</p> <p>Is the government, then, poised for a major shakeup of the system and to allow councils to build on a much bigger scale? </p> <p>The pressing case for more social housing has been underlined in a new survey from the Local Government Association - on the back of figures showing house repossessions up by almost 50% in a year. It forecasts that the number of people on council house waiting lists is now set to top 5 million in less than two years' time. </p> <p>While local housing companies offer one way forward, as yet there seems little appetite in Whitehall to relax the rules to herald a return to the golden days of council housebuilding.</p>",
  "<p>If you fail your A-levels, instead of wallowing in disappointment, work out a contingency plan, whether it be clearing or re-doing your exams, advises Dr Tom Fawcett from Salford University.</p> <p>The \"mental toughness\" expert, who is credited with darts player Phil \"the Power\" Taylor's return to form, says a typical emotional reaction to failure is to say 'I can't be bothered'.</p> <p>\"It's the expectation effect and dealing with immense disappointment or success can be difficult. The important thing is how people deal with a setback and using it as a constructive way to make themselves mentally tougher and more able to deal with future failures,\" he says.</p> <p>\"No one is immune to failure so it's really important that people learn that failures will happen and have a constructive plan to deal with them.\"</p> <p>If you deal with disappointment head on and act assertively in a difficult situation you can easily turn a negative into a positive, he suggests. \"Really driven people go forward and correct that error. It might mean retaking and spending 12 months righting a wrong.</p> <p>\"You have to understand what you did and the processes that led to the failure. With athletes it's a case of analysing their performance and working out what went wrong and going back and rectifying it in another performance to succeed.</p> <p>\"Taking an exam is exactly the same process of working out how the failure occurred and what was in your control and what was outside it \u2013 what you can control to be more successful in future.\"</p> <p>Fawcett has personal experience of failure after dropping out of school with few O-levels at 16, while his twin brother got 11 O-levels and four A-levels. He didn't return to education until 24. \"That initial setback can fester for some time,\" he says.</p> <p>\"It's difficult but worth the effort to be disciplined and determined.\" It can become a learned response to failure, he says. \"What you learn from failure can be as valuable as success.\"</p> <p>For A-level students in particular, it's important not to shoulder other people's disappointment. \"Parental expectation can be extremely high but students need to stay focussed on their own needs to succeed,\" Fawcett says.</p> <p>\"That's not to say that a support network can't be extremely valuable in times of crisis. It's vital that young people don't isolate themselves when they feel deflated.</p> <p>\"The most important thing to remember is not to give up. You need to be realistic and understand that an alternative course of action can sometimes work out for the best in the long-term.\"</p>",
  "<p>Vast swathes of the western Amazon are to be opened up for oil and gas exploration, putting some of the planet's most pristine and biodiverse forests at risk, conservationists have warned.</p> <p>A survey of land earmarked for exploration by energy companies revealed a steep rise in recent years, to around 180 zones, which together cover an area of 688,000 sq km, almost equivalent to the size of Texas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.plos.org/press/pone-03-08-finer.pdf\">Detailed mapping of the region</a> shows the majority of planned oil and gas projects, which are operated by at least 35 multinational companies, are in the most species-rich areas of the Amazon for mammals, birds and amphibians.</p> <p>Researchers used government information on land that has been leased to state or multinational energy companies over the past four years to create oil and gas exploration maps for western Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia. The maps showed that in Peru and Ecuador, regions designated for oil and gas projects already cover more than two thirds of the Amazon. Of 64 oil and gas regions that cover 72% of the Peruvian Amazon, all but eight were approved since 2003. Major increases in activity are expected in Bolivia and western Brazil.</p> <p>\"We've been following oil and gas development in the Amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes,\" said Matt Finer of <a href=\"http://www.saveamericasforests.org/\">Save America's Forests</a>, a US-based environment group. \"When you look at where the oil and gas blocks are, they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots, almost as if by design, and this is in one of the most, if not the most, biodiverse place on Earth.\"</p> <p>Some regions have established oil and gas reserves, but in others, companies will need to cut into the forest to conduct speculative tests, including explosive seismic investigations and test drilling. Typically, companies have seven years to explore a region before deciding whether to go into full production.</p> <p>\"The real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase, because that's when the roads, drilling and pipelines come in,\" said Finer.</p> <p>Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/home.action\">PLoS One</a>, Finer and others from Duke university in North Carolina and <a href=\"http://www.landislife.org/\">Land is Life</a>, a Massachusetts-based environment group, call for governments to rethink how energy reserves in the Amazon are exploited.</p> <p>One issue, the authors argue, is that while companies must submit an environmental impact assessment for their project, these are often considered individually instead of collectively. \"They're not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time. </p> <p>\"You could have each individual company thinking they're being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on, but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you? All of a sudden, when you look at the bigger picture, you have a sprawling road network,\" said Finer.</p> <p>The creation of widespread road networks will put previously inaccessible forest at risk of deforestation, illegal hunting and logging, the authors argue. </p> <p>The researchers urge companies to adopt a moratorium on new road building, and instead use helicopters to ferry personnel and machinery to and from the sites, as has been done in some locations. They also call for governments to take a broader view of the environmental impacts of new projects, by assessing them as a group rather than individually.</p> <p>Further research by the team found that many of the planned exploration and extraction projects were on land that is home to indigenous people, who whilst being consulted, have no say in whether a project goes ahead or not. At least 58 of the 64 regions in Peru are on land where isolated communities live, with a further 17 infringing areas that have existing or proposed reserves for indigenous groups.</p> <p>\"The way that oil development is being pursued in the western Amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region,\" said Brain Keane of Land is Life. \"International agreements and inter-American human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands, and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free, prior and informed consent,\" he added.</p> <p>The report adds that the international community should pay countries in the Amazon to leave forest lands untouched. Ecuador has said it will not develop its largest untapped oil reserve if it receives compensation by the end of the year, an offer that countries have yet to take them up on.</p>",
  "<p>Top-flight clubs have flung their support behind a Premier League initiative which will place more responsibility on club captains to control their team-mates and respect referees in a bid to curb the ugly scenes which have marred some high-profile games in recent seasons.</p> <p>The Get On With The Game campaign, a response to the Football Association's recently launched Respect scheme, is supported by all 20 clubs and will see captains and senior coaching staff present at the exchange of the team sheets in advance of every league fixture in a bid to open another line of communication with referees. </p> <p>Officials will also seek the captains' cooperation on the pitch at flashpoints in matches, while television monitors are to be removed from technical areas in a bid to avoid overt dissent over decisions.</p> <p>The three major broadcasters - BSkyB, Setanta and the BBC - will also use the former referees Dermot Gallagher and Paul Durkin to offer insights into key decisions in an attempt to avoid any confusion, with the Premier League's chief executive Richard Scudamore insistent that there is a united desire to improve standards of behaviour in the most high-profile league in world football.</p> <p>\"I have been in this job 10 years now and I sense a mood for something to happen,\" said Scudamore. \"If we had mentioned this three years ago I think the reaction would have been different. Now everyone - club chairmen, managers, players, officials, fans, media - are all saying we saw things last season that overstepped the mark.\"</p> <p>The initiative was welcomed by players present at a glitzy launch staged in three venues simultaneously nationwide yesterday. John Terry, whose Chelsea side were sanctioned for failing to control their players at Manchester United and Derby last season, pledged his support for a scheme that was highlighted nationwide by Ashley Cole's ill-timed dissent against the referee Mike Riley during the 4-4 draw with Tottenham at White Hart Lane earlier this year.</p> <p>\"It's unfair to pick one person or one club out because we've all committed it,\" said Terry. \"I could show you 100 videos of different players and different clubs committing offences. We've all done it. That's in the past and we move on trying to make it better. The will's there, definitely, to improve. This is a step in the right direction because the only way we were going to move forward was by taking some responsibility.</p> <p>\"We still need the tackles flying in and the high tempo in games, to let games flow, and the referees also have a responsibility as well. But the important thing is there is now some consistency. There are now rules. Last year, was there or wasn't there a rule where you couldn't surround the referee? I couldn't tell you. Now there's a rule. You can't. It's the captain who has that responsibility to go and speak to the referee. The others guys are going to get booked. Now we all know that, there's some consistency - from the referees' association, from the panel, from the players.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Church is always shrewd enough to include a period English comedy in his Chichester seasons, but, although Somerset Maugham's 1921 play satisfies Sussex's hunger for something starry and stylish, it is also more subversive than it appears. Underneath its stately exterior, it amounts to a subjective plea for sexual and emotional freedom.</p> <p>When Maugham wrote the play he was married to an interior designer, Syrie Wellcome, but in love with a young American, Gerald Haxton. Transposing a gay dilemma into hetero terms, Maugham shows the wife of a stuffy MP, who has an unexpected Syrie-like passion for domestic decor, debating whether to run off with an impecunious rubber planter. Her instinct to abscond is checked only by the example of her mother-in-law, Lady Kitty, who 30 years ago sacrificed everything for love and has since turned into a berouged vulgarian. Maugham clearly identifies with his heroine, Elisabeth, though it is faintly ironic that, in a desperate attempt to preserve his youth by taking a serum made of sheep's cells, he later came to resemble Lady Kitty.</p> <p>None of this, I suspect, concerns a modern audience who yearn to see classy people saying classy things, which is, by and large, what they get in Church's polished production. Susan Hampshire is far too beautiful to be an ideal Lady Kitty but, through sheer acting skill, she captures all the character's posturing, painted affectation. Philip Voss is also magnificently gruff and grumpy as her long-standing lover, David Yelland exudes a silvery cynicism as her complacently cuckolded husband, and Charity Wakefield and Bertie Carvel are suitably tremulous as the young lovers. It makes for a comforting night out; but Maugham, in putting the case for economic equality for women and sexual freedom for everyone, showed that you can occasionally smuggle ideas into polite drawing-room comedy.</p>",
  "<p>\"Weak, strained, childish and bombastic,\" is how Rachmaninov described his own First Symphony after its disastrous 1897 premiere. Posterity has proved him wrong, but even so, few would rate the symphony a masterpiece. A young man's work, it attempts to steer the Russian symphony towards post-Romantic extremism, but lacks the formal control to give its emotions shape or meaning. Gianandrea Noseda's performance with the BBC Philharmonic, however, was so exciting that qualms about the piece itself were simply set aside. </p> <p>Rachmaninov's debt to Tchaikovsky was more than once apparent - but so, too, were the intimations of the composer of the Paganini Rhapsody and the Symphonic Dances. The overall effect, however, was of superbly articulated frenzy, breathtakingly played and utterly overwhelming.</p> <p>The concert's real raison d'\u00eatre, however, was a performance of Il Tabarro, to mark the 150th anniversary of Puccini's birth. Noseda has not conducted Italian opera in the UK for more than a decade; this was a reminder of what we have been missing. Conducting with unnerving restraint, he treated the opera as an analysis of marital failure, all the while reminding us that the itinerant lives of its protagonists are also a metaphor for the uncertainties of the human condition. </p> <p>It could perhaps have been more consistently sung. Barbara Frittoli was wonderful as tragic, adulterous Giorgetta, though her intensity was not quite matched by Lado Ataneli's soft-voiced Michele or Miroslav Dvorsky's sometimes coarse Luigi.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers' plans to hold in secret inquests that are deemed to put national security at risk are expected to face defeat when the House of Lords votes on them this autumn. A cross-party committee of peers, including a former lord chief justice and two former attorney-generals, has told the government that any decision to hold an inquest without a jury must be taken by a judge and not a minister.</p> <p>It is expected that peers will block the measure in October unless ministers are prepared to climb down over the right of ministers to exercise the power.</p> <p>The move reflects the growing protests from coroners, lawyers, MPs and families of terror victims over the plan since it was revealed as part of the government's counter-terrorism bill in February. Debate over the \"secret inquests\" measure has been overshadowed by the legislation's proposal to extend the pre-charge detention of terror suspects to 42 days.</p> <p>The provision contained in section 63 would allow the home secretary to stop a jury being summoned, replace the coroner with a government appointee and bar the public from inquests if it is certified that an open hearing would put national security at risk. </p> <p>It would enable specially vetted coroners to sit in private without a jury in cases where there is evidence involving national intelligence or any matter deemed by the home secretary \"not to be in the public interest\" including its impact on international relations.</p> <p>Critics have warned that the measure is so widely drafted it could have been applied in cases as varied as the police shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, and \"friendly fire\" military inquests. They believe it breaches a fundamental right to a public inquiry into a death.</p> <p>The Home Office minister Lord West said the decision to certify an inquest as involving sensitive material could be challenged through judicial review so a judge would have the opportunity to scrutinise the decision.</p>",
  "<p>Local councils, health authorities and hundreds of other public bodies are to be given the power to access details of everyone's personal text, emails and internet use under Home Office proposals published yesterday.</p> <p>Ministers want to make it mandatory for telephone and internet companies to keep details of all personal internet traffic for at least 12 months so it can be accessed for investigations into crime or other threats to public safety.</p> <p>The Home Office last night admitted that the measure will mean companies have to store \"a billion incidents of data exchange a day\". As the measure is the result of an EU directive, the data will be made available to public investigators across Europe.</p> <p>The consultation paper published yesterday estimates that it will cost the internet industry over \u00a350m to store the mountain of data.</p> <p>Conservatives and Liberal Democrats last night branded the measure a \"snooper's charter\". </p> <p>When the measure was floated after the London bombings in 2005 by the then home secretary, Charles Clarke, it was justified on the grounds that it was needed to investigate terrorist plots and organised crime. But the Home Office document makes clear that the personal data will now be available for all sorts of crime and public order investigations and may even be used to prevent people self-harming.</p> <p>The measure will mean that details of personal internet and text traffic, but not the content, will have to be made available by telecommunications companies to public sector officials investigating crime, or to \"protect the public\".</p> <p>The measure will also cover VOIP - voice over internet protocol - calls such as Skype.</p> <p>The Home Office confirmed yesterday that access to personal internet and text data will also be available to all public bodies licensed under the 2000 Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). </p> <p>This means that hundreds of public bodies including local councils, health authorities, the Food Standards Agency, the Health and Safety Commission and even the education standards watchdog, Ofsted, will be able to require telecommunications companies to hand over the personal data.</p> <p><br>It is already mandatory for telecommunications companies such as BT, Orange and O2 to keep records of all mobile and landline phone traffic. They voluntarily store electronic internet data as well. But the Home Office said yesterday they now had to make it mandatory because of a European directive requiring all such personal data to be collected across all EU states. </p> <p>This is justified on the grounds that much of the information is already stored as billing information by the companies.</p> <p>Clarke campaigned strongly in Europe for the measure to be adopted after the 7/7 bombings in London.</p> <p>The government has already indicated that it intends to go one step further this autumn by introducing a draft communications bill which would require all the telecommunications companies to hand over this data to one central \"super\" database so that the police and other public authorities will be able to access it directly without having to make a request each time to the individual company holding the records.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said that historic communications data was a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime: \"This data allows investigators to identify suspects, examine their contacts, establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities, identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest. Many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data. Without the EC directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost.\"</p> <p>But the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman, Chris Huhne, said that ministers had proved time and again they were not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seemed intent on pressing ahead with this snooper's charter: \"We will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if Ripa powers are anything to go by, it will soon be used to spy on ordinary people's kids, pets and bins.\"</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, added: \"Yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances.\"</p> <p>The chief surveillance commissioner, Sir Christopher Rose, last month criticised local councils for \"a serious misunderstanding of the concept of proportionality\" in their use of their intrusive surveillance powers.</p>",
  "<h2>London mayor favours Thames estuary airport</h2> <p>London's mayor, Boris Johnson, has called for an \"urgent\" study into building a new airport in the Thames estuary. Johnson said the capital needed further airport capacity to alleviate dire conditions for passengers. \"It is ever more urgent that we investigate the possibility of a long-term solution, in the form of a new and more eco-friendly international airport at a site in the Thames estuary,\" he said in his weekly newspaper column. The mayor, who has no control over airport construction, said voters would be hearing \"a lot more in due course\" about a new airport.<br><strong>Dan Milmo</strong></p> <h2>InterContinental looks up in a downturn</h2> <p>InterContinental Hotels Group, the world's largest hotelier, has recruited more franchisee partners for new developments in the first six months of 2008 than it did in the same period last year - despite difficult debt and property markets. Chief executive Andy Cosslett said the US remained its \"biggest engine for pipeline growth\". Some analysts remained \"highly sceptical\" about the likely fruition of these deals. Meanwhile, seven hotels in Beijing were opened last month, just in time for the Olympics, but IHG said it would miss a target of opening 125 hotels in China in 2008.<br><strong>Simon Bowers</strong></p> <h2>Soaring costs threaten infrastructure projects</h2> <p>Big infrastructure projects are facing budget-busting cost increases as raw material and labour costs soar, says a report out today.

  "<p>There is a scene in Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine where the film-maker investigates the home life of a six-year-old boy who has shot his Michigan classmate. He discovers that the boy lives with his mother and young siblings, but rarely sees his one parent. To qualify for food stamps and healthcare, mum is on a Welfare to Work programme which forces her out of the house early in the morning to make the 60-mile bus journey to the first of her two jobs. Despite travelling three hours a day to hold down two menial jobs she is unable to make ends meet and is evicted by the landlord. Days before the shooting, she takes her family to live at her brother's house, which is where her young son, unbeknown to her, lays his hands on a gun. How does a government welfare policy that results in a child being brought up by effectively two absent parents benefit the community, asks the local sheriff. </p> <p>I was reminded of this emotive episode after the work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, ordered a review of the conditions attached to benefits given to lone parents, unemployed people and disabled claimants. The review, which started last week, is being undertaken by Paul Gregg, a Bristol University academic who has specialised in the interaction between benefits and income. The review is in addition to punitive proposals contained in a welfare green paper published last month to make lone parents with children as young as five prepare themselves for work, disabled claimants find a job or face tougher sanctions, and those on jobseeker's allowance for more than two years work for their dole. </p> <p>A paper accompanying the review cites evidence from abroad that demonstrates how requiring participation in full-time work experience as a condition of receiving benefit, such as the Workfare schemes in the US, Canada and Australia, can get more people into work. The paper, More Support, Higher Expectations, does contain a note of caution about the US model, which despite its success at reducing the numbers on welfare was accompanied by a rise in absolute child poverty. This suggests, says the paper, that \"elements of this policy approach - such as time-limiting benefits - would not further our [the UK government's] long-term goals\", which are to help people find work and escape poverty. </p> <p>Critics of the US Workfare scheme say people were prevented from getting, or staying in a job not because they were workshy but because of a variety of problems ranging from demands of childcare, to violent boyfriends and drugs and alcohol. These barriers to employment must be tackled before laying the blame on the individual and forfeiting their right to benefits, they argued. </p> <p>In the UK, the voluntary sector has been strangely silent over the potentially disastrous consequences of coercing vulnerable people into work. Is this because many charities will be bidding for the contracts to run the new welfare system or because they fear a Tory government would impose even tougher rules? Earlier this year, David Cameron proposed a mandatory, year-long work programme of street cleaning for any jobless welfare claimant who had been signing on for two years. But attempts by politicians to win the crown as the most hardline welfare reformer leads to dangerous posturing at the expense of the most vulnerable in society. </p> <p>Recent research by Ruth Patrick, a social policy graduate in Leeds suggests that while many disabled people want to work, compulsion and the threat of benefit withdrawal are clumsy tools to achieve this. Focus groups found it was discrimination by employers and poor access to the workplace that prevented disabled people from getting a job. Like the lone parents in the US, this demonstrates how deducting benefits to reduce worklessness is based on a false analysis of the problems preventing people finding work. The government should listen to welfare claimants, instead of using them to score political points. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alison Benjamin is deputy editor of Society Guardian.</p>",
  "<p>It was not entirely clear what prompted the powers that be in the Workers' Stadium to tinker with their crowd-control buttons just before half-time as Brazil played Nigeria in a women's football group-stage match yesterday.</p> <p>Perhaps it was a belated show of appreciation for the stunning scissors kick that earned Brazil's Christiane her second goal of the game or maybe it was a sign of concern that the match was slipping into a rare lull. Whatever the reason, a cute Olympic mascot appeared on the giant screens at each end of the ground and texted forth the most loathed words of all cynical sports hacks: \"Let's do a Mexican Wave!\" </p> <p>Within seconds team leaders among the blocks of yellow-clad cheerleaders in the crowd went into action. Minutes later the stadium was roaring. Choreographed spontaneity does not come much more impressive than this.</p> <p>\"I am not interested in football. Hardly any of us are,\" says Cindy Yang, one of several thousand cheerleaders bussed in to fill empty seats. \"I want to help the Olympics. It is just a small thing but I want to make a contribution.\"</p> <p>Cindy is wearing a bright yellow \"Cheering by Beijing Workers\" T-shirt and is armed with two inflatable clappers. A political studies tutor, the 25-year-old is one of 400 people recruited from the Beijing College of Industry and Technology. Tens of thousands of others were picked up elsewhere. Since April they have been training three times a week to learn four series of cheers, each involving three to eight moves. </p> <p>Given that Cindy is on a double header (with Canada v Sweden to follow), she deserves a medal for her labours. More likely is criticism from the west that she is another fake element in a staged and superficial Olympics. We saw that response during the torch relay, when it turned out that many - if not all - of the millions of jubilant supporters who lined the route in China had been carefully vetted by the authorities. We also saw such criticism in coverage (including by this correspondent) of the training regime for Chinese athletes, many of whom were picked at a young age for sports they had never heard of.</p> <p>We saw it too in the grumbles about the opening ceremony, when one of the most spectacular sections - the footsteps of fire - turned out to be computer-generated and the cute little girl singing a solo proved to have been lip-synching after the tot with the real voice was bumped because of her unattractive teeth. If orthodontic perfection is a benchmark of success for future Olympics, then London should just give up now.</p> <p>Such criticism may be dismissed as sour grapes, because London will never match the opulence and scale of Beijing. But it is about more than that. It is a whole different way of looking at reality. If you believe truth is individual, chaotic and spontaneous - as I do, thanks to my British background - then these Games are horribly staged. However, if you think reality can be collective, orderly and plannable - a view 12 years in Asia occasionally makes me sympathise with - then they are a work of extraordinary genius and endeavour.</p> <p>Portraying this as a difference between east and west is too simplistic. On Chinese websites I have seen the opening ceremony criticised as overly stylistic and lacking in content. In private conversation I have heard it described as \"fascist\" and \"shameful\". However, talk as a foreign journalist to a Chinese citizen and my experience (on an admittedly small sample) is that people will laud it to the skies and express immense pride in their nation.</p> <p>The Chinese public appear genuinely enthusiastic about these Games. Cheerleaders are not needed at most events. The government is, of course, not the only host of a major event to try to manipulate crowds and generate atmosphere for the sponsors. Nor is it alone in being painfully face-conscious and worried about security. But still, so far, there is a huge difference in the way the public have been allowed to respond compared with other countries.</p> <p>In 2002 I was in Japan for the World Cup, when the public went blissfully, temporarily wild. Passions seemed even more inflamed in South Korea.</p> <p>That moment may yet come here but so far this down-to-earth, fun-filled city seems like another place. Wonderful as it is to have less traffic and cleaner air, the streets have been almost eerie. Most people appear to have been watching at home. In the centre of Beijing on Friday the crowds (mostly visitors from the provinces) were kept off Tiananmen Square for \"safety reasons\" and most of the big screens were switched off.</p> <p>So the collectivist ideal lives on with cheerleaders like Cindy Yang. \"We only used one of our moves today,\" she says. \"That's because we were not completely enthusiastic about these two teams.\" </p> <p>Perhaps later, when the hosts have a good chance of medals, Cindy and the rest of the crowd will let themselves loose and the real China will stand up.</p>",
  "<p>The peculiar trauma of amateur boxing - a sport in which the anticipation of a tough draw, making the weight and praying for some decent judging can drain the enthusiasm of the most optimistic performer - does not seem to touch David Price.</p> <p>For a big man, all 6ft 8in of him, he does not strike the casual observer as worthy of his nickname, Dynamite. In conversation, there is little explosive about the Great Britain team captain and medal aspirant in the super-heavyweight division at these Olympics.</p> <p>Price, who takes on the tough, squat Russian Islam Timurziev in the Workers' Gymnasium in Beijing tonight, is quietly spoken, calm and respectful. He will, of course, be expected to abandon decorum and try to get the British boxing odyssey back on track after a couple of disappointments, but Price will not abandon his discipline.</p> <p>He leads not so much from the front as from above, and has the unerring respect of his little troupe of six scallywags, three of whom have already come through their first-round examinations - Billy Joe and Bradley Saunders, and James DeGale - and two of whom have been eliminated in startlingly contrasting fashions, Frankie Gavin and Joe Murray.</p> <p>Coincidentally, Murray and Gavin take nutritional advice from Ricky Hatton's bodybuilding expert, Kerry Kayes. Despite the input of that expertise, both struggled with their weight in the lead-up to these Games, Gavin failing to beat the scales at the pre-tournament camp in Macau; Murray coping with the bantamweight limit then losing yesterday on points in a controversial exit against China's Yu Gu.</p> <p>The pressure is on the captain to restore confidence. \"I'm reasonably confident,\" said the team coach, Terry Edwards, \"David is very, very confident. He's up against the European champion and world bronze medallist. But David, over the past year or so, has got much stronger and mobile. </p> <p>\"It's not going to be an easy bout, that's for sure. But, if David gets his tactics right and boxes the way he's been boxing, he has a good chance. You can't always be sure of keeping the strong Russian away and he's going to have to not only handle the long-range stuff but fight him on the inside as well. There will be times when he won't be able to keep him away, and he's going to have to be able to work inside.\"</p> <p>Edwards said he had recently watched again tape of the Russian's quarter-final win over the American Michael Hunter at the world championships in Chicago last November, a bout in which Timurziev aggravated a shoulder injury and faded badly in the last round. </p> <p>\"We've got [Timurziev] on video,\" Edwards said, \"and we've tried to keep [Price] calm. I've got to say, he's very calm at the moment. We'll have another look at that video before the bout and study it in detail.\" </p> <p>Timurziev is a throwback eastern bloc heavy hitter, rumbling forward behind a tight guard and rarely changing his pace. To beat him, Price, eight inches taller and with a decided reach advantage, will try to put his jab in the Russian's face until that proves an inadequate deterrent.</p> <p>As Edwards says, it is then that the Liverpudlian will have to go into the trenches. It will be ugly. \"People are already writing me off but that's to my advantage,\" Price says. \"I may have been the last to qualify, but this guy is going to be easy to hit.</p> <p>\"He's 6ft tall, a powerhouse who stalks opponents. But my defence has improved inside a lot. The key will be if I can soak up punches when he gets to me, which he is going to do. It's whether or not I can handle him, but I won't actually know until the night.</p> <p>\"I've seen a lot of him but he has the style I prefer to box, one of those who comes forward and lets his shots go. He's there to be hit but he's proved he can hit himself. If I lose, all the hard work over the past four years will have been for nothing. I don't fear him, I don't fear anyone. To be the best I must beat the best.\"</p> <p>Price is the sort of dyed-in-the-wool amateur who keeps coming back after disappointment, because he loves the sport. He did not qualify for Athens in 2004 and he left his qualification for these Olympics later than any of the team.</p> <p>Price had to beat the 2006 world junior champion Cristian Ciocan of Romania in the second European qualifying tournament in Athens earlier this year to make the squad he now leads. He won 15-6, and his spirits and confidence lifted dramatically. </p> <p>He is a transformed boxer, bringing more power to his long right than in the past, and moving with more efficiency in and out of the hitting zone. Price might never be the heavyweight professional promoters drool over but he is a vital force in this Great Britain team - and should beat the Russian.</p>",
  "<p>No one seriously expected that the two-week time frame <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/zimbabwe\">laid down</a> in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/4\">the July 21 memorandum of understanding</a> would be met. That time frame was a marker: the issues were too serious, and the divisions between the principal stakeholders, Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC and Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF, were too great for an easy solution. Indeed, a quick settlement would have been greeted with scepticism by Zimbabweans, because it would indicate that there had been a wholesale capitulation by one side to the demands of the other side. In politics, as in life, there are no free lunches. </p> <p>The chief negotiators have been locked in talks in Pretoria and Harare since the memorandum was signed. There have been few official progress updates, other than bland announcements that progress is being made, that there are \"sticking points\", but that the talks are continuing. Although the two-week time frame has clearly not been met, all stakeholders are intensely aware that time is of the essence. President Mbeki, chief mediator in the talks, will be attending the SADC heads of government meeting on August 16-17, and he desperately wants, and needs, to be able to report on tangible progress in the talks. For Robert Mugabe and Zanu-PF, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/01/zimbabwe.economics\">recent revaluation</a> of the Zimbabwe dollar and a rash of other currency changes may have made it easier to count the money, but in real terms, it has all the effectiveness of putting a sticking plaster on a cancer. Zimbabwe's inflation rate and soaring cost of living have become untenable for millions of Zimbabweans, and there is the very real prospect of mass starvation if a political solution is not found. This, in itself, is not what is driving Zanu-PF to negotiate; sooner rather than later, there will be no funds left in the national coffers to pay the security sector and, as sanctions begin to bite, there will be no remaining avenues for raising funds. For Tsvangirai's MDC, there is the very real risk that if it fails to reach agreement, there will be a return to violence and a likely internal settlement between Zanu-PF and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4756424.stm\">Mutambara</a> faction of the MDC. </p> <p>The first and fundamental question is whether the two sides are discussing a government of national unity (GNU), similar to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukurahundi\">1987 unity accord</a> between Zanu and Zapu (which led to the demise of the latter); or a transitional authority. In purely emotional terms, Zanu-PF would prefer a GNU, because, for them, it revives happy memories of the 1987 agreement which allowed Zanu-PF to consolidate its power at the expense of Zapu. In practical terms, a GNU as political endpoint would offer a way out for Zanu-PF. The GNU would have a shelf life of up to five years \u2013 plenty of time for the party to regroup, rebrand itself as the \"new Zanu-PF\" by moving towards the political centre, and begin the subtle \"Zanu-fication\" of the MDC. A long-term coalition partnership between the MDC and Zanu-PF would restrict the former's moral and practical room for manoeuvre. Just as importantly, a GNU would shelve the \"norm\" pushed by western governments of a \"winner takes all\", maximalist electoral democracy, which would result in Zanu-PF becoming the party of opposition. A transitional government with a limited life of two years, a constitutional review and credible elections within that period, would place the political process more within the MDC's control, because this would allow the MDC to present the authority as a necessary, but temporary phase on the road to transformation, alleviating charges that the MDC had \"sold out\" to Zanu-PF.</p> <p>The relative role and powers of Mugabe and Tsvangirai are the issues that have caused the most acrimony. Initially, both men wanted the executive presidency, but Mugabe made it clear that this was a non-negotiable condition. The question, then, was: if not the presidency, then what role for Tsvangirai? The answer: he would become prime minister, with Mugabe as president. This much was expected, and tallies with Zimbabwe's political tradition of strongly executive prime ministers and ceremonial presidents, dating back to Rhodesian days. </p> <p>There has thus been much speculation that Tsvangirai will become an executive prime minister, while Mugabe becomes a figurehead. This will not happen, any more than Tsvangirai would agree to become a figurehead prime minister \u2013 all frequent flier miles and no substance. Neither will he permit himself to become a hollow man. </p> <p>Each side, therefore, has accused the other of delaying a deal by insisting on power. Is Tsvangirai right in insisting on some degree of power? Absolutely: a transitional government, which answers only to Mugabe, will not bring progress to Zimbabwe; nor will it bring in investment. In addition, it is vital that the MDC demonstrates that it can be a tough negotiator if it is to gain respect from Zanu-PF and end the perennial criticism that they are political babes in the wood. </p> <p>Hard power requires hard talk. There will probably be a laborious \"<a href=\"http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/ff804c16a66945a8b90323e5e36f63e9.htm\">French model</a>\", by which authority is parcelled out in gobbets to both men. The MDC does have to be realistic, however: Mugabe's authority will certainly be gradually reduced over time, and this is crucial for Zimbabwe's reconstruction, but attempting to remove him from the frame now could actually be counter-productive. No one can deny that Mugabe is certainly a huge part of the problem \u2013 but he is also part of the solution, particularly with regard to the hardliners in the security sector. Assuming that he is \"incentivised\", Mugabe is the only figure with enough authority to corral the militants within the security apparatus, and push them to create an enabling environment for peace. In addition, there is the question of \"saving face\"; even as the 2008 Heroes' Day celebrations <a href=\"http://www.talkzimbabwe.com/news/117/ARTICLE/3152/2008-08-11.html\">are dedicated</a> to Joshua Nkomo, it is clear that the dedication is not merely to try and appropriate Zapu's legacy, but also for Mugabe to send a coded warning that he does not intend to meet the same fate as Nkomo.</p> <p>And so begins the internal scramble for Zimbabwe, as both sides parcel out portfolios, as if playing a game of <a href=\"http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:0BBuyUHYgtwJ:www.jpanafrican.com/docs/vol2no4/2.4_Shona_Traditional_Children.pdf+nhodo&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=6&amp;gl=uk\">nhodo</a>. The security sector won't budge on the army, air force, CIO and home affairs ministry, all of which they see as strategic sectors. The MDC will get the police, finance and, possibly, agriculture, but they'll have a tough task to prise foreign affairs from Zanu-PF. Reportedly, there are plans afoot to replace the <a href=\"http://www.hararetribune.com/index.php?news=18\">JOC</a> with a national security council (NSC), which would include representatives from both parties. The 2006 national security council, which contained the military top brass, set up nine taskforces to manage Zimbabwe's crumbling economy. The role of the security sector is a major issue: the MDC's adherence to non-violent change has given it a moral authority, which Zanu-PF utterly lacks, but it also allows the generals to claim that the MDC officials are civilians who don't deserve a place at the military table. The power of the military will not be broken in the short term, but it is vital for the agreement to create mechanisms to dilute its power. This means making the military accountable to parliament. Parliament itself has to be depoliticised \u2013 in the best sense of the word \u2013 and re-professionalised. If the NSC is created, it will need representation from civilian as well as military stakeholders, and it must be a transitional mechanism with a finite term of duty and roles.</p> <p>Much has been said about the MDC's parliamentary majority as providing leverage against Zanu-PF during the negotiations. While its majority is important, we shouldn't kid ourselves that this is what has driven Zanu-PF to the table. The MDC's majority is, after all, notional \u2013 they are heavily dependent on the mercurial Mutambara faction for this majority, and Mutambara's group seesaws between the two key stakeholders. Zanu-PF is a past master at using political carrots and sticks, in parliament and elsewhere, to have its way. The numbers are a start, but the real issue is how to end the culture of political corruption and militarism which has become all-pervasive. </p> <p>The key lies in building into the agreement processes, which will re-professionalise and empower Zimbabwe's political institutions. This entails a pragmatic, functional compact between political sector, business, the security sector and civil society. The relationship between the soldiers and civil society, in particular, has been poisonous, yet both sides will have to put aside their prejudices to make an agreement work; this is not yet a time for abolitionists. If the MDC cannot sit at the soldiers' top table, it has to push for authority over the judiciary, because, in the long term, this is the ministry that will determine Zimbabwe's long-term governance. A deal that allows Zanu-PF to retain control over the soldiers and the judges will leave the status quo intact. </p> <p>In addition, strengthening parliamentary committees and oversight mechanisms is an essential component of reintroducing parliamentary accountability. In the 1980s, we used to have a prime minister's question time \u2013 the symbolic significance of reintroducing this would be very valuable. </p> <p>Will the final deal essentially be an elite compact, an ambivalent hybrid agreement, which doesn't represent the real wishes of Zimbabweans? The secrecy surrounding the negotiations does not inspire confidence. For both Zanu-PF supporters, but more so for the MDC supporters, there are serious concerns as to what kind of deal is being made. There has been little consultation with the people, and there is little chance of a referendum to ratify or reject whatever is hammered out. </p> <p>There is also the question of external agendas. Who ultimately benefits from a final agreement? The MDC needs a deal it can \"sell\" to London and Washington; Mugabe needs a deal which he can sell to the hawks in the JOC; Mbeki needs a deal he can sell to SADC and the African Union. But will it be a deal that addresses the real needs of ordinary Zimbabweans? </p> <p>The question of transitional justice is vital. There is a huge moral imperative to try the organisers and perpetrators of political violence, but the sobering reality is that the generals will not be tried anytime soon. Much has been said about giving a \"soft landing\" to the security sector; for the soldiers, who, after all, are the ones in power, the issue is more one of giving a \"soft landing\" to the MDC. The military will not agree to detailed proposals for human rights tribunals. What may be agreed is a diluted annexe to any agreement, which stipulates the need for compensation to be paid to the victims of violence, but which doesn't directly blame Zanu-PF; and a broad agreement on the need for justice against the perpetrators of the violence. There will be nothing specific, and the question of justice and compensation for the 1980s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukurahundi\">Gukurahundi</a> and 2000-2008 atrocities will not be directly addressed. </p> <p>In the short term, the deal will trade peace for justice. The talks will proceed in fits and starts, but ultimately a deal will be reached. It is likely to be a collage, a democ<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimurenga\">urenga</a> accord; but at least it will be a start.</p>",
  "<p>Evo Morales has jumped over yet another hurdle this weekend. He has managed to secure a new vote of confidence from among the social movements and grassroots that constitute the loose coalition that is his political platform. This backing is what he needs to further advance his drive to transform Bolivia into a socialist state. But this is also an unfortunate step further into a vicious cycle of ideological polarisation from which, Latin American history says, one can only leave through violence and the absolute rejection of the past. Morales should know better. He is, after all, the latest personification of this Latin American way of reform. If he wants to avoid this future, he should review his strategy and introduce knowledge into the policy debate.</p> <p>The support that Morales enjoys today must be seen in relation to the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601086&amp;sid=a47FvHUj4uyQ&amp;refer=latin_america\">political forces in the country</a>. It would be a mistake to assume that this vote is the deepening of democracy and that Morales' party, MAS, is backed up by traditional democratic forces. It would even be a mistake to assume that el MAS is a political party at all. </p> <p>What Morales and his supporters enjoy is a perverse love-hate relationship that is feeding a vicious process of exclusion and polarisation of Bolivian society in matter of public interest. Morales' MAS is a loose coalition of highly political social movements, lacks the most basic characteristics of a political party \u2013 and it does not attempt to be one. In fact, it draws its strength from its image as the anti-party (just like Alberto Fujimori did in Peru in the 1990s \u2013 with similar anti-party rhetoric; albeit for neoliberal policy objectives). </p> <p>El MAS' type of democracy is no longer the participatory democracy of the Bolivian popular participation law. Bolivian political scientist Carlos Toranzo has classified it as a \"gobierno por plebicito\" (government by plebiscite). Mass demonstrations and \"cabildos abiertos\" (public meetings) create an illusion of democracy that actually undermines democracy. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/bolivia\">Bolivia today</a>, people's participation has gone beyond the boundaries of the legislation and the principles of an orderly, constructive and inclusive <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5icZrFuWnQi36L3-KJnSKwKf-9Y5gD92GGEK81\">participation</a>. </p> <p>Mass popular support wins the day but comes at a price. For the shows of force and confidence votes, Morales has had to make promises that follow an ideological line that feeds the political fire of the social movements and cools their socio-economic concerns. For example, el MAS and its supporters have rejected the idea of a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States to replace the current unilateral trade preferences agreement (ATPDEA). However, many of Morales' supporters in the coca-producing areas and the urban factories of El Alto, outside La Paz, draw their income directly from the ATPDEA (and would do so from the FTA). Without an FTA, his government has turned to the profits of the natural gas sector as a source of funds for an ever-increasing portfolio of cash transfers and other direct subsidies; which would be unnecessary if the FTA was appropriately negotiated and implemented. </p> <p>But the price of popular support is closing the door to this trade policy mechanism altogether. El MAS' policies are directed to both rally their supporters around an ideological narrative and satisfy their increasing demands as a consequence of the shortcomings of those same policies. </p> <p>These policies are also broadening the gap between those who support Morales and those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/bolivia.usa\">who oppose him</a>. As Naomi Mapstone in the Financial Times has so <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f7358b92-6769-11dd-8d3b-0000779fd18c.html\">eloquently illustrated</a>, the \"socializaci\u00f3n\" of the Bolivian state, the nationalisation of the Bolivian economy and his anti-western and anti-decentralisation rhetoric is radicalising the lowlands: government authorities, the private sector and civil society in the lowlands are all in opposition to the central government and Morales' apparent grip on power. </p> <p>To withstand their increasing pressure, Morales resorts to ever more radical policy promises and political discourses. He has approached Cuba and Venezuela (and signed the ALBA treaty that is irrelevant for the country's trade interests), promises to nationalise new industries, <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/04/30/america/web.0430trade.php\">rejects all FTAs</a> and is letting the current ATPDEA (that accounts for about 12% of all Bolivian labour intensive exports) expire at the end of the year. With each policy decision his government makes, he simultaneously prompts a new level of demand from those who support and those who oppose him; and this increasingly narrows his room for manoeuvre. </p> <p>The natural ultimate consequence of this process is, and Morales should know it all too well, the collapse of the system. Absolute power in Latin America always leads to absolute change.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336490041\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Kremlin today dictated humiliating peace terms to Georgia as the price for halting the Russian invasion of the small Black Sea country and its four-day rout of Georgian forces.</p> <p>Faced with strong western denunciation of the Russian onslaught, President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia called a halt to the Russian offensive and negotiated terms for a truce and a broader settlement with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who, as chair of the European Union, rushed to the region to try to strike a deal on a ceasefire.</p> <p>Branding President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia a \"lunatic\", Medvedev outlined tough terms to the French leader, in effect demanding Georgian capitulation to vastly superior Russian forces.</p> <p>\"The difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them,\" Medvedev said. \"So you have to use surgery.\"</p> <p>\"We do not yet have a peace deal, we have a provisional cessation of hostilities, but this is significant progress,\" Sarkozy said after several hours of talks with Medvedev in Moscow and before taking the terms to Saakashvili in Tbilisi.</p> <p>The key Russian demands are that the Georgian leader pledges, in an agreement that is signed and legally binding, to abjure all use of force in his country in any attempt to resolve the territorial disputes with the two breakaway pro-Russian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; and that Georgian forces withdraw entirely from South Ossetia and are no longer part of the joint \"peacekeeping\" contingent there with Russian and local Ossetian forces.</p> <p>Medvedev also insisted that the populations of the two breakaway regions had to be allowed to vote on whether they wanted to join Russia, prefiguring a possible annexation by Moscow that would enfeeble and diminish Georgia and leave Saakashvili looking crushed.</p> <p>If Saakashvili balked at the tough terms from Moscow, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: \"We will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous Georgian aggression.\"</p> <p>Russian leaders are consistently emphasising that Georgian forces perpetrated atrocities against civilians when Saakashvili gave the go-ahead last week for the bungled attempt to recapture control of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The Georgian gamble was the trigger for the onslaught which the US state department today described as \"plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of Russia\".</p> <p>The Georgian forces have been part of the peacekeepers in South Ossetia for the past 15 years. But Russian leaders declared today that the Georgians would not return to South Ossetia, which would be under Russian control.</p> <p>\"They shot their brother Russian peacekeepers, then they finished them off with bayonets, so we are not going to see them there any more,\" said Dmitri Rogozin, Russia's ambassador to Nato in Brussels.</p> <p>Medvedev spoke by phone with the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana and told him \"there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire,\" said a European official.</p> <p>\"The Russians are saying that they will never again accept Georgians in any form in South Ossetia. They see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week.\" While Nato leaders in Brussels stressed that South Ossetia and Abkhazia were part of Georgia, Medvedev encouraged the secession of the two breakaway regions.</p> <p>\"Ossetians and Abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account, including what happened in the past few days,\" he said.</p> <p>Western officials at Nato, in the EU, in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and in Washington, while calling for an immediate ceasefire, also demanded that Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity be upheld.</p> <p>Following a meeting of Nato states on the crisis Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the Nato secretary general, accused Russia of not respecting Georgia's territorial integrity. \"Abkhazia and Ossetia, if I mention territorial integrity, are to the best of my knowledge part of Georgia.\" He added that \"Nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict.\"</p> <p>For several months, said European officials, Saakashvili has rejected pressure to commit to forgoing the use of force in the territorial disputes. But Lavrov said the Georgian army would have to be returned to bases and that any peace deal would \"require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non-use of force.\"</p> <p>The Russians also agreed to withdraw troops from Georgia and return their \"peacekeeping\" contingent to positions held before the fighting. But until the monitoring of the proposed ceasefire was up and running, the Russians reserved the right to take unspecified \"additional security measures\" in Georgia.</p> <p>While thousands rallied in support of Saakashvili tonight outside the parliament building in Tbilisi, there was a growing sense among many Georgians that the leader's decision to attack South Ossetia had been a disastrous blunder - with Russia's overwhelming military response both predictable and highly costly.</p> <p>\"Why are people waving flags? It's not as if we won,\" Lasha Darkveldze, 23, said as supporters thronged the centre of Tbilisi and marched on its freedom square. \"Saakashvili should now resign.\"</p> <p>\"We hope he is going to disappear from Georgia,\" Bacha Janashia, a 24-year-old student said. \"I really wonder why he did it. He has only 10,000 soldiers and he takes on Russia.\"</p> <p>If the Russian terms are demeaning, Saakashvili's bargaining position is now extremely weak given the virtual disintegration of his armed forces. Abandoned tanks and armoured personnel carriers litter the road between Tbilisi and Gori - dumped following Russia's swift advance deep into Georgia yesterday.</p> <p>The country's radar stations and air defences have been pulverised and many reservists have gone home. This morning a solitary Georgian tank was visible on the main road to the frontline, three miles outside the capital.</p> <p>In Gori, Russia's ceasefire appeared to be holding this afternoon after numerous air attacks. Russian planes bombed the town this morning - killing at least five civilians including a Dutch TV journalist.</p>",
  "<p> There has always been something massively disingenuous about Eidos celebrating each new episode of Tomb Raider - a series ostensibly based around a strong iconic female character - with a raunchy photoshoot featuring some anonymous ing\u00e9nue. But anyway, the company has revealed the latest real-life Lara - and, hey, in tune with the series' move away from its big-chested past - she's not just a thrusting young model-turned-actress. No, she's <a href=\"http://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/lara/alisoncarroll/index.html\">Alison Carroll</a>, 'a BGA accredited Club Coach in Tumbling, Sports Acrobatics, and General Gymnastics', according to the <a href=\"http://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/headlines3488.html\">official site</a>. From GameDaily:</p> <blockquote> <br> <p>As part of the role, Carroll is now \"studying\" the movements of Lara Croft and she's training in survival, combat and semi-automatic weapons. She's also taking archeology coursework to better understand the mythology and exploration themes present throughout the Tomb Raider franchise.</p> </blockquote> <br> <p>This will no doubt prove invaluable as she spends the year posing awkwardly with dual pistols at a series of photoshoots and disturbing live appearances.</p> <p>But of course, as we all know, it's been a long time since anyone <em>really, really</em> cared about Lara Croft. Yeah, Underworld looks pretty impressive, but it's going to take the mother of all archeological adventures to make us forget some of the wretched slop Core Design served up before Eidos bundled Croft into the back of a fast car and dropped her off at Crystal Dynamics.</p> <p>Thing is, for a long time, developers failed to find something - or someone - to fill the Lara-shaped vacuum in the release line-up. I wasn't sure about Nariko, whose terminal status ensured she retained the victim complex so often prescribed to female characters. Meanwhile, ongoing DOA and Soul Calibur installments have been mere exercises in lascivious wish-fulfillment.</p> <p>But now there's something resembling an embarrassment of riches - rather than just an embarrassment. Against the new generation Lara is looking rather dated. Take for example, <a href=\"http://www.sega.com/platinumgames/bayonetta/EnglishUSA/\">Bayonetta</a>, the insane witch hard-ass and titular star of Sega's forthcoming hack 'n' slash odyessy. She clutches two pistols but she also has revolvers bolted to her ankles and attacks enemies with her Medusa-like hair, which transforms into weapons to beat enemy monsters to horrible death. She's not a trite feminist icon, she's an elemental, mythical force, part harpy, part Grendel's mother. Which is a lot more interesting and challenging than an ex-public school girl in shorts.</p> <p>Faith from DICE's futuristic free-running adventure <a href=\"http://www.mirrorsedge.com/\">Mirror's Edge</a> is interesting both for her narrative role as a dissident activist operating against a totalitarian regime, and for her physical presence. It's a first-person title, but the view is skewed so that in combat and acrobatics, body parts fling into view. There's a sense of ownership, of identification with the character, that Lara's third-person viewpoint actively avoids. Her ambiguous ethnicity also globalises the character - she is much more 21st Century than Croft.</p> <p>It's a little too early to speculate on Sheva Alomar, Chris Redfield's African partner in Resident Evil 5, but again, her background as a mentally scarred anti-terrorist operative brings her into sharp contrast with Core's primly conceived intellectual princess.</p> <p>Ultimately, Lara Croft symbolises the hope, the empty confidence, of the late-nineties. She's a new Labour poster girl. She's a Blair's babe. But we know that's all vacuous and empty now - and as a feminist icon she's always been on shaky ground. Faith and Bayonetta, on the other hand, are interesting embodiments of Donna Haraway's <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html\">Cyborg manifesto</a> - transgressive, post-race, post-human. A long way from posh pouts and pistols.</p>",
  "<p>As the battle for control of the Arctic's energy resources heats up, the US is partnering with its territorial rival Canada for a cruise to map areas of the oil-rich continental shelf.</p> <p>In addition to the Canadian cruise next month, the US state department is slated to launch a preliminary voyage tomorrow that will use echo-sounder technology to produce a 3D map of the Chukchi Cap, located about 600 miles north of Alaska.</p> <p>The two cruises by the US coast guard cutter ship Healy mark the fourth year of America's efforts to claim a share of the expansive oil reserves in the Arctic. One-fifth of the world's available and untapped fuel is located in the far north, the US government estimates.</p> <p>Data collected from the Healy's cruises will be publicly released and \"provide greater scientific insight into relatively unexplored regions of the ocean,\" the state department said this week.</p> <p>The voyages also could mark a new era of cooperation between the US and Canada, which are vying with Russia and Denmark to control parts of the Arctic seafloor. Russia's planting of a flag on the North Pole last year marked an escalation of the underwater land race.</p> <p>The Healy's findings could further enflame the politically charged debate over drilling in protected areas of the Arctic and the US coasts, depending on the data uncovered by the cruise.</p> <p>But the US-Canada cruise is primarily an alliance to aid both countries' scientific goals. Canada brings a seismic mapping system to the table hat uses sea sediments to measure the seafloor, while the Healy brings superior ice-breaking power to the venture.</p> <p>Even if the US can make a case for ownership of Arctic land beyond 200 miles off the Alaskan coast, ratification of the UN law of the sea treaty is likely necessary to formalise a claim. The US is the only nation hunting for Arctic resources that has yet to approve the treaty.</p>",
  "<p>The bomb fell without warning, landing across the road from Tamaz Beruashvili's home. It narrowly missed Gori's town hall and the giant statue of Stalin. But it hit Misha's friend Gocha Sekhniashvili. He had been standing in the main square.</p> <p>\"The bomb came down suddenly. Our windows blew in. Everyone's windows shattered. People were screaming, and dying. Others were hiding,\" Tamaz, 47, said. \"I grabbed our bags and ran. I saw Gocha lying face down in the rubble.\"<br> Russian fighter jets pounded Gori again this morning for the fifth day in a row. Russia's president Dmitry Medvedev said that the \"aggressor\" Georgia had now been \"punished\". But it wasn't clear what Gocha had done to deserve his fate.</p> <p>The strike killed at least five civilians. They included a Dutch TV journalist, Stan Storimans, 39, who had been working near the square's grandiose Stalin museum \u2014 built next to the modest two-room wooden home where the dictator grew up.</p> <p>These latest civilian deaths happened just before president Medvedev appeared on TV, announcing that Russian forces were halting military operations. Their advance deep into Georgia's west and centre was over, he suggested.</p> <p>On the ground it didn't feel much like that. As Medvedev spoke, a Russian helicopter gunship loomed in the white sky near the village of Nasreti, 8 miles outside Gori, and close to South Ossetia, the rebel statelet seized and abandoned on Sunday by Georgian forces.</p> <p>The gunship loosed off several orange-fizzing rockets. They plunged into a line of tall electricity pylons, sending a plume rising across the main highway, and along the shimmering mountain valley that links the east and west of Georgia.</p> <p>Along the road were signs of the Georgian army's panicked and ignominious retreat early Monday evening \u2014 after Russian troops rolled in from South Ossetia to the edge of Gori. An incinerated Georgian tank lay on a verge. Its roof had been sliced off.</p> <p>Other Georgian military vehicles appeared to have merely conked out during their hapless retreat. One tank had two flat back tyres; its crew had left behind their apples next to the gun turret. A pair of military trucks had concertina-ed head-on. Nearby a piece of artillery had been dumped.</p> <p>Villagers on the frontline were left bewildered today at Russia's war with Georgia. \"I don't know which side to blame. I don't even know why this has happened,\" Olya Tvauri, 73, from Nasreti, said. </p> <p>Olya and the other women and children had spent the night in a neighbour's cellar. The men had fled to the mountains, concealing themselves among the fir trees. The Russian bombers turned up at 2am \u2014 pounding Gori's post office and military hospital, and killing its doctor.</p> <p>Olya returned to her house covered in vines \u2014 with its chickens, plum trees, and courgettes bursting into bright yellow flower. \"I'm an Ossetian. But I prefer to live here,\" she said.</p> <p>Others were trudging on foot towards Tbilisi. Russia's feared advance on the Georgian capital hadn't happened. But most residents living along the road had taken no chances. They fled. \"The soldiers told us to go and hide,\" Natela Tlasadze, 41, said, lugging her possessions to the neighbouring village.</p> <p>The cost of Georgia's ill-fated adventure against Vladimir Putin was beginning to sink in. Many blamed Georgia's president Mikhail Saakashvili \u2014 querying why he had taken on mighty Moscow given Georgia's military inferiority and the improbability of US intervention.</p> <p>\"Saakashvili has to resign. There is no other way,\" Misha Iashvili said, stopping to mend his truck next to a roadside caf\u00e9. Its owners had gone, locking up and leaving behind their neat dahlia garden. He added: \"Russia had been close to us for years. It will defend us. The US and Europe won't.\" </p> <p>By this afternoon the Russian ceasefire appeared to be holding \u2014 with the bombardment of Gori apparently over. A dead dog lay in the road; in the blown-out square a wrecked red Golf sat amid glass and debris. Stalin's statue appeared supernaturally undamaged; the Georgian flag hung from the unoccupied municipal hall. </p> <p>Back in Tbilisi, Saakashvili defiantly addressed several thousand supporters who gathered this afternoon outside the parliament building. They cheered him and the Georgian national anthem, waving flags and marching down the road to Freedom Square. One placard showed Putin with the slogan: \"Wanted: crimes against humanity and the world.\"</p> <p>But among many the mood was sceptical. Georgia had taken on the Russian war machine \u2014 and lost. \"Why did [Saakashvili] take on Russia with 10,000 soldiers? Maybe he was thinking somebody would help us. But nobody did help us,\" Bacho Janashia, a 24-year-old student said. \"We hope Saakashvili disappears from Georgia. He's a bastard.\" </p> <p>As dusk fell on Gori, two old ladies were trying to hitch a ride out; a fleet of fire engines arrived. \"I don't know whether Gocha lived or died,\" Tamaz Beruashvili said. \"He was covered in blood. There was no time to find out. But he wasn't moving.\"</p>",
  "<p>Talks to resolve Zimbabwe's political crisis were on the brink of collapse tonight as Robert Mugabe refused to surrender control of the government, despite losing the country's last credible election.</p> <p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who has been mediating the negotiations, was making a final push to reach agreement before heading back to Pretoria. </p> <p>But the two sides remained far apart as the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, continued to insist that democracy be respected.</p> <p>Mbeki arrived on Sunday with his aides predicting an agreement within the day in the hope that a new government and parliament would be installed this week, permitting Mbeki to claim a success at a regional heads of government summit in Johannesburg this weekend. </p> <p>But although Tsvangirai had endorsed a plan for Mugabe to remain president with a largely ceremonial function, the opposition said it became apparent Zimbabwe's ruler for the 28 years since independence did not intend to give up power. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is trying to reach a deal with the leader of a small breakaway Movement for Democratic Change faction, Arthur Mutambara, whose 10 seats in parliament hold the balance of power. Mutambara's statements in recent days indicate that he is receptive to Mugabe's overtures. </p> <p>But even if Mugabe were to draw Mutambara in, and then claim to have formed a coalition government with the opposition, it is unlikely to open the door to the foreign money needed to stabilise Zimbabwe's wrecked economy, collapsing under the weight of inflation likely to rise to about 50m% this month. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch today said the state-orchestrated campaign of violence that crushed support for Tsvangirai in June's presidential run-off election, after he won the first round of voting three months earlier, had claimed the lives of at least 163 opposition activists and supporters.

  "<p>It is hard to determine who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">behaved worse</a>. The Georgians for tearing up a peace agreement and flattening the centre of an Ossetian town, or the Russians for visiting, and revisiting, similar horrors on the Georgian inhabitants of Gali in Abkhazia and Gori, in the north.</p> <p>In spite of what Georgia says, the most likely outcome of strike and counterstrike will be a return to the borders of both breakaway states, with some changes of the boundary lines. Georgia will have lost its claim over these disputed territories for good and a heavy Russian military presence will seal this territorial settlement for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>But the consequences of a short war in the Caucasus do not stop there. Successive Russian leaders, men lauded as reformers and democrats, as well as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3587717.stm\">today's generation</a> of autocrats, have warned the west about the dangers of Nato's eastward expansion. Whether it was Gorbachev with Thatcher, Yeltsin with Clinton or Putin with Bush, the message was essentially the same: push the line of confrontation eastwards and eventually Russia will push back. This is now what has happened. A sleepy and eminently vulnerable town nestling in the foothills of the Caucasus mountains has been made an object lesson of the limits of western political and military expansion.</p> <p>Russia is not concerned about the fate of breakaway regimes. By rattling Georgia's cage, Moscow is sending a message that reaches far beyond the presidential office of Mikheil Saakashvili in Tbilisi. If you are serious, Russia is saying, about extending Nato membership to Georgia or Ukraine, the price of doing that will be a major western military investment guarding these new borders. Put up or shut up.</p> <p>The Russian prescription for managing the patchwork of rival nationalities in southern Russia and amoung Russia's neighbours belongs to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck\">Bismarck</a> and is firmly rooted in the 19th century. It's about power and spheres of influence.</p> <p>But the western model which blithely assumes that every pro-western leader has almost by definition to be a democrat, also leaves something to be desired. What would happen if the events of South Ossetia were repeated in Ukraine? This is not a fanciful or malicious notion. The flood of proclamations from Moscow and Tbilisi over the last few days all but obscured one small, but significant, announcement from Kiev. In it, Ukraine warned Russia it could bar <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jiafUbbRzef5Bap4RvqbtLjfj_vgD92FC68O0\">Russian navy ships</a> from returning to their base in the Crimea because of their deployment to Georgia's coast. </p> <p>This revisits the long and bitter dispute Russia had with Ukraine over the division of the Black Sea fleet and the agreement to use Sevastopol which runs out in 2017. The Russians want to renew the base agreement and the government in Kiev does not. At issue here is not just the fate of Russia's Black Sea fleet but the identity of Crimea, a vociferously pro-Russian enclave. But it's not just Crimea. The whole industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine is pulled between a Russian and a Ukrainian identity. Even 15 years on, for a Ukrainian living in Donetsk with relatives in Moscow, the border with Russia is a nonsense. In his mind, it should not be there.</p> <p>Putin warned Nato leaders at their last conference that if Ukraine got Nato membership, it would disintegrate as a country. Was he bullying or telling the truth? Probably, a bit of both. If Ukraine became a battleground of competing 19th century nationalisms as Georgia has become, it could easily become a new Yugoslavia. Does Europe or Nato have the troops to police the new boundaries and enclaves of Ukraine that would emerge as a result? Almost definitely not.</p> <p>The counterargument to almost all of the above comes from eastern Europe and the Baltic states. For honourable reasons, and with deeply held beliefs, they argue that Nato's eastward expansion, coupled with the prospect of EU membership, is the sole guarantor of independence. To recognise that Russia sees the protection of Russian-speaking people scattered throughout the region as a casus belli is little more than appeasement, they argue. Trust us, they say. We, the victims of Soviet occupation, know the mentality of our former occupiers well. Stand up to them and they will back down. Force is the only thing Russians understand. A senior Lithuanian diplomat deployed this argument at a private seminar in London recently, three weeks before the Georgian crisis blew up. All Europe needed to do, he said, was to put a token police force in Abkhazia and the Russians would back off. Would he still be saying that now, I wonder?</p> <p>The eastern European model for dealing with a resurgent nationalist Russia has worked for them, although all states are vulnerable to cuts in the Russian oil and gas supply. But that model, I argue, is a recipe for war and disintegration in the former Soviet space. Not because it is Russia's backyard, but because it is Russia's breaker's yard.</p> <p>The fear that lurked in Russian minds when Kosovo's independence was recognised by many European governments, had nothing to do with the Kosovo Albanians or the Serbs, for whom Russia's leaders care little. It had to do with the thought of what would happen to the Russian Federation if Tartars or any other ethnic minorities (of which there are hundreds) did the same. Russia's show of strength in Georgia is the surest indicator of Russia's territorial vulnerability. </p> <p>The west's response to the Georgian crisis should not be to re-erect fresh lines of confrontation through the middle of Ukraine, or along the Caucasus mountain range. It should not be to install \"pipeline police\" guarding the oil pipeline from Baku. It should not be to establish major military bases along that new border: the proposed US missile defence radar in the Czech Republic has a strategic military significance far beyond the reach of the host nation. It should be to localise conflicts, blur divisions, share control of strategic military resources, and keep borders open.</p> <p>This is not appeasement, nor even realpolitik, nor even an abandonment of democratic principles. On the contrary, every time events follow the mindset of the hawks in the Kremlin, Russia's dwindling band of democrats gets smaller still and the possibility of regime change in Moscow is set back another generation. The surest way of keeping hawks in the Kremlin is to keep advancing eastwards. It is a recipe for war, which Europe has no will to fight.</p>",
  "<p>The Kremlin's decision today to call a halt to its five-day assault on Georgia leaves Russia calling the shots in the energy-rich Black Sea littoral and Caspian basin.</p> <p>The quick and easy victory exposes the west's lack of leverage over a resurgent Russia despite years of heavy American political investment in Georgia.</p> <p>In the tussle for supremacy in a vital strategic region, the balance has tilted. Russia has successfully deployed its firepower in another country with impunity for the first time since communism's collapse.</p> <p>\"This is not the Russia of 93 or 94, a terribly weakened Russia,\" said a European official. \"The Russians are now negotiating from a position of strength.\"</p> <p>The impact of Mikheil Saakashvili's rash gamble storming South Ossetia last week and of Vladimir Putin's comprehensive rout of the Georgians will ripple in many directions.</p> <p>In less than a week, Putin has redrawn the geopolitical map of the contested region between Russia, Turkey, and Iran.</p> <p>\"We don't look very good,\" said a former Pentagon official long involved in Georgia. \"We've been working on [Georgia] for four years and we've failed. Everyone's guilty. But Putin is playing his cards brilliantly. He knows exactly what he's doing and the consequences are all negative.\"</p> <p>While Russia walks tall, Saakashvili will struggle to survive as one of the world's youngest presidents. The Europeans are already divided and vulnerable to charges of indecision and impotence. Nato splits over Georgia and Ukraine will widen. American policies in the region have been severely set back. Western energy policy is looking flaky.</p> <p>\"This was a proxy war, not about South Ossetia, but about Moscow drawing a red line for the west,\" said Alexander Rahr, Russia expert at Germany's Council on Foreign Relations and a biographer of Putin. \"They marched into Georgia to challenge the west. And the west was powerless. We're dealing with a new Russia.\"</p> <p><strong>Ceasefire</strong></p> <p>Following President Dmitri Medvedev's call for a halt today, the first priority is a proper ceasefire. That has to be agreed, then implemented, then monitored, all very tricky with ample scope for further confusion, breakdown and bloodshed.</p> <p>Moscow is dictating the terms. According to European officials briefed on today's talks in Moscow with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, the Russians are insisting on an end to 15 years of Georgian troops being part of the peacekeeping contingent in breakaway South Ossetia and are demanding that Saakashvili sign a legally binding pledge abjuring the use of all armed force in relation to the two pro-Russian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p> <p>In recent months, Saakashvili has repeatedly refused to sign such a commitment. \"Russia seems to have all the cards,\" said another European official. \"Russian soldiers have been in South Ossetia and Abkhazia for 15 years. The outcome of the negotiations will probably be the entrenchment of the Russian presence in both of the enclaves.\"</p> <p><strong>Saakashvili</strong></p> <p>Such an outcome leaves the 40-year-old Georgian president wounded, perhaps fatally. Moscow has already launched a concerted propaganda offensive painting the Georgian leader as a war criminal and using analogies from the Balkan wars to accuse him of \"genocide\". The Russians will control South Ossetia and send in military prosecutors to find evidence of atrocities. Moscow wants rid of him. Character assassination and secret service shenanigans will increase doubts about Saakashvili at home and abroad in the Russian hope that Saakashvili's own electorate will turn against him, although there is no obvious successor.</p> <p>Saakashvili has enjoyed strong American support. \"He has to be protected at all costs,\" said the former Pentagon official. But many European governments are lukewarm about him, regarding Saakashvili as \"his own worst enemy\" and are hoping that Barack Obama will distance himself from the Georgian president.</p> <p><strong>The price of victory</strong></p> <p>If the Kremlin is celebrating an apparent win-win situation, much of the world has been appalled at Russia's invasion of a small defenceless neighbour. How will the west respond?</p> <p>Obama has talked of blocking Russia's ambition to join the World Trade Organisation. There have been calls to throw Russia out of the G8. Some of the former Soviet satellites in eastern Europe now in the EU are calling on Brussels to freeze negotiations with Moscow on a new long-term partnership pact.</p> <p>But with a surfeit of petro-dollars in the bank and its fingers on the energy valves that keep Europe warm, the Kremlin appears blithely contemptuous of any potential western retribution. Relations between Russia and the west are already poor and will worsen further, but there are unlikely to be any concrete penalties.</p> <p>\"What can have an impact on the Russians without damaging us more than them,\" asked one of the European officials.</p> <p><strong>Nato and the EU</strong></p> <p>The Russians see the Caucasus test as a zero-sum game and have won. That means lose-lose for the west. A key objective for Putin was to destabilise Georgia to invalidate its aim of joining Nato. He may have succeeded.</p> <p>The Americans suffered a rare defeat in April at a Nato summit when George Bush argued strongly for starting Georgia towards alliance membership and was defeated by Angela Merkel of Germany and Sarkozy of France.</p> <p>\"This is the first time ever that an American president's request was rejected because France and Germany stuck together,\" said a senior source at the Elysee Palace in Paris.</p> <p>In a tough statement yesterday, John McCain said the Nato rebuff to Georgia \"might have been viewed as a green light by Russia for its attacks on Georgia. I urge the Nato allies to revisit the decision.\"</p> <p>But the French and the Germans feel vindicated in rejecting Georgia and are unlikely to bend.</p> <p>\"A country that has such problems and is led by a hot-headed militant does not belong in Nato,\" said Rahr in Berlin. \"It could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war.\"</p> <p>EU foreign ministers meet tomorrow in Brussels on Georgia, but are riven over how to respond. </p> <p>\"The spectrum of views in the EU is very wide. It ranges from cold warriors to appeasers,\" said one of the European officials. \"It will be hard to get a consensus.\"</p> <p>Four EU leaders from the Baltic states and Poland went to Tbilisi today to show solidarity with Georgia and denounce the Russian \"imperialism\" they have all been victims of in the past.</p> <p>The Italian government, by contrast, said it was \"close to Putin's position. This war has pushed Georgia further away from Europe.\"</p>",
  "<p>Abortion rights supporters today launched a campaign to defeat a proposed ban on the procedure in the state of South Dakota, citing potentially sweeping ramifications for US healthcare policy.</p> <p>A coalition of advocacy groups - led by Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) - denounced this year's South Dakota abortion ballot initiative as the first step towards undoing Roe v Wade, the 1973 US supreme court ruling that preserved abortion rights.</p> <p>\"The measure in South Dakota would allow politicians to interfere with personal decisions best made by women and their families,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in a statement.</p> <p>The South Dakota ban is similar to a 2006 ballot measure that voters rejected, 56% to 44%, prompting speculation that the era of dominant social conservatism was on the wane in America.</p> <p>But public coolness to that ban appeared to rest with its lack of exceptions for women impregnated by incest or rape as well as women whose pregnancies endanger their health. Even George Bush, a fervent abortion opponent, signalled he disagreed with the ban's restrictive nature.</p> <p>The new South Dakota proposal includes the three key exceptions, and its authors believe the changes can ensure its passage. </p> <p>Critics of this year's ban, such as Planned Parenthood action fund president Cecile Richards, believe the exceptions are drawn up so as to ensure their ineffectiveness. Richards said the ban's authors have falsely depicted it as an improvement on the 2006 measure.</p> <p>\"They are being deceptive by characterising this proposed law as more reasonable and less restrictive,\" Richards said in a statement. \"[T]he truth is that this ban would be the most rigid and inflexible ban on abortion in the United States.\"</p> <p>The measure is unlikely to sway South Dakota's presidential vote, but its ramifications will be felt in the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain. </p> <p>McCain has twice called for the Republican party platform - which opposes abortion - to carve out the rape, incest and health-based exceptions for women seeking the procedure. </p> <p>Yet ABC news reported in May that social conservatives were pressuring McCain against trying to change the platform before Republicans nominate him next month in St Paul, Minnesota. McCain has yet to publicly embrace the South Dakota ban, which could be seen as a defence of his previous stance on the platform.</p> <p>The McCain camp did not return a request for his stance on the South Dakota ballot measure.</p> <p>If the ban is approved in November, the South Dakota state government has warned that it \"will likely be challenged in court\" as unconstitutional. </p> <p>Another state-level referendum is facing the same fate in Colorado, where voters are being asked whether human \"personhood\" begins at conception. If passed, that measure would make Colorado the first state to outlaw abortion outright since the Roe court ruling.</p> <p>The Colorado ban has secured endorsements from \"over 70\" anti-abortion physicians, according to its backers. But in the state's closely fought Senate race, both Democratic candidate Mark Udall and self-described \"pro-life\" Republican Bob Schaffer are opposing the ban.</p> <p>\"I think there are other strategies and tactics that get us far closer to advancing the cause of human life,\" Schaffer told a local Colorado radio station this month.</p>",
  "<p>In the conflict in the Caucasus, Russia has plenty of tanks, troops and planes. Georgia has a small army and Mikhail Saakashvili, its voluble and media-friendly president.</p> <p>Saakashvili has waged a one-man battle for public opinion, popping up daily on TV screens as if his words can make a difference against the might of the Russian army. The appearances are short but never fail to yield a sound bite for the world's media.</p> <p>Today, the American-educated Saakashvili sounded almost Churchillian. No matter how much Russia tries to undermine us, he said, we will never surrender. His rhetoric was even starker yesterday when he accused Russia of trying to \"murder a small country\". </p> <p>As if to reinforce the image of \"plucky Georgia\" fighting against the odds, there have been TV images of the Georgian president, wearing a flak jacket, bundled away by his security guards during a visit to Gori as Russian aircraft buzzed overhead.</p> <p>After Russia retaliated with great force to Georgia's sally into South Ossetia last Thursday, Saakashvili has sought to portray the conflict in the most apocalyptic terms, depicting the Georgians as the victims of a resurgent Russia intent on crushing nascent democracies on its border. The doom-and-gloom rhetoric is designed to win world sympathy in a conflict where there is a total mismatch between the Russian and Georgian armed forces.</p> <p>The dashing Saakashvili certainly cuts a more sympathetic figure than the dour Vladimir Putin, the Russian prime minister, or his sidekick, the nondescript president Dmitry Medvedev. Saakashvili's one-man campaign has been effective to a point. His frequent appearances keep Georgia in the news and his statements helps to put his country in the best possible light.</p> <p>His reward has been sympathetic words of support from the US, the EU and Nato. But the west has little to offer other than statements of support for Georgia coupled with denunciations of Russian ruthlessness. The US is on the sidelines, leaving the EU and its current president, the energetic Nicolas Sarkozy, to make the diplomatic running.</p> <p>It is fitting that Saaskashvili has led the propaganda battle as it was his decision to take back the breakaway province of South Ossetia that precipitated the crisis that could spell the return of Georgia to Russian control.</p> <p>So far, Georgians have rallied in support of their leader in the face of the Russian onslaught, but once the dust has settled, they might well decide that having a man all too ready to take risks on their behalf is not such a good idea. Moreover, despite his self-portrait as a democrat, Saaskashvili, who succeeded Eduard Shevardnadze in the so-called rose revolution in 2003, has an authoritarian streak.</p> <p>Although Saakashvili and his small circle of young advisers have won kudos for battling corruption in Georgia and boosting the economy, political opponents have been thrown into jail under his presidency. Last year, he surprised his American backers by declaring a 15-day state of emergency after battles between riot police and demonstrators protesting against the postponement of parliamentary elections. Those critics are quiet for now. But once the crisis subsides, it should come as no surprise if the knives come out once more following Saakashvilis's misadventure in South Ossetia.</p>",
  "<p>The sky was heavy with rain. Gunmetal grey streaked with white, distant lightening. Armorikot's big day had come. The village primary school and the heavens were going to open at the same time \u2013 and both were going to be equally welcome.</p> <p>The rains in Katine sub-county in rural Uganda have been capricious all year, beyond the control even of such a faithful community as this. But the school is the result of the tough persistence of a small group of villagers determined to see their children live out lives less perilous than their own.</p> <p>The Guardian is tracking a three-year development project, in partnership with Barclays, to improve the lives of the 25,000 people in Katine. The project is being delivered by the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref).</p> <p>There's been a community school here \u2013 one set up by the local people and mostly funded by them \u2013 off and on for twenty years. More off than on, as the terrible sequence of what everyone here calls 'the wars' ebbed and flowed around them.</p> <p>During the Lord's Resistance Army incursion in 2003, the villagers \u2013 spread out across several square miles of open country \u2013 fled to Soroti's displaced people's camp and for months relied on inadequate food handouts in squalid surroundings.</p> <p>This afternoon, as the storm edged closer, Moses Olek, chair of the school management committee, reminded fellow parents how families with educated children had been able to find ways of making enough money to escape the camp. His audience, beginning to tug their wraps around them against the gusty wind, had had nothing, and they were given little more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336565501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/08/12/Katine-school-article-crowd.jpg\" alt=\"Katine school article crowd\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katine villagers attend the opening of Amorikot school. Photograph: Anne Perkins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Perkins/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was when Moses Olek, Faustino Ameca and a small group of others decided they would somehow educate their children, at a school even the youngest could reach. By April 2004 they had somehow managed to find 500,000 Ugandan shillings ($300) to buy a block of land where they could rebuild their school. It is not a large amount of money, but at least 70 of those families are still living on less than a dollar a day. There would have been many more, four years ago.</p> <p>Encouraged by the district education officer, they built a handful of classrooms, huts really, as well as a school office, and began with about 240 children: now there are 400. But getting their children to school was still a knife-edge struggle for most families. Until the government takes the school over, the parents have to pay for most of the teaching staff. They charge fees of 3,000 Ugandan shillings \u2013 about US$2 \u2013 a term. It made a mockery of the Ugandan government's commitment to universal free primary education. And for someone like Raymond Ereda, it meant educating the ten orphans in his charge (the children of two of his sons) was out of the question.</p> <p>Last year, Amref chose Armorikot for its first major investment. It was chosen against half a dozen other community village schools not only because the need was there, but because of the work the village itself had already done.</p> <p>In just eight months, and with an investment of nearly 173m shillings, seven classrooms and a small suite of school offices have been built. Less glamorously, but just as importantly, so has an Ecosan pit latrine. If the kids learn about hygiene and sanitation at school, as one of the celebratory speakers said, \"then they'll go home and tell the old people about it.\"</p> <p>The opening of the school was a great occasion. There was coca-cola. A bullock was slaughtered. There were quite a lot of speeches from almost every tier of Uganda's complex local government. But this was a moment to celebrate the achievement of just 500 families, and it built fittingly to a climax.</p> <p>Moments before the rain came down, the boss of bosses, chair of the Soroti District Council, self-styled governor Stephen Ochola, gave the school the guarantee it most needed: registration before the end of the year. Free school for the people of Armorikot. As Amref handed over the keys to the district council, the rains came down. Good news for everyone.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's hopes of converting the bronze position they held after the cross country into silver or gold during the final show jumping discipline of the three-day event were always based more on optimism than reality, and they duly had to settle for what will be viewed as a disappointing team bronze behind Germany, who won the gold, and the Australian silver medal winners. However, there was better news for the British later on, when Kristina Cook claimed bronze in the individual event, behind Germany's Hinrich Romeike and American Gina Miles.</p> <p>The Germans were understandably elated. Four years ago in Athens, on an evening of sustained chaos, Germany's Bettina Hoy rode a seemingly flawless round, only to be penalised for crossing the starting line twice. An appeal rescinded that penalty, and Hoy left Athens with both the team and individual gold medals. Then, three days later, the Court for Arbitration in Sport overturned Germany's appeal, leaving both Hoy and her team-mates without any medals whatsoever. To say they were on a mission here would be something of an understatement.</p> <p>Britain had benefited from the ruling, with their team being upgraded from bronze to silver, and Leslie Law winning an unlikely individual gold. But there were no such dramas here. The Germans and the Australians rode quite beautifully, leaving Britain with no chance of closing the gap. This left them with the necessity of protecting the bronze medal against any challenge from Italy, and this they managed comfortably enough with Cook's clear round on Miners Frolic making doubly sure before the Italians self-imploded anyway.</p> <p>However, Britain had arrived here with high hopes of winning their first team gold since the 1972 Munich Games when Richard Meade established himself as one of the all-time great Olympians, winning team and individual gold to add to his team gold in Mexico City four years earlier. To this extent their pleasure at winning a medal was understandably diluted.</p> <p>The absence of Zara Phillips, the reigning world champion, contributed to Britain's less than scintillating showing, her horse Toytown being ruled out earlier this summer when the gelding went lame. Neither did the five British riders perform well in the opening dressage section, and after Sunday's cross-country Germany and Australia already had more than half grip on the gold and silver respectively.</p> <p>Yogi Breisner, the British team manager, had continued to remain optimistic, citing Athens as a night when the impossible became possible. That was never really likely on this occasion, and he and the team knew it.</p>",
  "<p><br>Not fading into the background: John Prescott in Edinburgh today.

Could he be a good leader for the party? \"In time,\" replied Prescott. \"If that happens. We have one member one vote in this party. There is a process for that.\"</p> <p>He said that Labour had lost the trust of the electorate, but he said, \"If we get things right we could win the next elections. But we need people's trust. The fact that we lost people's trust is reflected in the polls and by-elections ... we need to remind people what we stand for and then put the Tories on a bit of a run. We are looking inside, not outside, at the moment.</p> <p>\"We need to get back on track, follow the values we had in the first part and point out what we've done ... Some people do believe it's time for a change, and that can be quite a powerful political process.\"</p> <p>Turning to lighter subjects, he talked of his reputation as John \"Two Jags\" Prescott.</p> <p>\"First of all, I only had one,\" he said. \"One of them was a government car. Then I had my own XJS. People said you can't be transport minister and have a Jag. I said, make me culture minister. That would have been a bit of a shock.</p> <p>\"I never had a new one; you could get them second hand off the Exchange and Mart.</p> <p>\"Funnily enough I have become a two Jags man now.

There are actually two balls and you have to hit them together.</p>",
  "<h2>Why has fighting broken out?</h2> <p>The South Ossetians and Georgians have been sniping at each other for several weeks, and patience on both sides has finally snapped. Along with Georgia's other breakaway region, Abkhazia, South Ossetia has enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s, but Tbilisi has never recognised the loss of its territory. The dispute between Georgia and the two regions was called \"the frozen conflict\" because the issues remain unresolved, but there was no fighting. The heat began to rise this year when the west recognised Kosovo, against Russia's advice. The South Ossetians and Abkhazians argued that if Kosovo could be independent, then so could they.</p> <h2>What is the basis of the region's claim to independence?</h2> <p>The Ossetians are descendants of a tribe called the Alans. Like the Georgians, the Ossetians are Orthodox Christians, but they have their own language. In Soviet times, the Ossetians had an autonomous region within Georgia. The Georgians say the Ossetians cooperated with the Bolsheviks and tended to be more pro-Soviet. Their ethnic kin live across the border in the Russian region of North Ossetia, so today they feel more drawn to Russia than to Georgia, and many have Russian passports.</p> <p>Abkhazia, on the Black Sea coast, was also an autonomous region of Georgia in Soviet times. It has a mixed population of Abkhaz, Mingrelians, Greeks, Armenians, Russians and Georgians, and a small but significant Muslim minority. Thousands of ethnic Georgians fled their homes in Abkhazia during the civil war in the early 90s and now live as refugees in Tbilisi and Moscow.</p> <h2>Why did Georgia attack in South Ossetia?</h2> <p>On Thursday, Georgian forces launched a surprise attack and briefly took the South Osssetian capital, Tskhinvali. Georgia said it had made the assault in order to stop separatist fighters attacking civilians. The attack followed months of what Georgia described as Russian provocation, including the firing of Russian missiles at Georgian territory. Russia also cut off air service and mail between the two countries, and refused Georgian exports. </p> <p>Georgia may have hoped that with Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, away in Beijing, it could successfully reassert control of Ossetia with a minimum of fuss. If so, it was a colossal miscalculation: the Russians retaliated with massive force and the tiny Georgian army was soon forced to pull back from South Ossetia as Russian forces pressed home their advantage to penetrate Georgia proper.</p> <p>Russia says it has stopped all operations, but there are still reports of military activity.</p> <h2>Why did Russia react so strongly?</h2> <p>Russia says it cannot stand aside because many of the people in the breakaway regions are its citizens. Resorting to apocalyptic rhetoric, Russia has accused Georgia of committing genocide, drawing comparisons with Srebrenica, in the former Yugoslavia, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were massacred by Serbs during the Bosnia war. </p> <p>Georgia, for its part, accuses Russia of meddling in its internal affairs and supporting the separatists, although Russia's peacekeepers are supposed to be in a neutral role. Georgia also accuses Russia of double standards in brutally suppressing its own separatist rebellion in Chechnya while encouraging separatists in Georgia. </p> <h2>What does Russia want?</h2> <p>In the short term, Russia has made no secret of its desire for \"regime change\". Moscow wants a more pliant leader in Tblisi than the US-educated Mikhail Saaskhasvili, America's staunchest ally in the region, who is determined to take Georgia into Nato. He also came into office pledging to reassert control over Georgia's breakaway provinces. More generally, Russia is sending a signal to its neighbours \u2013 which include Ukraine \u2013 that they are still within the Russian sphere of influence, and that there are clear limits to their rapprochement with the west. The line in the sand for Russia is that it does not want Nato in its back yard. Russia has been equally vociferous in resisting the stationing of parts of a US missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p> <h2>What are the wider implications?</h2> <p>The short war has highlighted US impotence in the region, despite its strong verbal support for Georgia. The EU -and particularly the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy - has taken the diplomatic lead, leaving the Americans on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Russia has forcefully made the point that it is not to be trifled with in its own backyard.

Only about 40% full, though.</p> <p><strong>The theme:</strong> Fifteen minutes of standup, a few \"special\" guests promoting their Fringe shows, followed by a Bullseye-style game. \"We're not allowed to do the official version of Bullseye, but it's a gentle imitation,\" Bowen explains, before proceeding to supervise a darts-based gameshow with absolutely no differences whatsoever from the ITV original.</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> He's probably been telling them for 40 years, but Bowen's mildewed gags still haven't lost all their charm. \"My mother was a good sport,\" he explains at the outset, \"and my father was the crew of the Ark Royal.\" Ba-doosh! Well I laughed, anyway, and so did all the silver-haired groupies in the front row. It is much too easy to mock this old style of comedy and overlook the genuine ingenuity and skill that it still involves - neither of which are exactly universal in contemporary standup. Besides, the foibles of Yorkshiremen and mothers-in-law now feel positively fresh compared with jokes about Madeleine McCann and Josef Fritzl.</p> <p><strong>Weak spot:</strong> Bowen is the first to admit that he finds himself politically out of step with modern Britain. His frustrations with \"the PC brigade\" take barely two minutes to bubble up, and never quite subside for the rest of the show. The black comedian Charlie Williams, he tells us, used to threaten to move in next door to any audience members who didn't like his act. \"You can't tell that now,\" Bowen complains. \"It's bloody racist.\" But you just told it, Jim. You've been telling it every day for years, and no one seems to mind. But then, why would they? Virtually every black comedian in Britain still tells jokes like that. \"Les Dawson had a wonderful face,\" Bowen continues. \"It had been lived in, hadn't it? By bloody Gippos.\" OK\u2026 um\u2026 yes, well, I think that one might be racist, actually.</p> <p><strong>Audience participation:</strong> Nodding meekly, reciting rhymes, and saying \"yes\" when Bowen asks if we remember something very old.</p> <p><strong>Comic equation:</strong> (Bernard Manning/Frank Carson) x Eric Bristow</p> <p><strong>Mark out of 10:</strong> 5</p> <p><strong>Put this on your poster:</strong> Not to be confused with the television programme Bullseye.

  "<p>President Bush, who hasn't pardoned many criminals in his time, will have a chance to spare legions before leaving office in January.</p> <p>Requests for presidential pardons and commutations of prison sentences are piling up at the justice department, with more than 3,000 pending. And, if history serves as any guide, the height of pardon season arrives in the final December of any president's term.</p> <p>Bush has proven to be exceptionally sparing with his pardon power. In modern times, only his father offered less clemency for the convicted. President George HW Bush, with only one term in which to act, signed just 74 pardons and 3 commutations - a fraction of what many recent presidents have allowed.</p> <p>Near the end of his second term, the younger Bush has signed just 157 pardons and six commutations. He has drawn widespread attention for only one: the commutation of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby's prison time after the former chief of staff for vice-president Dick Cheney was convicted of obstruction of justice.</p> <p>But Bush will have plenty of opportunities before leaving office in January. Nearly 1,000 petitions for pardons and more than 2,000 bids for commutations of sentences are pending.</p> <p>Marion Jones, the world-champion sprinter serving six months in jail for lying about her use of performance-enhancing drugs, is among those seeking clemency.</p> <p>So is Michael Milken, the junk-bond financier who went to prison for insider trading and is free now but seeking a pardon. President Bill Clinton turned him down.</p> <p>Former Democratic governor Edwin Edwards of Louisiana, serving a 10-year prison sentence for racketeering, is seeking a commutation of his sentence. So are former Republican congressman Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham of California, sentenced to eight years for conspiracy to commit bribery, wire fraud and tax evasion, and John Walker Lindh, the American who served the Taliban and was captured during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, serving a 20-year prison term.</p> <p>But this president's pardons have tended toward lower-profile wrong-doers.</p> <p>PS Ruckman Jr, a professor of political science at Rock Valley College in Rockford, Illinois, and an expert on executive clemency, said: \"If you're a betting person, and you look at the numbers and the fact that most pardons have landed in December, I think there is every reason to expect there are some pardons ahead.\"</p> <p>The president, who moved cautiously on clemency from the start, arrived in the White House in the wake of a pardon scandal. Clinton, on his final day in office, handed out 141 pardons, including one for fugitive financier Marc Rich, a commodities trader who had fled to Switzerland facing charges of evading $48m in federal income taxes and trading oil with Iran in violation of US sanctions.</p> <p>\"Should I decide to grant pardons,\" Bush declared in February 2001, \"I will do so in a fair way. I will have the highest of standards\".</p> <p>It was two years before Bush issued any. And like most who have benefited from Bush's clemency, they were known to few but their neighbours - people convicted of gambling, transporting a machine gun or stolen car, fraud in loan applications, embezzlement and several convicted of trafficking in cocaine or marijuana.</p> <p>The president has the power to pardon people convicted of federal crimes or shorten or erase prison sentences. Clemency is generally not a declaration of innocence, the justice department says, but rather an act of mercy. It may involve clearing the name of someone who cannot find employment because of a conviction.</p> <p>The proliferation of minimum mandatory sentences in the federal courts, particularly in drug convictions, has led to fast-growing numbers of bids for executive clemency in the past two decades, experts say.</p> <p>Most of Florida's congressional delegation is seeking a posthumous pardon for Charles Winters, who provided aircraft for Israelis in the 1948 war of independence and was convicted under the US Neutrality Act and served prison time. The Floridian died in 1984, and his son and the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County have filed a petition for a pardon. The justice department says it is considering the eligibility of the request.</p> <p>Jones, the sprinter, is seeking a pardon. The chief executive of USA Track and Field is opposing it, with Doug Logan writing to Bush: \"Our country has long turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of our heroes.\"</p> <p>In modern times, president Gerald Ford's pardon of his predecessor, president Richard Nixon, who resigned in the midst of the Watergate scandal in 1974, stands out as the most memorable. \"This is an American tragedy,\" Ford said then. \"But it is not the ultimate fate of Richard Nixon that most concerns me. My concern is the immediate future of this great country.\" He declared the nation's \"long nightmare\" over.</p> <p>But during Ford's short time in the White House, according to the justice department, he granted 382 pardons and 22 commutations. Jimmy Carter, in one term: 534 pardons, 29 commutations. Ronald Reagan, in two terms: 393 pardons and 13 commutations. Bill Clinton, in two terms: 396 pardons, 61 commutations.</p> <p>Through July, the justice department has collected 1,936 petitions for pardons since the start of Bush's first term, and 7,330 bids for commutation and had about another 2,000 requests pending that were left from the Clinton White House. While granting the 157 pardons and six commutations, the president has denied requests for 1,429 pardons and 5,683 commutations.</p> <p>The figures underscore the rarity of Libby's clemency, his 30-month prison sentence forgiven after conviction for lying to federal authorities in the probe of who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame.</p> <p>\"I respect the jury's verdict,\" Bush said in July 2007. \"But I have concluded that the prison sentence given to Mr Libby is excessive.\"<br>Critics of the White House suggest that Libby still could be in line for a full pardon near the end of Bush's term. But the justice department says there is no pending request for a Libby pardon.</p> <p>Bush \"has been very cautious, done very little that would get him into any trouble\" on pardons, said Margaret Love, a Washington attorney who represents people seeking clemency and who served as the pardon attorney at the justice department from 1990 to 1997, under the former presidents Bush and Clinton. Bush has pardoned people \"you've never heard of ... Only their hometown neighbours would know who they are.\"</p> <p>The Office of the Pardon Attorney has just six attorneys and a support staff to consider all the pardon and commutation requests.</p> <p>\"Although it has a challenging workload,\" justice department spokesman Erik Ablin says, it is committed \"to giving each clemency petition ... careful review ... As the historical figures demonstrate, a commutation of sentence is an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted\".</p> <p>If Bush's father was just as sparing with the power of clemency, Love said, it had more to do with his justice department recommending relatively few for consideration. With fewer than 1,500 petitions received during the father's term, he granted just 77, denied more than 1,000 and closed more than 500 without action.</p> <p>\"He cannot be faulted for a parsimonious pardoning record, because there were not as many applications then,\" Love said of her former employer. \"And he did not get that many favourable recommendations from the justice department. He granted all of the pardons that were recommended to him by the justice department.\"</p> <p>The current president's justice department won't say if all of its recommendations for clemency have been approved by Bush. But Bush, like presidents before him, has proven most forgiving in December. Nearly half of his acts of clemency came during December, by Ruckman's count.</p> <p>\"There is a tidal wave of petitions coming in,\" Love said, and despite the fact that pardons generally are granted throughout a president's time in office, \"everybody seems to expect that the president is going to do a lot at the end of his term\".</p>",
  "<p>Police investigating the murders of two Chinese graduates in Newcastle have discovered a drowned cat in their bathroom.</p> <p>The bodies of Xi Zhou and her boyfriend, Zhen Xing Yang, both 25, were found in their flat in Newcastle's West End on Saturday. They had suffered severe head injuries caused by a knife and another sharp weapon.</p> <p>A motive has yet to be established for the killing of the Chinese nationals, who were both described by academic staff as friendly and very hard-working.</p> <p>Police were today trying to establish if the cat's death was linked to the attack on its owners.</p> <p>The black and white pet was found submerged in a washing bowl under the sink covered with a towel and kitchen gloves. It was taken from the flat by police for a post-mortem examination.</p> <p>\"Officers are keeping an open mind as to the significance of this find,\" said Detective Superintendent Steve Wade, who is leading the inquiry.</p> <p>\"However, one possibility being considered is that the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders.\"</p> <p>Detectives said they would speak to experts in Chinese culture to explore any significance in a murder victim's pet also being killed.</p> <p>Forensic scientists continued to check the ground floor flat for any sign of forced entry. One theory was that the couple, who met at Newcastle University and graduated two years ago with good degrees, might have known their attacker and let them in.</p> <p>\"It was a vicious attack, there was a lot of blood and I think in any interpretation that was something frenzied,\" said Wade.</p> <p>\"We will work around the clock to catch those responsible. We have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case, we have the support of the local community, the area command policing and the people of Newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime.\"</p> <p>Wade told a news conference Yang suffered extensive bruising to both forearms before he was killed, perhaps up to an hour prior to the fatal attack. He said the injuries were likely to have been inflicted as Yang tried to protect his head.</p> <p>\"He has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault, which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm.\"</p> <p>Police said they had checked the dead couple's bank accounts and found no reason for such a violent attack. They reviewed airport and port passenger lists for suspicious movements since Zhou was last seen on Thursday and ruled out any links to Triad gangs or drugs.</p> <p>\"At this stage we have no motive as to why these two people have been killed which could be properly put forward as a reason why they should be attacked with such brutality,'' Wade said.</p> <p>\"Sometimes the police hold news conferences like this and go through the motions with the media when they already have it in the bag, but this really is an undetected homicide.</p> <p>\"We are beginning to make inroads into their friends and associates, but we are a long way short of establishing a motive for this crime, and we are a long way short of arresting anyone.\"</p> <p>Wade said an offender profiler would be brought in to help the investigation. \"He will take a look at the sequence of events and give us some assistance into what happened.\"</p> <p>Relatives of Zhou, who was a popular member of staff at the local Wagamama restaurant, were traced to Hunan in southern China with the help of friends in Britain. She finished her MA in applied linguistics in September 2006 - the same time Yang took an MA in international human resources. They had valid visas until the end of this year.</p> <p>Police spoke to the family of Yang, who was also known as Kevin, over the phone in Dalian City, China.</p> <p>Wade appealed to Newcastle's Chinese community to come forward with potential reasons for the attack.</p> <p>Pastor Eddy Tang of the city's International Christian Fellowship, who is helping police liaise with members of the north-east's 10,000-strong Chinese student community, said: \"People are very subdued at the moment. They are in mourning.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Los Angeles.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Michael Vidal (guitar, vocals), Juan Valasquez (vocals, guitar), Reggie Guerrero (bass), Dave Reichardt (drums).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Abe Vigoda, named after the veteran Hollywood actor who portrayed mobster Sal Tessio in The Godfather, won't put a horse's head in your bed, but they are making a racket you wouldn't be able to refuse even if you took the cotton wool out of Marlon Brando's mouth and wedged it in your ears.</p> <p>They're the latest American exponents of lush, tropical punk, of gamelan grunge, of Afrobeat noisepop, and there will be a lot of fuss made about them this autumn in the press. They're harder and more aggressive in sound than Vampire Weekend but the intent is similar: to mix up the rhythms and melodies of highlife with rock's energy and urge to overkill. Their forthcoming album Skeletons - not their first, but the first to gain them worldwide exposure - is a relentless affair, like being attacked by a steel band playing Stooges songs at double speed. But blink and you'll miss them. There are 14 tracks on Skeletons, the longest at 3 minutes 42 seconds, the shortest, Whatever Forever, comprising 44 seconds of amplified static and interference, like hearing My Bloody Valentine and kid606 having a barney in a blizzard. Most of the songs come in at the one or two-minute mark, but they cram so much into each one, there are so many jerky snippets and snatches, tempo twitches and changes of pace, it takes several plays to take in what's going on. <br> Yesterday's NBOTD name-checked Orange Juice, citing them as the godfathers of jingly-jangly indie, which they sort-of were. Abe Vigoda are truer to the Scottish band's original determination to be a white rock band playing African rhythms - that they got it so wrong but somehow so right, was one of those happy accidents. In fact, Abe Vigoda's song Lantern Heights recalls those other early-80s pioneers of scratchy Scottish funk, the Fire Engines. Before they decided to sound like Pavement wrestling with King Sunny Ade or a post-rock band doing disgraceful things to Paul Simon's Graceland, Abe Vigoda were high-school dance-punks with a penchant for no wave and new wave, making few waves with old ideas and tired strategies. Then they became involved in the unappetisingly titled The Smell, an all-ages arts/performance space in downtown LA where experimental bands with names like No Age, Magik Markers, Old Time Relijun, Health and Mika Miko do avant-garde things with a DIY attitude. Abe Vigoda look set to be the first band from that scene to attract global interest with their mad splashy drums, intricate spurts of micro-percussion, lilting vocals crooning vaguely about Hyacinth Grrls, Cranes and Visi Rings and against-all-odds cohesive pulling together of a myriad disparate elements.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The chaotic hurtle of noise-rock with the incandescent chime of highlife.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's intriguing, it can be annoying, but when it works, and in small doses - too much is just too much - Abe Vigoda make an exhilarating noise.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Lubricate your living room. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Pay to have Vampire Weekend, ahem, \"removed\".<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut album Skeleton is released by Bella Union on October 6. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Vampire Weekend, Pavement, 23 Skidoo, Fire Engines. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"www.myspace.com/abevigoda\">MySpace.com/abevigoda</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Anni Rossi.</p>",
  "<p>There must be rude people in China, and there must be grumpy people too, but I haven't met any in Beijing, and I've been here a week now. It's been a gruelling city to explore, as is any foreign metropolis. Beijing, though, seems especially difficult to navigate on foot, which is the best way to see any city. The arterial routes, ring roads and all, are too vast to wonder, all six lanes wide, and the side streets in-between too labyrinthine to do much other than get lost in.</p> <p>At first it felt like I was in a pinball table, replete with neon lights and steel and concrete buffers. I was bouncing around, zinging to and fro in taxis, listening to the radios' tiny delivery of either the state music or talk channels.</p> <p>And I loved it. In all my blundering, I've never shrugged the smile off my face. It's the people who live here that make it a great city, especially as the Olympics have brought out their best. Even in the most barren corners of town, and I've stumbled into a few construction sites and dead-end dumps, the passersby will smile, nod and stop to share the briefest of conversations.</p> <p>They have to be brief. The month or so of Mandarin studying I did before I came here has borne strange fruit. My teacher was the <a href=\"http://www.rosettastone.com/\">Rosetta Stone</a> (yes, I promised I'd give them a plug), a computer programme that is perfect if you want to try to master a language, but almost useless if you are slightly lazy and just in need of a few basic essentials. Other than the obvious everyday phrases, my Mandarin Chinese vocabulary is confined to such curious lines as \"no, I am not a doctor\", \"the horse is running\" and \"the fish is green\".</p> <p>I have the ability to make mundane but grammatically immaculate observations which either make me appear to be a gnomic idiot-savant or just a plain idiot. Probably the latter. I actually got to use the fish line at the Forbidden City today, staring into a pool of carp in the Imperial Gardens. And, just like every other encounter I've had here, the stranger smiled and laughed, asked where I was from and if I was here for the Games.</p> <p>There have been times when I've caught myself in situations so stupid only a wet-behind-the ears tourist could create them, such as when I asked a driver to take me to the drum tower (Gulou) and we spent 30 minutes driving in a square around the four Gulou expressways that surround the place I thought was our destination, the driver despairing at the fact I couldn't understand what I'd told him to do was the equivalent of circling the Wandsworth gyratory system. And in his frustration, his response - like everybody else's here - was to laugh at the comedy of it. I might be wrong, but I find it hard to imagine your average London cabbie would be as tolerant of a visiting tourist.</p> <p>Having finally conceded that going solo around Beijing wasn't working out, I hired an old gent to act as a guide around the Hutongs near Houhai Lake. I couldn't understand a word he said, but he seemed especially keen to point out the public WC system as we went. He spoke, I nodded, and we both laughed, neither of us really knowing why or what at.</p> <p>The smiles and conversations compensate for the unforgiving environment: the traffic constant, the clouds indistinguishable from the smog, most of the architecture bleakly modern. The citizens of Beijing seem to have found a way of coping with the habitat their government has created for them. That way seems to have a lot to do with laughter. An argument tends to last only as long as the moment in which it happens, forgotten as soon as it is over.</p> <p>Perversely for a culture that can be so colourful, vast swathes of the city are painted in uniform hues. The mazes of Hutong streets are gun-metal grey, just as the palaces and walls of the Forbidden City are deep terracotta. It is the people's personal decoration that provides the charm: the lanterns hung in the windows, the flags and plants that clutter the doorways.</p> <p>From what I've seen there is a definite coldness to the authorities' shepherding of the public at these Games, as stark as the steel fences that encircle the venues for hundreds of metres in all directions. The thousands of people thronging the streets to watch the fireworks of the opening ceremony were bluntly held back by lines of stony-faced policemen. It was frustrating, even for journalists. I bluffed my way to within a kilometre or so of the Bird's Nest using my pass, but could get no closer.</p> <p>Amazingly though, wherever the crowd was rebuffed, it would change flow and find another way along a path of lesser resistance to gain an extra few yards of proximity. I watched exhilarated as hundreds of people broke from the mass, sprinted across a huge highway and, despite the protests of officials, scaled the four-foot barrier between lanes and moved on over the road.</p> <p>It is the public on the streets who do most to make a stranger feel welcome, the officials here are all about no-smoking zones, security checks and no access. For all the billions of dollars, brilliant stadiums and absorbing sport, these Games would be rotten if the Beijing public weren't what they are: friendly and welcoming, tolerant but spirited.</p>",
  "<h2>What are the UK drugs laws?</h2> <p>There are two main laws regulating the availability of drugs in the UK: the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Medicines Act. The latter governs the manufacture and supply of medicines and mainly affects doctors and pharmacists. The former controls not just medicinal drugs but also drugs with no current medical uses, and offences under this act mainly involve the general public. The drugs covered by this act are known as controlled drugs. The law covers a range of offences, including unlawful supply, intent to supply, import or export, and unlawful production. The police have powers to stop, detain and search people on \"reasonable suspicion\" that they are in possession of a controlled drug.</p> <h2>What are the drug classifications?</h2> <p>The Misuse of Drugs Act divides drugs into three classes: A, B and C. Class A drugs are treated by the law as the most dangerous, and class C as the least harmful.</p> <h2>Which drugs are class A?</h2> <p>Class A drugs include heroin, crack, cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, methadone, metamphetamine (crystal meth), magic mushrooms containing the hallucinogenic chemicals psilocin, and any Class B drug that is injected.</p> <h2>What are the risks and effects associated with these drugs?</h2> <p>Most heroin users initially experience a sleepy, pleasant euphoria, which leads to a feeling of calm and relaxation. As the body gets used to these effects, users experience fewer and eventually no pleasurable feelings. Withdrawal is extremely unpleasant, and it can cost users up to \u00a3100 per day to feed their addiction, which leads some into crime and prostitution. The biggest danger of heroin addiction comes from sharing dirty needles, which puts users at risk of contracting diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, septicaemia, gangrene and pneumonia.</p> <p>Cocaine and crack are strong but short-lasting stimulants. Users experience an intense high lasting around 30 minutes with cocaine, or 20 minutes with crack. The after-effects may include fatigue and depression. Cocaine and crack are not physically addictive like heroin, but chronic users get used to the drug keeping them awake and functional. Physical side-effects include a dry mouth, sweating, loss of appetite and increased heart and pulse rate. Smoking crack regularly can cause chest pain, lung damage and bronchitis. Excessive doses can cause heart attacks and death, but this is rare. Crack use also induces mood swings, which can bring on paranoia and depression. High doses can result in psychosis and aggression.</p> <h2>Which drugs are class B?</h2> <p>These include amphetamines, barbiturates and codeine. Amphetamines are stimulants; users tend to feel more alert, energetic, confident and cheerful and less bored or tired. Physical effects include quicker breathing and heart rate, loss of appetite and widened pupils. After several hours, users may become anxious, irritable and restless. During the comedown, users can feel tired, weak and unwell. Excessive use, especially over a few days, can induce depression, paranoia and even hallucinations.</p> <p>Barbiturates are sedatives, and a small dose makes people feel relaxed, sociable and good humoured. Larger doses commonly produce hostility and anxiety, as well as slurred speech, loss of coordination, and sleepiness \u2013 making users more prone to accidents. There is a high risk of overdose because the lethal dose is close to the \"normal\" dose level - 10 tablets may be fatal. Regular use leads to tolerance and physical dependence. Heavy users are at risk of bronchitis, pneumonia and hypothermia.</p> <h2>Which drugs are class C?</h2> <p>These include cannabis, mild amphetamines, anabolic steroids and minor tranquilisers. Cannabis has a mild sedative effect and generally makes people relax. Users may become giggly and talkative or, depending on their mood, quieter and subdued. Many people report that they become more aware of music and colours and that time seems to stand still. The physical effects of smoking cannabis include faster pulse rate, decreased blood pressure, bloodshot eyes, increased appetite and occasional dizziness. Excessive use can make people apathetic, lack energy and motivation and perform poorly at work. Skunk, a more potent form of cannabis, has been linked to mental health disorders. However, it is not clear whether the psychotic symptoms are short-term or persist after use of the drug has ceased.</p> <h2>What are the penalties for the possession and supply of these drugs?</h2> <p>The maximum penalty for possession of class A drugs is seven years in jail and a fine. The maximum penalty for supplying this class of drug is life imprisonment plus a fine. The maximum penalty for possessing class B drugs is five years and a fine, while supplying them can draw a jail term of up to 14 years and a fine. The maximum penalty for possession of class C drugs is two years in jail and a fine, and for supply 14 years and a fine.</p> <h2>What is the current state of play with the cannabis laws?</h2> <p>In 2007, Gordon Brown asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to carry out a review after concerns were raised about the stronger cannabis strain known as skunk, and whether it had a connection to mental illness. The council found there should be a wait of two more years for further scientific evidence of a link. But this was overruled by the government, with the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, saying there was a compelling case to act now.</p> <p>Cannabis is to be reclassified as a class B drug from early next year, less than five years after it was downgraded to a class C drug. It was downgraded to a class C drug in 2004 when David Blunkett, the then home secretary, decided it was important for police to focus on drugs such as cocaine and heroin.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a> has given the go-ahead to a \u00a350m development project in a London borough led by a political ally, despite a warning from his own planning officers that it will fail to help meet the housing needs of some of the poorest local residents. </p> <p>The scheme, which will bring new housing and a health and social care centre to the White City area of west London, originally provided for 50% of its accommodation units to be \"affordable\" - half for private purchase at \"intermediate\" prices and half for \"social rent\" by the least well-off. </p> <p>A revised application from the developer considered by the planning applications committee of Conservative-controlled Hammersmith and Fulham council last month, following Johnson's election as mayor in May, contained only 39% \"affordable\" accommodation, of which none was for rent. </p> <p>The committee approved the latest plan despite a report from Johnson's planning department concluding that the absence of social rented provision represented \"a disproportionate approach.\" </p> <p>Mayor Johnson, who has pledged to provide 50,000 new affordable homes by 2011, has powers to intervene. But one of his deputies, Ian Clement, to whom the mayor has temporarily delegated his planning powers, has informed the council by letter that he will not do so. </p> <p>The development, on Bloemfontein Road in Shepherd's Bush, was first proposed when Hammersmith and Fulham was in Labour hands. The developer, Building Better Health, which specialises in partnerships with the public sector, resubmitted its plan with reduced social rented provision in December 2007. By then the Conservatives had won control of the borough under the leadership of Stephen Greenhalgh. </p> <p>The third, social rental-free, version was presented to the council in June, the month after Johnson had appointed Greenhalgh to his forensic audit panel. However, Mark Loveday, Hammersmith and Fulham's cabinet member for strategy, firmly refuted \"any suggestion that a political deal has been done. It just wasn't like that at all.\"</p> <p>The mayor's decision highlights the differences in approach between Johnson and his predecessor, Ken Livingstone. A spokesperson for Johnson said that, being in an area with an already \"very high proportion of existing social rented housing\", the application met \"an acute need for intermediate housing and wider regeneration\". </p> <p>But Labour politicians have been quick to interpret the mayor's decision as contradicting his claim that his target for affordable homes in the capital will be best met by \"working with the boroughs\" rather than imposing quotas on them from the centre, as Livingstone had done. </p> <p>Livingstone had also \"named and shamed\" Hammersmith and Fulham as a council that was failing to build its fair share of social housing. </p> <p>Andy Slaughter, the Labour MP for Shepherd's Bush, claimed there is a council waiting list of 8,000 and widespread overcrowding, and that social rented housing represents the \"only opportunity\" the borough's many low income households have \"to find decent homes\".</p> <p>Nicky Gavron, Labour's spokesperson on housing and planning on the assembly, said the council's decision to remove the social rented component \"looks like a conscious political decision\" and that allowing Hammersmith and Fulham to have its way contradicted Johnson's assurance that his planning powers would be used to block developments that weren't of benefit to Londoners. </p> <p>But Loveday insisted that his borough's approach to \"the problems of monotenure estates\" was in keeping both with government guidance and the 2006 Hills report into social housing and was was being adopted by boroughs across London \"including Labour ones\". </p> <p>And in a statement, Greenhalgh applauded the mayor's stance, saying it marked \"a landmark shift away from the dogma of percentages and towards delivering the homes and community facilities that individual neighbourhoods really need\". </p> <p>Greenhalgh said: \"This scheme will provide White City residents with a badly-needed foot on the home ownership ladder and produce a more mixed and balanced community. </p> <p>\"A census of all council tenants in 2007 identified that 72% of people living in council housing would like to own their own homes if they could afford it. This development helps make their aspirations a reality by providing 70 homes for low-cost sale.\"</p>",

  "<p>Difficult market conditions could continue into 2011, Terry Smith warned yesterday as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/collinsstewart\">Collins Stewart</a>, the stockbroking firm he chairs, reported an 80% drop in first-half profits.</p> <p>The firm, which is in takeover talks with an unnamed suitor, is experiencing a slowdown in its capital markets division which slumped to a loss of \u00a310.5m, compared with a \u00a316m profit a year ago.</p> <p>The division is languishing as companies shy away from raising fresh funds from investors whose appetite for new risk is being hampered by the credit crunch.</p> <p>\"My personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011. These are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen,\" said Smith, who is also chief executive of acquisition-hungry money broker Tullett Prebon.</p> <p>The loss in the capital markets arm knocked group operating profits to \u00a37.1m, down from \u00a340.5m a year ago, even though its Hawkpoint advisory business and wealth management operations reported a rise in earnings. The fourth division - the securities arm which provides research on 300 large and small cap stocks in the UK - experienced a fall in profits but \"performed well\" in the light of market conditions.</p> <p>Chief executive Joel Plasco has ambitions to expand in the credit crunch and win business from mid-sized companies.

  "<p>Everyone loves a good read, but when you start believing that Dragon's Den might just take a chance on your waterproof paperback shower shield, you know your appetites are getting out of control. Reading addiction is not the same as loving books; it's more like book abuse, and it's time we afflicted stopped hiding from the truth.</p> <p>A healthy bibliophile reads their texts carefully; an addict devours them, regardless quality. A lit junkie still thirsts after the best writing, but if necessary they won't hesitate to use Dan Brown to calm the craving, despite knowing <a href=\"http://www.deadbrain.co.uk/news/article_2006_05_31_3008.php\">how dirty they'll feel in the morning</a>. </p> <p>Like all compulsive habits, reading addiction stems from the need to escape and control. I need a book in my face like others need a fag in their fingers: it acts as a barrier between me and the world, and heightens, comforts or calms my emotions depending on my need.</p> <p>For those with greyhoundish levels of energy, a book provides a constant channel and focus for the brain; the need to lend your own imagination to the tale makes it far more effective than TV. And with a trusty paper prop, solitude loses its sting; dining alone without a book shouts saddo-no-friends stigma, but put a Penguin 60 in your hand and you're transformed into liberated enigma.</p> <p>If you have a book, you have a purpose and a shield. This is fine to an extent, but usually belittling to the books you're escaping into. When I'm abusing a book, I lapse into a kind of ravenous trance, reading too fast, remembering too little. When you can study a book review from start to finish without realising you've already read the novel in question, you can be pretty sure you've been perpetrating abuse.</p> <p>Reading addiction is so dangerous because it's not only sanctioned but positively encouraged by society. My childhood self, prone to spending social occasions in a corner with a book, was indulged - particularly after my parents discovered reading pacified their tantrummy brat as effectively as any dummy. In any case, voracious reading in a kid is seen as a sign of intellect. Of course, the older you get, the less this applies; the plea that \"adults are boring\" definitely sounds emotionally retarded when you're 25. On a recent night out in Bungalow 8, I found myself swapping my vintage snakeskin clutch bag for an old M&amp;S sack so I could smuggle in my 800-page copy of Underworld, just in case I got bored. (I did. But stupidly, I forgot the torch.)</p> <p>Now that I'm aware of my illness, I'm seeing it everywhere. The shamefaced woman white-knuckling a grubby Grisham at the bus stop. The thick-specc'd bloke in the opticians scraping the barrel with The Shoe People's Village Fete.</p> <p>Enough. I propose that fellow addicts join me in applying the principles of Carlo Petrini's <a href=\"http://www.slowfood.com/\">slow food movement</a> to the rehabilitation of their reading. We must pledge to focus on the quality of the attention we give to our books, not the quantity thoughtlessly consumed. We should remind ourselves that reading time should be sacred, set aside for when we're focused, alert and relaxed. For when our minds are ready to be engaged, not just abandoned. Not just when we can't bear to face the world. And definitely not when we're drunk.</p>",
  "<p><br>The Stalingrad memorial ... an attempt to lend apocalyptic madness the nobility of a Greek temple frieze. Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/AP</p> <p>The strangest work of art I have ever seen occupies a hillside outside Volgograd - the Russian city once called <a href=\"http://users.pandora.be/stalingrad/\">Stalingrad</a>. It is the <a href=\"http://mamayevhill.volgadmin.ru/00_n.htm\">Stalingrad battle memorial</a>. Beneath a gigantic statue, relief carvings of street fighters with machine guns and grenades try to give the apocalyptic madness of what happened here in the 1940s the nobility of a Greek temple frieze.</p> <p>When I saw it, immediately after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/13/comment.russia\">Soviet Union's downfall</a>, this work of art seemed remote, a trace of a century coming to an end. Now, history folds back on itself. The world of the 1930s and 40s comes ever closer to us. We're living in a horror film: the dead of Stalingrad, Warsaw and Dresden summon us.</p> <p>For anyone who has ever read a book about 20th-century history or studied it at school, Russia's attack on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a> - apparently premeditated, longed for, waiting to roll as soon as there was a casus belli - is terrifying, for it is so disturbingly resonant of the degeneration of international order in the 1930s.</p> <p>Alarm bells really must sound for the world now - history is plainly repeating itself. The fragile bonds of reason that keep states and societies negotiating have dissolved. It's all very well to spin apocalyptic scenarios about \"Islamic fascism\", but terrorists are ultimately not in a position to achieve anything like fascism for the simple reason they do not control a state. When states start acting like terrorists - that's when the nightmare of mid-20th century Europe is reborn. And that's what's happening. The Stalingrad memorial beckons. Have a nice August.</p>",

  "<p>Richard Faulds is one of those Olympians who has to work especially hard for his moments of glory. His blessing is to be among the finest exponents of his chosen discipline in the world, his curse that it is one that will never shoehorn its way into the public imagination.</p> <p>Shooting is one of the oddities of the Olympic programme. It was one of the original sports selected by de Coubertin in 1896 when in the trap (clay pigeon) they events they used real pigeons. As primarily a test of skill rather than raw physicality these days it is consigned to the margins by sports that more obviously capture the essence of fitter, higher, stronger. Double-trap shooting meanwhile, the discipline in which Faulds excels, is a niche event within a niche sport.</p> <p>Shooting faces a further obvious barrier to its aim of attracting more kids to the range. In these troubled times it is not the most politically correct way of keeping the kids off the streets, and one waits with interest to see exactly how the 2012 Games organisers intend to leave a legacy for this sport in east London.</p> <p>These barriers to recognition and popularity are of course irrelevant to Faulds and his fellow Olympians, though he has done more than any Briton to raise the profile of his sport by winning gold in the Sydney Games.</p> <p>After failing to reach the final in Athens, the only time he has missed out in four Games, today he attempted to add another medal to his collection at the Beijing shooting range on the northern outskirts of the city. It was not to be as he finished last of six behind a dead-eyed American called Walton Eller, but parochial interest aside there was more than enough Olympic spirit on display to make it worth the half-hour ride from the city.</p> <p>As with every other venue the organisers have done all they can to beautify the place. Facing a wooded hillside reverberating with the chirp of a million cicadas, the range is flanked by little castellated towers from between which a rotating turret fires the livid pink traps the marksmen are required to nail. A decent crowd looked on from the sizeable grandstand, and in between rounds murmured their approval at the performance of local boy Hu Binyuan, who was to finish third.</p> <p>The murmuring got louder as the final progressed, not least because after 20 minutes of action the ringing in you ears makes it harder to make out the person next to you. This is not a sport that the hungover should contemplate attending.</p> <p>The shooters each have 25 pairs of traps to shoot, with a point for each on they hit. Even winged targets count, and the standard is so high that missing seven traps was sufficient to leave Faulds last, and just four more would have got him a bronze medal.</p> <p>With two traps flying randomly away from the guns, rhythm and nerve appear to be the keys to success and, according to Fauld's coach Ian Coley, the former deserted his man today. \"Richard didn't shoot his best today and he will know that, because that was a bad final. He lost his timing, and when that happens you try to shoot them, and when you are chasing them you are in trouble.\"</p> <p>Faulds said he had not decided yet whether to press on with a training schedule that sees him shoot up to 1,000 traps a week, in order to make the 2012 Olympics. \"I have been to four Olympic Games, reached the final in three and have one gold medal. London is a long way off and I want to think about it first.\"</p> <p>If he needs persuading to carry on he might have found inspiration in the reaction of Francesco Daniello, an Italian with a passing resemblance to Constantino Rocca, to the silver medal he snatched at the last. As the medal was confirmed he dropped to his knees, waved his shotgun above his head for a moment before beating the turf while sobbing uncontrollably.</p> <p>He was quickly joined by two compatriots clutching flags, and the three of them wept for the cameras before Francesco mounted the press benches, gun still in hand. The thought occurred that he was in search of any Italian journalists who might have been unwise enough to write off his chances in their morning previews.</p> <p>Happily he was heading for the man from Italian radio, and they talked so long that the medal ceremony was delayed, much to the annoyance of officials more interested in protocol than the man who won it. They entirely missed the point of the moment, but you can be sure Faulds did not.</p>",
  "<p>Next April sees the demise of the Healthcare Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) and the Mental Health Act Commission (MHAC) \u2013 three inspectorates that have earned respect from patients and service users for their robust independence from government.</p> <p>The Healthcare Commission, for example, provided the public with hard evidence about which NHS trusts gave an excellent service and which fell below an acceptable standard. Its report last year on the Clostridium difficile outbreaks at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals gave massive impetus to efforts to improve hygiene control across the NHS.</p> <p>But those three bodies will make way for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), chaired by Barbara Young. </p> <p>She was made a life peer in 1997 and took the Labour whip in the Lords until 2000, when she abandoned party affiliation on becoming chief executive of the Environment Agency, the job she has left to chair the commission.</p> <p>The first question in the minds of health and social care inspectors is how independent can Young be when her political colours have been nailed to the mast for so long.</p> <p>Young says: \"Yes, I am a Labour luvvy. Nobody would regard me as anything other than a Labour party member, lifelong.</p> <p>\"On the other hand, I have done zillions of jobs in the public sector. I have hung my political hat at the door and got on with the job.\"</p> <p>She says her appointment as a Labour peer surprised Conservative frontbenchers with whom she worked during 18 years as a health service manager until 1991 and subsequently for 17 years in organisations defending nature and the environment.</p> <p>She recalls that Conservative ministers Kenneth Clarke and John Gummer approached her soon after her elevation to say: \"Nobody told us you were Labour.\"</p> <p>The secret of working effectively in high-level jobs in the public sector, she says, is knowing how to separate personal political allegiance from a professional obligation to work with anybody who can help deliver results.</p> <p>During the last general election, the Healthcare Commission published damning findings about the poor state of maternity services at Northwick Park hospital. Could Young be as careless of the government's reputation during the next election campaign?</p> <p>She says: \"If you were to ask any current Labour politician whether I was capable of biting their arm off if need be, you would only get one answer. My track record of being independent is there for all to see. And that is irrespective of government \u2013 Labour, Conservative, whatever. I get the job done well and I don't trim my sails.\"</p> <p>She said her style of operation at the CQC would be \"to talk softly and carry a big stick.\"</p> <p>For most of the time, an inspectorate should work with the service providers, cajoling them towards better compliance with standards. \"Once in a blue moon, you have to take tough action because people are not taking you seriously or because they have been given a chance and have not risen to the challenge.\"</p> <p>She saw enforcement of standards as \"an escalating process.\" The CQC's new powers to fine providers or, if necessary, shut down services would not be used regularly. It would not \"go around spraying out enforcement notices\".</p> <p>Such an adversarial style would not drive up quality, Young says, adding bluntly: \"If they do muck around, we will come down on them like a ton of bricks.\"</p> <p>She was talking in sparsely staffed offices on the south bank of the river Thames in London where the CQC is in a formative stage. Its chief executive, Cynthia Bower, a former NHS strategic health authority chief, came aboard a fortnight ago, but other senior posts have yet to be filled.</p> <p>It is too early for Young to give precise answers about the compliance criteria that the CQC will use to monitor the providers. But she says: \"We have to be at least as tough as the Healthcare Commission. We don't want to be a 'care failures commission' that spots the laggards and biffs them. We want to be about improving standards as well as [maintaining] minimum standards.\"</p> <p>The CQC would be looking for \"early wins\" to show the benefits of integrating health and social care inspection. She says people have no idea when they move between services that they are regulated in different ways. NHS, local authority and independent sector services need to be more joined up and a single regulator is better placed to oversee the joins, she claims.</p> <p>The Healthcare Commission has taken a \"big brain\" approach to regulation, using intelligence systems to identify risks in the NHS and target inspections accordingly. </p> <p>The CSCI approach was more about \"running the finger around the toilet bowl.\" It had thousands of care homes to regulate and fewer statistical tools to identify where problems might lie. So, inevitably, it relied more on regularly visiting establishments. But CSCI had been developing a more risk-based approach to inspections.</p> <p>Young says there is now a need for an overarching view across health and social care about what can be achieved from information systems and what needs on-the-ground inspection.</p> <p>Young says she has an assurance from the government that the CQC will start life with the combined budget of its three predecessor organisations. But ministers also want it to carry out extra work and the commission would have to set its own priorities.</p> <p>Although its headquarters are in London, there will be a regional structure, as yet undefined.</p> <p>Would there be redundancies? Young says: \"The process of bringing together three commissions inevitably means some folk will not get jobs. The vast majority of people on the ground will transfer to us and will, in the immediate future, do pretty much what they are doing at the moment, probably in the same place. We are doing this fast. Most organisations do not complete a merger in only eight months.</p> <p>\"Among senior teams, we don't anticipate people leaving because of financial constraints. But if you are the head of a particular division, you might not want to hang around and be second in line [in a merged inspectorate].\"</p> <p>She is concerned that good people at every level may be leaving the service because of the prospect of merger upheaval. Her decision to be interviewed by the Guardian was influenced by a need to tell them that it was worth pitching their lot in with the CQC.</p> <p>Young's message to staff was: \"Panic not. We are going to be big and ambitious. There will be lots to do. We are going to be the best regulator in the world of health and social care.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>Terence Rigby as Pozzo, with Richard Dormer as Lucky, in Peter Hall's 'near-definitive' production of Waiting for Godot. Photograph: Anna Arthur</p> <p>I had a small walk-on part in the life of the actor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/12/television.television\">Terence Rigby</a>, whose death, sadly, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/12/television.television1\">announced yesterday</a>. </p> <p>Back in the 1990s Rigby, who had built up a seductive practice in British theatre and television, suddenly decided to relocate to New York. But his initial application for the green card required by American Equity was turned down because he was too close to his referees: people like Peter Hall and John Gielgud. So, out of the blue, Rigby wrote to myself and Bernard Levin asking us to endorse his application. Whatever we said must have done the trick, since Rigby spent his last decade happily commuting between the US and the UK where the work offers still came in.</p> <p>Why did Rigby suddenly decide to go west? Meeting him five years ago, when he was rehearsing Pinter's Davies in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/aug/26/theatre\">The Caretaker for Bristol Old Vic</a>, I deduced it had a lot to do with his background. Rigby came from the Birmingham suburb of Erdington where his dad ran a two-man firm making hydraulic packings. I had a great-aunt who also came from Erdington and, from my childhood memories, it was a place you'd want to get out of. And you can see how a Brummagem boy, with a love of acting, would have entertained fantasies of the bright lights of Broadway.</p> <p>In reality, Broadway is a bit more like a grotty Birmingham suburb than we care to admit. And Rigby was honest enough to confess that his early years in New York were a struggle. He lived for a while in the apartment of a partying Puerto Rican family with a fire station underneath and a night-club next door. Eventually Rigby got his own tiny New York studio but, even when off-Broadway work came in, life was still tough: he told me that he earned a meagre $286 a week playing in <a href=\"http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&amp;tols_title=SMELLING%20A%20RAT%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=20020521&amp;byline=By%20BEN%20BRANTLEY&amp;id=1077011431472\">Mike Leigh's Smelling a Rat</a>. But Rigby was sustained by occasional movie work, the loyalty of old mates such as Hall and Pinter, and by his own immigrant version of the American dream.</p> <p>What Rigby's curious career conceals is that he had a vital quality as an actor: physical and emotional weight. It was this that enabled him to play the thuggish Briggs in Pinter's No Man's Land, Stalin in Robert Bolt's State of Revolution, and the bullying Pozzo in Peter Hall's most recent, and near-definitive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/26/theatre\">Waiting for Godot</a>. \"Weight\" is a hard quality to define: Timothy West has it, as did the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/24/guardianobituaries.filmnews\">Leo McKern</a>. But what is fascinating about Rigby is that he possessed it from the start, which is why he was a natural for TV cops in series like Z-Cars and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129717/\">Softly Softly</a>, and why he was so brilliant as the boxer, Joey, in Pinter's The Homecoming.</p> <p>I suspect that kind of weight is becoming increasingly rare for a simple reason: because of the abolition of mandatory student grants, fewer working or lower middle class actors can afford to go to drama school. What chance would a young Albert Finney, son of a Salford bookie, have today? Or indeed a young Rigby with his small-businessman background?</p> <p>Obviously there are a lot of good young actors about; but I know, from the begging letters I receive, that many are prevented from pursuing a theatrical career by lack of parental income. So we should celebrate Terence Rigby not only as a fine actor, but as an example of a fast-disappearing breed.</p>",
  "<p>The former US national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has called on the world community to isolate Russia in protest over its campaign in the Caucasus, likening its tactics to those of \"Hitler or Stalin\".</p> <p>Brzezinski, who was the national security adviser under President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981, and is now an occasional adviser to the Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, said the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, was \"following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by Stalin and Hitler in the 1930s\".</p> <p>He said that Putin's \"justification\" for splitting up Georgia - because of the Russian citizens living in South Ossetia - could be compared to when Hitler used the alleged suffering of ethnic Germans in the Sudetenland as a pretext for annexing Czechoslovakia in 1938.</p> <p>In an interview with the conservative German daily Die Welt, he said even more striking were the parallels between Putin's strategy against Georgia and Stalin's invasion of Finland in 1939, describing both as \"the undermining of the sovereignty of a small, democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence\". He added: \"Georgia is to an extent the Finland of today, both morally and strategically.\"</p> <p>Polish-born Brezinski, 80, who earned a reputation as a hardliner due to his anti-Soviet politics, said the world was now being confronted with the question as to how it should react to Russia and what he saw as its efforts to \"reincorporate old Soviet areas into the Kremlin's sphere of control\". He said at the heart of the issue was access to oil and specifically who controlled the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline which runs through Georgia.</p> <p>\"If Georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, but we can also assume that Putin will exercise a similar strategy against Ukraine if he faces resistance. He's already publicly voiced threats against Ukraine.\"</p> <p>\"If Russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community,\" he said, including economic sanctions on which all alliances from the European Union to Nato would have to take a joint stand.</p> <p>He added that Russia's invasion of Georgia was proof of the failure of the White House during George Bush's eight year tenure, to recognise the \"Putin regime\" for what it really was.</p> <p>\"Two episodes illustrate this better than any others,\" he said. \"First, when Bush met Putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him. Secondly, when Condi Rice, not so long ago, said that the American-Russian relations had never been better than they are today.\" He said the White House had deceived itself.</p> <p>Asked why it was that he only spoke of Putin and not of the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, Brzezinski said: \"He [Medvedev] has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the Soviet Union of the 1950s had over the Soviet Union. Nobody can even remember his name.\"</p>",
  "<p>Boukpeti celebrates his bronze medal. Photograph: Tim Wimborne/Reuters</p> <p>Just when one story escapes, another arrives in its place. I'd come here hoping to see two British medals, instead I saw one, and something very special in place of the other. The whitewater arena at Shunyi rowing and canoeing park seats a staggering 40,000 people, a string of eight squat stands encircling the jagged-edged concrete basin through which the water flows at the rate of 17 cubic metres per second.</p> <p>That sounds fierce to a layman, and the competitors confirmed that the Chinese have constructed a ferociously difficult course. That much was obvious in the semi-finals of both the C1 and K1 (that's one-man canoe and one-man kayak in case you were curious), which cut the fields from 12 down to eight in both fields.</p> <p>The four to miss out in the kayaking included Campbell Walsh, the spry, wiry Scot who won silver in this event at Athens in 2004. Walsh, normally a fine technician, struggled for speed around the first half of the course, a victim perhaps of his own desire to \"play it safe\" in the semi and then take more risks in the final - the two times being combined to produce the crucial cumulative score. Walsh, struggling, clipped a post and incurred a two-second penalty, which was enough to put him last by a distance.</p> <p>Disconsolate, he can take solace not just in the silver he already has, but the fact that Peter Kauzer, the Slovenian world No2 and strong favourite was also eliminated. While Walsh disconsolately circled the warm-down pool after crossing the line, the furious Kauzer snapped his paddle across the bow of his boat and screamed in fury.</p> <p>The course, 280 metres of furious water in a tight channel, riddled with eddies and vortexes (allowing the baseball park-style American announcer Kent Ford to scream \"he's stuck in the vortex\" at the top his voice) was also too hard for the two-time Olympic gold medallist, Tony Estanguet. \"I don't know what it is\" Estanguet explained dolefully to an angry horde of French journalists, \"if I did I'd be in the final. Technically this is very different from other courses\".</p> <p>The entire sport seems implausibly difficult: the power and dexterity needed to sway body and boat around the poles and through the narrow gates is such an unlikely combination. The boats appear to be swept along like leaves in the current, only for the athletes to swing them around and cut back upstream, limbo-ing the poles. The degree of control the athletes exercise in such a savage environment is bafflingly impressive.</p> <p>Rarely more so than on David Florence's second run. Florence, born in Aberdeen, turned 26 on the day of the opening ceremony, which of course was held on the eighth of the eighth because it's a lucky number for the Chinese.</p> <p>After his first run he was sitting fourth overall, but his second was 88.15, quick enough to push him past Australia's Robin Bell into first. The next man out - Krysztof Bieryt, nearly capsized turning back through gate 16, while Satanislav Jezek clipped his third pole, meaning Florence was guaranteed silver.</p> <p>And that was what he finished with: Michal Martikan, who became Slovakia's first ever gold medal winner when he won this event in 1996 aged just 17, was master of the course. Despite clipping the 19th gate, he finished almost two seconds ahead in first. From the size of the grin he was wearing, you could tell Florence wasn't too unhappy about that.</p> <p>As exciting as it was for Florence, the crowd's affections were stolen by a Togolese named Benjamin Boukpeti in the K1. Even as the eliminated Walsh was finishing his run, roars of \"TO-GO! TO-GO!\" were coming from the stands.</p> <p>Boukpeti produced a blistering first run, stealing first place by just a hundredth of a second. The pressmen turned to each other, muttering \"who is this guy?\" and tapped his name into google. Togo have never won an Olympic medal, even though they've been in the Games since 1972.</p> <p>Boukpeti, 27, was one good run away from becoming a national hero. Born in Lagny, France, his father was Togolese but he now lives in Toulouse. Having finished 18th in the semi-final of this event in Athens, no one was even giving Boukpeti a sniff of a chance before the race, understandably given that his world ranking was a lowly 56th. He could have chosen to compete for France, but dislocated his shoulders when he was a teenager and slipped through their national system. Togo though, were glad to have him.</p> <p>With Germany's Alexander Grimm having set an exceptional time of 171.70, Boukpeti needed to make 85.62 on his second run to win. At the second split he was two hundredths of a second inside and the stadium was going nuts screaming in support. He lost time at the close, crossed the line in 173.45, enough to win a bronze that made him Togo's first ever Olympic medallist, a small but significant slice of history.</p> <p>He too snapped his paddle after finishing, only it was in pure joy rather than anger, the smile on his face too wide to measure. I'd love to see the front pages of the Togolese papers tomorrow morning.</p>",

  "<p>Sir Bill Cotton, who has died aged 80, was managerially responsible for many of the BBC's most loved and enduring programmes in its 1960s and 70s golden age of comedy.</p> <p>He was unusual in being a broadcasting executive whose background was in show business rather than the grimmer-faced bureaucracy of news and current affairs.</p> <p>Cotton was always close to the centre of showbiz as the son of the popular and raucous band leader Billy (\"Wakey, wakey!\") Cotton, whose robust drollery enlivened both BBC radio and TV as well as theatre venues and smart hotels.</p> <p>The younger Cotton was welcomed by a wide range of talent when he became head of BBC light entertainment, then controller of BBC1 and finally managing director of BBC TV, because, unlike many of his predecessors, he was visibly open to drama and light entertainment values. </p> <p>He knew, without asking a marketing man, what thrilled him and what made him laugh - and what might therefore thrill and amuse an audience.</p> <p>One of the most genial and least faceless top executives in the BBC's slippery corridors of power, Cotton was tall, bespectacled, a ready listener yet capable of firm decisions. </p> <p>At a very public reception an anti-BBC campaigning journalist found that Cotton refused to answer his questions or say a word to him and, when the journalist failed to take the hint, pointedly and very visibly turned his back on him. If there were any red faces, Cotton's was not one of them.</p> <p>A straightforward man, Cotton was rarely frightened to turn his back, recognising that that dangerous process was necessary to looking ahead - even at the risk of knifings. He survived until he retired at the regulation age of 60 in 1988, was made CBE the following year, and was knighted in 2001.</p> <p>Uncle Bill, as he was known even to people older than he was, was familiar to everyone in the days when the BBC had more than 20,000 staff. Employees found that he was as friendly - and direct - with the cleaning ladies as he was with heads of departments.</p> <p>Cotton's greatest achievement was as head of light entertainment. He discovered or developed Dave Allen, Morecambe and Wise, the Two Ronnies, Porridge, Monty Python, Dad's Army and many others. </p> <p>He actually liked creative people and the front men he employed. Repeatedly ribbed on air by Terry Wogan, then at the height of his popularity as a chatshow host, Cotton responded by sitting on his lap and kissing him. It was a gesture a million miles over the top by BBC standards, but revealed a controlled flamboyance that was wheeled out when it suited his purpose.</p> <p>Cotton's background was as respectable as any bandleader's son's could be. Born in London, he was a boarder at Ardingly College in Sussex, and did his national service in the Royal Army Service Corps. </p> <p>After working in the music division of Chappells, in 1952 he went to the Michael Reine Music Company as joint managing director (1952-56). His father had drummed three things into him: to know what you were doing, to work very hard at it and to have a lot of luck.</p> <p>It was luck that he joined the BBC as a light entertainment producer in 1956 - the year of the Suez crisis, when it became obvious to the more perceptive that Britain's reputation and values were entering a period of testing change that was bound to be reflected in light entertainment.</p> <p>The previous year young Bill Cotton had taken over his father's Billy Cotton Bandshow for a broadcast after his father suffered a sudden and temporary nervous collapse. Bill used his father's voice but some of his own humour, and his appearance was praised. </p> <p>Once he was in the BBC, he produced more than 80 editions of his father's show, which in a sense heralded the changes which were to come. In the hands of Cotton senior, who was never afraid to blow a raspberry at the toffs, the show was already more pawky and irreverent than most popular entertainment.</p> <p>To the younger Cotton, producing his father's shows was a lesson in staying in control. It was also a contacts book of show business in both Britain and America. </p> <p>Though charmed by American artists including the singer Perry Como, the American dominance at an impressionable stage of Cotton's life made him determined one day to create British stars for British television, which he did later with Val Doonican as a European equivalent of Como. Cotton was to quip time and time again: \"Given the choice, we ought to use our rubbish.\"</p> <p>When Cotton joined the BBC, there was still a house directive banning jokes about a whole range of subjects, including honeymoon couples and effeminacy in men. </p> <p>By the time he became head of variety in 1967, after the subversive That Was The Week That Was and the satire movement of which it was a part, and then head of light entertainment in 1970, the rules were loosening up: Cotton, never lacking in common sense, sometimes felt the need to apply the brakes.</p> <p>Three years after being appointed head of light entertainment, Cotton found himself putting round directives to producers about the excessive use of bad language that had followed the bridgehead established by the cockney bigot Alf Garnett in the television series Till Death Us Do Part - while at the same time defending the right of writers to deal in comedy terms with previously unacceptable subjects. </p> <p>He claimed that anything could be the subject of comedy provided the approach was right, and cited the successful series My Wife Next Door, which made divorce funny by treating with affection and respect a couple who found that after divorce they were accidentally living next door to one another.</p> <p>Cotton revered artists and gave them a chance to breathe - he even gave the puppet Basil Brush his own programme. When he gave the singer Cilla Black her chance, he defended the move by saying he saw her as a version of the British Gracie Fields rather than the American Barbra Streisand.</p> <p>When he became controller of BBC1 in 1977, his first act was to axe two American series his predecessor had bought. He once boasted that in the 15 years he had been with BBC light entertainment, the Americans Perry Como, Dick Van Dyke and Lucille Ball had disappeared from the schedules. </p> <p>It was a historical irony that much later Cotton was to protest vehemently - and successfully - when Thames TV wrested the American soap opera Dallas from the BBC while the BBC thought it was still negotiating with the US distributors.</p> <p>The early 1980s saw Cotton's career apparently in the doldrums as he was shuffled into a job masterminding the BBC's involvement in Direct Broadcasting By Satellite (DBS), which turned out to be a non-involvement. </p> <p>But the abrupt removal of Aubrey Singer as managing director of a BBC TV service losing ground to ITV gave Cotton his chance as his successor. </p> <p>He soon brought in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/12/bbc.television1\">Michael Grade</a>, an ex-ITV man but a kindred spirit, first as controller of BBC1 and then as director of programmes. The two men started to win back lost ground - partly through the successful soap opera EastEnders.</p> <p>Grade dubbed Cotton a very clever negotiator who always told artists the truth about themselves - intelligent if no intellectual; intuitive and wise; unselfish and (a rare accolade) perhaps not ambitious enough on his own behalf.</p> <p>It was true that Cotton could have made much more money had he accepted one of the share-adorned offers made to him at various times by ITV. He was simply more interested in programme and personal distinction than in greed. </p> <p>He was a golfer and a magistrate. It was while sitting on the Richmond Bench that he met a fellow magistrate 25 years his junior, Kate Burgess; he shared his life with her after separating from his second wife, Ann Henderson, and marrying Burgess in 1990. </p> <p>Both resigned from the Bench amid a BBC-bashing campaign by some tabloid newspapers.</p> <p>Cotton's career, unlike that of most BBC top brass, did not end with his departure from the corporation. He went on to head the TV arm of the Noel Gay Agency, as chairman of Noel Gay Television, luring the presenter Sue Lawley, for instance, to ITV when her BBC TV career appeared to be in the doldrums. </p> <p>He arranged a deal worth \u00a3350,000 while simultaneously keeping her in her prestigious BBC radio Desert Island Discs slot - a feat typical of his avuncular brand of diplomacy. He is survived by Kate and the three daughters of his first marriage, to Bernadine Sinclair, who died in 1964. </p> <p><strong>WIlliam Frederick \"Bill\" Cotton, broadcasting executive, born April 23 1928; died August 11 2008</strong></p>",
  "<p>If JJ Abrams were any other director, the news that the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3id0839a35f93f478494fc466b33db0a25\">Lost creator is planning an earthquake disaster movie</a> would probably fail to register on any scale, Richter or otherwise. </p> <p>However, this being Abrams, Universal's announcement today that he is working with original Omen screenwriter David Seltzer on the project is noteworthy because it may well be all we find out about the film until the day of its release. </p> <p>Abrams' previous project, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/01/actionandadventure.drama\">Cloverfield, revolutionised film marketing strategies</a> by keeping almost all details of its story under wraps until the movie hit cinemas. Its name wasn't announced until late in the production process, and even then there were suggestions that it was a working title, or that Abrams would have preferred not to have had a name at all if he could have got away with it.</p> <p>Whether Abrams will once again employ the other innovation he brought on board for Cloverfield - eschewing the expected helicopter shots of a ravaged city in favour of shooting the action from his characters' point of view - remains to be seen. The only smidgen of information to emanate from the Universal camp this morning was that the film will hold true to the film-maker's preference for strong character-driven drama. And no, it won't be a remake of the 1974 hit Earthquake.</p> <p>Abrams will produce the film but has not yet signed on to direct, suggesting that he may once again employ a colleague in that role, just as he did with Cloverfield, on which Matt Reeves called the shots.</p>",

  "<p> Soul brothers ... Charles Bukowski and Ken Barlow. Photographs: Fabian Cevallos/Corbis/PR</p> <p>British TV soaps do a commendable job of highlighting social issues in their storylines, and Coronation Street was no exception last night when it featured a cautionary tale about <a href=\"http://coronationstreetupdates.blogspot.com/\">the serious consequences of trying to become an author</a>.</p> <p>Corrie mainstay Ken Barlow (actor Bill Roache) was over a matter of days transformed from the affable voice of reason on the street to a whisky-guzzling, unshaven novelist in the mould of Charles Bukowski.</p> <p>After attending a university reunion, Ken had realised that he'd never fulfilled his youthful potential as the Boy Most Likely To Become A Published Writer. He resolved to correct this state of affairs at once, dragging down from the attic the Great British Novel he had started as an angry young man.</p> <p>The unfinished novel exerts an almost supernatural hold on Ken, and before long he's drinking Glenmorangie from china mugs and unbuttoning his shirt to the chest. I was half expecting him to pick-axe his way through the door like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.</p> <p>If every author has his muse, then Ken's long-suffering wife Deirdre turned out to be his anti-muse, and after having a nosy at his manuscript accused him of using her as the basis for one of his characters, a \"chain-smoking fishwife\". She raged about how he was basing his book on his own life, \"the clever grammar school boy, born in the back streets of Manchester, dealing with the fools and harridans around him as he struggles to escape his roots ...\"</p> <p>Of course, Ken Barlow isn't the only soap character to have literary ambitions. Back in the days when Jason Donovan was just a fresh-faced surfer boy with spiky hair, his character Scott in the Down Under soap Neighbours embarked upon the Great Australian Novel.</p> <p>And while Emmerdale's Jack Sugden (played latterly by the late Clive Hornby) finished his days worrying about milk yields and Bluetongue, when he was first introduced into the soap in 1972 he was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/clive-hornby-jack-sugden-in-emmerdale-860523.html\">a thrusting young would-be author</a> who took himself off to Italy to write his magnum opus.</p> <p>Over in the States the soap characters go one further - they not only write books, but <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/07/business/media/07charm.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/S/Soap%20Operas\">have them published in the real world</a> as well. Kendall Hart, a character in the ABC soap All My Children, wrote a novel called Charm. It was subsequently published earlier this year under the character's name, and has since shifted more than 100,000 copies, a figure to make most flesh-and-blood authors drool.</p> <p>Of course, Ken's writerly aspirations ultimately come to nothing. Realising after a quick re-read of Alan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning that he will never make the grade, and that his true role in life is to dispense nuggets of wisdom in the Rovers, he poignantly burns his manuscript on the barbecue in the back yard, branding it \"derivative tosh\".</p> <p>That isn't to say Coronation Street won't have a resident wordsmith, though. When Ken's acid-tongued mother-in-law Blanche ventured into his writing den she observed that it \"smelled like an anchovy's jockstrap\", and with imagery like that at her disposal she could go very far indeed.</p>",
  "<p><br>Driving force ... Chris Evans. Photograph: Huw John/Rex</p> <p>Say what you like about Chris Evans (and please do) but he knows a good radio feature when he hears one. What distinguishes his <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/evans/\">Radio 2 drivetime show</a> is not the music or the chat, but the daily array of likeable regular moments and slots: Fox the Fox; Woman's Minute; Gobsmackers; The D-Spot; In the Locker; and, my current personal favourite, Top Tenuous. </p> <p>The latter is perfect radio, with listeners invited to submit their thrillingly tenuous associations with a famous person in the news that day. What flows into the studio is gorgeously low-key, offbeat and convoluted, replete with connections to celebrity via sisters-in-law, third cousins twice removed, and acquaintances not seen since primary school. These are then organised into a chart that privileges the most tenuous and downright silly.</p> <p>Radio features (by which I mean a repeated, formulaic item in the programme schedule) are the punctuation of shows, whether it's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/thought/\">Thought for the Day</a>, the newspaper review on The Today Programme, or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/bruce/popmaster.shtml\">Popmaster with Ken Bruce</a>. You can set your watch by them, and they provide a valuable sense of familiarity and connection for listeners. They are responsible for some of the most inventive - but also some of the laziest - broadcasting.</p> <p>A good show, with a confident, amiable identity, will always have a strong set of unique features. Steve Wright in the Afternoon is a prime example: you might not relish his \"factoids\" but they tell you without doubt which show you are listening to. And I do love <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/wright/ask_elvis.shtml\">Ask Elvis</a>.</p> <p>The gruesome, lazy stuff includes things such as the \"guess the year\" hour or half-hour of music and facts, and I imagine there are still stations out there somewhere filling the schedules with this torpid old nonsense. But mostly, national networks have sharpened up their features, reworking the old ones successfully, and coming up with perky new ways to keep us listening.</p> <p>Thinking about the best and worst ones, now and in the past, however, led me to a worrying thought: is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1cha0cmnyc\">Our Tune</a> the best radio feature ever? The supporting evidence is pretty strong. It's still reworked with different twists (Jo Whiley's quite nauseating <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/jowhiley/changingtracks.shtml\">Changing Tracks</a>, for example); we all still know that theme tune, and everyone of a certain age remembers the programme. I can still remember one or two (massively depressing) Our Tunes tales quite clearly from the early 80s.</p> <p>So, do we simply have to concede the crown to Our Tune, or is there anything else in radioland, past or present, to rival it?</p>",
  "<p>They came, they saw, they conceded. But that doesn't mean England's players escape the clutches of the Spin's marks out of 10 for the South Africa series. Without any further ado, here they are...</p> <p><strong>The batsmen</strong></p> <p><strong>Andrew Strauss: 180 runs at 25.71</strong></p> <p>Saved his best until last, which is not saying much. But for all the stodginess in Strauss's new-found tendency to shoulder arms to balls that once tempted him, the KP era is crying out for experience, which is why yesterday's 58 was so important. And there are signs, too, that his opening partnership with Cook is starting to take shape. Tall opening bowlers, though, will have noted his discomfort when Morne Morkel went round the wicket. There is still plenty to work on. <strong>Mark out of 10: 5</strong></p> <p><strong>Alastair Cook: 329 runs at 47.00; no wkt for 1</strong></p> <p>Graham Gooch and Andy Flower have always emphasised the need for their fellow Essex man to score big, but the figures mask a worrying trend. Four times in the series Cook reached 60; not once did he go beyond 76. His Test career now divides tellingly into two chunks of 31 innings each: the first brought six of his hundreds, the second just one. England need him to iron out an off-stump flaw in the eight Tests before the Ashes, otherwise Stuart Clark could have a field day. <strong>Mark: 7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Vaughan: 40 runs at 8.00</strong></p> <p>Only during a hectic 17 in what could be his final Test innings did Vaughan suggest he was ever going to ease his way out of a slump. Duncan Fletcher, who knows his game better than anyone, believed he was getting too square-on, but there was also a lack of shot-selection which betrayed desperation. His captaincy was as pro-active as ever, possibly too much so, but it will need him to change the habit of a career and score plenty of runs for Yorkshire if there is to be an Ashes swansong. <strong>Mark: 3/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Kevin Pietersen: 421 runs at 60.14; 1 wkt at 52.00</strong></p> <p>KP alone can score so many runs and still divide opinion. Was that ill-fated shot on 94 at Edgbaston a symptom of hubris or the prerogative of genius? The Spin errs towards the latter. His ability to rise to the occasion has a Brian Lara-like quality, but he must make sure his captaincy does not drift in the same direction. Lara had his moments of tactical inspiration, but too often he was aloof. Pietersen must be inclusive - and not talk too much about beating Australia (that's the job of hysterical weekly emails). It's not as if they need their card marking, is it KP? <strong>Mark: 9/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ian Bell: 332 runs at 47.42</strong></p> <p>It's not so much a case of \"Will the real Ian Bell please stand up?\" as \"Is there a real Ian Bell at all?\" His 199 at Lord's was feted as a breakthrough, since when he scored 31, 4, 50, 20, 24 and 4, and encouraged renewed talk of mental frailty. His modes of dismissal haven't helped, least of all the mis-hook in the first innings at Edgbaston and the loss of his leg-stump to Makhaya Ntini yesterday. If he really wants the No3 slot, he's got to start earning it, although do stop the Spin if you've heard that one before. <strong>Mark: 6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul Collingwood: 232 runs at 58.00; no wkt for 52</strong></p> <p>Terribly though South Africa bowled during the second innings at Edgbaston, Collingwood's 135 was one of the feel-good stories of a gloomy summer. They used to say that the perfect batsman would combine Steve Waugh's grit with his twin Mark's grace: Collingwood and Bell provoke the same wistfulness. Sod's Law dictates that the Test summer is over just as Collingwood has dusted himself off, but on current form no other player looks more likely to share the top-six burden currently being carried by Pietersen. <strong>Mark: 8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>The all-rounders</strong></p> <p><strong>Andrew Flintoff: 113 runs at 28.25; 9 wkts at 36.44</strong></p> <p>As so often, the bowling figures do not quite reflect the sweat, toil and tears. That spell to Jacques Kallis on the second evening at Edgbaston seemed to redeem our faith in Test cricket in an age of Twenty20 mania, but if we didn't know it before, we ought to now: Flintoff is not a strike bowler. An enforcer capable of earning wickets at the other end, yes, but not a thinking seamer capable of outwitting the best on a regular basis. And his batting, as if we needed proof, is the stuff of No7, not No6. Balancing the team with Flintoff in it remains one of the side's biggest challenges. <strong>Mark: 7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Stuart Broad: 161 runs at 53.66; 8 wkts at 49.00</strong></p> <p>Outstanding in one discipline, barely adequate in the other, Broad can only play in a five-man attack. The potential is there, all right, but he must not strive for pace that doesn't exist, as he did while Hashim Amla was hitting him for five fours in 10 balls during South Africa's second innings at The Oval. His batting, despite Friday's struggles, was one of the delights of the series, especially that back-foot cover force. <strong>Mark: 6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>The wicket-keeper</strong></p> <p><strong>Tim Ambrose: 97 runs at 16.16; nine catches</strong></p> <p>Oh dear. The heart says England must stick with a keeper if they are ever to develop one capable of filling Alec Stewart's gloves. The head says that keeper isn't Ambrose. Without the square-cut he is a third of the batsman who hit a hundred at Wellington; grit alone, as displayed while performing the role of sacrificial lamb at No6 at Headingley, is not enough. England have served him badly by moving him around the batting order, and his keeping is tidy enough, but Matt Prior's time has come round once more. <strong>Mark: 4/10</strong></p> <p><strong>The bowlers</strong></p> <p><strong>Jimmy Anderson: 15 wkts at 33.93; 60 runs at 15.00</strong></p> <p>Yes, folks, this time he really has matured. The old Jimmy would not have swung the ball into Graeme Smith's pads so accurately in the first over of South Africa's second innings at The Oval; the old Jimmy would not have gone for just 2.93 runs an over all series; and the old Jimmy would not have hung around for two hours as nightwatchman at Headingley. Some of the inconsistencies inherent in swing bowling remain, but 34 Test wickets in the summer tell their own story. <strong>Mark: 8/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Ryan Sidebottom: 6 wkts at 32.33; 25 runs at 12.50</strong></p> <p>Does anyone else have the nagging feeling we may already have seen the best of Sidebottom? His selection at Edgbaston when he was plainly unfit was a more grievous selectorial blunder than Darren Pattinson, and arguably cost England the series: he was only able to bowl 10 overs out of 80 in the fourth innings. And his treatment of Monty Panesar in the same game was shameful. If he can come again, great; if not, we may be looking at the kind of short-lived international career that becomes more common as the calendar buckles. <strong>Mark: 5/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Monty Panesar: 13 wkts at 31.69; 11 runs at 2.75</strong></p> <p>Irritations remain over his lack of variety, but why the stick over his second-innings performance at Edgbaston? On another day appeals for caught behind and lbw against Graeme Smith would have been correctly upheld, which would have meant all to play for at The Oval. But despite topping England's averages, he needs to be careful about three things: Pietersen will not set his fields with the same autocracy as Vaughan, so he will need to work things out for himself; umpires will no longer tolerate his lip when decisions don't go his way; and his batting has regressed to sub-No11. Still, not quite the crisis some are depicting. <strong>Mark: 6/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Steve Harmison: 4 wkts at 33.25; 49 runs without being dismissed</strong></p> <p>What have we learned about Harmison that we didn't already know? He likes overs under his belt, he enjoys a pitch with bounce, he feels less pressure in a dead match than an Ashes opener, and he prefers to bang it in short of a length than float it up to the bat. Mysteriously, England have pulled him out of Durham's game at home to Nottinghamshire today when he wanted to play, and there are worries about the lack of cricket ahead of the first Test at Ahmedabad in December. But at least we can safely say that, unlike Matthew Hoggard, the Ashes remains in sight. <strong>Mark: 7/10</strong></p> <p><strong>Darren Pattinson: 2 wkts at 48.00; 21 runs at 10.50</strong></p> <p>It wasn't his fault. <strong>Mark: 6/10</strong></p> <p><em>Extract taken from <a href=\"http://sport.guardian.co.uk/thespin/0,,806133,00.html\">The Spin</a>, guardian.co.uk's weekly take on the world of cricket.

  "<p>Photograph: Rex Features</p> <p>Sex sells. But fear, pain and desperation sell even more effectively. </p> <p>This press release from the creators of <a href=\"http://www.lifemel.co.uk/\">Life Mel honey</a> is an object lesson in that despicable dark art. Their target is cancer patients struggling to deal with the horrible side-effects of their treatment: </p> <blockquote> <p>Chemotherapy is often terminated by patients wishing to live their final weeks or months without the harsh side effects of the treatment, but Life Mel offers new hope with less side effects.</p> </blockquote> <p>What is this miraculous \"new hope\"? The release tells us more:</p> <blockquote> <p>Life Mel is a unique food product made by honey bees fed on a unique diet including selected herbs such as Siberian ginseng, echinacea and <em>Uncaria tomentosa</em> based on over 30 years research. It is proven to boost immunity before, during [and] after chemotherapy, dramatically reducing the side effects of treatment so patients can live a more normal life.</p> </blockquote> <p>The so-called \"proof\" that it boosts immunity does not, in fact, come from 30 years of research but is based on one small study conducted by Israeli researchers in 2006. More about that in a moment but put it this way, relying on it alone as a basis for Life Mel's effectiveness would be like asking Northern Rock for mortgage advice.</p> <p>What does Life Mel do? The honey - which is produced by <a href=\"http://www.holywell-health.com/\">Holywell Health</a> - supposedly targets neutropenia, a side-effect of chemotherapy in which the level of a particular class of white blood cells drops, leaving the patient open to infection. But this dangerous side-effect of chemotherapy could disappear, the company claims, if you purchase a pot of special honey - a bargain at \u00a337.50.</p> <p>Of course, no quack remedy would be complete without a celebrity endorsement. In this case, it is the actress <a href=\"http://www.holby.tv/db/index.php?id=39,1267,0,0,1,0\">Rebekah Gibbs</a> who plays hospital technician <a href=\"http://www.holby.tv/db/index.php?id=5,1318,0,0,1,0\">Nina Farr in the BBC drama Casualty</a>. Gibbs was diagnosed as having breast cancer in January and since April has been writing a <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/life-style/sex-health/rebekahs-journey/\">diary about her treatment for the Mirror</a>.</p> <p>After seeing her newspaper column, the PR folks for Life Mel kindly sent her agent some sample pots of their honey to try, and in a subsequent column and video on the Mirror's website she <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/life-style/sex-health/2008/07/30/video-rebekah-s-journey-my-hair-s-growing-back-115875-20677470/\">told her reader about it</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>This week I've started taking a special honey. It's called Life Mel and at more than \u00a337.50 a pop it isn't cheap, but it's supposed to work wonders ... I'm taking two teaspoons per day and so far so good, I figure there's no harm done as it's so natural.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her agent said that Gibbs is not being paid to promote the product.</p> <p>Natural it might be, but does Life Mel actually work? The company's PR people claim that they have received hundreds of positive accounts from patients. \"Life Mel constantly receives letters and phone calls from people who have tried the product and felt the benefits,\" said Carolanne Bamford. Hollywell Health claims to have sold more than 20,000 jars.</p> <p>But anecdotes are meaningless as evidence. That is why we don't allow companies to sell drug treatments based on the say-so of a handful of patients who claim to have got better.</p> <p>That brings us back to the <a href=\"http://www.holywell-health.com/img/news/Lifemeltrial2006.pdf\">one scientific study to have looked at Life Mel's effectiveness</a>. By the researchers' own account, this study is a long way from the gold standard clinical trial that would provide rigorous proof the honey works. For a start it is small - just 30 cancer patients - and it does not include the obvious control group, other patients given ordinary, non-magic honey. </p> <p>The scientists report that anaemia lessened in 64% of the patients - as measured by levels of haemoglobin in their blood - but with no controls to compare with they can't be sure whether this was simply due to the extra attention patients were given because they were participating in a trial. In other words a placebo effect.</p> <p>One author, Prof Eitan Friedman, head of the Susanne Levy Gertner Oncogenetics Unit at Chaim Sheba Medical Centre in Israel, seems irritated that the company uses the study and his name to promote the product.</p> <blockquote> <p>As far as I am concerned this was just a preliminary study that was not adequately controlled [and] lacked any statistical power to detect any meaningful benefits ... Having my name attached to the publicity brochures and websites sponsored by Life Mel and claiming that I support this specific product is a false and inaccurate representation of the truth.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[It is] certainly not sufficiently evidence-based, certainly too preliminary, certainly not based on any concrete facts or statistics that may justify any claim as to its superiority or proven benefit to the general public.</p> </blockquote> <p>Life Mel's PR agents said the company provided honey for the trial but did not fund it. </p> <p>By preying on the fear and desperation of cancer patients, Holywell Health is raising false hopes with a product that has only the flimsiest evidence for its effectiveness. It is easy to see why <a href=\"http://www.breastcancercare.org.uk/bcc-forum/discussion/11532/life-mel-honey/\">vulnerable patients would be tempted to try Life Mel honey</a>, but my advice would be to save your money.</p>",

As well as the surroundings, including views of the Forth and the magnificence of the house itself, there's a smashing tearoom. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.hopetounhouse.com\">Hopetoun House</a>, South Queensferry; +44 (0)131 331 2451.

Linlithgow Palace</h2> <p>Perched beside a lovely loch and beside the 15th-century St Michael's Church (which is topped with a terribly modern steeple), Linlithgow Palace was where Mary Queen of Scots was born in 1542. Two hundred years later, it was visited by Bonnie Prince Charlie and was mostly destroyed in 1746 by the Duke of Cumberland's advancing army. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/linlithgow/linlithgowpalace/index.html\"> Linlithgow Palace</a>, Linlithgow, +44 (0)1506 842 896.

Gullane</h2> <p>Blessed with both beaches and golf courses, there are plenty of wonderful walks to be had in Gullane, a lovely town to the east of Edinburgh along the A198.

Shark diving in Fife</h2> <p>You don't have to go as far as South Africa to get your Jaws experience. Shark diving in Fife's Deep Sea World involves jumping in an aquarium rather than the big blue and there are no Great Whites; however, this means you won't have suffer the North Sea's biting temperatures and, as the resident Sand Tiger sharks aren't considered dangerous to humans, no protective cages are needed.

Beecraigs Country Park</h2> <p>Among other things in the 913 acres of the park, which sits in the Bathgate Hills near Linlithgow, you'll find a deerpark, a saw mill, a fishery and facilities for outdoor pursuits, such as archery, canoeing, climbing and orienteering. Alternatively, you could just take a picnic and relish the countryside instead. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Beecraigs Country Park, West Lothian, EH49 6PL; <a href=\"http://www.beecraigs.com/\">beecraigs.com</a>; +44 (0)1506 844516</p> <h2>9. Musselburgh</h2> <p>Dubbed \"the honest toun\", Musselburgh is perched on the coastal outskirts of Edinburgh and is blessed, not just with picturesque scenery, a dandy beach and good travel links to the city centre, but also a racecourse and \u2013 most important of all - one of Scotland's most famous ice cream parlours \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.lucasicecream.co.uk/ \">S Luca</a>. Founded in the town in 1908, it's one of many established in the country by Italian immigrants and, to this day, it remains a family business.</p> <h2>10. Glasgow</h2> <p>Sacrilegious though it sounds, a visit to Edinburgh's grittier sister city takes only 50 minutes by train and counts, during festival time anyway, as an oasis of calm with nary a stilt walker, desperate student theatre company or mime artist to be seen. Although there may be the occasional busker on Buchanan Street, known for its shopping, or in the caf\u00e9-dotted streets of the Merchant City, Glasgow could nevertheless provide welcome respite from the crowds of Edinburgh.

  "<p>Inflation soared to 4.4% last month - the biggest jump in the cost of living in more than 16 years - on the back of rocketing food prices, clouding hopes that the Bank of England will move to cut interest rates in coming months..</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said today that the consumer prices index (CPI), the government's preferred inflation measure, leapt to an annual rate of 4.4%, up from 3.8% in June. This beat analysts' expectations of inflation of 4.1%, and is more than double the government's target.</p> <p>This is the highest level recorded since the CPI series began in January 1997. According to analysts, inflation was last higher in April 1992 when it hit 4.7%.</p> <p>The main driver was hefty rises in food prices, particularly bacon, ham and poultry. The cost of meat on the year was up a record 13.7%. Bread and cereal prices also shot up and fuel inflation was at an all-time high as well.<br> Conservative leader David Cameron said inflation was \"yet another worrying signal\" for families, who are already battling against sharp increases in their cost of living from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/11/householdbills.regulators\">higher utility bills</a>, petrol prices and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/07/fooddrinks\">spiralling grocery bills</a>.</p> <p>\"Hundreds of thousands of families now have the threat of negative equity hanging over them, businesses are cutting back, unemployment is creeping up and this morning's inflation figures are yet another worrying signal for families desperately trying to make ends meet,\" said Cameron at his monthly press conference today.</p> <p>And with the UK econony slowing, inflation is also a concern for policymakers on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/jul/22/monetarypolicy\">monetary policy committee</a> as they try to control inflation and keep it to their target rate of 2%. Today's figure was seen by the MPC last week when they decided to keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/07/interestrates.bankofenglandgovernor\">interest rates on hold at 5%</a> for the fourth consecutive month despite fears that the economy is on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/08/economicgrowth.economics\">brink of recession</a>.</p> <p>Analysts said the figures were particularly worrying since they did not reflect the recent hikes in utility bills by many energy companies. However, there may be a softening effect in the future from petrol prices following the recent slide in crude oil.</p> <p>Worryingly for policymakers concerned about second-round effects, the retail price index of inflation, on which many wage deals are based, shot up to 5%. This was the highest for 17 years. </p> <p>Core inflation, which strips out volatile items like food, energy and tobacco also edged up to 1.9% suggesting that weaker demand is not preventing firms from passing on their high costs to consumers.</p> <p>\"It looks possible that inflation will hit 5% within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index,\" said Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics. \"A rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda.\"</p> <p>Having analysed the health of the UK economy over the last few months, the Bank will reveal its latest forecasts for the inflation outlook tomorrow when its quarterly inflation report is published. Analysts are hoping that the report will signal the path of borrowing costs needed to bring inflation back to target in the coming months.</p> <p>Economists also expect that the Bank will slash its economic growth forecast for this year and next in the report to the lowest level since it was granted independence in 1997.</p> <p>The MPC has been faced with an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/interestrates.interestrates\">increasingly tough dilemma</a> when setting interest rates, having to juggle rising price pressures with the prospect of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/26/economics.economicgrowth\">sharp economic downturn</a>.</p> <p>The inflation numbers cast further gloom over the UK economy, which is already battling under the burden of the housing market slump, falling sales on the high street and rising unemployment.</p>",
  "<p>The rats threading the streets of Baltimore grow more confident each week. Not just the rodents scuttling away from the corpses McNulty, and now Freamon, but the liars, traitors and sellouts who are ratcheting up the tension as this series heads to its no doubt distressing climax.</p> <p>King of the Rats is the malodorous Cheese. Last week, his cheery betrayal of Butchie led to the return of a pumped-up Omar. This week, he walks out on his uncle, Prop Joe, just as Chris and Marlo walk in and calmly, coldly, blow his brains out.</p> <p>Cheese has always seemed to be mostly comprised of swagger and owes his position on the street purely to the strength of his blood ties. Now that blood is flowing over the floor of the co-op, it is surely (surely!) only a matter of time before he too is killed, yet the fleeting power afforded by betrayal seems to have been too attractive for him to pass up.</p> <p>Over in the western there are, as McNulty has always pointed out, both good and bad police, and both kinds can be rats. Carver, in doing the right thing by writing up his redneck officer Colicchio for an idiotic assault on an unwitting schoolteacher, knows he will now be seen by his men as suspect. Burrell, meanwhile, has left his sinking ship, his final flourish an offer to bring down Daniels. He offers to reveal the still unexplained events from back when both men were colleagues, but his offer is refused by the ambitious Nerise. She keeps Burrell's dodgy dossier though, no doubt for her own personal use at an apposite moment.</p> <p>Scott Templeton, meanwhile, even looks like a rat and is quickly becoming my most loathed character since season two's Ziggy. He shares Ziggy's amorality but also his ability to cast himself as the hero of every narrative. Scott's attempt to land a job at the Washington Post ends in failure, and so he childishly snubs an invite to the Post's editorial conference (a meeting he had been fantasising about only minutes earlier). No matter, he's soon back at the Sun vocally making out like he's doing everyone a favour by staying screwed to his seat. </p> <p>While Scott play acts, Gutierrez just keeps on making those calls, attempting to build a career in journalism the Gus Haynes way. The juxtaposition is stark and, in an episode entitled Transitions, it's just one of many. Gutierrez is always hardest at work when Scott is scamming. Bunk is rebuffed by Landesman on the bodies in the vacants only to be confronted by McNulty fantasising about more murders. What is more, Carver sees his career in jeopardy at precisely the same time as Herc gets a valuable new client, one Marlo Stanfield.</p> <p>The execution of Prop Joe has confirmed Marlo's ascent to the top of the pile in Baltimore's drug game. Even the Greeks know the boy is not to be messed with. His money is safe, his lieutenants have their rivals in their pockets and his chilling words as Chris puts the gun to Joe's head, \"Close your eyes, it won't hurt none\", have almost a religious air about them. Try as Omar might, you wonder if even his avenging angel stands a chance of thwarting this monster. </p> <p>\u00b7 Discuss the episode on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/the_wire_season_five_episode_f.html\">Steve Busfield's blog</a></p>",
  "<p>Here's a trick question: part I. When Brits on their summer holiday across (occasionally 35,000 feet above) sunny southern Europe get drunk, hospitalised and possibly jailed, whose fault is it? </p> <p>Usually theirs, of course, though it's always interesting to hear how keen some of them are to blame the poor old British consul for not finding their stolen passport - or opening the front door at three in the morning. </p> <p>It's all over page one of the Mail today, based on a Foreign Office reports which records a sharp rise in arrests - 2,032 in Spain last year, 1,415 in the US, 230 in Greece, on average 15% up. </p> <p>In Spain 1,591 Brits died in 2006-07, which sounds like a lot of pool drownings until you remember the pensioners who live - and die - in the sun. </p> <p>Junior Foreign Office minister, Meg Munn, was on the radio this morning, sensibly advising travellers to check the law and customs in countries they plan to visit. I often forget the French requirement that drivers must carry a triangle and fluorescent yellow jacket in the boot of the car. They can be very bureaucratic, the Frogs, though they tolerated sensational speeding until recently.</p> <p>What Munn really meant, of course, was drink, drugs and sex. Apparently, not everyone heads south for sunshine or museums. Some go to get bladdered and laid, so they tell me. It's not just the grown-ups either. Teenagers, free from mum and dad, do it too. </p> <p>Well, well. Serves them right, says me, if the Greek police take a less restrained view of their misconduct than they do down on the Quays in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In socially conservative countries - as ours was until quite recently - being pissed, aggressively loud and half-naked isn't thought acceptable. </p> <p>I realise the local boys take advantage of this deplorable phenomenon to get easy pickings, but hypocrisy is a universal trait, even among priests and mullahs, let alone barmen.</p> <p>Now to part II of the trick question. Who's to blame when someone who's got drunk later gets raped, abroad or at home? Well, the rapist, of course. Rape is a very nasty crime, though a flamboyant Tory politician - Nicholas Fairbairn QC - who later lost his job as Mrs Thatcher's Scottish solicitor general once got into trouble for observing that it was very close to a normal activity. It's one reason among several (no witnesses) why prosecution is so difficult.</p> <p>But what about compensation for rape victims? Just as today's Mail highlights the holiday binge drinkers on page one today, the Guardian carries a page one report under the headline <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/12/ukcrime.law\">Rape victims told alcoholic consumption may cost them compensation</a>.</p> <p>We learned that in the past year 14 rape victims have had their compensation trimmed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) because they had been drinking before they were attacked. </p> <p>In the case of Helen - a beauty therapist who has not worked since being raped - she got 25% knocked off her \u00a311,000 standard award. It felt like \"a slap in the face\", Helen told the paper. </p> <p>She also gave an interview - read by an actor to protect her anonymity - to Radio 4's Today programme which, so I assume, must also have been given the story. The legal wrangle prolonged her distress, Helen seemed to be suggesting. Her lawyer was outraged.</p> <p>The twist was that the CICA later changed its mind. It updated its response to the Guardian and BBC to say a mistake had been made in Helen's case: its policy is NOT to reduce awards to rape victims on the basis of alcohol consumption.</p> <p>Today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/women.justice\">Guardian editorial comment</a> endorses that position, calling for a change in the rules on alcohol, in part on the grounds that for many women, those who do not see their attacker convicted, monetary compensation from the public purse is a form of recognition for their suffering.</p> <p>I'm uneasy about this line of argument. Compensation for injury, civil and criminal, can be a pretty rough old business, with bomb victims sometimes getting much less than some pretty undeserving litigants who tripped on an uneven paving stone.</p> <p>The Guardian acknowledges that drink \"raises the risk of suffering rape, just as it increases the dangers of suffering from other violent crimes. No, the argument is that with rape there can be no divvying up of the blame.\"</p> <p>Indeed not. But surely compensation is not about blame, that's a matter for the criminal law. It's about weighing up the injury, what long-term distress, financial outlay or even unemployment, it may cause, and - one factor among several - whether the actions of the claimant may have contributed to his/her misfortune. In sum, it's about personal responsibility.</p> <p>If I get glassed in a pub during a fight which arose when I was drunk it's not quite the same as if I took the broken bottle in my eye as I soberly walked in, is it? If I wear conspicuously expensive clothes - or accent - and a Rolex watch in a rough part of town, drunk or sober, it's a crime to mug me. But, as the old saying goes, I was \"asking for it\" a bit, wasn't I? </p> <p>It's rather like the police saying - as they rightly do - \"don't carry a knife for protection, it may get you into trouble.\" </p> <p>You put yourself at risk, just as you do by speeding when the idiot coming the other way loses control of the car: his fault, but you were going too fast or (another common one) tail-gating.</p> <p>Yet I get into a lot of trouble with women friends whenever I suggest they have a responsibility to themselves to think about what they're wearing where they're wearing it. Ditto how much they drink. Ditto what I wear - and drink. Date rape drugs may be a problem, but rather less so than the happy hour, I suspect from the speed-drinking I see in bars.</p> <p>The fact that people go to enormous lengths to deny this factor seems to me part of the problem, just as it is when bladdered stag party boys get stroppy with the consul when they lose their passport in Riga. </p> <p>Everyone's a victim, no one's responsible. No wonder we have a discipline pandemic in school, at home and on the streets, not confined to the underclass either.</p> <p>As for Brits, tourist or ex-pats doing drugs and sex-on-the-beach in places like Dubai, where appearances matter (as they once did here) they must be mad. </p> <p>It's not Bradford or Barking, surely they can figure that out. For one thing it's hotter. That's why they're there. Or have they forgotten? Wonder why...</p>",

Nato's secretary-general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, told a news conference that the clock should be turned back. \"It is very important that all parties go back to the status quo ante, that is as it existed on August 6.\"</p> <p>De Hoop Scheffer also says that Nato stands by its commitment made at the Bucharest summit that Georgia will one day become a Nato member. Georgia's Nato aspirations have not gone down well with the Kremlin, which sees the arrival of a military alliance on its doorstep as a threat.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong></p> <p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is giving a press conference following his meeting with his Russian counterpart.</p> <blockquote> <p>We have had free and frank discussions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong></p> <p>Sarkozy continues:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is a Russian commitment to respect the sovereignty of Georgia... We are not at peace yet but we are at a stage of a temporary cessation of hostilities. We want the best possible result but there is a lot of work to do yet.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong></p> <p>There is now a Q&amp;A session going on with journalists. Sarkozy, who doesn't seem to be the sort of person to use 10 words when he can use 100, somewhat tortuously suggests that he hasn't been able to sort out all the Caucasus' problems in one day.</p> <p>Asked about Russia's attitude to Georgia's territorial integrity, Medvedev says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Territorial integrity is a complicated matter that cannot be solved in summits. It is up to people in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia to decide whether they want to live in the same state. That is a question they should be asked and they will answer unambiguously.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To a question from the Russian media about Russian reaction, Medvedev says his country was faced with Georgian aggression and reacted in the only way possible.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong></p> <p>Getty photographers have been filing images following <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-US&amp;family=editorial&amp;assetType=image&amp;p=gori&amp;src=standard\">fighting in Gori</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Search/Search.aspx?contractUrl=2&amp;language=en-US&amp;family=editorial&amp;assetType=image&amp;p=tskhinvali&amp;src=standard\">Tskhinvali</a>.</p> <p><strong>5pm</strong></p> <p>The following are, according to Reuters, what Medvedev said were the key elements of the peace plan:</p> <p>1) Agreement on the non-use of force.</p> <p>2) Cessation of all military action.</p> <p>3) Free access to humanitarian aid.</p> <p>4) Georgian military to return to their permanent bases.</p> <p>5) Russian military to return to the positions held before the current hostilities. Until international mechanisms are worked out, Russian peacekeepers will \"take additional security measures\".</p> <p>6) The start of international discussions on the status of South Ossetia and Abkhazia and on how to ensure their security. </p> <p>We are winding down our live blog of the day's events but breaking news from the region will continue to be covered on theguardian.com </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">More on the war in the Caucasus.</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Shamelessly brilliant</strong></p> <p>The Beijinger swears it saw Frank Gallagher from Shameless today as it walked through the Olympic zone. \"Tickets, spares, returns?\" he whined in a Mancunian accent that prompted bemused glances from locals. \"How is business?\" \"Shiiiiite mate,\" he told us, adjusting his wife-beater. \"Nothing going.\" Which isn't strictly true: plenty is going on, in all sorts of places.</p> <p>This morning the press were greeted with an armoured personal carrier outside MPC, which perturbed some of the more yellow-bellied members of the fourth estate (OK, one hysterical American). SWAT teams have also been deployed outside the athletes' village, although suggestions that they are there to keep Tom Daley away from Blake Aldridge are unfounded. Organisers say the increased security is in response to the murder of a US tourist - but if that's the case why wait three days?</p> <p>In the pool, meanwhile, there was yet another gold for Michael Phelps - and another world record too. Unless he's hit by fatigue or gets sucked into too many late nights playing Spades with his US team-mates he looks odds on to beat Mark Spitz's record, and, even more incredibly, break eight world records in the process.</p> <p>But it was a frustrating day in the water for the Brits. Gemma Spofforth finished fourth in the 100m backstroke final - 0.04 second off a bronze medal - having been 2nd with 25m to go. Liam Hancock could finish only sixth in the 100m backstroke final, despite leading at halfway. And although Caitlin McClatchey qualified for the 200m freestyle final by finishing third in her heat, Jo Jackson, who won bronze in the 400m yesterday, failed to make the cut. But an Olympic medal, and the prospect of another one in the 4x200 freestyle relay, will ease the pain somewhat.</p> <p><strong>What you missed overnight</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.michaelphelps\">The remarkable Michael Phelps</a> won his third gold medal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.paularadcliffe&quot;\">Paula Radcliffe</a> says she is ready to race on Sunday, but admits she has not made a full recovery from injury.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">Empty seats at Olympic venues</a> are a cause for concern for organisers.</p> <p>Over in the gynasium <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.gymnastics\">the home nation</a> have won the team gold.</p> <p>Britain's women's hockey team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicshockey&quot;\">battled to a 2-2 draw</a> with Argentina.</p> <p><strong>Bei-watch</strong> </p> <p>Softball has been dropped from the London 2012 Olympics, but US catcher Stacey Nuveman is pleading with the IOC to think of the kids and bring it back. \"We're not the only ones grieving,\" she weeped. \"There are little girls in Australia and Japan and Chinese Taipei who are devastated also.\" The fact that in 2004 the US won all their nine games, outscoring their opponents 51-1, has nothing to do with it of course.</p> <p>Yesterday India won their first individual gold medal ever when Abhinav Bindra, who trains on an air-conditioned range in his backyard with \"an international standard transportation system\" - as you do - took gold in the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <p>However our favourite shooting story of the Games involves the 10m air pistol champ Pang Wei. According to the China Daily: \"As a child, the quiet rookie always had a thing for guns. He would collect all kinds of guns ... and one day when a neighbour jokingly asked him to try his hand at shooting, he immediately took to the idea.\" When Pang's grandmother was interviewed after his medal she admitted: \"This kid was strange. Shooting did for him what books couldn't.\"</p> <p>The first couple of Chinese sport, badminton players Lin Dan and Xie Xingfang, have both opened their singles campaigns. The two lovers have decided to temporarily separate while the Olympics is going on, but there was not much sign of it yesterday: both were playing at the same time on courts almost alongside each other. And spookily, both games started and finished at exactly the same time.</p> <p>There is much merchandising tat to be made and flogged in Beijing, but one company's products have backfired. A line of skimpy women's panties featuring the Olympic mascots has provoked public outrage in Beijing for insulting \"the blessed image of the Fuwa\".</p> <p>Finally, while the Olympics may have cost China in excess of $50bn US dollars, Sun Weide of the Beijing organising committee insists that \"frugality is one of the guiding principles\" of these Games.

  "<p>In the ninth of her <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/allotment/2008/06/post_7.html\">cookery series</a> for these pages, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/closeup-claire-ptak-765195.html\">Claire Ptak</a>, queen of the delicious <a href=\"http://www.violetcakes.com/\">Violet cupcake</a>, relives her salad days on a dude ranch.</p> <p></p> <p>I have had a hankering lately for cornbread. Laid out on a blue and white checked tablecloth on the beach; a large square wedged alongside a bowl of spicy chili bursting with tender beans; crumbly cubes piled high in a basket, with a plate of hot fried chicken and collard greens. Then there is cornbread-as-breakfast, buttered, with a cup of black coffee.</p> <p>I spent four summers from the age of 18 working as the baker of the HF Bar dude ranch situated at the base of the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming. One of my oldest friends, Lazuli, had spent a summer working there in 1992 and was so enthusiastic about it that I signed up for it the following year, sight unseen. </p> <p>About 40 of us spent the hot Wyoming summer cooking in the sprawling ranch house kitchen, cleaning cabins, keeping the grounds, instructing fly-fishing and shooting, and/or wrangling horses. We worked tirelessly throughout the days, but the nights were ours to sit out near Salt Creek with our cowboy booted-feet up, drinking beer and stoking the fires of summer romance. </p> <p>It was, and still is, run by a fantastic woman called Margi Schroth who looked after all of us, but left us alone. As long as we were at work in the morning, we could dance all night. There was a ranch newsletter published every morning. On the back was printed that evening's menu. Cornbread with fresh corn kernels was a favourite after a long and dusty horseback ride. Unfortunately, I don't have my old recipes from the ranch here in London. They are packed away, deep in my parent's shed. So I phoned my mom to get her recipe, which I remembered being equally as delicious. I have added roasted chilies to the bread, as I used to do on the ranch.</p> <p>I cycled up the road to my Turkish greengrocer yesterday to get fresh sweet corn and some cornmeal to finally satisfy my craving. As I was paying, a woman walked into the shop and asked, believe it or not, if they sold cornbread. 'I'm about to go make some!' I exclaimed. 'I wouldn't even know where to begin,' she said. It was an omen.</p> <p>Cornbread with fresh sweet corn kernels</p> <p>Many will tell you that cornbread has to be baked in a cast iron skillet. This method does yield a wonderfully tender bread with crispy brown edges, but if you don't have one don't be deterred. I baked mine in an enamel roasting dish.</p> <p>3 tablespoons/40g unsalted butter for the baking dish</p> <p>420ml/2 cups milk</p> <p>3 eggs</p> <p>60g/2 fl oz melted butter or oil</p> <p>The kernels of 2 ears of corn, cut from the cob</p> <p>3 red or green chilies (optional)</p> <p>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p> <p>3 teaspoons caster sugar</p> <p>1 teaspoon sea salt</p> <p>180g/1 1/4 cup yellow corn meal</p> <p>70g/ 1/2 cup/strong (bread) flour or plain flour</p> <p>Heat the oven to 220\u00b0C /450\u00b0F</p> <p>Cut the 3 tablespoons (40g) of butter into a medium-sized roasting tin and set aside.</p> <p>In a large bowl, whisk together your milk, eggs, and melted butter or oil. To this, add your corn kernels. If you want to use the chilies, I suggest roasting them over the flame of your cooker to blacken the skins. The smoky flavour really enhances the cornbread. Once roasted, seed and de-vein them and dice. Add to milk mixture. </p> <p>In a separate bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and mix up well. Now add the dry to the wet and stir just until combined. Do not overmix, or you will have tough, dry cornbread.</p> <p>Now place your tin with the butter (or oil) in it, into the oven. Once the butter has melted (a minute or so) pull the tin back out of the oven and immediately pour in the batter and return to the oven. Bake about 25 minutes, or until golden and pulling away from the sides of the tin.</p>",
  "<p>We Conservatives need to show that we are <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dad0528c-6707-11dd-808f-0000779fd18c.html\">up to the task</a> of rescuing this country's economy from the damage being done by current policies. The popular mood has shifted decisively against this government as a result of the revelation that far from offering economic success based on prudence, this government has been offering an economic mess based on too much borrowing. All this government wants to do now is to spend money it does not have \u2013 \u00a33bn last week on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/creditcrunch.northernrock\">new equity</a> for Northern Rock, a business which should be returned promptly to the private sector while there is still something left.</p> <p>The Conservatives are in a good position to do just this. The central economic tenet of the leadership has been to say they will share the proceeds of economic growth between tax reductions and better public services. They have said, as Mr Blair said but did not do, that extra public money alone is not sufficient to give us the hospitals and schools we need. Reform is also needed, a system which allows more choice and local initiative and spends less on top down requirements, audit, surveillance and instruction. They have said welfare needs reform to place the accent on finding more jobs for more people to get them off benefit.</p> <p>These three central tenets of modern Conservatism are central to bringing about economic recovery after the damaging credit crunch. We need to seek more value for every public pound spent. We need to concentrate the extra public money on schools and hospitals, not on broken banks, ID cards and hand outs. We need to relieve the burden of taxation when we can where it does most damage. High taxes are fuelling price rises, and cutting new investment and the creation of new jobs.</p> <p>Judging by current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">opinion polls</a> the present leadership has persuaded many voters of the need for change. To persuade them to vote this way in a general election, and to show them we mean business, the leadership can and will flesh out more of the detail of how these three main propositions will be applied to a broken society and a broken economy. We will have to explain how we cannot allow government to carry on living on tick on the huge scale of this current regime. We can show how if you avoided nationalising Northern Rock, avoided excess enthusiasm for wildly expensive centralised computerisation schemes, and keep better control over the numbers of quangos and administrative staff you could start to right the listing UK government ship now in such heavy waters.</p>",
  "<p>Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan stands virtually alone today while facing the most serious challenge to his presidency: possible <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/11/pakistan.musharraf/?iref=mpstoryview\">impeachment</a> by the new democratically-elected government. </p> <p>The potential charges are serious: conspiring to destabilise the government that was elected last February, unlawfully removing the country's top judges in November 2007, and failing to provide adequate security to Benazir Bhutto before her assassination last December. Allying himself with the Bush administration has increased his unpopularity, especially following <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKISL22167020080728\">missile attacks</a> by the US in Pakistan's tribal areas.</p> <p>Despite earlier differences over how to deal with Musharraf, Pakistan's leading political parties are now united against him. Feuding between the Pakistan People's party, led by Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, and the Pakistan Muslim League (N), led by Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister, had given Musharraf a chance to regain some standing after his allies were defeated in the February elections. American reluctance to abandon Musharraf \u2013 together with prolonged electricity shortages, which made the new government appear incompetent \u2013 also raised his hopes.</p> <p>Musharraf may be counting on the army, his primary constituency, to bail him out of this crisis. Though such support remains a possibility, it is unlikely that the army leadership will extend itself on his behalf.</p> <p>Though a protege of Musharraf, the army's chief of staff, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7024719.stm\">General Ashfaq Kayani</a>, is a professional soldier for whom the army's institutional interests are more important than the political interests of his former army boss. Kayani has repeatedly declared that the army will not interfere in political affairs, and that the parliament and constitution are supreme.</p> <p>Even if the army is tempted to step in on Musharraf's behalf, it has been chastened by political developments during the past year. The entire <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/06/09/pakistan.lawyers/index.html\">legal community</a> arose to demand restoration of the country's judges and reinforcement of the rule of law. The public's demand for free elections and the resulting creation of a democratic government have forced the military to accept the public will.</p> <p>The army has also paid a heavy price for Musharraf's approach to the war on terror. Suicide bombers have struck repeatedly at military installations and personnel around the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi. An increase in deadly attacks on army convoys in the Pakistan-Afghanistan tribal areas has also pushed the army away from Musharraf.</p> <p>Though the army has reaped a financial windfall from US military aid, and has targeted many foreign militants allied with al-Qaida in the region, its performance against Pakistani militants has been mixed at best. Consequently, the prestige of the Taliban and other militant groups operating in the area has grown. In this context, the army, seeking to avoid sole responsibility for reverses, wants a popular government to take charge of policy. No such government can emerge if the elected parties are unseated. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there are signs of disagreement on important matters between the government and the army. The military recently blocked a government move to place Pakistan's infamous intelligence service, the ISI, under the control of the interior minister rather than the prime minister. Musharraf backed the military's opposition to this reform, gaining some gratitude from military commanders.</p> <p>During PM Yousaf Raza Gilani's recent visit to the US, President Bush repeatedly said that his administration supports Pakistan's democracy, a policy since reiterated by US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. This indicates that the US will not back Musharraf in any confrontation between him and Pakistan's democratic forces. Most Pakistanis hope so.</p> <p>Musharraf must assess what will be his legacy. Rather than trying to face down impeachment and prolonging the crisis, he should recognise that Pakistan cannot afford more instability, and that giving up honourably will bring him some respect. </p> <p>For the sake of argument, even if Musharraf faces impeachment and by some stroke of luck is saved from being thrown out of office, his future will be bleak. In March 2009, the current ruling coalition will gain more seats in the Senate, and the government would almost certainly try to impeach him again. </p> <p>Moreover, any attempt by Musharraf to dislodge the government by using his constitutional authority would trigger another election, the results of which would not be much different from the vote in February. It is time for Musharraf's friends in the west to press him to serve his country one last time, by avoiding confrontation with his country's democratic forces and calling it quits. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

  "<p>Olympic organisers admitted today that they are using volunteers to fill swathes of empty seats at competition venues as concerns grow at the failure of ticket holders to attend events.</p> <p>Despite claims from the Beijing organising committee (Bocog) that all 6.8m tickets for the Games have been sold and confident predictions of full houses at every event, the first three days of competition have seen spaces available at most venues.</p> <p>There have also been large numbers of yellow-shirted \"cheerleaders\" present at some events, recruited to create an atmosphere and to prevent the embarrassing spectacle of empty seats appearing on television.</p> <p>At the Capital Gymnasium earlier this week there were three blocks of several hundred yellow-shirted spectators cheering loudly for Venezuela as they took on the USA at volleyball.</p> <p>Yesterday, organisers claimed that the cheerleaders were in fact spectators, but today Wang Wei, vice-president of Bocog, conceded that they had been recruited by venue managers to fill seats.</p> <p>\"We are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia,\" he said. \"We think it is due to the weather, the humidity and then the rain, and on the first couple of days there were not many spectators who showed up.\" </p> <p>\"There are also reserved seats for the Olympic family that have not been taken up, the preliminary rounds are sometimes not attended, and people at other events have tickets for the whole day and do not attend the every event.</p> <p>\"If local venue managers find there are not enough people in the venue or too many empty seats they arrange for local volunteers as cheerleaders, and they are told to cheer for both teams to create a better atmosphere. If the ticket-holders turn up then they get up and go.\"</p> <p>The vast majority of tickets have been sold to Chinese nationals but despite the assurances of the organisers Olympic enthusiasm has not tempted them all to take up their seats. Ticket touts have also been operating despite it being illegal under Chinese law.</p> <p>Bocog's problems are compounded by the situation at the Olympic Green and the main park, which has been sparsely attended because only ticket holders can get access. Beijing residents without tickets can be seen walking around the perimeter of the heavily secured site attempting to get a glimpse of the Bird's Nest stadium and the Water Cube.</p> <p>The situation is understood to have angered some IOC sponsors, whose expensively-erected exhibition pavilions have been deserted. Wang Wei said that Bocog would act to admit more people. \"Yesterday we saw that there were not enough people in the Olympic Green, and we encourage more people to come. Local communities can apply for tickets, and people from around China can come through travel agents.\"</p>",

Silver to South Korea's Park Tae-hwan and bronze to the American Peter Vanderkaay.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.20am: Team GB Swimming</strong> Gemma Spofforth is in lane two for the 100m backstroke final. She'll do well to keep up with Zimbabwe's Kirtsty Coventry and the American former world record holder Natalie Coughlin.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.27am:</strong> Coughlin wins it.

She'll now have to wait to see if she makes the repechage.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>5.44am: </strong><strong>Gymnastics</strong> It's an emotional one. China have clinched a <strong>gold</strong> medal in the men's team gymnastics. The crowd go wild, Matt Baker's voice goes sky high, and one Chinese gymnast breaks down in tears. Japan were second, and the USA third. Phew...</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>5.48am: </strong> It's almost 6.00am BST and i need help with something that's been vexing me all day.

I missed the result of the Men's 50m Pistol Final. It was <strong>gold</strong> for Jong Oh Jin.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>5.54am: </strong><strong>Badminton</strong> Yet more bad news as mixed doubles pair Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg crash out 21-15 21-8 to the number three seeds from China, He Hanbin and Yu Yang. The commentator complained about a 'partisan crowd' but i can't imagine an audience of boozed-up Brits clapping for a plucky Chinese athlete in 2012.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>5.58am: </strong><strong>Shooting</strong> Richard Faulds is through to the double trap final, qualifying in fifth place. Can the man who won gold in Sydney, do it again? Hmm...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.01am: </strong> Things appear to have quietened down, so if you've just joined us. <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.michaelphelps\">Michael Phelps</a> won his third gold medal but it was a mixed bag for <a href=\"http://http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics3\">GB's swimmers</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.10am: </strong> An anecdote from David Brigden, the punch line of which is a Chinese football commentator saying he'll eat his teeth if China beat Brazil in the football. a strange expression, i'll grant you, but don't us Brits say \"i'll eat my hat\"?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.16am: </strong> The Beeb are talking beer at six in the morning, personally i'd settle for a nice cup of Lapsang souchong.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.19am: </strong>Greg Webster you are indeed correct, and you have forced me to hang my head in shame. Richard Faulds did not win gold four years ago, he won it in Sydney in 2000. In Athens he was thirteenth.t</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.22am: </strong> Altering the kayaking seems to be the order of the day. Tim in Hong Kong suggests: \"Leeches, strange water-born tropical diseases with no known cure... and Piranhas.\" All well and good, but I need everyone working to find out the total number of gold medals on offer. Ofcourse I could probably click and find out for myself...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>6.25am: </strong><strong>Basketball</strong> Croatia are now joint top of Group A after beating Russia 85-78.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6.29am: </strong><strong>Judo</strong> At last! Some good news. Euan Burton has beaten Argentina's Emmanuel Lucenti in the under-81kg category.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>6.33am: </strong>Ray in Oz i could kiss you. He informs me that: \"There are 302 gold medals up for grabs, 47 in athletics and 34 in swimming.\" That's a lot of precious metal.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>6.36am: </strong><strong>Sailing </strong>A beautiful show of comradery from those hard working men and women in the armed forces. Amelia and James Gould want to wish Penny Clark good luck in the Laser Radials class.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>6.43am:</strong><strong> Tennis </strong>Another great result for the all-conquering Williams sisters. Venus joins her sister Serena in the third. She defeated Iveta Benesova 6-1 6-4.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>6.46am: </strong>According to Steve Newman: \"Australia like to compare medals as a proportion of population. Thus USA and China do not do quite as well.\" Interesting...so who is the best nation using that calculation?</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>6.50am: </strong><strong>Sailing</strong> Penny Clark isn't the only Brit in action, Paul Goodison is going for gold in the <strong>men's laser</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>6.53am: </strong><strong>Rishi watch</strong> may have come to an end but Matt Baker has sprinted into the BBC studio to entertain us. Baker and Adrian Chiles are acting like a couple of old school friends who've met up for a drink, with Hazel Irvine sitting awkwardly in the corner.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.01am: </strong>Xan Perez Perez has suggested a doping medals table. If that was the case Spain would be winning after cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno tested positive for EPO and was thrown out.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>7.05am: </strong><strong>Athletics </strong>All hail the great lady. Paula Radcliffe has confirmed that she will be competing in the marathon.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>7.09am: </strong><strong>Water polo </strong>I haven't written enough about this sport. Anyway the USA beat Italy 12-11. It sounded like an absolute nail biter.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>7.15am: </strong>Andrew Jolly is either an Olympic hero or a bit of a saddo as he's started a spreadsheet to work out medals in proportion to population. Unfortunately 'work' has gotten in the way of completion but he's predicting that Chinese Taipai would come out on top. Readers will have to wait until tomorrow, when it's his day off, for the official results so far.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7.21am: </strong>More results from other assorted sports. In <strong>men's handball</strong> Croatia beat Brazil 33-14 and Russia edged out Egypt 28-27. Two other <strong>water polo</strong> results Montenegro 12-0 Canada and Spain 9-8 Australia. and for all those who missed the <strong>softball</strong> CANADA 6- 1 CHINESE TAIPEI.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>7.27am: </strong>It's official (well official in my eyes anyway) so far the best nation, in terms of population to medals ratio is...<em>drum roll</em>...Finland. Stuff your Chinas and your Americas, the Finns are currently the team to beat.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>7.30am: </strong>Some more ever-so-subtle plugging.

Timour has kindly pointed out to me that we now have proof that a game between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/12/olympics2008?picture=336471053\">Canada and Chinese Taipei actually took place</a>.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>7.44am: </strong>Richard Greaves thinks we shouldn't stop at population: \"You could look at success in relation to team size, country land area or any of a multitude of other social indicators - percentage of teenage obesity, average daily calorie intake, average cost of living. The problem is I'm still racking my brains trying to think of one that would put Team GB at the top of the table?\" But surely we'd be in the top two for calorie intake?</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.48am: </strong><strong>Diving</strong> After yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics1\">Daley-gate</a> can the British women do any better? Tonia Couch and Stacie Powell are currently seventh in the 10m synchro final.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>7.52am: </strong>Read our latest in-depth coverage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.paularadcliffe\">Paula Radcliffe</a>, who has admitted she won't be 100 per cent fit for the marathon but will still race.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>7.58am: </strong><strong>Judo</strong> Euan Burton has won again, great stuff, he beat Safouane Attaf of Morocco. And that's all you're going to get from me folks, I'm passing the torch on to Robin Lynch, so direct all your irreverent banter his way. It's been a pleasure, until next time...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Morning all. </strong>Coming up over the next couple of hours on Britwatch: Richard Faulds and Steve Scott in the men's double trap shooting; Campbell Walsh in the men's canoe slalom; Euan Burton in the men's judo; and of course Tonia Couch and Stacie Powell are competing at the moment in the 10m synchronised diving. They seem to be recovering from a shaky start.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.03am</strong> But the Beeb don't care about any of that, Adrian Chiles is currently discussing the accoustics of various auditoria with one of the world's greatest pianists.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.05am</strong> Objectivity corner: We couldn't keep sympathising with all those British ex-pats who are suffering from biased TV coverage in their resident countries and do the same ourselves, so also coming up soon: handball and volleyball.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.12am</strong> Britain's Euan Burton has made the last 16 of the men's judo under-82kg category. He's closing in on the quarters.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.15</strong>Euan Burton, a genuine medal hope for Team GB, is through to the quarter-finals of the men's judo -81kg</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p>My judo knowledge is not what it used to be, but according to the BBC's main in the field, Burton's progress has been solid but unspectacular so far.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.18</strong> Couch and Powell are up to sixth with two rounds to go. It will need a career-defining performance to get into the medals from here, but they have a chance.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.20</strong> Burton hails from Edinburgh and there's another Scotsman in action for Britain now in the canoe slalom. It's David Florence from Aberdeenshire, and he's in the semi-final.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.24</strong>Team GB's divers are up to fifth now. Could they? Can they? I'm not even British and I'm beside myself with excitement. And David Florence is in the final of the canoe slalom.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.28</strong> It's the Gary Naylor of the daytime MBM: Gary Naylor. \"While we're reworking the Medals table to account for population / GDP / Human Rights rating etc, can we do a table for the Eurovision Song Contest? I'm happy to concede first place to Ireland in exchange for the joy of seeing France undoubtedly rock bottom. They may have the food, Queen Carla and unwatchably complex films, but they can't do pop music.\" What? Clearly you are too young to remember Vanessa Paradis' peerless Joe Le Taxi, Gary.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.30</strong> Softball update: The US has beaten Venezuela 11-0. In fact they stopped the game after the fifth innings, such was the Americans' dominance. I bet Derby County must have wished such a rule was in place for last year's Premier League.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.32</strong> China's Wang Xin and Chen Ruolin have won the Olympic gold medal in the women's 10m platform synchronised diving. Australia's Melissa Wu and Briony Cole won the silver and Mexico's Paola Espinosa and Tatiana Ortiz the bronze. Drat.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>8.33am</strong> If you're British and particularly patriotic, look away now: Powell and Couch finished last. Double drat. Not a great couple of days for British diving.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>8.35am</strong> I've just received an email from Kelvin McKenzie, former editor of one of our downmarket rivals, all-round nice guy and the brains behind \"Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster.\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>8.36am</strong> Except it's not him at all, it's Jimmy Shaker from Aberdeen, who I suspect has been using a pseudonym to attract my attention. Jimmy, the flaw in your plan was spelling Kelvin's name wrong. Anyway, Jimmy's from Aberdeen and he's thrilled to bits for local boy David Florence.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>8.40am</strong> Judo: Euan Burton has lost his quarter-final to Athens silver-medallist Roman Gontiuk by waza-ari. But since the Ukrainian is now through to the semi-finals Burtonstill has a second chance in the repechage.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>8.41am</strong> Richard Faulds has reached the final of the men's double-trap. Huzzah! Come on Fauldsy! But we kind of expected that.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>8.47am</strong> And it's back down to earth with a crash for shooting fans. Richard Faulds has finished sixth. The pesky Americans have taken gold. It's Walton Eller with 190 points, followed by Italy's Francesco D'Aniello with 187 and Hu Binyuan (China) with 184.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>8.50am </strong>Latest medal table: China in forst with 11 golds, 3 silvers 4 bronzes followed by the US, south Korea, Italy, Australia, Japan and then Britain in seventh with two golds and a bronze. Team GB need two more golds to overtake the Aussies. Which is the whole point, right?</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>8.53</strong> Bruce Jackson takes me to task: \"Hang on. Hang on. Just because we 'kind of expected' this Faulds chap to make the final doesn't mean it isn't good. Who is he anyway?\" Where is your unrealistic sense of expectation, Bruce? Faulds won gold in Sydney, so I guess we were hoping for better than sixth. Although that was eight years ago.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>8.56am</strong> Wiping a tear from his eye while binning his 'Come on Fauldsy!\" Sign and collection of mini Union Flags, Greg Webster wants to know what other chances Britain have today for a medal.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>9.0am</strong> Well Greg, it's not looking good for Joe Murray, who has lost comprehensively to China's Gu Yu in the round of 32.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>9.05am</strong> But we have high hopes for the women's equestrian eventing team and William Fox-Pitt in the individual eventing. He went to Eton, you know. That'll be later this afternoon, from Hong Kong.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>9.06am</strong> That boxing score was 17-7 to Gu Yu. Murray was expected to progress much further than the first round, so that's a blow for him and a blow for Tema GB. Hard luck young man, well done for getting this far, etc and so on. And it's that man Bruce Jackson again: \"Ah ha! \"Eight years ago\". Eight years ago I could see well enough to attach a hook to the finest of fishing lines. These days I have to wear a couple of bottle ends on my nose just to type this drivel. We're lucky this Faulds bloke isn't being charged with murder after blasting holes in half the other competitors. I reckon he's done OK.\" In fact Richard made a promising start before missing both of his final shots.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>9.07am</strong> Canoeing update: Campbell Walsh, a silver medallist and current European champion, will progress no further at these Games. If your spirits are flagging hearing about Brits tumbling out, read <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/12/why_the_pool_is_way_too_fast_f.html\">Robert Kitson's</a> piece on why so many swimming records are falling.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>9.12am </strong>Steve George informs me it's all kicking off at the badminton....</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>9.16am</strong> For the uninitiated, Steve George is the only Englisher in his office in China. I'll keep you updated with the badminton soon. For now, Al Parkes is standing up and claiming sport.theguardian.com to a scrap in the playground after school. </p> <p>\"Presumably Robin, you get your medals info from the BBC online medal table, as the cacky Guardian one is still showing G10 for China... Still, it took it about 4 hours to put on our swimming medals yesterday, so there's still plenty of time...\"</p> <p>Ouch. Cacky? <em>Cacky? </em></p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>9.25am</strong> David Florence has finished fourth in his semi-final of the men's singles C1 slalom and has thus qualified for the final. The times from the qualifiers are carried forward to the final, so good chance of a medal for David.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> Ahead of David are Michal Martikan of Slovakia, Stanislav Jezek of Czech Republic and Krzysztof Bieryt of Poland. And lurking just behind in fifth place? Robin Bell of Australia</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>9.31am</strong> Part-time MBMer Steve George reports from the badminton court, where Team GB (whoop whoop!) are taking on China (boo!) in the mixed doubles: \"It's all in Chinese... Needless to say, China are winning, one/10 - 0/5 or although I'm sure it's more complex than that... In truth i was kind of hoping you'd explain it to me.... I mean badminton? I've just got to grips with tennis.\"</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>9.37am</strong> Head-scratching corner: If you've been watching the Games and wondering why so many of the venues are only half-full, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/emptyseats\">Paul Kelso</a> is the man to ask. Read, as they say, all about it.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>9.38am </strong> Great news for Euan Burton, who has won his first bout in the -81kg judo repechage, meaning he is still on course for a bronze, but can't make the gold or silver positions. And, as promised, some neutral news: Hungary have smashed Greece in the water polo.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>9.42am</strong> \"You haven't yet mentioned the rowing,\" says Joanne Harris. I have not Joanne, I was on my way there until I was interrupted by the big story from the water polo. </p> <p> \"The women's lightweight double of Helen Casey and Hester Goodsell just qualified for the semi-finals by winning their repechage - they have a good chance of qualifying for the final from Thursday's semi. Not, of course, that I managed to watch it. Here in NZ TVNZ has shown beach volleyball (no Kiwis, no Brits), badminton (ditto), and now the women's synchro diving (Brits, hurrah, but I already know the result!)\" Sorry for ruining that one for you, Joanne. I'll try to get behind the times in future.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>9.46am </strong>None of my trusty news sources will tell me <em>anything</em> about the badminton, so I am blessed to have Steve George on the case. Except it's not good news. Britain have lost to China in the mixed doubles. Grrr!</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>9.50am</strong> Handbags at dawn corner: Kyle Hauptman says that although Jessica from Connecticut (see 4.32am) is partly correct in saying that the US media tally the medal count by overall medals rather than just gold, this has always been the case. Even during the Cold War. So there.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>9.51am</strong> Why are you Americans at work anyway? Isn't in three in the morning?</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>9.52am</strong> Trouble at mill: Team GB's head boxing coach Terry Edwards reckons the Chinese judges didn't give his lad Joe Murray a fair go. </p> <p>\"I thought they were very generous to the Chinese,\" he said. \"You expect a slight bias but you come to the Olympic Games and expect a level playing field. Joe didn't box the best I've seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring. Everything the Chinese guy touched, they pressed the button for him.\"</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>9.54am </strong>In the interests of impartiality, I can't comment either way but I will agree with Terry that the scoring does indeed make a difference.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>9.55am</strong> Euan Burton must win two more fights to claim bronze. His next bout in the men's under-81kg judo will be against Brazil's 2007 world champion - and pre-tournament favourite - Tiago Camilo. Big challenge for Euan, then.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>9.57am </strong>David Florence is <em>storming</em> it in the canoe slalom final. Come on David!</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>9.58am</strong> Florence is in first place with 178.61secs. Three more competitors to go.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>10.02am</strong> David Florence is guaranteed a medal now.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>10.03am</strong> After Poland's Bieryt came in 18 seconds behind Florence, the Czech Republic's Jesek is struggling. He's just finished and moved into fourth place.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>10.04am</strong> One more to go. It's Martikan of Slovakia. Hold on to your hats....</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>10.05am</strong> He's ahead of Florence at the moment. Silver for David?</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>10.06am Silver medal for Team GB!! </strong> David Florence has taken silver in the men's C1 canoe slalom after a brilliant display in the final lifted him from fourth to second.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>10.09am</strong> Slovakian Michael Martikan, the leader from the semis, finished in 176.65secs. Florence came in just behind on 178.61 and Australia's Robin Bell took bronze on 180.59. Well done David! High fives and fist pumps at the theguardian.com sports desk</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>10.13am</strong> If you thought was exciting, get a load of this. Togo are looking good for their first ever medal. Benjamin Boukpeti has just qualified first in the men's K1 canoe slalom. Yowzah. Ten points and a smug grin for whoever can tell me Togo's capital, so I can use the phrase \"They'll be celebrating in ... tonight.\"</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>10.26am</strong> Italian archer Francesco Aniello is on his knees sobbing uncontrollably. We're not sure if he's happy or sad...he's happy. It's silver for Fran. Get a hold of yourself, man. You're an archer. Where's the Agincourt spirit these days?</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>10.28am</strong> Dunstan Bentley has been disqualified from the super-mega Togo capital competition, and made to go stand in the corner for the rest of class. He had originally taken all ten points with Lome - the correct answer - but a steward's inquiry revealed Dunstan to be an employee of a well-known travel guide company. One of the posher ones. Shame!</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>10.30am</strong> British sailing news: <strong>Paul Goodison</strong> had a mixed day, struggling home 15th in his first race of the laser class early this morning before picking himself up for second place in race two. He stands at sixth place overall nd must hope Good Paul comes out tomorrow and Bad Paul stays in the Olympic Village. </p> <p>Goodison just missed out on a medal in Athens so must be desperate to avoid a similar result this time around. He has 17 points from his two races, 10 behind New Zealand's Andrew Murdoch who leads the standings after placing second and fifth in his first two races.</p> <p>Britain's <strong>Penny Clark</strong>, meanwhile, ended the day in ninth after a disappointing 22nd place in race two.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>10.37am</strong> Daniel McKay-Smith joins Dunstan in the corner after supplying me with the capital of Tonga</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>10.38am</strong> Bronze for Togo! Benjamin Boukpeti has just smashed his paddle after taking third in the K1 men's kayak, but more importantly he has become the first Togolese to win an Olympic medal. They'll be whooping it up in Lome tonight.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>10.45am</strong> More handbags: Dean Anderson wants a piece of me <em>and </em>Dunstan Bentley: \"You're being a bit unfair on Dunstan Bentley aren't you? You just said to tell you the answer, not that there were terms and conditions. So he's being excluded for being correct - isn't knowing the answer sort of essential for entry?

The Americans have tonked everyone else to take gold in the men's eights repechage, but only after pulling away at the end from the Netherlands and Australia. Rowing must easily be one of the most exciting spectator events at the Games. Shame you lot missed it.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> Reflections on David Florence: the gold medal winner, Michael Martikan is a four-time world champion and also won gold in Atlanta, silver in Sydney and silver in Athens. So that's quite a lot of medals, really. And Florence, who was sitting outside the medal positions going into the final, pushed Martikan very close. <em>And</em> he's only 26, so good chance of success in London in four years time.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>11.11am</strong> The US team's victory in the rowing means they, Australia and the Netherlands will make men's eight final, where they will meet <strong>Team GB</strong>, world champions Canada and Poland.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>11.41</strong> I cannot believe is has taken almost an hour for someone to point out that the Italy is neither England nor France.</p> <p>Simon Martin bleats: \"I did your actual history degree and I am fairly sure that the Italians weren't big players at Agincourt.

A reminder for those who have joined us late: Burton is a Scott(British - theguardian.com Stiff Upper Lip Ed) judoka competing in the men's under-81 repechage, where he can only win the bronze.</p> <p>Tom Phillips points out: \"Agincourt might well be the only famous archery-related battle anybody can think of. But given that Francesco D'Aniello was weeping and flailing around on the floor because he'd just won a silver in the shooting, I'm not entirely clear why we needed to think of archery metaphors at all...\"</p> <p>Well, he's still a crybaby. In fact now he's a crybaby with a gun.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>11.28am </strong> Burton is out, having been soundly beaten by the 2007 world champion Tiago Camilo. Gah!</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>11.38am </strong>Spain and China have moved into extra time in their basketball match. Which is important because of this bizarre incident, when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsbasketball.olympics20081\">Spanish</a> team made slit-eyed gestures for a promotional photograph before the Games. Because what Spanish sport really needs is another racial row. Updates on that match soon.</p> <p>I was felling a bit guilty about unnecessary jibes against the dastardly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympicgames.aquatics.britainaustralia\">Aussies</a>, but not any more. One of their chaps has said that Britishers have an aversion to soap.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>11.39am</strong> Spain win! 85-75.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>11.48</strong> In the badminton, Britain's Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms are taking on - and beating -the Chinese mixed doubles pair. It's currently 9-5. I realise I <em>may</em> have reported that game as being over already. Let's just forget about that, shall we? I blame Steve George. Who has suddenly gone silent on the matter...</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.02pm</strong> Sorry folks, <strong>technical issues</strong>. We're back now though.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.05pm</strong> After the Steve George shambles, I am loth to report on the badminton unless I can actually see it happening, and the BBC have switched to covering the Russia/Georgia conflict, so I'll have to get back to you on that one. The Brits were winning last time I checked.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.07pm </strong>I compel you all to ignore these ramblings at once and go read <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/12/aberdeen_and_togo_triumph_in_t.html\">Andy Bull's</a> report on David Florence's silver for Britain and Benjamin Boukpeti's bronze - Togo's first ever Olympic medal. But do come back when you're finished, won't you?</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>12.12pm </strong> Japan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.paularadcliffe1\">Mizuki Noguchi,</a> who is one of Paula Radcliffe's rivals for the marathon has withdrawn due to injury, boosting our girl's chances. But Radcliffe has injury problems of her own. For all those slug-a-beds who weren't here at 8.13am, here is the latest report on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.paularadcliffe\">Paula's</a> fitness</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.14pm </strong>Right, badminton. It's 11-7 in the second game to Britain, who took the first game. This is a real battling performance - the Chinese were hot favourites before the match.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.19pm</strong> The Chinese take it back to just two points between them...and now it's only one. 12-11. China serving.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.22pm</strong> AAAAAARGH. Gao Ling and Zheng Bo win five points in a row to take the lead, 13-12. But now Britain have taken back the serve. Tip for newcomers to badminton: you can only score points on your own serve.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.24pm</strong> Brilliant defense fro the irrepressible Emms, but China keep coming and it's now</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>12.27pm </strong>Apologies for technical hitches; that sentence should have finished....</p> <p>19-16 to china.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>12.29pm</strong> Apparently, says Russell Herbert: \"Badminton scoring has changed you can score points on either serve now, only thing that changes hands is the serve, also its up to 21 now not 15 as in the previous olympics.\"</p> <p>I last played in 1993, so that explains that.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>12.33pm </strong>A-ha! Joe Milton was kind enough to step and save my blushes. There was an earlier game as well between China and Britain, which Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg lost to Hanbin He and Yang Yu, 21-15, 21-8. So I feel less stupid now. But not much. After all, it was posted on our own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/badminton.clarke.kellogg\">website</a>.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>12.34pm </strong>Anyway, it's currently 4-3 to Britain in the deciding game.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>12.36pm</strong> China take the initiative. It's now 9-5.</p> <p>Down in Hong Kong (which is what I would say if I was in Beijing and not crummy old London), the eventing has started. Britain's medal hopes here are the women's team, currently in bronze position, and Mary King for the women's individual. She is currently fifth. In the men's individual eventing William, Fox and Pitt are the words to scrawl on your homemade poster.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>12.43pm</strong> It's slipping away from Emms and Robertson. Nathan has just seen what he must have thought was a certain point saved by the Chinese and it's now 7-12.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>12.48pm </strong>I should point out that in eventing, men and women compete on equal footing, as several of you have been quick to remind me. Clare Storrow was particularly withering. Ouch.</p> <p>It's 16-12 to China in the badminton.</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>12.52pm</strong> Britain win three points on a row, with Emms leading the comeback. Now it's back to one point!</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>12.54pm </strong>Robertson smashes it straight at Gao Ling to take Britain ahead. The crowd voice their displeasure. China have now lost seven points in a row.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>12.56pm</strong> Gail Emms crashes the shuttlecock into the net, when she really should have replied easily. That leaves it at 19-19, but now it's Zheng's turn to make a mistake ... THEY'VE DONE IT!</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>12.57pm</strong> My excited tone may have given you the impression that this was the final; in fact Emms and Robertson have just reached the quarter-final. But it really was the most thrilling match and a great achievement from the British pair. They won nine out of the last 11 points to take the final game 21-19.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>1.20</strong> Quick update for those of you who don't know much about <strong>eventing</strong> (a group which clearly includes myself). There are three days of competition; dressage, cross country and show jumping. Germany are ahead coming into the final day, with Australia (boo! hiss!) second and Blighty third.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>1.32pm</strong> There are also individual medals and Britain's Mary King is in the running, currently in fifth place. Germany also lead the individual table but it's close at the top between Hinrich Romeke and his colleague Ingrid Klimke in second.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>1.39pm</strong> It's eventing from here on in folks, but Team GB are gunning for the podium, so stay tuned.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you want to read a report of Britain's badminton mixed doubles win that was written in a sober, reflective manner by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicsbadminton\">Les Roopanarine</a>, here it is. For over-excited twitterings, scroll down.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>1.43pm</strong> A disappointing round for Britain's Daisy Dick, who picks up eight jumping faults and three time.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>1.46 </strong> Australia's Sonia Johnson goes round with no penalties. good news for her, not so hot for Britain. It's Frank Ostholt up now for Germany.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>1.48</strong> Ostholt responds with a clear as well and is followed by New Zeland's Mark Todd, something of a legend in equestrian circles. He picks up one penalty point at the end but could still make the individual final.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>2.00pm</strong> At the moment it's looking like Britain will be scrapping for bronze rather than challenging Germany or Australia for the top two positions.</p> <p>New Zealand's Caroline Powell clocks up 73.20 with four penalties and that leaves their team on 289.60 with one to go, Joe Meyer.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>2.02pm</strong> While Australia and Germany are pulling away, Britain's nearest rivals below them are slipping away below them too. It's a disappointing round for Italy's Susanna Bordone who finishes on 94.46.</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>2.04pm</strong> Clear for <strong>Britain's Tina Cook!</strong> Fantastic! 57.40 and she now lies second. The leaders are all still top run of course, so she won't stay in that position but it's a big boost for GB's team hopes.</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>2.09pm</strong> Ingrid Kilmke, a contender for individual gold, goes top with 54.7 and looks pretty pleased about it too.</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>2.14pm </strong>Oh..trouble for Didier Dhennin who picks up three time points to make 59.8 He fits in behind Tina Cook. However, this is great news for all of those of you who are pelting virtual fruit at the French.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>2.17pm</strong> Brazil finish with 334.10 points. Canada on 321. No medals for them, but they do get to go home to Brazil. Germany currently lead the table with 169.7 points, Australia follow with 175.8, Britain on 201.5 and Italy on 271.6. </p> <p>Missing Sir Steve Redgrave? Sleepless nights thinking about Matthew Pinsent? This will cure what ails you: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.olympicsrowing1\">Michael Phillips'</a> report on the coxless four. Stop sniggering at the back.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>2.23pm</strong> In swimming news, <strong>Britain</strong> have made the 4x200m freestyle final. Back with the horseys, Ireland have finished on 276.10, which isn't enough to beat the Americans. Darn.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>2.28pm </strong>Mary Young wants to know the jumping order so she doesn't have to waste work time watching the Swedes. It's France, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, the US, Sweden, New Zealand, Italy, GB, Austria, Germany</p> <p>And 90.10 for Joe Meyer means the Kiwis finish on 240.90 which is better than Sweden and the US. I fear what this means for Ireland.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>2.32pm</strong> It's that man Bruce Jackson again: \"I'm watching the show jumping with the sound down here at work. I don't know much about it. But that little grey Kiwi horse did really well. It hit almost everything.\"</p> <p>I would make a sarky comment but it looks like <strong>Britain have bronze</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>2.34pm</strong> The Italians finish on 246.10 so they are tucked in behind New Zealand, which should mean that Team GB are safe for a medal. Now it's Mary King, who is also in the running for the individual, don't forget.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>2.35pm</strong> Safe so far...Oh no!</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>2.36pm</strong> King picks up eight points for ramming the last two fences. She gets 64.10, which gives GB bronze but damages her chances of an individual medal.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>2.37pm</strong> It's gonna be<br><strong>1 Germany<br>2 Australia<br>3 Great Britain<br></strong></p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>2.38pm</strong> Megan Jones picks up 55.00 for her last round and the Aussies finish on 171.20. Germany's Hinrich Romeike can now take on his last round as a gold medal winner, which surely means less pressure for...oops.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> The individual leader knocks off one fence, which keeps him just about ahead of his colleague Ingrid Kilmke. A superb leap at the last for 54.2. He looks quite happy about it. </p> <p>So no change from this morning in the team awards but the individual medals are still quite open. Oh, and France came last. Really last.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>2.44pm</strong> Sorry I should have stressed that it was the <strong>men's</strong> team who qualified for the 4x200m freestyle relay. It's been a bit frantic here, and the coffee machine is broken to boot. I have a short respite now before the individual eventing. Tina Cook, Mary King and William Fox-Pitt wil all compete, with Cook best placed for Britain.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>2.48pm </strong>Like I said, I'm new to eventing, but this seems <strong>a bit harsh</strong>. Apparently, Germany were stripped of their team eventing gold in Athens four years ago when Bettina Hoy was disqualified for crossing the starting line in a warm-up lap before the show jumping. She also lost her individual gold. That disqualification meant the team gold went to France.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>2.50pm</strong> \"We're all on a real high. The teams ahead of us performed incredibly well,\" says William Fox-Pitt. Full table to follow, but I can tell you that Tina Cook is joint sixth in the individuals.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>2.57pm</strong> Sympathy levels for the Germans of Athens '04 are low. \"Yep it was a bit tough as the Germans were only following orders,\" chortles Martin Leck. </p> <p>\"I find eventing like watching wood warp but do remember that whole disqualification kerfuffle. I think it was the time when the word schadenfreude really came into its own,\" fnarrs Simon Martin.</p> <p>That table in full:</p> <p>1 Germany 168.10<br>2 Australia 171.20<br>3 Britain 185.70<br>4 Sweden 230.50<br>5 New Zealand 240.90<br>6 Italy 246.40<br>7 USA 250.00<br>8 Ireland 276.10<br>9 Canada 321.00<br>10 Brazil 334.10<br><strong>11 France 1138.80</strong></p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>3.08pm</strong></p> <p>Regarding Bettina Hoy's disqualification, Anthony Hulse puts his arm around my shoulders and assures me: \"Not harsh in the slightest, she wasn't disqualified it was just that the clock started the first time she went across the start line so she ended up with a load of time penalties and finished out of the medals. <br>Nothing more than a case of sticking to the rules which, being German, I would assume she was perfectly happy about. Besides, it meant the individual gold went to a British bloke, so it all worked out perfectly.\"</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>3.10pm</strong> The individual eventing final isn't for another hour or so and it's getting late in Beijing, so I'm going to leave it at that. Thanks for your emails and rapt attention, and don't forget to clock back on at 2am tomorrow morning, when we will bring you more live coverage of everything Olympic that matters.</p> <p><strong>5.10pm:</strong> Before that, though, there's just time to let you know some more brilliant medal news for Team GB. After her fine display of guiding horses over brightly coloured barriers, Tina Cook has been given a shiny bronze medal for her efforts. \"I can't speak,\" lied an emotional Cook, before compounding the falsehood by adding: \"It is unbelievable, like a dream come true.\" Germany's Hinrich Romeike won gold on Marius while Gina Miles of the United States claimed silver on McKinlaigh.</p>"
