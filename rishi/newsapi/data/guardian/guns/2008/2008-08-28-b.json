  "<p>Three Hong Kong stalwarts - Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam and Johnny To - play the filmic equivalent of pass-the-parcel on Triangle, a convoluted crime caper about a mysterious gold coin and the luckless bozos on its trail. Blame Hark for the convolutions: his opening segment leaves a knot of endless, fiendish subplots for his successors to unpick, tidy and then resolve. Devotees of the genre will no doubt relish contrasting the Hark style with the Lam stamp and the To brand. The rest of us have our work cut out figuring out who's what and where and why as Triangle zig-zags gamely towards the inevitable gun-popping finale.</p>",
  "<p>On a shelf in a cellar in the former KGB headquarters in Chernigov, in the black earth country in the heart of the Ukraine, lies a thick file with a crumbling brown cardboard cover. It contains about three pounds of paper, the sheets carefully numbered and bound. Its subject is my mother's father, Boris Lvovich Bibikov, whose name is entered on the cover in curiously elaborate, copperplate script. The file records my grandfather's progress from life to death at the hands of Stalin's secret police as the summer of 1937 turned to autumn and the great Purge of the Communist Party swept away a generation of old Bolsheviks.</p> <p>I saw the file in a dingy office in the old secret police headquarters in Kiev fifty-eight years after his death. It sat heavily in my lap, eerily malignant, a swollen tumor of paper. Typed on flimsy forms or handwritten on scrap paper in archaic script, the file existed on that peculiarly Russian border between banal bureaucracy and painful poignancy. It was a compilation of the absurdly petty - a receipt for the confiscation of a Browning automatic and 23 rounds of ammunition, another for the confiscation of his daughter's Young Pioneer holiday trip voucher - and the starkly shocking. Long confessions, written in microscopic, crabbed writing, covered in blotches and apparently written under torture, my grandfather's confessions to being an 'enemy of the people'. The final document is a clumsily mimeographed slip, confirming that the sentence of death passed by a closed court in Kiev had been carried out on October 14th, 1937. The signature of his executioner is a casual squiggle. Since the careful bureaucrats who compiled the file neglected to say where he was buried, this stack of paper is the closest thing to Boris Bibikov's earthly remains.</p> <p>In the attic of no. 7, Alderney Street, Pimlico, London, is a handsome steamer trunk, marked 'W.H.M Matthews, St. Antony's College, Oxford, ANGLIA' in neat black painted letters. It contains a love story. Or perhaps it contains a love. In the trunk are hundreds of my parents' love-letters, carefully arranged by date in stacks, starting in July 1964, ending in October 1969. Many are on thin airmail paper, others on multiple sheets of neat white writing paper. For the six years that my British father and Russian mother were separated by the fortunes of the Cold War, they wrote to each other every day, sometimes twice a day. They talk of tiny incidents from the few months they spent together in Moscow, they gossip about mutual friends and meals and films. At moments their epistolary conversation is so intimate that reading the letters feels like a violation. At others the pain of separation is so intense that the paper seems to tremble with it. But above all the letters are charged with loss, and loneliness, and with a love so great, as my mother wrote, \"that it can move mountains and turn the world on its axis.\" And though the letters are full of pain, I think that they also describe the happiest period of their lives.</p> <p>As I leaf through the letters now, sitting on the floor of the London attic which was my childhood room, where I slept for eighteen years not a yard from where the letters lay in their locked trunk in the box-room under the eaves of the house, and where I listened to the sound of my parents raised voices drifting up the stairs, it occurs to me that here is where my parents' love is. \"Every letter is a piece of our soul, they mustn't get lost,\" my mother wrote during their first agonizing months. \"Your letters bring me little pieces of you, of your life, your breath, your beating heart.\" And so they spilled their souls out onto paper reams of paper, impregnated with pain, desire and love, chains of paper, relays of it, rumbling through the night on mail trains across Europe almost without interruption for six years. \"As our letters travel they take on a magical quality - in that lies their strength,\" she wrote. \"Every line is the blood of my heart, and there is no limit to how much I can pour out.\" But by the time my parents were re-united, they found there was barely enough love left over. It had all been turned into ink, and written over a thousand sheets of paper, carefully folded in a trunk in the attic of a terraced house in London.</p> <p>We believe that we think with our minds, but in reality, I found, we really think with our blood. Blood follows you and draws you towards itself. Twenty six years after my mother finally left Moscow to marry my father, I moved in the opposite direction, back to Russia. For much of my time there, I thought I was in a story without a narrative, a constantly changing slide-show of phantasmagoria which Moscow was projecting onto my life for my personal delectation. But in fact I was caught in a cool web of blood-knowledge which was slowly winding me in. I have found myself, time and again, tripping over the roots of experience which I shared with my parents and grandparents. Echoes of their lives kept cropping up in mine like ghosts, things which remained unchanged in the rhythms of the city which I believed was so full of the new and the now. The damp-wool smell of the Metro in winter. Rainy nights on the backstreets of the Arbat when the eerie bulk of the Foreign Ministry glows like a fog-bound liner. The lights of a Siberian city like an island in a sea of forest seen from the window of a tiny, bouncing plane. The smell of the sea-wind at Tallinn docks. And, at towards the end of my time in Moscow, the sudden, piercing realization that all my life, I had loved precisely the woman who was sitting by my side at a table among friends in a warm fug of cigarette smoke and conversation in the kitchen of an apartment off the Arbat. I came to Moscow to get away from my parents. Instead, I found them there, though for a long time I didn't know it, or refused to see it. So I began to write a story about Russia and my family, about a place which made us and freed us and inspired us and very nearly broke us.</p> <p>It's hard, now, to imagine the thrill and the mystery of moving to Moscow, the secretive capital of a parallel, hostile world, as my father did as a young diplomat in September 1958. The Moscow he knew is separated from the Russia in which I lived not just by half a lifetime but by a seismic shift of history. My father's generation was defined by a bitter ideological divide which ran across the world, and he, for reasons that I only began to understand when I went to live in Russia myself thirty years later, did everything in his power to live on the other side of that divide. The time and city were pregnant with pitfalls for a young man in love with Russia and blessed, or cursed, with a strong wayward streak. The Cold War, which was born along with my father's fascination for Russia, was approaching its height. Soviet tanks had recently crushed the Hungarian Rising, and there could be no doubt that it was the ambition of Socialism to conquer the world. To the Embassy Cold Warriors with whom he worked, Moscow was then the heart of all the darkness in the world.</p> <p>When my father first arrived in Moscow, the city's soul was swelling with victory and pride, not deflating in exhaustion. The Moscow he knew was a controlled, oppressive place, not the teeming mayhem into which it was to descend after the Soviet Union collapsed. And emotionally, for my father, the distance was far greater. For a generation unused to travel, Russia might as well have been on a different planet. But Mervyn could not have been happier. For all the rigidity and control, my father found Moscow a place of adventures, where he was courted by the KGB and fell in love. He had finally loosed himself from his home place in the world, and was drifting towards a place where he fitted in.</p> <p>My Russia was a society adrift. Over the last seventy years Russians had lost much of their culture and their God. But at least the Soviet state had compensated by filling the ideological vacuum with its own bold myths and strict codes. It fed people, taught and clothed them, ordered their lives from cradle to grave and, most importantly, thought for them. Communists - men like my grandfather - had tried to create a new kind of man, emptying men of their old beliefs and re-filling them with civic duty, patriotism and docility. But when Communist ideology was stripped away, so its quaintly Fifties morality also disappeared into the black hole of discarded mythologies. People put their faith in television healers, Japanese apocalyptic cults, even in the jealous old God of Orthodoxy. But more profound than any of Russia's other, new-found faiths, was an absolute, bottomless nihilism. Suddenly there were no rules, no holds barred, and everything went for those bold and ruthless enough to go out and grab as much as they could.</p> <p>Even after years in Moscow, I can never quite shake the feeling of being in a weird cat's cradle of conflicting ages. Even the city's thrusting modernity is still laced with quaintly historic touches: soldiers in jackboots and breeches; timeless babushkas in headscarves; ragged, bearded beggars straight out of Dostoyevsky; obligatory coat checks and rotary phones; fur hats; drivers and maids; bread with lard; abacuses instead of cash registers; inky newspapers; the smell of wood smoke and outdoor toilets in the suburbs. Some rhythms of life seem absolutely unchanged from my fathers' day, my grandfather's day even.</p> <p>There have been a few during my time in Russia when I think I have caught glimpses of the nightmare world my grandfather entered in July 1937. A police station in Moscow where I was taken after being beaten up by some drunken Tatars one night in 1996, which was impregnated with the eternal Russian prison odour of sweat, piss and despair. The investigator's office where I watched for hours as the detective's crawling pen painstakingly took down details of my statement, denting the cheap official paper under harsh, institutional lamplight. And then a few days later, the dingy hall where I was taken to confront my assailants, they weeping in manacles as I sat high on a dais with the investigator in front of their swelling criminal file. A journalistic visit to Butirskaya prison, where heat and humidity were so intense that it was hard to inhale and the prisoners had empty, sunken eyes. I tried to talk to a couple of them, briefly, but it was so uncomfortable speaking to a stranger in such unnatural proximity, chest to chest, I found I had nothing to say. Neither then nor later, could I humanize the prisoners or relate to them as people. They had passed through the looking-glass into another reality; they had been transformed into something less than human, closer to the casual brutality of a herd of animals. Their faces were the faces of men whose whole lives had imploded into the space of a few feet of the fetid room they inhabited. They stared at me as I pushed past from a distance of six inches, but when I looked into their eyes I knew they were looking at me from a distance I could never, ever cross. For a few hours, I imagine that I saw and smelt and touched the very Russian underworld of crime and punishment which swallowed my grandfather two generations before. It was enough, perhaps, to start picturing what it was like, at least physically. What it was like in his head and heart is a place I never wish to visit.</p> <p>\u2022 Excerpt from Stalin's Children: Three Generations of Love and War by Owen Matthews, published by Bloomsbury.</p>",
  "<p>This time when I wake up, rays of yellow morning are leaking in through the holes in the door and the torn blinds. They riddle the gloom, and I can see dust particles dancing within them. Our neighborhood is quiet. When I go into the parlor, Papa is moving from window to window to ensure that the blinds leave no space for outsiders to peep in. Maman is standing at the table, straining her eyes as she examines two framed photographs.</p> <p>One is from my parents' traditional wedding. It's ten years old. I was in Maman's belly then. All the women are elegantly dressed, the imyitero draping over them like Le P\u00e8re Mertens's short vestment. Married women who have given birth to sons wear urugoli crowns. Maman got hers only last year, when Jean was born. There are some cows tethered in the background. They were part of the dowry Papa offered for Maman. But no matter what I try to focus on, my eyes go to Tonton Andr\u00e9's smiling face. I cover it with my hand, but Maman pushes my fingers off. I look at the other picture instead, which was taken last year, after my parents' church wedding. Papa, Maman, and I are in front. I'm the flower girl, my hands gloved and a flower basket hanging down from my neck with white ribbons. Maman holds baby Jean close to her heart, like a wedding bouquet.</p> <p>\"Maman, Jean is lonely in the bedroom,\" I say.</p> <p>\"I hope he sleeps the whole day,\" she says, without looking at me.</p> <p>\"Won't ghosts steal him?\"</p> <p>\"He'll get used to them. Go get yourself some food, Monique.\"</p> <p>\"Oya, Maman, I don't want to eat.\"</p> <p>\"Then go and shower.\"</p> <p>\"Alone? I don't want to shower.\"</p> <p>She touches my nightie. \"You need to shower.\"</p> <p>\"Maman, when wizards pee . . .\"</p> <p>\"Don't tell me now.\" She looks at Papa. \"She needs a shower.\"</p> <p>Hearing this, I raise my nightie to show Maman my swollen thigh, but she slaps it down, saying, \"You'll get a new pair of underpants. Your face will be beautiful again.\"</p> <p>I return my attention to the pictures. I scratch at Tonton Andr\u00e9's face with my nails to erase him from our family. But the glass saves him Maman isn't looking at the photos anymore; her eyes are closed, as if in prayer. I pick up a brass letter opener and begin to scratch the glass over my tonton's face. </p> <p>The sound distracts Papa from the window and he gives me a bad look. I stop.</p> <p>\"Why did you come down\u2014 come back?\" he says to Maman, searching my face to see whether I've understood the question. I haven't.</p> <p>He turns back to Maman. \"Woman, why? Return to where you were last night. Please. Leave.\"</p> <p>\"Whatever you do,\" she says, \"do not let my daughter know.\"</p> <p>\"She should!\" he says, then recoils from the force in his own voice.</p> <p>My parents are hiding something from me. Maman is very stubborn about it. Their sentences enter my ears as randomly as a toss of the dice on our Ludo board. Papa looks guilty, like a child who can't keep a secret.</p> <p>\"I can't bear it,\" he says. \"I can't.\"</p> <p>\"If Monique knew where I was last night,\" Maman argues, \"your family would've forced it out of her and shed blood.\"</p> <p>As they talk, invisible people are breathing everywhere \u2014 at least twenty ghosts are in the air around us. When Maman speaks, the ghosts let out groans of agreement, but my parents don't seem to hear them.</p> <p>Papa shakes his head. \"I mean, you should never have come back. I could have convinced them . . .\"</p> <p>\"We needed to be with the children.\"</p> <p>I don't understand why Maman is saying she wants to be with me when she won't even look my way. I see dirty water dripping down the white wall beside me. It is coming from the ceiling. At first, it comes down in two thin lines. Then the lines widen and swell into one. Then two more lines come down, in spurts, like little spiders gliding down on threads from a branch of the mango tree in our yard. I touch the liquid with the tip of my finger. Blood.</p> <p>\"Ghost! Ghost!\" I scream, diving toward Papa.</p> <p>\"It's not blood,\" he says.</p> <p>\"You are lying! It's blood! It's blood!\"</p> <p>Papa tries to get between me and the wall, but I get in front of him and hug him. I cling to his body, climbing up until my hands are around his neck and my legs wrapped around his waist. He tries to muffle my shouts with his hands, but I wriggle and twist until he bows under my weight, and we nearly topple over. He staggers and regains his balance, then he releases his breath, and his stiff body softens. He puts his arms around me and carries me to the sofa. He holds my face to his heart, hiding me from the blood. I stop shouting. Maman is grinding her teeth, and there is a stubborn<br>look on her face \u2014 maybe the Wizard has fixed her too.</p> <p>\u2022 Extract from Say You're One of Them by Uwem Akpan, published by Abacus.</p>",
  "<p>On April 30, 1945, the day of Hitler's suicide, \"zero hour\" in modern German history, the 103rd Infantry and Tenth Armored divisions of the U.S. Army took possession of the Alpine resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which the war had hardly touched. Two hundred Allied bombers had been poised to lay waste to the town and its environs, but the strike was called off at the behest of a surrendering German officer.</p> <p>Early in the morning a security detachment turned in to the driveway of a Garmisch villa, intending to use it as a command post. When the senior officer, Lieutenant Milton Weiss, went inside the house, an old man came downstairs to meet him. \"I am Richard Strauss,\" he said, \"the composer of Rosenkavalier and Salome.\" Strauss studied the soldier's face for signs of sympathy. Weiss, who had played piano at Jewish resorts in the Catskills, recognized the name and nodded his head. Strauss went on to recount his experiences in the war, pointedly mentioning the tribulations of his Jewish relatives. Weiss chose to install his post elsewhere.<br> At 11:00 a.m. on the same day, a squad of jeeps came up the drive, these led by Major John Kramers, of the 103rd Infantry Division's military-government branch. Kramers told the family that they had fifteen minutes to evacuate. Strauss walked out to the major's jeep, holding documents that declared him to be an honorary citizen of Morgantown, West Virginia, together with part of the manuscript of Rosenkavalier. \"I am Richard Strauss, the composer,\" he said. Kramers's face lit up; he was a Strauss fan. An \"Off Limits\" sign was placed on the lawn.</p> <p>In the days that followed, Strauss posed for photographs, played the Rosenkavalier waltzes on the piano, and smiled bemusedly as soldiers inspected his statue of Beethoven and asked who it was. \"If they ask one more time,\" he muttered, \"I'm telling them it's Hitler's father.\"</p> <p>All over Europe, young veterans were emerging from the rubble of the war into adulthood. Among them were several future leaders of the postwar musical scene, and they would be indelibly marked by what they had experienced in adolescence. Karlheinz Stockhausen was the son of a spiritually tortured Nazi Party member who went to the eastern front and never returned. His mother was confined for many years to a sanatorium, then killed in the Nazi euthanasia program. By the age of sixteen, Stockhausen was working in a mobile hospital behind the western front, where he tried to revive soldiers who had fallen victim to Allied incendiary bombs. \"I would try to find an opening in the mouth area for a straw,\" he recalled, \"in order to pour some liquid into these men, whose bodies were still moving, but there was only a yellow ball-like mass where the face should have been.\" On a given day Stockhausen and his comrades would haul thirty or forty corpses into churches that had been converted into morgues.</p> <p>Hans Werner Henze trained as a radio operator for Panzer battalions and spent the first part of 1945 riding aimlessly around the ruined landscape. Bernd Alois Zimmermann fought on the front lines of Hitler's ill-fated invasion of the Soviet Union. Luciano Berio was conscripted into the army of Mussolini's Republic of Sal\u00f2 and nearly blew off his right hand with a gun that he did not know how to use. Iannis Xenakis joined the Greek Communist resistance, fighting not only the Germans but also the British, who, in an early demonstration of Cold War Realpolitik, made common cause with local Fascists when they occupied the country. At the end of 1944 a British shell landed on a building where Xenakis was hiding; after watching a comrade's brains splatter against a wall, he passed out and awoke to find that his left eye and part of his face were gone.</p> <p>In July 1945, the young English composer Benjamin Britten, who had just scored a triumph in London with his opera Peter Grimes, accompanied the violinist Yehudi Menuhin on a brief tour of defeated Germany. The two men visited the concentration camp at Bergen- Belsen and performed for a crowd of former inmates. Stupefied by what he saw, Britten decided to write a cycle of songs on the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, the most spiritually scouring poetry he could find. On August 6 he set to music Sonnet 14, which begins, \"Batter my heart, three person'd God.\" Earlier the same day, the first operational atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima. There is an eerie coincidence here, for J. Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the American nuclear program, cherished the same Donne poem, and evidently had it in mind when he gave the site of the first atomic test the name Trinity.</p> <p>On August 19, Britten finished his cycle by setting Donne's sonnet \"Death be not proud.\" The singer declaims the words \"And death shall be no more\" on a rising scale; fixates for nine long beats on the word \"Death\"; and finally, over a clanging dominant-tonic cadence, thunders, \"Thou shalt die.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Extract from The Rest is Noise by Alex Ross, published by Fourth Estate.</p>",
  "<p>When I think back to my last day in Africa, I can't help but remember something Maureen O'Sullivan said to me at the very beginning of my career. \"There, there, Cheeta. The hurt will die down. It has to. Otherwise none of us could stand life!\" </p> <p>Maureen's rather breezily delivered comment, by the way, was an attempt, some fifty minutes into Tarzan and His Mate, to offer consolation on the death of my on-screen mother. My on-screen mother who had just been impaled on the horn of a stampeding rhinoceros while saving Jane's life! She said it briskly, in her trademark sing-song, which made it seem as if she was bucking me up after a surprise omission from the lacrosse First X rather than helping me come to terms with a bereavement she herself had caused. I'm getting off the point but if Maureen's daughter, Mia Farrow, had been fatally gored while saving my life, I'd have been straight round to hers with an apology I'd at least have tried to make sound sincere. (Though \u2013 dare one say it? \u2013 that would have been one hell of a popular rhino in Hollywood.)</p> <p>But that was Maureen all over, I'm afraid. She couldn't even act affection for animals although, to be wholly honest and give the harmless old trout her due, it was probably just me she disliked. To be wholly, wholly honest, I don't think she ever recovered from the downgrading implied by that title. Not Tarzan and Jane, you'll note, or Tarzan and His Wife, but Tarzan and His Mate. That is, a buddy movie built around the electric chemistry of the Weissmuller-Cheeta double-act. A bitter pill for Maureen to swallow, that title, but there, there, my dear, the hurt will die down. Actually, had she and I ever been able to communicate, that's exactly what I should have told her when she was, yet again, sobbing and swearing at me after I'd gotten in another good nip to her flank \u2013\"There, there, Maureen. The hurt will die down!\" See how she'd have liked that for consolation while she was wailing at the crew to fetch her bandages and iodine!</p> <p>Forgive me, I really am getting off the point. For the record, Maureen and I certainly had our ups and downs, I won't deny it. But there has always been a strong professional respect between us, and I think we both cherish our relationship, which has always been the healthier for a bit of teasing.</p> <p>My point is: those are wise words, no matter how poorly delivered by however atrocious an actress. The hurt will die down. It has to. Otherwise none of us could stand life. And never mind that when the hurt doesn't die down you have to go ahead and stand it all the same. What Jane said remains true \u2013 call it Jane's Law. Pain has its own long-term interests at heart. Like a virus too smart to kill off its host, it ebbs, dies down and, to our own great surprise, we live through it. Just as, for instance, my dear friend Ronnie Colman lived through his hideous wreck of a divorce from Thelma Raye and went on to marry my colleague Benita Hume, a more than adequate Cousin Rita in Tarzan Escapes. Or, in fact, just as Benita herself lived through that dreadful period after poor Ronnie's lungs killed him: she picked herself up from the floor and married George Sanders. Or, indeed, just as George in his turn lived through it when bone cancer killed his poor beloved Benita. Lived through it, that is, until of course he eventually couldn't stand it any longer and killed himself in a fishing village near Barcelona on a spring day in 1972, leaving behind him a note calling the world a \"cesspool\". Sorry, not a good example . . . Jane's Law does have these occasional tragic exceptions. </p> <p>Anyway, that last day, sitting in a monsoon on the dock at Kigoma, I was frighteningly underweight and probably still in shock. A nagging voice kept telling me I wasn't out of the woods yet. But I could already feel my grief and pain beginning to die down. I was younger and less vulnerable then. I had an immigrant's resources. I was damn well going to live through it.</p> <p>It wasn't just that we'd been rescued, though that was, of course, a miracle in itself. There was also the astonishing care that was taken over our rehabilitation, which I like to think was down to Irving Thalberg's legendary attention to detail. We had no way of knowing this at the time, but on the dock that day in Kigoma there was a collection of apes, monkeys and other creatures that MGM scouts had selected from among literally millions of hopefuls to play in Metro pictures. We were \"part of the family\" now, as Louis B. Mayer liked to say of everyone from the carpenters to Norma Shearer, valuable assets to be cosseted and packed in cotton wool. Hence the tiny protective crates in which we found ourselves snugly ensconced on the quayside. We were housed in pairs, each of us safe inside our own ingenious little slatted wooden shelters, where the raging alphas could never get at us. It was typical of the Metro touch. Once you were in with Metro, you were in. You had everything you could have asked for.</p> <p>\u2022 Extract from Me, Cheeta: The Autobiography by Cheeta, published by Fourth Estate.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337063085\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Police have started to sift through tonnes of debris at the gutted estate of the millionaire Christopher Foster, who remains missing with his family amid increasing speculation about his business dealings.</p> <p>Forensic science specialists carried out autopsies yesterday on the bodies of three horses found close to the burnt-out shells of four luxury cars in a stable block separate from Foster's main mansion but set ablaze at the same time.</p> <p>The head of the inquiry, Superintendent Gary Higgins, of West Mercia police, said detectives were sure the fire had been started deliberately but would not confirm that gun cartridges and pools of blood had been found outside the buildings on the family's four hectare (10 acre) estate at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire.</p> <p>He repeated appeals for any sightings since the start of the bank holiday weekend of Foster, 50, his wife, Jill, 49, and their daughter Kirstie, 15, who was on holiday from her boarding school at nearby Ellesmere. All three returned to the house on Monday night, hours before the blazes erupted at 5am. They had spent the evening at a barbecue given by a Shropshire car dealer, and were said to have been in good spirits.</p> <p>Police maintained a cordon round fields and woods at the estate, Osbaston House, which dates from the 17th century. Through the trees, a cherrypicker platform could be seen, with men removing tiles from a teetering roof and scanning the smouldering wreckage below.</p> <p>A search team was given the all-clear by structural experts to enter the roofless main house last night, where a search will start for human remains. But a watch remains in place on ports and airports for Foster, who was described by an appeal court judge in May as an asset-stripper who was \"not to be trusted\".</p> <p>Neighbours said he was rarely seen except in one of his fleet of cars, often heading for shooting parties with businessmen who had bought similar properties on the picturesque border with Wales. Terence Baines, a former accountant at Foster's thermal insulation firm Ulva Ltd, which went into liquidation a year ago, said: \"He liked to live life big, with holidays and cars.\"</p> <p>Foster's complex financial dealings had become an increasing matter of comment after court hearings that questioned his business morality. The high court and later Lord Justice Rimmer in the appeal court condemned a series of manoeuvres by Foster in a prolonged attempt to avoid \u00a3800,000 damages from a breach of contract with a distribution company.</p> <p>But friends and business contacts described Foster as congenial and a family man, devoted to his daughter. The \u00a31.2m mansion had been equipped with every luxury, and two of the horses were bought at high prices earlier this year for Foster and Kirstie to ride.</p> <p>Police attempted to quash rumours about the cause of the fire and would not comment on reports that a horsebox with deflated tyres had been left behind the mansion's electronic gates to delay rescuers. </p> <p>Higgins said the task of searching the sprawling building would take time. </p> <p>\"Fire crews have been damping down hotspots to bring the temperature low enough for structural work to begin. It is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined. This is not something which can be done quickly. Once we have access to the house, we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire.\"</p> <p>The family had lavished money on the estate, constructing a lake, planting trees and raising sheep, ducks and hens, as well as keeping the horses. Four dogs are also missing and the gutted remains of Mrs Foster's 4x4, whose personalised number plate JILL40 was familiar locally, stand on the gravel drive.</p> <p>Internet messages from friends paid tribute to Kirstie and hoped for her speedy appearance. The headteacher of Ellesmere College, Brendan Wignall, said: \"We are very concerned for the safety of Kirstie and her family, who are in our thoughts and prayers. She is a charming, popular and hard-working girl with many friends, all of whom are hoping that she and her family will be found safe and well.\"</p>",
  "<p>The low-fare transatlantic airline Zoom last night cancelled all flights and left hundreds of passengers stranded after it was forced into administration. </p> <p>The Canadian-British carrier, which operated from five UK airports as well as Paris and Rome, apologised to passengers and advised them to contact their banks for refunds. It blamed its plight on the \"economic climate\" and \"horrendous increase\" in the price of fuel which added $50m to its operating costs last year.</p> <p>Hours earlier, Irish carrier Aer Lingus warned that it needed to cut costs, raising fears of job losses. The airline reported a first half operating loss of \u20ac22.3m (\u00a317.9m), down from a profit of \u20ac2.6m a year earlier, and warned it would not make a profit in the next six months. Chief executive Dermot Mannion blamed the rising oil price.</p> <p>Zoom's collapse was brought to a head when one of the airline's planes was detained in Calgary, Canada, on Wednesday because of financial problems. Yesterday airport owner BAA, on instructions from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, prevented a Canada-bound aircraft from leaving Glasgow because of non-payment of air traffic control fees.</p> <p>Last night the airline, which was founded by Scottish brothers John and Hugh Boyle in 2001, said it had no choice but to suspend operations, putting the company's 260 British and 450 Canadian staff in danger of losing their jobs. The Boyle brothers said: \"We are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights. We have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying.</p> <p>\"Even late today we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying. Having been unable to complete the investment package, the directors of Zoom had no option but to instigate administration proceedings.\"</p> <p>The airline is based at Gatwick and flew to eight destinations in Canada, as well as New York, San Diego, Fort Lauderdale and Bermuda. </p> <p>Passengers at Glasgow who had been due to fly to Canada accused the airline of failing to provide enough information.</p> <p>Carolyn Kristjansson, 45, from Vancouver, was due to travel with her husband and son on the 12.40pm flight back home after visiting family in Scotland. </p> <p>\"We arrived at 9am, more than three hours before our flight, and waited for 45 minutes then we were told that the flight had been delayed due to technical problems,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We were told to check back and some people left the airport but we have been waiting here as we had nowhere to go and had limited currency. We've just found out what's happened and my husband is trying to phone the credit card company now to see where we stand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Doing business in the world's most spied-on country has surely upped the ante for armed robbers. Not according to this rough and ready British heist pic, which sees a bunch of cockney likely lads make do the old-fashioned way with big guns and a few pairs of stockings. Never mind CCTV, they check in a couple of hours early for a flight to the German World Cup finals. A canny alibi, it gives them just enough time to nip back into town, swipe millions in used notes from a City of London bank and squirm out of a tunnel handily dug earlier. Perhaps the most serenely naive calculation in all this is that they could ever make it through traffic in the capital back to the airport to catch their flight. It's a less flashy film than we can expect from Guy Ritchie's Rocknrolla, which is out next week. In fact, with a couple of ex-EastEnders cast (Paul Nicholls and Shaun Williamson) Daylight Robbery has the away day, the-sun-shines-outside-of-Walford feel of an Enders special. All told, a bit of a Regi Blinker.</p>",
  "<p>As Percy the peacock pecks at his reflection in the shiny doors of a Mercedes, Helen Grant is around the corner, agreeing to be interviewed by her swimming pool. This scene from the Surrey stockbroker belt suggests that Grant, who will run in Ann Widdecombe's constituency at the next election, is a classic Conservative parliamentary candidate. </p> <p>But Grant is not. A successful solicitor, brought up by her single mother on a council estate in Carlisle, at the next general election Grant is almost certain to become the Tories' first ever black female MP. And this pioneering status confers an unusual amount of attention.</p> <p>So far, it has not been terribly nice. Widdecombe has very publicly backed her successor but criticised David Cameron's policy of ensuring 50% of the Conservatives' A-list candidates are women - the policy that may have helped Grant win the nomination for Widdecombe's safe Tory seat of Maidstone and the Weald. Then a Sunday newspaper revealed that Grant had joined the Labour party in 2004, sought to be a local councillor and offered her legal offices to Labour before her conversion to the Conservatives.</p> <p>You could understand both Labour and the Conservatives tussling over this prospective MP because Grant, who is 46 and married with two teenage sons, is political gold dust: her humble upbringing and high achievement tells an upbeat story about multicultural Britain and she has a lot to say about family breakdown, having set up her own practice specialising in family law and domestic violence.</p> <p>Grant grew up in Carlisle with her mother Gladys, her grandmother and great grandmother after her parents separated. (Her father Julius, then a medical student, moved to America, where he still lives.) She doesn't like to tell tales of an impoverished upbringing - Carlisle is \"beautiful\" and her childhood was \"happy\" - but her first eight years were spent in a council house, and the family had neither a car nor a television.</p> <p>Perhaps most formative was the fact that she was virtually the only non-white person in Carlisle - her mother was white, and her father was black. \"I was always noticeable and I always knew I was different,\" says Grant. \"I did get some bullying at school because I was different, because I was brown. But a lot of other kids were bullied as well - if you were a bit too tall, a bit too small.\"</p> <p>Her background, and the fact that her single mother was a nurse, would, I imagine, have made her a natural Labour supporter. She disagrees. Although her family were not overtly political, Gladys approved of Margaret Thatcher. \"One of the key political moments was Thatcher's right-to-buy council house policy. I remember the excitement that went round that neighbourhood, seeing people contemplating ownership after a lifetime of renting.\"</p> <p>After studying law in Guildford, she joined a practice in Wimbledon and discovered how law could make a difference when she got an injunction to stop a husband beating up a wife. In 1996, she set up Grants Solicitors, specialising in sensitive family law, protecting women from harassment and wives and children from abuse. It now has 12,000 clients and 25 staff, including her husband Simon. </p> <p>Grant's decision to enter politics came in 2004. \"My children weren't babies any longer and the practice had become established,\" she says. \"I almost felt - at last, I'm ready for public service.\" Grant first had a look at the party in power, Labour, and says she joined them because they claimed to be champions of social justice. Quickly though, she felt that this was spin. \"It was almost looking in the biscuit barrel, not liking the look of the biscuits, and slamming the lid shut,\" she says.</p> <p>She also seems slightly miffed at the lack of interest that Labour showed her. She offered her legal offices to help the party before the 2005 general election but two activists came round, took a look, and never got back to her. You would think a high-achieving black woman would be a dream for Labour, I say. \"To be honest with you, yes,\" she replies.</p> <p>After her flirtation with Labour she felt in the \"wilderness\". But in 2006 her conversion to the Conservatives was swiftly sealed when David Cameron became leader. He was the decisive factor, she says. \"I heard one of his speeches when he said he recognised there was a whole generation of people who worked hard, who wanted nice things themselves, but who also believed in social justice. I thought, that's me. Yes, we are business people. We do want to make money, we do want to do well, but we really care about looking after each other.\"</p> <p>So Grant joined the Tories and applied to be a parliamentary candidate. She says she instantly felt welcomed, although she has only briefly met Cameron twice. Her relatively late political education has also been helped by a mentoring project devised by the charity Operation Black Vote, which enabled her to spend time shadowing Oliver Letwin in parliament.</p> <p>Grant's constituency is very white. In the past, black Tories have failed to get elected in white seats - most notably black barrister John Taylor, who stood in Cheltenham in 1992. Is Grant worried? \"I don't think I'm fearful of anything, apart from possibly rats,\" she says. \"I'm a careful person and there will be no complacency in my campaign. I'm treating Maidstone and the Weald as if it's a marginal and I will work as hard as I possibly can.\"</p> <p>Whether Grant likes it or not, her pioneering status means she will be seen as a spokesperson on race. Whenever a Tory makes a racist comment, she will be asked for a response. Is that limiting? \"We'll have to wait and see,\" she says. \"I'm not bored or frustrated with it because I haven't done it. People have asked me to, but I haven't, because in this first period I really wanted to focus on the constituency. If I'm asked to comment in the future I will but I won't be the person always putting my hand up ... There are a lot of people who are diverse and of colour [in the Conservative party] who may well have a different view from me.\"</p> <p>She gives short shrift to the furore over Boris Johnson's writings about \"piccaninnies\" - \"I do not believe for one minute that Boris is racist\" - and says Cameron is making good his promise to tackle diversity imbalances in the party. \"I believed he'd do it and obviously my selection as the PPC for Maidstone and the Weald is evidence in many respects that that has happened.\"</p> <p>Like Cameron, Grant is excited by Barack Obama's \"message of hope and action and change\". Would she vote for him if she was American? She is hesitant to be seen endorsing a Democrat. \"If we're removing party politics completely - just the man, and what he has to offer, and what he's doing at the moment for America - I think he would make a very, very good president.\"</p> <p>I wonder whether she's ever thought of going all the way - of trying to become Britain's first black prime minister? She laughs. \"At the moment I've just got to be a hard-working prospective parliamentary candidate, getting elected and looking after the people of Maidstone and the Weald. That's the job and that's what I'm determined to do.\"</p>",
  "<p>The other week, I saw a film I can't get out of my head. I'm not sure that it's especially \"good\" in the sense of being flawlessly made. But it's a film about inescapable flaws. Sometimes a movie does the simplest thing film has to offer: it shows us something we have never quite seen or felt before; it shows us something that shocks and alarms us - and that doesn't have to be an ingredient from a horror picture, or something capable of fictional redemption. Horror can live in the mind of the beholder, and it can be an everyday thing. Let me try to describe Prodigal Sons to you.</p> <p>It's a family documentary, made by Kimberley Reed. She's about 40 now, a tall, striking woman who lives in New York and went to film school. But she was a boy once, the star quarterback on her high-school football team in Montana. So it seems to be a documentary about sexual change - except that Kimberley doesn't dwell on that experience. With her lover, another woman, she goes home to Montana to work out her family history.</p> <p>Her father was a doctor, and is dead, but her mother is alive, an earnest, retired teacher. In the early 60s, the couple believed they could not have children, so they adopted a boy named Marc. They got him at an adoption agency in Tacoma, Washington, when he was four weeks old. But then, quite quickly, the couple had two children of their own - Kimberley and a boy. The family grew up in Montana. Marc was the shortest of the children, the least successful in school, and maybe the most needy and resentful. He was afraid of not being the centre of attention, but he was a lively boy with a lot of friends and an inexplicable and untrained ability to sit at the piano and play any tune he heard.</p> <p>When Marc was 21 and living in southern Utah, he and some friends went on a drive to Las Vegas. There was a serious crash that left Marc in a coma for seven days. He had brain surgery. And about five years later he started to have grand mal seizures. The doctors felt these were tied to the accident, but they couldn't be sure. Marc was married and had a child, but his sense of having been cheated by life grew.</p> <p>One day, he decided to do what he could to trace his origins. He went back to Tacoma, and the agency found that they had permission to give him the names of his parents. The father was long since dead; I don't know his name. The mother was dead too, but more recently, and her name was Rebecca Welles. Rebecca was the daughter of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. Kimberley was staggered when she heard this news, because she was a film student who revered Welles. But the funny thing about Marc was that he hardly knew who his grandparents had been.</p> <p>I am confident that if I had known nothing about the background to Prodigal Sons, and if you had asked me to nominate Marc's grandfather, I would never have guessed correctly - and I have written a book about Orson Welles. But once you know, the brain is freed and memory and storytelling wash away \"fact\" in the way a wave erases writing in the sand. All of a sudden, Marc lurches across the screen like Hank Quinlan in Touch of Evil. In his repose, you see the strange babyface that lasted in Orson for 70 years. And when Marc explodes (because he is alarmingly full of anger), smashing a mirror and becoming violent, you see the terrible temper that so many witnesses reported in Orson. If you love Welles, for whatever reason, this documentary is an uncanny, haunting experience.</p> <p>In a Dickens novel, perhaps, Marc might become an actor. In life no such thing happens. He looks at DVDs of Welles movies but is not especially stirred. The thing that intrigues him is the ghostly physical resemblance - the feeling of kinship. Did Welles and Hayworth know of Marc's existence? Welles died in 1985, Hayworth in 1987. Rebecca Welles is someone we hardly know. Mobbed as a child by photographers, as an adult she retreated into private life. She led as quiet a life as she could in the Pacific northwest. She married twice, was largely out of touch with her father, and had Marc in 1966, immediately putting him up for adoption. Rebecca died in 2004, aged 59, and she and Marc never met after he was adopted.</p> <p>But there is another new Welles documentary, The Unknown Orson Welles, in which Marc says it was at Rita's urging that Rebecca put him up for adoption. He also claims his father killed himself when he realised he had lost the child. Is that Marc making himself centre of attention, or does it hint at an unknown life where maybe even Orson knew of Marc's existence?</p> <p>As Prodigal Sons proceeds, Marc becomes more agitated. He is in hospital for a time and on constant medication. He is alarming and endearing by turns, not because of his mishaps, but because of the mounting violence they are leading to. As with any family story where covers and polite lies are ripped aside, the viewer feels a dreadful fascination at what is shown. Kim goes back to New York to finish the film. She clearly has a rewarding life. As for Marc, he has not been rescued or saved - but what a sentimental suggestion it is in art and fiction to think that the wounded are saved.</p> <p>At one point, the family travel to Croatia to visit Oja Kodar, Welles' lover in the last 20 or so years of his life. Kodar had never heard of Marc's existence, but says Welles would have loved to know about a grandson because he yearned for male offspring (from three marriages, Orson had three daughters). When she looks at Marc's feet, she sees Orson - varicose veins, flat-footed awkwardness, a lack of exercise. It is another small genetic revelation. Kodar also notes that Orson's mother, Beatrice Ives Welles, was an accomplished pianist.</p> <p>So perhaps Welles never knew his grandson and Marc McKerrow is not especially interested in Welles. Still, for the third party in the triangle, the onlooker, the experience is not so simple. Of course, the story is proof of the power of damage or illness, and of the startling revelations of chance. Does Marc play the piano because of his great-grandmother, or is it coincidence? Is it sentimental to see him explode and to feel moments in Citizen Kane - where the tycoon, abandoned by a wife, smashes her room to pieces? Is it possible in play-acting that Orson came close to the mind of a grandson of whom he had no real knowledge? Or is this all territory to be observed more than explored?</p> <p>It may depend on how you feel about Welles, a man who neglected his children terribly because of his obsession with work, who had a brother (Richard) who seems to have been so eclipsed by Orson that it may have amounted to disturbance. No one ever accused Orson Welles of being mentally ill, not even in an age when his bi-polar tendencies seem more obvious or inescapable. There is so much in Citizen Kane to digest or remember. Many casual observers forget that Kane had a son, or how the son was killed - in a car crash. You can hardly think of two different things without living to discover their connection.</p>",
  "<p>Cuba is to charge a punk rocker today with \"social dangerousness\" because his songs denounce and deride the communist government. </p> <p>Gorki Aguila, lead singer of Porno para Ricardo, faces up to four years in prison for openly defying the revolution and scorning Fidel and Raul Castro as \"geriatrics\".</p> <p>The 39-year-old has been in police custody since Monday and was due to appear at the Playa municipal court in western Havana to be charged with subverting \"communist morality\".</p> <p>The case has triggered protests from artists and human rights groups.

  "<p>Mexico's supreme court yesterday upheld the capital's abortion law by dismissing a challenge brought by the conservative federal government by eight votes to three.</p> <p>The law, in effect since April last year, requires Mexico City health services to provide free terminations to any woman up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. </p> <p>The chief federal prosecutor and the national human rights ombudsman took the case to the supreme court, arguing that the constitution's guarantee of the right to life obliged the authorities to prioritise the protection of every unborn child, from the moment of conception, over a woman's right to choose. </p> <p>A formal vote by the 11 supreme court justices was delivered yesterday, but over the course of a televised discussion lasting several days, eight of the justices made clear they disagreed with the challenge.</p> <p>Along with Cuba, Mexico City has the most liberal abortion legislation in Latin America. Fearful of exposing divisions in a country that values its anticlerical political tradition as deeply as its Catholic heritage, politicians and bishops had avoided the abortion question for decades. </p> <p>The laws of most Mexican states allow terminations in cases of rape, risk to the mother's life or severe foetal deformities. In practice almost no states offer abortions in such cases. However, nor do they prosecute the doctors who offer safe illegal abortions or the cheaper life-threatening backstreet practitioners. </p> <p>Many thought this compromise would end when the Catholic conservative National Action party won the 2000 general election, after 71 years of rule by the nominally progressive Institutional Revolutionary party. But the right remained wary and it was left to the capital's leftwing authority to pass legislation. </p> <p>Feminists want abortion on demand across Mexico.

  "<p>The flock of Black Welsh Mountain sheep kept on land at the bottom of Chavenage Lane always hold my interest as I pass on my morning bicycle ride. Ken, their owner, sought my advice this morning, knowing that we had experience of the breed and had sourced them from the same home flock - that of Sally, Dowager Duchess of Westminster, at Wickwar. Ken wanted advice on the respective qualities of two ram lambs, and on local slaughterhouse facilities. I never knew how the Eastington premises, run by a small, local butcher, had avoided Euro legislation for it is just the sort of small, friendly slaughterhouse which seemed to be victimised in the interest of massive regional facilities that lack humanity and involve long journeys for livestock. </p> <p>I was able to tell Ken that we had been able to leave our lambs in a quiet orchard pasture on Sunday nights; they were killed at 9am on Monday, sheepskins could be collected on Tuesday afternoon, and freezer packs of lamb, butchered for the size you specified, could be collected on Thursday. In terms of the compassionate stewardship of animals you had bred and knew, this seemed as good as it gets, and Ken shares the same responsible attitude as we felt over our 10 years with a flock. On the ram lambs - one of which will replace the current ram, Mario, who is getting on a bit - I could only advise that the one closest to his father in conformation would be my choice. Ken knows that you cannot run the risk of leaving two rams with a small flock as tupping time approaches for they will fight, with repeated head-to-head charges, for rights to the ewes. We made the mistake once, and it took a morning, and the help of a neighbour, to separate two Soay rams, father and son. </p> <p>Apart from the photo on the wall of us with our prize-winning ram, Gladstone, our nicest reminder of the flock are the sheepskins beside the beds at the Breton fastness - the brown-and-white ones of Jacobs ram lambs being long since recycled.</p>",
  "<p>Gary McKinnon, the British hacker who embarrassed the Pentagon and Nasa by entering their computer systems from a flat in north London, has lost his long battle against extradition. Yesterday it was announced that he has been unsuccessful in his appeal to the European court of human rights and must now submit himself for trial in the US.</p> <p>This is more than just depressing news for McKinnon, a genial soul who is guilty of having an insatiable curiosity and a mischievous nature but certainly not of threatening the security of the US, as its prosecuting authorities have speciously suggested. It is also depressing news for people who believe that the courts of this country have a duty to protect their citizens' rights.</p> <p>By a remarkable coincidence, McKinnon's case is back in the news at the same time as that of Binyam Mohamed, the British citizen currently held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he was taken in 2004 after, he claims, having been tortured in Morocco and Afghanistan into making confessions. Over the past 10 days, the high court in London has been hearing evidence about the secrecy that has surrounded the rendition of Mohamed, the suggestion that he was tortured by having his penis cut with a razorblade and the fact that the US authorities have been unwilling to surrender the details of his confinement to the lawyers who are attempting to defend him, when he is eventually granted a trial, more than six years after he was arrested.</p> <p>No one is suggesting McKinnon is in line for such treatment, although the fact that one member of the prosecuting team in the US has admitted he would like to \"see him fry\" hardly encourages hopes of a fair and rational trial in the US.</p> <p>When the law lords brushed aside McKinnon's appeal to them recently, they declared that \"the difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellant's argument suggests\". But they delivered their judgment before the high court heard about the disturbing behaviour of the US prosecutorial process in the case of Mohamed. </p> <p>What the Mohamed case has shown is that, when it comes to cases of supposed national security, all bets are off. McKinnon is not trying to dodge responsibility for his action. Both he and his lawyers have always indicated that he is prepared to stand trial in this country, where the alleged offence was committed. That offer was repeated again yesterday, alongside the information that McKinnon has been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome. The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, has now been invited to initiate a prosecution here which would remove the necessity for McKinnon to be deported to the US. This must be the sanest solution.</p> <p>In the Mohamed case this week, the US state department warned the UK of \"serious and lasting damage to the US-UK intelligence-sharing relationship\" if details of his interrogation and incarceration were disclosed to his lawyers. It is time to assert the rights of citizens to enjoy a fair trial, free from bogus security innuendo, and maybe for the Home Office to warn of the potential \"serious and lasting damage\" to the relationship by the US's pursuit of a harmless hacker. </p> <p>The only significant part of the US defence establishment to have suffered any damage as a result of McKinnon's intrusions has been its ego, which has admittedly received a bruising since he deposited the suggestion that its security system was \"crap\", nearly a decade ago. The UK government has been accused of failure to punch its weight on the international stage. What a wonderful opportunity Jacqui Smith now has to argue McKinnon's case to stand trial here and to show that, in any relationship, it takes two to tango, whatever tune the military band may be playing.<br><a href=\"mailto:duncan.campbell@theguardian.com\"><br>duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Faced by the disconcerting rise of David Cameron, Labour politicians and the leftist commentariat have rediscovered one of the oldest tropes in the rhetorical armoury of self-styled progressives. Cameron, we are told on all sides, is a phoney. His honeyed words conceal sour intentions. He may talk the talk of harmony and cohesion, but he won't - can't - walk the walk. He is, after all, a Tory; and a Tory toff at that. If he gets into power, his amiable mask will slip. Before we know what has happened, we shall be back in the bad old days of Thatcher and Major. That dreaded animal, the free market, will run riot. The state will be trimmed. Public spending will be cut. Welfare will be squeezed. The rich will get richer and the poor will rot.</p> <p>To those with long memories, this sounds strangely familiar. The battered, bankrupt Attlee government said much the same in its dying years. Labour candidates fought the 1950 and 1951 elections on the less than inspiring slogan: \"Ask your dad\". The reformist Conservatism patented by Lord Woolton and RA Butler after the 1945 election, they proclaimed, was a wicked con: if the Tories returned to office, the reforms of Attlee's government would be undone; Beveridge and Keynes would be consigned to history's dustbin; mass unemployment, poverty and degradation, would return; the welfare state would be crippled. </p> <p>Needless to say, nothing of the sort happened. The Conservative governments of the 1950s can fairly be criticised for industrial featherbedding and trade union appeasement. But with trivial modifications, it left Labour's economic and social legacy in being.</p> <p>The welfare state flourished. Unemployment oscillated between a high of 2.1% and a low of 1.2% - figures that Keynes and his associates would have thought inconceivably low. Real wages rose. Economic growth was low by mainland European standards, but high by previous British levels. Social spending increased absolutely and held its share of GDP. The net effect of the tax and welfare system was to make household incomes slightly less unequal. On house building, the government's record far surpassed Labour's. The frontiers of social citizenship and the public domain were as wide as they had been before the Conservative victory. Of the Attlee government's nationalisations, only steel and road haulage were reversed. Continuity with the recent past, not reversion to a more remote one, was the new regime's chief hallmark.</p> <p>There were obvious political reasons for sticking to the Attlee settlement. A return to the prewar years, the Conservative leaders believed, would spell electoral suicide. But there were deeper reasons as well. The Conservative governments of the 1950s (and, for that matter, the 1960s) belonged to a deeply rooted and astonishingly successful Whig-imperialist political tradition that went back to one of the most fertile thinkers ever to sit in the House of Commons, Edmund Burke. </p> <p>Burke summed up the essence of the tradition in a phrase: statesmen, he wrote, should combine a \"disposition to preserve\" with an \"ability to improve\". Headlong change, based on a priori theorising, could lead to disaster, but so could rigid adherence to the legacy of the past. True statesmanship was a matter of sensing intuitively when the time had come to tack. Butler, one of the canniest Whig imperialists of the postwar period, said much the same nearly two centuries later. The tradition that had formed him, he wrote, was \"neither fixed nor finished\". It was \"responsive to the demands of each new age\" and, above all, \"empirical as to method\". </p> <p>This Whig imperialist tradition reigned for most of the 19th century, and virtually the entire interwar period. In the 19th century it shaped the three great reform acts that slowly widened the suffrage from about 9% of the adult male population to 60%. In the 20th, it suffused the irenic statecraft of that quintessential Whig imperialist, Stanley Baldwin, who sought to \"get at the soul of the working people\" with a mixture of inclusive rhetoric, social reform and industrial collaboration. Thanks largely to him, the fires of class conflict that had raged in the early 1920s were damped down; thanks to his reforming health minister, and later chancellor, Neville Chamberlain, the embryonic welfare state bequeathed by the Liberal government of 1905-14 developed lustily. </p> <p>The Whig imperialists of the 50s and 60s followed where Baldwin and Chamberlain had led. Left-Labour puritans scorned Harold Macmillan's boast that the British had \"never had it so good\" as a piece of vulgar huckstering, and in a way they were right. But it was also justified testimony to a decade of rising living standards and growing social contentment that would have made the great Whig imperialists of the 19th century rejoice. (Burke would have winced at the language, but I suspect he too would have applauded the achievement.)</p> <p>We can't know if Cameron will become a second Baldwin, Butler or Macmillan, but there is not much doubt that he would like to. Of course, he will not be a clone of his Whig imperialist predecessors. He aspires to govern a different country, with a different class system and economic structure; and he has learned a great deal from that magician of ambiguous populism, Tony Blair. The fact remains that his style and rhetoric echo the Whig imperialist style and rhetoric of the past. He offers inclusion, social harmony and evolutionary adaptation to the cultural and socioeconomic changes of his age: a 21st century equivalent of the amalgam of preservation and improvement once lauded by Burke. </p> <p>Labour's paladins are barking up precisely the wrong tree in charging him with crypto-Thatcherism. The crystalline, divisive purity of Thatcher's Tory nationalist vision is alien to him. Where she sought to haul the country out of the path it had followed for almost 60 years, Cameron is running with the grain of the troubled times we live in. His anti-statist rhetoric and talk of a \"broken society\" may shock the left commentariat, but they resonate powerfully in a nation that has grown tired of endless chivvying by Whitehall, and where the shards of vanished civilities lie all around us. </p> <p>One of the great questions of the age is how to protect the precious filaments of civil society from the pressures of resurgent capitalism, hyper-individualism, resentful populism, family breakdown and state encroachment. Cameron has not found the answer, but he has realised there is a problem. I think he has also realised that the feverish social engineering beloved of old Thatcherite and New Labour policy wonks is part of the problem, and that lasting social and cultural changes have to grow from the bottom instead of being imposed from the top. </p> <p>Against that background, Labour talk of a leadership change is not just petty and mean-minded; it is sublimely irrelevant. The question that matters is whether it can retrieve the non-statist democratic republican strand in its heritage - exemplified by John Milton, John Stuart Mill, Tom Mann and RH Tawney - and abandon the heavyhanded, statist democratic collectivism that has been second nature to Labour governments since the 1920s. There is still time.

  "<p><strong>Armed forces are almost 6,000 below strength</strong></p> <p>The armed forces are almost 6,000 personnel below strength, according to Ministry of Defence figures published yesterday.

The army had a 3,500 shortfall, the Royal Navy was 1,220 under strength and the RAF 1,070 below the required total. The total number of service personnel required has dropped by almost 12,000 since 2005, when the forces were 3,000 below strength.

ContactPoint, a \u00a3224m computer system carrying personal information on all under-18s, was due online in April. The date was then put back to October after concerns about data security following the loss of child benefit data by Revenue and Customs. Shadow families minister Maria Miller said: \"This looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <p><strong>18 Royal Navy sailors test positive for cocaine</strong></p> <p>Eighteen sailors on a Royal Navy warship have tested positive for a class A drug, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. The crewmen were caught during routine testing on board the destroyer HMS Liverpool, which is deployed in the South Atlantic. An MoD spokeswoman said the drug involved was cocaine and internal disciplinary action was being taken. The breach is believed to be the biggest in the navy's history and comes after five soldiers from the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery were dismissed for taking cocaine. Eight from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers failed a drug test in July. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <p><strong>Mayor urged to act over axed model health tests</strong></p> <p>Boris Johnson is being asked to withdraw funding from the British Fashion Council after it announced it was ditching plans to force models to undergo health checks before taking to the catwalk at London fashion week. The London Development Agency recently gave the BFC \u00a34.2m to raise the profile of the twice-yearly event. Dee Doocey, a Liberal Democrat London assembly member, is to demand the public funding be cut at Johnson's first mayor's question time on September 10 after the BFC said it would not now require models to provide a doctor's certificate proving they were healthy. <br><strong>Helen Pidd</strong></p> <p><strong>Jury sees video of police shooting bank raiders</strong></p> <p>Footage of the moment police marksmen shot dead two bank raiders was shown at Kingston crown court yesterday. Jurors watched a covert surveillance video showing Mark Nunes, 35, being shot as he held a gun to the head of a security guard outside HSBC bank in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire. As his accomplice Andrew Markland, 36, tries to pick up the weapon he too is shot. The deaths ended an 18-month crime spree in which a gang raided at least 18 security vans in the south of England. In court yesterday, evidence began in the trial of four men accused of being members of the criminal ring. <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <p><strong>Potential child bullies identified in survey</strong></p> <p>A quarter of eight- to-10-year-olds lack healthy friendships and are more likely than their peers to be victims of bullies and bullies themselves, government-funded research revealed yesterday. Such children are more prone to depression and may often have had language and behaviour problems from an early age, according to the study of 6,500 pupils in the west of England. Fewer than 1% of all children in the age group may be \"true bullies\" having never been on the receiving end themselves, said researchers at the Institute of Education, London. <br><strong>James Meikle</strong></p> <p><strong>Seabed work starts on man-made surf reef</strong></p> <p>Europe's first artificial surf reef was being laid on the seabed off Boscombe, Dorset, yesterday after delays caused by gales, rain and high waves.

  "<p>It is my first and last day at sewage school. The premises are nothing much to look at, consisting of a Portakabin in the car park of Barston, a small sewage-treatment works near Birmingham. This classroom is one of five run by Severn Trent, one of the 10 utilities that supply clean drinking water and remove dirty water for the people of England and Wales. The education programme is fully funded by the utility in an attempt to reveal its vital job to a public that doesn't pay it mind. They think it's a good investment. </p> <p>Today's class comes from a nearby primary school. After a brief trot through the water cycle and some green lessons - washing a car with a hosepipe uses nine litres of water a minute, children, so use buckets - the sewage pupils put on their wellies for the tour. First, the influent, brown water rushing in from the sewers, visible through a hole in the ground. Then the compactor that crunches up objects screened by grills. It's not moving, sir, they say, but it is, spitting out in slow-motion rags and pen caps and hundreds of the yellow sweetcorn kernels that humans can't digest, prized by picnicking birds. </p> <p>Wastewater treatment is much-tinkered-with - 1,000 works will have 999 different processes, a worker tells me - but the basics are unchangeable. Solids are removed from sewage first by filtering and letting them sink. This is primary treatment. Secondary treatment involves micro-organisms, bolstered by added oxygen, that break down any organic content still in the wastewater. The bacteria-cleaned effluent goes into a nearby stream. The children lean over obediently to look at its colour. It's clear! Not brown! And then it's time to make sewage soup. </p> <p>It has been a long time since sewage consisted of pure human faecal material. Into sewage, anything goes. An enterprising American sewage-treatment manager once expressed this by producing water bottles supposedly made from sewage effluent. Their labels listed the ingredients: water, faecal matter, toilet paper, hair, lint, rancid grease, stomach acid and trace amounts of Pepto Bismol, chocolate, urine, body oils, dead skin, industrial chemicals (aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, chromium, nickel, molybdenum, selenium, silver, arsenic, mercury) ammonia, soil, laundry soap, bath soap, shaving cream, sweat, saliva, salt, sugar. </p> <p>So the ingredients of sewage soup are a tankful of water and whatever else the class might have put down the sink, toilet, gutter or drain that day. The children suggest shampoo, soap, toothpaste, washing powder, rice and salt, which the teacher adds into a tankful of water. \"Number one\" is lime cordial. \"Number two\" is soggy Weetabix. The rest of the lesson involves filtering the filth out of the water, in an attempt to impart the difficulty - and dubious sanity - of the paradigm of waterborne waste treatment in modern industrialised societies, whereby you take clean drinking water, throw filth into it, then spend millions to clean it again. My team gets a passable liquid from the filtering. They are pleased. But no one has considered the stuff that's been filtered. No one mentions the sludge. </p> <p>When sewage is cleaned and treated, the dirt that is removed is called sewage sludge. The UK produces 1.44m tonnes of it a year, and it has to go somewhere. The most common options consist of incineration, landfill, application to farmland and dumping at sea. The EU banned ocean dumping in 1998, as the nutrients in human waste - nitrogen and phosphorous, for a start - can, in great quantities, suffocate the life from water. The public doesn't much like incineration, and landfill space is running out. So 68% of our sludge is applied to fields, a fact that translated into newspaper headlines last month as \"human sewage [is] used for our cereals,\" beside a photograph of a woman eating cornflakes. Reader reaction was predictable. One commenter swore never to shop at supermarkets again. Another pronounced the practice \"disgusting\". </p> <p>But on the forum of Farmers Weekly, the farmers let rip. \"It's great stuff,\" wrote one, \"and probably better than the raw cow muck that goes on.\" The public's horror was yet another reason that \"the general public, and the media, should not be allowed out on farms ... without serious education beforehand\". In fact, sludge used as fertiliser isn't news. Nor is it going away, given the rising price of artificial fertilisers. Severn Trent reports a 25% increase in demand from farmers since January. Anglian Water has a waiting list. And why not? Sludge contains nitrogen and phosphorous, which farmers and crops love. It's often given away free, and it saves farmers about \u00a3450 per hectare that they would otherwise spend on fertiliser. Water UK, an association of the water utilities, reckons 3,000 farmers - out of 146,000 in total - use sludge each year, applying it to all kinds of arable land. </p> <p>Nor is it unusual. Human waste has been used to fertilise fields for thousands of years. China's willingness to use untreated sewage on its fields is probably the reason its soil is still fertile after 4,000 years of cultivation, when other civilisations such as the Maya watched their crops wither and their soil erode. A recent report by the International Water Management Institute calculated that 200 million farmers worldwide were using raw sewage to irrigate their crops. </p> <p>Properly treated, sewage could have a place in the nutrient cycle. Food feeds humans whose waste feeds food. And sludge is not raw sewage, which can carry at least 50 communicable diseases. It is treated and regulated (the better stuff has to have 99.9999% of pathogens, including salmonella, removed; the lower-quality sludge has to have 99%). Heavy metals are also regulated, as are harvesting and sowing times (farmers must wait 30 months before sowing vegetables after using lower-quality sludge, for example). In principle, it makes perfect sense. The British government considers sludge as fertiliser \"the best practicable environmental option\". Steve Ntifo of Water UK is convinced that sludge is safe \"subject to regulation\".</p> <p>But in the US, where 3m tonnes of sludge are applied to farmland, an increasingly vocal anti-sludge movement doesn't agree. Though sludge has been rebranded \"biosolids\" (after a naming competition that also produced \"bioslurp\" and \"black gold\"), the debate over its use has become controversial and bitter. It has involved lawsuits, high politics, secret settlements and scores of allegations of illness. Some of those allegations have come from a quiet corner of North Carolina, from a picture-postcard small white bungalow opposite unremarkable brown fields. The house is owned by Nancy Holt, a retired nurse, whose family have farmed in this area for 250 years. The fields, Holt thinks, are killing her. </p> <p>I visited Holt on a hot August day last year. She greeted me with a hug and a cold flannel for my head, then sat me down at the kitchen table and prepared the weapons of the grassroots protester: piles of files, dossiers, reports and a scientific vocabulary that she has accumulated along with frustration and disbelief. The year before, she told me, sludge was applied for 33 days straight to the fields. \"Based on the number of 6,000-gallon tankers that came to apply it, we came up with the best guess that 9.75m gallons [were] spread on 160 acres. They were doing it 12 hours a day and a truck would arrive every 10 minutes.\" That was when Holt went blind. She wasn't a well woman to begin with. When I'd called to make the appointment, she'd apologised for misunderstanding something by saying, \"I have holes in my head.\" I took it as a joke, but she does have holes in her head, after surgery which left her with metal clamps in her brain. One time when the sludge was applied - it's been arriving twice a year, spring and summer, for 13 years - the arteries in her brain swelled, pressed on her optic nerve and temporarily took away her sight. The diagnosis was the blood-vessel disorder, giant cell arteritis, but no cause was proven. Holt is sure the cause was the sludge, and she now spends much of her life trying to prove it. </p> <p>The trouble began in the creeks. In 2001, Holt's grandson and great-nephew were diagnosed with staphylococcus aureus (\"staph\"), a bacterial infection usually associated with dirty hospitals, and most famous for its antibiotic-resistant superbug strain MRSA. She noticed that they fell sick after playing in the streams running behind the house. Then a local dog fell ill to flesh-eating bacteria. Then someone organised a fundraiser for a couple who both had cancer, and people started taking a tally of incidents. The Cook family: three daughters with breast cancer. The Hoffmans: a mother with colon cancer, a father with prostate cancer and a 13-year-old son with testicular cancer. Five cases of brain cancer in a community of 38 families. Holt started to keep records. </p> <p>She made a list of health problems associated with exposure to applied sludge that included \"increased respiratory distress or breathing difficulties; diarrhoea (chronic during sludge applications, all ages); chronic and acute headaches (persistent after exposure to odours, relieved by leaving residence); staph infections (children covered by staph sores after playing in creeks or streams after significant rains); presumed neurotoxin sensitivity (seizures, nausea, elevated blood pressure, and rash).\"</p> <p>In this, she wasn't alone. Another sludge activist called Helane Shields had compiled a dossier of complaints 500 pages thick. The Waste Management Institute at Cornell University, directed by Professor Ellen Harrison, has gathered 350 sludge-related health complaints, and lists characteristic symptoms as: asthma, flu-like symptoms, eye irritations, lesions, immuno-deficiency, nosebleeds, burning eyes, throat or nose. </p> <p>Nancy began to read the literature, including news stories about the work of Dr Tyrone Hayes, who found that frogs were being deformed by mixtures of pesticides, even when individual pesticides were well within legal limits. She handed me articles about the transmission of prions - infectious agents linked to BSE - from funeral-home waste, and about outbreaks of e-coli in Californian spinach. She talked at top speed about antibiotics in the sewage, and how only the strongest and fittest survive and that if we wanted to create superbugs, we couldn't do better. She didn't let up for two hours, and by the end was still running on indignation. </p> <p>People who promote and supply biosolids, depending on how courteous they are, tend to dismiss opponents such as Holt as anything from over-emotive to hysterical. Cranks. Nimbyists. The problem, they say, is about smell, not science. Humans have learned to avoid what is dangerous, and faeces can be lethal. Faecal aversion, one wastewater treatment manager told me, is clouding risk perception. He showed me a bottle of vitamins which contained the heavy metal selenium. \"You'd have to eat 212 pounds of our biosolids to get what your body needs.\"</p> <p>But criticism of sludge has come from quarters that no one could call over-emotive. Robert Swank, a senior Environmental Protection Agency official, testified to the US Senate in 2000 that US regulations \"don't pass scientific muster\". In 2002, a senior EPA microbiologist called Dr David Lewis led a University of Georgia study that analysed 53 incidents where health issues had been reported near sludge sites, and found a puzzlingly high incidence of staph infections. Lewis thought chemical irritants in sludge may be causing lesions that allowed staph easy access to the bloodstream. He told reporters: \"In my opinion, the land-spreading of sludge is a serious problem. We have mixed together pathogens with a wide variety of chemicals that are known to enhance the infection process. It makes people more susceptible to infections.\" Taking excrement from hundreds of thousands of people, mixing it and spreading it on land is simply \"not a good idea\". Not long afterwards, he was fired. </p> <p>The Harper-Collins Dictionary of Environmental Science defines sludge as \"a viscous, semi-solid mixture of bacteria and virus-laden organic matter, toxic metals, synthetic organic chemicals and settled solids removed from domestic industrial wastewater at a sewage-treatment plant\". The Clean Water Act keeps it simple and calls it a pollutant. Critics don't just object to possible risks to human health: Ellen Harrison of Cornell University, a soil scientist by training, also worries about the health of soil. In a paper entitled \"The Case for Caution\", she pointed out that \"lead used by Romans persists in the soil two millennia later\". </p> <p>Of course soil science is extremely complex, and long-term tests run by Defra looking at metals in sludge-applied land have found no cause for concern. Even so, Switzerland - which used to land-apply 40% of its sludge - has banned the practice because of fears from farmers that it was harming their soil. The Netherlands has banned agricultural use of sludge, and national farmers' associations in France, Germany, Sweden, Luxembourg and Finland are against it, partly because of concerns about organic contaminants such as PCBs and brominated flame retardants (linked to liver and neurodevelopmental toxicity and hormone disruption), which some research has shown persist in sludge. </p> <p>Food retailers Del Monte, Kraft and Heinz won't accept produce grown on sludge-fertilised fields. EU organic regulations - which are followed by all UK organic certification bodies - won't allow it, even though the principle of closing the nutrient cycle is one that is dear to organic hearts. </p> <p>Ntifo attributes the Swiss ban to \"a powerful incineration lobby\". Opposition from food retailers, meanwhile, is about \"a perception of perceptions\". Food retailers worry what their customers think. \"They are calculating their commercial risk. It's not about the science.\" Water UK states that \"there has never been a recorded outbreak of human ill health in the UK as a result of the practice of recycling biosolids to land.\" </p> <p>I don't know who is right. But I see the certainty of the sludge industry, and I think of a different century when engineering and science began to have inordinate confidence, which was expressed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette during an 1870 inquiry into the pollution of the Thames. The vicar of Barking and 123 of his neighbours had objected to Bazalgette's practice of discharging all London's sewage into the river. Bazalgette, called to the inquiry, showed himself to be as sure of himself as the biosolids promoters of today. The possibility that the river was being polluted was, he asserted, \"entirely imaginary and contrary to the fact\". Eight years later, the Princess Alice steamboat collided with a dredger near the outfall, and more than 600 people died. Survivors reported that they could not swim in such noxious waters, and that they vomited copiously. The outfalls were closed 20 years later. It is not recorded whether Bazalgette ever admitted he had been wrong. </p> <p>PCBs were considered safe for decades. So was DDT. In the US, the most authoritative document on sludge is still a 2002 report by the National Academy of Sciences, which concluded that \"there is no documented scientific evidence that the Part 503 rules [which govern biosolids use] have failed to protect public health\". But opponents quote the following sentence instead because it reads: \"However, additional scientific work is needed to reduce persistent uncertainty about the potential for adverse human health effects from exposure to biosolids.\" The sentences are quoted endlessly because, in Harrison's view, \"there is a dearth of investigation in this area\". Those two sentences are the scraps that each side fights the other over. In between, there is space for speculation and fear. </p> <p>In the US, the fate of the biosolids industry may be decided by lawyers. Though three deaths of young men allegedly from sludge-linked staph infections didn't reach court (one was settled by Synagro, a sludge-applying giant now owned by the Carlyle Group), those of cows have. In 2006, a Georgia court awarded damages to a dairy farmer when 30% of his cattle died after eating sludge-applied hay, 10 times the normal mortality rate. An Associated Press investigation found that levels of thallium - a metal that can cause nerve damage - in the herd's milk were 120 times those allowed in drinking water (and that the milk was still sold for human consumption). This year, Judge Anthony Alaimo of Georgia found that another dairy farm had been acutely contaminated by sludge. Scientific data supplied by the municipality of Augusta that claimed to prove the safety of biosolids was, the judge declared, \"unreliable, incomplete and in some cases fudged\". </p> <p>Are biosolids safe? \"I am always hesitant to answer that,\" says Eric Davis, the land application manager for Burlington, North Carolina, which supplies the biosolids that are spread on the fields near Holt, \"because safe means something to some folks and something else to others. That doesn't mean we're trying to hide anything. If safety means compliance with the letter of the law, then our biosolids are safe. There are a finite number of constituents we can test for: outside those, you're in the realm of unknowns. We're always trying to figure out the next step. We're willing to change as technology changes.\" </p> <p>This wouldn't comfort the lone voice of opposition on the Farmers Weekly forum. Though in the minority, he was forthright. \"I won't have sludge on my land. The heavy metals just sit in the plough layer waiting until someone realises there are long-term problems for animals, crops and us. I honestly believe that all those who [use sludge] will live to regret it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Rose George is the author of The Big Necessity: Adventures in the World of Human Waste, published by Portobello Books on Monday priced \u00a312.99</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday October 22 2008.

  "<p>At university Jamal Hirani failed his first year in maths three times. Years later, he was spurned by James Caan, the multimillionaire British-Asian entrepreneur from Dragons' Den. But the Tiffinbites founder is not one to give up easily. </p> <p>Despite Caan's decision, Hirani's restaurant chain - which he describes as an Indian Wagamama - has grown into a multimillion-pound business from humble beginnings as a takeaway in Moorgate, London, five years ago. It was modelled on India's \"tiffin wallahs\", who whisk home-cooked food stored in tiffin boxes to offices at lunchtime.</p> <p>Having snapped up Indian chains Vama Group and Bombay Bicycle Club - known as Gordon Ramsay's favourite takeaway - Tiffinbites claims to be Britain's largest Indian restaurant group in a highly fragmented market. It runs four restaurants and seven takeaways under the Tiffinbites name, and has added three Bombay Bicycle Club restaurants and 14 takeaways, as well as Vama Group's top-end restaurant, airline catering and a corporate event and wedding catering arm. Its main competitor is Masala World, which runs five Masala Zone and three upmarket restaurants.</p> <p>Tiffinbites has plans to expand the chain across the country to 50 outlets by the end of next year under a rapid franchise programme. Well known in London's Square Mile, Tiffinbites also takes over the canteens of 350 blue-chip companies including HSBC, Morgan Stanley and the BBC on Wednesdays - feeding 250,000 workers through a contract with Compass Group.</p> <p>In 2003, Hirani privately presented his business idea to Caan. \"Like most people, he didn't believe Indian food could be eaten at lunchtime,\" he says. \"He kicks himself every time now.\"</p> <p>The food is served in traditional tiffins - round aluminium containers, usually stacked and containing individual portions of meat and vegetable curry dishes, bread and rice, chutney and daal. According to Hirani, the Tiffinbites food emulates traditional tiffin boxes not just in the way it is packaged but in being cooked the home-made way. It uses little oil and no ghee, lean meat and freshly ground spices.</p> <p>On a busy day, the restaurant in Canary Wharf does more than 1,000 covers - \"which is phenomenal in the restaurant industry - a good restaurant will do 150 covers,\" Hirani says. \"We're not a restaurant where you go for an intimate dinner.\" Despite the fast turnover, he stresses, \"we're not a tandoori restaurant. In tandoori restaurants you won't find a single Indian customer.\" By contrast, 40% of Tiffinbites' clientele are Indian. And 60% are women, attracted by the food's healthy, \"less than 10% fat\" label. It counts Shilpa Shetty, the Bollywood actress, and the EastEnders cast among its customers. </p> <p><strong>Inspired</strong></p> <p>Describing traditional curry houses in Britain, Hirani says: \"They make one large sauce, boil the meat and if you want a korma and I want a madras, the same chicken and the same sauce is used, but you would have a bit of cream in yours and I'd have a bit of chilli in mine, it's served within 10-15 minutes, and that's where the Indian food market was developed.\"</p> <p>Tiffinbites prides itself on its authentic Indian cuisine. \"A lot of the recipes are inspired by my mum, like the samosas,\" Hirani said. \"We're not a fusion restaurant - you won't find scallops or quails.\" His mother still spends time developing new dishes with the executive chef, Vishal, who trained with the Taj group in Kerala, famed for its south Indian food.</p> <p>Hirani admits that five years ago, the concept of Indian food at lunchtime was \"unheard of\" as it was deemed too heavy and greasy. But he did his research, tested the idea in Soho and moved on to the City, which he regards as the \"obvious lunchtime market\". He is unfazed by the worsening economic climate. Yes, raw material prices have shot up - rice has doubled in price and Tiffinbites gets through 10 tonnes of rice a week. \"There's been a huge impact,\" Hirani admits. But the group books its ingredients 12 months in advance, and tight cost control and greater economies of scale - with more acquisitions planned - are expected to see the group through the downturn. All the food is cooked in Brent Cross, north London, and sent out several times a day.</p> <p>Tiffinbites has resisted the temptation to put up its prices, and like others in the casual dining market (such as Carluccio's and Wagamama), benefits from cash-strapped consumers trading down. Its takeaways and canteen business have seen a rise in demand as people eat out less. \"One of the reasons for us buying Bombay Bicycle Club was that more people are staying in and having a takeaway.\" The chain's sales rose 10% over the last six weeks.</p> <p>The higher end of the restaurant market is undoubtedly suffering, and that includes the group's Vama fine dining restaurant on King's Road, London.</p> <p>Born in Kampala, Uganda, into an Indian family thrown out by dictator Idi Amin, Hirani moved to north London aged eight. There he had an early taste of the family food business. Every day after school there would be a 50lb bag of potatoes waiting to be peeled by him from which his mother made traditional Indian snacks for local shops.</p> <p>Having given up on his maths degree at Cardiff University, he got his first job with Encyclopedia Britannica, where he became sales manager for the south-west. With a business degree from Aston University, he joined Marks &amp; Spencer and advanced from store manager to lingerie buyer. There he met his former business partner, Jonathan Marks - Hirani bought bras and Marks knickers. </p> <p>M&amp;S taught him about products. \"A lady's bra is made out of 26 different components - it's all about learning how to make a product and ensuring it's the best product of the highest quality. I built my business around a lot of the ethos of Marks &amp; Spencer, which is about never compromising on quality, high customer service and running a business very tightly.\"</p> <p><strong>Passion</strong></p> <p>With the Tiffinbites concept in mind, Hirani left M&amp;S to work at Pricerunner.com, and bought a list from its profile database to conduct research among 1,000 young City workers. After 48% of those polled said they would go for Indian at lunchtime he quit his job and spent six months observing customers in Starbucks and Pret before presenting his business plan to investors.</p> <p>Teaming up with Marks, he raised \u00a3160,000 and put \u00a3190,000 into the venture himself after remortgaging his house. Marks left in 2005 to pursue his property interests. Since then, the company has raised more than \u00a310m in capital and first turned a profit in 2006. It makes annual profits of \u00a33m and has a turnover of \u00a324m, which is expected to rise to \u00a360m over the next 5 years.</p> <p>Tiffinbites has never used advertising but relies on word of mouth and its supper clubs to which regular customers are invited to evaluate new dishes.</p> <p>While retaining his passion for Indian food - every Saturday night he cooks at home for friends - Hirani spends little time in the restaurants these days. His main occupation is looking at new sites and vetting local entrepreneurs to run franchised outlets. The firm is opening in Dubai this year and is close to signing a partnership deal in India.</p> <p>Every lunchtime in Mumbai, 200,000 tiffin boxes are delivered. Tiffinbites is up to 50,000 a week. \"My ambition is to get to 200,000 a day - then I'll be a happy man, and hopefully a rich man at the same time,\" he laughs.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> 13 October 1967 in Kampala, Uganda; moved to Britain with his family in 1976</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Cardiff University <strong>1986</strong> where he abandoned maths degree </p> <p><strong>1992-1995</strong> Aston University, Birmingham, Business &amp; Managerial Studies</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Encyclopaedia Britannica, divisional sales manager <strong>1989-1992</strong></p> <p><strong>1995-2000</strong> Marks &amp; Spencer, store manager then buyer</p> <p><strong>2000-2002</strong> Pricerunner.com, managing director</p> <p><strong>2003</strong> Launches Tiffinbites and becomes its chief executive</p> <p><strong>2004</strong> Opens first restaurant in Canary Wharf, London</p> <p><strong>2008</strong> Franchises Tiffinbites</p> <p>Acquires Bombay Bicycle Club and Vama Group, making parent company, the Gourmet Restaurant Group, the largest Indian restaurant group in Britain</p> <p><strong>Lives</strong> Bromley, Kent, with his wife and three children</p>",
  "<p>Children who receive a rich variety of home learning before they start school achieve better results in maths tests at 10, according to a government-funded study into childhood learning. </p> <p>The researchers said the benefits of reading to children, playing with numbers and shapes, teaching them nursery rhymes and taking them to the library were detectable in addition to the influence of their parents' wealth and level of education. The study also found that children who attended quality preschool education did better at 10. </p> <p>Professor Edward Melhuish at Birkbeck, University of London, who led the research said the results showed that a combination of a good home learning environment, good preschool education and a good primary school were all important for later results.</p> <p>He said that without these benefits an average child from a poor background would be in the bottom 20% at school, but with all three advantages it would, on average, move into the top 20%.</p> <p>\"There are plenty of mothers who aren't very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who don't provide such a good home environment,\" Melhuish said.</p> <p>The study followed nearly 3,000 children at more than 800 primary schools from three onwards.

  "<p>According to Deborah Hargreaves a \"windfall tax would only scare off investors\" (Comment, August 27). Another way of looking at it is that energy companies want to scare off the government. There are no downsides to a windfall tax. Energy companies rely on supplying a UK market - they cannot up sticks and move elsewhere. They are enjoying record profits and it is fair that these should help cushion the cost of rising fuel bills. They will invest in future energy supplies because they think they will make future profits. In a period of economic hardship it is only right that the super-rich and super-profits should bear a heavier burden. If business attacks the government for levying a windfall tax, the voters will support it. Go on Gordon and Alistair remind people what a Labour government is for.<br><strong>Cllr Steve Munby</strong><br>Labour, Liverpool </p> <p>I am a pensioner on a fixed income and last winter turned off my central heating because of the soaring cost of gas. Although I was able to keep fairly warm by exercise and by going to bed early, not everyone can do this, especially older people with mobility problems. To avoid pensioner deaths from hypothermia, it is essential that fuel costs are reduced. Short of renationalising the gas and electricity industries - the best solution in my view - a windfall tax would be a socially fair way of helping all those on low incomes to heat their homes.<br><strong>Jay Ginn</strong><br>Coulsdon, Surrey </p> <p>The ill-conceived dogma of privatisation has come home to roost. While the privatisation of non-essentials was welcome, the same cannot be said of the energy and water companies. We are now in the position that these essential commodities are controlled by foreign interests. Why does the government not build the nuclear power stations, wind and wave farms and set themselves up once again as a national energy supplier, and give real competition to a market that is in dire need of it? There would be loud bleating from the self-interested lobby, but national interest should take precedence. I have no objection to the price of energy being subsidised, since that subsidy can be recouped through taxation ... say 5p on the higher rate of income tax, perhaps.<br><strong>Paul Chesters</strong><br>Wallasey, Wirral </p> <p>The time for a windfall tax on utilities is now. Hard-working people are being hit as almost every news bulletin brings news of fuel increases. The Treasury may cavil and bleat about alleged fears of discouraging investment, but so far as I and millions of lifetime Labour voters are concerned, it's just the same old long-playing record by people who have their snouts in the trough. Labour ministers ought to know that it is not a crime to actually do something which would help people who feel under the cosh and also be popular.<br><strong>Cllr Martin Prestidge</strong><br>Oldbury, West Midlands </p> <p>Your leader (August 27) graphically describes the problems and complexities associated with a windfall tax on energy, both whom to tax and how to distribute the proceeds. In addition the link with climate change is ignored. The Irish government is considering an approach called Cap and Share that avoids complexity. If adopted, emission-coupons would be distributed equally to all adults and the energy companies would have to buy them annually through banks and post offices to cover the emissions for which their fuel would be responsible. The government could then control the level of emissions - gradually reducing them to sustainable levels - and people would automatically be compensated by the energy companies for the rise in prices.<br><strong>James Bruges</strong><br>Bristol </p> <p>I would be much happier with Deborah Hargreaves argument against a windfall tax on international energy companies if I believed for a moment that these huge sums would be invested in the UK for the benefit of UK residents and not distributed to worldwide shareholders.<br><strong>Chris Thompson</strong><br>Oxford</p>",

  "<p>Deaths from the hospital infection Clostridium difficile jumped by 28% last year to more than 8,000, according to official figures published yesterday. </p> <p>The Department of Health claimed the rise was the result of more accurate reporting of deaths by hospitals rather than a continuing spread of infections. </p> <p>The latest quarterly bulletin of the Office for National Statistics said death certificates citing C difficile had risen from 6,480 in 2006 to 8,324 in 2007. The rise was higher among men than among women. Since 2005, the number of reported deaths has nearly doubled, from 3,757. </p> <p>Certificates must record the hospital bug where it is a factor in the death, even if it is not the only cause. In more than half of cases another illness was recorded as the primary reason for death. The C difficile story contrasts with that of MRSA, the original \"superbug\". Cases involving MRSA are on the decline. The ONS data shows that mentions on death certificates dropped from 1,652 in 2006 to 1,593 in 2007, the first time deaths have shown a decrease since the ONS began keeping records in 1993. MRSA was the underlying cause in about one in three of the deaths. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Norman Lamb, called the statistics \"horrifying\" while Andrew Lansley, the Conservative spokesman, claimed the vast majority of the deaths could have been avoided if the government had taken the right action at the right time.</p> <p>Professor Brian Duerden, inspector of microbiology and infection control at the DoH, said steps taken to combat hospital infections included hand-washing guidance, guidance on antibiotic prescribing and clinical care of patients with C difficile.</p>",
  "<p>A self-taught gunsmith who ran an illegal arms factory converting replica sub-machine guns into lethal weapons was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday, with a minimum term of 11 years.</p> <p>At least eight people, including teenager Michael Dosunmu, were killed by weapons converted by Grant Wilkinson in a shed in Berkshire. Dosunmu was shot by mistake as he slept in his bed in Peckham, south London. Another weapon was used during the robbery in which PC Sharon Beshenivsky was murdered three years ago in Bradford.</p> <p>Passing sentence, Judge Zoe Smith told the 34-year-old: \"The scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country. The rollcall of deaths and injuries is horrific. Some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and, regrettably but doubtlessly, the rollcall of death and serious injury will continue to rise.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson, of no fixed address, was convicted on Wednesday at Reading crown court of buying replica MAC-10 submachine guns and converting them into lethal weapons. Police said his operation was one of the largest they had ever discovered. </p> <p>They believe it produced 90 guns which were responsible for a fifth of shootings in London over two years.</p> <p>Detectives have offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information to help find the weapons still on the streets. </p> <p>Wilkinson, who grew up in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in his early teens for stealing a \u00a3100 pair of trainers from Lillywhites in London, and was in trouble with police regularly thereafter.</p> <p>\"Grant was expelled from Beaconsfield secondary school in the fourth year, probably age about 15, for persistent disruptive behaviour,\" a family friend said. \"He never went back to school after that. He worked on building sites as a labourer, but became involved in drug dealing, which was what his first prison term was for, as well as more thieving.\" His convictions date back to 1995.</p> <p>In 1996 he was jailed for four years for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. In 2002, he received another three years in prison for possession of drugs with intent to supply.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replica guns claiming to be involved in the making of a James Bond film. Weapons and bullets linked to nine murder scenes came from his factory. He paid \u00a3500 for the replica MAC-10s, which are made in the UK. After conversion, they were sold for \u00a32,500, including ammunition. It is believed middlemen sold them on to criminal gangs.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas from Sabre Defence Industries, which had supplied previous Bond movie productions. He converted the submachine guns into lethal weapons in two garden sheds behind a derelict property in Three Mile Cross, near Reading. Police were called in July 2007 after tenants in a nearby house accidentally came across the sheds.</p> <p>Officers discovered expensive industrial equipment used to smelt and cut metals. They also found 27,700 spent cartridges at one shed and another site.</p> <p>Wilkinson was convicted of a series of arms offences, including conspiracy to convert an imitation firearm into a firearm, conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms and ammunition, possession of a firearm with intent to enable another person to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm, namely a MAC-10 submachine gun. A second man, Garry Lewis, was cleared of all charges. </p> <p>Denis Burke, of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex case unit, said the racket \"met the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity. The firearms have since been used in all of our big cities, especially London\".</p> <p>Abdullah al-Yunusi, defending, said in mitigation that his client was \"of low intelligence,\" having not only supplied drugs but used them. He said Wilkinson had no direct connection with the end users of the guns, as a complex supply chain had been involved.</p>",
  "<p>Lee Westwood is guaranteed a place in Europe's 2008 Ryder Cup squad but his chances of receiving a good luck note from the greens' committee here took a serious dent last night after he suggested that his kids could make a better job of designing some of the holes on the course hosting this week's Johnnie Walker Championship.</p> <p>The Scottish venue is also due to stage the Ryder Cup in 2014, six years hence and just about enough time to fix up the course, if the Englishman is to be believed. \"You could rip them up and replace them,\" he said when asked what could be done to improve the greens. \"Hopefully, they won't use the designer who had two goes at doing the 7th because if you have two goes to get it to that stage . . . well, my kids could do better in one afternoon.\"</p> <p>Do not expect that one to appear in the next marketing brochure for this exclusive resort. Nor this: \"The people I feel sorry for are those who are trying to get into the Ryder Cup. This is a big week for them. They must be feeling the pressure and it can't help standing over a three-footer not knowing if the putt is going to run straight.\"</p> <p>Alas for fans of Gleneagles, and there were still a few to be found on the range yesterday, his comments could not be dismissed as the words of a man embittered after failing to break 80. The Englishman did three-putt from 18 inches on the 5th but, even so, he still shot a one-under 72.</p> <p>That was good enough for a tie for 14th place, four shots behind the first-round leader Gregory Havret of France, whose 68 left him with a two-shot advantage over Paul Broadhurst, Gary Orr, Robert Rock and Christian Cevaer.</p> <p>It would be a harsh judge indeed who would dismiss any of the above but those following the intrigue surrounding Nick Faldo's two captain's picks for Sunday will have been disappointed at the leaderboard lacking the names of those who have been at the centre of the speculation. No Nick Dougherty (73), no Oliver Wilson (76) and no Martin Kaymer (76).</p> <p>Of those, only Wilson occupies one of the 10 automatic spots. \"Shooting three-over isn't going to do a lot for my chances but I don't think I have played myself out of it either. I could have done but managed to scramble and keep things together,\" he said. \"The greens are not overly smooth, but I felt I was a little bit unlucky - every time I hit it in the rough I got a bad lie.\"</p> <p>Of those who may (or may not) make the team to face the US in Kentucky next month via a captain's pick Darren Clarke had the best day, shooting a one-under 72. That represented a fair effort, especially as he played in the afternoon when the breeze was up and the greens were bumpier than an Irish back road, but the Ulsterman might have expected better at three-under with four holes to play.</p> <p>Another who has found himself in the midst of the Ryder Cup gossip this week has been Colin Montgomerie, although this week the Scotsman glories under the title tournament chairman and, as such, was required to have an opinion on Westwood's opinion. \"I have a couple of important rounds left to play this week so let's just leave the greens as they are,\" he said. Spoken like a true tournament chairman. </p> <p>As for his one-over round of 74, he sounded more optimistic than he really ought to be. \"I'm not out of the tournament by any means,\" he said. He was right about that, although given the widely-held view that Faldo is not inclined to hand him one of the two coveted spots under any circumstances, he might as well be.</p>",
  "<p>Bilal Shafayat is only 24, but there have been times during his career when he seemed ready to be consigned to the overflowing drawer marked \"wasted English talent\". However, a mediocre 2007 following a move from Northamptonshire led to a winter with Pakistan Customs, and the dedication appears to be paying off: the 118 he made here yesterday was his second hundred in four innings. Nottinghamshire's title chase has received impetus at just the right moment.</p> <p>Once a teenage prodigy and captain of England Under-19s, Shafayat revived fond memories during an opening stand of 157 with Will Jefferson, who made 80, his best in the championship for three years, before falling to a leg-side edge off Ollie Rayner. Shafayat treated the 19-year-old leg-spinner Will Beer harshly during his first spell in the championship and slog-swept Rayner contemptuously for four.</p> <p>When Beer was deposited for six to bring up Shafayat's century, this devout Muslim dropped to his knees and kissed the turf. It was not the only emotion on show. The retiring Mushtaq Ahmed was given a hero's send-off during a tea break extended by 10 minutes, and at one stage both he and the Sussex captain Chris Adams, conveying his gratitude via a microphone, were fighting back the tears. It was a day when no one minded county cricket displaying its softer side.</p> <p>Earlier, Sussex's hopes of taking control were undermined by Nottinghamshire's England Lions seamer Charlie Shreck, who took four for eight in 27 deliveries to help turn a promising 318 for five into 339 all out. Carl Hopkinson was bowled for 62, Robin Martin-Jenkins caught at short extra for 35, and Beer and James Kirtley both removed for ducks.</p> <p>After that, the Sussex bowlers lined up for the slaughter and Jefferson smashed Rayner for sixes in successive overs: the second caught a female spectator flush on the side of the head. She recovered quickly, but Sussex's hopes of defending their title may not.</p>",
  "<p>An increasingly violent insurgency in Somalia is fuelling a fresh refugee crisis with nearly 40,000 people arriving at a desert camp in north-eastern Kenya this year despite the border being closed. </p> <p>The Dadaab settlement now hosts more than 210,000 people, making it the world's biggest refugee camp. With at least 200 new arrivals every day, aid workers are struggling to cope. </p> <p>\"We are already at bursting point,\" said Maeve Murphy, field officer with the UN Refugee Agency in Dadaab, 60 miles south of the border with Somalia. \"And more refugees are on their way.\"</p> <p>The refugees are fleeing the worst fighting in Somalia since the early 90s, when the country's descent into anarchy began. On one side is the internationally recognised but weak Transitional Federal Government (TFG), supported by thousands of Ethiopian troops. Waging an increasingly effective guerrilla war against them is a broad-based, Islamist-led opposition, whose hardline wing last week took over the strategic port city of Kismayo. </p> <p>More than 8,000 civilians have been killed in Somalia since the beginning of last year, while nearly one million people have been internally displaced since September 2007. Drought, hyperinflation and year-on-year food prices increases of up to 700% have compounded the humanitarian crisis. </p> <p>The UN's Food Security Analysis Unit on Wednesday described the situation as \"alarming and profound\". Some 3.2 million people - nearly half the population - needed emergency assistance, it said, up from 1.8 million people in January. One in six children under the age of five is acutely malnourished. </p> <p>But aid delivery is more difficult than anywhere in the world, with the possible exception of Afghanistan, humanitarian workers say. Pirates prevent food relief arriving by sea, while ambushes, roadblocks and targeted assassinations have had a severe impact on field operations. All of south and central Somalia and large parts of the northern Puntland region are almost completely off-limits to international staff.</p> <p>The capital, Mogadishu, remains the centre of the insurgency and it is there that many of Dadaab's new arrivals start their journeys. Paying \u00a350 for a seat in a truck or minibus, they make the 600-mile journey south to the Kenyan border, which has been officially closed since early 2007 but remains porous enough for the refugees to sneak through. </p> <p>Abdullahi Shimoy Mukhtar, 40, who arrived in Dadaab with his family on August 1, said that the insecurity had made it impossible to earn a living in Mogadishu. </p> <p>\"If the government soldiers or Ethiopians suspect that you support al-Shabaab [fighters from the Islamist wing], they will kill you in the street, and vice-versa.\"</p> <p>Dadaab, where temperatures often touch 40C (104F), consists of three neighbouring camps, though a fourth may soon have to be built. The newcomers' shelters are desert igloos; bent branches covered with plastic sheeting and blankets. But Mukhtar's brother Muhammad said: \"Even if we have nothing else here, we have security. There is a dark future for Somalia.\" </p> <p>Few Somalia watchers would disagree, at least for the short term. The TFG's president, the former warlord Abdullahi Yusuf, whom most observers now regard as serious obstacle to progress, is locked in a power-struggle with his prime minister, Nur Hassan Hussein. The political arm of Islamist opposition, known as the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS), is also deeply divided.</p> <p>Desperate for some sort of peace deal, the UN and western diplomats have been pushing the \"Djibouti Agreement\", which creates deadlines for a ceasefire, the deployment of international peacekeepers and the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops. On August 18, the TFG finally signed the deal with the moderate ARS faction headed by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed. </p> <p>But though some Islamist military commanders strongly support the agreement, the more militant arm of the ARS, headed by the Eritrea-based cleric Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, remains opposed to it. Aweys, who has his own field commanders, also has close ties to al-Shabaab, and to Hassan al-Turki, another veteran Somali radical with his own militias. </p> <p>All three are on the terrorist list drawn up by the US, which strongly backed Ethiopia's invasion in late 2006. Some European countries believe the alleged links to al-Qaida are exaggerated and unhelpful to the peace process.</p> <p>Various Islamist militias from the hardline ARS faction helped win the two-day battle for Kismayo from last week, assisted by local clan militias opposed to Barre Hirale, a warlord and MP who controlled the town. </p> <p>One western diplomat described the victory as \"photocopy\" of what had occurred in September 2006, when Islamist forces captured Kismayo from Hirale before Ethiopia's intervention.</p> <p>If they keep hold of the port, the Islamists will net millions of dollars in annual revenues, can easily ship in weapons, and will effectively control the coastline all the way south to Kenya. </p> <p>\"Ethiopia and the US have to think quickly about how they want to respond,\" said a Somalia analyst in Nairobi. \"It's a pretty bold move by the Islamists.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Somalia's current crisis dates back to early 2006. Backed by the local population, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) defeated a group of warlords that had controlled Mogadishu for more than a decade. A mix of moderates and more extreme clerics, the ICU was viewed by Ethiopia and the US as a potential terrorist threat. When the Islamists expanded their reach, challenging the unpopular Transitional Federal Government, Ethiopian troops poured across the border. Virtually unchallenged, they occupied Mogadishu in December 2006. Most Somalis resented the Ethiopian occupation, and the remnants of the ICU began an insurgency. Ethiopia has since become bogged down in its own \"mini-Iraq\", unable to defeat the insurgents or to withdraw without also ensuring the swift demise of the Somali government.</p>",
  "<p>Something shattered when the Georgian artillery opened up with a massive barrage on Tskhinvali on August 7 (Colonel Arsen Tsukhishvili, chief of staff of the Artillery Brigade said with pride that 300 of his gun barrels fired at the enemy simultaneously). What broke was not only the columns of Russian tanks the Georgian artillery was aiming at. It was a 16-year post-Soviet consensus about the power of Russia to affect the course taken by its neighbours. The cold, unspoken western calculation was that, the quicker we pushed eastwards with a combination of political, oil and military projects, the less Russia could resist. Even an economically resurgent Russia was still judged to be either too weak, too poor or just too ramshackle to stop it.</p> <p>To claim, as David Miliband did yesterday, that Nato did not have a sphere of influence and that the eastern expansion of the military alliance was merely an expression of individual democracies exercising their new-found sovereignty, was breathtakingly disingenuous. In May, a subcommittee of the Nato Parliamentary Assembly, a body that brings together parliamentarians from Nato members and its partners visited Romania and Bulgaria, two of the six states along the Black Sea and the latest members of Nato. The topics discussed on this visit strayed far from its brief - energy and environmental security. The committee heard how Romania and Bulgaria occupy a strategic position between Europe, the largest energy consumer, and the oil-producing countries. Two rival oil and gas pipelines, the EU-backed Nabucco pipeline and the South Stream project backed by Russia, arrive here. Talk of oil and gas led seamlessly on to the military role Nato could play in securing this supply. Paragraph 28 of the executive summary of this visit reads: \"Nato has not traditionally played a role in energy security matters ... It can however play a more active role defending energy infrastructure and the flow of oil and gas on the high seas ... Nato might also provide security for infrastructure in energy-producing states facing unrest.\"</p> <p>Nato yesterday brushed aside Russian claims that an naval exercise in the western part of the Black Sea had anything to do with the crisis going on in the eastern shore. The Nato parliamentarian's visit held before the Georgian crisis erupted says otherwise. If this is not a \"sphere of influence\" being constructed and planned by Nato's existing members along Russia's most sensitive border in the South Caucasus and right though Russia's most sensitive sea, what is? </p> <p>The cold war was a nuclear standoff between two military superpowers with mutually opposed economic systems and ideological beliefs. The new period we could be entering lacks many cold war ingredients. Russia is weaker militarily than the Soviet Union was and its reach is not global. It can sell arms to Syria or Iran, but it can no longer restart the revolution in Angola or Cuba. Russia is unashamedly capitalist. But it is also now<strong> </strong>allergically<strong> </strong>anti-western and free to form its own alliances. That was evident in the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev flying eastwards to Tajikistan on Wednesday for a summit with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, an assembly which includes Russia, China and four former members of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The way to counter the forces unleashed on August 7 is clear: stop rearranging the furniture on Russia's sensitive southern border; stop militarising the Black Sea; stop pretending that this is only a conflict about loftier goals, a simple struggle between authoritarianism and western liberal democracy. The ethnically driven post-Soviet map is more complex than that. Local conflicts should be kept local. As things stand, everything is being done to widen them out to the regional level. As a result, Russia and Nato are sleepwalking into a confrontation that neither needs, and neither has planned for.</p>",
  "<p>Theatre can produce many reactions: grief, enjoyment, amusement, boredom, back pain. But last week, for the first time in 30 years of ticket stubs, I came out of a playhouse feeling rage and guilt, and wanting to march to Downing Street to demand an answer.</p> <p>The play, a production by the Sherman Cymru company touring to the Traverse in Edinburgh, was Deep Cut, an investigation into the deaths from gunshot wounds of four British army privates at Deepcut barracks in Surrey between 1995 and 2002. If you yawningly think you know this story and are tempted to turn the page, the point of this piece is that I am no longer sure that we do know, and turning pages may have kept killers from justice.</p> <p>Philip Ralph's script was inspired by the campaign of doubt run by the parents of Private Cheryl James, whose body was found beside her gun. Her death - like those in similar circumstances of Ptes Benton, Gray and Collinson - was attributed to suicide.</p> <p>The play rigorously and shockingly makes the case that all were cases of murder or, at the least, manslaughter. Verbatim evidence from a ballistics expert, Frank Swann, about the positioning of wounds and blood shows it is extremely unlikely that any of the soldiers could have fired on themselves. It is also alleged that initial police investigations were inadequate, and evidence of a culture of sex, drinking and bullying among recruits was given insufficient weight by Nicholas Blake QC, who chaired an internal inquiry.</p> <p>There is a small group of dramas and documentaries that changed British society: Cathy Come Home radicalised attitudes to the homeless; Who Bombed Birmingham? helped to free innocent men from jail; and Police reshaped treatment of rape victims. If its allegations are accurate, Deep Cut is an equally important piece, and demands a response from the authorities.</p> <p>I mentioned feeling guilt as well as anger, and I mean the remorse at having failed to engage with a story that, in its theatrical presentation, seems a large-scale scandal. The only exoneration is that what is being claimed seems so improbable. Either a serial killer was on the loose for seven years in the army, or the base was so out of control that a succession of situations - fuelled by lust, drunkenness or bullying - ended with soldiers shooting colleagues. If the play has a weakness, it's that in only one case is a plausible motive (sexual betrayal) advanced for murder.</p> <p>Even so, it would be impossible for a fair-minded person to leave the theatre believing that these four young people took their own lives. The question that arises - and the source of my self-reproach - is why a story that seemed so ambiguous and easy to dismiss when presented as journalism should seem so clear cut on stage.</p> <p>Part of the answer is that we are captive and focused in the auditorium, free from the temptation to flick channels or pages. But the play also offers two other explanations for the story's failure to spark the radar of public alarm. The first is that Blake's investigation, though in some ways deliberately restricted by the terms of inquiry, was also inadvertently limited. Swann refused to appear because he believed that the tribunal was predisposed to find for suicide - although his absence made such a finding more likely. Internal investigations into army and police conduct were also omitted from the Blake papers.</p> <p>However, the journalist Brian Cathcart - a source for, and a character in, the play - has argued that this story was a failure of journalism. He suggests that a tactic employed by the Ministry of Defence (releasing a huge report too close to deadlines to allow informed coverage when interest was at its height) successfully hobbled reporters.</p> <p>Because of this - and Swann's refusal to give evidence to Blake - no newspaper or news bulletin has ever carried the powerful distillation of the major points that Ralph makes available in the play. But if Cathcart is right, then this failure of journalism has now been exacerbated because a small-scale theatre production may just have done a Woodward and Bernstein.</p> <p>Clearly, it's important to accept that Ralph's script is only the case for the prosecution; and that, in any proceedings, other forensic experts might, for example, disagree with Swann. (There are suggestions in the play that he is a passionate maverick who might be rich pickings for a scowling counsel.) </p> <p>But, with regard to the material presented on stage, there are only two possibilities: either Deep Cut is a clever but mendacious exercise in selection of evidence and special pleading; or it has exposed a grave failure of policing and state regulation, involving a cover-up of four murders.</p> <p>As to what should happen next, there exists no legal mechanism for compelling someone to attend a theatrical performance, but it seems to me that Nicholas Blake has a moral duty to watch the play and then issue either a writ for defamation or a statement on whether he has changed his mind. The secretary of state for defence should be cajoled into the audience, and then explain why he sees no case for an independent public inquiry.</p> <p>Deep Cut has already had enthusiastic notices, which are deeply merited. But what this production most deserves is a judicial review.</p> <p><a href=\"comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Being 80 is the moment of truth.

My 95- year-old aunt says, \"Oh, the 80s were fine.\" I recently came across a card she wrote when she was 89 which said: \"I've bought a new car, I've had a blood transfusion and I've booked our next summer holiday.

It's always a question at a school or a college reunion whether it's more depressing to see Helen Mirren lookalikes, who make you feel you should be trying a whole lot harder, or crumbling old people your age who make you think, \"Oh God, that's how old I really am.\" You are unlikely to charm anyone at a party with the melting invitation of your smile, and you're preoccupied with wondering about a hearing aid, considering a cataract operation, being begged by your children to hold on to the banister going down stairs.</p> <p>Ah, the children. Or rather the young, since so many of our age either haven't got children, or they live hundreds of miles away, or don't get on with them anyway. What has fundamentally changed, between my generation and that of our parents, is that the dependence of one generation on another - either way round - is negotiable, not laid down. The old used to advise the young, but technology has reversed the equation, and it's the young who teach the old how to cope with the newfangled mechanisms of modern life. (I couldn't be writing this if my son hadn't kindly endured a wholly tiresome two hours sorting out my errant laptop.)</p> <p>There's no denying that the over-80s are terribly concerned about health. When you're younger you mostly think that if something's wrong with you, they fix it and you're back to normal. Not at our age. We have a hip problem; OK, they give us a new one, which may have us dancing around like Fred Astaire (though probably not like Ginger Rogers, who did everything he did only backwards and in high heels), but it may mean a stick from then on. We don't necessarily expect our small ailments to go away - just to be treatable. Pills are our daily diet. The health service, having switched, in the words of the great Sir George Godber (the brilliant chief medical officer in the 1960s), from emphasising care to concentrating on treatment, is probably going to be quite good at treating the burgeoning over-80s. But we'll have a hard time finding anywhere to recover, when there are no convalescent homes and we're regarded as bed-blockers in hospitals. I've had women write to my Saga magazine agony column saying they've got plenty of women friends, but would so like to meet a man because they're sick of talking about health all the time. (I tell them to stop hoping to bump into a literate widower and join the University of the Third Age, a self-help organisation providing courses and companionship, which simply didn't exist in the olden days.)</p> <p>I don't need to labour the fact that there is going to be a crisis when the diminishing number of young are asked to prop up the pensions of the vast expanding army of the old; it seems perfectly obvious that the old are going to have to work longer, and I would be astounded if anyone under 60 thought anyone older should be able to just sit back and put their feet up at their expense.</p> <p>So the question of work is crucial. The days when you were at work by your early 20s at latest, rose to some sort of seniority or expertise by 45, and retired at 60 or so are obviously over. It probably isn't reasonable any more to think of each of us having just one career or skill - especially if we went into it in the first place mainly through lack of an available alternative. We badly need many more chances and grants for older people to retrain, reassess, rethink or switch skills. I had a great aunt who wanted to go to university; her father didn't approve so she waited till he died and then went at 40. Later she wished to study art in Paris, but had to wait until she was 60 and her disapproving mother had died. That wouldn't work today, because both Mama and Papa would live too long; and maybe by then she would be a bit old for student life in Paris. But maybe not: art is one of the things enjoyed by thousands of pensioners, and there must be more indifferent water colours around Europe today than when sketching was the only thing a polite young lady should do.</p> <p>What do we - the old - want or need? A reason to get up in the morning - collecting dolls, washing the dog, deadheading the roses, protesting against ... what? Oh, come on, there's always something to protest about - a Guardian reader shouldn't need to ask. We need something we can use for money, and we need people. Family maybe; neighbours perhaps; members of the book group or the cricket club (you can always do the scoring); other people who are also barmy about cats - and maybe someone to love. You can't count on that, of course - but can anyone? What we want and need is not, when you come to think of it, much different from what anyone wants - it may just be harder to find. But a recent survey suggested that the old are actually happier than the middle-aged; so there could be a good time coming.</p> <h2>Syd Lissner, 80, lives in north London</h2> <p>When I was a lad, the main difference was that we were much more family-orientated. Even though I grew up through the war, and was evacuated and separated from my brother and sister, society still had this thing called unity, which you don't have today. Now people only see the grey hair when they look at an older person, not the person inside. I think younger people expect us oldies not to know about sex and drugs, and that doesn't bother me - but when I was younger, I was a musician and I smoked a few joints. </p> <p>Older people are written off and neglected, but I don't really feel any different. I get up at 5.30am every day and do a workout in the garden, then some meditation. I go swimming and do Pilates and the housework. I feel fit, so I have nothing to complain about. I go to the Turkish baths once a week - they call me the Senile Hooligan as a joke. I think doing exercise every day gives you more confidence and you get to meet other active people. They say, \"Oh, you old git, still doing it?\" and that's encouraging. I think if other older people got that sort of encouragement they would be happier exercising too. </p> <p>I joined the merchant navy when I was 15 and I worked all my life. You name it, I've done it. I worked until I was 79 at Hatton Garden [London's jewellery quarter]. At first, it's a great psychological change to give up work, and unless you take a positive attitude you begin to wonder what you're living for, but I don't really mind being retired. I go to the library and try to keep mentally healthy. I used to read one book a year, but now I read two a week and the papers from front to back. I've been with my wife since the 1960s and I'm lucky - you do need companionship.</p> <p>I haven't really noticed that there are more people in their 80s now, but it does worry me if people think we're going to be a burden on the state. Lots of pensioners are struggling and have to choose between eating or putting the heating on. When I turned 80, the government gave me an extra 25p a week on my pension - that's going to make me the last of the big spenders, isn't it?</p> <p>By this age, I think you're more understanding and tolerant. You have a fixed income with your pension so you live your life around that. I could go on for another 10 years, or another day, so it's not really worth worrying about anything, is it?</p> <h2>Andy Servin, 83, lives in east London</h2> <p>Younger people can be patronising to old people - they think we haven't lived, even though over the last 80 years we've probably seen a lot more than they ever have or will. I don't think people give older people the same respect that they used to. When I first came to this country people would say good morning to older people in the street. </p> <p>I arrived from St Lucia in 1959, and while I know a lot of people experience racism, people were very nice to me. I had been a policeman in St Lucia, but when I came to Britain I worked for London Underground, then the Post Office. Everyone was interested in where I had come from and asked how I was dealing with the cold. Now older people are sometimes frightened to walk down the street, and that makes me sad. </p> <p>I have noticed there are more older people around now. We are living longer, aren't we? These days, it's my health that causes me problems, not my age - I have a hernia but my doctor isn't sure if my heart would survive an operation. I can't complain, though. I'm still around. I'm growing old, but not gracefully, I'm sorry to say. I go to the Hibiscus community centre twice a week, because it's important to get out and see friends, be sociable - it keeps your mind young. I come here, play dominoes, have a chat, make some noise. If you've got a group of West Indies men together, you will get a lot of noise.</p> <p>I'm lucky that I'm still with my wife - her health isn't good either, but at least we're sinking together. I saw a few of my Post Office friends recently and we were talking about the old days and how not many of us are still around now. As I say, I'm lucky. I've been alive a long time. I've had a good life and I've enjoyed every minute of it. </p> <h2>Helen Granville, 86, lives near Beverley in Yorkshire</h2> <p>I've been on my own for 25 years, since my husband died, and I've got used to it. I worked in our fish-and-chip shop for 30 years and when I retired, started volunteering at the Cancer Research shop, where I've been for 21 years. I used to work there four or five times a week, but I broke my wrist recently so I haven't been able to drive and had to cut down my hours. Apart from the fact that I enjoy it and like the people, it gets me out of the house. I don't know why old people stay at home all day and mope.</p> <p>I would like to have been a teacher but my father died down the mine when I was nine and I had to leave school and make money for the family. Until recently, I taught English to immigrants, though, which I enjoyed. </p> <p>I wouldn't like to be starting out in life again in today's climate - a lady came into the shop the other day in a state because someone had stolen her purse. When I look back on my life, I do wonder what I've done with it but I'm happy - I have three children and grandchildren, and now great-grandchildren. Apart from my two new hips and a broken wrist, I'm not in too bad shape really. Since my husband died, I've taken on a lot of responsibilities - just things that he dealt with around the house and with the car, so I'm learning new things even at an older age. I took up writing when I was 82. I write little ditties. But I wouldn't call them poetry exactly. </p> <h2>Dr Irving Gilbert, 92, lives in a care home in south London</h2> <p>I can't believe I'm 92 - I put it down to luck and a good set of chromosomes. I smoked for a while when I was a student, but I haven't for years now. I moved to my nursing home, Nightingale, last year. It was sad to leave my house - I had lived in it for 50 years - and especially my garden. When you reach 92, you find that you've lost most of your friends and you're suddenly all alone. You go through an initial period of shock while you establish a new life, but I do like it here. There are always people milling about and there's no need to be lonely. They do activities and outings and I joined a computer class and have learned to use the internet and email. I'm very proud of that. </p> <p>These days I am physically restricted - I have to use a wheelchair if I'm going somewhere. I'm also very forgetful, but I think I'm probably allowed to be. I never think about the future. I just live every day and enjoy it. You have more perspective as you get older. You realise that the most important thing is your health, whereas before people might have thought it was money. </p> <p>I was a consultant physician, an endoscopist, and I was there when the NHS started in 1948.It was very exciting - morale was high. When you were 65, you were automatically retired. I carried on as a locum until I was 71 and, by then, the NHS was in a sorry state. If I see a doctor who is smiling, I know he's retired. </p> <p>I was married for 64 years, and I don't know what the secret is - probably being tolerant of each other. It's very important to have company. I was lucky enough to meet someone recently who I could talk to. A woman? Of course!</p> <h2>Peggy Webb, 84, lives near Peterborough</h2> <p>On a good day I feel 22, which was my happiest time as I had just got married - but on a bad day I feel 99. The worst thing about being older is the aches and pains, and the frustration that you can't do as much as you would like. But I am lucky to be living with my daughter and son-in-law, as I never get lonely. I'm deaf and my dog, Suki, is always by my side and works as my ears, which means I can be as independent as I want to be.</p> <p>Everybody changes along with their circumstances - some mellow like a fine wine and some become more cantankerous. I have always been treated well by almost everybody - people will always offer me a seat, open a door and treat me nicely and with respect. Would I like to start my life again now? No, thanks. I'm pleased to have lived through the years that I have done and I was lucky to have a large close-knit family. It was also nice to be part of a community with a much slower pace of life.</p> <p>\u2022 Interviews by Emine Saner</p>",
  "<p>Lisa Batiashvili is such a vital and magnetic live performer, a violinist with enormous promise and the inquiring mind with which to fulfil it, that it's a surprise and a disappointment to find her account of the Beethoven concerto so unremarkable. Not that violin playing of such control and purpose can ever be entirely run of the mill; just that something more distinctive and fresh was expected. There are few personal moments in her playing, though the central slow movement contains more poetry than the outer ones, and the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie, which she also directs here, accompanies sensitively. The fillip is six arrangements for violin and orchestra by Batiashvili's father (also a violinist) of pieces from Sulkhan Tsintsadze's set of miniatures originally composed for string quartet. They are a pleasant mix of folksy dances and yearning melodies, a bit like Bart\u00f3k's folksong arrangements, and Batiashvili plays them with dash and affection. Whether they sit entirely comfortably alongside the Beethoven concerto is a different matter.</p>",
  "<p>Back in June, US singer-songwriter Aimee Mann launched a competition for fans to cover Freeway, one of the tracks from her lovelorn new album, @\u00a3%&amp;*! Smilers. Some 160 entries were uploaded to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/group/aimeemanncontest\">youtube.com/group/aimeemanncontest</a>, amassing several hundred thousand views between them. Last week, Mann revealed the winner of the contest via an extremely poor quality video of a webcam chat with one of her people (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/aimeemann\">youtube.com/aimeemann</a>). However, the biggest disappointment wasn't that Mann couldn't match her fans' effort in making videos, but that she picked John Galt's pleasant-but-safe acoustic version as <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/aimee1\">the winner</a>. Both iSO's robot-man <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/aimee2\">vocoder effort</a> and Greg Friedman's <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/aimee3\">jaunty reinterpretation</a> were far superior; arguably outdoing Mann's own version. If you think you can do even better, the lyrics and an instrumental MP3 are still available from her <a href=\"http://www.tinryurl.com/aimee4\">website</a>.</p> <p>Until Monday, there are 30 hours of on-demand footage available from last weekend's Reading Festival on the BBC's site (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/readingandleeds\">bbc.co.uk/readingandleeds</a>). So, you can check out extended highlights of headline sets from the Killers, Queens of the Stone Age, Metallica, Manic Street Preachers, Babyshambles and the Last Shadow Puppets. The one big exception is Rage Against the Machine, although you can watch their guitarist Tom Morello teaming up in the Beeb's Reading studio with System of a Down frontman Serj Tankian for a curiously dreadful acoustic number, which sounds like a Flight of the Conchords song without the punchline. Swerve that to watch sets from rising names such as Santogold, Cajun Dance Party, Emmy the Great and Cage the Elephant instead. The BBC's Notting Hill carnival coverage wasn't nearly as comprehensive, but you can still hear plenty of 1Xtra's shows from the event on the iPlayer, with Norman Jay's <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/normancarnival\">two-hour mix</a> of carnival classics a particular treat.</p> <p>Pepsico entered the netlabel business last week, launching <a href=\"http://www.GreenLabelSound.com\">GreenLabelSound.com</a> to give away music on behalf of its Mountain Dew brand. The first MP3 is by much-tipped Chicago rap duo the Cool Kids, which, one imagines, is also the demographic they're hoping to shift more fizzy pop to. Although the track doesn't namecheck the brand, the influential <a href=\"http://www.tinyurl.com/wiredcoolkids\">Wired.com blog</a> admitted it was \"suspicious\" of art and commerce merging in such a way. Certainly, the rappers' quotes in Wired's piece did seem excessively naive: \"Mountain Dew is not trying to push their product through music like everyone else,\" insisted Chuck Inglish, \"they just wanna support music.\" Still, as the drink isn't actually available in this country and you can get the impressive track without giving any personal details, UK users can download it without fear of succumbing to any subliminal marketing.</p>",
  "<p>One of Turkey's most senior army commanders has warned the Islamist-rooted government that it will face a powerful military backlash if it seeks to alter the country's secular system.</p> <p>General Isik Kosaner also vowed to defeat domestic critics who, he said, falsely linked the army to an alleged anti-government coup attempt known as Ergenekon, and complained that the fight against violent Kurdish \"terrorists\" was being hampered by new human rights legislation aimed at enhancing Turkey's EU membership bid, which the government strongly backs.</p> <p>The comments were delivered in a setting calculated to have maximum political impact, a military ceremony attended by the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and President Abdullah Gul, who both last month escaped a political ban when the constitutional court narrowly decided against closing the governing Justice and Development party (AKP) for allegedly plotting an Islamic state.</p> <p>Kosaner said the army was determined to defend the unitary secular state founded by Ataturk and brushed off accusations of political meddling.</p> <p>\"Protection of fundamental characteristics of the republic cannot be considered an intervention in domestic politics,\" he said.</p> <p>The remarks were an apparent signal that the AKP remains on probation after the court ruling, in which judges fined the party for being a \"focal point of anti-secularism\" but stopped one vote short of closing it. They were also a rebuff to the EU, which criticised the case as judicial interference and which also supports greater rights for the Kurds.</p> <p>The army has played a pivotal role in Turkish politics since the modern republic was founded in 1923 and has ousted four governments in the past 50 years. It tried unsuccessfully to block Gul's election as president last year because of concerns over his Islamist past and is widely assumed to have backed the closure case brought by the chief prosecutor.</p> <p>Kosaner gave the latest demonstration of its clout while handing over command of the gendarmerie to become the new head of the land forces, making him effectively second in command of the army.</p> <p>He said the army's status as Turkey's most revered institution was under attack from \"certain circles\" - code for AKP supporters - who blamed it for Ergenekon, an alleged coup plot in which more than 80 hardline secularists, including former army officers, have been indicted. \"Imaginary scenarios aim to bring down the reputation of the Turkish armed forces,\" Kosaner said, in the first public remarks on the saga by a senior commander. \"All attacks on our ability to perform our duties are bound to disappear in the face of our resolve.\"</p> <p>He also said EU-inspired laws were helping the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - regarded as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US and the EU.</p> <p>\"Laws that are amended as if there is no terrorism threat against our country prevent the security forces from fighting terrorism in a rapid and effective manner,\" he said. \"If terrorists are threatening human rights, we need to reconsider the balance between rights and freedoms and take counter-measures.\"</p> <p>Gareth Jenkins, an Istanbul-based commentator on Turkish security issues, said Kosaner's comments were partly aimed at reassuring his own officers.</p> <p>\"But there's also speculation about what AKP will do - will it become more moderate or try again (to impose Islamism),\" he said. \"The military are giving them the message that they are still here and prepared to defend secularism.</p> <p>\"There is real frustration within the military at what they see as an assault by the AKP on Ataturk's secular legacy and also what they consider to be the political motivations of the Ergenekon investigation. They think the aim isn't to unearth the 'deep state' but to undermine the military as an institution.\"</p>",
  "<p>Police in Israel are searching for a missing girl who detectives fear was killed by her grandfather and whose disappearance has gripped the nation.</p> <p>Divers were yesterday working through the Yarkon river, north of Tel Aviv, looking for the body of Rose Pizem, four, who police think was killed, bundled into a suitcase and then dropped in the water as long as three months ago.</p> <p>The girl's mother, Marie-Charlotte Renault, 23, and the child's paternal grandfather, Ronny Ron, 45, who were in a relationship, are both being held on remand suspected of involvement in the murder.</p> <p>Although Rose disappeared in May, police only heard of her disappearance two weeks ago when they were alerted by welfare workers that the girl was missing from her home in Netanya.</p> <p>Rose was born in Paris in 2004, when her newly married parents, Renault and Benjamin Pizem, were still teenagers. After a year the couple travelled to Israel to meet Pizem's father, Ron, whom Pizem had never met before.</p> <p>But after some months Renault announced she had fallen in love with Ron and was staying in Israel to be with him. Pizem returned to France with his daughter, Rose.</p> <p>Renault and her father-in-law lived together as a couple and had two more children, and a year ago began a custody case to get Rose from France to live with them in Israel. In December, they won custody and Rose went to live with them. But reports said she was suffering from severe speech and behavioural problems and that the couple struggled to manage the child.</p> <p>Police said Ron had given several accounts of what happened to the girl, which included suggestions she had been sold to Palestinians or sent to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish boarding school. He also told police that he had accidentally struck the child in a moment of anger and that when he realised the child was dead he put her in a suitcase and dropped it in the river. Renault is suspected of either helping to plan or to cover up the killing.</p> <p>\"There is no doubt that as a society, Israel was not there for the child when she was in need of help,\" said Avi Dichter, Israel's internal security minister, who was at the site of the search yesterday. \"Police will do what ever it takes to bring this story to a close.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anbar province, once one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq, is to be handed back to Iraqi control next week. The province, west of Baghdad, is largely populated by Sunni Arabs and used to be the centre of the nationalist insurgency against the US occupation, and later, against foreign-led al-Qaida militants.</p> <p>In the past two years, local tribal leaders have come together in al-Sahwa (the Awakening) movement to confront al-Qaida. US commanders gradually embraced al-Sahwa, providing it with money and arms. This, coupled with the injection of extra Iraqi troops and police, forced al-Qaida to retreat or to slip away to other provinces. Some nationalist rebels joined al-Sahwa while others went to ground.</p> <p>Major General Tareq al-Dulaimi, the provincial police commander, said Iraqi forces would assume control of the vast region on Monday. Lieutenant Colonel Chris Hughes, a marine corps spokesman in Anbar, said the number of US troops there had dropped from 37,000 in February to 25,000, and the Iraqi police force had grown to 28,000, from 5,000 three years ago. Iraqi forces in Anbar will still rely on the US for aerial surveillance and logistics, as well as artillery strikes on request.</p> <p>Anbar was once off-limits to all but local people, with long-distance traffic rare on roads from Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. But the father of a Shia family who drove back to Baghdad from Syria this week through Anbar said: \"It is safe. I had no fear about bringing my wife and children.\"</p> <p>The handover had been due in June, but was postponed at the last moment.

  "<p>The police will be able to question children without their parents or other relatives being present under a shakeup proposed by the Home Office yesterday.</p> <p>Ministers also announced their intention to push ahead with plans for \"shopping centre jails\" - short-term holding centres in busy shopping malls and town centres - to detain low-level offenders for up to four hours so they can be fingerprinted and processed without being taken to a police station.</p> <p>The government's response to the review of police powers under Pace, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, published yesterday also confirmed the expected overhaul in the rules on stop and search, post-charge questioning and bail.</p> <p>Ministers also want to change the rules on identity parades so that a court can draw an \"adverse inference\" from someone's refusal to take part and give officers extra powers to enter the premises of a suspect.</p> <p>But a proposal for an extension of the national DNA database by allowing samples to be taken from people arrested for minor offences such as littering, which featured in an earlier consultation paper, has been \"parked\" pending the outcome of an important human rights case in the autumn.</p> <p>The proposals would have to be given parliamentary approval through secondary legislation before coming into force. No timetable has been set for their implementation.</p> <p>The changes to the rules on interviews of child suspects would mean that the police would no longer have to wait for a parent, guardian or other relative to turn up at the police station. In future the presence of an \"appropriate adult\", a role often fulfilled by a trained lay visitor at the police station, would be sufficient.</p> <p>The Home Office said parents would continue to be invited to attend.</p> <p>\"Supermarket jails\" have been piloted in Oxford Street in London, with a holding room at Selfridges store being used to process shoplifters and other low-level offenders. The aim is to enable the police officer to get back on the beat as soon as possible.</p> <p>Changes are also proposed in the rules surrounding extensions of detention in custody from 24 to 36 hours. Currently, they have to be approved by an officer of the rank of superintendent or above. In future the signature of a police inspector would be sufficient and reviews could be carried out by telephone or video link.</p> <p>The changes on stop and search confirm previous announcements about replacing time-consuming forms with handheld computer technology that will issue a receipt to the person stopped.</p> <p>Tony McNulty, minister for the police, said that changes to Pace codes were designed to reduce police bureaucracy while ensuring they had the powers needed to carry out frontline duties.</p>",
  "<p>Do excuse the absence, storm-chasers: Lost in Showbiz was away developing its debut fragrance line. Apocalypse and Apocalypse Pour Homme will target the Christmas market - but for those who can't wait that long to smell the end, there is important news from New York.</p> <p>Put briefly, a new educational establishment has recently opened its doors. Its name? The New York Reality TV School.</p> <p>Have you ever decided unscripted programming is the career path for you, but felt frustrated that all the great spots were going to other pathologically unself-aware social inadequates? Have you always known that fame is a basic human right, but felt you lacked the appropriate qualifications to \"be yourself\" on camera, while a combination of conflict-generating tasks/hopelessly unqualified judges/weigh-ins/boot camps/polygraphs/makeover glitches/gimlet-eyed bachelorettes/grooming experts/secret millionaires/potential employers/kangaroo testicles attempted to derail your progress toward the most Pyrrhic of victories? Are you able to scream: \"I've got nothing to be ashamed of! I will not be judged by anyone!\" the morning after wetting yourself on national television in a drunken, borderline-physical row, during which you made several anti-Semitic slurs while dressed as a circus clown? Do you think any of this utter, utter crap constitutes having \"gone on an amazing journey\"?</p> <p>Then the New York Reality TV School is the higher education facility for you. </p> <p>After a week in which we've seen the first case of an X-Factor victimhood backstory being debunked, there has never been a more important time to capitalise on the dysfunctional behavioural traits and abuse survival stories that set you apart. </p> <p>\"The mission of the New York Reality TV School is to train and develop non-actors,\" explains its prospectus. \"We train students to be exciting, confident members of reality TV casts . . . Students will work rigorously through coaching sessions and on-camera exercises in order to readily showcase the dynamic aspects of their personalities and to be able to shine, showcase, and supersede the expectations of cast-mates, producers and audience ...\"</p> <p>Reminder: you live on this planet - and there are no escape pods. At present, the NYRTS curriculum can be taken as a five-week workshop, or tasted on a single night, which apparently begins with the class being instructed to dance unselfconsciously on film, while someone wanders around insulting them. </p> <p>The school is the brainchild of \"master coach\" Robert Galinsky, with other staff members, including an improv hag who advises: \"Never be embarrassed by anything you do\", and a casting expert who lists his credits as having worked \"with Abel Ferrara and Samsung\". Now that's a CV double act. Lost in Showbiz would like to work with John Waters and Chevrolet. Just because I've been on sets where people eat dog faeces, doesn't mean I don't want to drive a quality long-wheelbase vehicle. </p> <p>With the five- week course, the school presumably performs some sort of triage on the intake, dividing it up into people interested in test-driving lifemates, or people who'd be best majoring in island-based programming or whatever. But there's little doubt as to which man's shows these graduates would most like to end up on.</p> <p>In keeping with this column's commitment to introducing you to the faces of armageddon, you need to meet Mike Darnell, reality TV's ringleted \u00fcbermensch. Mike is Fox's president of Alternative Entertainment, and the cartographers gave up attempting to plot his boundaries a long time ago. Mike does not have limits. </p> <p>He is openly against accurate editing. He regards extreme plastic surgery as a plot driver. His single regret about airing Who's Your Daddy?, in which an adult adoptee had to pick her biological father from a line-up, was that the controversy generated \"was outside the programme - so it doesn't translate into ratings\". According to an interview he recently granted Reuters, Mike's favourite idea yet to make it to air is a \"female prison beauty pageant. It was done in Croatia and is a big number waiting to happen. It's empowering to women, it's empowering to prisoners. The whole idea of going from prisoner to hot babe is interesting.\"</p> <p>The title? Literally that: \"Female Prisoner Beauty Pageant.\" Here concludes your reality check. Feel free to medicate.</p>",
  "<p>Croatia is a \"small country for a big vacation\", as the ads tell you. But beyond the marketing and optimistic reports of millions of holidaymakers spending their \"big vacation\" there, there is less cheerful news, casting an unpleasant shadow over that small tourist paradise on the Adriatic. </p> <p>This summer Dinko Sakic, the 86-year-old former commander of Jasenovac, the notorious second world war concentration camp, was buried in his Ustashe uniform, the Croatian equivalent of the Nazis. After the war, Sakic emigrated to Argentina but returned after Croatian independence in 1991. He was welcomed back like a celebrity. In his interviews, Sakic repeated that he regretted nothing. What Sakic should have repented was that tens of thousands of inmates in Jasenovac were murdered under his command. He also personally executed two Jewish prisoners. Franjo Tudjman's government showed no will to put Sakic on trial until Israel signalled it was perfectly willing to try him there. So in 1998, Sakic was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years. At his funeral a Dominican priest, Vjekoslav Lasic gave a speech in which he advised Croats to admire Sakic and to take him as an example. </p> <p>Efraim Zuroff from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre protested to Croatian president Stjepan Mesic. There ended the scandal.</p> <p>Then, a few weeks ago, Zvonko Busic, a 62-year-old Croat who served 32 years in US prisons for terrorism, was welcomed at the Zagreb airport by pro-Ustashe supporters who hailed him with the traditional fascist salute. Busic had hijacked a TWA passenger plane in 1976 on the way from New York to Chicago, intending to throw leaflets describing the discrimination against Croats in Yugoslavia. A bomb planted at the same time by Busic at New York's Central Station exploded, a policeman was killed and three were wounded. But in Croatia he was considered a hero and a martyr \"for our cause\"; the victims, just a misfortune. He was compared to Begin, Arafat, Mandela, Che Guevara and Tito.</p> <p>As if this pair were not enough, the country has been further split by the pop singer Marko Perkovic Thompson, whose audiences, dressed in clothes adorned with Ustashe symbols, habitually raise their hands in a fascist salute - some even shout \"Kill Serbs\". Should his concerts, inciting nationalist hatred (which is forbidden by law) be banned or not? Recently President Mesic did not attend a tennis tournament because Thompson was due to play in the same town. However, the Croatian Helsinki Committee - for human rights! - defended the singer's right to perform. Mayors of Croatian cities are divided: for some, Thompson is a patriot; for others, a promotor of fascist values.</p> <p>It's interesting that the common denominator of these three is not only the rehabilitation of fascist ideology, but the apparent unwillingness of legal institutions such as the police and the public attorney's office to react to them. Indeed, how could they, when even some ministers attend Thompson's concerts?</p> <p>The dilemma of whether the law should be enforced or not is absurd. If anti-fascism is stated in the constitution of the new Croatian state, if the law prohibits the inciting of national, religious and racial hatred, then what's the problem? The problem is the Croatian attitude to its own past. Documents and declarations are one thing, but reality is another. In reality, before its 17 years of independence, Croatia was an independent state only once: between 1941 and 1945 - when it was ruled by a Nazi puppet government. </p> <p>This is the history that the Croatia of Franjo Tudjman fell back upon, and the same sentiments continue. In spite of political speeches denouncing episodic revivals of this infamous heritage, the general attitude here is that fighters for the \"national cause\" can not, by definition, be criminals. It is not the crime that counts, but the intentions behind it. This is the same logic that turns war criminals from the Balkan wars, such as Mirko Norac, into heroes. </p> <p>Croatian politicians, especially the prime minister Ivo Sanader, loudly promote European values and declare their commitment to join the EU. While such un-European behaviour as war crimes, terrorism and fascism might be legally banned, they are, in practice, tolerated and even nourished. Does the EU need this Croatia - a country that is showing the world only its pretty summer face, but keeping its dubious values hidden?</p> <p>\u2022 Slavenka Drakulic is the author of the book They Would Never Hurt a Fly - War Criminals on Trial in The Hague <br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Getting through the draw at a grand slam is a matter of picking your way across a series of stepping stones and they do not come much more slippery than Micha\u00ebl Llodra, the flashy Frenchman who gave Andy Murray a sizeable fright in the second round of the US Open yesterday before the Scot won 6-4, 1-6, 7-5, 7-6.</p> <p>As Murray had accurately indicated before the match, Llodra is a talented, mercurial player with a swerving left-handed serve, crisp and frequent volleys and flashy ground strokes. He is also a cussed soul who delights in drawing opponents into his strange and unpredictable patterns of play before so befuddling them that they do not see his more ferocious winners coming.</p> <p>There were times when he toyed with Murray, doing to him what the 21-year-old Scot usually does to other people by making every point a riddle rather than a rally. Murray's game, and his temper, looked frayed around the edges at times against the world No38 and when the match was over he belted the ball out of the stadium with such force that it might have caught the eye of a passing baseball scout from the adjacent Shea Stadium.</p> <p>\"I thought the whole match was very tough mentally and I thought I dealt with it pretty well,\" said Murray afterwards. \"I'm very happy with the win. He's got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher. He's definitely one of the top net players in the game. He'd give anyone a tough match. Very rarely does he lose easily to anyone.\"</p> <p>Giving up tennis and playing baseball instead might have seemed an appealing option for Murray at times yesterday, for an inability to deal with the Frenchman's tricky game pushed the Scot to the brink of his patience and beyond. He has worked hard to control and channel the competitive fire which burns whenever he takes to the court, and Llodra provided a stern test of just how good a job the Scot's team have done on keeping his composure.</p> <p>Managing emotions, though, means striking a balance between being too subdued and reining in the irascibility that has sometimes been Murray's undoing. He got that balance right yesterday, but only just, and the umpire, Carlos Bernardes, might not agree with that summation after feeling the Scot's wrath on several occasions, when the British No1 reacted with righteous indignation as line-calls went against him.</p> <p>Llodra also complained about the officiating, so Bernardes and his team must at least have been even-handed. \"I didn't let any of it linger too long,\" Murray pointed out. \"I said what needed to be said. It's not nice when you don't have confidence in the calls. You just want to be able to play.\"</p> <p>Unlike the Arthur Ashe stadium, the Grandstand court is not equipped with the HawkEye electronic line-calling system. If it had been it might have made Bernardes's job - and Murray's - a good deal easier.</p> <p>Murray began the match in efficient style, wrapping up the first set with a single break of serve which was enough to set him on course. It was all going very well - too well, perhaps. He became a little complacent and allowed his standard of play to drop markedly in the second set, when Llodra's serve began to bite. He had to save break points at the start of the third set but it galvanised him into action, and he seized on one of the more eccentric decisions in the third game of the same set to fire himself up. He worked himself up into a lather throughout the set, moreover, and when he pressured Llodra into dropping serve at 5-6 down he was at his most intense.</p> <p>Too intense, perhaps, for his form dipped again at the start of the fourth, a set in which he was twice a break down. Too often the Scot mirrored his opponent rather than keeping true to the sort of aggressive, deep hitting he managed against Sergio Roitman in the first round, but his returns were good enough to keep him in the set.</p> <p>He managed to elicit a match point on Llodra's serve late on but could not convert it and instead found himself in a tie-break during which he had to save two set points. After two hours and 33 minutes another match point arrived and he took it with relief as much as anything.</p> <p>Murray plays J\u00fcrgen Melzer tomorrow, armed with what he learned yesterday. The Austrian is another lefty but a less complex player than Llodra. Thankfully for Murray, the Frenchman is a one-off. </p>",
  "<p>The future of three controversial London 2012 Olympic venues hangs in the balance after the government ordered a review into their viability and value for money. Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, has called in the accountants KPMG to carry out a viability test on the proposed equestrian venue at Greenwich Park, the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich and the basketball venue on the main Olympic Park.</p> <p>All three have been criticised by local groups and sporting bodies over their cost, impact and legacy. Jowell said: \"We have commissioned KPMG to do a report on the equestrian, shooting and basketball venues, looking at whether the Olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money. When you take the costs for these venues, it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people. It is a sort of 'testing-to-destruction' to see whether that spending can be justified.\"</p> <p>Jowell said it was \"possible but unlikely\" the venues could be scrapped after the review, which is expected to take several months. The government is under pressure to keep costs down after the 2012 budget soared to \u00a39.3bn.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it was one of a number of ongoing reviews into efficiency, while the fact that the three venues in doubt are temporary and will not provide any legacy - a key plank of London's successful bid to host the Games - is also a prime concern.</p> <p>The 23,000-seater stadium in Greenwich Park would be removed after 2012 as would the 7,500-seater facilities at the Barracks, while the 12,000-seater basketball arena in the Olympic Park, which is to host the qualifying rounds, would be relocated after the finals, due to be held at the O2 Dome in Greenwich.</p> <p>Local groups have complained that Greenwich, which is part of a World Heritage Site and is London's oldest Royal Park, dating back to 1433, is an inappropriate place to host the equestrian event.</p> <p>The cost of the venues would not be revealed until contracts are agreed, but they are expected to total tens of millions of pounds. The Olympic authorities have already changed some venues, including fencing, while canoeing and the kayak slalom were switched to Broxbourne, north of London, after fears over high levels of water contamination.</p>",
  "<p>Fabio Capello was said to be angry last night after learning that Steven Gerrard needs a groin operation which will rule him out of England's first two World Cup qualifiers and being told by Sir Alex Ferguson that it would be \"impossible\" for Owen Hargreaves to replace the midfielder against Andorra and Croatia.</p> <p>The England manager is understood to have been shocked by news on Wednesday night that Gerrard needs surgery, having had no inkling of that from Liverpool. Although he accepts that the operation is necessary, an apparent lack of communication is believed to have upset him.</p> <p>Liverpool's manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, has said that the player went to this month's international against the Czech Republic with the problem and that Gerrard agreed on Tuesday, in conjunction with the club doctor, that he would need surgery after the following night's Champions League qualifier against Standard Li\u00e8ge.</p> <p>To add to Capello's problems, Ferguson is insisting Hargreaves cannot be considered by the England manager to fill in for Gerrard. Capello is in Monaco tonight and will see Hargreaves play his first game of the season when Manchester United face Zenit St Petersburg in the Super Cup. However, Ferguson believes it will be a wasted trip for Capello if the Italian is there exclusively to check on the midfielder.</p> <p>Hargreaves has been troubled by a persistent problem with tendinitis over the past 16 months and missed all of United's pre-season build-up. \"I think it is impossible for him to play for England,\" said Ferguson. \"That's my personal opinion. This will be his first start and I won't be playing him for the full game. It depends on how he feels at half-time, but it certainly won't be any more than an hour.</p> <p>\"He will have to have a recovery period. I think it will be very, very unlikely that Fabio would risk him. OK, they kick off the group against Andorra, but as they found out last time they struggled in that game. And then they have to go and play in Croatia. That is a very, very difficult match. You need players who are 100% match fit to play in a game of that nature.</p> <p>\"I don't think he is ready for that. In fact we know he is not ready for that. He will need to get a proper recovery, get proper training. If it wasn't such an important game you could say, 'Well, give him a bit of a game,' but I can't see it. It is too important for Capello and England.\"</p> <p>Capello, whose hitherto sound relationship with Premier League managers may be strained by this week's developments, could choose to call up Hargreaves and have him checked by England's medical team. The loss of Gerrard is certainly a blow to the Italian, who on Wednesday had been briefing Sunday newspaper reporters about his plans for the Liverpool captain. He is said to have learned about Gerrard's need for surgery in a call from Gary Lewin, the England physio, after Liverpool's game against Li\u00e8ge.</p> <p>Yesterday Capello's assistant, Franco Baldini, contacted Liverpool and Gerrard to clarify the extent of hisinjury after Ben\u00edtez's revelation that the midfielder needs an operation which will sideline him for \"10 to 15 days\". Ben\u00edtez initially said the surgery would be done yesterday, but it will proceed today.</p> <p>After confirmation from Gerrard that he has been playing in pain this season, there is an acceptance that surgery at some stage was unavoidable. A healthy relationship has tended to exist between the FA and Liverpool's medical department courtesy of Mark Waller, doctor to the club and to England Under-21s.</p> <p>Meanwhile, work on Liverpool's proposed new 60,000-seat stadium is expected to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn and the owners' struggle to raise at least ...#65533;\u00a3300m required to proceed with the project. The construction, which is estimated at more than...#65533;\u00a3400m, was due to start in October with a completion date set for the start of the 2011-12 season.</p> <p>Liverpool expect to tie up the loose ends of Albert Riera's proposed \u00a38m move from Espanyol today, with Spanish winger having been set a deadline of Friday by his club to finalise the move.</p>",
  "<p>Low-fare transatlantic airline <a href=\"http://www.flyzoom.com/\">Zoom</a> tonight suspended all operations and cancelled all flights after running into financial difficulties.</p> <p>The move began when the Canadian-UK carrier, which flew from five UK airports, had a plane detained at Calgary airport in Canada last night because of the financial problems.</p> <p>Today BAA prevented a Canada-bound Zoom aircraft from leaving Glasgow following an instruction from UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).</p> <p>BAA Glasgow said the matter concerned the non-payment of charges to European air traffic control company Eurocontrol and to the UK's air traffic control company, Nats.</p> <p>Zoom, which was founded by Scottish brothers John and Hugh Boyle, attempted to seek creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the UK and Canada with the hopes of being able to carry on flights.</p> <p>But tonight the airline said it had no option but to suspend all operations.</p> <p>The airline, which is based at Gatwick, employs 450 staff in Canada and 260 in the UK.</p> <p>Its flights operated from Gatwick, Glasgow, Manchester, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as Paris and Rome, to eight destinations in Canada, New York, San Diego, Fort Lauderdale and Bermuda.</p> <p>The Boyle brothers said tonight: \"We deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all Zoom operations.

  "<p>Children who receive a rich variety of home learning before they start school achieve measurably better results in maths tests at age 10, according to a major government-funded study into childhood learning.</p> <p>The researchers said the benefits of reading to a child, playing with numbers and shapes, teaching them nursery rhymes and taking them to the library are detectable on top of the influence of their parents' wealth and level of education.</p> <p>The study also found that children who attend quality preschool education do better at age 10. Previous results from the same study heavily influenced the government's decision to put into law in 2004 a requirement for local authorities to provide basic preschool education for 3 to 4 year olds. But the researchers said that more work needs to be done to improve the quality of that provision.</p> <p>Prof Edward Melhuish at Birkbeck, University of London, who led the research said the results showed that a combination of a good home learning environment, good preschool education and a good primary school were all important for later results. He said that without these benefits an average child from a poor background would be in the bottom 20% at school, but with all three advantages it would on average move into the top 20%.</p> <p>The Effective Provision of Pre-School Education Project has also shown the importance of home learning. \"There are plenty of mothers who aren't very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who don't provide such a good home environment,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What parents do is important irrespective of their own education,\" added co-author Prof Pam Sammons at the University of Nottingham, \"it's not just middle class children who do lots of reading.\"</p> <p>The study followed nearly 3000 children at over 800 primary schools from age 3 onwards. The team collected detailed information about the schools they attended, their socioeconomic background and their home environment. It is the largest study to look in such detail at the educational development of children in the general population. The new analysis, which is published in Science, focused on achievement in maths tests at age 10.</p> <p>\"The preschool experiences both at home and in the preschool itself had consequences for longer term development in maths achievement age 10,\" said Melhuish, \"This is the first study which demonstrates preschool effects that are long term in nature for the general population.\" Previously, some researchers believed that the benefits of preschool education were much more short-lived.</p> <p>Melhuish said the study strongly points to a need for universal high-quality preschool education. \"Clearly if you want to maximise the achievement of your population you should provide a high level of preschool education.\" He said that the Chinese government in particular had realised this and were investing heavily in preschool education. \"The politburo in China are not doing this for the love of the little kiddies. They are doing this because they recognise that it is an essential part of the infrastructure for a successful economy in the modern world.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every so often I feel the need to remind myself of the vast, improbable scale of America. For me, the only way to do this is to hit the road, seeing the extraordinary landscape and the great number of cultures that inhabit this land. </p> <p>So, with the political punditocracy camped out in Denver, I've gone on a road trip. While part of me wants to be in Colorado to hear the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/29/usa.barackobama\">headline speeches</a>, part of me is happy to be a day's hard drive away talking with ordinary people about their everyday concerns. I'm in the geographical centre of the country, more than a thousand miles from either coast.</p> <p>Over the last few days, I have driven from California through Arizona, New Mexico, the western counties of Oklahoma \u2013 the area made famous by the Santa Fe trail pioneers of the 1820s, made infamous by the Dust Bowl-era storms of the 1930s - and now west Texas. </p> <p>On Monday, I interviewed impoverished Navajo in Gallup, New Mexico, who live in houses that lack electricity and running water deep within the desert wildernesses of the Navajo Reservation and who can no longer afford to drive into town in their mud-spattered pick-ups to work minimum-wage jobs because of the spiralling cost of gasoline. On Tuesday, I talked with children and grandchildren of Dust Bowl-era Oklahomans \u2013 old timers, some of whom remembered their families living in dugouts (one room reinforced caves dug into the earth and housing entire families in the years surrounding Oklahoma's gaining of statehood in 1907) during the early 20th century. </p> <p>These men and women are tough folk. They are used to living on an inhospitable land, eking an existence out of the earth, and yet they increasingly struggle to make ends meet. In one tiny town I visited, Boise City, close to half of the families survive only by taking food donations from the little food pantry that operates out of an abandoned gas station on Main Street. One old lady told me of having to drive 120 miles each way to take her diabetic husband to his medical check-ups. The cost of gas left her so little extra money that the couple never went out anymore, other than to journey down to the food pantry.</p> <p>Another lady, who lived on a farm 13 miles outside the town of Guymon, explained how she and her husband had given up coming into town more than once a week. A third, who worked as a school secretary, told me of how a blizzard had damaged her home out in canyon country, and she had been unable to travel back and forth from Boise City to her house to repair it because she had so little spare money. And so, while she and her family camped out in a decommissioned movie theatre that they owned in town, their house had fallen into disrepair, and feral cats had eventually taken it over.</p> <p>The people I talked to are poor and rapidly getting poorer. They are watching their families and communities being battered by economic crises. If this were the 1930s, they'd be shoe-ins for FDR. These days, however, many are still thinking Republican. They're talking about <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/wire/ats-ap-candidates-religionaug27,1,4191233.story\">abortion</a>, which is why many of them voted for George Bush two times around, even though they think he's an ass when it comes to economics. And while they don't have much faith in John McCain's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/07/us/politics/07conservative.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/R/Religion%20and%20Belief\">conservative credentials</a>, they're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on this.</p> <p>They're nervous about Barack Obama being a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/28/false-obama-muslim-rumor_n_109740.html\">closet Muslim</a> - they've <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/27/AR2007012701097.html\">heard it on right-wing radio</a>, they've <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6314.html\">received emails warning them</a> of this - and, since religion is so central to their lives, they're reluctant to vote for someone who doesn't share their beliefs. Generally this reluctance is not quite as vicious in its formulation as out-and-out bigotry. Rather it's more a deep and insular fear of the unfamiliar. Finally, with a strong military legacy in many of these communities, they worry the young Democrat isn't qualified enough to be commander-in-chief during wartime. </p> <p>None of the people I talked with expressed concerns about Obama being African-American. And none of them gave me reason to believe they were lying about this. But the other concerns are nagging at them. They're just not sure he's ready for the White House. Some said they're still considering voting for Obama. Others made it clear they've made up their minds for McCain.</p> <p>To a person, they don't have a whole bunch of confidence that any incoming president will be able to do a whole lot to improve the country's economic situation, which is why they're willing to vote on \"morals\" instead of the bread-and-butter issues on which their parents and grandparents grounded their political decisions.</p> <p>Wednesday morning, in Guymon, I overheard two local men, grizzled old-timers, talking politics over a bacon and eggs breakfast at a local diner. \"I'll tell you one thing,\" said one of the men. \"Whoever becomes president, they're going to inherit so many problems, I don't envy them their jobs. They tried to get Colin Powell to run. I'd have voted for him. He was a respectable person who earned his way there. But the thing of it is he was too smart to run. He said, 'I ain't dragging my family into that shit.' I wish I could hear a little bit of good news today, because all they report is bad news.\"</p> <p>Last night, I drove south to Amarillo, a high-plains cattle town on the western fringe of Texas, and ate dinner at a steakhouse that easily seats 500 people, the walls adorned with stuffed bears, the heads of bison, elk and deer and huge hides stripped off of cattle. Three old men circulated round the tables, playing bluegrass requests on their fiddles. Enormous adverts announced that if you could eat a 72-ounce steak within an hour, the meat would be paid for by the house. There wasn't a television in the place, and had there been I would bet good money that the 10-gallon-hat eaters wouldn't have wanted it tuned to the Democratic National Convention goings-on.</p> <p>Out here, the convention is an awfully long way away. That doesn't mean people don't care about politics. But they have other things to worry about than watching the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/28/obama-invesco-speech-prep_n_122031.html\">convention theatrics</a>. Most have little to no spare money these days. And when they do, they want to enjoy themselves at places like the Big Texas steakhouse rather than watch political leaders preen on the national stage. Sure, the Clintons and Joe Biden have shown their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.democrats20086\">oratorical prowess</a> since Monday. Tonight, Obama will likely make a speech historic in its grandeur. If this were an election for orator-in-chief, the result would be a slam-dunk. But speechifying, alone, isn't going to clinch this election. </p> <p>From my perspective, from the centre of the country, the fat lady hasn't even started to think about singing yet.</p>",
  "<p>The opening ceremony of Beijing Olympics was a spectacle, but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/24/olympics20081?picture=336923619\">closing ceremony</a> slipped into uneasy chaos, with statist aesthetics and individualism clashing.</p> <p>The statist tone was present all around during the opening ceremony, revealing itself in every area and every detail. An example was the young boys and girls all with their hair plaited into the same braids, their bodies dressed in the same clothing and their faces and hands held in the same positions. The most visible of these, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/12/oly.kids/\">Lin Miaoke</a>, the young girl who sang Ode to the Motherland and was later found to have lip-synched, was nothing more than a statist symbol, utterly interchangeable with any other young girl. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0955443/\">Zhang Yimou</a> may have succeeded in realising this vision at the opening ceremony, but he didn't have total control of the closing ceremony, and thus the clash we saw was perhaps inevitable. The eight minutes given over to London embodied the concepts of humanism and an artistic freedom that exalts personal liberation. It presented to the world the vision of a vibrant, modern and urban culture. The performances during these eight minutes were light, free, dynamic, modern, creative and full of imagination, with individual performers' faces revealing their genuine delight. By contrast, the Chinese spectacle was stern, orderly, reserved, unimaginative, dignified but dull. This is the difference between individual and statist aesthetics, and a profound contrast between the fundamental philosophies of east and west.</p> <p>If the contrast between London and us doesn't yet merit the word \"clash\", look at the third chapter of the closing ceremony, dubbed \"rejoicing\". When all the grand narratives were dispelled, the statist aesthetic withered. Indeed, when the announcer said the word \"I\" the audience suddenly felt very uncomfortable. The performers from mainland China, not yet used to total personal freedom, appeared strained and cramped. Asked to completely let themselves go and rejoice, they could only dissolve into the chaos.</p> <p>Here, the statist aesthetic ran into difficulty. The closing ceremony called for a light, happy, all-inclusive party, something quite common in individualistic and unfettered cultures. Next to the mainland performers, the Hong Kong artists looked noticeably more at ease.</p> <p>The public had previously called upon the artistic community within the establishment to throw off the shackles of regimented style favoured by the state. But, having been presented with an opportunity like the closing ceremony, these same artists were at a loss as they should how to proceed.

  "<p>European Union leaders will discuss sanctions against Russia ahead of an emergency summit meeting, the French foreign minister said today, as western leaders increased diplomatic pressure on Moscow.</p> <p>When asked what measures the west could take against Russia in the crisis over Georgia, Bernard Kouchner told a press conference in Paris: \"Sanctions are being considered.\"</p> <p>He gave no details, but the threat reflects western impatience at Moscow after its invasion of Georgia and its recognition of Georgia's breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as independent.</p> <p>Despite Kouchner's comments, it will not be easy to reach consensus on sanctions within the EU as some states will be unwilling to jeopardise mutually beneficial relations with Moscow. In particular, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is unlikely to support any moves that could damage relations and interrupt the flow of gas and oil to Europe.</p> <p>It is the first time that France, which prides itself on good relations with Moscow, has raised the possibility of sanctions or other measures in the standoff between the west and Russia.</p> <p>\"I do not want to prejudge the issue before the EU summit on Georgia has taken place,\" Kouchner said. \"But we will work hard with our 26 partners to draft a strong statement that signifies our refusal to accept the situation in Georgia. France does not support breaking off relations with Russia. This will have to be sorted out through negotiation. This will take time, we are not deluding ourselves.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the EU is not contemplating the type of sanctions imposed on Iran or Zimbabwe, which include arms embargoes and travel bans. But the EU is likely to postpone talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with Russia scheduled for September, or at the extreme, break them off indefinitely. Similarly, France, which is scheduled to host a biannual meeting of the EU-Russia council in Nice in November, may decide it is not the time to roll out the red carpet for the Russians.</p> <p>Recent moves to forge security ties with Russia appear doomed. Moscow has expressed interest in having a role in attempts to forge a common European defence policy. Russia had offered the use of helicopters to the EU as an incentive for being included.</p> <p>On the economic front, analysts speculated the EU could take a closer look at the activities of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant in Europe. Gazprom gets 70% of its profits from sales to EU countries, and the size of the market gives the EU important leverage. The flipside is that Europe, particularly Germany, depends heavily on these supplies.</p> <p>As to support for Georgia, the EU could improve visa access for its citizens, give Tbilisi greater trace access to the EU, or hold an EU-Georgia summit.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, dismissed the idea of sanctions as the product of a \"sick imagination\".</p> <p>\"My friend Kouchner also said that we will soon attack Moldova and Ukraine and the Crimea ... But that is a sick imagination and probably that applies to sanctions as well,\" he told reporters at a security meeting in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. \"I think it is a demonstration of complete confusion.\"</p> <p>France, which brokered a ceasefire between Russia and Georgia, has called an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Monday to discuss the most serious rupture between Russia and the west since the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Russia failed to get the robust support it was seeking from its allies on the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a security group that includes China and that Russia help set up. After a meeting in Dushanbe, attended by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, the group condemned the use of force and called for respect for every country's territorial integrity. </p> <p>\"The SCO states express grave concern in connection with the recent tensions around the South Ossetian issue and urge the sides to solve existing problems peacefully, through dialogue, and to make efforts facilitating reconciliation and talks,\" the final declaration said.</p> <p>Britain said it would not accept the redrawing of Europe into spheres of influence. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said such concepts were \"anathema\" and belonged to the second world war era of Yalta. He rejected the argument that Nato was an offensive alliance seeking to encircle Russia.</p> <p>The 1945 agreement at the Yalta conference, between the leaders of Britain, the US and the Soviet Union, saw the allied powers accept that eastern Europe fell into Moscow's sphere of influence.</p> <p>Miliband's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme followed a tough statement signed by himself and the foreign ministers of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan deploring Moscow's \"excessive use of military force\" in Georgia.</p> <p>The statement, described as an \"unprecedented step\" by the Foreign Office, followed a warning from Miliband delivered in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to Medvedev that he bore a \"big responsibility\" not to provoke a new cold war.</p> <p>The foreign ministers said Moscow's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violated Georgia's integrity and sovereignty. \"We ... condemn the action of our fellow G8 member. Russia's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN security council resolutions supported by Russia.\"</p> <p>In his interview, Miliband rejected the notion that his visit to Ukraine had been provocative. He said he went there because it was important to say to a friendly country that \"we support their democratic choices\". The foreign secretary reiterated Britain's support for Ukraine's wish to be in Nato and rebuked Russia for treating its neighbours as if they were either \"enemies or vassals\".</p> <p>Miliband, tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister, went to Kiev to deliver a speech flying the flag of western democracy on Russia's doorstep, while seeking to avert a new crisis on the Crimean peninsula, home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow's Black Sea fleet.</p> <p>The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years, delivered in a country that is Russia's neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation.</p> <p>Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe's relations with Russia, ending nearly two decades of relative tranquillity. He said Tuesday's decision by Medvedev to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe.</p> <p>\"[Medvedev's] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance,\" Miliband said. \"It is not just the end of the post-cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe. It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>BIG CUP DRAW! BIG CUP DRAW! BIG CUP DRAW!</strong></p> <p>As the Fiver went to press, some middle-aged grey, bespectacled men in suits had just finished a gluttonous lunch and were rummaging around in the pots of balls to decide which teams would face each other in the first round group stages of Big Cup. Confirm your suspicions that Manchester United will get drawn against the Cypriot Team, the Belarusian team and Basingstoke Town Second XI in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/28/championsleague\">Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report</a>.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE HITHERTO UNDISCOVERED GENIUS OF STEVEN GERRARD</strong></p> <p>Standard Liege may have spurned 173 decent scoring chances at Anfield last night, but the real stars were Big Cup hopefuls Liverpool, who showcased their party pieces for all of Europe to see. Yossi Benayoun cut inside from the flank! Dirk Kuyt cut inside from the flank! Fernando Torres went out to the flank, then cut inside! Yes! Yes! Oh yes!</p> <p>But they weren't the only tactical masterstrokes made by Rafael Benitez, the genius who turned the 2005 Big Cup final at half-time by trying to substitute Steve Finnan for Dietmar Hamann <em>and</em> Djinkin' Djibril Cisse. Xabi Alonso hoofed it long, high over Torres's head! $tevie Mbe hoofed it long, high over Torres's head - and into the stands! Alvaro Arbeloa was detailed to play the entire match sliding across the turf in the wrong direction on his top lip - and only fell a mere heartbreaking three minutes short of achieving his goal!</p> <p>Though in truth Liverpool's showboating wasn't <em>quite</em> as impressive as the Fiver makes it sound, they're in the draw for today's Big Cup Proper, and everyone at Anfield is happy enough with that. \"We will get better little by little,\" promised Benitez today, gaffer-taping a metal bar to his spine. \"I think there was a slight improvement on our previous games,\" added Mbe with a manic insistence as, disconcertingly, his eyes began to boggle around in their sockets like Ged's used to.</p> <p>\"I think you have to give them credit,\" added Mbe, handing Liege almost as much praise as he did possession last night. \"It was a bit too close for comfort but we're just pleased that we're through.\" Mbe then did the smartest thing he's done all season - he sodded off for some exploratory surgery on his persistent groin knack, thus ensuring he won't get the blame when Liverpool lose 1-0 at home to Manchester United next week.

We travelled to Manchester today and won a tremendous victory. Young Tevez a revelation, he has a curious slack-jawed aspect but is a fine player for someone not born in the Empire. What is strange about this land is that although far to the north, most of the natives speak as if they are from the Home Counties.</p> <p>August 8 2007: Dreadful news. Tevez has been moved to Manchester. A fearful blow, but have recruited Craig Bellamy, Fredrik Ljungberg, Kieron Dyer, Julien Faubert and Nolberto Solano. With a reliable crew like this we will make the ninth place yet!</p> <p>January 2008: Intolerable conditions. Faubert, Ljungberg, Dyer and Solano have succumbed to dropsy, scurvy, mania, Elephantiasis, Sweating Disease and Western Itch. Our advance scout Ashton is only able to advance at 4mph, and that's at a fair clip. Mustn't show my strain to the crew: the only solution is to stand on the sidelines, expressionless, doing my best to look vertically dead.</p> <p>May 2008: Have managed to drop anchor in 10th place, more than respectable in times past, but I fear the natives will not take this even though we are a crew of modest means and have been ravaged with injuries and every other club in the Premier League is owned by some billionaire with \u00a3500m to burn on getting his club an Intertoto place.</p> <p>August 27 2008: More sad events. Anton Ferdinand was last seen wandering to the far north. I fear we will not see him again.</p> <p>August 28 2008: Madness. The natives have been yammering outside my tent all night despite the fact that we beat Macclesfield 4-1. I have issued this statement; \"I understand the responsibility that comes with being West Ham manager but the supporters have to realise the effect it has when they're not behind us.\" We will never see ninth place.

  "<p>The headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s old secondary school in Fife has emerged as the front-runner to become <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a>'s candidate for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a>. </p> <p>Lindsay Roy, the head of Kirkcaldy high school, is regarded by senior figures in the local Labour party as a powerful candidate and the most likely to prevent the Scottish National party from humiliating Brown by winning the once-safe Labour seat next to his own constituency. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">SNP</a> is currently favourite to win Glenrothes, which borders Brown's seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, after the party overturned Labour's 13,500-vote majority in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East</a> last month. </p> <p>Some observers believe a nationalist victory in Fife would fatally damage Brown's premiership.</p> <p>Roy, a friend of the prime minister for 18 years, confirmed to the Guardian today he was putting himself forward as a candidate at next Monday night's selection meeting, but denied speculation that Brown had personally asked him to stand. </p> <p>He indicated, however, that the prime minister had indirectly urged him to volunteer. It is believed Brown used an intermediary such as Alex Rowley, the Labour group leader on Fife council, a former general secretary of the Scottish Labour party and Brown's closest ally in Fife. </p> <p>\"I have been asked by the people of my community and people in the Labour party in my community to consider standing. There has been no direct approach from Gordon Brown,\" Roy said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Tory leader, David Cameron, challenged the prime minister to campaign in person in Glenrothes, as the Scottish Tory party announced it had selected Maurice Golden, who contested the Holyrood seat of Central Fife last year and is environment campaigns manager for Keep Scotland Beautiful, as its candidate. </p> <p>\"I hope that Gordon Brown will rise to the challenge of campaigning in his own back yard so that the voters can see for themselves the choices on offer,\" Cameron said. \"It is time for him to stop running scared and to stand up and be counted. I will be in Glenrothes. Will he?\" </p> <p>There had been speculation since the death of the sitting Labour MP, John MacDougall, earlier this month that party officials were trying to persuade Henry McLeish, the former Scottish first minister and former local Labour MP, to stand. </p> <p>But there were significant doubts that Brown wanted McLeish to stand and <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/19/glenrothes.scotland1\">McLeish has since ruled himself out</a>, leaving Labour facing the difficult task of finding a candidate strong enough to counter the SNP's popularity in Fife. </p> <p>While several well respected local councillors and MSPs have been mentioned, senior Labour figures doubted whether they had the right calibre for the contest or would be vulnerable to SNP attacks on Labour's record in government.</p> <p>Roy was brought in as a \"troubleshooter\" to run Kirkcaldy high school by the SNP-led council in May after the school was criticised by the school inspectorate for its poor exam results, indiscipline and low staff morale. The secondary school has also been the focus of an anti-knives campaign and has its own dedicated police officer.</p> <p>Labour sources said today that Roy had addressed staff at the school yesterday to tell them he expected to be nominated for the seat. </p> <p>A Labour party member said to have a strong base in the constituency, Roy was made a CBE for his services to education in 2004. He is also a lay inspector for HM inspectorate of education in Scotland. </p> <p>His last school, Inverkeithing High, received a glowing report from the inspectors.</p> <p>One senior source who once worked with Roy said he had \"formidable energy\" and was known to get to his desk at 6am, working for up to 15 hours a day. \"His commitment is absolutely unbelievable,\" he said. \"I think he would make a very, very good candidate. I think he will turn it.\"</p> <p>Brown praised the school when he became prime minister last year, citing its one-time school motto \u2013 \"I will do my utmost\" \u2013 and stating: \"I wouldn't be standing here without the opportunities I got there.\"</p> <p>Brown was fast-tracked at the school, which was close to his father's church, by being put in classes a year ahead of his age group \u2013 a decision Brown which later said he regretted because it took away from his immediate peers.</p> <p>The local party is expected to choose Labour's candidate on Monday and if he is selected, Roy will face Peter Grant, currently the SNP leader of Fife council. Although he would defend a 10,664 vote majority, he faces a tough task. </p> <p>Since it became clear that John MacDougall was suffering from terminal cancer, the SNP has been quietly very active in the constituency preparing for the byelection. </p> <p>After winning the comparable seat at Holyrood and taking control of Fife council in the Scottish elections last year, the SNP is still clear favourite to win. A number of opinion polls this year give the SNP a clear lead over Labour, in both Holyrood and Westminster votes.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats have selected Harry Wills, a local businessman. The party hope to repeat their shock victory in the Dunfermline and West Fife byelection in 2006, when Willie Rennie overcame a 11,562 majority for Labour.</p>",
  "<p>The latest Electoral Commission <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/62185/EA-report-UK-2008-08-20-CYMK-Embargoed-final-web.pdf\">report (pdf)</a> comes at a time when the government seems preoccupied with moving polling day to a <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/cp1308.htm \">weekend</a>, postal, internet and phone voting, and even entering voters into prize draws rather than addressing serious concerns regarding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/13/uk.localgovernment\">electoral fraud</a>.</p> <p>While I have some concerns about this report, in particular its recommendations for a network of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/electoralreform\">electoral management boards</a>, I am all in favour of simplifying electoral law and having a more coordinated and professional electoral registration service.</p> <p>But the report only briefly touches on the much bigger problem. Contrary to reports in the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4615384.ece\">Times</a> today, it does not call for more stringent security measures (although the commission has done so in the past). Earlier this year, the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust published a <a href=\"http://www.jrrt.org.uk/recent-publications.html\">damning report</a> on the extent of voter fraud in Britain today. Specifically, it called for the introduction of individual voter registration and for voters to provide photo ID at polling stations, as is already the case in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Compare and contrast that with the current system in Great Britain. As many as 3.5 million people are unregistered, whilst millions of people are registered more than once. In 2004, the Daily Mail successfully registered the fictional <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=30404&amp;sectioncode=1\">Gus Troobev</a> (an anagram of \"bogus voter\") on 31 separate electoral registers during a single day. More recently, a mother has just been cautioned by police for <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_stneots/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=342679\">registering her two daughters</a>, aged 12 and 16 respectively, to vote in last year's local elections. If it weren't so serious it would be laughable.</p> <p>Currently, there are no proper safeguards in place to prevent people's votes being stolen at the polling station in the UK. Voters are just asked for their name and address as means of ID. These are a matter of public record, so what is to stop someone from stealing my vote? But whilst <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7583000/7583539.stm\">acknowledging</a> how well the system works in Northern Ireland, the electoral commission has stopped short of calling for it in the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The reason for this is probably the mess that the government has made of its national identity card scheme and its repeated failure to keep <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/24/justice.conservatives\">personal data secure</a>. This is a red herring, however. In Northern Ireland, the only people who need an electoral ID card are people who lack any other form of photographic identity such as a passport, driving licence or senior citizen's bus pass. It does not contain any information about the carrier and certainly does not hold any biometric data. Indeed, while compulsory ID cards could also be used in this way, the government's scheme is a decade away from completion and both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have pledged to scrap it. We do not have years to wait \u2013 we need action now.</p> <p>With over 40 convictions on voter fraud since 2000, including in <a href=\"http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/Special-Report--How-police.4328536.jp\">Peterborough</a> last month, it really is time both the Electoral Commission and the government made this a priority.</p>",
  "<p>A four-day battle in southern Afghanistan involving US coalition and Afghan forces has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 militants, the coalition said today.</p> <p>Militants with rocket-propelled grenades, guns and mortars attacked the joint patrol in the province of Helmand on a number of occasions between Monday and today, the coalition said. The combined force called in fighter aircraft for support.</p> <p>Captain Scott Miller, a coalition spokesman, said he could not provide further details, including a more precise location of the fighting, because the battle was continuing.</p> <p>The coalition statement said no Afghan, coalition or civilian casualties had been reported.</p> <p>The large death toll comes almost a week after the US said it killed 25 militants and five civilians during an operation in the Shindand district of Herat province. </p> <p>Afghan officials, however, say between 76 and 90 Afghan civilians were killed in that operation last Friday and called for more control over airstrikes. The US is investigating and plans to make its findings public.</p> <p>Claims of large death tolls made by international forces or Afghan officials are almost impossible to independently verify because of the remote and dangerous locations of the battles</p> <p>In other violence, a roadside bomb killed a US coalition soldier in southern Afghanistan on a patrol on Wednesday. Details of the soldier's nationality or the location of the attack have not been released.</p> <p>In the Nad Ali area of Helmand province, a fight between police and militants resulted in the deaths of 14 insurgents on Wednesday, said Daud Ahmedi, the governor's spokesman.</p> <p>More than 3,700 people, mostly militants, have died in insurgency-related violence so far this year according to an Associated Press tally of figures provided by Afghan and western officials.</p>",
  "<p>A documentary about the race to be mayor of Newark, New Jersey may not sound worth 83 minutes of your time, but Marshall Curry's Oscar-nominated film is a little gem, a cool look at a very uncool battle, which seems a little closer to Mugabe v Tsvangirai than Boris v Ken. Curry sets out to film both candidates, young law school graduate Cory Booker and long-serving incumbent Sharpe James, but the latter prevents access even to the streets and Curry's camera view is frequently obscured by the big hand of authority. This is a race between two African-American Democrats (local US politics being apparently non-denominational) but could hardly be more bitterly fought. James, mayor for 16 years, seems happy to make any claim against his opponent that might stick, up to and including \"faggot white boy\" (the Obama-ish Booker is lighter-skinned), Jewish and a Republican. Amid rising paranoia and intimidation, Booker's chief of staff is busted and his campaign HQ burgled. As the election nears, power failures occur, police are filmed pulling down Booker posters and pro-Booker businesses lose city contracts. Curry's film is sharply edited and provides a vital example of old-style, street-level realpolitik. And, since the result is unknown to us, it has real narrative momentum. Most Brits know New Jersey only from The Sopranos; this is hardly less dramatic or more democratic.</p>",
  "<p>Jia Zhangke's lead characters wander about in some bewilderment. One is a man searching for a wife he hasn't seen for 16 years and the daughter he has never met; another is a wife looking for a husband she hasn't spoken to for two years. If they seem displaced, so is almost everyone in the film, which takes place amid frantic demolition. It's set on the banks of the Yangtze, Asia's longest river, and site of the Three Gorges Dam project, which will be the world's largest hydro-electric power station and will displace an estimated 1.2 million Chinese people. This is literally a disappearing world. Hence a melancholy and surreal feeling to a film where you keep looking behind its unassuming characters to backgrounds changing as you watch to a human onslaught of hammering and battering. Jia adds to the unreality with a building that collapses in the background and another oddly shaped one which suddenly takes off into the sky like a rocket and, in the film's final scene, a tightrope walker between buildings just discernible in the background. Jia's action requires some patience, as there isn't much of it, but an insight into the real China and its inhabitants, who still smoke like it's 40s Hollywood, is intermittently fascinating. </p>",
  "<p>Last Monday, Nepal's Maoist leader Kamal Dahal, known as \"Prachanda\", was sworn in as the <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g6b4viDUIDK4B00sdAUKXuvjbKPA\">first prime minister</a> of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, having won an overwhelming vote in the constituent assembly elected in April. The assembly's opening action had been to vote almost unanimously to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy, and in June ex-king Gyanendra Shah <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/2008/06/12/top10.htm\">departed the palace</a>, to remain in the country as an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/world/asia/12briefs-DEPOSEDKINGL_BRF.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss\">ordinary citizen</a>.</p> <p>Nepal fleetingly made headlines after the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/1/newsid_3987000/3987183.stm\">2001 palace massacre</a> of the previous monarch and his family: its <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6290473.stm\">10-year civil war</a> was seldom in the international limelight. So too, the country's unique peace process has rarely gained outside attention since the guns fell silent two years ago. Yet amid too many continuing conflicts and failing peace processes, a success story deserves to be recognised and supported.</p> <p>I came to Nepal in mid-2005, when the human rights violations committed by both sides to the armed conflict, together with the crackdown on democratic rights as the king seized absolute power, led the international community to support a <a href=\"http://nepal.ohchr.org/en/index.html\">monitoring presence</a> of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. With no end in sight to a war with thousands of civilian victims, and democracy far from the horizon, nobody could have foreseen how the people of Nepal would express their demand for peace and change. The turning point was the April 2006 people's movement, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets, for <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/nepal-solidarity-brings-prospect-permanent-peace-20060614\">19 successive days</a>. The king was compelled to hand power back to the political parties, and the peace agreement that emerged ended the conflict, bringing the Maoists into an interim parliament and government, and promising elections for a constituent assembly.</p> <p>The April 2006 people's movement also took the lid off social pressures often disregarded by the power elites. Although established as a unitary Hindu kingdom, with politics directed from the Himalayan foothills, today around half the population live in the fertile southern plains and more than one-third are from over 50 indigenous largely non-Hindu communities. Others are also historically marginalised from the social and political life of the nation, notably the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=27700&amp;Cr=Nepal&amp;Cr1=\">Dalits</a>, known sometimes as \"untouchables\", at the bottom of the Hindu caste system. </p> <p>The restoration of democracy was for these groups a step towards wide-ranging social transformation, enabling them to participate more equally in the life of the country. Given that the election system for the constituent assembly needed to ensure their representation, a complex system of quotas was devised. Along with the success of socially diverse candidates fielded by the Maoists, the constituent assembly elected in April comprises unprecedented representation of marginalized groups.</p> <p>Women, too, had been almost invisible in the political life of the capital, and indeed in the peace process itself. Now nearly one-third of the constituent assembly members are women \u2013 taking Nepal to first place in South Asia, and 14th place in the world league table of women's representation in nationally elected bodies.</p> <p>The challenges that face Prime Minister Prachanda, the coalition government that is about to be formed, and the constituent assembly, are immense. The Nepali political actors have shown an extraordinary capacity to maintain dialogue and work through their differences, but trust among them is fragile \u2013 the Nepali Congress party has chosen to remain in opposition, dubious of the Maoists' commitment to democratic politics.</p> <p>Nowhere in the world is the transformation of an armed insurgent group into a peaceful political movement quick or easy. The Maoists enter the new government still with their own army \u2013 confined to cantonments, with their weapons stored under UN monitoring \u2013 and a Young Communist League that has persistently acted outside the law. Commitments to resolve the future of the Maoist combatants, alongside what the peace agreements call the \"democratisation\" of the state army, must now be implemented. Another hurdle is to promote respect for the rule of law and address impunity: none of the human rights abuses \u2013 killings, disappearances or torture \u2013 by either side of the conflict has been effectively prosecuted.</p> <p>The biggest challenges are those that address the roots of the insurgency: poverty, injustice and discrimination. One of the costs of the conflict has been the retreat of local governance and arrested development in a desperately poor country where over 80% of the population lives in rural districts. As Nepal aspires to becoming a federal democratic republic, expectations are high among diverse groups for greater control of their lives and resources. What federalism means in practice, taking account of the geographic and ethnic peculiarities of Nepal, is an elusive and potentially divisive concept. Reaching a national consensus will be a formidable task for the assembly, and meanwhile the Nepali people cannot wait until a new constitution is drafted to see real improvements in their daily lives.</p> <p>Nepal's peace process has been truly indigenous: it has not been mediated or managed by any external third party. The UN has encouraged and facilitated the process \u2013 through quiet good offices during the last years of the conflict, through human rights monitoring, through assistance during the assembly election, and through monitoring the arms and armies during the transition. The Maoist and non-Maoist parties have asked the UN to maintain a political presence while the issue of the former combatants is resolved, and we stand ready to support peacebuilding, recovery and long-term development. From Delhi to Washington, from Brussels to Tokyo, the international community must be generous and steady in assisting Nepal to sustain the still fragile success of a remarkable peace process.</p>",
  "<p>Fresh violence in China's restive north-west region of Xinjiang has left two police dead and seven injured, officials have said.</p> <p>There were three fatal attacks on police and government targets just before and during the Olympics - including the worst militant attack in a decade.</p> <p>Officials gave few details of yesterday's incident in Jiashi county, 60 miles east of Kashgar. An Uighur exile group said gunfire was heard.</p> <p>A public security official told the Associated Press news agency that eight Uighurs were involved but only one had been captured.</p> <p>A hospital in Kashgar said it was treating seven officers, including one with stab wounds, while a Communist party official in Jiashi county said two police had died.</p> <p>On August 4 in Kashgar, attackers ran down police with a truck before stabbing them and throwing grenades, killing 16. Six days later, police said 10 bombers targeted sites in Kuqa and were killed along with a security guard and a bystander.</p> <p>No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but local officials have said Uighur separatists are trying to bring about a \"year of mourning\" in China.</p> <p>Turkic-speaking Muslim Uighurs make up around half of the vast region's 19 million people. There has been some separatist violence in the past, though human rights and exile groups have accused authorities of using such attacks to justify cracking down on peaceful political and cultural expression.</p> <p>\"A lot of Uighurs are going to pay a price for these attacks. This is a vicious circle, because people are then further disenfranchised and radicalised and Chinese services in turn are more repressive because of separatist sentiment,\" said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, said a handful of terrorists were attempting to split China. \"People of various ethnic groups coexist in harmony and equality, and the situation in Xinjiang is generally good,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the Uighur people.\"</p> <p>Dilxat Raxit, an activisit and spokesman for the Germany-based World Uighur Congress, said local Uighurs had reported \"fierce gunfire\" and large-scale arrests. He said authorities were widening a crackdown in the area.</p> <p>Andrew Gilholm, a senior China analyst at the Control Risks consultancy, warned of the potential for \"an extended period of attacks and raids\". But he said the terrorism risk for the rest of China remained low.</p>",
  "<p>The launch of a controversial new government database containing details of every child in the country is to be delayed for technical reasons, it was revealed today.</p> <p>ContactPoint, a \u00a3224m computer system carrying personal information about all under-18s, was due to come online in April this year. It will now be delayed until January next year, children's minister Kevin Brennan said today.</p> <p>This is the second time the index's start date has been put back. Concerns over data security following the loss of child benefit details by HM Revenue and Customs forced officials to delay its coming online from April to October.</p> <p>Officials from the Department for Children, Schools and Families said that the delay was not about \"security\" issues, but user issues such as drop-down menus.</p> <p>The spokeswoman said: \"We are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users. This is not about security issues.\"<br> David Laws, the Lib Dem children's spokesman, condemned the whole project. \"Instead of delaying the launch of the database, this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether.</p> <p>\"A recent independent review has already undermined all of the government's assurances that the database will be secure. The discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future. The government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data. Parents have every right to demand that their children's personal details are not put at risk.\"</p> <p>Last year senior social workers wrote to government officials outlining their \"significant\" concerns that the database, containing the address, medical and school details of all under-18s, could be used to harm the children whom it is intended to protect.</p> <p>The personal details will be available to an estimated 330,000 vetted users. Some of those allowed to check records, such as headteachers, doctors, youth-offender workers and social workers, are uncontroversial, but critics have questioned why other potential users, such as fire and rescue staff, will have access to the database.</p> <p>ContactPoint, which is costing \u00a3224m to build and a further \u00a341m a year to run, was set up after the official report into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. Lord Laming concluded that the eight-year-old's murder could have been prevented had there been better communication between professionals.</p> <p>A House of Lords select committee warned last month that \"the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security, and of deliberate misuse of the data \u2026 which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute\".</p> <p>Concerns increased with the admission that, while every child under 18 in England will have a record, some children, such as the offspring of some politicians and celebrities, could be left off the main database.</p> <p>Children's rights campaigners say that this amounts to an acknowledgment that the database will not be secure and computer security experts say that with such widespread access it would be virtually impossible to stop individuals misusing the information. </p> <p>Maria Miller, the shadow families minister, said: \"This looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government. We repeatedly warned the government of the problems with ContactPoint but they pressed ahead regardless, ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out. </p> <p>\"There were clear indications in February of significant security concerns with this database. Only now, with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live, have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems. Ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because children's personal information is at risk.\"</p>",

In this case, it includes <a href=\"http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/\">Acid2-compliance</a> and moves to support draft standards such as HTML 5 Draft DOM Storage standard and the Web API Working Group's Selectors API.</p> <p>Beta 2 includes <strong>Web Slices</strong>, which arrived in beta 1. Microsoft says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Developers can mark parts of Web pages as Web Slices and enable users to monitor information they rely on as they move about the Web. With a click in the Favorites bar, users see rich Web Slice visuals and developers establish a valuable end-user connection.</p> </blockquote> <p>For example, eBay is using Web Slices. The basic idea is that when part of a page changes -- eg someone makes a bid -- a notification button lights up. You don't have to go to a page to see if it has changed, and it's less geeky than subscribing to an RSS feed.</p> <p>The main changes for ordinary users include greatly <strong>enhanced Find</strong> (with, at last, results highlighted) and the so-called \"porn mode,\" <strong>InPrivate browsing</strong>. This lets you visit your bank account or whatever without storing any URLs, passwords, temporary files etc -- though you can opt to retain the cookie. Another welcome if late addition is <strong>Reopen last browsing session</strong>, for which many multiple-tab users have adopted IE7Pro crash-protection.</p> <p>There's a <strong>Compatibility View</strong> button for use with sites designed to work with IE7.</p> <p>Another welcome feature is <strong>Per-site ActiveX</strong>, which includes <strong>Per-user ActiveX</strong>. One reason why Firefox was more secure than IE was that Mozilla never implemented ActiveX support, and therefore Firefox failed to work with any ActiveX sites. (This is like avoiding car-jacking by leaving your car in the garage. It works, but still....) Unfortunately, ActiveX is too heavily used on intranets for Microsoft to be able to dump it, but per-site control is a good compromise. Users will be able to block it everywhere except for the couple of sites that may still require it.... and parents will be able to block it on their kids' accounts.</p> <p>The enhanced security features include a <strong>SmartScreen filter</strong> to improve phishing protection (Safari please copy), a <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter</strong>, and <strong>Data execution prevention (DEP)</strong> turned on by default.</p> <p>Finally, corporate users get \"more than 100 new Group Policy settings\" to provide even more fine-grained control of their users' browsers from the DP centre.</p> <p>There's more about Beta 2 at the <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/08/27/internet-explorer-8-beta-2-now-available.aspx\">IE Team Blog</a>, and Microsoft's press office has a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/windows/factsheets/IE8FS.mspx\">Fact Sheet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/gallery/screenshots/windows.mspx#EPMAC\">screen shots</a>.</p> <p>Microsoft fell a long way behind in browser features and standards support by taking five years off, but IE8 beta 2 seems to get it more or less back in the pack. Since it's almost two years since IE7 came out (October 19, 2006), one can only say \"about time, too\". But there are still plenty of sleepyheads on IE6.....</p>",
  "<p>\"History will judge!\" were the bullish words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Kouchner\">Bernard Kouchner</a>, the French foreign minister, in response to <a href=\"http://www.russiaprofile.org/author_biography.php?author=Konstantin+Kosachev\">Konstantin Kosachev</a>, president of the Russian Duma foreign affairs committee, who warned that \"You are absolutely wrong on Kosovo. It is a terrible precedent\", during a press conference earlier this year following Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence. With Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/russia.georgia1\">signing a decree</a> on the independence of Georgia's break-away provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the judgments of history are likely to be delivered far sooner than Kouchner and others expected. </p> <p>By relying upon reiterations of \"uniqueness\" to justify their recognition of Kosovo's independence, the US and a majority of EU member states have ensured that appeals to respect the territorial integrity of Georgia sound both hollow and hypocritical, particularly President Bush's <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-08-26-Russia-Georgia_N.htm?csp=23&amp;RM_Exclude=aol\">insistence</a> that \"Georgia's territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nation's, including Russia's\". An international system defined by such arbitrary reiterations of \"uniqueness\", as opposed to universal principles, is always going to be vulnerable to contrived acts of imitation. The miscalculation of Kosovo is now, with conscious Russian assistance, recoiling back onto its instigators.</p> <p>In collapsing the distinction between international law and politics, those who supported Kosovo's independence have opened up a Pandora's box of mutual recognitions and assertions of sovereignty, with damaging repercussions for both regional and global security. By discarding the ideas of compromise, accommodation and reintegration, support for dividing Serbia as a solution to ethno-national conflicts was both myopic and ill-conceived. Further reiterations of the inevitability of, and lack of alternatives to, independence for Kosovo constrained discussion over the possibility and nature of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/21/thereisanotherway\">other potential solutions</a>, including innovations in sovereignty and autonomy in line with UN security council <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/Kosovo/docu/u990610a.htm\">resolution 1244</a>.</p> <p>The new recognition game of international politics is unlikely to end here, with the aspirations of local ethnic majorities elsewhere fuelled by the Kosovo case. Secessionist movements within and beyond the EU's borders continue to insist that Kosovo is a model for their own respective causes. In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/17/afterkosovothedeluge\">former Soviet Union</a>, for instance, Armenian and Azerbaijani forces have clashed over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, whilst the Moldovan province of Trans-Dniester continues to seek recognition as an independent state. </p> <p>Kouchner's <a href=\"http://www.kosovocompromise.com/cms/item/analysis/en.html?view=story&amp;id=1203&amp;sectionId=2\">assertion</a> that \"when two communities cannot speak to each other, but they only speak through arms, there is no choice but to separate them\" is not only blind to Europe's very own history, principles and practices, but also to efforts to build peaceful co-existence throughout the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/26/serbia.georgia\">western Balkans</a>. The recognition of Kosovo's independence has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/19/theendofmultilateralism\">contributed</a> to the further erosion of two of the fundamental pillars of the international system \u2013 sovereign equality and the principle of the inviolability of borders. The resulting recognition games and \"parades of sovereignty\" will have a number of destabilising effects throughout the world. Only through a UN framework and respect for international law can progress be made towards a model of multilateral governance to contend with the challenges of the 21st century.</p>",

Filmgoers had waited a long, long time to see these two titans battle it out, and all they got was that startling scene in the coffee shop and the excellent finale at LAX airport.</p> <p>Now here comes Righteous Kill, another cop thriller, this time about two veteran New York City detectives (De Niro and Pacino) working to identify the possible connection between a recent murder and a case they believe they solved years ago. It arrives here on September 26 and <a href=\"http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=48261\">Coming Soon have just posted an exclusive clip</a> on their site showing the two actors on screen together.</p> <p>Both De Niro and Pacino are perhaps entering the twilight of their careers, at 65 and 68 respectively, which seems a funny sort of time for them to suddenly double up properly. Both also featured in Godfather II, of course, although they did not share any screen time.</p> <p>Righteous Kill is directed by Jon Avnet and also stars Donnie Wahlberg and Carla Gugino. Avnet also took charge of another Pacino thriller, 88 Minutes, which was panned upon its US release in April to such an extent that it hasn't yet been shown over here (an October 3 date has now been pencilled in). It currently has a <a href=\"http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/88_minutes/\">6% rating over on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which doesn't really bode well for Righteous Kill. Are you looking forward to seeing Pacino and De Niro buddy up? Or should this all have happened many years ago?</p>",
  "<p><br>Brad Pitt and George Clooney (with disenchanted festival-goer in the background). Photo: Reuters/Max Rossi</p> <p>Last night was all about the Coen brothers' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/27/venicefilmfestival.coenbrothers1\">Burn After Reading</a> - or more specifically, George'n'Brad, the buddy-buddy double act who briefly reunited for the film's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2008/aug/28/venicefilmfestival?picture=337029754\">red carpet premiere</a>. As your correspondent struggled into a suit to attend the event, he reflected on the way the city had temporarily become psychotically fixated on this grinning, perfectly-formed duo.</p> <p>After all the proles had been shoehorned inside the Palazzo cinema, closed-circuit cameras enabled us to not miss a moment of their <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/media/photo/2008-08/41865855.jpg\">adorable clowning and mugging</a> for the assembled crowds. In truth, it never fails to amaze me how comfortable some people are with knowing they are the centre of attention - and with movie stars its pretty much the major job description. </p> <p>On the other hand, most people don't have a camera trained on their face from the moment they sit down in a cinema seat, as Pitt did; nor do they then have to look at it 30 foot high as it is projected onto the cinema screen in front of them. Pitt actually bore that rather unpleasant intrusion with rather good humour - pretending to develop a twitch, wagging his finger at the cameraman, etc. Tilda Swinton, sitting next to him, looked definitely disturbed by the minuteness of the scrutiny - she's still got a lot to get used to in the Hollywood micro-climate. (Clooney, unsurprisingly, just came up with more doofus pranks: fingers held up behind the head, that sort of thing.)</p> <p>The opening rituals, hosted by Russian actor Ksenia Rappoport, were what I've come to understand is the traditional Venice shambles: names forgotten, nationalities got wrong, and celebrity guests not introduced. And rather shamefully for the locals, 99-year-old <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0210701/\">Manoel de Oliveira</a>, director of the opening short, was heckled by an audience member (presumably because he gave his speech in French). But after the interminable pre-show finished, the main feature went down well - and then several hundred people wandered down the road to a nearby hotel for a sit-down dinner in very fancy surroundings.</p> <p>Though your correspondent happily tagged along, little actual glamour attaches itself to these events: they are like going to a massive wedding where every one of your relatives has had plastic surgery. Since Frances McDormand's character in Burn After Reading is obsessed with finding money for her \"surgeries\", it was strangely appropriate.</p>",
  "<p>Three years after Hurricane Katrina, a more glamorous image of black America is presenting itself to the world in the person of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a>. Meanwhile, in New Orleans, America's story of black urban poverty is still unfolding, largely beneath the radar of the global media.</p> <p>In August and September 2005, areas like the largely black <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Ninth_Ward\">Lower Ninth ward</a>, almost entirely invisible to the hordes of tourists who flock to New Orleans every year, attracted worldwide sympathy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/hurricanekatrina.usa\">as the levees broke</a>. Now they have been all but forgotten. While tourists long ago repopulated the French Quarter, 57% of New Orleans' black population \u2013 against 36% of whites \u2013 have yet to return to the city. Many never will. This is because since Katrina, developers have clubbed together with the authorities to complete New Orleans' makeover into a playground for wealthy tourists.</p> <p>As house prices soar and homelessness rises, the authorities are quietly doing away with the city's remaining stocks of affordable housing in moves that the UN has recently claimed constitute human rights violations. The fact that these demolitions will overwhelmingly affect black people has led some to call this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/sep/24/usnews.hurricanes2005\">ethnic cleansing</a>.</p> <p>Looking back, these developments should come as no surprise. The sympathy that met Katrina's immediate aftermath was short-lived. In August 2005 it was poor African-American residents, statistically the least likely to have the means to evacuate the stricken city, who bore the brunt of the storm damage. Viewers all round the world watched in horrified fascination as conditions in the convention centre and Superbowl deteriorated. News reports did focus on the government's apparent abandonment of its own people, but a hysterical and arguably racist undercurrent was almost compulsively drawn to rumours of rape and murder \u2013 nearly all of which turned out to be untrue.</p> <p>As residents evacuated the city, and before the floodwaters had even receded, the future of New Orleans and its residents was being spoken about in no uncertain terms. \"We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans\", declared Republican congressman Richard Baker soon after the storm. \"We couldn't do it. But God did.\" Alphonso Jackson, the then US secretary of housing and urban development, made the racial implications of the gentrification process perfectly clear when he predicted that the reconstructed New Orleans would be a whiter city.</p> <p>In the three years since, race and class stereotypes have paved the way for New Orleans' so-called \"revitalisation\". \"We don't need soap opera-watchers right now\", claimed the city council president, Oliver Thomas \u2013 perpetuating the view that New Orleans' high unemployment rate can be tracked to individual laziness as opposed to the systemic discrimination affecting most of America's inner cities. At the same time, those same forces that demonise poor and particularly black families \u2013 for their apparent \"dysfunction\" \u2013 are actively preventing the regrouping of some of the most close-knit black communities in the US. </p> <p>The city is now in the process of phasing out the low-cost housing, public transportation system, and public health facilities that have supported the existence of low-income residents in New Orleans for decades. The US department of housing and urban development and the housing authority of New Orleans say that they wish to de-concentrate poverty in areas that were previously hotbeds for crime and drug abuse. Currently though, there are only plans to replace one-third of the units available for low-income renters. And as Audrey Stewart of the Loyola Law Clinic explains, the result is:</p> <blockquote> <p> ... thousands and thousands of homeless people camping out, under bridges, we have folks staying with relatives and friends \u2013 I see that all over my neighbourhood, five, six, seven, eight people living in these tiny houses. We have people getting kicked out of Fema [Federal Emergency Management Agency] trailers with nowhere to go.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many displaced New Orleans residents, black and white, are now calling for the \"right of return\" \u2013 and are in the process creating a dynamic grassroots movement that threatens to disrupt the relative calm that has eased the passage of the city's controversial reconstruction programme. This is just the kind of movement that Barack Obama spent the first part of his career organising for <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1177.html\">South Side</a> Chicago, and it may turn out that his ability as president to respond to this call proves decisive.</p> <p>Obama has been a vocal critic of the Bush administration's recovery and reconstruction programme, and his restoration plan for the region includes housing displaced residents who wish to return to the city. This time last year, Obama expressed concern that New Orleans would once again become the scene of the nation's broken promises, and told residents, \"I can promise you this: I will be a president who wakes up every morning and goes to bed every night with the future of this city on my mind.\" He said:</p> <blockquote> <p> ... racial discord, poverty, the old divisions of black and white, rich and poor, it's time to leave that to yesterday.</p> </blockquote> <p>But as the presidential campaign intensifies, Obama is increasingly under pressure to \"transcend race\". If this insidious demand should persist into an Obama presidency, it could seriously hinder a sustained focus on so racially charged an event as Katrina and its disastrous aftermath. What's certain is that the longer the world looks away, the more likely it is that a Disneyfied \"new\" New Orleans will mean the loss of a city that boasts one of the most complex cultural heritages in the world.</p> <p>Three years on from the storm, during an election year that has focused attention on a spectacular symbol of African American success, it seems that once again, no one is looking in the direction of a black America that has experienced only the rough end of the American dream.</p> <p><em>Anna Hartnell is lecturer in American literature &amp; culture at the University of Birmingham, <a href=\"mailto:a.hartnell@bham.ac.uk\">a.hartnell@bham.ac.uk</a></em></p>",
  "<p>New Orleans is on standby to evacuate as tropical storm Gustav heads towards the US, almost three years after the city was devastated by hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>Forecasters say Gustav will have become a powerful hurricane by the time it reaches the Gulf of Mexico and will probably hit the US coast on Monday, somewhere between Florida and Texas. Its most likely path will take it over New Orleans.</p> <p>Gustav killed 23 people as it crossed the Caribbean. It is heading for Jamaica, where the authorities have issued a hurricane warning, and is forecast to reach the US coast. </p> <p>This morning, the storm was 80 miles east of Jamaica and 170 miles south of Guantan\u00e1mo Bay in Cuba. Its top wind speeds were about 50mph \u2013 well below the 74mph that would make it a hurricane \u2013 but forecasters said Gustav was likely to build in strength as it passed over the deep warm water south of Cuba.</p> <p>Evacuations from New Orleans may start tomorrow. The oil company Shell has begun ferrying workers off its rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans on August 29 2005. It flooded 80% of the city and devastated smaller communities along the coast. More than 1,800 people died. </p> <p>Many residents defied evacuation orders to guard their homes and businesses from looters as law and order broke down. Others were unable to leave. They ended up waiting days for help, with no supplies and bodies floating in the floodwater.</p> <p>The Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, has declared a state of emergency, allowing him time to mobilise the national guard. \"Our state is better prepared than it has been before to respond to a major disaster,\" he said. \"But I want to emphasise that our citizens have a personal responsibility.\"</p> <p>Seven hundred buses are being prepared to evacuate 35,000 people suffering from medical conditions, and trains are on standby to move 7,000 elderly people to safety.</p> <p>City officials said the New Orleans mayor, Ray Nagin, who has cut short his trip to the Democratic national convention in Denver, would order an evacuation if Gustav looked likely to come ashore with wind speeds of more than 111mph. The order would be given 30 hours before the storm is likely to strike.</p> <p>Officials gave assurances that floodgates and pumping stations that failed catastrophically in 2005 would hold up.</p> <p>In the financial sector, there are fears that Gustav could damage to the oil platforms across the Gulf of Mexico that produce about a quarter of all US oil. Analysts are concerned that petrol supplies could be disrupted if refineries on the coast are damaged. The price of crude oil has risen for a fourth consecutive day, gaining more than one dollar to $119.25 (\u00a364) a barrel in early trading. </p> <p>Gustav has already wreaked havoc across the Caribbean. Up to 25 inches of torrential rain caused floods and mudslides that killed eight people in the Dominican Republic and 15 in Haiti. </p> <p>On the first anniversary of Katrina, the US president, George Bush, acknowledged that his government's response had been woefully inadequate. Many of the city's residents, especially black people and the poor, believe they were abandoned when the hurricane struck.</p>",
  "<p>After the tedious hours of marking exam papers comes the chance for lecturers to take revenge and expose their students' gaffes.</p> <p>Some of these so-called blunders made by undergraduates achieve an almost Joycean richness, suggesting a deeper truth \u2013 though probably not a better mark in the exam. Who, for instance, can resist the idea of \"escape goats\" or \"laxative enforcement policies\"?</p> <p>The Guardian \u2013 famous for our corrections column \u2013 is reticent about this sort of sneering at the young. But the Times Higher Education magazine has no inhibitions about inviting academics to submit entries to its Exam Howlers competition.</p> <p>Among the entries was a Bath Spa university student's answer to a question on the work of author Margaret Atwood. The unfortunate student wrote: \"The Handmaid's Tale shows how patriarchy treats women as escape goats.\"</p> <p>One professor from City University London was informed by one of his students that part of the reason for Northern Rock's downfall was \"the laxative enforcement policies\" of the regulator.</p> <p>One student, asked to outline the importance of the railway in 19th century Britain wrote: \"The railways were invented to bring the Irish from Dublin to Liverpool where they were promptly arrested for being vagrants.\"</p> <p>A fellow undergraduate, answering the same question, wrote: \"The railways were invented to take the weight off the motorways.\"</p> <p>Chris Holloway, a retired professor at the University of the West of England, sent the magazine a selection of his favourite exam howlers, including: \"Control of infectious diseases is very important in case an academic breaks out.\"</p> <p>Almost as wonderful is the news that \"the Loire valley inspired the chef to cook delicacies such as salmon, elves and lamprey\".</p> <p>Culled from exams and essays by students taking an environmental management honours course in Scotland are gems such as \"Conservation has a duel purpose\" and \"Greater numbers of predators suggest an increase in the morality of grouse\".</p> <p>The Confucian-like quality of \"sustainability is about not ruining life for our ancestors\" is perhaps something to meditate on as dusk settles over the grouse moor. It contrasts with the muscular evangelical statement that \"the Judo-Christian viewpoint is that man is the steward of the earth\".</p> <p>Conservation duels are being fought out in the Highlands - one student wrote about the threat of a \"vernacular railway\". But it is still an area with its unique form of entertainment. Red deer, we learn \"are native to Scotland and have long been cohabiting with man\". Moreover \"native woodland is good for the Caper Ceilidh\" \u2013 which suggests a bird renowned for its enthusiastic songs and drunken eightsome reels.</p> <p>The humorous efforts of <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/slbhill/humour_GCSEs.html\"> GCSE students</a> \u2013 most of whom sound rather bored - are another sub-genre.</p> <p>Example: Explain one of the processes by which water can be made safe to drink.<br>A: Flirtation makes water safe to drink because it removes large pollutants like grit, sand, dead sheep and canoeists.<br></p>",
  "<p>Gary McKinnon, a computer expert who hacked into dozens of US military computers, lost his appeal to the European court of human rights today and faces extradition to the US in the next fortnight, his solicitor said.</p> <p>McKinnon has fought a long battle with authorities over his extradition to the US, which has dubbed him the \"the world's most dangerous hacker\".</p> <p>McKinnon broke into the Pentagon's system from his north London flat and left a message saying \"your security is crap\".</p> <p>Last month, he lost his battle against extradition in a <a href=\" http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-1.htm\">House of Lords ruling</a>. </p> <p>McKinnon turned to the European court of human rights, complaining about the conditions he would face if convicted in the US and was granted a <a href=\" http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=mckinnon&amp;sessionid=13057322&amp;skin=hudoc-pr-en\">temporary delay</a>.</p> <p>The court did <a href=\" http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=1&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;action=html&amp;highlight=mckinn%20%7C%20on&amp;sessionid=13065686&amp;skin=hudoc-pr-en\">not give reasons for refusing</a> McKinnon's request today.</p> <p>Karen Todner, from Kaim Todner solicitors, said her client was \"distraught\" about the decision. She appealed to the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to intervene.</p> <p>\"Mr McKinnon has recently been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome. As a result, we will be writing to the home secretary again inviting a prosecution in this country,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot.</p> <p>\"Our client's case highlights a worrying trend where UK citizens are at the mercy of the ever-increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country.\"</p> <p>Using the codename Solo, the 42-year-old hacked into 53 US army computers and 26 US navy computers, including those at the US naval weapons station Earle in New Jersey, which is responsible for replenishing munitions and supplies for the Atlantic fleet.</p> <p>The US military said he left 300 computers unusable at a US navy weapons station immediately after 9/11. </p> <p>He was caught in 2002 as he tried to download a grainy black-and-white photograph he believed was an alien spacecraft from a Nasa computer at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas.</p> <p>He was easily traced by the authorities because he used his own email address.</p> <p>Mark Summers, an official representing the US government, said McKinnon's hacking was \"intentional and calculated to influence and affect the US government by intimidation and coercion\".</p> <p>American officials claim he caused $700,000 (\u00a3354,000) damage and threatened national security.</p> <p>If extradited, McKinnon faces up to 70 years in prison and his lawyers have argued he could even be given \"enemy combatant\" status, the same category applied to terrorist suspects interned at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>McKinnon, an unemployed IT worker from north London, has consistently argued that he was merely a \"bumbling computer nerd\" who caused no damage but was merely searching for evidence of extraterrestrial life. </p> <p>\"It got a bit silly,\" <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jul/09/weekend7.weekend2\">he told the Guardian</a> in 2005. \"I suppose it means I'm not a secretive, sophisticated, checking-myself-every-step-of-the-way type of hacker.\"</p> <p>Between 2001 and 2002 he scanned thousands of US government computers from his bedroom, looking for loopholes which would help him get inside their networks in order to prove his contention that the existence of aliens had been covered up by the CIA.</p> <p>After last month's House of Lords decision, McKinnon said the case had proved devastating in the six years since he was arrested. With his bail conditions barring him from using the internet, a return to his previous work in IT had been nearly impossible and potential employers were scared off.</p> <p>\"I've lost two jobs because of this; my bosses just didn't want to be associated with the publicity,\" he said.</p> <p>Todner denied McKinnon was a terrorist or a terrorist sympathiser and said his case could have been dealt with by our prosecuting authorities in Britain where the hacking raids were conducted. \"American officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry. The consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the European court to prevent his removal.\"</p> <p>McKinnon would face a much shorter sentence under Britain's computer crime laws. The defence has argued he is being unfairly targeted because his work embarrassed the US security services, and that an attempt by US prosecutors to make a deal with McKinnon - in which he would be offered a six-month sentence for his cooperation - constituted an unfair derailment of British legal procedures. That contention was rejected by the law lords, who said granting the appeal would \"imperil the integrity of the extradition process\".</p> <p>Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood said in the written judgment: \"The difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as the appellant's argument suggests.\"</p> <p>Computer security experts said it was unlikely US prosecutors would give up their pursuit. \"The US is making a clear stand that anyone making any attempts to compromise its computers and data will face the consequences,\" said Graham Cluley of the IT security company Sophos.</p> <p>McKinnon's extradition was brought under the controversial <a href=\" http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/operational-policing/extradition-act-2003\">Extradition Act 2003</a>, which was designed to deal with terrorist suspects but has been applied in cases where terrorism has not been the primary concern.</p> <p>Under the act, America authorities are able to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition_Act_2003\">demand a Briton's extradition without having to provide evidence</a>. However, Britain has to prove its case in a US court to extradite US citizens to the UK.</p> <p>The so-called Natwest Three were extradited under the same legislation in 2006 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/22/banking.enron\">this year sentenced to 37 months' imprisonment</a>.</p> <p>Among the act's critics is the former Tory MP Boris Johnson, now the London mayor, who in 2005 called for extradition of British citizens to the US <a href=\" http://p10.hostingprod.com/@spyblog.org.uk/freegary/2005/06/early-day-motion-241-on-the-extradition-act-2003.html \">to be suspended</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A self-taught gunsmith who ran an illegal arms factory converting replica submachine guns into lethal weapons was today sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 11 years.</p> <p>At least eight people, including a teenager, Michael Dosunmu, were killed by weapons converted by Grant Wilkinson in a shed in Berkshire.</p> <p>Dosunmu was shot by mistake as he slept in his bed in Peckham, south London. Another weapon was used during the robbery in which PC Sharon Beshenivsky was murdered three years ago in Bradford.</p> <p>Wilkinson, 34, of no fixed abode, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/28/2\">was convicted yesterday</a> at Reading crown court of buying replica MAC-10 submachine guns and converting them to fire. Police said his operation was one of the largest they had ever discovered. They believe it produced 90 guns used in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukguns\">a fifth of shootings in the capital</a> over two years.</p> <p>The judge, Zoe Smith, passing sentence, said: \"The scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country.</p> <p>\"The roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific. Some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for, and regrettably but doubtlessly, the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise.\"</p> <p>Detectives have offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information to help find the weapons still on the streets.</p> <p>Wilkinson, who grew up in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, was first arrested in his early teens for stealing a \u00a3100 pair of trainers from Lillywhites in London, and was in trouble with police regularly thereafter.</p> <p>\"Grant was expelled from Beaconsfield secondary school in the fourth year, probably age about 15, for persistent disruptive behaviour,\" a family friend said.</p> <p>\"He never went back to school after that. He worked subsequently on building sites as a labourer, but became involved in drug dealing, which was what his first prison term was for, as well as more thieving.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson's previous convictions date back to 1995, beginning with minor dishonesty, motoring and drugs matters.</p> <p>In 1996 he was jailed for four year for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. In 2002 he received another three years for possession of drugs with intent to supply.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replica guns claiming to be involved in making a James Bond film.</p> <p>His gun factory produced weapons and bullets linked to nine murder scenes. Wilkinson paid \u00a3500 each for the replica MAC-10s, which are made in the UK. After conversion they were sold for \u00a32,500, including ammunition. It is believed middlemen sold them on to criminal gangs.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas from <a href=\"http://www.sabredefence.com\">Sabre Defence Industries</a>, which had supplied previous Bond movie productions. Using the false name Wilson, he bought 90 guns and ammunition in batches and paid \u00a355,000 in cash.</p> <p>Guy Savage, a director of Sabre, became suspicious of Wilkinson, who he said was \"desperately disorganised\", and secretly took his photograph on his mobile phone. </p> <p>Wilkinson converted the submachine guns in two garden sheds behind a derelict property in Three Mile Cross, near Reading.</p> <p>One shed was used as a workshop and the other was soundproofed as a firing range for testing. Police were called in July 2007 after tenants in a nearby house accidentally came across the sheds.</p> <p>Officers discovered expensive industrial equipment used to smelt and cut metals. There were 27,700 spent cartridges at one shed and another site. The cartridges had been bought from gun clubs and could be reloaded.</p> <p>Dosunmu <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jun/18/ukguns.ukcrime\">was sprayed with bullets</a> from a MAC-10 after his killers mistook him for his older brother, whom they had intended to kill in a criminal feud.</p> <p>Wilkinson was convicted of a series of offences, including conspiracy to convert an imitation firearm, conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms and ammunition, possession of a firearm with intent to enable another person to endanger life, and possessing a prohibited firearm, namely a MAC-10. A second man, Garry Lewis, was cleared of all charges.</p> <p>Denis Burke, of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex case unit, said the racket \"met the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity. The firearms have since been used in all of our big cities, especially London\".</p> <p>Abdullah Al-Yunusi, Wilkinson's defence barrister, said in mitigation that his client was \"of low intelligence\", having not only supplied drugs in the past but used them.</p> <p>He said Wilkinson had no direct connection with the end users of the guns he manufactured and a complex supply chain had been involved.</p> <p>Police say even their own firearms officers have difficulty using a MAC-10 accurately.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Anthoney Wright (vocals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Anthoney Wright, who sang on the 2003 Basement Jaxx album Kish Kash, may have a quirkily spelled name but there's nothing very quirky about his music \u2013 he's one of the new unreconstructed Britsoul boys, one of the current male ripostes to the Amy/Duffy/Adele retro-soul hegemony, only way more trad and in hock to the original 60s and 70s American soul masters than David Jordan, Leon Jean Marie or Sam Sparro, who offer a comparatively modern, electronic take on R&amp;B. Even more than Bryn Christopher, his closest rival in the authentic soul-man stakes, whose album incorporates samples of old records, Wright applies his gritty rasp, all manly gospel fervour, to faithful recreations of those classic Stax and Motown rhythms by actual living, breathing contemporary session musicians. Is that Steve Cropper on guitar? Could be. Put it this way: if you had the radio on in the background and Wright's forthcoming single Reset to Zero came on \u2013 and, if you listen to Radio 2, this is not unlikely as it was a recent Record of the Week \u2013 you could be forgiven for assuming it was a cover of a Sam &amp; Dave or Temptations tune. Yes, it's that good. Pointless, perhaps (see also: Jamie Lidell), unoriginal certainly, but as expert facsimiles of a tried-and-tested sound go, it's unimpeachable.<br> We've been here before, of course, with Terence Trent D'Arby in the 80s and Don E and Sydney Youngblood in the 90s. Only now the time couldn't be more right \u2013 or Wright \u2013 with the nation going gaga for young men and women testifying over reproductions of Detroit and Memphis soul. Of course, that could be a problem for Wright even if he does have a hit with Reset to Zero: he might just be one nu-soul singer too many. What else does he have to offer beyond the inevitable Great Voice? Well, he's got the backstory of a penitent sinner, one worthy of Al Green himself. Having grown up in Nottingham with his Jamaican soul, calypso, ska and rock-playing radio DJ grandfather and strict Baptist grandmother, Wright moved to London where he proceeded to cane it with the best of them. But after one heavy weekend in 2004, he woke up and saw the light \u2013 he slept with his bedside lamp on \u2013 and realised his lifestyle was becoming increasingly shallow. \"There must be more to life than this,\" he said. \"I've had my fun. Now I want to spend the rest of my days wagging my finger and tutting at young people.\" That morning, as though by divine intervention, a friend telephoned and told him about The Monastery, a BBC TV show that was looking for five people to spend six weeks in Worth Abbey. Less than a week later, Wright walked into The Monastery and had a life-changing experience. Today, he's a Buddhist, still living in London but instead of profligacy and indulgence, his watchwords are discipline, reflection, accountability and life appreciation. What a bore. He even supports the Tibetan charity Rokpa. We're sure it's a great charity. We're just not sure what it's got to do with rock'n'roll.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"He's got the voice of an angel. A gruff-voiced angel, but an angel nonetheless.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's all a bit Stars in Their Eyes: \"Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to have someone from the audience pour hot grits on my back, after which I'm going to screech like a repentant zealot.\" <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Live in an Abbey.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Go out with Abi Titmuss.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Reset to Zero is released on September 22 by De Angelis. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Bryn Christopher, David Jordan, the Temptations, Marvin Gaye.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/anthoneywright\">www.myspace.com/anthoneywright<br> </a><br><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> All\u00e1.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>The fourth pot of today's Champions League draw contains some genuinely interesting names, unlike the other three which are full of the same old, same old.</strong> There are three clubs making their bow in the competition this season - Anorthosis of Cyprus, CFR Cluj of Romania, and the magnificently monickered Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical of Borisov in Belarus. Meanwhile Atletico Madrid had not made the Champions League since 1997, but did so this time after last night's shellacking of fancied Germans Schalke. Their dream draw might be Liverpool, for Fernando Torres-related reasons among other perhaps more cynical ones. Meanwhile for other romantic old-boy match-up action, BATE Borisov really should be paired up with Barcelona, for whom their academy find Alexander Hleb now plays. It is on.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Going Not Very Far Out On A Limb dept.</strong> Manchester United are going to get a very easy draw indeed. You know it, I know it, we all know it.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>THE POTS ARE LIKE THIS...</strong><br><strong>POT ONE:</strong> Chelsea, Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Manchester United, Lyon, Jose Mourinho's Internazionale (to give them their full official name), Real Madrid.<br><strong>POT TWO:</strong> Bayern Munich, PSV Eindhoven, Villareal, Roma, Porto, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon, Juventus.<br><strong>POT THREE:</strong> Marseille, Zenit St Petersburg, Steaua Bucharest, Panathinaikos, Bordeaux, Celtic, Basel, Fenerbahce.<br><strong>POT FOUR:</strong> Shakhtar Donetsk, Fiorentina, Atletico Madrid, Dynamo Kiev, CFR Cluj, AaB Aalborg, Anorthosis, Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>...AND THE RULES ARE LIKE THIS</strong><br>I really don't think it's worth bothering with the details. Suffice to say it's all skewed in favour of the big boys, down to the rule which ensures Manchester United and Liverpool can't play on the same night for television purposes. The wonder of sport, right here.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Doing Down The English, It's What The English Do Best dept.</strong> \"Did you know that Robert Pires in his last-and-slightly-knackered season at Arsenal managed to score more league goals than Hleb did in his entire Arsenal career?\" asks Paul McElroy, who is presumably a fan of the aforementioned Gunners, for he continues thus: \"Not that I'm bitter. Expect Arsenal to get one Dutch side they should cruise past...but don't.\" Meanwhile a final nod to the dismal rubbish Liverpool foisted on the nation last night, because this is beginning to kick folk when they're down and this report is all about spreading the love. \"Is everyone praying to get Liverpool?\" asks Dave Douglas. \"After yesterday's debacle, the likes of Anorthosis, CFR Cluj and Borisov must be hoping and praying they get the golden ticket.\" Seeing Liverpool have actually lost a qualifier in a previous season yet still gone on to win the entire competition, you could possibly be jumping the gun on that one.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>The draw begins, by the way, at 5pm.</strong> \"I was at the Basel v Guimaraes game last night and the home fans felt it was a special event,\" says Mark Bennett. Don't worry, there is a healthy dose of cynicism coming up. \"It was great to see a team's fans really enjoy their moment, and the chance to see Barcelona/Bayern or whoever. I remember ( I think) when Europe was special to me, as an Arsenal fan, when these games were unique and unusual. Now they are humdrum and routine (except the odd San Siro trip). Just hope I can get tickets for Basel v Big Guns.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Ray Wilkins, on Sky Sports News, keeps referring to Internazionale and their \"M Factor\".</strong> \"They've got a very good manager. They have what I like to call the M Factor.\" Stop it. Please stop talking about Internazionale's M Factor.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>And it's over to the draw, live from the Grimaldi Something-or-other in Monaco!</strong> Cue pompous caterwauling and tedious montages of players shouting in an aggressive fashion - where is the love, Frank? Then Melanie Winiger and Pedro Pinto, whoever these toasters are, bound onto the stage and start shouting at everyone. By all accounts, according to Pedro, last year's Champions League was \"one of the most memorable in the history of the competition\". Was it, though? Was it really? In 53 years of European competition? Manchester United fans may have enjoyed it, granted, but who's going to remember that final in a few years ti... ah hold on, there's John Terry slipping over. Yeah, it <em>was</em> a minor classic now I come to think about it.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Pedro isn't letting Melanie get a word in edgeways!</strong> What a rude pig! He's handing out some tinpot awards at the moment. Club Goalkeeper Of The Year... is Petr Cech. \"During the penalty shootout what was going through your mind?\" asks Pedro. Cech replies: \"STOP WASTING MY TIME, STOP WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME. GET ON WITH THE DRAW OR I AM GOING TO KILL YOU, PEDRO, I AM GOING TO KILL YOUUUUUUUUU.\" He doesn't actually say that, babbling on about how difficult it is to play in a pressure blah platitude and so on, but you can tell something is going on behind Cech's slowly narrowing eyes.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Andrew Darbyshire picks me up for being slack:</strong> \"Come on Scott. You're six paragraphs in and still no mention of Uefa bigwigs tucking into copious amounts of buffet food.\" Oh. Sorry. Some of them are quite fat, I can tell you that for nothing. One of them has stopped sucking on his foie-gras-and-butter shake to start banging on about the rules. I simply refuse to listen to him; I know you'll understand.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>After 15 minutes of buggering around, they've finally started to make the draw.</strong> The first club out of the pot is Chelsea, who will be in... hold on, some goon is taking about ten years to open the ball and unfold the piece of paper within... Group A. Inter are next out, and they're in Group B. This is all a bit sequential. I don't trust this draw. I don't trust anyone. Where has my love gone?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17.17pm:</strong> Lyon are in Group Eff. My trust in this draw, and in love, is restored.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17.20pm:</strong> Arsenal are in Group G. Oh this is futile. Right, I'm drawing up a lovely grid which I'm going to spend the next few minutes filling in. I didn't think this through. Real Madrid are in Group H.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>THE GROUPS (first pot)</strong></p> <p>A: CHELSEA<br>B: Internazionale<br>C: Barcelona<br>D: LIVERPOOL<br>E (for Easiest): MANCHESTER UNITED <br>F: Lyon<br>G: ARSENAL<br>H: Real Madrid</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>They're now holding the Club Defender of the Year award.</strong> They're wasting my time, I tells ya. John Terry wins it! Hahahahahahahahaha. Oddly, when he comes up to collect the award, Ricardo Carvalho isn't right by his side holding his hand and guiding him through it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Another montage, more ear-bleeding music. I'm getting old.</strong> Derrick Cameron has a question or two re BATE Borisov. \"Why aren't they just called Tractor Borisov, in the manner of Torpedo Moscow, Rotor Volgograd and Helicopter Gunship Tblisi (okay, I made that last one up)? And when will they ever get to play the Tractor Boys of Ipswich?\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>THE GROUPS (second pot)</strong></p> <p>A: CHELSEA, Roma<br>B: Internazionale, Werder Bremen<br>C: Barcelona, Sporting Lisbon<br>D: LIVERPOOL, PSV Eindhoven<br>E (for Easiest): MANCHESTER UNITED, Villarreal<br>F: Lyon, Bayern Munich<br>G: ARSENAL, Porto<br>H: Real Madrid, Juventus</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Gag of the day, right here:</strong> \"Tractor Borisov? It sounds like a Soviet-approved children's story,\" quips Paul McElroy. Meanwhile this is who Pedro Pinto is; thanks to Peter Walker, because I couldn't be bothered to find out. \"He's a bafflingly popular CNN sports anchor. He is - I believe - Portuguese and demonstrates this by saying the names of Spanish and Portuguese players in an exaggerated Iberian accent when presenting on CNN. He has never been known to have a hair out of place.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>The Uefa-sponsored satire continues apace:</strong> First John Terry, now Frank Lampard wins Club Midfielder of the Ye... no, I can't bring myself to finish that.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>THE GROUPS (third pot)</strong></p> <p>A: CHELSEA, Roma, Bordeaux<br>B: Internazionale, Werder Bremen, Panathinaikos<br>C: Barcelona, Sporting Lisbon, Basel<br>D: LIVERPOOL, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille<br>E (for Easiest): MANCHESTER UNITED, Villarreal, CELTIC<br>F: Lyon, Bayern Munich, Steaua Bucharest<br>G: ARSENAL, Porto, Fenerbahce<br>H: Real Madrid, Juventus, Zenit St Petersburg</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>It's time for European Club Forward Of The This Means Nothing.</strong> And of course the winner is Cristiano Ronaldo. At least Uefa aren't persisting with the ludicrous line that Ronaldo scored 42 goals last season from midfield, tucked away on the wing. He floated about all over the shop up front, as far as I could make out.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>THE GROUPS (final pot; this is the way it is)</strong></p> <p>A: CHELSEA, Roma, Bordeaux, Cluj.<br>B: Internazionale, Werder Bremen, Panathinaikos, Anorthosis.<br>C: Barcelona, Sporting Lisbon, Basel, Shakhtar Donetsk.<br>D: LIVERPOOL, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille, Atletico Madrid. <br>E (for Easiest): MANCHESTER UNITED, Villarreal, CELTIC, Aalborg.<br>F: Lyon, Bayern Munich, Steaua Bucharest, Fiorentina.<br>G: ARSENAL, Porto, Fenerbahce, Dynamo Kiev.<br>H: Real Madrid, Juventus, Zenit St Petersburg, Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Well, that's a hell of a draw for Liverpool.</strong> You would fancy Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United to make it through their groups, though. And I'd say Celtic have a fair chance of progress, given they've beaten Manchester United at Parkhead recently, plus given Barcelona a good old rattle. The Torres matches will be great, though, and it's fantastic to see Borisov Automobile and Tractor Electrical Equipment playing against the grandest European Cup club of all in Real Madrid.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Afternoon. Well this is all rather odd isn't it? No, not Man City facing the ignominy of defeat at the hands of a football team beginning with the letter 'M' that they were easily expected to beat (their 1-2 defeat to Mansfield in the first round (north) of the Auto Windscreens Shield in 1998/99 took that plaudit). But a 3.25pm kick-off? Denmark's not moved to India has it? And there was I looking forward to another belting early afternoon courtroom drama from Five like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117123/\">My Son Is Innocent</a>. </p> <p><strong>BREAKING NEWS, BREAKING NEWS, BREAKING NEWS</strong></p> <p>Shaun Wright Phillips has re-signed for Manchester City. \"Obviously I'm delighted to come back to City and I just can't wait to get started again,\" said the pint-sized winger. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/28/manchestercity.chelsea\">Read the full story here</a>. </p> <p><strong>As for this afternoon's match,</strong> Micah Richards has recovered from the concussion he suffered against West Ham and should be available to bolster City's defence. </p> <p>And in attack, Jo is back in contention after returning from Brazil's failed bid for Olympic gold in Beijing.</p> <p>Mark Hughes had this to say about City's mission at the SAS Arena in Herning. \"I have not been in this position that many times, and it's not one I like being in. We have made it difficult for ourselves because of the result, and the performance, in the first leg. But we have nothing to lose, we have to be positive and go for the win.\" Hmmm. Interesting. </p> <p><strong>My prediction:</strong> FC Midtjylland 1-1 Man City.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Pre-match emails:</strong> \"WTF's going on?\" asks Andy in Taunton. Dunno Andy, I was just about to make a cup of tea. \"One minute we're buying 20m Brazillian reserves then we're skint. Then it's Corluka who's off/staying, then Kompany (who looked good on MOTD Saturday[did he?]) and now possibly we're back in for Sweep and Fatoldo. I hope I'm wrong but can't help wondering if SWP's off the boil because of Chelski or in spite of them\u2026 Still even if he isn't the same, it's good business if the price is \u00a39m (\u00a315m profit).\" That's almost better business than when I sold three Black Jacks and a sherbert liquorice bar to a kid at school for 21 pence over the odds.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>\"Is this a joke? Where's the mid-afternoon rom-com,\" asks Emma in Sheffield. \"It's my day off and I get this instead.\" Sorry Emma, but if you're not bothering to watch the match what are you doing emailing me? Are you stalking me? Is this your way of getting around that restraining order?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The teams are in:</strong></p> <p><strong>FC Midtjylland:</strong> Heinze, Afriyie, Califf, Reid, Poulsen,<br>Florescu, Salami, Olsen, Borring, Thygesen, Nworuh. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Raska, Madsen, Kim Christensen, Ipsa, Frank Kristensen, Flinta, Babantude.<br><strong>Man City:</strong> Hart, Ben-Haim, Richards, Dunne, Michael Ball,<br>Corluka, Johnson, Ireland, Petrov, Elano, Jo.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Robert Malek (Poland)<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Schmeichel, Garrido, Gelson, Caicedo, Hamann, Evans, Sturridge.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>So in an attempt to inject a bit of life into the City attack Hughes has taken a punt on Jo with Elano just behind.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're underway at the SAS Arena. Micah Richards looks to be playing at centre midfield. In the first leg City were harassed in the centre of the park so Richards' energy will combat this. There's a cracking atmosphere in Denmark despite the early kick-off. Can anyone explain why it has kicked off at this time?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> City make a bright start with a pacy break down the left from Petrov. His cross is too high for Stephen Ireland to reach, but it is a promising start for Mark Hughes' men.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Nworuh breaks for Midtjylland but Richard Dunne charges into him and wins the ball with a rough house challenge. Ireland goes close with a shot from 20 yards at the other end. It's quite a bright start from both sides.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Stephen Ireland is being referred to as Simon Ireland on Five. You can always count on the home of Neighbours for accuracy. Borring is sent clear after a slide-rule ball from the midfield but he doesn't connect properly with his shot and Hart saves well low down to his left.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> \"The reason for this match being the early kick-off is that Danish giants Br\u00f8ndby(!) are the main attraction tonight as they take on Finnish side Haka - with the same TV station having the broadcasting rights,\" says Henning Andersen. \"Nevermind that they (Br\u00f8ndby) take a four-goal lead into the second leg! By the way; the first leg wasn't even shown on Danish TV! Not live anyways.\" Cheers Henning. Petrov, who has looked like City's most dangerous player so far, breaks down the left again. His cross bounces to the back post but Jo just can't get his studs to it.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> The match has settled down after an energetic start. It's teeming down with rain in Denmark and many of the players are struggling to control the ball. Micah Richards passes the ball out of play. There wasn't a player within 10 yards of where he knocked that. He shakes his head in disgust with himself.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Jo is sent to the deck after a spiky challenge from a Midtjylland defender whose name escapes me. It was a fair old challenge though. The Danes look pretty comfortable in possession now. A sharp series of passes out of defence result in a foul on Nworuh 40 yards from goal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Jo doesn't look up for any kind of physical battle. He takes the ball on his chest but is easily out-muscled by Califf who gathers possession and allows Midtjylland to build another attack.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> \"Just a thought,\" ponders Colin Greer. \"How do Stephen Ireland's hair plugs look today? Perhaps he could ask Tal Ben-Haim (aka the Human Eyebrow) to supply follicles for his next transplant.\" He's got a full-on bonehead today Colin so I presume for the first time in his life he has accepted the truth.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> City are working their way back into the match and moving forward more as a unit. They'll have to be wary of being caught on the break though, as Midtjylland have pace in abundance from midfield going forward. Borring hits a fizzing volley from 25 yards on the left side of the 18-yard box, but Hart plucks it from the air.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Elano jinks his way between two defenders and cleverly wins a free-kick on the left corner of the 18-yard box. The Brazilian gets himself to his feet and curls the free-kick over rather wastefully.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> City are immediately stretched as Midtjylland break on the left wing. The ball is dragged back to Thygesen in the six-yard box, but Michael Ball makes a wonderful last-ditch tackle to save City from conceding a certain goal. Midtjylland win a corner...</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong>...which is swung in but cleared easily by the City defence.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Midtjylland are working the ball out of defence with a comfort that many so-called Premier League Big Boys could only hope to aspire to. They're a little lightweight up front, but they've been the better side so far.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> \"What is the strange obsession with Brazilians that someone at Man City has got?\" asks Michael Hunt. \"Elano and Jo up front now, offers for Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Nene. Is this desperation for a showcase signing working purely on the principle that a Brazilian striker is pretty exciting? It's a theory I've fallen foul of several times before in Championship Manager to be fair.\" The most exciting thing Jo has done so far today has tied his shoe-laces. City need to work the ball out to their wide men if they're to bypass the congested and busy Midtjylland midfielders.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Danny Califf gets a painful shave as Elano's studs scrape his chin in a disastrous effort from the Brazilian to try an overhead kick from 40 yards out. Mark Hughes has a face like thunder in the dugout.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> In the absence of any kind of action other than midfield rumbustiousness, this from Adrian Cooper: \"Is it possible that, far from accepting the truth, Stephen Ireland is instead wearing a skull cap to hide the hair transplant in an attempt to ward off the ridicule of his team mates, in particular the overly-hirsute Benjani?\" Hmmm. It wouldn't surprise me. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/sep/15/newsstory.sport4\">He is one for telling a tale...</a> Action at last. Well, a bit of action. Olsen rampages down the right wing and plays a ball across the six-yard box, but it evades everybody.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Richards wins the ball 30 yards from goal. He flicks the ball to Elano, who backheels the ball to Johnson. He in turn finds Petrov on the left corner of the 18-yard box, who rifles a volley straight into the arms of Heinze who does very well in the skiddy conditions not to spill the ball at Jo's feet. That was City's best move of the match. And the last of the first half. Emails to follow...</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>HAlf-time emails:</strong> \"Was Jo at the back of the queue (admittedly ahead of Fred) when they were doling out fancy names to Brazilian footballers? And where was he when they dished out the talent?\" asks Mark Jones. Judging by his performance so far Mark, I reckon he wasn't even in the queue.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>\"Sat at work watching words isn't quite the same,\" says Tom in Manchester who I presume is a numbers man. \"But nevertheless, I believe we should have kept 'The Kid Sturridge' up front and gone with an older head such as Hamann in the middle. His passing can break up many a strong midfield.\" I'm not sure I'd agree Hamann is a dynamic midfielder, but he never gives the ball away and would bring a calmness to City's frantic passing. I've got some worrying news for you too Mark. Stan Collymore agrees with your two substitutions. Do you think and act like Stan in all things you do? Just might swerve Manchester next time I'm north, that's all.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>\"I can't work out which is more painful, the insipid display from The Double Conquerers of the Champions of the Best League in the Wooooooooorld (TM) or the God awful commentary from Five. Seeing as Five is the home of Neighbours any chance they can draft in a Lou Carpenter and Mrs Mangle for a commentary dream team for the second half?' ho-hums John Allen. They're both dead aren't they John? Silence throughout the second-half. That'd be great.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Second-half delay:</strong> Apparently some eagle-eyed jobsworth linesman has noticed a hole in one of the nets, so they're waiting on a spinster to come and sew it up. Meanwhile if you want to flick over to check the Big Cup draw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/28/championsleague\">Scott Murray's on the case.</a></p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> The net is fixed and away we go. Petrov immediately slices a shot wide from an impossible angle on the left of the 18-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> City win a corner, which Stephen Ireland swings in. Richards towers above the defence and directs a powerful header towards the right hand corner. The header is cleared to Petrov who drives a stinging shot into the outstretched groin of Salami - who doesn't flinch. NOT EVEN A BIT! I'll avoid meat jokes. </p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> \"It's Tom that agrees with Collymore, not me,\" says an outraged Mark Jones. \"I haven't agreed with him since he once scored the winner for Liverpool at the Baseball Ground and celebrated by humping Paul Ince's leg. Should have seen it coming really.\" Sorry Mark. Consider myself admonished. Elano is booked for getting moody and pushing Salami after he was tripped by the big Midtjylland defender.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Florescu drives a Hollywood style diagonal ball to Olsen on the right. He chases the ball down but looks too knackered to do anything with it when he gets there. He buys a throw off Michael Ball though. But Midtjylland look happy to take the ball backwards and keep possession. City need to take the game to the Danes to stay in the competition.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Borring drives through midfield and takes a punt from 30 yards. His shot is deflected wide for a corner, which is deflected out for another corner. Borring is a powerhouse in midfield.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Mark Hughes clearly thinks and acts like Stan Collymore too, so there's another reason to avoid Manchester. Sturridge is on for Elano. Hamann is on for Ben Haim. That's an attack-minded substitution. Sturridge will play much further forward than Elano.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Florescu plays another raking ball out to Olsen on the left. He makes a yard for himself and drives a dangerous ball across the penalty box, but Richards (who has slipped back into the centre of defence) clears the threat.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> In reference to my previous 'buys a throw off Michael Ball' comment. \"How much do throws off Michael Ball cost?\" asks Alex Walsh. \"Do they feature balloons?\" No Alex, I believe they come with a free whistle.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Sturridge injects a little of the missing cut and thrust into City's attack by skipping free of his marker and angling a shot at goal from 20 yards. His pot shot doesn't have the va-va-voom to worry Heinze in goal though.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Joe Hart does brilliantly to avoid getting sent off. Thygesen was sent through after a neat lofted ball from Borring, he flicked the ball at Hart, who was out of his area, but the keeper used his midriff instead of his arms to deflect his shot.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Nworuh has been replaced by Baba Collins in the Midtjylland attack.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Richard Dunne concedes a corner on the right hand side after a fast break from the fresh-legged Baba Collins. The corner is floated in by Borring and Baba Collins goes an inch wide of the left post with a cushioned header. That was a let off.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Jo is having a stinker. He's all arms and legs as the ball arrives at his feet from midfield. And again he is dispossessed. Petrov has been quiet since his shot early in this half. He needs to get involved, as he's the only one with the nous to work a shooting opportunity, given the evidence this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> City can't get hold of the ball and keep it. Micah Richards is booked for dissent. On the subject of another City booking Gavin Hutchinson has this to say about my comment on 50 mins. \"'Elano is booked for getting moody and pushing Salami.' Is that a euphemism?\" he asks. No but having read that back I think it sounds like he deserves a red card and perhaps I should consider working at Nuts.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Borring plays two excellent balls through to Baba Collins. The first is snuffed out by Richards. But the second is perfectly weighted after a rangy run down the left. This time the ball lands at Baba Collins' feet 10 yards from goal but the substitute shows why he didn't start by hopelessly lashing his shot wide. Borring has been immense.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Stephen Ireland is still being called Simon Ireland by Kevin Gallacher. Perhaps Ireland's changed his name to hide the truth further. Borring again rampages down the left and finds Baba Collins unmarked in the six-yard box with a pin-point cross, but he manages to use his knee to deflect it over. City are abject. They have no creativity.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Evans finally puts Jo out of his misery by replacing him. The youngster has an immediate strike on goal from 18 yards but the shot has no power and dribbles wide.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> \"Afternoon, Gregg,\" chirps Ian Copestake. \"I just want to forewarn you that future comparisons of emailers with Collymore may result in libel actions after watching him pleasure Sharon Stone to death in the opening of Basic Instinct II.\" Hmmm. Perhaps I should send that update through to the legal dept. Meanwhile on the pitch, Kristensen replaces Olsen. If anything Midtjylland look like the team chasing the game as they pile forward.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Goal!!! Midtjylland 0-1 Man City, 89 min:</strong> Danny Califf heads into his own net after the first decent cross of the match from Manchester City on the left wing by Michael Ball. This is heading into extra-time.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> That goal came from nowhere. Evans races forward as City hope to steal the tie. But the youngster drives from an impossible distance from goal and his shot is saved.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Well, that was a smash-and-grab job from City. They scarcely deserved the goal, but if anything, they'll be the team with the greater spirit as the match enters extra-time. Don't leave work yet folks.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> City get extra-time off to a bright start with a period of slick passing around the Danish side's penalty box. Corluka picks the ball up on the right and clips a little ball in towards Sturridge, but Heinze punches clear.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> The small band of travelling City fans can be heard clearly above the incessant drumming of the Danes in the stands now. They seem to be singing something to the tune of 'The Flower of Scotland'. As a fan of Celtic songs I've got to say it sounds good. City pour forward again, this time on the right flank, but Ireland mis-reads the run of Sturridge and gives away possession.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+5 min:</strong> Ireland plays a beautiful slide-rule pass to Michael Johnson, who is clean through 20 yards from goal. Heinze rushes out at the youngster, who gets too square and can't steer the ball around the keeper. The ball then breaks to Petrov on the left. He swings a cross in towards Ireland, who two yards out, somehow lets the ball skid off his shiny bald top and out wide for a goal-kick. If he'd have kept his hair-transplant, he'd have scored.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90+8 min:</strong> City are well on top in extra-time. They look fresher than at the start of the match.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+9 min:</strong> The rain is lashing down in Denmark, which makes Joe Hart's collection of a low fizzed-in cross from Poulsen all the more impressive. Salami squeels a bit as he hobbles over to the touchline to have treatment for cramp.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+11 min:</strong> Sturridge rattles the crossbar after nonchalantly controlling the ball on the right corner of the 18-yard box and cracking a shot at goal with his left foot. That was might unlucky from the youngster, who has done a hell of a lot more than Jo did in his time on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90+13 min:</strong> The Danes have slowed the pace of the game down. Probably due to fatigue I guess.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Extra-time - half-time:</strong> \"Sorry to be a statto,\" says William Hoyle. \"I imagine Kevin Gallacher is getting his Irelands mixed up as Blackburn had a Simon Ireland on their books when Gallacher was at Rovers!\" Well done statto. That's exactly what he said when he'd taken his medication and returned to 2008.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+15 min:</strong> City are shooting from right to left on my little telly box as they make a last ditch attempt to snatch this tie.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90+18 min:</strong> Florescu hits a piledriver from 30 yards after City fail to clear effectively. The ball arrows towards goal just an inch off the surface and Hart does brilliantly to gather it into his chest at the first attempt. A cross from Borring (my man-of-the match, I might add) is then swung towards Hart from the left but just lands above the crossbar, much to the out-of-positioned Hart's relief.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90+20 min:</strong> Petrov tries to skip around Afriyie, but he is well marshaled and City have to settle for a throw. Hamann has steadied things for City in the midfield, where they are now the dominant force.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90+22 min:</strong> Midtjylland clear with a weak header and Johnson lashes a volley from 25 yards towards the bottom left hand corner of the goal. Heinze looks worried as he scrambles over to cover it, but the ball bounces a foot wide. Salami then sends Johnson tumbling to the ground, but the referee is correct to adjudge that there's no penalty.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90+24 min:</strong> The game appears to be drifting towards penalties now as tiredness dictates that it is played at walking pace. Kevin Gallacher says this of Richard Dunne: \"People see his weight and his lack of pace and think he's not a good defender. But deep beneath he's a good, fast defender.\" I'm sure inside Rick Waller there was skinny pop-star waiting to get out.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90+26 min:</strong> Joe Hart pulls off another wonderful save after a scrambled shot from somebody in a red shirt within a huddle of players. Sorry I can't be more specific.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90+29 min:</strong> City win a corner and the ball breaks to Hamann. But the lanky German's volley is lashed over. Get ready for penalties, this one is over.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>Get ready to bite your fingernails City fans. Penalties to follow...</strong></p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p>The only time I've seen City perform well in a penalty shoot-out was when they got promoted from League One many blue moons ago. They have a German in their team with penalty shootout nous in Hamann though. Here we go...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>Ched Evans scores the first penalty for City. High into the top right corner. <strong>City 1-0 Midtjylannd</strong></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p>Reid hits it straight down the centre to score for the Danes. A great penalty. <strong>City 1-1 Midtjylland</strong>.</p> <p>Petrov scores low to the left. <strong>2-1 to City</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>Poulsen doesn't even takes a step as he drives his penalty into the top left hand corner. That was cool. <strong>City 2-2 Midtjylland</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p>Youngster Michael Johnson hits a weak penalty low to the left which Heinze saves. <strong>City 2-2 Midtjylland</strong></p> <p>Joe Hart makes a wonderful save to his right from the man-of-the-match Borring. <strong>City 2-2 Midtjylland</strong></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p>Hamann steps up for City...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>...and does a trademark dummy and sweeps it into the top right corner as if he does it for fun. You gotta' love those Germans. My mum's one. <strong>City 3-2 Midtjylland</strong></p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p>Afriyie steps up and blasts the ball straight at Joe Hart. <strong>City 3-2 Midtjylland</strong></p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p>Corluka can win this for City...</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>...the Croatian strokes it to the right of the goal sending Heinze the wrong way and City have got through this tie by the skin of their teeth. <strong>City 4-2 Midtjylland</strong></p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>Post-match musings:</strong> City didn't play for 89 minutes this afternoon. Just like Liverpool last night, the tie was salvaged by one decent cross from the left hand-side. Midtjylland will be crestfallen, as they had countless opportunities to progress, but thanks to Baba Collins' profligacy and Joe Hart's brilliance they are out and City are through. Thanks for all your emails. I think Neighbours is on now if you want me to stick around to do a live commentary of that? On second thoughts...</p>",
  "<p>When I meet Moses Eriebu, head of police for Katine sub-county, the latest criminal case on his table involves a 30-year-old woman who was badly beaten by a man.</p> <p>According to a statement recorded in red ink, the woman says that the man hit her on the head with a beer bottle so hard, that the bottle broke. The blow could have killed her.</p> <p>The incident involved Lucy, a housewife from Abari village in the Katine parish of Ochuloi, and Moses, Lucy's husband and father of her six children. Lucy and Moses have now become another statistic in Katine's criminal justice system.</p> <p>Despite having just three fully-trained officers in Katine, the police still play a pivotal role in the justice system here. If cases are reported, police work will determine whether they get to court. </p> <p>But the police are not the first port of call if a crime is committed; cases are normally first reported to the Local Council (LCI) chairperson, the elected village leader who may try to resolve the matter or refer it to the police.</p> <p>This is what happened in Lucy's case. She says that on the evening of August 15, she asked her husband for money to buy food for dinner. About 1,000 Ugandan shillings ($0.6) would have sufficed but Moses, a tailor, said he had no money. With that he went off to drink ajon with the men, only to return around 10pm to demand his dinner \u2013 which his penniless wife did not have.</p> <p>This infuriated Moses, who began kicking Lucy. She fled to the home of the LCI chairman, Moses Epaku, which is where the most horrifying thing happened.</p> <p>\"She came here at night to report that her husband was beating her,\" recalls Epaku, sitting on a foldable wooden stool under a tree in his compound. \"We were right under this tree when her husband followed her here and hit her right in front of me. He hit her on the head with a beer bottle, which broke into pieces.\"</p> <p>The aggressor was restrained and the couple later returned home. The following day, Epaku referred Lucy to the Katine Police Post with a letter stating the basic facts of the case.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337030585\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/08/28/Katine-police-chairman.jpg\" alt=\"Katine police chairman\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LCI chairman Moses Epaku. Photograph: Richard M Kavuma</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard M Kavuma/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"She was not feeling very well. I gave her the letter so that the police would give her a form to go for a medical check up,\" Epaku explains. \"After that, the police will give her a letter to come back here and solve the matter \u2013 or she and her husband can sort the matter out at the police station.\"</p> <p>In this village, like elsewhere in Katine, the most common reported cases of crime are domestic violence or, as Epaku and officer Eriebu put it, cases of men beating their wives. Occasionally thefts of goats, chickens or cattle are reported, but out of 33 cases recorded at Katine last month, 14 or 42% were assault cases, followed by theft (20%) and defilement (9%).</p> <p>When a crime is reported chairman Epaku usually calls a meeting of his nine-member LCI executive committee, which constitutes itself into a court to hear the complainant and the accused.</p> <p>The village court may dish out punishments such as fines or ordering an abusive party to pay for the treatment of the victim. But if the two parties can't reach a compromise, the chairman refers the matter to the police. Besides the main police post at Katine, the sub-county has one other small outstation at Olwelai, which has one fully trained officer and a few constables.</p> <p>\"But there are some cases which LC courts can't hear; capital offences such as murder, defilement, and robbery assault where a victim bleeds a lot \u2013 these we refer to the police right away,\" Epaku says.</p> <p>If cases (particularly of violence or land conflicts) are not reported to LCs, they may end up at the door of the clan leader, who will convene a clan court to listen to the case and decide the outcome. Despite losing some of their powers to LCs, clans remain fairly powerful and clan leaders greatly respected, especially in rural areas such as Katine.</p> <p>\"The clan court can give punishments; they can even order that a guilty person be given several strokes of the cane,\" says Epaku, although he could not recall an example where that had happened recently.</p> <p>According to Charles Emaju, a member of the sub-county council and one of Lucy's neighbours, crime in Katine has reduced largely due to the good work of both the LCs and the police. If a case is reported, 30-year-old Emaju says, the leaders make sure it is fully resolved.</p> <p>\"But at one time the police were beginning to do work meant for LCs, for instance by coming into the community to follow-up cases of domestic quarrels; we warned them about this in the council and we are now very happy with their work,\" says Emaju. This is interesting because government officials have previously warned LCs that they should not handle cases such as defilement, because they are supposed to be police cases.</p> <p>Eriebu agrees that crime is down in Katine \u2013 except for \"domestic quarrels\". Upon receiving a case like Lucy's, a police detective will take a statement from the complainant, who is given a form to get checked by a medical officer. Once the form is returned, police will investigate and if the Resident State Attorney, based 22 kilometres away in Soroti town, approves, the suspect will be arrested and prosecuted.</p> <p>In more serious cases, such as murder, villagers are free to call police officers on their mobile phones, whose numbers are freely given out.</p> <p>\"If we are called, we go to the scene using the fastest means of transport available,\" Eriebu says. \"We have one motorcycle.\"</p> <p>Transport and staffing levels are some of the problems facing law enforcement officers in rural areas. Katine sub-county, for instance, does not have a single female officer and cases of defilement have to be referred to the district office in Soroti.</p> <p>LCI chairman Epaku also laments that his work still goes unpaid and he does not even get a bicycle to take him around the village. A few days later, President Museveni, addressing a rally in Soroti town, says he has not forgotten his 2006 campaign promise to give salaries to LC officials; that he will do once the budget allows.</p>",
  "<p>A man who ran an illegal arms factory converting replica submachine guns into lethal weapons was today sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 11 years.</p> <p>At least eight people, including Michael Dosunmu, a teenager, were killed by weapons converted by Grant Wilkinson in a shed in Berkshire.</p> <p>Dosunmu was shot by mistake as he slept in his bed in Peckham, south London. Another of Wilkinson's guns was used to murder PC Sharon Beshenivsky in a robbery three years ago in Bradford.</p> <p>Wilkinson, 34, was convicted yesterday at Reading crown court of buying replica MAC-10 submachine guns and converting them to fire. Police said his operation was one of the largest they had ever discovered. They believe it produced 90 guns which were responsible for a fifth of shootings in the capital over two years.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas claiming to be involved in the making of a James Bond movie. Forensic scientists have linked his weapons and bullets he made to 52 shootings across Britain including nine murders.</p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent George Turner, who led the Thames Valley police investigation, said: \"There can be no underestimating the impact of Wilkinson's actions - his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people. We have significantly disrupted an organised crime group that had been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson paid \u00a3500 for the replica MAC-10s, which are made in the UK. After conversion, they were sold for \u00a32,500, including ammunition. It is believed middlemen sold them on to criminal gangs.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas from <a href=\" http://www.sabredefence.com/\">Sabre Defence Industries</a>, which had supplied previous Bond movie productions. Using the false name Wilson, he bought 90 guns and ammunition in batches and paid \u00a355,000 in cash.</p> <p>Sabre director Guy Savage became suspicious of Wilkinson, who he said was \"desperately disorganised\", and secretly took his photograph on his mobile phone. The picture was handed to police. Savage told the court: \"He was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.\"</p> <p>The gun factory was discovered by chance. Wilkinson did his work in two garden sheds behind a derelict property in Three Mile Cross, near Reading.</p> <p>One shed was used as a workshop and the other was sound-proofed as a firing range for testing. Police were called in July 2007 after tenants in a nearby house came across the sheds.</p> <p>Officers discovered expensive industrial equipment used to smelt and cut metals. They found 27,700 spent cartridges at one shed and another site. The cartridges had been bought from gun clubs and could be reloaded.</p> <p>Police had already started to link several of the shootings, and when the sheds were reported they made the connection within a few days.</p> <p>Dosunmu was sprayed with bullets from a MAC-10 after his killers mistook him for his older brother, whom they had intended to kill in a criminal feud.</p> <p>Wilkinson used his profits to dine at upmarket restaurants and stay at hotels. He was convicted of a series of offences, including conspiracy to convert an imitation firearm into a firearm, conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms and ammunition, possession of a firearm with intent to enable another person to endanger life, and possessing a prohibited firearm, namely a MAC-10 submachine gun. A second man, Garry Lewis, was cleared of all charges.</p> <p>The use of MAC-10s had previously been rare. Police say even their own firearms officers have difficulty using a MAC-10 accurately.</p> <p>Turner said: \"It is clear that the usage in crimes in the UK of MAC-10s can be directly linked to the factory.\"</p> <p>Of the 90 replicas bought by Wilkinson, police fear that all were converted. Eleven were found at the factory or nearby, and 39 were recovered after police investigations. Police yesterday offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the outstanding 40 weapons. It is feared most of them are in the hands of London gangsters.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe, of the Trident independent advisory group, which monitors the way police investigate shootings involving black teenagers in London, said: \"The availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets.\"</p>",
  "<p>A brothel owner who smuggled five Thai women into Australia to work as prostitutes today had her conviction for sex slavery upheld by the country's high court.</p> <p>Wei Tang was sentenced to 10 years in prison for holding the women as sex slaves.

  "<p>August bank holiday week, and it must be the quietest of the year for British politics. And one of the most exciting in the US. Whether you support Barack Obama or not, whether he wins in November or not, this week we are witnessing history in the making, a revived American dream. </p> <p>Obama and Joe Biden may embody the dream, but they're well aware, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.democrats20085\">Bill Clinton told the convention</a>, that, for many Americans, their dream is \"under siege\", with rising inequality and poverty in the land of the free market. </p> <p>We like to think we do better here.

Good news, especially given that the best-connected parents still tend to send their kids out of the borough (our local Labour MP included). Meanwhile Lord Adonis (Islington resident and unrepentant Blairite), is calling for a massive expansion of the academies programme. </p> <p>Under Tony Blair it was made very clear to councils that academies were an offer they couldn't refuse. Now it looks as if that will continue under Gordon Brown. But Islington's best-performing schools aren't academies. So do academies really make a difference? Especially since the Building Schools for the Future programme means secondaries don't have to become academies to get better buildings. </p> <p>If the government really believes its own rhetoric on localism, and believes that local communities should have choices around schools, that must include the choice to reject the academy model. </p> <p>Next month I'm off to Bournemouth for <a href=\"www.libdems.org.uk/conference\">Lib Dem party conference</a>, where one of the issues for debate is improving direct democracy in the UK. Two of the most interesting proposals are for \"people's bills\" and a \"people's veto\". </p> <p>With people's bills, the six bills that got the most petition signatures each year would be guaranteed a second reading debate in the House of Commons. It wouldn't mean the law would get passed - that responsibility would still sit with MPs - but it would mean that citizens could set the agenda.</p> <p>With a people's veto, if 1 million registered voters petitioned against an act within 60 days of its being passed, a referendum would be held on whether to repeal it. That could give us a real national debate on nuclear power, ID cards, or a third runway at Heathrow. </p> <p>The impact of having people - and politicians - aware that voters can really influence the agenda between elections could be revolutionary. A similar process already works in the <a href=\"http://maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/pets02/pets02-1.htm\">US state of Maine</a>. Their state motto is Dirigo (I lead). Where they lead, perhaps we should follow. </p> <p>Party conferences are memorable for all sorts of reasons. I'll always associate the Harrogate conference of September 1992 with Black Wednesday. The day interest rates went through the roof, I was worried about losing mine. A group of us abandoned plans for a restaurant meal and contemplated life in negative equity over jacket potatoes instead. There was a chill in the air that had nothing to do with the north Yorkshire weather.</p> <p>Now with <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7584877.stm\">falling house prices, but rising housing costs</a>, it's happening again. Last year repossessions hit a 15-year high. More families are facing the horror of losing their homes \u2013 and joining the long queue for affordable rented housing. </p> <p>So it's good to see that at this year's Lib Dem conference, Vince Cable will be setting out our plans for people who are getting left behind. </p> <p>It's not about subsidising mortgages, but practical measures to help people stay in their homes with help from housing associations, and to help councils get more social housing too. </p> <p>Once again Vince is providing excellent free advice to the government: but is Labour listening? <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2008/08/the-treasury-minister-who-thought-the-housing-crash-was-a-joke/\">Unlikely given the complacency of Ministers reported by the FT</a>.</p>",
  "<p>General practice is one of jewels in the crown of the NHS's proud heritage of patient care. But the government seems to be rushing towards greater private sector involvement that could change the character of general practice forever.<br><br>For the first couple of months after Gordon Brown became prime minister, it seemed that he was pulling back from the privatising excesses of his predecessor. But then the government awarded a framework primary care contract to private companies, and health secretary Alan Johnson gave backing for the private sector in 150 new health centres and 100 new GP practices.</p> <p>I recently put to Alan Johnson that the NHS is being seriously wounded by privatisation. He disagreed, saying that around 5% of total NHS activity is provided by the private sector, and using the private sector in elective surgery had reduced waiting lists dramatically.</p> <p>He added: \"All of the services provided are NHS services and we have ended the ability of the private sector to apply spot pricing 40% higher than NHS rates by imposing a single tariff which means that the operation costs the same irrespective of where its carried out. </p> <p>\"We have no predisposition towards the private sector\u2026 but GPs and pharmacists have always been private contractors to the NHS and there is no socialist principle being abrogated here. Our focus must be on outcomes.\" <br>It is a shame that Johnson felt the need to roll out the tired argument that GPs are akin to private corporations. There are fundamental differences between the small, self-employed nature of general practices and those that in the future could be operating under the auspices of large companies.</p> <p>In the former, owners have a strong incentive to make savings - but these are mitigated by the fact that they must suffer the results. If I sack half my staff to save money, I will have to work in the building afterwards while chaos reigns. Also, the 'owner' is usually a member of the community that the practice serves and feels a bond to that community in a way that cannot be achieved by a corporation. There is no substitute for professional GPs who work in practices they own with a team they take pride in.</p> <p>Of course, improvements can always be made to how we deliver care, and we must deal with the rising expectations of patients, coupled with the rapid development of new technologies and treatments. But what will commercialism achieve? </p> <p>A practice with the shareholders' interests at the fore may be tempted to cream off the fit and well from their patient list, leaving the vulnerable and chronically ill with their loyal, less well-resourced practice. As that practice is squeezed by falling resources and rising care demands, they may ultimately have to rely on health professionals recruited from abroad on short-term contracts. So continuity of care, which patients value most, will be lost.</p> <p>Primary care trusts, which control most of the NHS's \u00a3100bn budget, are now being encouraged to buy advice from 14 selected private companies on health needs, contracts and local provision. Large companies are being invited to bid to provide new so-called GP-led health centres, popularly known as polyclinics, rather than building up existing general practices. </p> <p>Why is this being done? There is no systematic evidence that commercial companies provide better quality more efficiently. </p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) rightly argues in a report marking the 60th anniversary of the NHS that increasing the role of the private sector in the UK health system will not make the service more efficient.</p> <p>Governments that have tried to shift costs from the public to private purse rarely save and sometimes increase costs. For example, France's system of high charges for services such as seeing a doctor or treatment as an outpatient has not controlled their rising healthcare budget.</p> <p>The report also argues against attempts to fund this \"health gap\" by shifting costs from the public to the private purse\u2014for example, by more private insurance, or co-payments. Instead, governments should raise public funding if they want to meet demand for healthcare efficiently. </p> <p>What the NHS needs is an evidence-based plan for reducing unacceptable variations in access and quality, using geographically based integrated services led by general practitioners and secondary care clinical leaders, and paid for by the millions currently wasted on re-disorganisation. </p> <p>What the NHS does not need is another wave of commercialisation and market-based theories that throw away the pillars of what is, at heart, a successful model of healthcare. </p> <p>\u0095 Kailash Chand is a GP and BMA council member</p>",

Of the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/employersandsponsors/listemployerspenalties/\">45 businesses listed</a>, as of July 31, 40 were food outlets. The majority of these - Madras restaurant, Manor Park, London (three illegal employees); Birmingham's Fat Boy Chippy (one); Sisi Pizza, Leeds (five); Spice of Rice, Bolton (one); Zara's, Dronfield (two); Rye Grill, Sussex (one); Thai House, Plymouth (one); <a href=\"http://www.kirkintilloch-herald.co.uk/news/Chinese-takeaway-in-Kirkintilloch.4227749.jp\">Moon River Restaurant</a>, Kirkintilloch, Glasgow (four) - are takeaways and restaurants with localised profiles, but there is one High Street name on the list. In June, the Cardiff branch of the \"contemporary Italian\" chain <a href=\"http://www.strada.co.uk\">Strada</a> - praised by our own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2007/aug/05/foodanddrink.restaurants\">Jay Rayner</a> for doing \"good work\" in introducing Britain to authentic wood-fired pizza - was prosecuted for employing one undocumented worker (the less loaded term, favoured by progressives), and fined \u00a35,000. Strada declined to comment on this. <br><br>Critics of the new UK Border Agency tactics are concerned on a number of fronts. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/16/humanrights.immigrationpolicy\">Writing in the Guardian recently, Hsiao-Hung Pai</a> painted a pitiful picture of the undocumented workers at the bottom of this chain, and questioned why so many ethnic minority small businesses - often food businesses which make easy targets due to their High Street prominence - had been hit, when illegal immigrants can be found working in numerous industries, often for white-British employers. It risked, wrote Pai, \"scapegoating communities\".</p> <p>That this comes at the same time as a new points-based system for skilled overseas workers is about to be introduced, which, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/22/immigration.foodanddrink\">say many restaurateurs</a>, threatens to make it prohibitively difficult to recruit foreign chefs, leaves many, particularly Asian owners, feeling as if they're being attacked from all sides. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/feb/29/currycrisis\">As discussed in these pages back in February</a> <a href=\"http://www.gbruk.org.uk/\">The Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs</a> is adding its voice to <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1638\">warnings of a \"curry crisis\"</a>. </p> <p>While broadly welcoming the naming and shaming policy, Joanne Pitts, an employment consultant at Croner, said: \"It's important that these moves do not come down too hard on businesses that <a href=\"http://www.croner.co.uk/croner/jsp/Editorial.do?cache=true&amp;channelId=-291925&amp;contentId=1008873&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=yes\">on one occasion unknowingly employed an illegal migrant worker</a>.\" However, the Home Office insists that only businesses that knowingly employ undocumented workers will be prosecuted.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/\">TUC</a>, meanwhile, sees this new policy as window dressing, \"locking the stable door after the bad employer has bolted\", as General Secretary <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_bbarber.cfm\">Brendan Barber</a> has put it. Senior policy officer, Nicola Smith, says the emphasis should be on prevention, starting with robust protection of all workers' rights: \"The TUC wants all workers to have rights under UK employment law, and for immigration status not to come into it.\" Employers, for instance, are currently exempt from prosecution for not paying the minimum wage to undocumented workers. \"Our position is that everyone should be treated in the way parliament intended when it set a benchmark for employment standards.\" </p> <p>In this way, it is argued, you would reduce demand for and offer some protection to undocumented workers who are currently at the mercy of exploitative employers, and simultaneously shore up the rights of legitimate staff. The TUC would also like to see, \"opportunities for earned regularisation\" for undocumented workers, \"rather than this fallacy that everyone can be deported\". Smith continues: \"These people are doing low-skilled, nasty jobs. If they all disappeared tomorrow we would have a big labour shortage.\"</p> <p>The TUC's suggestions would obviously be the most humane way to proceed. The 'naming and shaming' policy, you sense, panders to a right-wing tabloid anti-immigration agenda, rather than doing anything to tackle the root problems. But it still leaves us, as diners, with a dilemma. Now that this information is out there, is it incumbent upon us, as good Guardian readers, to boycott eateries which have been prosecuted for employing undocumented workers?</p> <p>\"We would advocate people looking very carefully at how all businesses treat their workers, in all sorts of ways,\" says Smith. Do you? Have you ever boycotted a restaurant because of the way it treats its staff? Proposed government action notwithstanding, if the <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/food/2008/07/tipping_point_finally_reached.html\">Unite Fair Tips</a> campaign in Manchester goes national, will it change your eating habits? Or is it down to chefs and waiters, rather than the diner, to take a stand? </p> <p>Moreover, why don't we hear more about apparently model employers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2006/sep/24/foodanddrink.recipes1\">like Giorgio Locatelli</a>? It is impossible to personally ethically audit every restaurant you eat in, but is there a desire for restaurants to advertise their good practices - on tips, staff hours, wages - as loudly as they trumpet their local, seasonal produce?</p>",
  "<p>Shabana Azmi, an Indian actor, recently kicked up a stir by claiming that Muslims <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/3371893.cms\">cannot easily buy homes</a> in Mumbai. This may well be true: but as someone who recently looked for a place to rent in the city, I assure Azmi that there is a category of person even less wanted in this city than the Muslim. I belong to this category.</p> <p>Mumbai's real-estate market suffers from a perpetual shortage of good, affordable housing. Landlords are picky. The lack of any real anti-discrimination law in the city means that the rental market is a bigot's paradise. Some landlords rent only to non-Muslims; some turn down Hindus; some permit only vegetarians in their flats. But almost none of them will gladly rent to a bachelor.</p> <p>In the rest of the world, unmarried men are called by their proper, varied names \u2013 singleton, gay, divorced, celibate \u2013 but Indian society still lumps them into one Victorian-era category: the <em>bachelor</em>. And the landlords of Mumbai want nothing to do with this fellow. Where the bachelor lives, there the orgy follows; this is the great fear. In the landlord's imagination, half-clad women appear and disappear all day long through the bachelor's door; gasps of illicit pleasure rent the middle-class composure of the building; disgrace and scandal follow. Interestingly, the unmarried woman is not regarded as a sexually depraved type, and many landlords are prepared to rent to them. It is only the bachelor who is taboo.</p> <p>Like so many of the stereotypes cherished by Indians, this one needs to go. All the unmarried men I know are hard at work \u2013 on a screenplay, a novel, or trying to find a wife. It's the fellows with the wedding rings, I notice, who get up to the debauchery. But even in India's most liberal city, old attitudes are surprisingly resilient.</p> <p>I spent a week looking for places \u2013 and got told the same thing every time I liked a flat. Even if the landlord was bachelor-tolerant, he was helpless; many of Mumbai's buildings have rules that explicitly forbid unmarried men from renting or buying apartments. Especially <em>my</em> kind of unmarried man. Three species of bachelors inhabit Mumbai, it turns out. First comes the \"company bachelor\" \u2013 the fellow who works for American Express or another multinational; most landlords will take him on, grudgingly. Lower down the real-estate food chain is the \"married bachelor\" \u2013 who is living alone, but has a wife in Canada (or so he says). Last comes the \"single bachelor\" \u2013 no company job, no wife in Canada. This is me. Making things worse is that I describe myself as a \"writer\", a category that doesn't mean anything to the landlords of Mumbai; any young man sitting in front of a computer and typing all day must be playing games of some kind. Instead of doing solid, virtuous things like looking for a wife. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.mumbai-tour-packages.com/images/versova.jpg\">Versova</a>, a beach suburb in the far north of the city, I saw a second-floor sea-facing apartment with large glass windows. The waves came almost to the foot of the building. I imagined myself here, at a table, drawing energy from the ocean and hammering away on a Remington: I could turn out a hundred pages a day here \u2013 I could write a Les Miserables in a year.</p> <p>\"Just one question,\" the landlady said on the day we were to sign the lease. \"When is your wife coming to join you?\" </p> <p>I explained; she stopped smiling. </p> <p>\"The last tenant was a married bachelor,\" she said. \"He had a wife in Delhi, but he lived alone in this flat. And guess what he was doing here?\"</p> <p>\"Tell me,\" I said, my heart sinking.</p> <p>\"He was familiar with young ladies.\"</p> <p>\"You don't say.\"</p> <p>\"And he was <em>coolly</em> running a brothel service. In this very flat.\"</p> <p>The waves at Versova will never beat near my Remington. Some other writer will finish his Les Miserables in that flat \u2013 with his wife looking over his shoulder.</p> <p>After two weeks of hunting, I did find a place \u2013 at a price far below what I was prepared to pay, and in a part of town with too much noise and pollution. I'd like to get out of here in a few months, but where can a bachelor go? A cousin of mine suggests that there is only one solution: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/08/familyandrelationships.healthandwellbeing\">marriage</a>. Otherwise I should just pack up and move to Bangalore. He's probably right. I love Mumbai, but my time here may be drawing to an end. This city's not for bachelors.</p>",
  "<p>American political conventions are always, to some degree, about theatre - but even by those standards, Wednesday in Denver was extraordinary: a day of carefully staged but highly emotional drama in which Barack Obama officially won the Democratic nomination, and no less significantly was handed the party's torch by both Clintons. </p> <p>The Obama and Clinton camps negotiated up to the last minute on how to choreograph the traditional roll call vote so as to placate Hillary-supporting delegates without risking any embarrassing displays of disunity. In the event, Clinton herself agreed to step forward to call off the public vote count, awarding the nomination to Obama. Bill Clinton followed up with a supercharged endorsement of the freshly minted nominee. But by the end of the evening, there was a palpable sense that the Clintons' era was closing, and a new one beginning.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.itv.com/News/Articles/MPs-call-for-energy-windfall-tax-720947591.html\">Taxing excess profits</a> to recompense over-charged consumers is a strange way to proceed. Why not ask why are people being over-charged in the first place?</p> <p>The argument for a windfall tax is that energy suppliers have raised their prices by more than their own costs have risen. This does indeed <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=407198&amp;in_page_id=2\">seem</a> to have happened. But how?</p> <p>In theory, there's no reason why rises in the cost of inputs should increase traders' profits; if anything, the reverse should be expected. Traders might need to raise prices, but far from widening margins they might actually have to cut them, if demand proves elastic. The need to compete on price to attract and retain customers is supposed to keep margins in check whatever happens to costs.</p> <p>This process is working splendidly in the food business. As wholesale costs rise, supermarkets are eroding profit margins in order to compete against each other with ever more aggressive price <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2008/08/14/bcntesco114.xml\">cuts</a>. In the domestic hardware sector too, Argos, Currys and Comet remain <a href=\"http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Browse/ID69/Price+Cut/r_1/1%7CPrice+Cut%7CYes%7C1.htm\">intent</a> on out-competing each other on price. </p> <p>Of course, this model breaks down where a commercially run utility enjoys an effective monopoly, as do water suppliers, for example. Yet the market in domestic fuel supply could hardly be more competitive. Creating a proper market in fuel was the reason given for denationalising the industry. And now, doorstep nuisances and cold callers bombard us daily with urgent injunctions to switch horses.<br> So, how have energy companies been able to beat the system? The answer is that consumers have failed in their thankless task of policing prices. It's not their fault. They can see the difference between the price of a bottle of Heinz ketchup in Tesco and Asda. Trying to compare fuel prices is different.</p> <p>\"Tiered\" structures and \"sculpted\" tariffs make the eyes glaze over. Some prices may look high, but are fixed for a set period. Some tariffs will involve a standing charge; some won't. Varying adjustments will be made for the method of payment used. Altogether, around <a href=\"http://www.easier.com/view/Finance/Household_Bills/Gas_and_Electricity/article-192872.html\">14,000</a> tariffs are available. And if you think you've found the best offer, the company you've chosen, or one of its rivals, will be changing its tariff shortly after you've switched to it, and your calculations will all need to be done afresh.</p> <p>Websites exist to help you make your decision. However, if you try different sites, you may well get <a href=\"http://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2008/08/01/ofgem-the-regulator-is-listening-good-stuff/\">different</a> recommendations. Suppliers may <a href=\"http://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2008/08/01/ofgem-the-regulator-is-listening-good-stuff/\">withhold</a> some tariffs from the sites. Matters have got so complicated that some say we need a site to compare switching sites.</p> <p>In view of all this, it's hardly surprising that most of us never change our fuel suppliers, or if we do so once, don't do it again. Why, then, don't energy companies make their tariffs simpler? The answer is that \"confusion pricing\" suits them nicely. By freeing them from effective price competition, it enables them to behave as a cartel, collectively widening their margins by stealth.</p> <p>When markets fail, it's the duty of the state to intervene. In <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/OfgemHome.aspx\">Ofgem</a>, the energy industry already has regulator with extensive sway.

Certainly, but a more tightly controlled market would serve us better than random acts of state profit-plundering.</p>",

Time, surely, for a reality injection, a timely reminder: 'Remember, Caesar, thou art mortal'. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.gordonramsay.com/petrus/chef/chefpatron/\">Wareing</a> is the blistering young talent, clearly chafing under the restraint of Ram-Bo's perfectionist/thug schtick. He runs just one restaurant, brilliantly, constantly present at the passe, caring only for the food. We should stand and cheer. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hardens.com/\">Harden's</a> is the upstart restaurant guide that took exception to Michelin's high-handed and seemingly bonkers ratings and decided they could do better themselves. A new voice \u2026 an honest broker. We should surely applaud. </p> <p>I'll tell you what \u2026 why don't I just point you at Joseph Campbell or possibly <a href=\"http://www.mckeestory.com/\">Robert McKee's 'Story Seminars'</a> and you can just fill in the rest of this soaring, epic struggle for yourself. 90 minutes, three acts, redemptive ending \u2026 Christ, it's beautiful. </p> <p>Yep, we should be thrilled. So why do I feel like taking a very long shower with some wire wool and a bottle of disinfectant? </p> <p>Yesterday, Harden's made the announcement that they were crowning Wareing the new king of British cuisine at least in part because Ramsay was ' \u2026 chasing media attention across the globe'. Ramsay's company, GRH, accused Hardens of negative spin to 'generate publicity' for their guide. </p> <p>Meanwhile Wareing, as befits a man trying to be taken seriously as a chef is keeping quiet \u2026 oh, apart from the <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/food/celebritiesandarticles/chefs/2008/August/marcuswareing.aspx\">brilliantly timed profile in Waitrose Food Illustrated</a> where he revealed that he 'wouldn't give a fuck' if he never saw his foul-mouthed boss again before suggesting that GordonBalls should \"Put a gun to my head, shoot me, put me in a box and bury me because if you don't, I'll come back and come back. I'll never give up until I get where I want to go.\"</p> <p>Who's scripting this stuff? It's brilliant. It's like Max Clifford meets John Milius. </p> <p>As we watch our best chefs and critics spinning and attention-seeking like 3-year-olds at a party, I'm glad everyone's talking in rough, tough, no-bullshit expletives. It gives us, the audience expected to buy this artificial, PR generated bollocks the opportunity to say 'stuff the lot of them - who gives a fuck?'</p>",
  "<p><br> Dan Fredenburgh in Heinrich von Kleist's play The Prince of Homburg. Photograph: John Haynes/RSC</p> <p>In one of the last notes he wrote before shooting himself in 1811, Heinrich von Kleist commented that \"the world is a strange set-up\". This notion, as terrible as it is mundane, is conveyed repeatedly in the eight tales that represent his slim but influential contribution to the development of the short story. </p> <p>Writing at the time of ETA Hoffmann, Goethe and Schiller, Kleist seems far less distant from modern sensibilities than those other exemplars of <a href=\"http://www.litencyc.com/php/stopics.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1353\">German Romanticism</a>. This is partly a matter of style: his prose is remarkably deadpan, at times reading more like a legal brief than a story, while his typical subject matter marries the traditional folktale with a psychologically astute realism (not unlike the approach adopted by Akutagawa in Japan a century later). It comes as no surprise that <a href=\"http://www.kafka-franz.com/kafka-Biography.htm\">Franz Kafka</a> eulogised him as one of the four writers he considered his \"true blood-relations\".</p> <p>Kleist was a child of the Enlightenment, but his reading of Kant led him to the conclusion, as the German literature scholars David Luke and Nigel Reeves have it, that \"human nature, our own selves, were a riddle, everything that has seemed straightforward became ambiguous and baffling.\" In his early 20s he resigned his commission in the Prussian army and abandoned himself, as Robert Walser puts it in his story Kleist in Thun, \"to the entire catastrophe of being a poet\". His writings are battlegrounds across which swarm the forces of doubt, paradox and psychological crisis.</p> <p>For all the sedulous care Kleist takes in presenting his stories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/feb/01/theatre.artsfeatures\">as reasoned investigations into unreason</a> (ghosts, possessions and apparent paradoxes recur) he remains constantly aware of the utility of drama, never averse to sudden changes in perspective or a confounding flurry of twists. A narrative such as The Foundling, in which an adopted son's scheming leads to seduction and murder, sparks with energy. Kleist leads the reader with total assurance into a maze of lust, deceit and evil. Crafting a perfect storm of unlikely but plausible coincidences, he manages to pull off the thriller writer's trick of making darkness and physical and psychological violence not only compelling, but exciting. What lifts The Foundling beyond being just a masterclass in suspense, however, is Kleist's determination in pursuing the corrupting effects of such actions to their grotesque ends.</p> <p>Similarly, The Betrothal in Santo Domingo exerts an extraordinary page-turning force while transcending mere gruesome entertainment, this time playing on racial prejudice. Written shortly after the Haitian Revolution, where the slave population overthrow their French rulers, it uses the love story of a mestiza and a European to subvert the idea of a hierarchy of race-based virtue. It also features another prominently Kleistian trope: that of love being tested by circumstance.</p> <p>This theme surfaces in several of Kleist's major works, and casts an interesting light on his repeated assertion that reality is ultimately an unfathomable hall of mirrors. \"You should not have mistrusted me\" are the heartrending dying words of one character in The Betrothal in Santo Domingo, drawing attention to the fact that Kleist, for all his suicidal urges and fascination with evil, was no nihilist. It is perhaps this fact that gives his stories, so dark in their obsessions and often ending in death or despair, their magnificent impact. Nihilism, one comes to realise, is an easy option when compared with the agony of a repeatedly thwarted humanism.</p> <p>Such agony is plainly displayed in The Earthquake in Chile, which alongside The Foundling stands as perhaps Kleist's most striking story. It opens with a young man about to hang himself in prison, and concludes with a mob believing they are doing God's work by tearing two lovers and a baby to pieces outside the only church in the city left standing by the earthquake. It could not be said to be short on incident, and neither could its brevity be taken as a sign of a lack of ambition, struggling as it does with the most devilish knots in theological, moral and philosophical debate. It also foregrounds the hope Kleist expressed twice in letters in 1806 that, despite the evidence, the world is not in thrall to an evil deity, only a misunderstood one. At its end a survivor looks at the child he will now raise as his own and concludes, \"it almost seemed to him that he had reason to feel glad.\" In that \"almost\" there exists both the weakly flickering hope and mountainous sorrow that combines so often in Kleist's work, and generates its uncanny power.</p> <p><strong>Next:</strong> Franz Kafka</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago, Dr Bouthaina <a href=\"http://www.charlierose.com/guests/buthaina-shaaban\">Shaaban</a>, Syria's minister of expatriates, gave a speech in Damascus about the role of women. She recalled a story about an Arab woman who toured the United States in the 19th century, trying to persuade Americans to liberate their women, to allow them to move out of the home and into the workplace. How times have changed. (Although perhaps not that much: one is still lecturing the other.)</p> <p>Shaaban, better known to western audiences as a regular voice for the Assad government on English television networks, is one of the Arab world's most prominent feminists. She will be one of the keynote <a href=\"http://www.feminismeislamic.org/eng/\">speakers</a> at this year's International Congress on Islamic Feminism in Barcelona, along with Britain's Baroness Uddin and the American professor Amina Wadud, who gained notoriety when she <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4361931.stm\">led</a> a mixed gender prayer group in New York.</p> <p>Even in this one conference, one can see the threads of dissent among feminists in the Arab and Muslim worlds. Some, like Shaaban, come from a secular perspective, whereas Wadud looks to Islamic principles for her feminism. Both, however, use the language and example of Islam \u2013 and that has been their downfall.</p> <p>Those feminists who come out of a more secular tradition tend to emphasise individual empowerment as a societal good. Thus traditional routes to gender equality \u2013 education, work and laws \u2013 are acclaimed because they allow societies to progress. In her speech, Shaaban quoted Syria's former president Hafez Al Assad saying: \"A society must not work with half its members, but must rather work with full power and all its members.\"</p> <p>But those days of appeals to patriotic ideals \u2013 as happened in the heyday of Egyptian feminism, in the 1950s \u2013 are gone. Today the appeal is made to Islamic ideals. When the doyen of secular Arab feminism, the writer Nawal El Saadawi <a href=\"http://www.darkmatter101.org/site/2008/02/13/nawal-el-saadawi-in-conversation/\">says</a> that \"Women who wear the veil and say they choose to do so are either lying or ignorant\" \u2013 at a time when Arab women across the region are reclaiming it as their right, it is clear the parameters have shifted. Take a walk through the urban centres of Cairo or Damascus \u2013 or even Beirut \u2013 and it is clear that those days of mini-skirts on every corner in the 1970s (as almost everyone in those cities seems to remember) are gone. There is a new reality in the region.</p> <p>That reality is Islam. The rise of political Islam has affected even feminism. The Islamic feminists have a more individualistic model. For them, gender equality and empowerment is more a factor of being a good Muslim, of living an ideal Islamic life.</p> <p>Wadud \u2013 like two other feminists, the US academic Margot Badran and the Moroccan doctor and writer Asma Lamrabet, both of whom will be at the conference \u2013 argue that the codification of Islamic law that took place during the 9th century drew heavily on patriarchal traditions of the day and thus, perhaps unwittingly, watered down the clear principles of equality they believe are found in the Qur'an. They aim their efforts at <a href=\"http://www.qantara.de/webcom/show_article.php/_c-478/_nr-721/i.html\">reinterpreting</a> the religious texts.</p> <p>Secular feminists, conscious of the way the language of Islam has permeated the Middle East, have tended to try and articulate their ideas of gender equality in Islamic terms (by, for instance, pointing out the wives of Islam's founder were <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadijah_bint_Khuwaylid\">businesswomen</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha\">army commanders</a>). The problem, however, is that that language of Islam, or religious reform, has been so totally appropriated by political Islam, that even when feminists who begin from a secular point of view use it, it sounds religious. When Islamic feminists use it, they are playing on the Islamists pitch, with an immediate disadvantage.</p> <p>Take the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7543559.stm\">burning</a> of women's schools in Pakistan (and <a href=\"http://www.msmagazine.com/fall2006/schoolsout.asp\">Afghanistan</a>). The now-resurgent Taliban say they are doing this because Islamic law forbids women's education; the Islamic feminists reply that in fact education is a religious <a href=\"http://www.answering-christianity.com/education.htm\">duty</a>. It becomes a theological argument. Remember who wins theological arguments? The side with the most guns.</p> <p>There is a way back. Feminism in the Arab and Islamic worlds, like feminism in the west, is struggling to find ways to remain relevant to a new generation. In the west, feminism's trajectory was derailed from its early successes by increased freedom, legislation and materialism. There is a strong sense among women that feminism \u2013 as it is usually understood \u2013 no longer provides answers. It doesn't even provide the right questions.</p> <p>There is something of that, too, in the Islamic worlds. Feminism seems like a luxury, and a decadent one at that, unable to provide answers to pressing questions such as political reform, the end of foreign occupations, and the rise of political Islam. Worse, much feminism, in its haste to show how its ideas have Arab and Muslim roots \u2013 and are not just western imports, as their detractors charge \u2013 has looked too much to the past: to Islamic history, to Arab writers, to more open times. But feminists, of whatever stripe, need to show how their ideas can solve the problems that Jordanian and Indonesian and African and European women experience today. The problems of poverty, of education, of discriminatory laws. They need to show, for example, how better laws, and not more religion, can provide a solution to sexual harassment and violence in the region (a topic I will be writing about in a subsequent piece). Until then, they will always be talking the Islamists' language \u2013 and not even speaking it well.</p>",
  "<p>Consumers must accept that higher fuel prices are here to stay, the business secretary said today.</p> <p>John Hutton admitted that some households would struggle to pay their heating bills this winter but defended huge price hikes imposed by energy companies recently. </p> <p>Hutton also called for British Energy and EDF to hammer out a deal in the next two weeks for the French utility company to take over the nuclear producer. </p> <p>\"The era of cheap energy is over.

Britain needs more energy suppliers. It's harder to for us to have those energy relationships with countries that behave in the way Russia has been doing lately.\"</p> <p>Energy security is a more important issue than climate change, Hutton said.</p> <p>\"Of course we've got to tackle climate change, it's a real and present danger for us, but we've also got to be absolutely clear that our energy policy has got to be figured first and foremost with a view to supplying Britain with affordable and secure energy it needs for the future.</p> <p>\"That is why we cannot turn our back on any proven form of technology. We cannot afford to say no to new coal, new gas or new nuclear.\"</p> <p>Speaking about EDF's renewed efforts to take control of British Energy after it's initial bid was rejected by shareholders, Hutton said: \"We need to make progress with that transaction as quickly as we possibly can. HMG is a minority shareholder.</p> <p>\"It's for the majority of shareholders to come to a view about how they want the future of that company to be addressed. We are clear that the EDF deal is a good one. It will allow us to fast-track nuclear development.\"</p> <p>According to Energywatch, a consumer watchdog, the average UK household gas bill has risen by 31% this year and by 160% since 2003. Electricity bills are up by 22% and 96% over the same period.</p> <p>Around 4.5m households are classed as \"fuel poor\" \u2013 ie they spend more than 10% of their incomes to heat their homes to an adequate standard of warmth - a number that has doubled since 2004 and is expected to continue rising.</p> <p>Seventy Labour MPs have signed a petition calling for a one-off tax on the \"excessive profits\" of the energy companies but Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown are refusing to impose the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/28/energy.corporatesocialresponsibility\">windfall tax</a> because they fear the energy firms will just pass the costs back to the customers.</p> <p>Despite the recent wave of huge price hikes, Hutton used the newspaper interview to defend energy firms against claims they are ripping customers off.</p> <p>\"Making a profit is better than making a loss and if we want these companies to invest significant resources investors are not going to do that if they don't think there's a reasonable return to be made on their investment,\" he said.</p> <p>Instead of a one-off windfall tax, ministers will look to the big energy companies to help by offering some discounts to the most poorly off.</p> <p>The government has announced a \u00a350 winter fuel payment for households with someone over 60 and \u00a3100 for households with someone over 80 this year.</p>",

  "<p>Mexico's supreme court will uphold trailblazing abortion laws in the capital by dismissing a challenge from the conservative federal government.</p> <p>Mexico City's law, in effect since April last year, requires city health services to provide a free abortion to any woman who seeks it up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.</p> <p>It was challenged in the supreme court by the chief federal prosecutor, which is a cabinet post in Mexico, and the national human rights ombudsman. They argued that the constitution's guarantee of the right to life obliges the authorities to protect an unborn child from the moment of conception, overriding a woman's right to determine what happens to her body.</p> <p>In a lengthy and televised discussion lasting several days, eight of the 11 justices said they would dismiss the challenge. A decision is due within days, possibly today.</p> <p>Mexico City sits alongside Cuba in having the most liberal abortion legislation in Latin America. One country \u2013 Nicaragua \u2013 has prohibited abortion in all cases since 2006.</p> <p>The law has shattered the longstanding suppression of the abortion debate in Mexico. Politicians and bishops had avoided touching the question for decades, fearful of exposing bitter divisions in a country that values its anti-clerical political tradition as deeply as its Catholic heritage.</p> <p>The laws of most Mexican states, as was the case in Mexico City, allow terminations in cases of rape, danger to the mother's life or catastrophic deformations of the foetus. But in practice, very few women in these situations get the option. The states do not prosecute either the doctors who offer safe illegal abortions for those with money, or the life-threatening backstreet practitioners used by the poor.</p> <p>Many expected tighter controls when the Catholic conservative National Action party took control of the federal government in 2000, after 71 years of one-party rule by the nominally progressive Institutional Revolutionary party. But the right wing remained wary of upsetting the status quo.</p> <p>The leftwing administration in Mexico City eventually took on the taboo, and the discussion has stretched far beyond the supreme court to become an unprecedented national debate. Anti-abortion activists have blasted passers-by with the sound of foetal heart beats, while the Catholic hierarchy ran anti-abortion television commercials in prime time. Feminists have shouted their determination to push for abortion on demand elsewhere in Mexico.</p> <p>About a fifth of the 12,000 women given free abortions in the capital travelled from elsewhere in the country. There are no figures available for the private sector.</p> <p>The majority of public doctors have declared themselves conscientious objectors and refused to do abortions, forcing the city to set up special clinics, some of which have been picketed by activists.</p>",

Menelaus goes in for the kill, but Hector gets him first with a stab through the chest. Very wrong. The real (or real-ish) Menelaus survived the Trojan War, and was happily reunited with Helen afterwards. Petersen also prematurely bumps off Ajax and Agamemnon. At least all these deaths rule out a sequel.</p> <h2>Strategy</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336998371\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/27/troyhorse.jpg\" alt=\"Troy: The Trojan Horse\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Trojans venture out one morning to find the Greeks have vanished, leaving the beach covered in smoking embers, heaps of rubbish and plague-ridden corpses.

A lot of the material in the Iliad is open to question, but Troy still scores low thanks to taking liberties with what evidence there is. The making-of documentary brags about its authentic wobbly bronze swords and meticulously perfect cityscapes, but it's hard to see why you'd go to the trouble if you're just going to fill the marketplace with llamas.</p>",
  "<p>Britain will not accept the redrawing of Europe into spheres of influence, the foreign secretary said today, as he kept the diplomatic pressure on Russia after its recognition of Georgia's breakaway provinces.</p> <p>David Miliband's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme followed a tough statement signed by himself, the foreign ministers of the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, deploring Moscow's \"excessive use of military force\" in Georgia.</p> <p>The statement, described as an \"unprecedented step\" by the Foreign Office, followed a warning from Miliband delivered in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, to the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, that he bore a \"big responsibility\" not to provoke a new cold war.</p> <p>Miliband said Russia's approach was \"anathema\" and belonged to the second world war era of Yalta. He rejected the argument that Nato was an offensive alliance seeking to encircle Russia.</p> <p>The 1945 agreement at the Yalta conference, between the leaders of Britain, the US and the Soviet Union, saw each of the allied powers given a sphere of influence on the globe, with eastern Europe falling under Moscow.</p> <p>In their joint statement, the foreign ministers said Moscow's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violated Georgia's integrity and sovereignty.</p> <p>\"We ... condemn the action of our fellow G8 member. Russia's recognition of the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia and is contrary to UN security council resolutions supported by Russia.\"</p> <p>Miliband said he went to Ukraine yesterday because it was important to say to a friendly country that \"we support their democratic choices\". The foreign secretary reiterated Britain's support for Ukraine's wish to be in Nato and rebuked Russia for treating its neighbours as if they were either \"your enemy of vassal\".</p> <p>Miliband, tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister, went to Kiev to deliver a speech aimed at flying the flag of western democracy on Russia's doorstep, while seeking to avert a new crisis boiling over on the Crimean peninsula, home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow's Black Sea fleet.</p> <p>The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years, delivered in a country that is Russia's neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation.</p> <p>Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe's <br>relations with Russia after nearly two decades of relative tranquility. He said Tuesday's decision by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, to recognise Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe.</p> <p>\"[Medvedev's] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance,\" the foreign secretary said yesterday. \"It is not just the end of the post-cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe. It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law.</p> <p>\"The Georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening.\"</p> <p>He responded to Medvedev's boast that he was not scared of a new cold war, saying: \"We don't want a new cold war. He has a big responsibility not to start one.</p> <p>While Miliband delivered his broadside in Kiev, his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, warned that Ukraine - as well as Moldova, which also has a pro-Russian breakaway region, Transnistria - could become the next targets of a newly assertive Russia.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials say Russia has been distributing passports to ethnic Russians living in Crimea, as it did in South Ossetia. They fear that a row over the use of the base may be employed to stir up separatist sentiment as a precursor to calling for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine.</p> <p>Kiev is also concerned that Russia could orchestrate a conflict over its Black Sea fleet, which is based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol under a lease agreement with Ukraine.</p> <p>Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian president, has riled Moscow by suggesting that Russia should pay a higher rent for Sevastopol and could be subject to more stringent conditions on its use. Miliband urged the Ukrainian government to \"stick to the letter\" of the lease agreement.</p> <p>Last night, G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement condemning Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and deplored Moscow's \"excessive use of military force in Georgia and its continued occupation of parts of Georgia\".</p> <p>Yushchenko, who met Miliband yesterday, said Russian actions in <br>Georgia were unacceptable. \"What has happened is a threat to everyone, not just for one country. Any nation could be next. When we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity, we put into doubt the existence of any country.\"</p>",

RED had previously detected BLU's spying activities, and so tunnelled a secret entrance without their knowledge to counterspy before attacking the facility outright.</p> <p>Constant fighting to take control of the entire facility took place once RED attacked half the facility, the Dam (Fig. 001) and Radar (Fig. 002), cutting off the main entrance to the facility in the process. BLU retained control over the Turbines (Fig. 003) and engineering area (Fig. 004).</p> <p>Special security doors (Fig. 007) were put into action by BLU to stop RED's access to all areas apart from ones BLU wanted to retake, although they also stop their own movements. Access to each of RED or BLU's hardened bunker facilities is only allowed once the rest of the facility is taken due to the power required from the Dam to force open the entrances to the intelligence bunkers (Fig. 005, 006). Even once the facility controlled, reinforcements from the opposing side airdropped in to retake half the facility again, restarting the battle afresh.</p> <p>The entire facility was finally destroyed when the Dam was blown in a espionage activity by both RED and BLU personnel simultaneously (Fig. 008) leaving the area flooded (Fig. 009).</p> <p>Intelligence pictures obtained from BLU and RED agencies, contracts SPY/083875 and SPY/083876.</p> </blockquote> <p>Think you can do better?

  "<p>Conservative blogger Glenn Reynolds asks: <a href=\"http://www.pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/archives2/023553.php\">A Grand Slam Last Night at the DNC</a>? He was actually quoting <a href=\"http://raggedthots.blogspot.com/2008/08/grand-slam.html\">Robert George who said</a>: \"After a couple of uneven nights, the Democrats really hit their stride Wednesday.\" It's a good armchair analysis of the night with both a look to what the Democrats did right last night and what the Republicans can use to respond. But will the Democrats get the bounce they need from the convention?</p> <blockquote> <p>The parade of military figures coming out in support of the Democrats was also impressive, but again, except for people watching on C-SPAN, how much of America saw it?</p> </blockquote> <p>One of those military figures was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLl5H4LR-xw\">retired rear Admiral John Hutson</a>. A little background, he was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hutson\">Judge Advocate General of the Navy</a>, and he testified before the US Senate in 2007 arguing that Guatanamo Detainees <a href=\"http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=2416&amp;wit_id=5771\">should have access to US courts and habeas corpus</a> should not be suspended. Announcing that he had switched allegiance from the Republican Party (also known as the Grand Old Party) to the Democratic Party, he said to cheers: \"The Grand Old Party is no longer Grand. It's just old.\"</p> <p>There were concerns that Bill Clinton would offer a luke-warm endorsement of Barack Obama or that Joe Biden would deliver one of his famous long-winded speeches. But party discipline and political skill were on display. Robert George said that Mr Clinton proved again why he was the \"premiere political master of the last twenty years\".</p> <p>The folks at <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/\">Talking Points Memo</a> gave Joe Biden's speech high marks.</p> <p>Read on for more reaction and blogger coverage of issues outside the hall.</p> <p><a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/DemocraticConvention\">DemocraticConvention</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/Denver\">Denver</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/DNC\">DNC</a>, <a rel=\"tag\" href=\"http://technorati.com/tag/DNC08\">DNC08</a></p> <p>Apart from the speeches, what other issues are getting attention at the convention? Democrats have been courting so-called 'values voters' or more broadly religious voters.</p> <p>At 43rd State Blues, a blog for Idaho Democrats, one blogger complained that at an inter-faith event that there was no 'non-religious' speaker, and with that, he declared himself a \"<a href=\"http://43rdstateblues.com/?q=node/5375\">Democrat No More</a>\".</p> <p>Michael Lerner at BeliefNet, an inter-faith religious site, also <a href=\"http://blog.beliefnet.com/progressiverevival/2008/08/the-high-priests-gathered-to-p.html\">came away unimpressed</a>. And he hoped that Barack Obama stopped his move to the political centre:</p> <blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, in the halls many delegates whispered to each other about the fall in Obama's polling since his campaign started moving to the \"center,\" abandoning its own ideals, and in the process losing its most important asset: the excitement of young people around the U.S. who had allowed themselves this past Winter and Spring to abandon their cynicism and believe that this would not be \"politics as usual\" with the liberal candidate talking peace, justice, an end to militarism and poverty and then qualifying those to death in the actual policies they would back.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another issue that caught my eye was whether the Democrats were ignoring the top issue for most Americans: The economy, stupid. Rich Miller on financial news service Bloomberg accused both parties of ignoring the US financial crisis and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/bloomberg/20080827/pl_bloomberg/a7ogrdxkxse\">failing to offer specifics on how to tackle the mortgage-driven meltdown</a>. On AmericaBlog, <a href=\"http://www.americablog.com/2008/08/is-financial-crisis-really-missing-from.html\">writer Chris in Paris</a> is \"all ears\" for solutions to pressing problems facing the US, and he said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We may not be hearing too many specifics this week or next, but we will surely hear much more substance on the credit crisis in the coming weeks. Neither candidate can afford to ignore the issue and voters won't allow the crisis to be ignored.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p><br>Stranded in the wilderness ... Jared's Leto's 30 Seconds to Mars try to abandon EMI. Photograph: PR</p> <p>Jared Leto's band 30 Seconds to Mars are embroiled in a <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/eonline/20080815/en_music_eo/24143 with EMI\">legal battle</a>. The band has invoked the <a href=\"http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/2855.html\">California Labor Code</a> in an attempt to escape the label. This states that a contract cannot be enforced against an employee after seven years (the band signed their deal in 1999). EMI, in turn, are now exercising their right (stated in the same labour code) to sue the band for violating the terms of contract by refusing to deliver an additional three albums - and they want $30m.</p> <p>30 Seconds to Mars are not the first to resort to the California Labor Code Section 2855 when dissatisfied with the terms of their contract. Created in 1937, it became known as the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN2329585820070824\">\"de Havilland law\"</a>, after actress Olivia de Havilland used it to fight the then oppressive studio contract system. <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805E2DB113AF93BA1575AC0A962958260\">Metallica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11497730_ITM\">Courtney Love</a> - among others - have used it in the past to either get out of or renegotiate their deals.</p> <p>It's easy to see these legal cases as a David v Goliath scenario - the artist fighting the corporation - and, speaking as a musician, I tend take the side of the artist. But I can see the label's point of view too. To launch a new artist on a global scale costs a lot of money. Record labels are companies that don't see a return on their investments for years down the line - if ever.</p> <p>In an online statement, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/18/virginemi-sue-30-seconds-to-mars-for-30-million-leto-fights-back/\">Jared Leto writes</a>: \"If you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2m records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable, well, so do we.\"</p> <p>It's ridiculous, but not entirely unbelievable. Most record deals state that all expenses are recoupable against artists' royalties. Every limo taken, every flight and hotel room, production costs of MTV Awards performances (they're usually paid for by the artist/label), as well as advertising and tour costs - it all adds up, and it's all recoupable. If more artists took into consideration that it's their own money they're spending (that is, if they actually sell enough records to pay back what the label has spent), they might just start driving themselves and flying economy instead of first class.</p> <p>Still, I agree that signing a contract at the beginning of your career that ties you down for a decade or more can be frustrating and unfair. Especially if the label you signed to is then swallowed up by a bigger corporation (I signed to BMG Publishing, but my back catalogue now belongs to Universal, who <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/07/business/fi-bmg7\">bought the company</a>).</p> <p>Jared Leto continues: \"The new regime at EMI is firing most of the people we know and love, wanting to place advertisements on our website, EMI owning 100% of the masters of our record ... forever, and basically having a revolving door of regimes at the company made it easy to not want to continue as is.\"</p> <p>That EMI is suing the band for $30m is beyond excessive. The label says it wants to resolve the matter amicably and continue working with the band \"to take them to even greater levels of success\".</p> <p>The question is: once you've sued someone, what are the chances that you'll have an amicable, productive working relationship? Ask any divorcee. You can't force someone to make a great record and, ultimately, both artists and labels are in the business to make great records. That's why almost every single case like this has been settled out of court.</p> <p>The most likely outcome is that 30 Seconds to Mars will go back to the negotiating table and work out a more favourable contract with EMI, or the label will decide it's not worth the legal costs, cut their losses and walk away - leaving the band free to sign with another label. What do you think are the chances?</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337024292\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Why did Barack Obama pick <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/24/barackobama.joebiden1\">Joe Biden</a> as his running mate? Why not <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/politics/26web-zeleny.html?hp\">someone else</a>? I have asked myself those questions several times in the last 24 hours. Why not, after the votes she won and the convention speech she gave last night, why not pick Hillary Clinton and unite the party? Or why not, I thought as he delivered a hugely competent partisan speech on Wednesday, why not pick the more youthful <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iwJDh_UGvv9R6_Ed85boLPdhnaJAD92R1IJG0\">Evan Bayh</a>?</p> <p>We got some clues to the answer tonight in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/28/uselections2008.joebiden\">Biden's own speech</a>, particularly in the phrase that Biden repeated several times. That phrase \u2014 \"John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right\" \u2014 embodies one of the key battlegrounds in this election. Biden deployed it against one of McCain's greatest perceived strengths, national security. He used it in relation to Afghanistan. He used it in relation to Iran. And he used it in relation to Iraq. Anyone can challenge McCain's ideas on national security issues, but not many Democrats have the seniority and experience to make them stick. Bayh doesn't. Probably Clinton doesn't. Biden, with his deep <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/25/barackobama.joebiden\">background</a> in military and foreign policy issues, is one of the few who unquestionably does. If Biden can get that phrase into the American political conversation over the next ten weeks, then the chances are that Obama-Biden will win on November 4. If he can't then the McCain ticket still has the opportunity to win.</p> <p>It's as simple as that. Even on its own it's a good enough reason for choosing Biden. But there are others, and they were visible elsewhere in tonight's speech. Biden did a good job telling his life story, about growing up in a middle-class Catholic home in Scranton and later in Wilmington. It's a connection that seems tailor made to the contest in the industrial states of the Midwest and the eastern seaboard. The minimum requirements for a vice presidential candidate are that he can attack the other party's nominee and carry his own state. Biden can do both. He looks certain to be parked for much of the next 10 weeks in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, perhaps in New Hampshire and Florida too, where his background and story play well.</p> <p>But if you are looking for the real reason behind the Biden pick, don't look just at the weeks leading up to election day. Look beyond them. One veteran pundit I spoke to in Denver summed up his view of Obama's choice this way. It shows, he said, that Obama is serious about governing. I've heard that line, or something like it, from others this week. Obama, they all say, is confident about how to win the election but less confident about how to govern. Bayh would have been no answer there; he's inexperienced. Clinton certainly would have been an asset in government, and still may be; but at the end of the day she is also who she is. Biden, on the other hand, brings deep insider knowledge, lots of foreign and security policy expertise and \u2013 often overlooked \u2013 a serious track record on crime policy too.</p> <p>At some point in the next 10 weeks Biden may well lose it. That's his style. But he also knows, within 10 seconds of losing it, that he has to fess up, admit to his mistake and move on. His campaigning qualities far exceed his liabilities. But he is an investment for the long term too. And on the strength of the past 24 hours, he is a good one.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, had the bad luck to be speaking after Bill Clinton. Even on his best days, Biden is never going to be as good as the former president, especially when he is on form, as he was last night.</p> <p>But it did not matter. Biden did as much as Clinton to turn round the mood of the Democratic convention. </p> <p>In the morning and afternoon a sense of gloom had descended on the conference. There was grumbling that the convention was too soft-focus and dominated by infighting with the Clintons. And why, they complained, after two days, had there been no sustained attack on the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>Biden answered the latter and in the process explained why Obama had chosen him as his running mate. Obama has opted to stand above the fray, resisting scrapping with McCain, even when on the receiving end of a sustained negative Republican campaign.</p> <p>It is not just a strategic decision. There is also a feeling that the American public might not like to see Obama, at 47 and relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs making personal attacks on the older man and an American hero - even the Democratic convention applauded when Biden mentioned his Vietnam record.</p> <p>That is where Biden comes in. At 65, he is close enough in age to McCain, who turns 72 on Friday, and is his equal in terms of foreign policy experience. Biden is one of the few senior figures inside the Democratic party who can sound credible in challenging McCain. Biden spent about half of his speech in attack dog mode. </p> <p>When he challenged McCain's record on Iraq and Afghanistan, he did so, as he told the convention, from a position of having been to those countries. And, in knocking McCain down, saying he had underestimated the need for more troops in Afghanistan and fewer in Iraq, he was also building up Obama: he was making the case that Obama was capable of being the next commander-in-chief.</p> <p>Pollsters regularly say that the vice-presidential pick has almost no impact on a campaign. But this battle for the White House has repeatedly broken with precedent and Biden made an impact last night.</p> <p>He spent the opening part of his speech talking about his family and background in cloying and overly sentimental terms that Americans seem to like but which sound nauseating to Europeans. But his background too is an asset to Obama. Biden played up his working-class roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in the hope that this will sway voters seduced by Republican charges that Obama is elitist.</p> <p>And Biden showed at the convention a third reason why Obama chose him as his running mate. He is popular in the party, a force for the kind of unity on display last night. The delegates like the way he rose from a working-class background, faced personal tragedy along the way - he lost his first wife a child in a car accident - and established himself as an authoritative voice on foreign affairs.</p> <p>There are downsides to him too. He has lots of experience of Congress but none of the White House. His off-the-cuff comments are risky, with the potential for gaffes. And, in spite of his working-class background and supposed campaigning ability, his showing in the primaries was poor.</p> <p>McCain has made his choice as vice-presidential running mate, though not yet announced it. It is possible that Biden may have altered McCain's choice. </p> <p>The two vice-presidential candidates will go head-to-head in a debate in St Louis on October 2. Normally these do not matter much but Biden is a good debater, with a sense of humour as well as his expertise in foreign affairs. McCain may feel he needs to find someone with equivalent gravitas.</p>",
  "<p>Finally on night three, Bill Clinton and Joe Biden show the Democrats mean business.</p> <p>Now that's what a convention is supposed to be like.</p> <p>After two desultory convenings that left the faithful a bit nervous about how this week was going to turn out, Wednesday night's edition of the Democratic convention started to give shape and force to this gathering. Bill Clinton gave not just a good speech for Barack Obama, but one of the finest speeches of his entire career. Joe Biden delivered the goods in a personal and partisan, but restrained and skillful, address that should persuade a lot of swing voters about what he adds to the ticket. Even John Kerry gave a great speech (how liberating it is sometimes to lose!). And the surprise appearance at the end of Biden's speech by the candidate himself was graceful and smooth, not a little clunky like his video appearance with the mishpuche on Monday night.</p> <p>Two things happened tonight that hadn't happened before tonight, two things that everyone I talked to in Denver - from other journalists to the woman on the 16th Street bus who asked me about it \u2013 had been desperately hoping would happen. First, testimonials - meaningful and believable testimonials - were made for Barack Obama's character. And second, the argument was made forcefully that John McCain, good man though he may be, would absolutely take the country in the wrong direction. The latter was done without casting gratuitous aspersions on him and was all the more effective for that, while the former was done with seriousness and care - nothing that was said about Obama tonight rang hollow or smelled of false braggadocio or messiah-ness. It was grounded, strong and credible.</p> <p>Bill Clinton: Good God. This was not just a good speech for Obama. This was one of the best speeches of Bill Clinton's career. Any memory of that churlish and childish Bill from New Hampshire and South Carolina is gone. He did all the things his wife, I felt, did not do. He said Obama is ready. He vouched for Obama's personal character. He compared Obama to himself! </p> <p>I was in the hall for Bill's speech. But the way these things go at such events, I didn't actually get into the seating area. By the time I arrived, which was theoretically plenty early enough, every section was already full. I watched the speech on a television monitor in the concourse with a gaggle of reporters and supporters. And I could see that as he went along, the people watching the monitor with me became more and more rapt. Someone dashed by to deliver the copies of the prepared text. When he finished, even the concessions staff were applauding.</p> <p>I can't convey in these few hundred words how brilliant Clinton's speech was. Let me just say that every sentence flowed perfectly from the one preceding it and that he was in masterful control of the text. Best single line to me: \"People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power.\" But quoting that line out of context tells you nothing. It was part of a testimonial to Obama's judgment that no speaker at this convention had yet delivered and that every attendee yearned for.</p> <p>Biden also gave a fine, fine speech. He suffered only because he followed Bill, but he also vouched for Obama's character and testified that this \"exotic\" bird is really a normal man. Part of the draw with Biden was his working-class, industrial roots, and he drew on them and convincingly related them to Obama's upbringing. Second, he took on McCain with vigor and, again, credibility, given his many years in the Senate. </p> <p>Most importantly - and this might prove to be well worth remembering - he attacked McCain on foreign policy, and hard. McCain is the type of figure about whom Democrats would normally say, \"He's too tough and experienced, we can't go after him, let's change the subject to health care.\" But Biden tore into the insanity of the McCain worldview on a range of fronts - on al-Qaida, Iran and Iraq, Biden said: \"John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\" This is a central theme the Democrats have to hit without seeming to retreat behind the corner as they say it. Biden did it.</p> <p>It had been a very, very mopey Wednesday. People were starting to panic about whether this convention would be a failure. I got that feeling from a handful of conversations and a phalanx of emails. </p> <p>I haven't had the same post-Clinton and Biden interactions yet, but I'm pretty confident that when I talk with people Thursday morning, they're not going to feel very mopey at all. Quite the contrary. It's teed up now for the nominee to do his thing. It feels now like a convention, And a fight.</p>",
  "<p>Beau, I love you. I am so proud of you. Proud of the son you are. Proud of the father you've become. And I'm so proud of my son Hunter, my daughter Ashley, and my wife Jill, the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time.</p> <p>It is an honour to share this stage tonight with President Clinton. And last night, it was moving to watch Hillary, one of the great leaders of our party, a woman who has made history and will continue to make history: my colleague and my friend, Senator Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>And I am honoured to represent our first state\u2014my state\u2014Delaware.</p> <p>Since I've never been called a man of few words, let me say this as simply as I can: Yes. Yes, I accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next President of the United States of America, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Let me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honouring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our Constitution, no longer will the eight most dreaded words in the English language be: \"The vice president's office is on the phone.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama and I took very different journeys to this destination, but we share a common story. Mine began in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and then Wilmington, Delaware. With a dad who fell on hard economic times, but who always told me: \"Champ, when you get knocked down, get up. Get up.\"</p> <p>I wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children\u2014all the children who flocked to our house\u2014that you are defined by your sense of honour, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.</p> <p>Failure at some point in everyone's life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn't get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day.</p> <p>After the accident, she told me, \"Joey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.\" And when I triumphed, she was quick to remind me it was because of others.</p> <p>My mother's creed is the American creed: No one is better than you. You are everyone's equal, and everyone is equal to you.</p> <p>My parents taught us to live our faith, and treasure our family. We learned the dignity of work, and we were told that anyone can make it if they try.</p> <p>That was America's promise. For those of us who grew up in middle-class neighbourhoods like Scranton and Wilmington, that was the American dream and we knew it.</p> <p>But today that American dream feels as if it's slowly slipping away. I don't need to tell you that. You feel it every single day in your own lives.</p> <p>I've never seen a time when Washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up. Almost every night, I take the train home to Wilmington, sometimes very late. As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed.</p> <p>Like millions of Americans, they're asking questions as profound as they are ordinary. Questions they never thought they would have to ask:</p> <p> - Should mom move in with us now that dad is gone?<br> - Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars to fill up the car?<br> - Winter's coming. How we gonna pay the heating bills?<br> - Another year and no raise?<br> - Did you hear the company may be cutting our healthcare?<br> - Now, we owe more on the house than it's worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?<br> - How are we gonna be able to retire?</p> <p>That's the America that George Bush has left us, and that's the future John McCain will give us. These are not isolated discussions among families down on their luck. These are common stories among middle-class people who worked hard and played by the rules on the promise that their tomorrows would be better than their yesterdays.</p> <p>That promise is the bedrock of America. It defines who we are as a people. And now it's in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn't get it.</p> <p>Barack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.</p> <p>You know, I believe the measure of a man isn't just the road he's travelled; it's the choices he's made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that's not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighbourhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone.</p> <p>And he made their lives the work of his life. That's what you do when you've been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That's how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a pay cheque. It's dignity. It's respect. It's about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we're going to be ok.</p> <p>Because Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have healthcare in Illinois. He fought to make that happen. And because Barack made that choice, working families in Illinois pay less taxes and more people have moved from welfare to the dignity of work. He got it done.</p> <p>And when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. He reached across party lines to pass a law that helps keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. And he moved Congress and the president to give our wounded veterans the care and dignity they deserve.</p> <p>You can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him, debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure. You learn about the strength of his mind, but even more importantly, you learn about the quality of his heart.</p> <p>I watched how he touched people, how he inspired them, and I realized he has tapped into the oldest American belief of all: We don't have to accept a situation we cannot bear.</p> <p>We have the power to change it. That's Barack Obama, and that's what he will do for this country. He'll change it.</p> <p>John McCain is my friend. We've known each other for three decades. We've travelled the world together. It's a friendship that goes beyond politics. And the personal courage and heroism John demonstrated still amaze me.</p> <p>But I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country. For example,</p> <p>John thinks that during the Bush years \"we've made great progress economically.\" I think it's been abysmal.</p> <p>And in the Senate, John sided with President Bush 95 percent of the time. Give me a break. When John McCain proposes $200bn in new tax breaks for corporate America, $1bn alone for just eight of the largest companies, but no relief for 100m American families, that's not change; that's more of the same.</p> <p>Even today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history\u2014a half trillion dollars in the last five years\u2014he wants to give them another $4bn in tax breaks. But he voted time and again against incentives for renewable energy: solar, wind, bio-fuels. That's not change; that's more of the same.</p> <p>Millions of jobs have left our shores, yet John continues to support tax breaks for corporations that send them there. That's not change; that's more of the same.</p> <p>He voted 19 times against raising the minimum wage. For people who are struggling just to get to the next day, that's not change; that's more of the same.</p> <p>And when he says he will continue to spend $10bn a month in Iraq when Iraq is sitting on a surplus of nearly $80bn, that's not change; that's more of the same.</p> <p>The choice in this election is clear. These times require more than a good soldier; they require a wise leader, a leader who can deliver change\u2014the change everybody knows we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama will deliver that change. Barack Obama will reform our tax code. He'll cut taxes for 95% of the American people who draw a pay cheque. That's the change we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama will transform our economy by making alternative energy a genuine national priority, creating 5m new jobs and finally freeing us from the grip of foreign oil. That's the change we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama knows that any country that out teaches us today will out-compete us tomorrow. He'll invest in the next generation of teachers. He'll make college more affordable. That's the change we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama will bring down healthcare costs by $2,500 for the typical family, and, at long last, deliver affordable, accessible healthcare for all Americans. That's the change we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama will put more cops on the streets, put the \"security\" back in Social Security and never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That's the change we need.</p> <p>As we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.</p> <p>In recent days, we've once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia's challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia. Barack Obama and I will end this neglect. We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we'll help the people of Georgia rebuild.</p> <p>I've been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration's policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this.</p> <p>Now, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn't ready to protect our national security. Now, let me ask you: whose judgment should we trust? Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he said only three years ago, \"Afghanistan\u2014we don't read about it anymore because it's succeeded\"? Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?</p> <p>The fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban\u2014the people who actually attacked us on 9/11\u2014have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack's call for more troops.</p> <p>John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.</p> <p>Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change.</p> <p>Now, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that's the best way to advance our security. </p> <p>Again, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.</p> <p>Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq\u2014that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?</p> <p>Now, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.</p> <p>John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.</p> <p>Again and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.</p> <p>Folks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they'll look to us again, they'll trust us again, and we'll be able to lead again.</p> <p>Jill and I are truly honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey. When I look at their young children\u2014and when I look at my grandchildren\u2014I realize why I'm here. I'm here for their future.</p> <p>And I am here for everyone I grew up with in Scranton and Wilmington. I am here for the cops and firefighters, the teachers and assembly line workers\u2014the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the American dream endures.</p> <p>Our greatest presidents\u2014from Abraham Lincoln to Franklin Roosevelt to John Kennedy\u2014they all challenged us to embrace change. Now, it's our responsibility to meet that challenge.</p> <p>Millions of Americans have been knocked down. And this is the time as Americans, together, we get back up. Our people are too good, our debt to our parents and grandparents too great, our obligation to our children is too sacred.</p> <p>These are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I'm ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America's time.</p> <p>May God bless America and protect our troops.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337018564\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>I am honoured to be here tonight to support Barack Obama. And to warm up the crowd for Joe Biden, though as you'll soon see, he doesn't need any help from me. I love Joe Biden, and America will too.</p> <p>What a year we Democrats have had. The primary began with an all-star line-up and came down to two remarkable Americans locked in a hard fought contest to the very end. The campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming. </p> <p>In the end, my candidate didn't win. But I'm very proud of the campaign she ran: she never quit on the people she stood up for, on the changes she pushed for, on the future she wants for all our children. And I'm grateful for the chance Chelsea and I had to tell Americans about the person we know and love.</p> <p>I'm not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of her magnificent address last night. But I'll do my best.</p> <p>Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she'll do everything she can to elect Barack Obama. </p> <p>That makes two of us.</p> <p>Actually that makes 18m of us - because, like Hillary, I want all of you who supported her to vote for Barack Obama in November.</p> <p>Here's why.</p> <p>Our nation is in trouble on two fronts: The American dream is under siege at home, and America's leadership in the world has been weakened. </p> <p>Middle-class and low-income Americans are hurting, with incomes declining; job losses, poverty and inequality rising; mortgage foreclosures and credit card debt increasing; healthcare coverage disappearing; and a big spike in the cost of food, utilities and gasoline.</p> <p>Our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation; a perilous dependence on imported oil; a refusal to lead on global warming; a growing indebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders; a severely burdened military; a backsliding on global non-proliferation and arms control agreements; and a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy, from the Middle East to Africa to Latin America to Central and Eastern Europe.</p> <p>Clearly, the job of the next president is to rebuild the American dream and restore America's standing in the world.</p> <p>Everything I learned in my eight years as president and in the work I've done since, in America and across the globe, has convinced me that Barack Obama is the man for this job.</p> <p>He has a remarkable ability to inspire people, to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose. He has the intelligence and curiosity every successful President needs. His policies on the economy, taxes, healthcare and energy are far superior to the Republican alternatives. He has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges, and a firm commitment to repair our badly strained military. His family heritage and life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation and to restore our leadership in an ever more interdependent world. The long, hard primary tested and strengthened him. And in his first presidential decision, the selection of a running mate, he hit it out of the park. </p> <p>With Joe Biden's experience and wisdom, supporting Barack Obama's proven understanding, insight and good instincts, America will have the national security leadership we need.</p> <p>Barack Obama is ready to lead America and restore American leadership in the world. Ready to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Barack Obama is ready to be president of the United States.</p> <p>He will work for an America with more partners and fewer adversaries. He will rebuild our frayed alliances and revitalize the international institutions which help to share the costs of the world's problems and to leverage our power and influence. He will put us back in the forefront of the world's fight to reduce nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and to stop global warming. He will continue and enhance our nation's global leadership in an area in which I am deeply involved, the fight against AIDS, TB and malaria, including a renewal of the battle against HIV/AIDS here at home. He will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort. But in a world troubled by terror; by trafficking in weapons, drugs and people; by human rights abuses; by other threats to our security, our interests and our values, when he cannot convert adversaries into partners, he will stand up to them.</p> <p>Barack Obama also will not allow the world's problems to obscure its opportunities. Everywhere, in rich and poor countries alike, hardworking people need good jobs; secure, affordable healthcare, food and energy; quality education for their children; and economically beneficial ways to fight global warming. These challenges cry out for American ideas and American innovation. When Barack Obama unleashes them, America will save lives, win new allies, open new markets and create new jobs for our people. </p> <p>Most important, Barack Obama knows that America cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home. People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power. </p> <p>Look at the example the Republicans have set: American workers have given us consistently rising productivity. They've worked harder and produced more. What did they get in return? Declining wages, less than a quarter as many new jobs as in the previous eight years, smaller healthcare and pension benefits, rising poverty and the biggest increase in income inequality since the 1920s. American families by the millions are struggling with soaring healthcare costs and declining coverage. I will never forget the parents of children with autism and other severe conditions who told me on the campaign trail that they couldn't afford healthcare and couldn't qualify their kids for Medicaid unless they quit work or got a divorce. Are these the family values the Republicans are so proud of? What about the military families pushed to the breaking point by unprecedented multiple deployments? What about the assault on science and the defense of torture? What about the war on unions and the unlimited favors for the well connected? What about Katrina and cronyism?</p> <p>America can do better than that. And Barack Obama will. </p> <p>But first we have to elect him.</p> <p>The choice is clear. The Republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in Vietnam. He loves our country every bit as much as we all do. As a senator, he has shown his independence on several issues. But on the two great questions of this election, how to rebuild the American dream and how to restore America's leadership in the world, he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years, a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001, when the Republicans finally gained control of both the White House and Congress. Then we saw what would happen to America if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented.</p> <p>They took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt; from over 22m new jobs down to 5m; from an increase in working family incomes of $7,500 to a decline of more than $2,000; from almost 8m Americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 and a half million falling into poverty - and millions more losing their health insurance. </p> <p>Now, in spite of all the evidence, their candidate is promising more of the same: More tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that will swell the deficit, increase inequality and weaken the economy. More Band-aids for healthcare that will enrich insurance companies, impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured. More going it alone in the world, instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence.</p> <p>They actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more. Let's send them a message that will echo from the Rockies all across America: Thanks, but no thanks. In this case, the third time is not the charm.</p> <p>My fellow Democrats, 16 years ago, you gave me the profound honour to lead our party to victory and to lead our nation to a new era of peace and broadly shared prosperity. </p> <p>Together, we prevailed in a campaign in which the Republicans said I was too young and too inexperienced to be commander-in-chief. Sound familiar? It didn't work in 1992, because we were on the right side of history. And it won't work in 2008, because Barack Obama is on the right side of history. </p> <p>His life is a 21st-century incarnation of the American dream. His achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the \"more perfect union\" of our founders' dreams. The values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability, their chance to build a decent life, and to show our humanity, as well as our strength, to the world. </p> <p>We see that humanity, that strength, and our future in Barack and Michelle Obama and their beautiful children. We see them reinforced by the partnership with Joe Biden, his wife Jill, a dedicated teacher, and their family.</p> <p>Barack Obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope. If, like me, you still believe America must always be a place called Hope, then join Hillary, Chelsea and me in making senator Barack Obama the next president of the United States.</p>",
  "<p><strong>DENVER</strong> \u2014 One of the big questions surrounding Joe Biden's speech, which I'll be liveblogging here in a few minutes, is how much of it he's going to spend attacking John McCain and George Bush. Barack Obama has to take a conciliatory tone on the podium - because he's preaching a message of post-partisanship, and because he is black - and so Biden's role in the campaign is likely to be that of the attacker. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess28-2008aug28,0,2277714.story\">If Biden goes too far</a>, though, he threatens to disrupt the conciliation-and-unity theme that Team Obama have been so vigorously promoting. He also has to convey his years of experience (again, without making Obama look bad by comparison) and to establish the sense that convention and the campaign from here on in is about Obama/Biden \u2014 that the Clinton Catharsis is over and done with. Nobody would choose to follow Bill Clinton on the podium, but Biden's a speaker who might well manage it. Then again, he might also talk for far too long, or shoot his mouth off in a spectacular fashion. Check back soon ...<br></p> <p><strong>8.20pm</strong> Biden's name is being presented to the delegates for nomination. He just won the nomination! Stunning.</p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong> Video tribute time. Joe Biden is God, essentially. A Neil Kinnock-plagiarising God, but God nonetheless.</p> <p><strong>8.23pm:</strong> Here's Biden's son, Beau Biden, who is Delaware's attorney-general. He's remembering the car crash in which Joe Biden's first wife and their infant daughter were killed. We also learn that Joe had a \"severe stutter\" as a child - but he'd got rid of it by the time he called Slobodan Milosevic \"a war criminal to his face\". Beau is also plugging his own forthcoming military service, ever so subtly, and asking the delegates to \"be there\" for his father instead. \"Please join me in welcoming my friend, my father, my hero, the next vice-president of the United States, Joe Biden.\" At least he didn't say \"president\", like Obama did the other day.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm:</strong> Biden walks on to some particularly un-exciting music, and says thank you a not inconsiderable number of times. He has very good teeth, unlike the British. </p> <p><strong>8.35pm:</strong> He's very, very proud of his son. And he loves his wife, \"the only one who leaves me both breathless and speechless at the same time.\" What on earth does that even mean...? </p> <p>Now he's praising Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>\"Let me make this pledge to you right here and now. For every American who is trying to do the right thing, for all those people in government who are honoring their pledge to uphold the law and respect our constitution, no longer will the most dreaded words in the English language be: 'The vice-president's office is on the phone.'\" There you go: a Biden joke. Savour it, because he will banned from making any others for the rest of the campaign.</p> <p><strong>8.37pm:</strong> His dad used to call him Champ, apparently.</p> <p><strong>8.40pm:</strong> As for his mother, \"when I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded I bloody their nose so I could walk down the street the next day.\" I think that was the foreign policy part of the speech.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm:</strong> Americans are asking themselves questions. \"Should mom move in with us now that Dad is gone?\" \"How are we gonna be able to retire?\" \"That's the America that George Bush has left us, and that's the future George - I mean John - McCain will give us. Freudian slip! Freudian slip!\" Yeah, right...</p> <p>\"John McCain doesn't get it. Barack Obama gets it.\" And now a long passage in praise of Obama's earlier work in the neighbourhoods of Chicago. \"He made their lives the work of his life. That's what you do when you've been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That's how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It's dignity. It's respect.\"</p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong> Another top Democrat refers to John McCain as his friend! \"I know you hear that phrase used all the time in politics, but I mean it. We've travelled the world together.\" That must have been one extraordinary summer. \"But I profoundly disagree with the direction that John wants to take the country.\"</p> <p>\"Even today, as oil companies post the biggest profits in history ... John wants to give them another $4bn in tax breaks.\" This is an interesting strategy: a long litany of attacks on McCain, but Biden is scrupulous in calling him \"John\" every time. Respectful, or actually the opposite?</p> <p>We're told Barack Obama will transform the economy, cutting taxes for 95% of Americans who draw a paycheck, bring healthcare costs down by $2,500 for the average family, \"deliver affordable, accessible healthcare for all Americans ... [and] will never give up until we achieve equal pay for women. That's the change we need.\" A pretty straightforward attempt to reach the out-of-pocket swing-state voters whom Biden needs to bring on board.</p> <p><strong>8.54pm:</strong> Foreign policy, now. An attack on \"the Bush-McCain foreign policy,\" which has been an \"abysmal failure\"... \"Well, let me ask you this. Should you trust the judgment of John McCain, when he said only three years ago, \"Afghanistan - we don't read about it anymore because it's succeeded?... John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\" </p> <p>On talking to Iran... \"Again and again, John McCain has been wrong, and Barack Obama was right.\"</p> <p>On Iraq withdrawal... \"John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.\"</p> <p>Some \"friend,\" this John McCain...</p> <p>\"Again and again and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right. Folks, remember when the world used to trust us? When they looked to us for leadership? With Barack Obama as our president, they'll look to us again, they'll trust us again, and we'll be able to lead again.\"</p> <p><strong>8.55pm:</strong> \"These are extraordinary times. This is an extraordinary election. The American people are ready. I'm ready. Barack Obama is ready. This is his time. This is our time. This is America's time. May God bless America and protect our troops.\" </p> <p>Much applause. Bruce Springsteen on the PA.</p> <p><strong>8.57pm:</strong> And now a surprise guest! WHO COULD IT BE?</p> <p>Yeah, it's Barack Obama. You might remember him. \"Hello, Democrats,\" he says, addressing the convention for the first time. \"I just wanted to come out here for a little something to say.\" He's proud of Joe Biden. </p> <p>As to the convention so far: \"I think Michelle Obama kicked it off pretty well, don't you think? If I'm not mistaken, Hillary Clinton rocked the house last night. And ... president Bill Clinton reminded us of what it's like when you've got a president who actually puts people first. Thank you, President Clinton.\" Can you feel the unity tonight?</p> <p>Conclusion: a good speech - not as audience-rousing as I'd thought it<br>might be, but pressing all the right buttons on foreign policy and the<br>economy, and making it clear that this campaign's conciliatory message<br>doesn't mean John McCain isn't going to get attacked lots. A little<br>overshadowed by Mr Obama's last-minute appearance, but that can't<br>exactly be helped at this convention, can it? Now the podium is<br>filling up with Joe Biden's entire extended family, to the tune of We<br>Are Family. Which is nice.</p> <p>See you tomorrow, when it seems pretty certain that \"rousing\" will be<br>in plentiful supply.</p>",
  "<p><em>I've bought a new HD video camera which records in AVCHD. When I looked at the Pinnacle editing software supplied with it, I read that the minimum requirements include an Intel quad core processor running at 2.66GHz. I have consulted PC World, Dell and HP, and none has a home computer running at this speed. What can I do?</em> <strong>Richard Cooke</strong></p> <p>AVCHD is one of the high-definition movie standards used by Blu-ray and HD DVD and allows for pictures that are 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. It is a highly compressed format, to save space, but as a consequence it requires a great deal of processing power to reconstruct the original image. What the camera salesmen don't tell you is that just displaying 25 of these large images a second is beyond many PCs, unless they have accelerated graphics. Editing them can be a nightmare, and a common approach (taken by Apple's Final Cut Pro, among others) is to transcode them into something that is easier to handle. The Wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVCHD\">AVCHD</a> lists some of these converters.</p> <p>Editing native AVCHD is not, of course, beyond reach. However, such powerful PCs are generally not off-the-shelf items, but assembled to order. First, pick your Intel Core 2 Quad processor from <a href=\"http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2quad/specifications.htm\">Intel's spec sheet</a>: the Q6700 is the cheap 2.66GHz chip, but there's a newer, better 2.83GHz version, the Q9550. Next, look for a PC with that Q number, 4GB or 8GB of memory, and 64-bit Windows Vista. An example is the <a href=\"http://www.meshcomputers.com/Default.aspx?PAGE=PRODUCTVIEWPAGE&amp;USG=PRODUCT&amp;ENT=PRODUCT&amp;KEY=359130&amp;APPS=351520,234455\">Mesh Xtreme X9550GTX</a> with a Q9550, 8GB of memory, a terabyte of hard drive space, Blu-ray player and 24 inch widescreen monitor displaying 1,920 x 1,200 for \u00a31,199 inc VAT*.</p> <p>On its own, Pinnacle Studio 12 will run OK on a 1.6 GHz Dual Core processor with 1GB of memory, so the problem is down to the videos you want to edit. You could reduce the PC hardware requirements by reducing the size of your videos. Instead of shooting 1,080p, for example, you could use 1,440 x 1,080 or go down to 720p (1,280 x 720 pixels), like broadcast HDTV. However, my experience is that editing MPeg-2 movies is a pig on a fast Pentium, and I'd expect editing MPeg-4 Part 10 (ie AVC) to be much piggier even on a quad core PC. I'd want more power, not less.</p> <p>* After I filed my copy, the price rose to \u00a31,299 and the 24 inch screen became a 26 inch screen.</p>"
