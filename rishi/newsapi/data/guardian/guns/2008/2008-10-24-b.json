  "<h2>Why do employers want to see references before my interviews?</h2> <p><strong>I'm applying for a number of jobs at the moment as I try to pursue a change of career. I have two line managers who have graciously agreed to act as referees for me. The usual procedure for references seems to be \"Is it OK to contact referees before interview?\" and job offers are made \"subject to references\". </strong></p> <p><strong>All perfectly sensible. However, I have completed two application forms recently \u2014 one for a government agency, the other for a local further education college \u2014 which have baldly stated that \"references may be taken up prior to an interview\" without giving me any say in the matter. </strong></p> <p><strong>I object to this and feel strongly that my referees should only be approached in the event of an offer of employment being made. What a waste of time or an employer to ask for 16 referees if they have eight candidates to interview instead of just two for the person they decide to appoint. </strong></p> <p><strong>I also believe that interviews are not just a chance for a potential employer to find out more about me but for me to find out whether I would like to work for them. If my referees were approached each time I had an interview, they could end up having to fill out a lot of forms. </strong></p> <p><strong>Am I over-reacting to this? Is there any point in my asking (diplomatically!) for referees to be contacted only in the event of an offer of employment? Or is that simply a way of ensuring that my application hits the rejects' pile without anyone even looking at my skills or experience? </strong> </p> <p>You do seem to have built up quite a head of steam about this. Has something else got under your skin recently? There's a strong undercurrent of \"And another thing!\" about your letter. Capital letters even. Michael Winner might have some advice for you. </p> <p>It seems to me extremely improbable that either of these potential employers would write off to the referees of every candidate before inviting them for interview. They're just establishing their freedom to do so. </p> <p>Overly bureaucratic, perhaps, and not very sensitive; but no cause for outrage, surely? There may well be the occasional application that, though extremely promising in almost every respect, leaves room for some specific doubt. </p> <p>It seems to me entirely reasonable for a reference to be checked before an interview is granted; it could save both parties time and trouble. So however diplomatically you do it, I'd strongly advise against insisting on being released from this condition. At worst you could sound as if you'd something to hide and at best you'd come across as petty-minded. I agree with you that interviews should have a mutual value; it's at least as important for the potential employee to evaluate the potential employer as the other way found. But unless you feel your references will be unflattering \u2014 which you clearly don't \u2014 then tacitly agreeing to this mildly irritating request isn't going to do you out of anything. </p> <h2>I'm new to the UK but have struggled to find a teaching job</h2> <p><strong>I have recently settled in the UK with my wife and daughter (who are both British). While overseas I completed my degree in physical education and sport. After graduating I found myself working as a project manager for an after-school programme for underprivileged children. Though very difficult at times, it was also very rewarding and it made me feel like I was doing something meaningful. </strong></p> <p><strong>I studied physical education because I am passionate about sports. Ideally I would like to be part of a sports organisation but I am not sure in what capacity. I just know I am sports-obsessed. But my problem goes beyond that. Now, in England, I have applied for many jobs that were related to sports but have not been given any interviews. I then decided \u2014 reluctantly \u2014 to go to education agencies since I thought that as a qualified teacher I will be able to find something. But this too has proven hard to get. My certificates are all translated into English but they are perplexing to potential recruiters.<br> I am now looking to work at anything since we are beginning to struggle financially. But even simple jobs, like warehouse positions, now require reference checks and police checks \u2014 which is reasonable but takes a long time, and many companies prefer not to go through the hassle of doing overseas checks. </strong></p> <p><strong>I'm worried that I have gotten to the point where I have to work at anything, but at the same time I wonder if I will be able to get out of that cycle of working at odd jobs since these kind of jobs will not contribute to my desire to do something meaningful. Though fluent in English, it is still not my first language and I feel like I don't know how to convey what I did back home to <br>potential recruiters. </strong></p> <p>The one thing you fail to mention could be the one thing you should be concentrating on: and that's your first language. Perverse though it may seem, the background that may be working against you in 99 out of 100 job opportunities could make you extremely desirable for the remaining one. And you only need one. Because I don't know the name of your native country, I don't know the size of its community in Britain. But if you haven't already done so, you need to plug into it immediately. For someone in your situation, being a member of an informal network can be hugely helpful \u2014 not just in coming up with possible job opportunities but just as importantly as a source of moral support and encouragement.</p> <p>It's clear that your confidence is fading fast \u2014 and the company of sympathetic compatriots could help a lot. Somewhere out there will be a job \u2014 and a challenging and rewarding job at that \u2014 where your native language will be seen as a rare and positive asset. No one will be daunted by those translated certificates. It's probably too much to hope that such a job will also involve sport \u2014 but you may have to postpone that dream for a bit. </p> <p>Once you've had one good job under your belt in this country, finding the next will be a great deal easier. </p> <p>For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <br><a href=\"http://work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p>Perhaps Rob Styles needs a break from football. Maybe football needs a break from Rob Styles. Or he could be just another of those referees who are fated to be dogged by controversy.</p> <p>It happens. Norman Burtenshaw was a reasonably competent ref who during his 11 years on the Football League list managed to get himself knocked out by Millwall fans, responded to a clampdown on fouls by immediately sending off George Best and was attacked by the entire Benfica team during a pre-season friendly at Arsenal.</p> <p>It is Styles's misfortune to be refereeing in the age of the instant playback which makes everyone an expert with hindsight. His decision on Monday to send off Newcastle's Habib Beye and award Manchester City a penalty at St James' Park, ruling that the defender had brought down Robinho and denied the Brazilian a scoring opportunity, was subjected to even more intense scrutiny in view of Styles's previous record in similar circumstances.</p> <p>Even before the Football Association rescinded Beye's red card on Thursday the file on Styles was beginning to bulge. Early last season he gave Chelsea a penalty at Anfield after Florent Malouda had merely stumbled into Liverpool's Steve Finnan. \"It was an invisible penalty,\" declared Rafael Ben\u00edtez, the bemused Liverpool manager. Last March Styles awarded Birmingham a penalty after their own Gary McSheffrey had shoulder-charged Manchester City's Sun Jihai. The normally reserved Sven-Goran Eriksson, then City's manager, was moved to remark that: \"I've never seen anything like it.\"</p> <p>At Old Trafford last month Styles surpassed himself when Bolton's Jlloyd Samuel dispossessed Cristiano Ronaldo with a flawless sliding tackle only to discover that he, too, had given away a penalty. Gary Megson, the Bolton manager, thought Styles was going to book Ronaldo for diving, which would also have been unjust. Megson described the penalty as \"a nonsense decision\" and two days later Styles agreed, apologising for his error.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson, unusually magnanimous, felt the referee had shown commendable character and humility and deserved much credit for saying sorry. After all Manchester United had won the game. Nevertheless the climbdown probably spared Styles an idle weekend. Keith Hackett, the refs' boss, could have suspended him but instead sent him to Tottenham, possibly as a reminder that, however hard life might seem, there is always someone worse off. The commendable tome Hackett's Law lists \"The Five Cs of Refereeing\": control, communication, courage, consistency and commonsense. In Styles's case a sixth C-word comes to mind. Contrition, what else?</p> <p>Television replays from several angles suggested that Monday's penalty at Newcastle and the subsequent red card was a bad call because in tackling Robinho from behind, Beye had taken enough of the ball before the forward fell over his outstretched leg. Later in the match Nicky Butt dispossessed Robinho in similar fashion and again the Brazilian went to ground but Butt was not penalised by Styles who had probably seen the tackle from a better angle. His earlier decision to punish Beye was based on a long-distance view from directly behind the players involved. He saw the tackle go in and Robinho go down but apparently did not spot how much the defender had got on the ball.</p> <p>Controversies of this kind were bound to multiply once the game's authorities had decided that players guilty of fouls in the penalty area could be sent off if a scoring chance had been prevented. This meant that the victims of a bad decision faced the double whammy of unjustly losing a man as well.</p> <p>Yet it should not be forgotten that in becoming stricter with tackles from behind, the game has gone a long way towards ridding itself of the sort of challenges which for decades set British football apart from the rest of the world. By the early Seventies, in England, a skilful player could not turn with the ball for fear of being hacked down by an opponent coming in from behind or the side. At the same time referees should still be allowed to decide when a challenge from behind has been fair even if, almost inevitably, there is contact with the opponent.</p> <p>In the meantime those who have lambasted Styles should remember that at least British refs make honest mistakes, in which respect they are a bit like Humbert Wolfe's view of the press: You cannot hope to bribe or twist, thank God, the British journalist. But seeing what the man will do unbribed there's no occasion to.</p>",
  "<p>Emory Douglas doesn't look like your typical FBI target. The 65-yearold father of three has a pleasant, early retiree's way about him. Yet, before him sits a pile of A4 sheets - all US government documents, proving that, indeed, The Man had his eye on Emory.</p> <p>\"I got these under the Freedom of Information,\" says the artist, sitting in Manchester's Urbis gallery, where he's preparing his first European show. \"We knew they were wire tapping, following us, making trips to our work; they looked up our bank details.\"</p> <p>The \"we\" is the Black Panther Party, in whose cadres Emory served as minister of culture and revolutionary artist from 1967 until its dissolution in the early-80s. Though not a founding member, Emory first met Bobby Seale and Huey Newton three months after they had established the party, in January 1967.</p> <p>\"Huey and Bobby were highly intellectual,\" he remembers, \"I was naive to all that, but I wanted to make change.\" Having served time in a youth detention centre Emory, the son of blind single mother, had a deep distrust of authority but also possessed some visual arts training. So the Panthers put him in charge of their newspaper and a ministerial position followed soon after.</p> <p>Douglas's role involved communicating the party's message to a community with low literacy rates and little experience of formal politics. He illustrated and laid out the Black Panther newspaper, drawing images of empowered black folk, as well as representations of their oppressors, The Pig, an animal which stood for everyone from the local police to the president. </p> <p>His work was pasted up around the black community and his posters were distributed internationally by the Cuban political group, OSPAAAL. </p> <p>Emory says the party's golden years were from 1967 until 1974 or so. \"We were at our most powerful then,\" he says, \"doing our survival programmes: we had free breakfast programmes, free healthcare programmes, buses to prisons programmes, free clothes giveaways; we ran schools.\"</p> <p>Yet, with so many pictures calling for blacks to shoot back at the cops, it shouldn't have come as a surprise that America's investigative agencies took an interest in Emory and co. The artist recalls one day during the early 1970s, when he took a call from an \"art dealer\".</p> <p>\"He suggested I came to meet them at a hotel,\" he says, \"he was going to make me rich.\" Emory declined, so the dealer rang back, on an unlisted number, at one of the Panthers' properties. With his suspicions aroused, Emory demurred once more, and still believes that had he met with the caller, things might have worked out differently for him.</p> <p>\"We were aware of the kinds of things that had been going on with black politicians,\" he says. \"They'd [the FBI] get them in a room and compromise them with cocaine and all that kind of stuff .\" Whatever the Bureau couldn't do to the Panthers, Emory believes, was done later, by other social forces.</p> <p>\"Politics changed in America,\" he says, \"they [the government] were allowing the crack cocaine into the community; they'd rather have that than have revolutionaries.\"</p> <p>Though he continued to produce art, up until last year Douglas had worked for two decades as the pre-press manager for his local newspaper, the Sun Reporter. It was only in 2007, with the publication of a large-format art book and an accompanying retrospective at MOCA in Los Angeles, that Emory began to receive the attention he deserved. He's proud of his work and the Panthers' achievements, but says there's plenty to be done.</p> <p>\"You still have high rates of unemployment; 60% of those who go to prison are blacks,\" he says. \"Black guys who sell the crack cocaine get more time than the white men who come and buy it; there's a disparity in the system.\"</p> <p>He acknowledges that a certain nostalgia surrounds radicalism (\"People buy Che Guevera T-shirts who don't know who Che is\"), yet he still signs a copy of his book with the inscription \"The Struggle Continues\", arguing that, while the ideals remain, the circumstances have changed.</p> <p>\"People these days don't have to make the choices we made; that was the struggle that we made,\" he says. \"If you went out there now and demanded that change, you'd get killed. We caught them at a time when we knew the law, we did it within the law, and they didn't know how to deal with it. </p> <p>\"If people confronted the police now, as we did then,\" he reflects emphatically, \"they'd kill 'em.\" </p> <p>\u2022 Black Panther: Emory Douglas And The Art Of Revolution, opens Thu 30, Urbis, Manchester; <a href=\"http://www.urbis.org.uk\">urbis.org.uk</a></p> <h2>Emory Douglas's works</h2> <p><strong>Nixon and Hitler</strong> (1973) \"Nobody liked Nixon,\" says Douglas, \"he came into the black community, nobody would talk to him.\"</p> <p><strong>Freedom</strong> (1970) \"Huey P Newton's metaphor of the panther as an animal that defends itself to death.\"</p> <p><strong>Gerald Ford</strong> (1974) \"With the stock market listings, that shows you who pulls the strings.

  "<p><strong>Dear Fatty </strong>by Dawn French. 366pp, Century, \u00a318.99<br><strong>That's Another Story</strong> by Julie Walters. 287pp, Orion, \u00a318.99<br><strong>Past-it Notes</strong> by Maureen Lipman. 465pp, JR Books, \u00a318.99<br><strong>Jade: Catch a Falling Star</strong> by Jade Goody. 263pp, John Blake, \u00a318.99</p> <p>Dawn French takes time out from her own life story to offer some marital advice to Madonna: \"Please don't be takin' the raspberry and blackcurrant machine to bed with you both any more. It is a phone cum day-to-day personal organisar [sic] and interweb surfer and has no right place in the bedroom where the incomin' beeps would be disturbin' all the good lovin'.\" The Madonna letters, which are interspersed with more personal missives in this curious epistolary memoir, accumulate into a rap about the downsides of celebrity - the problems of ageing, of invaded privacy, of becoming vain and impetuously adopting children from other continents. In a letter to her father, who killed himself when she was 19 and therefore had no knowledge of her success, French is more direct: \"Fame is toxic. There are benefits, but even those are dangerous if you get too used to them.\"</p> <p>One of the dangerous benefits is being allowed to play fast and loose with the structure of your book without anyone telling you that a collection of comedy sketches doesn't add up to a memoir. But despite the changes of register and swoops into luvviedom that are no less cloying for being hammed up, there are moments here that shine with the genius for observational comedy for which Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders (the Fatty of the title) are famous. On teenage girls playing cold-shoulder with boys in a local cafe: \"The debrief after such prolonged, intense, mind-blowing, complex flirting was essential. We were over-intoxicated with arousal. Fit to burst. Nobody at Goodbodies had said a word. Excellent. What a trip. Phew. Let's do it again next Friday. Christ. Hope I'm not pregnant!\"</p> <p>The Dawn in this story is, of course, not strictly Dawn but Everygirl: the stylistic variety of her writing underlines the fact that she is leading us through a hall of mirrors, in which she can contort reality in any way she wishes. It's a rather clever way of saying that the last laugh is on us, the readers of celebrity autobiography, who look to it for unguarded confidences when in fact it is a branch of image management.</p> <p>Julie Walters also has her hope-I'm-not-pregnant anecdote, which involves believing that you could conceive by sitting in a married man's bathwater, \"so I always gave the bath a good rinse if my father had been in before me\". The Walters who emerges from That's Another Story is a mischievous Brummie whose childhood seems to belong to an earlier century, with its horse-drawn milkcart and its coal merchant looking like \"an amateur actor blacked up to play Othello\". Her socially ambitious mother rose from Cadbury's chocolate packer to post office clerk, while her father was a painter and decorator - a mere \"man in overalls\", according to the contemptuous Irish grandmother who descended on them for her last, incontinent years, taking root in an old chair that \"made a sound like a full sponge if you poked it with a finger or, God forbid, sat in it\". The main reason that she plays so many older women, Walters writes, \"is that somewhere I want to recreate and comprehend both the fun and the calamity that was caused by my grandmother's presence in our house for what was actually almost the whole of my childhood.\"</p> <p>The USP of Walters's memoir is this ability to call a spade a shovel while concluding that it was actually, all along, plated with silver. Elocution lessons at her convent primary school may have torturously underlined her social inferiority to the doctors' daughters around her, but it was the sadistic nun who administered them who first recognised the actress in her. \"I knew then that in her laughter and in the laughing faces of my classmates lay my salvation and the building blocks for my self-esteem.\"</p> <p>Release to a state grammar school was \"like getting into your own bed after weeks of sleeping on someone else's hard floor; people spoke as I did.\" Even now that she is an OBE living on a farm in Sussex, she cleaves to the habits of the telly-owning working-class: \"I am slightly ashamed to say that when my own daughter was born and I brought her home ... when the theme for Corrie came on she turned her little, week-old head around towards the television in what was obviously recognition.\"</p> <p>Maureen Lipman's tribal identity is not far off that of Beattie, the shrill Jewish grandmother she played in British Telecom ads: she's the brainy battleaxe, the homebody with a whip for a tongue. There's a lot packed into her Past-it Notes, not least several years of newspaper and magazine columns and the best bits of six previous books. Judging by the type size, she doesn't consider much of her output to be second-best, but if you persevere, there's some touching new stuff about her attempts to come to terms with the vexations of age, and particularly the death of her beloved husband Jack Rosenthal. Like French and Walters, Lipman is a trouper, with all the fortune and fortitude that the word implies. \"The Fifties were all about 'front',\" she writes. \"Front gardens, front rooms and most of all putting up a good front. I was conditioned to be on the front line.\"</p> <p>Which brings me to the ugly duckling of this celebrity sisterhood - Jade Goody, whose fast-unravelling life is enshrined not only in the name but in the very structure of her ghosted autobiography, Catch a Falling Star. The discovery of her cervical cancer, which is now the main story, has been stuffed in as an afterword presumably because it happened after the book was written. In the 21st-century celebrity version of donning a hair shirt, our Jade resigns herself to cleaning the toilets on an Indian version of Big Brother hosted by Shilpa Shetty, with no apparent inkling of the social stigma involved. There's so little self-consciousness, so little image control, so little hope in this book that it's like watching a bullfight in which the bull thinks it's the matador and that the picadors are its friends. Just consider the following picture caption in the light of what we now know about Jade's medical condition: \"Out and about with one of my wigs on. I love wearing wigs. I just think it's great to be able to change your hairstyle any time you like.\" It's crueller than anything French and Saunders could concoct.</p>",
  "<h2>Francis Bacon - Study after Velazquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X (1953), Study for Portrait II (after the Life Mask of William Blake), (1955) Portrait of George Dyer in a Mirror (1968), Triptych May-June (1973), Francis Bacon's studio, preserved as left in 1992</h2> <p>Painting is something obscene and vicious, and utterly compelling, when Bacon wields the brush. His studio, preserved as a sealed room into which you peer anxiously as if you were looking into a poisonous snake's glassed box, is at once a monument to the solitude and mystery of creation and a scary claustrophobic nightmare in pink and purple and unshaded lightbulbs. His paintings are like that, too. Bacon found himself as a painter in the repressive aftermath of the second world war, with paintings that turn surrealism inside out and expose the mind's viscera. But it is the Old Masters, their rich cream surfaces and heavy frames on velvet wallpaper, with whom Bacon converses. His series of paintings of imprisoned, suffering, ridiculous popes meditate on Vela\u0301zquez's great ruddy-faced Pope Innocent X and on the tyranny of the portrait; there is an idea in Bacon of art as violence, as cruelty, and his eviscerated nudes are never the objects of sentimental compassion. His art can oppress in the mass but when you come across one of his paintings in some dull and predictable collection of postwar art it's like meeting the most horrible, fascinating old bastard in the club. <strong>Jonathan Jones</strong> </p> <h2>Giacomo Balla - Street Light (1909)</h2> <p>The massive yellow explosion of artificial light in Balla's Futurist Manifesto of a painting eradicates, as if switching on a light, all the chiaroscuro shadows of the old canvases that were smothering young Italians a century ago like shrouds. <strong>(JJ)</strong> </p> <h2>Balthus - Nude Playing with a Cat (1949)</h2> <p>Balthus may have been frowned upon for his artistic penchant for semi-clad adolescents, yet this is surely an empathetic image of uninhibited delight. The voluptuous abandon of both girl and cat, the beam of dawn sunlight, all transfixed in exquisite compositional tension. <strong>Robert Clark</strong></p> <h2>Aubrey Beardsley - Salome (1894)</h2> <p>Aubrey Beardsley's elegantly wasted figures and florid lettering, surrounded by exquisite detailing, were the most decadent images of the art nouveau movement. His highly sexualised and fevered illustrations for Oscar Wilde's play Salome scandalised Victorian society, and lost him his job at the Yellow Book literary periodical. <strong>Jessica Lack</strong></p> <h2>Max Beckmann - Departure (1932)</h2> <p>Before fleeing Nazi Germany, where his paintings were especially denounced as Degenerate Art, Beckmann conjured this tragic tableau of carnival gone terribly wrong. The seemingly inescapable foreground composition is an angulated nightmare. An ultramarine horizon beams with a faint ray of faraway hope. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Gentile Bellini (attributed) - Portrait of a Young Turkish Boy (1479-1480) </h2> <p>East and west meet in this delicate portrait, done by a Venetian at the Turkish court in Istanbul, that combines an Islamic sense of decorative surface with a Renaissance European focus on capturing the reality of the figure. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Giovanni Bellini - Agony in the Garden (c1465), Piet\u00e0 (c1468-1471), Doge Leonardo Loredan (1501-1505), The Feast of the Gods (finished by Titian) (1514-1529)</h2> <p>The most brilliant member of the painting dynasty that put Venice on the Renaissance map painted, among many delicate and unexpected masterpieces, the single most moving sunrise in art. It was his secret weapon in a painting competition with his own brother-in-law, Andrea Mantegna \u2014 who had married into the painting clan consisting of father Jacopo and his sons Giovanni and Gentile.</p> <p>In about 1460 Andrea painted a densely historical image of Christ praying in the garden before his arrest; it hangs today beside Giovanni's rivalrous version of the same subject. </p> <p>Giovanni wins outright, because behind his simple uncluttered depiction of Christ and the sleeping disciples is a vista of morning light breaking over the hills of northern Italy that simply stops you, holds you and makes you sigh.</p> <p>The pale white buildings of a Veneto hill town glow against a blue sky that is just starting to turn salmon pink. The hillsides below are still in nocturnal shadow. The image is rendered so beautifully that Giovanni must have been a man of disconcerting sensitivity. He pictures the dead Christ cradled by Mary not slumped over her knee but held up with his broad pale chest spread out like a handkerchief for the beholder to weep into. </p> <p>His portrait of Venice's elected ruler, in its stillness and quietness, is the male Mona Lisa. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Benin - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/oct/25/benin-art\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Berlin painter - Neck amphora decorated with an ageing reveller (c490BC) </h2> <p>The so-called \"Berlin painter\" of Athens was superb at marrying the composition of his designs to the form of the pot he was working on. His reveller, carrying a lyre, seems to lope nonchalantly along, graceful and balanced. <strong>Charlotte Higgins</strong></p> <h2>Gianlorenzo Bernini - The Rape of Proserpine (1621-1622), Apollo and Daphne (1622-1625), David (1623-1624), Bust of Scipione Borghese (1632), Bust of Costanza Bonarelli (c1636-1637), Triton Fountain 1642-1643), Ecstasy of St Theresa (1647-1652), Fountain of the Four Rivers (1648-1651), Bust of Louis XIV (1665), Blessed Ludovica Albertoni (1671-1674)</h2> <p>If one person could be said to have defined and perfected the baroque style, it was Gianlorenzo Bernini. Born in Naples, Bernini came to Rome around 1605 and caught the eye of an influential patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, for whom he created a series of mythological figures that represents the most significant advance in sculpture since the Renaissance. Bernini's chief innovation was to set marble in motion: whereas Donatello and Michelangelo had depicted the giant-killing David in monumental repose, Bernini catches him in the act of unleashing his sling, grimacing like a tennis player about to execute a ferocious backhand. Bernini captures the terror and poetry of the moment when the nymph Daphne becomes a laurel tree by showing leaves sprouting from her outstretched fingers; while his unparalleled ability to transform cold stone into warm blood can be seen as the god Pluto roughly sinks his fingers into the softness of Proserpine's thigh, leaving pressure indentations that made Bernini the first sculptor to depict cellulite. </p> <p>Bernini's baroque makeover of the Eternal City included the curved colonnade around the piazza at St Peter's, the dynamic parade of angels along the Sant'Angelo bridge, and many of Rome's monumental fountains, of which the Triton Fountain in Piazza Barberini and the Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona are the most iconic. Such structures were not intended merely to be ornamental \u2014 fountains formed a vital part of the city's water supply, while the personification of the great rivers from four continents (Nile, Danube, Ganges and Rio de la Plata) represented the Church's dominion over the known world.</p> <p>Bernini elevated the portrait bust to a new level of animation, creating sculptures that are not merely likenesses but psychological profiles \u2014 he <br>identified the most revealing moment to be the point just before a person speaks, and thus depicted his patron Cardinal Borghese with threads of saliva between his lips. His dynamic image of Louis XIV, hair flowing and lace flying as if caught in a strong wind, makes a flamboyant contrast to the dishevelled, apparently post-coital intimacy with which Bernini depicted his lover, Costanza Bonarelli.</p> <p>Yet for sheer unbridled sensuality, nothing matches Bernini's images of female saints in the throes of religious passion. The Chapel of the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni shows the charismatic saint clutching her breast, parting her lips and writhing in a manner that can only be described as orgasmic; while the Ecstasy of St Theresa in the Cornaro Chapel of Santa Maria della Vittoria is a piece of baroque theatre in which the swooning saint performs for onlookers in the donor family's box as if at some mystical, Counter-Reformation peep show. <strong>Alfred Hickling</strong></p> <h2>Joseph Beuys - Painroom (1941-1983), Burnt Door, Beak and Ears of a Hare (1953), Auschwitz Demonstration (1956-1964), Lightning with Stag in its Glare (1958-1985), Double Gouache (1959-1960), Chair with Fat (1963), Infiltration Homogeneous for Grand Piano (1966), Felt Suit (1970), The Hearth II (1978), The End of the Twentieth Century (1983-1985)</h2> <p>\"I am not a human being. I am a hare. I am a really horny hare!\" Joseph Beuys was the most influential artist of the latter half of the 20th century. <br>His work touches on concerns ranging from Holocaust guilt to ecological alarm. He was endlessly searching and reinventing, impossible to pin down by pre-Beuys definitions. His \"counter-images\" are often impenetrably hermetic, certainly enigmatic, yet always compelling. After all, anyone who could stand still performing on one leg for hours with a lump of lard shoved into the crook of his knee and keep a straight face has got to be either a screwball or a seer. One list of the contents of Beuys's studio includes a frankfurter painted with brown floor paint; a tin box filled with tallow, with a thermometer in it; toenail clippings; copper rods wrapped in felt. From such materials Beuys constructed sculptural installations and choreographed performances as attempts to exorcise the demons of \"the schizophrenia of our age\". He got stuck into an obsessive thing about felt, lead and fat. He was a contrary one: sweeping out a forest with a birch broom and bandaging a knife after cutting his finger. Then he could pick up a pencil and summon a drawing of a stag that is all a-quiver with wild life. And he delivered the most rousing lectures: \"The animals have sacrificed themselves to make humanity possible... Man must once more be in contact with those below, animals, plants, and nature, and those above, angels and spirits.\" <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Peter Blake - Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover (1967)</h2> <p>Peter Blake wanted to make the visual equivalent of pop music. Elvis, wrestlers, strippers and matchboxes all found their way into his colourful canvases. His artwork for the Beatles' Sgt Pepper album combined a cast of historical and contemporary celebrities; the result has been pored over almost as much as the album itself. <strong>(JL)</strong></p> <h2>William Blake - The Ancient of Days, from Europe: A Prophecy (1794), Jerusalem (1804-1820), The Ghost of a Flea (c1819-1920)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338930921\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/21/part1i.jpg\" alt=\"1000 artworks: William Blake, A Naked Man in Flames, plate 26 from 'Jerusalem'\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">William Blake, A Naked Man in Flames, plate 26 from 'Jerusalem'. Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blake's illuminated books are arguably Britain's greatest contribution to world art. Free from the empiricism that has made British painters excel at portraiture and landscape but so rarely at anything more freely imaginative, Blake created his own inner Sistine Chapel. This Southwark Michelangelo with no patron and little gift for drawing the nude mapped his own heroic universe with its own mythology \u2014 and amazingly Blake's bearded Ancient of Days merges with Michelangelo's God in your memory and mine. Blake proved long ago that ideas can be more crucial than skill. He will go on burning bright. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Umberto Boccioni - The City Rises (1910), Unique Forms of Continuity in Space (1913), Dynamism of a Speeding Horse and Houses (1914-1915)</h2> <p>When the poet FT Marinetti published the manifesto of futurism in 1909, announcing a new art movement that would blow away the cobwebs of old Europe, there wasn't actually any futurist art to illustrate it. That soon changed. Some of Italy's most talented painters joined the movement \u2014 including Boccioni. The great explosion of rearing horses in his epic canvas The City Rises is just the beginning of a radical artistic experiment in which Boccioni attempts to capture the essence of speed and power. His sculpture of a striding man tries quixotically to depict... what, exactly? The flames and flanges the strider gives off seem to represent energy leaving its trail in the ether. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Arnold Bocklin - Isle of the Dead (1880)</h2> <p>One of the most haunting landscapes ever, showing a rocky island, a dark sea and boat carrying what is probably a coffin. Perhaps because the artist couldn't exorcise the image from his mind, he painted several versions. The image's unforgettable presence lies less in its enigmatic symbolism than in the irresistible seductiveness of that sea and that sky. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Christian Boltanski - The Missing House (1990) </h2> <p>The Missing House powerfully explores remembrance and loss. An installation on the site of a bombed east Berlin apartment block in the Jewish quarter, it features plaques displaying former residents' names and jobs. This quiet, shocking memorial employs architectural absence to remember those lost through persecution or war. <strong>Elisabeth Mahoney</strong> </p> <h2>Pierre Bonnard - The Bath (1925), The Almond Tree in Blossom (1945-1947)</h2> <p>This is painting as an exercise in enchantment. Bonnard gazes so longingly that his perceived image, often painted away from the subject, glows to become something akin to Proustian memory. Scents, tastes and touches are evoked as much as sight. His forever pubescent wife soaking up a bathroom shimmer of Co\u0302te d'Azur sunlight. A blossom tree treasured like a totemic self-portrait. The seductiveness belies the artistic struggle, the years of intuitions and hesitancies, involved in its achievement. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Hieronymous Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights (1503-1504)</h2> <p>Pink fleshy structures prick against the sky as if grown from tongues, lips, labia in some mad geneticist's architectural experiment. Spotlights blaze through a smoke-filled night sky as if we are watching the firebombing of a wartime city... how did an obscure Flemish artist at the beginning of the 16th century concoct a fantasy that monstrously foreshadows and outdoes science fiction, surrealism, psychedelia? This religious work painted for an altar was purchased by Philip II, the melancholy Catholic pietist king who launched the Spanish Armada, so he must have seen something spiritual in it. And yet it reeks of heresy and madness. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Sandro Botticelli - Primavera (c1481-1482), Pallas and the Centaur (c1482), The Birth of Venus (c1484), Illustrations to Dante (c1480-1490), The Calumny of Apelles (c1495), Mystic Nativity (1500) </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338930922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/21/part1k.jpg\" alt=\"1000 artworks: Sandro Botticelli Primavera (c1481-1482)\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sandro Botticelli Primavera (c1481-1482). Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Botticelli is so clear and crisp. Totally uninterested in chiaroscuro or ambiguity or even the poetry of landscape, he has a harshness of line that makes him the perfect artist for the hardnosed merchants who funded the Florentine Renaissance \u2014 and yet, paradox of paradoxes, he is one of art's supreme mystics. </p> <p>His tough lucidity tricks the commonsense eye into accepting the occult. Slender arms and legs, polished leaves, a centaur's beard \u2014 all are visualised by Botticelli like pieces of imaginary sculpture held under the smooth surfaces of his pictures. And yet, nothing is real at all. The sea is too green to be wet, the women too beautiful to live, their dancing feet don't even touch the earth. Botticelli is so popular, so lovely \u2014 and yet if any artist could drive you mad with his conundrums, it would be him.</p> <p>Students of his great woodland arcadian dance, the Primavera, have if not gone mad then almost come to blows in their endless rival interpretations \u2014 is it a spiritual allegory, a magic talisman, a rite of spring? You can love this painting all your life and never know what it means. Botticelli's myths speak the secret language of a culture steeped in magic and philosophy. When he finally speaks directly to us, in an inscription in Greek above his Mystic Nativity, it is to prophesy a new heaven and a new earth. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Louise Bourgeois - Red Room (Parents) (1994), Red Room (Child) (1994)</h2> <p>Born in 1911, Louise Bourgeois is an artist of baffling versatility \u2014 she has worked in every medium from marble to bronze to drawing and embroidery \u2014 but with a profoundly individual, powerful voice. Her Red Rooms are coiling chambers enclosed in old panelled doors and contain objects such as a marital bed, a violin case, a toy train, and an oversize glass teardrop that seems about to drop on the bed. Like much of her work, Red Rooms trigger myriad associations about the family, about childhood, memory, sex \u2014 and not in a comforting way. <strong>(CH)</strong></p> <h2>Dirck Bouts - Hell (1470)</h2> <p>The damned bear witness with dark deathly eyes to their own sufferings as they are engorged by hell's serpents in this wing from a late medieval altarpiece. The emaciated nudity and macabre pallor lend the work a resemblance to some 19th century absinthe-drinker's decadent enfer. <strong>(JJ)</strong> </p> <h2>Mr Bower of Chesterfield - The Squirting Tree (original version 1695)</h2> <p>Once known as The Weeping Willow, but renamed by the future Queen Victoria, aged 13. Visiting Capability Brown's gardens at Chatsworth House, stumbling upon this crying copper sculpture makes one feel sad and glad to be around. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>Boyle Family - Rock and Scree Series (1977)</h2> <p>Mark and Joan Boyle started out producing light shows for gigs played by Soft Machine and Jimi Hendrix. But it was their mixed-media replications of patches of earth, randomly selected by throwing darts at an atlas, that really put the family on the map. <strong>(AH)</strong> </p> <h2>Constantin Brancusi - Brancusi's studio, reconstructed as it was left in 1957</h2> <p>Brancusi's beautiful abstract sculptures, polished, seductive, perfect, create a distant magic world of soaring bird gods and columns that climb heavenwardl ike some sky-ladder in a folk tale. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Georges Braque - Le Gu\u00e9ridon (1912), L'Atelier III (1949)</h2> <p>You can make out parts of a violin or cello, musical notes, the legs and round top of a table in Braque's cubist painting Le Gu\u00e9ridon, but these simple, almost cartoonlike sketchy elements melt away as soon as they are noticed, in a picture that is like a hesitant musical piece in the way it starts to find a theme and then becomes tentative again. Cubism is the most revolutionary art movement of the 20th century, a systematic repudiation of the idea that seeing is simple. Braque's still life is a series of feints in which he acknowledges the discontinuous and partial nature of perception. He pioneered cubism in close collaboration with Picasso but the partnership ended when he was wounded in the first world war. Only later in life did he once again produce masterpieces such as L'Atelier III. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Brassa\u00ef (Gyula Hal\u00e1sz) - Lovers in a Small Cafe near the Place d'Italie (1932)</h2> <p>The Hungarian-born photographer who stalked the rain-soaked streets of Paris after dark, Brassa\u00ef was an artist who fell in love with the louche, bohemian world of Montmartre in the 1930s, documenting the activities of nocturnal pleasure-seekers. Like these lovers, who circled the bright lights of the city's cafes like moths. <strong>(JL)</strong></p> <h2>Rodolphe Bresdin - The Good Samaritan (1861) </h2> <p>The Good Samaritan dismounts from his trusty camel and carries out his act of charity dead centre of the painting; but it's the imps hiding in obsessively delineated undergrowth who steal the show. It's said Bresdin was so in love with nature that he planted a mini landscape complete with waterfall in his Paris apartment, much to his neighbour's consternation. <strong>(RC)</strong></p> <h2>British (c3000BC-c1600BC) - Stonehenge</h2> <p>It might be a monstrous face looming in the mist, its grey skin flecked with green lichens. Gnarled recesses pockmark its twisted body. It is the Heel Stone just outside the outer earthwork of Britain's most unforgettable ancient monument. From a distance, the standing stones with their broken ring of lintels look like jagged teeth gnashing at the empty sky. Up close, their massive dark forms, blue and grey and scarred by organic parasites, are like ancestral spirits silently menacing the living world. Look carefully and you can make out dagger shapes carved into some of the upright stones. Watch the sky move over the circle, and it seems framed, controlled, by the imaginations of the ancient builders. A temple, a cemetery? Whatever it once was, today it endures as an sculptural marvel. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Agnolo Bronzino - Andrea Doria as Neptune (c1540-1550), Venus and Cupid (c1545)</h2> <p>As precious as a ruby on a white throat, Bronzino is the last genius of the Florentine Renaissance, the painter of corruption who saw the last days of the city's republic and who served the Medici \"tyrants\". His paintings breathe decadence. Venus and Cupid play their sensuous, in fact incestuous, games in a painting whose enigmatic allegory fails to disguise its irresponsibility. His portraits find character in strangeness. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (1555), The Tower of Babel (1563), The Procession to Calvary (1564), Hunters in the Snow (1565), The Gloomy Day (1565), The Return of the Herd (1565), The Massacre of the Innocents (c1567)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338931220\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/21/part1j.jpg\" alt=\"1000 artworks: Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Hunters in the Snow (1565)\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Hunters in the Snow (1565). Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridgeman Art Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An immense spiralling tower, its base as wide as a city, slowly crawls into the sky. From our bird's eye viewpoint we can see tiny people working on its unfinished hulk, on ramparts that circle the tapering cylinder. Anyone who has visited Rome will surely be reminded of the vast Flavian amphitheatre \u2014 the Colosseum \u2014 whose arched tiers seem to be imitated here, or rather turned inside out, the sloping substructure of internal seating thrown outward as Gothic buttresses.</p> <p>When Bruegel visited Rome from his native Flanders, another architectural marvel was going up that may have influenced his vision of hubris. The new St Peter's was already many decades into its construction, but did not yet have a dome. The building site begun in the early 1500s must have looked as chaotic and impossible as Bruegel's Tower of Babel.</p> <p>His painting of a monster building typifies the rich paradoxes that make him such a great artist. At once a sophisticated allusion to ancient Rome and a truly medieval image of sin and folly, it is simultaneously veristic and fabulous. Bruegel's fascination with details of work and engineering \u2014 his depiction of wooden cranes on the Tower or, in his Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, the ploughman in the foreground \u2014 makes it seem as though he follows homely Flemish tradition, yet his themes are historical and mythological. Is he a sophisticated pasticheur of popular culture or a naive mixer of high and low?</p> <p>In fact Bruegel is one of those human miracles unique to the Renaissance \u2014 the obvious comparison is Shakespeare \u2014 who straddle high and low art and whose epic vision is truly universal. <strong>(JJ)</strong></p> <h2>Buddhist art - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/oct/25/buddhist-art\">read more here</a></h2> <h2>Burmese (12th century) - Frescoes of the Abeyadana, Frescoes of the Wet-kyi-in, Ky-byauk-kyi</h2> <p>There are few examples of the brilliantly coloured Khmer-Thai-style temple frescoes left in Burma, many having been destroyed when the Mongols seized power in 1287.

The largest of the Bamiyan Buddhas stood 53m tall. The copper masks originally fitted to the stone giants glinted across the valley at awestruck pilgrims. These wonders of the Buddhist world have gone for ever but there are still pilgrimages to be made. Colossal Buddhas survive at Yungang and Longmen in China and Ajanta in India. Mural paintings in caves and monasteries, carvings from stupas, altarpieces and seated statues make Buddhism as potent a source of artistic creation as any of the world faiths.</p> <p>One of Buddhism's earliest artistic inventions was the stupa \u2014 a shrine in the form of a building that was not designed to be entered but to be beheld. The early Indian stupa evolved from Hindu burial mounds and took the form of a hemispheric dome surmounted by a column. The sculptures carved to decorate the great stupa at Amaravati between the first century BC and the third century AD are among Buddhist art's earliest treasures; their proliferation of narrative scenes strongly resembles Roman and Hellenistic art from the same period. They depict scenes from the life of the Buddha in his incarnation as Siddharta Gautama, a scion of north India's warrior class who rejected his comfortable life and became an ascetic for seven years, then a teacher who preached the ultimate goal of escaping the endless cycle of rebirth. </p> <p>The Buddha's iconic depiction, standing like the vanished Afghan giants, lying down or sitting cross-legged, is central to Buddhist art. Yet as the faith spread, it developed complex ideas and a pantheon of older deities were incorporated into esoteric variants. In Tibet, where Buddhism came late, savage mountain demons were adopted into monastic culture. Tibetan Buddhist sculptures and monastic paintings feature these ancient gods whose monstrous faces come from far back in the history of human life in the Himalayas. It was in China, however, that Buddhism inspired the most superb works of art. Here, too, the domed hemisphere of the Indian stupa was transfigured into the soaring tapering multi-roofed fantasia of the pagoda.</p> <h2>Key works</h2> <p>\u2022 Sculptures from the Great Stupa of Amaravati, India, now in British Museum (1st century BC to 3rd century AD)<br>\u2022 Sculpture of Yakshi or river goddess from Begram, Afghanistan, now in Kabul Museum (circa 1st century)<br>\u2022 Colossal Buddha carved into cliffs at Yungang, Shanxi province, China (c490)<br>\u2022 Parinirvana, reclining colossal figure in Cave 26 at Ajanta, India (late 5th century)<br>\u2022 Mural paintings in caves at Ajanta, India (5th century)<br>\u2022 Buddha Preaching the Law, painting on silk, from Cave 17, Dunhuang, China (early 8th century)<br>\u2022 Altarpiece in bronze inlaid with silver and copper from Sirpur, India, now in Los Angeles County Museum of Art (c800)<br>\u2022 Maitreya, standing figure from Nepal, now in Metropolitan Museum, New York (9th-10th centuries)<br>\u2022 Avalokiteshvara, painted wooden figure from China, now in Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City (12th-13th centuries)<br>\u2022 Monastery paintings of Tibet (10th century-present)<br>\u2022 Sarvabuddhadakini, painted clay sculpture from Tibet, now in British Museum (19th century)</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's new pussycat?</strong></p> <p>Well I've got a stand-up DVD coming out. It's quite extreme having a DVD of your naked stand-up, not that I'm naked in it but like stories from your youth, things that made you who you are today in the shops for people to buy. My main problem with it is people don't know who the hell I am. People know me as Murray from Flight Of The Conchords but secretly I'm much younger than he is and I wear jeans and trainers.</p> <p><strong>What becomes of the broken hearted?</strong></p> <p>I guess Murray's a bit of a broken-hearted character who's unsure of himself and hasn't had much success in his life until he meets a couple of cool-looking idiots. The important word there is idiots, because they're willing to follow Murray's advice. It's like the blind leading the blind. So it's a great deal for Murray because he gets to hang out with these two cool guys. And what do they get out of it? They get a father-protector type figure on the streets of New York.</p> <p><strong>Are you being served?</strong></p> <p>I am and quite well actually when I get to restaurants now. The more well known you get the more you get the occasional special drink or extra dessert, specifically in Brooklyn or Auckland. Instead of turning me away now I get the window seat. </p> <p><strong>Where's your head at?</strong></p> <p>It's firmly on my shoulders but half of it's still in bed. I have a two and a half year old son who we travel with everywhere and he's constantly talking when he's awake and when he's not awake. He talks constantly when he's asleep, he's just got a lot to say. So he keeps me constantly baffled and tired and of course the minute he gets up he wants me to be a pirate.</p> <p><strong>How clean is your house?</strong></p> <p>My actual house in Ponsonby in Auckland, New Zealand I have no idea because I've only been there for four weeks this year because we've mainly been in New York and London. I'm assuming it's clean. There's someone staying there and it was clean when we left.</p> <p><strong>Do you remember the first time?</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I remember the first time I did stand-up. I was 19 and there was an open-mic night in Christchurch. I thought: people are always laughing at me, this is my big chance. I had a Frank Spencer impression and a couple of jokes.</p> <p><strong>Are you a hypnotist?</strong></p> <p>I like to think I hypnotise people when I'm on stage. I don't just tell stories. I use mime and sound effects to really get people zoned in and entered into my world.</p> <p><strong>(What's the story) morning glory?</strong></p> <p>I went into the army straight from school. I was interested in war films and jet fighters. I loved the idea of all the uniforms and the gadgets, putting a helmet on and being in charge of a plane sending missiles into buildings. And then of course the reality hits that you have to be of a certain intellect to be a fighter pilot, good at physics and maths - both things I failed miserably at. So my dream of being a jet pilot faded and instead I decided to be a soldier, because all you need to do that is hold a gun and run around. It took me three and a half years to realise that it was actually playing the part of a soldier, not actually being one, that I really wanted to be. So that's how I ended up being an actor. </p> <p><strong>Who let the dogs out?</strong></p> <p>Murray's other band The Crazy Dogs.

  "<p>Once upon a time action movies were a dangerous, macho game, on a par with firefighting or deep sea fishing. Now they're an offshoot of the IT industry. In the age of green-screen and CGI, special effects departments have become drunk with processing power. Reality is but a plaything in their hands, human frailty can be glossed over with a mouse. As a result, anyone can be an action hero. Look what the century has brought us so far: a 14 year-old schoolboy whizzing around on a broomstick without even losing his glasses (Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter); a greying luvvie leading massed armies into battle (Ian McKellen in The Lord Of The Rings), and Hollywood's most notorious drug wreck starting a superhero franchise (Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man). What next? Dame Maggie Smith as Wonder Woman? </p> <p>As this is also the age of the DVD extra, we all know how these things are done. Rather than being spellbound by the latest feat of movie heroism, we're thinking: \"Yes he's leaping off a skyscraper on to a jet fighter, but really he was just jumping off a stool on to a mattress in front of a green wall.\" When you get to the climax of a film like Transformers or The Incredible Hulk and you're basically watching two computer programs beating the crap out of each other, you can start to wonder whether something's missing.</p> <p>What's been missing, it turns out, is good old-fashioned danger. Real stunts have been staging a comeback, and cinema is better off for them, as films like Bourne and Bond have shown. But something's changed. We don't just want our action heroes to act intrepid and athletic and superhuman, we want them to actually be action heroes for real. It's hard not to sound like Ross Kemp at this stage, but you're not a real action hero unless you're really doing the action. This new era of action calls for a new breed of actor-stuntman, equally versed in the arts of drama and danger, sort of David Tennant meets Andy McNab. Call it method action.</p> <p>Bond, of course, is the barometer here, and Daniel Craig is the method-action maestro. Matt Damon's Bourne movies undoubtedly prodded the franchise back into \"real action\" (see how they snapped up Bourne's key stunt people), after the invisible cars and fake kite-surfing of the late Brosnan reign. Craig was a credible man of action in Casino Royale, and its follow-up, Quantum Of Solace, has even more action. Before you've even remembered to turn off your mobile, Craig has already been through a car chase, a rooftop chase, a boat chase, and a few punch-ups. \"He gets his hands very dirty,\" says Gary Powell, chief stunt coordinator on both Quantum and Casino Royale. \"Daniel puts the work in, even if it's something he's not keen on. He's not a lover of heights but in Quantum Of Solace we've got him jumping out of a three-storey building on to the top of a moving bus. You've actually got to jump before the bus is under you.\"</p> <p>Bond movies have been setting stunt standards for the past 40 years, but the actors rarely got involved before now. Sean Connery never touched the stuff; quite sensibly he behaved like a star who couldn't afford to injure himself. \"Unless you see his face, it's a stunt double,\" says Powell of the Connery Bonds. He should know: it was usually his father or his uncle doubling for Connery, just as his elder brother doubled for Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton, and Powell himself did for Pierce Brosnan. In the Daniel Craig era, though, being Bond is a very different proposition. </p> <p>\"He does a lot more than Pierce used to do,\" says Powell, \"and he's allowed to because he's capable of doing it. He thinks, 'You're paying to see me, and that's me doing it.' He wants the audience to know.\" </p> <p>Powell, whose CV includes the likes of Bourne, Harry Potter, Terminator 3 and the latest Indiana Jones movie, has trained his fair share of actors, and he usually starts by gauging their abilities. \"You put them through basic fight training, have them run across a room, test their driving ability, see how they are with heights, and you build it up over 12 weeks' rehearsal to see what their enthusiasm is, and their attitude.\" Craig was a star pupil, of course, though he'd place Matt Damon and, more surprisingly, Shia LaBeouf in a similar category. </p> <p>This is by no means the first generation of method-action heroes. The lineage goes back through manly figures like Burt Reynolds, Steve McQueen and John Wayne right to the silent era. Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd were the tip of the iceberg, and since most silent movies demanded some stupendously dangerous combination of horse/motor car/speeding locomotive/damsel in distress, it's reasonable to assume that: a) Many people hurt and killed themselves, and b) Health and safety guidelines were in their infancy.</p> <p>That's the downside to real action. The stakes must be continually raised, which means more likelihood of someone getting hurt. There were some serious mishaps during the shooting of Quantum Of Solace. A car chase sequence on the shores of Italy's Lake Garda didn't go as planned, and one stunt driver had to be helicoptered to hospital. Earlier the same week an Aston Martin spun off the road and sank to the bottom of the lake; fortunately, the driver survived. </p> <p>Craig, too, got his fair share of cuts, bruises and black eyes, and at one point sliced off the top of a finger; no wonder he's reportedly been insured for \u00a35m. The public wants its real action, but the last thing the industry wants is an A-list of bruised, hospitalised and maimed actors. Perhaps they'll have to make computer trickery even better, and fake the outtakes as well to make everything look more dangerous than it really was.</p> <p>\u2022 Quantum Of Solace is out Fri</p> <h2>Method actioners </h2> <p><strong>Matt Damon</strong></p> <p>Set the mould with the Bourne movies, for which he did three months of boxing, martial arts and weapons training. Visibly did all of the fighting, jumping and crashing about in cars himself. </p> <p><strong>Christian Bale</strong></p> <p>No stranger to physical extremes (see The Machinist), Bale did all his fights and many stunts on the Batman movies (even though no one could tell it was him). In Rescue Dawn he swung from helicopters and threw himself down rivers in the Thai jungle.</p> <p><strong>Shia LaBeouf</strong></p> <p>Did \"95%\" of his own stunts on Transformers and Indiana Jones (as did Harrison Ford). Got hit in the eye by shrapnel from a bomb blast this year filming Transformers 2, but went straight back on set after treatment. </p> <p><strong>Jason Statham</strong></p> <p>Former international diver, trained in martial arts and wushu staff fighting with the Navy Seals. Did his own stunts for the Transporter movies and Death Race. Well hard.</p> <p><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></p> <p>The daddy of today's method actioners. Cruise did most of his own stunts for the Mission: Impossible movies, including extreme rock climbing and dodging trucks. None of which was as damaging to his career as the jumping-on-Oprah's-sofa stunt.</p>",
  "<p>Sad news of heartache! Our friends' daughter, Isobel, returned from school in tears this week. Taking directly to her bed, inconsolable, she reported between sobs that David had \"dumped\" her in favour of Poppy. \"How could David do this to me?\" she said. \"I loved him, and now I'm heartbroken, and he's with her.\" She spat out Poppy's name like a salty Chupa Chup and collapsed into her pink pillows. \"Now I don't suppose things will ever be the same,\" she sighed.</p> <p>Isobel, for the record, is six years old. Poppy, her love rival, is young for the year at five-and-three-quarters. David is the dirty old man in this triangle - he'll be seven in September. I like to reconstruct this coming-of-age drama from David's point of view. Every weekday, as custom encourages and the law requires, David shows up at school. School is nice. At playtime, David gets to play football with the other boys. There are girls in the playground too but they are apart, bonding over an intricate game involving elastic and jumping. After playtime, everyone goes inside to make stuff with crepe paper and glue. Inside, the girls are nearer, but still they register on David's vision only as a skittish blur, an undifferentiated cloud. For perhaps a week, one of these girls elects to spend an unusual amount of time on David's table - she almost registers on his senses. He doesn't catch her name. One day, a different girl approaches the table and says hello to David. He says hello back. The new girl smiles in triumph. David looks bemused. The two girls begin to argue, they disappear back into the nameless cloud, and David never notices either of them again.</p> <p>Later in this same week, the Institute of Education releases a report revealing that girls are more advanced than boys from the age of five. \"Say it isn't so!\" I cry. But the more research I do, the more I discover that the gap is real and widening. As society evolves, six-year-old girls enjoy a level of social sophistication that is humbling to a boy of my age. If I feel a special awe in Isobel's case it's because her parents - devout atheists - once asked my wife and me to look after Isobel should they ever both perish in a car wreck. In case this makes me Isobel's there-is-no-godfather, I worry if I should mentor her personal and spiritual development. Fortunately, it's more likely to happen the other way around. I cite Isobel's speedy recovery from the whole menage vis-a-vis David and Poppy. Rising from her tear-stained pillows, she declared: \"It's OK, Mummy, I'm completely over David now. I'm going to marry Katie instead. Because girls can marry girls these days, can't they? It's just not a problem any more.\"</p> <p>It's not only in love that girls are so grown up - it's in life itself. They're not so much doing things better than boys, as literally playing another game. My boys are two and five and they play pirates from 500 years ago, or space rangers from 50 decades hence. The intervening millennium holds no more attraction for them than broccoli. But girls play in the here-and-now, which is maybe how they get so damned good at it. Other friends of ours have two daughters whose favourite game is called \"governments\". Emma, five, always plays Gordon Brown, while Holly, two, is Alistair Darling. </p> <p>It has taken me 35 years to understand why I'm useless at real life - but now the penny has dropped, we've reassigned our roles at home. My wife, being schooled in reality, is henceforth in charge of the Here-and-Now. I am officially responsible for Pipe Dreams, and also Mistakes That Were Made In The Past. And as for our boys, very next school playtime, I'm encouraging them to learn that intricate game involving elastic and jumping.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dear Annalisa,</strong></p> <p>It was my 50th birthday two months ago. My brother still hasn't sent me a present or even a card. I always put a lot of thought into buying him the perfect gift. I can't very well ask him outright. How can I make him remember (and feel guilty enough to do something about it)? Or maybe I'm overreacting?</p> <p>Paula, London</p> <p>Well, you're not overreacting if it matters to you. But the question really is: why does it matter so much to you? My sister rarely buys me a birthday present (but always sends a card) and neither do my closest friends. I couldn't give a hoot about it. I think it's easy to buy a present and \"dis-obligate\" yourself. This is a word I have made up - it means to buy a present simply to do the right thing, not because any thought has gone into it, so the giver is let off the hook. </p> <p>You say you put a lot of thought into buying him the perfect gift. But this is subjective. Maybe he doesn't like your presents and wants to break the \"I'll buy you something, you buy me something\" cycle. I loathe that - I would rather not have a present than be given something bought just for the sake of it. Is your brother older or younger? Do you feel ignored by him in other things? Does he remember everyone else's birthday but not yours? If the latter, then I would say that this is passive-aggressive behaviour and contrived to annoy you. Whether you bat back with more passive-aggressive behaviour is up to you. Or you could break the cycle by talking to him. I can't believe how much energy and emotion is wasted by people thinking things but not discussing it with the person concerned. \"I can't very well ask him outright,\" you say. Why not? What would happen? You care, so why not admit it? He's not a mind-reader, yet you are really cross with him for behaviour that you haven't given him a chance to put right.</p> <p>If you try subtle means to make him a) remember your birthday and b) buy you something, you need to bear in mind that you can't make him remember and you can't make him feel guilty. The more effort you put into trying, the more angry and resentful you'll feel if he doesn't do as you want. </p> <p>Let me tell you a little story. I am very close to my father, but for years, ever since I was a child, he'd say something that really upset me. It was this: \"One day I'm going to go off and live on my own in a house in the middle of nowhere.\" The child in me found this ridiculously rejecting, even though the adult in me understood what he meant. One day, aged really grown up, I said to him: \"Daddy, I get really upset when you say that, silly though it may sound. But I'm telling you I find it really upsetting. If you say it again, now that you know, I'll have to conclude that you are saying it to hurt me.\"</p> <p>It's an honest, to-the-point statement and enormously powerful. You leave the other person with nowhere to go. Unless they are truly amnesiac they can't say or do it again because they show their hand: that they are doing it expressly to upset you. And that takes courage, which rarely goes hand in hand with bad behaviour. It's like the cowardly person who delivers a stinging comment under the safety of the prefix of \"I don't mean to be bitchy but ... \"</p> <p>My father has never said it since. And he is a really macho Italian man. You could try something similar with your brother if the birthday-remembering is really the issue and not masking a lifetime of resentment and seething sibling \"stuff\" (I hope you like my scientific words). You could also try another tack: forget about the present (you cannot make him buy you something unless a gun or blackmail is involved, so accept it) and just ring him up on your birthday and say: \"Hello, it's my birthday today and I'm just calling to let you know I'm accepting birthday wishes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kwadoi Marbiah graduated this summer from De Montfort University with a degree in marketing management. \"I have really enjoyed studying marketing since I did my A-levels,\" she explains. \"I think it's dynamic and fast-paced.\"</p> <p>During her degree, Marbiah took a one-year work placement at a credit union, which she believes has given her valuable work experience. \"I enjoyed it thoroughly,\" she says. \"I thought it was going to be just a typical work placement - just making tea and coffee. But I was actually given a lot of responsibility.\"</p> <p>She's now looking to apply her talents to a career in conferences and event management. \"It seems like there would be a lot of variety in that sector,\" she says, \"which is what I'm looking for. And I'd like a job with an international aspect to it, that would allow me to travel.\"</p> <p>We asked Claire Gapper, event producer at Maverick Events Worldwide, to mock interview Marbiah for an entry-level job. Then we asked her what she thought.</p> <p>\"We work on everything from product launches to conferences to brand experiences and integrated campaigns,\" explains Gapper. \"We are also experts in internal communications and about half our work is internal events.\" About 80% of Maverick's work is global, estimates Gapper, with events taking place worldwide.</p> <p>The company prides itself on being able to provide clients with unusual events. \"We try not to offer the standard 'conference room in a hotel' solution,\" says Gapper. \"A lot of people assume that a hotel ballroom is the only option for a conference but we say that they don't have to settle for that.\"</p> <p>As a result, a degree of imagination and creativity is useful. \"It's mainly about absorbing information,\" says Gapper. \"Reading magazines, picking up ideas and storing them, whether it's from interior design, or a new restaurant you're at. You also need the ability to explore and research.\"</p> <p>She adds that the industry is not as glamorous as it might appear. \"People say, 'You must go to lovely parties!' but it's not really like that.\" And she reckons that the main skill involved is being \"overly organised. If somebody asks you where something is, you need to know.\"</p> <p>But above all else, personality counts. \"We find that you can learn on the job, and there's a great support network here. You need a can-do attitude, an ability to muck in and get your hands dirty, be able to manage your time, be efficient and willing to work long hours when necessary, keep a cool head and be able to communicate well.\"</p> <p>On the personality stakes, Marbiah scored highly. \"She was lovely,\" says Gapper. \"She had a wonderful confidence without being arrogant, and she made it clear that she was keen to learn - which is what we look for.\"</p> <p>The experience she gained on her year out from university also stood her in good stead. \"I can definitely see the difference in people who have had work experience, because they learn what's expected from employers in a corporate role,\" says Gapper. </p> <p>Gapper's advice to Marbiah is to make more of her relevant experience. \"Her CV is very strong on her marketing background, which is good to see,\" she says, \"but people in this industry will be looking for some events experience too. Kwadoi has been helping a friend set up an events agency and it sounds like she's been doing quite a lot. She should absolutely promote that.\"</p> <p>Marbiah felt that the interview went well. \"It's a nice company, and Claire was lovely,\" she says. \"I am usually quite relaxed in interviews anyway but that helped and I think I was able to give good answers.\"</p> <p>Gapping agrees. \"She was very smart and eloquent, she'd done research on the company and she came across really well.

  "<p>A gun-metal grey speedboat powers across the still Ionian Sea until the cypress trees of the largest private estate in Corfu heave into view and the pilot kills the engine. </p> <p>Above are the cream castle turrets of Nathaniel Rothschild's family villa set in olive groves and woods that stretch from valley to valley. According to local boatmen, the Rothschilds use this military-style craft to whisk their guests at a speed of 50 knots directly from the airport to a corner of north-east Corfu where the secluded coves and remote luxury villas have become a discreet playground for the rich and powerful to mix business and pleasure. </p> <p>The idyllic spot was thrust into an unwelcome spotlight last week with revelations about the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, and his alleged attempts to solicit a \u00a350,000 donation for the Tory party from Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska while holidaying on the island. The shadow chancellor denies the allegation. </p> <p>Osborne and Peter Mandelson - whose stay on Deripaska's \u00a380m yacht, Queen K, led to the trade secretary facing his own set of awkward questions - are not the only famous faces to be seen. </p> <p>The area has become known as \"Kensington-on-Sea\" after the west London enclave of Russian oligarchs, bankers and Conservative politicians who now flock here. </p> <p>The parish of Kassiopi with its simple tavernas set on inaccessible inlets has become a haven for businessmen, politicians, media moguls, art dealers and lawyers. Aside from the Rothschilds, Lord Sainsbury, the Duke of Westminster, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are regular visitors, as are the Agnelli family which controls Fiat, and Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea Football Club owner.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch and his daughter, Elisabeth, who runs a network of TV production companies in the UK and the US, also drop anchor here on their own floating gin palaces. They gathered with Osborne, Mandelson, Deripaska and others over an August weekend in this quiet sparsely populated bay where business can be done in private and it is just a short tender ride to the Rothschild estate with its artificial waterfalls and infinity pool painted cobalt blue to match the sea.</p> <p>Many barely touch land, buzzing about in handmade Italian boats and sleeping on yachts. For a light lunch or boozy dinner there is the Agni Taverna, the outdoor restaurant where \"pure poison\" dripped when Mandelson, Osborne and Rothschild dined together.</p> <p>Thousands of lesser-known Britons flock here, too. On the shingle beaches polo shirts are worn collar up and the swimming trunks of choice are Vilebrequin which retail at more than \u00a370 a pair. Dads clutch their Blackberries while mums round up the children, sometimes aided by a nanny. It is little Britain of a very particular kind.</p> <p>The local municipality estimates at least 400 British families live here permanently, or at least half of the year, and there are 500 villas for rent dotted along this 15-mile stretch of coastline. It is a long way from raucous Kavos on the island's southern tip, where police once caught tourists having an organised oral sex competition and there is a nightclub called \"Sex\". </p> <p>According to Nathan Pascoe, a Briton who owns Agni Travel and the Agni Taverna, the Kassiopi crowd is the same that holidays in the Cornish village of Rock. \"They all know each other and come back again and again taking big tables of up to 30 people,\" he says. \"Often they are bankers or art dealer types.\" </p> <p>By all accounts, the visitors revel in the anonymity that a trip to Barbados or the C\u00f4te d'Azur, where the paparazzi lurk in the waters, could never guarantee.</p> <p>David Cameron was given a table at the back last year, largely because the waitress didn't recognise him. When he was the mayor of London Ken Livingstone made two or three trips here, say locals.</p> <p>Agni Taverna is an ordinary restaurant, albeit with enchanting views to the mountains of Albania and a friendly black and white cat. On Saturday August 23, 28 of Elisabeth Murdoch's friends sat down for her 40th birthday party to eat house specials including stuffed sardines, fried courgettes and rack of lamb. </p> <p>A version of the conversation between Osborne, Mandelson and Rothschild later appeared in The Sunday Times, suggesting Mandelson, then a European commissioner, had spoken ill of Gordon Brown. Osborne had apparently broken the code that what happens on holiday stays on holiday. Rothschild then uttered his explosive allegations about Osborne's party funding discussions.</p> <p>With the friendship of the two Oxford University contemporaries apparently shattered, it raises questions about why so many visitors here try to make professional headway as well as relax. </p> <p>\"It's a sign of the times perhaps, but a lot of people who come here now demand wireless internet access,\" said Stella Lewis, who rents villas for Agni Travel. </p> <p>\"We don't normally have it so you see a lot of them down in the taverna with their laptops using the wifi there. People don't seem to be able to stop working even when they are on holiday.\"</p> <p>Osborne's claim that he discussed \"British and Russian politics, education and Russian history\" when he nipped onto Deripaska's yacht one Sunday evening seems to bear that out.</p> <p>Boltholes in the area are in ever increasing demand, especially as the mayor, George Pantazis, a 59-year-old retired colonel, refuses to allow hotels to be built in the belief they would spoil a landscape that Lord Rothschild himself has described as providing \"one of the most spectacular marine views in the world\". </p> <p>Standing in his grand pink-walled mayoral office on a rocky promontory, Pantazis points out of the window to a plot that was recently put up for sale at \u20ac11m (\u00a38.8m) following the death of an elderly farmer. Roman Abramovich had visited and was interested. In the end, the mayor said, it went to the Rothschilds who are keeping it undeveloped, apparently to maintain the area's pristine credentials.</p> <p>\"The people who live here are rich,\" said Pantazis. \"The land is expensive and they build luxurious houses. Eleven million euros seems a lot for that land. But I suppose if they have it, they can give it. I certainly don't have it. The Rothschild estate is very large and is private, but as locals we can access it by boat and use its beaches. But we respect the property and these people because of what they bring to this part of the island. By not over-developing, they are protecting our landscape.\" </p> <p>Now the turquoise-shuttered Agnelli villa at Kouloura, two bays south of the Rothschilds' and a three-minute boat hop to the Agni Taverna, is said to be up for sale at \u20ac15m. With its own marina, and at the heart of the Kassiopi scene, it would make a perfect bolthole for anyone who, after the experience of Mandelson and Osborne, still believes the beach is a good place for business.</p>",
  "<h2>Is the Sarah Palin coverage in the media sexist?</h2> <p>An objective measure of bias in this case isn't hard to find: let's compare the treatment of Palin to that of Hillary Clinton during her presidential run against Barack Obama. Both women were subjected to critiques that would not have been levelled at their male counterparts - think this week's row over Palin's $150,000 (\u00a395,000) clothes budget and the bizarre scrutiny of Clinton's cleavage in the US last year.</p> <p>But while US TV pundits slammed Clinton as \"witchy\" and wondered if she were \"pimping out\" her daughter for voters, Palin's own political party was handing out campaign buttons depicting her as \"the hottest governor from the coldest state\". When Palin tossed a wink at the camera during the vice-presidential debate, Republican scribe Rich Lowry sighed that he \"sat up a little straighter on the couch and said, 'hey, I think she just winked at me'.\" </p> <p>It's tough to deem Palin a victim of media sexism when no small part of the fixation on her looks came from the Republican camp. In addition, McCain aides muddied the waters by claiming that any inquiry into her past was sexist.</p> <p>The biggest test of media attitudes toward Palin came via the debate over her pricey outfits, purchased by Republicans eager to present a polished image of their new star. While mainstream fashion editors offered catty assessments of her shoe choices, one of Palin's strongest defenders also came from the media. \"Women are judged based on their appearance far, far more than men,\" CNN presenter Campbell Brown told viewers on Wednesday. \"All women in the public eye deal with this.\"</p> <p>But let's ask Palin herself whether reporters have shown gender bias against her. Palin, 44, who once accused Clinton of \"whining\" about sexism, said earlier this month: \"It would be sexist if the media were to hold back and not ask me about my experience, my vision.\" </p> <p>After the damaging shopping scandal erupted, however, she began likening the media's treatment of her to none other than Hillary Clinton.<br><strong>Elana Schor</strong></p> <h2>Does celebrity status make you ill?</h2> <p>Kerry Katona's \"erratic behaviour\" on ITV1's This Morning this week raises this question once again. In my opinion, celebrity status is highly likely to make its recipient ill. Although fledgling celebrities won't necessarily show symptoms straight away, it doesn't take long before they start to suffer.</p> <p>Why is this? How can it be that what appears so desirable is actually so deleterious? This is the case for two reasons - the sudden unnecessary wealth and the constant scrutiny that accompany celebrity status.</p> <p>Human beings are group animals. Alone, we cannot meet all our needs. That's why it feels so good to give - we're neurochemically reinforced for sharing. However, when one individual is suddenly given far more than she needs, her initial reaction is usually emotional and immature. She becomes greedy. It takes time, and mature reflection, to realise that giving is more fun. And very few celebrities are given the opportunity for any calm reflection at all, let alone enough to figure this out. JK Rowling and Bill Gates come to mind, but few others.</p> <p>The reason there's no chance to reflect is because of the second factor, the constant scrutiny. Physicists have shown that even a \"mindless\" particle is affected if it's observed by one pair of eyes - think of the effect of millions of pairs of eyes on one poor celebrity! This new experience causes its victim to feel vaguely out of control, so she looks to \"cure\" herself using her wealth. Most of the \"cures\" carry their own dangers, thus compounding her problems.</p> <p>However, it's oversimplifying to say that celebrity status \"causes\" illness. It would be better to say that celebrity status brings out inherent weaknesses and makes an individual more vulnerable to illness - in particular, mental illness. My advice, therefore, if you detect an opportunity for stardom, is to run away from it - as fast as you can. <br><strong>Linda Blair</strong></p> <h2>Are pints the wrong size?</h2> <p>The pub trade in Britain is famously conservative and beer drinkers love tradition. So the notion of a new two-thirds of a pint measure prompted laughter, scorn and cries of \"Southern Jessie Plot\" yesterday at the Jug and Barrel in Stanningley, Leeds.</p> <p>\"No, no, no, no!\" cried out truck driver Richard Lee over his pint of locally-brewed bitter. \"We don't want less beer. We want more.\"</p> <p>The aim of the proposal, in a consultation paper from the National Weights and Measures Laboratory, is to offer more choice to consumers. Innocuous; but to win over public-bar drinkers, it might be wiser to start with a larger new measure. </p> <p>\"Why not a pint-and-a-half?\" asked other regulars. Or a litre (except the latter triggers growls about continental ways). But wouldn't 36-year-old Lee's women friends go for something a bit less hefty than a pint, but not as little-girly, lager-and-limey as a half?</p> <p>\"No. Yorkshirewomen drink pints,\" he said firmly. The barmaid agreed and couldn't see anyone wanting to get into complications such as thirds. The only dissent came from Barrie Pepper, author of a series of guides to pubs in Yorkshire and an occasional drinker at the pub. </p> <p>\"We shouldn't be scared of a bit of innovation,\" said Pepper. \"I found third-of-a-pints very useful when they introduced them at the Leeds beer festival last year. It's a good quantity if you're sampling a range of different beers.\" </p> <p>Lee conceded that two-thirds glasses might make inroads in London, and Pepper noted a possible similarity with limited attempts to bring in half-litre measures a decade ago. \"The idea there was to try to keep the price of a glass of beer below \u00a31,\" he said. \"For the breweries in hard times, a two-thirds measure might have the same appeal.\"<br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Send us your questions about the week's news by midday every Friday and our experts will answer them in Saturday's Guardian.

  "<p>Credit where credit's due. I pinched the Blue Lion Inn from Angela Hartnett's list of favourite places which recently appeared in Guardian Weekend. So handsome was the Blue Lion on the net, I couldn't resist. What's more, 15 rooms are divided between the original coaching inn and a newly built annexe, so whatever Hartnett-rated indulgences take place in its restaurant, bed will be only a short stagger away. </p> <p>The inn stands tidily at the roadside, just before a bend, as if in introduction to East Witton's village green, an unfurled carpet up ahead, flanked by little grey cottages and picket fences. Leaving Tim to unload, I slip through a back door to reception. Two minutes later we are shown to rooms in the annexe adjacent to the car park. </p> <p>\"Nice touch - Yorkshire, see?\" says Tim, deftly throwing his room key, which has a full-size cricket ball as its keyring, up in the air. We like the rooms: high-ceilinged, with exposed beams, kitted out in cream, dark wood and leather. There is a restful symmetry and each has a decent bathroom. \"That's even big enough for you,\" says Tim, opening the door of my giant wardrobe to reveal just four lonesome hangers. </p> <p>Notes tell me that fresh milk, an iron and ironing board can be supplied, and in a drawer I find the hairdryer (oh, and someone else's old hairbrush). A pot of Twinings over the evening news (reclining against plumped-up pillows), then I join Tim in the bar. </p> <p>\"Well timed, you've just missed the rabble,\" he says. \"There was a shooting party in here a moment ago.\" We order Black Sheep draught beers. \"Oh my God,\" he groans, halfway through the second pint of Riggwelter. \"It's 5.9%. I'm going to be trashed.\" </p> <p>Supping our beer, we are soon lulled into a state of total contentment, but even if the barrels had run dry and there was only flat Coke for sale, I would still want to be in this bar because it is perfect in every way. From low lighting which contrives a Dickensian atmosphere (\"Bring on winter's short days,\" it seems to say), to a ceiling pocked with old hooks; from the menu, full of promise, chalked up around its perimeter, to an ancient, curving settle of wood, leather and horsehair, and newspapers hanging by the door, it is most emphatically my Bar of the Year. </p> <p>With sound steering from owner Paul Klein, we order, and cross the hallway into the restaurant to sit beneath a crimson ceiling and indulge.</p> <p>Cooking is a serious matter here, with game high on the agenda right now, though I could just as easily have gone for the special vegetarian menu (in the end, we share a sublime starter of tagliatelle with wild mushrooms, parmesan, cream and thyme sauce). </p> <p>The tables are a generous girth - no balancing acts or elbow-banging. Staff, in black and starched white, and the manager of 10 years, Craig Turner (who will tell tall tales at the bar if you let him), are the sort who make running a tight ship look like plain sailing. </p> <p>Yet, despite all the attention to detail, it isn't the least stuffy - and no one can put that to the test better than Tim and I. We don't do reverential whispering at the table; instead we're doing our own version of the Monty Python Mr Creosote sketch and competing - over a degustation pudding plate for two - to say \"waffeur\" in the most exaggerated French accent.

  "<p>On almost the last page of Behind the Scenes at the Museum, Atkinson's protagonist and narrator Ruby Lennox tells us that her sister Patricia has paid someone to draw their family tree - \"a huge, chaotic arboretum\". Patricia's \"thirst for genealogy\" is shared by her creator, for the novel fictionally recovers the lost stories of Ruby's relations. Patricia has herself been long-lost, walking out of the family home after having a child as a teenager, and turning up many years (and several chapters) later in Australia, married with two children. Throughout the novel, lost family members turn up in the story.</p> <p>Really attentive readers of Atkinson's novel might themselves feel in need of just such a family tree. (You can actually find one at <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/kateatkinson14/behind.htm\">geocities.com/kateatkinson14/behind.htm</a>.) The saga spans four generations of the narrator's family, with a cast too large to be held easily in the memory. Yet perhaps the reader who is in the middle of the book should hesitate before downloading this guide. For while it will remind you of what you have forgotten in earlier chapters, it also reveals every secret that Atkinson has withheld, every surprising turn of her plot.</p> <p>The novel does not march us down the decades like most sagas, but recovers the past in a series of \"footnotes\", artfully arranged to solve mysteries only in the novelist's good time. Many of the footnotes condense narratives that could be agonising if stretched out. Near the end of the novel, for instance, we get the capsule story of Ruby's great-grandmother Alice, who flees her drunkard husband with an itinerant French photographer. She leaves her six children behind for a life spent regretting having done so. Years later, she tries desperately but unsuccessfully to find them again, and when, as an old woman, she is killed in a German bombing raid, she is found with an old photograph of them clutched to her. Here is a whole potential novel in 10 parenthetic pages.</p> <p>Ruby's narrative refers us in brackets to such footnotes for background to her story, but she always refers us to a footnote that we have yet to read. The detail from the past comes after the episode in the present that it elucidates. And after each detour to the past, we come back to Ruby's present-tense narration, which saves us from sentimentality by re-enacting her youthful thoughts with cruel candour, especially in \"sad\" moments. Going to see the body of her grandmother Nell at the funeral parlour, she notes how the texture of her skin bears \"an uncanny resemblance to Christine Roper's tortoise\". She notes only feeling \"very guilty\" that she experiences none of the anguish she knew when the animals in her parents' pet shop were killed in a fire.</p> <p>The complications of the Lennox family tree are a consequence of melancholy events. It is a diagram not just of births, marriages and deaths, but of puzzles and abandonments. Even a version prepared by the most conscientious student of the novel is full of question marks in place of unnamed parents or unidentified offspring. In the novel's last chapter, at the bedside of the narrator's dying mother, a nurse mentions that she never knew her own mother. In a couple of sentences she sketches her story and the odd details suggest to us - but not to the listening characters - that she too is related to this family, perhaps the \"lost\" daughter of Bunty's cousin Edmund, a question mark on the family tree.</p> <p>It should all be emotionally draining, as family sagas are supposed to be, but the constant return to Ruby's narration precludes mournfulness. The accidents of family life, even its disasters, are comically comprehended. Atkinson and her narrator have in mind a famous example of how to combine tragic family history and comic first-person narration. In Ruby's introductory sketch of York, where the novel is set, she asks the visiting reader to \"listen hard\" for sounds of its past, from the Viking oars rowing up the Ouse to \"the scratch-scratch of the Reverend Sterne's quill\". </p> <p>The Reverend Sterne is Laurence Sterne, author of Tristram Shandy and a local celebrity in 18th-century York. He is a presiding spirit of the novel, which opens with an overt parody of the opening of Tristram Shandy - Ruby, like Tristram, beginning her story not even from her birth, but from the moment of her conception. It is the first of many Shandean allusions. Sterne's novel shows how one person's story can take us back through the generations in a pattern of digressions. It also offers comic autobiographical narrative in the face of death. Sterne's fictional alter ego was Parson Yorick, the jester in the graveyard.</p> <p>Ruby's narrative is peppered with such fitting but incongruous literary references. Ruby's teenage sister disappears after she has announced her pregnancy while on a hellish family holiday in Scotland. She is eventually discovered near the so-called Bottomless Lock, \"mooching mournfully, a bit like Miss Jessel, amongst the reeds and sedge\". (Readers of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw will get the joke.) Ruby's self-destructive adolescent urge to smash her hand through the patio window is explained by her likening of herself to Cathy's ghost in Wuthering Heights. Aged 16, she does try to kill herself, hiding in the airing cupboard and swallowing lots of pills. But the suicidal urge is comic, too. Imagining drowning herself to escape her widowed mother and her ghastly new man friend, she is really \"practising Millais's Ophelia for when the River Foss recovers from its unseasonably low level\". (The Ouse that flows through York is sufficiently deep but not sufficiently pre-Raphaelite to tempt her to extinction.)

  "<p>This exhaustive work of synthesis marks the culmination of Richard Evans's trilogy on the rise and fall of Nazism. Unlike the previous volumes, it cannot by the nature of its subject confine itself to Germany, and as German troops head abroad so does the author. Much of the book is given over to an account of the conquest of Europe, its rule and the subsequent collapse. But as the empire shrinks, so the narrative returns to the Reich and to the apocalyptic finale which left those Germans who survived the Allied bombers and Gestapo executioners little if any better off than those whom they had ruled so brutally. </p> <p>It is a lengthy but readable work, and the narrative is interspersed with extracts from some of the war's most vivid firsthand accounts - the travails of the Polish doctor, Zygmunt Klukowski, the amazing survival story of Victor Klemperer and the bitter questioning of the soldier, Wilm Hosenfeld. Beyond this lies a remarkable massif of recent scholarly writings. The author has researched an impressive range of sources and the key findings of other historians on the Nazi war economy, military strategy and the evolution of the Final Solution are effectively integrated into a single story. </p> <p>Evans begins with the invasion of Poland. Recent research has shown this to have been every bit as brutal - if on a smaller scale - as what followed nearly two years later in the Soviet Union. It was in Poland that the SS first set the parameters for the coming race war as it engaged in an orgy of violence against civilians. Evans rightly implicates the Wehrmacht in this as well, although he blurs the distinction between the shooting of civilians in cold blood and the army's longstanding military policy of vicious reprisals that was unleashed by the Poles' resistance. Evans also follows Ian Kershaw and Christopher Browning, two of the most scrupulous historians of the Holocaust, in showing how the Final Solution grew out of the failure of Nazi population politics more generally in Poland. Expulsions of both Poles and Jews were blocked and the Jews were forced into ghettoes. </p> <p>While Evans does not present the Nazi war effort as solely obsessed with the destruction of the Jews, the genocide is never far from his mind. Perhaps extermination was always implicit in the regime's ideology, but Evans does not dwell on the likelihood of the so-called Madagascar option (a forced expulsion of Jews from central Europe). Neither does he explain why the regime was still expelling Jews from Germany into France as late as October 1940. </p> <p>He is good on the gradual blurring between Nazis and other Germans, but says less about how anti-semitism in the Third Reich compared with elsewhere. If it was peculiarly Nazi in its virulence, one would have to explain why other countries such as Romania and Croatia were competing with Germany in sheer murderousness. </p> <p>In fact, what was justified in the name of National Socialist ideology needs to be seen firmly within the context of the war. Time and again, the sheer whirl of events pressed itself unexpectedly upon this regime where brawn outstripped brains. That the Final Solution grew out of the contradictions implicit in the regime's attempt at demographic engineering in occupied Poland is now clear. </p> <p>What is unclear is the origin of the forced population transfer policy that brought ethnic Germans back \"home\" and turfed out Poles, Jews and others to make way for them. Was it some kind of long-term prewar plan to realise the dreams of Mein Kampf? Scarcely. </p> <p>The whole disastrous policy was only triggered in the first days of the war itself because the panicked Baltic German minority mistakenly feared that the Red Army was about to come and massacre them all and begged Berlin for help. As it was, Stalin had no such intention and those high up in the Reich were taken by surprise. Yet, within weeks, they were talking as though they had always planned on moving hundreds of thousands of people around. It sounded as if it was going to be easy and Himmler was already planning for a new racial order in the east that would have allowed the SS to expel or kill more than 50 million people by 1970.</p> <p>On the Nazi New Order's continental dimensions, Evans is solid, although one wonders about his characterisation of interwar Yugoslavia as an \"artificial creation\" (was it any more artificial than Czechoslovakia, Belgium or Germany?), or the idea that Hitler's lawyer, Hans Frank, was placed in charge of rump Poland as a means of sidelining him. Focused on the regime's anti-Jewish drive, he offers the reader less guidance on the strange ambiguities of its attitude towards the Slavs (after all, Hitler's allies, the Slovaks and Croats, were Slavs too) or on the complexities of collaboration in the west. But when the war goes bad, and the narrative returns to concentrate on the Reich, his skills as an expert on German social history really emerge. </p> <p>The role of the church and the army in resisting the Nazis is succinctly weighed up, and there are brilliant passages on wartime cultural life and the universities. Furtwangler conducts Beethoven's Ninth Symphony for Hitler's birthday. Party favourite Werner Egk earns handsomely by writing works which likened the conquest of the USSR to Columbus's discovery of America. </p> <p>But at the same time, there were complaints about falling standards in the classrooms, and fewer classrooms of any kind as the bombing raids intensified. In fact, almost the only wartime success of the Nazi German Students' League was to get students to abandon the practice of duelling; there were now plenty of other ways of demonstrating one's courage. </p> <p>As the regime turned its terror on ordinary Germans, such demonstrations took more unexpected forms. Yet even to the end, as Evans notes, many Germans still believed in the F\u00fchrer. One air force officer's wife compared Hitler to Jesus Christ, suffering under what she saw as his lonely burden for the sake of the Nazi idea.</p> <p>It was during the David Irving libel trial that Richard Evans became well-known for championing the cause of historical truth against Holocaust revisionism. As he argued, the ideal virtue of the professional historian is to use the evidence responsibly so that he or she can be trusted when making evaluations of historical responsibility. And few areas of the past have been more closely tied to such evaluations than the Third Reich. </p> <p>Who was responsible for the rise of Nazism? For the outbreak of war in 1939? For the atrocities that followed? The history of modern Germany has been written more than any other under the sign of responsibility and The Third Reich at War is a book very aware of that imperative. It does not dwell on the ways in which the Nazis may have been uncomfortably like other Europeans, nor on the grey zones and ambiguities of occupation. What it does is more than valuable enough. In its no-nonsense, emphatic way, it gives the reader persuasive answers to questions asked for so long, that will continue to be asked, about this most violent and inexplicable of regimes and the people in whose name it ruled. </p> <p>\u2022 Mark Mazower's Hitler's Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>There are numerous books that promise to help you \"think like a genius\", or like Einstein, or even - if Einstein isn't good enough - How To Think Like History's 10 Most Revolutionary Minds. But they're beset with problems. Some try to teach a \"secret formula\", even though following someone else's five-step system is surely antithetical to genius. Some confuse correlation with causation: Thomas Jefferson was an early riser, and he basically invented the US, so you should get up early, too! Others are plain odd. In How To Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci, Michael Gelb recommends doing an \"ambiguity dance\" to express feelings about uncertainty. I can't imagine Leonardo doing an ambiguity dance. Though if he had done, maybe he'd have come up with a flying machine that actually worked, the loser.</p> <p>\"Genius\" is a slippery word, anyway. The American neuroscientist Gregory Berns uses a different term as the title of his new book on thinking differently: Iconoclast. Looking at original thinking as \"iconoclastic\" - as disruptive of the usual ways we're conditioned to see the world - turns out to be much more useful. It may even help you think a bit more like Leonardo. </p> <p>Berns' starting point is that the brain \"is fundamentally a lazy piece of meat\": it needs energy to operate, and has evolved to use it as efficiently as possible. So when it perceives the outside world, or imagines things, the average brain uses as many short cuts as it can - past experience, other people's opinions - to avoid the taxing effort of perceiving or imagining afresh. It's literally harder work to perceive what you're not expecting to perceive, which is why airport security screeners who watch thousands of harmless bags roll by will at times fail to notice even a very prominent gun. To test the brain's laziness for yourself, Berns suggests, close your eyes and imagine the sun setting on a beach: the image is such a clich\u00e9 that it's tough to visualise it except in vague and clich\u00e9d form. (Now see what happens if you imagine a sunset on Pluto.) One solution is to \"bombard the brain with things it has never encountered before\", to deny it the opportunity to use short cuts - by travelling, meeting new people, working in a different environment, or reading about unfamiliar subjects. </p> <p>But there's another barrier to iconoclastic thinking: fear. Once you've jolted your brain on to a new path of thought, pursuing it further - either in your head or by acting on it - will stimulate the fear of uncertainty, failure or disapproval. I've often wondered if this is why many people get their best ideas in the shower, or why I get them on trains and planes - contexts where you can't physically put an idea into practice and so, for the time being, can't fail, either. Iconoclasts find ways to coexist with their fears, Berns says. It's by learning that skill, and by actively seeking unfamiliar experience, that we non-iconoclasts can emulate them. Ambiguity dances? Not so much.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Poor George Osborne. He is a sort of anti-Groucho Marx. One cannot help but suspect he has spent his life desperately caring to belong to clubs that don't really want him as a member. </p> <p>That said, the unravelling of events this past week has been screamingly funny - if not quite A Night at the Opera, then certainly An Afternoon in Corfu. For weeks after he first leaked the story of Peter Mandelson's Greek island poison-dripping about Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor had been disporting himself with the gravity-resistant cockiness of a cartoon character who has run over the edge of a cliff, but has yet to look down. That particular illusion has come to an abrupt end, and it is now Mandelson's turn to evoke the stuff of fiction, with his twinkly-eyed refusal to condemn Osborne, after that job has been done for him, more than a little redolent of Francis Urquhart's: \"You might think that; I couldn't possibly comment.\"</p> <p>To class Osborne as socially out of his depth in all of this might seem odd: he has led a gilded life, after all. But reading this tale of yachts and billionaires and people who need not trouble themselves with anything so vulgar as democracy, he seems a mere parvenu, whose maladroit grasp of etiquette now threatens to destroy him. (I am somehow reminded of that other supposed big hitter, Sir Alex Ferguson, being devastatingly outmanoeuvred by the tycoons John Magnier and JP McManus over the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, a row in which the Manchester United manager was made powerfully aware of the minuscule nature of the pond in which he was the big fish.)</p> <p>George's family are in wallpaper. Trade, I suppose you'd call it for a laugh, and though he wouldn't be required to use the back entrance - his father is the 17th baronet - there is much to suggest he has always been more Charles Ryder than Sebastian Flyte.</p> <p>At the Bullingdon Club he was known as Oik, on account of having gone to St Paul's as opposed to somewhere proper like Eton or Harrow. It's only surmise, but one suspects he was rather more often the Bullingdon's raggee than the ragger, with one such ragging a neat metaphor for what has been happening to him all week. The young Osborne was held upside down by his fellow members, who banged his head on the floor each time he failed to answer correctly the question: \"What are you?\" He got it eventually. The unexpurgated answer was: \"I am a despicable cunt.\" </p> <p>Even in the newest Bullingdon photo to surface, Osborne looks gauche. There's something brittle and unconvincing to his swagger, tucked away downstage right in a made-up bow tie, while Nat Rothschild stares inscrutably out from the centre. Hand-tied bow tie, obviously.</p> <p>Much has been made of Rothschild's private nature, and he seems to have an instinctive grasp of how to turn any weaker personality traits - perhaps even catagelophobia, the fear of being ridiculed - to his advantage, cultivating an air of quiet steel, rather in the way that Charles Saatchi or Kate Moss have long traded on the intriguing power of saying nothing at all. </p> <p>Osborne has betrayed himself as the opposite - a blabbermouth who picked a fight with Mandelson on ground on which he was so compromised that a regional sales rep whose Vauxhall Astra glovebox contains a copy of The Art of War could tell you that defeat was inevitable. Even more staggering, for a chap who has known Rothschild since they were at prep school, was Osborne's inability to realise that leaking details of conversations that took place while he was enjoying Rothschild's hospitality would incense his host. </p> <p>Corfugate is primarily a tale of club rules broken. Not literal clubs, in most cases - though Bilderberg Group meetings have been mentioned - but the deck-shoed networks of the super-powerful, who sweetly allow politicians the illusion of being allowed to run things, and even to start the odd war, so long as they think it will bring down the price of oil. Most of the politicians ever allowed within a sniff of this world learn its mores, just as Mandelson has. They are pathetically grateful to be asked to Rupert Murdoch's annual retreats; they allow Murdoch's son-in-law Matthew Freud to buy them \u00a334,000-worth of private jet travel, as Cameron did on this same Greek trip; and they don't do anything so vulgar as to mention in the register of members' interests that they had a meeting with Mr Murdoch while they were there.</p> <p>This is nothing new. John Campbell's brilliant biography of Margaret Thatcher chronicles forensically the manner in which Thatcher treated Murdoch as a powerful Reagan-like friend and ally, given free access to her, and invited several times to spend Christmas at Chequers. And yet, she never once mentioned Murdoch in her memoirs. </p> <p>Whatever goes on in the rarefied air above democracy will always be politicians' dirty little secret. If it wasn't such a dirty big one, that is. The only mystery is why we seem to restrict use of the word oligarch to Russians. Oleg Deripaska, the man Osborne allegedly solicitied for a donation, is described thusly, though not Mr Murdoch, or indeed Mr Freud. Let us end this reticence. What greater credit to our meritocracy, after all, than an erstwhile popstar press officer's rise to princemaker?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:marina.hyde@theguardian.com\">marina.hyde@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Welcome to nerds' corner, and yet another small print criticism of a trivial act of borderline dubiousness which will lead to distorted evidence, irrational decisions, and bad outcomes in what I like to call \"the real world\".</p> <p>So the ClinPsyc blog (<a href=\"http://clinpsyc.blogspot.com\">clinpsyc.blogspot.com</a>) has spotted that the drug company Lilly has published identical data on duloxetine - a newish antidepressant drug - twice over, in two entirely separate scientific papers.</p> <p>The first article is from the January 2008 edition of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, a study which concludes that the \"switch to duloxetine was associated with significant improvements in both emotional and painful physical symptoms of depression\". The second concluded the same thing.</p> <p>ClinPsyc went through both papers and checked all the numbers in the data tables, finding that they were essentially identical. A few different subscales were reported in each paper, and the emphasis in the second is more on pain than depression, but other than that, this is identical data.</p> <p>There are several reasons why this is interesting. Firstly, duplicate publication distorts a reader's impression of how much evidence is out there. If you think there are two trials showing that something works, then obviously that's much more impressive than if there's just one. \"Of course I prescribe it,\" you can hear the doctors say. \"I've seen two trials showing that it works.\"</p> <p>I got on to the lead author of the paper, who explained that the second paper expanded more on the \"pain\" aspects of the results. That is slightly fair enough. He also claimed that the second paper referenced the first. </p> <p>This is true in the strictest sense of the phrase: it did indeed make reference to its existence as a previous experiment, but it gave no indication that this was the same experiment, and for the reader, without going forensic on the numbers, there was no way to know that the data here was all from that previous study, and largely, simply, reproduced. It looked like two studies. It just did.</p> <p>Duplicate publication can also distort the results of \"meta-analyses\", big studies where the results of lots of trials are brought together into one big spreadsheet. </p> <p>Because then, if you can't spot what's duplicated, some evidence is actually counted twice in the numerical results. This is why it is more acceptable to publish duplicates if you at least acknowledge that you have done so. By way of example, I am being clear that I will now rehash a paragraph I wrote several years ago on the work of Dr Martin Tramer.</p> <p>Tramer was looking at the efficacy of a nausea drug called ondansetron, and noticed that lots of the data seemed to be replicated: the results for many individual patients had been written up several times, in slightly different forms, in apparently different studies, in different journals. </p> <p>Crucially, data which showed the drug in a better light were more likely to be duplicated than the data which showed it to be less impressive, and overall this led to a 23% overestimate of the drug's efficacy.</p> <p>But the other thing to notice about this duloxetine experiment is that its design made the Durham fish oil \"trial\" look like a work of genius. There was no control group, and it simply looks at whether pain improves after swapping to duloxetine from a previous antidepressant (either instantly, or with a gradual crossover of prescriptions, which might induce a vague sense that one thing is somehow being compared with another).</p> <p>You don't need to be a professor of clinical trial methodology to recognise that some people's pain will improve anyway, under those conditions, regardless of what's in the pill (and regardless of whether prescriptions are tapered into each other), through a combination of the placebo effect, and the fact that sometimes, in fact quite often, things like pain do just get better with time.</p> <p>And this might have been a worthwhile study to do if you had good grounds to believe that duloxetine really did improve physical pain in depression - as Lilly has claimed for a while - and you just needed to work out the best dosing regime. But a meta-analysis published earlier this year looked at all the evidence for that claim. Its title is Duloxetine Does Not Relieve Painful Physical Symptoms in Depression: A Meta-Analysis.</p> <p>Nobody knows how common duplicate publication is in academia. Two days after ClinPsyc published its story The MacGuffin (<a href=\"http://chekhovsgun.blogspot.com\">chekhovsgun.blogspot.com</a>) found an identical story around a different drug. Just from mentioning this story I've picked up another from my friend Will in the next room. These are afterthoughts by academics, water cooler comments, but once posted on the internet they become searchable, and notable, and slightly embarrassing.</p> <p>\u2022 Please send your bad science to <a href=\"mailto:bad.science@theguardian.com\">bad.science@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Geoff Garrod is hacking open a shotgun cartridge on the table. With the tip of his huntsman's knife - which resembles a toy in his huge, weathered hands - he flips out a plug of white plastic. To one side lies the gunpowder charge (which I immediately sniff, hoping for the satisfying whiff of a firework, but it is disappointingly odourless). On the other is the shot - about 250 to 300 tiny lead pellets, each roughly double the size of a pinhead. \"If they hit the bird,\" he explains, \"they'll obviously kill it.\"</p> <p>He disappears and returns with a Beretta 12-bore, double-barrelled shotgun, which he cracks open to expose the breech ends of the barrels. At close quarters it is undeniably an object of great beauty, with its oil-finished hardwood butt and intricately engraved mechanism. Patiently he explains the function of the chokes, nozzles fitted to the end of each barrel that control the spread and subsequent velocity of the lead pellets when they are fired. </p> <p>Garrod is showing me this in response to what seems, retrospectively, a daft question about the chances of getting hit on the head by falling bullets during a shoot. \"It does happen,\" he says, as gamely as a gamekeeper can. \"They don't hurt, it's just a lead pellet. It's amazing, really, that very few people have actually felt them.\"</p> <p>Shooting has always been a passion of his, encouraged by his father - a gamekeeper before him - while he was growing up on a farm only a dozen or so miles from where he now lives. \"When we used to go out for a Sunday joint, it wasn't to Tesco - it was round the fields with a gun for a rabbit or a hare,\" he recalls. </p> <p>It's probably just as well, since his gamekeeper's duties require that he take a gun out with him every day.

It's unlikely that you'd need Loyd Grossman's services to figure out who lives in a house like this.</p> <p>Mindful of drawing unwanted attention from anti-bloodsports minded Guardian readers, the estate's owner has asked me not to divulge its name or exact location. \"We are at the rough end of it and it does go on,\" Garrod says, a touch conspiratorially, \"hunt sabs and so on. Although I'm proud of what I do, I have to be a bit careful.\" </p> <p>Given the present-day popularity of free-range and organically reared meat, might they be more bothered by hordes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall devotees trying to buy cheap partridge? He smiles doubtfully - but still, it feels like the lines of debate surrounding this most emotive of issues are becoming increasingly blurred. Is it becoming easier to justify, for example, the indulgence of rearing and shooting animals for sport, when the pursuit also provides a nutritious, wild-reared source of food? Or how about the argument - close to Garrod's heart - that managing land and controlling certain species of wildlife can also benefit the survival prospects of many others? </p> <p>\"A lot of people don't really understand what we do,\" he says. \"The bottom line is, I'm not going to deny it, we're rearing game birds to shoot. People think we're murdering bastards, just killing things. But they don't see the benefits of it ... you're more likely to see songbirds out on a shoot than you are on non-managed land, where the predators at the top of the tree are the ones surviving.\"</p> <p>The thing is, in order to keep conditions just right for shooting game and admiring songbirds, Garrod finds that quite a lot of other animals living on the estate require shooting too. The law prohibits the killing of any birds of prey or badgers, leaving the fox as his public enemy No 1. \"They damage game birds, which nest on the ground,\" he explains. \"But you've got skylark, ducks, plovers, all nesting on the ground also. They'll never survive if you don't control foxes. I'll never kill the last fox on this land in a million years. But by controlling them you're giving everything else a chance.\"</p> <p>Garrod controls foxes by shooting them after dark, a tricky business as he only gets one shot - and if he misses they are, quite reasonably, not liable to hang about. In recent times the estate has not played host to traditional fox hunting - now banned, of course. But he is defensive of the practice, insisting it was the most humane and effective way of dealing with them, \"because the fox got killed instantly. No fox ever got away from a pack of hounds.\"</p> <p>Also needing to be controlled are squirrels and rats (they debark trees), magpies and crows (eat other birds' eggs) and rabbits and deer (overpopulate and damage crops). It sounds like a delicate - not to mention messy - rearrangement of the wildlife equilibrium. \"It is,\" he agrees. \"By controlling foxes we've now got a nice population of hares. That brings trouble because then you've got poachers and hare coursers coming in.\" He shrugs. \"But that's the price you pay.\"</p> <p>Enforcing this regime can be gruelling work, he explains to me as the latest in a seemingly endless parade of friendly dogs pads into the room and nuzzles my leg. \"Tonight I'm going out deer shooting from five till dark, then back for something to eat, then out again shooting rabbits, back at 11, have a kip, up at six, hang up all the rabbits shot from the night before, tray them up for the game dealer, then go off and feed everything.\" He pauses for breath. \"It's just continuous.\"</p> <p>Garrod is at pains to point out that all the animals killed - including deer and rabbits - are sold for consumption, except for the vermin, which are buried. He thinks people have big misconceptions about what happens to hunted game. \"We eat it!\" he protests. \"It's as simple as that. You won't get anything more organic than a pheasant or a partridge. We supplement their diet with wheat but the rest is berries from the hedgerow or whatever.\"</p> <p>When we meet, Garrod is making final preparations for the first pheasant shoot of the year, the partridge season having already been in full swing since September. It's the culmination of six months' hard graft for him that started back in April, when the first eggs were collected and delivered to the local hatchery. </p> <p>Once the birds are hatched, he returns them to the estate and rears them in huts until they are six or seven weeks old, at which point they are transferred to the woods. \"It sounds pretty young,\" he explains quickly, \"but in human lifespan terms, they're about 17 or 18. It's like kicking a teenager out of the house.\"</p> <p>In the woods, the birds live in release pens, where their wings are clipped every four weeks or so to preventing them from unsportingly flying off before the season begins. Each year he reckons he breeds a couple of thousand pheasant and around 500 partridges, \"which sounds like a lot, but you're releasing them over 3,500 acres,\" he points out.</p> <p>On the day of the shoot, Garrod dons his tweeds and leads the party, organising the hunters and instructing them on safety. \"We go where I say we go and we shoot what I say we shoot,\" he says, coming over all sergeant-majorly. Once they reach the designated spot, he leads his team of a dozen or so \"beaters\" - mainly local pensioners, lured by the prospect of some extra cash and as much game as they can carry home - through the woods, with the objective of driving as many birds as possible up and over the guns, to meet their lead-shot-spattered fate. </p> <p>It's a life and perhaps even a dish not to everyone's tastes - but there's no doubt that Garrod sees the conservational aspect of his work as a strong mitigating factor. So much so, in fact, that he calls me a few days later to emphasise again how the grain he leaves in hedgerows to attract game birds in the shooting season is also a welcome source of winter food for songbirds.</p> <p>\"When the old boss died, about 15 years ago, there were discussions as to what the memorial would be,\" he recalls. \"Would it be a bench or a fountain? <br>In the end we decided to put in a wood, 14-acres of beech, ash, sweet chestnut, hazel, you name it. That will be there forever. Think of all the wildlife that will benefit from that. Because we shoot.\"</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Pay </strong>\"You don't go into it for the money. An average gamekeeper might earn \u00a312-15,000pa, plus a house and vehicle. But it varies.\"</p> <p><strong>Hours </strong>\"With any livestock, you have to feed them, it's a 24/7 job. The busiest time of the year is August to October - that's 24/8, there's never enough time to get everything done. The quietest is February to March, when the shooting season ends. We go on holiday then.\"</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance </strong>\"It's a complete way of life. If we have to go shopping I might take a few hours off then carry on working later. A gamekeeper needs a good wife, and Karen is exceptional.\"</p> <p><strong>Best thing </strong>\"I'm my own boss, out in the countryside, me on my own ... that's how I want it.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing </strong>\"There are times in the winter when it's dark and rainy and I've still got to go out and feed the birds.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 24 December 2008 to correct the homophone; \"That brings trouble because then you've got the poachers and hare coarsers coming in\".</p>",
  "<p>Tom Jones has two recurring nightmares. In the first, he is wrongfully accused of murder. In the second, he has hidden a body in the attic, the house has just been sold and the body is about to be discovered. He wakes up in a bath of sweat. The nightmares confused him for years. \"I haven't killed anybody. I've never wanted to kill anybody. I've tried to analyse it, and I think, since I started making hit records, I've thought, 'Jesus Christ, this is the best thing that's ever happened to me.' But always you think this is going to fall apart. Something will happen. There is a skeleton in the closet.\" He stops. \"Which there isn't. But in my mind I think they're going to find that out, and that's going to finish me.\"</p> <p>Jones, now 68, has a lovely way of telling stories, as if every thought has hit him for the first time.</p> <p>Perhaps there's another reason for the nightmares. His biggest hit, Green, Green Grass Of Home, was about a man facing execution. Another huge single, Delilah, tells the story of a jealous boyfriend killing his girlfriend. His new album is called 24 Hours and the title track is about another man on death row \u2014 though it can just as easily be read as the sombre reflections of an elderly man looking into the abyss. It's a landmark album for Jones \u2014 his most personal, and the first for which he has a joint writing credit on most of the songs.</p> <p>We first meet in a London hotel. He is wearing black, as he often does. Black polo neck, black trousers, black shoes, strange black hair that looks as if it could be woven from acrylic, and black goatee. He is accompanied by his son and daughter-in-law, Mark and Donna Woodward, the svengalis behind his renaissance over the past 20 years. Mark looks like a greyer version of his father \u2014 how Jones might look if he'd chosen a more sober career. Jones also introduces me to a handsome elderly man with snow white hair, Don Archell, his personal assistant, and to the singer Cerys Matthews, with whom he duetted on the hit record Baby, It's Cold Outside. Jones orders the first of his vodka martinis, and he's off.</p> <p>If there's one thing Tom Jones enjoys as much as singing, it's chatting. He's seen so much, met so many people, had such a lucky life, of course he wants to talk about it, he says. He loves being interviewed. \"Look, if I go into a pub, I'm doing an interview because people want to know things. And I love my life, I love my achievements, I love talking about it . If somebody wasn't asking me, I'd go and find someone and say, 'Guess what I did?!' It's a Celtic thing. The people in Wales, they all talk, and I love it.\"</p> <p>So he talks about drinking with Robbie Williams' dad in Los Angeles, his grandson's skills on the ski slopes , the time Otis Redding told him that soul singers try to sing like Jones. \"I said to Otis, 'You're joking \u2014 I'm trying to sound like you.'\" Jones spent so many years in Vegas, singing epic ballads, that it is easy to forget he was one of the great white soul singers. Go to YouTube and watch him battling it out note for note with Stevie Wonder on Superstition, Aretha Franklin on See Saw and Tina Turner on Nutbush City Limits, and you see just how raw, radical and soulful he was.</p> <p>He grew up in Pontypridd in a Welsh mining community. His earliest memories are of tugging on his mother's sleeve at family weddings, asking when he could sing, and her saying he had to wait to be invited. He was five or six, and impatient. Even then, he says, when he got up, he was aware of the effect he had on the little girls. They made eyes at him, asked him what school he went to. He can't remember his voice being much different \u2014 even then, he wanted to belt them out. \"Some kids, they sing very high and then their balls drop and their voice drops. I can't remember that ever happening to me. It was higher, but it didn't change dramatically.\"</p> <p>He was useless at school. Not interested. He thinks he was slightly dyslexic, but says he might be making excuses for himself \u2014 perhaps he was just thick. Even on the sports field, he couldn't concentrate \u2014 sure, he'd play rugby because he had to, but all the while he'd be watching the time, telling himself in a few minutes he could be down the shops buying himself an air gun or at home singing. He boxed, but didn't much care for getting hit.</p> <p>At 13, he contracted tuberculosis. He was off school for two years, most of the time spent in bed. Thank God for TB, he says. If it hadn't been for the illness, he might have ended up down the mines, like his father. \"The doctor said to my parents, ' Whatever you do, you can't put this boy in a coal mine because he has weak lungs .' And the weird thing is, with weak lungs I've become a fuckin' singer.\"</p> <p>The illness changed his attitude to life. \"When I used to get up for an hour a day, I would stand at the front door and see my mates playing, going up the hills. They'd shout, 'All right, Tom' but I couldn't get out the door. There was a lamp-post at the end of our street, and I'd look at it and think, once I can walk from this door to that lamp-post, I will never complain about another thing in my life. And that was it. And if I do, if the thought ever enters my mind, I see that lamp-post.\"</p> <p>He returned to school for a year and left at 15 to work as a labourer's mate. \"Hod carrying, mixing cement. Up and down ladders. Good, strong legs.\" A year later, he was married to Linda, living in her mother's house with baby Mark. They wanted more children, but a miscarriage left her infertile.</p> <p>Fast-forward another year and Jones is doing shifts on building sites by day and singing at working men's clubs by nights. The women loved him, but it was the fellas who really came to watch and judge. Big, tough, emotional men, they made for a demanding audience. \"On Sunday nights it was men only. You'd have to make sure you put a bunch of ballads in there. The men loved them. Especially in Wales.\"</p> <p>All the time he really wanted to sing edgier songs. First, there was the new rock'n'roll of Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis, then there was the blues. \"I was liking black singers without realising. And the blues. Big Bill Broonzy. I heard this song, 'If you was white, you's all right, if you was brown, stick around, but if you's black, oh brother, get back' and I thought what a great line that is.\" Jones' voice is lilting, even by Welsh standards, and every few minutes he breaks into song to illustrate his point. He can't help himself.</p> <p>It was when he got himself a band, and started to play rock'n'roll and blues and soul, that women went crazy for him. By now, Linda didn't like turning up to his shows. They made her feel uncomfortable, and she had Mark to look after, anyway. \"She said, 'Go on, I know what those girls are like and I don't want to see it. As long as you come home here.' So that's what happened.\"</p> <p>In his mid-20s in 1964, Jones, still known as Tom Woodward (his mother's name was Jones), headed off for London, championed by the people of Pontypridd. All he had was his looks, the moves he had learned as a teenager and the voice. \"My mates would say, 'You can sing, you've got to go to London,you've got to show these fuckers how to put it together.'\" He hated leaving Linda and Mark at home, Linda working at a battery factory to make ends meet \u2014 he considered it demeaning to be supported by a woman. Working in the mines or factories of Pontypridd was drudgery, certainly not a career. He promised himself that when he became successful, he would ensure that his family never had to work again. One of the things of which he is most proud is that he was able to retire his father from the mines at 50.</p> <p>Three days later, on Saturday, we meet at Bethnal Green Working Men's Club in east London, where he is having his photograph taken. It's a throwback to his early days \u2014 a huge red heart on the stage, carpets that stink of stale beer, and a few elderly men dotted around supping on pints. Jones is here with his mini entourage \u2014 Don, Mark and Donna, and their ageing staffordshire bull terrier, Leroy. Leroy and Jones are not dissimilar \u2014 both have been round the block a few times, yet exude a puppyish verve. Leroy likesnothing more than lying on his back and being given a good tickle. I would imagine the same could be said for Jones.</p> <p>Jones is all in black again \u2014 this time in a frilly shirt rather than polo neck. After six decades in the business, he still gets self-conscious when having his picture taken. He asks if we'd mind leaving the room while he psyches himself up. When we return, he's fiddling with his silver crucifix, trying on a new shirt \u2014 white this time \u2014 and singing along to one of the songs. After the shoot, he fancies a drink. Two vodka martinis, please. He asks if I went on somewhere else the other night. He and Cerys had a bit of dinner and a few drinks, he says. \"She left about 12.30 to 1am.\" But she was going to leave at 8pm? \"Exactly!\" he says with delight.</p> <p>Matthews later tells me she doesn't get much chance to go out now that she's a mother of two. \"Tom is very persuasive. We had so much fun \u2014 we didn't stop laughing. He's a riot and a good friend, as well as being an old school gentleman.\" She has never sung with anybody like him, she says. \"It's the best feeling in the world. His instincts are natural, his passion is absolute. I once asked him what his ideal day would be and said don't let it be about music. 'Well, it couldn't be my ideal day if I couldn't get up and do a show,' he said.\"</p> <p>When Jones came to London in 1964, he hooked up with aspiring manager and song writer Gordon Mills. It was Mills who suggested changing the name to Jones \u2014 very Welsh, very laddish, very Henry Fielding. Six months on, Jones felt he was wasting his time recording demos for stars to turn into hits. He made a demo of a song written by Mills called It's Not Unusual and was told it was going to be recorded by a young singer called Sandie Shaw. He knew he'd done the song more than justice, that it was perfect for him, and decided he would return to Pontypridd if he couldn't make it his. \"Thank God Sandie Shaw listened to the demo and said, ' Whoever's singing this song, it's his song', so God bless her.\"</p> <p>Another vodka martini. A toast to Sandie Shaw. Jones has an incredible memory for dates. He'd do brilliantly on Mastermind with Tom Jones as his specialist subject. \"I recorded It's Not Unusual on November 11 1964, it came out on January 22 1965 and it was number one by March 1, which was St David's Day. Tremendous!\"</p> <p>There are a couple of things people know about Tom Jones: he has always been something of a ladies' man \u2014 women throw their knickers at him \u2014 and he is still married to the woman he wed at 16. It's not that he boasts about his conquests; others do that for him. There have been countless kiss'n'tells, most famously Mary Wilson of the Surpremes who claimed they had enjoyed a two-year fling; there was the paternity case (he paid out because, he says, he could not prove the boy was not his son \u2014 there has been no relationship); and there have been the former associates who have done the dirty on him.</p> <p>For the first time on the new album, he addresses his infidelities in the remarkable confessional The Road, when he sings that however far and often he has strayed, he has always returned home. It is both a love song and an apology, isn't it? \"Well, I never admit to anything, you know what I mean.\" I can't help laughing. Tom, you admit plenty in this song.</p> <p>He recites the lyrics as if standing at the pulpit. \"'I have felt weakness when I was strong, felt sweetness when I was wrong.' Linda wouldn't say to me, 'What d'you mean by that?' No, she wouldn't do that. The thing that she likes more than anything else is, 'But the road always leads back to you.' And that 's the truth. I will never leave my wife. It never entered my mind.\" They've been apart a lot, he says. \"But we are still in love with one another. You know, we're not sexually like we were, but we are still in tune with one another, we can still have fun with one another, we still talk. She's still the Welsh girl I married.\"</p> <p>He says Linda is shy, agoraphobic. When he has well-known friends around, she hides. I also heard she once beat him up after hearing about one of his affairs. \"Oh yeah!\" he says, almost enthusiastically. \"She's actually thrown things at me.\" Sometimes, he says, she settles for harsh words. \"The funniest thing is, we were having a bit of a barny one night in LA \u2014 sometimes it can start off really nice, a nice dinner, back to the music room, put on the old records that we used to dance to when we were teenagers, and it's all lovely, lovely, lovely, and then it becomes, 'Well, what about when you did this?' \"Would that be about Mary Wilson? \"Exactly. Things like that. So she said, 'Let me tell you something, but you've got to stand there, and you've got to promise me that you will not try and get hold of me.' And I thought, 'Jesus, what's she going to tell me \u2014 that she's been with an old friend of mine or what?' So I'm expecting the worst, and we're both well oiled by this point. 'OK, come on, what is it?' She says, 'If you couldn't sing, you wouldn't have a friend in the world' and runs out of the room. Well, I fell on the floor in a heap. She thought that was the worst thing she could ever say to me \u2014 I thought it was hilarious.\"</p> <p>Does he think there's any truth in it? \"Maybe! No, nah.\" I ask if she has had affairs. \"Not as far as I know \u2026 Best not to go into it. We don't discuss it, never have.\" He pauses. \"That has never been discussed either, if you know what I mean \u2014 the not discussing it. Should we have another?\"</p> <p>I'm beginning to sink into a happy blur, while Jones is remembering more and more dates: 1968, Copacabana, New York \u2014 the first time he had knickers thrown at him. \"There was a supper club, and the singer sang at the same level as the table and chairs, right on the floor. And the more people you drew into the club, the smaller the area in which you performed \u2014 like some of the northern clubs. At one point I'm performing in a tiny area and I'm sweating \u2014 I was always a good sweater. So because they'd had dinner, they had napkins on the table, so they see me sweating and hand me their napkins, I hand them back and they'd keep them. So this one woman stood up \u2014 up with the dress, down with the drawers. Took 'em off and handed them to me.\" What did you do? \"I wiped my brow and said, 'Sweetheart, watch you don't catch cold.' Because you always learn in working men's clubs, no matter what happens, you've got to try to make some fun out of it.\" When he went to Vegas for the first time later that year, the women started throwing hotel keys as well.</p> <p>In the 70s, his income tax rose to 98 %; Jones and Linda packed their bags and moved to Los Angeles, where they still live. By now, he was known for his tight trousers, hairy chest, snake hips and libidinous thrust as much as for the voice. Was he as horny as he appeared to be, or was it an act? Hell, no, he says, appalled, it was \u2014 is \u2014 for real. Was any other performer as sexually charged as him? \"Well, the only one really was Elvis Presley. I knew him very well, and he said I see in you what I feel myself. You see, Elvis was a macho man, he was a good-looking fella, but he was still strong. That's why he was always doing karate in those movies, it was a male thing that he felt. So, not to pick on Mick Jagger, but [Elvis] said how the fuck \u2026 what do people see in the Beatles and the Stones and these British bands? He said thank heaven for you coming out of Britain, that you feel the same thing. I said, 'Well, you are partly to blame, it was watching you \u2026 you rubbed off on me so much that you gave me confidence to do it.'\" Does he get excited on stage? \"Oh yeah!\" Sexually excited? \"Well, you don't get physically aroused, because you concentrate so much.\"</p> <p>I ask if it is true that at his shows he was provided with both a dressing room and a love-making suite. He looks sheepish, and stutters into a non sequitur. \"Well, well \u2026 I \u2026 no ! Well, we can't go into that \u2026 but I do love to drink. Though not before a show \u2026 \"</p> <p>His friendship with Elvis provided him with some of his most cherished memories. They never performed together publicly, but they often went to Elvis's hotel suite for a sing-song when they were both playing Vegas . \"He'd say, 'I'll get the group up and we'll do something' and I'd already done two shows. There were two songs he loved at the time. A song Kris Kristofferson wrote called Why Me and Roberta Flack's Killing Me Softly. Once he latched on to something, he wouldn't let it go. So we're at the suite, comparing gospel I learned in Wales with gospel he learned in Mississippi. We must have sung The Old Rugged Cross a dozen times with an electric piano and his vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations. He'd say, 'D'you think I'd like Wales, Tom, if I came over ?' I said, 'You'd love the male voice choirs.' I had this vision of taking him up the Rhondda valley and having him sing with all the choirs.\"</p> <p>For the last two years of Presley's life, Jones never saw him. He knew he'd become addicted to diet pills and had turned in on himself, but he didn't know how desperate he was. In 1977, Presley died and Jones still regrets that he didn't make more of an effort to help him. Towards the end he had stopped taking calls. \"I didn't know Elvis was sick. I thought he was just getting lazy \u2014 he was getting heavy and pushed people away from him. The first thing that hit me after he died was I should have gone and seen him. Priscilla called me, and said, 'When you show up, you give him a spark. He's got this competitive spark in him again.' So I thought maybe I could have given him that shot again. Maybe.\"</p> <p>Presley's death coincided with a downturn in Jones' fortunes. He came to be regarded as a kitsch crooner, a parody of his former self, and went without another hit in Britain for 15 years. He continued to sell out shows, but the venues were smaller. The knickers and door keys began to pall. People stopped talking about the voice. \"The thing that I don't like about it, it became a joke. People go, 'Oh Tom Jones, knickers.' You want another?\"</p> <p>Two more vodka martinis.</p> <p>\"Since then I've thought it's positive, it's not as if they're throwing bottles at you. But it did become a bit of a joke. Girls would run to the front even when I'm doing a ballad. You're trying to create a mood, doing the Green, Green Grass Of Home, and underwear lands straight on you, and everybody laughs. I once did a radio show with Howard Stern in New York and Roger Daltrey was going in after me, and he said, 'I just had to walk through a room full of knickers back there, I thought you must be on the show.' And I thought, ' Oh fuck, it's even got to Roger Daltrey' \u2014 all he could think to say about me was not love the way you sing or hate the way you sing, but knickers.\"</p> <p>I'm staring at Jones through my martini glass. His teeth are so white. \"Oh yeah, they were capped,\" he says. His hair \u2014 so black.\"Oh yeah, that's dyed.\" His skin \u2014 so firm. \"Oh yeah, I had the fat removed from under my chin. That's basically why I wear the goatee because it covers the scar. If I went for laser treatment, I could get rid of it, but I thought, fuck it, I'll wear a goatee. And my nose, that was straightened. Then, with the eyes, they took the heaviness out of the lids. Thank God the plastic surgeon said you've got to be careful because you've got to look like you, you can't look like someone else.\" A toast. To the plastic surgeon.</p> <p>In 1986, Gordon Mills, his manager, died. Jones was devastated. He had lost a close friend, and his career was in a trough. And that was when his son Mark came into his own. Ever since Mark had been in his late teens, he had toured with his father, helping out with the lights and design, even the song choices. Mark himself was a fine singer, but he got red-light fever if he had to perform \u2014 the studio light went on and he lost his bottle. But what he loved more than anything was dreaming up strategies that might revive his father's career. \"Mark said to me, 'Well, what do we do now for a manager?' and I said, 'Why don't you have a go?' Donna, his wife, was Bill Cosby's secretary and she was always talking about things she thought I should be doing, so I said, 'Why don't you both do it? We can do it all together \u2026 '\"</p> <p>Mark looked at Jones' act \u2014 the knickers and the tight trousers and the old repertoire \u2014 and told his father that there was a good reason people didn't talk about the singing any more. \" When I see those old clips, I see why people didn't take me more seriously, vocally \u2014 cos your trousers are too tight. Not tight in the waist,\" he says delicately. \"And I've always had big legs, so where are you going to put all that stuff. So there it was. When I look at it, I think no wonder people went, 'Oh!' when I came on stage.\"</p> <p>Mark realised that what had been problematic for Mills \u2014 Jones' versatility \u2014 could prove a virtue. If Jones could sing anything, why not hire trendy producers and record some of the contemporary songs he performed in his shows. In 1988, Jones had a massive hit with the Prince song Kiss, produced by techno pop stars Art Of Noise. A new young audience was entranced by the voice. \"There was no baggage for them. You want another?\"</p> <p>A toast. To Mark, Prince, Tom's stamina and his not-so-tight trousers.</p> <p>Monday morning, 8.15am, BBC radio studios in London. Jones isn't used to early mornings, but you wouldn't know it. He fair bounds in \u2014 all in black, new jumper . \"You go on anywhere, on Saturday?\" he says.</p> <p>No, straight home, I tell him. And you? \"Ah, nothing much. Don and I had a meal, and some red wine.\" A second later he realises he's forgotten something. \"And a few champagnes. Have I got time for the khazi?\" They tell him he's due on any second. Ever the professional, Jones holds it in. Wogan and Jones \u2014 both of them knighted \u2014 are chatting way in the studio. Meanwhile, Don Archell is reminiscing about drinking way back when \u2026 \"Oh yes, he was up there with the Richards in the old days \u2014 Burton and Harris. I couldn't keep up with him, no way. I don't know how he did it. In Vegas, we used to be up till 7-8am. I'm glad it's not like that any more.\" Don still accompanies him around the world \u2014 200 shows a year. Home for Jones is LA, home for Don is Luton. \"Mind you, I'm hardly ever there.\"</p> <p>What's Jones like as a man? \"As you see him. Every day. Never changes. Same mood. Never loses it. So laid back.\" Wogan says it's amazing that after all these years Jones is so fashionable, with artists such as Duffy and Mark<br>Ronson keen to recapture the retro feel. The funny thing is that at his peak in the 60s and early 70s, Jones was never really cool \u2014 not like today. In 2000, he released Reload, an album of covers recorded with other artists and bands including Robbie Williams and the Stereophonics. It went on to sell four million \u2014 his biggest album. In 2005, he was estimated to be worth \u00a3175m.</p> <p>I ask Mark, who is the boss \u2014 him or his dad? \"Well, it's a proper relationship.\" Does it feel like a traditional father/son relationship? \"It depends what you're doing. We were always friends, but if we weren't a proper manager/artist relationship at some point in the day, it wouldn't have worked for long.\" Does he have to make the decisions for Jones? \"He relies on it. I know what he can sing.\"</p> <p>Jones is talking about the new album. He loves the fact that, along with the more reflective songs, it's a statement about the here and now \u2014 that he's still around, and plans to be for some time. The opening song, I'm Alive, is a dance track every bit as celebratory as its title. He directs me to the lyrics of<br>another song, Seasons. \"What I like about that song is that I walk on and 'make my memories'. I'm still making my memories, I'm not just thinking of old memories.\"</p> <p>A week later Jones is on Jools Holland's BBC2 show, Later. No sign of Leroy, but Mark is on stage giving his father instructions. Profile to profile, deep in discussion, they look as if they could be auditioning for a Welsh Sopranos. As the other acts perform, Jones stands in front of his band, straight-backed and still, waiting his turn. When he gets his chance, there is a transformation \u2014 the blood seems to be flowing faster. There's a technical hitch, and he is asked to start again. \"Do we have to stop?\" he pleads. I'm reminded of the little boy tugging at his mother's sleeves. He sings three songs from the new album, and at the end of each his face creases into ecstasies.</p> <p>Back in the changing room, he's buzzing. He thinks his voice now is better than it ever has been. \"I've only lost a little bit on the high end, thank God, and I've gained a tremendous amount of bottom end. I couldn't have sung 24 Hours in that low key when I was in my 20s. And it's become richer. When you experience life, you read more into things. When you're younger, you're charging, and you think, 'Right, I'll hit the shit out of this, smacking everything.' I still do to an extent, but there's pathos.\"</p> <p>It's notable how many times, over the days, he's thanked God. Well, he says, he was raised a Presbyterian and though he doesn't attend chapel, he has never lost his faith. \"I pray every night by the bed before I go to sleep. I say, 'Look after my family and my friends and band members and all the people who work with me, and thank you for giving me this voice. Please may I keep it for as long as I live.'\" </p> <p>\u2022 Jones' new album, 24 Hours is out on November 17</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, confirmed a toughening of Labour's immigration policy yesterday by indicating for the first time that the government is to use its new Australian-style points-based system to restrict the growth in Britain's population. Woolas signalled the shift in emphasis during a BBC Today programme interview yesterday given to counter the accusation that he had been gagged by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, after his withdrawal from this week's edition of BBC TV's Question Time.</p> <p>The points-based immigration system, which has been phased in from April, has been advocated as a flexible way of responding to the changing labour needs of the economy. An independent migration advisory committee, packed with labour market economists, has been created to draw up a list of shortage occupations, alongside a forum to advise on the effect of migration on communities and public services.</p> <p>In yesterday's interview Woolas dismissed suggestions that he backed the Tory proposal for a cap on economic migration to Britain, but defended his controversial promise that the government would not allow the UK's population to rise as high as 70 million.</p> <p>\"We are introducing the biggest shake-up in immigration policy for 45 years ... that is based on the points system which allows the government to move the hurdles up and down - the criteria by which people can come into our country to work,\" said Woolas. \"That will allow us to control the population, to answer the worries that Frank Field and Nicholas Soames have been raising. That is not the same as a numerical cap. We don't think that is appropriate.\" Labour's Field and the Conservative Soames have been demanding a \"balanced\" immigration policy of one in and one out.</p> <p>Asked if he stood by his assurance that the government would not let the population rise from its current 61 million to 70 million or more, Woolas replied: \"Yes. The points-based system we are introducing allows governments to influence the numbers of people coming into the country to work, and there are other changes we are making.\"</p> <p>Woolas' tough line on population control has provoked outrage among some groups. It culminated yesterday at a debate at the University of Manchester when a female activist flung a custard pie at his face, scoring a direct hit. The stunned minister left the stage to clean himself up but later returned to the debate. The Manchester No Borders campaign group claimed responsibility for the stunt.</p> <p>The latest report from the Office of National Statistics shows a rise in the birth rate, particularly among foreign-born mothers in the UK. Immigration is playing a smaller role, with its contribution down from 72% in 2001 to 52% last year.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives yesterday attempted to play down the revelation that David Cameron had a discreet dinner with the media mogul Rupert Murdoch on a yacht in the Aegean.</p> <p>Cameron had already declared in the parliamentary Register of Members' Interests that he had taken three free trips in a private jet for his family courtesy of Murdoch's son-in-law, Matthew Freud, in August. What he had not revealed was that the purpose of two of the flights was to attend a private dinner with Murdoch.</p> <p>Cameron's office yesterday said it was Freud's idea to invite Cameron for dinner with Murdoch on Freud's yacht, Elizabeth F, preceded by drinks on the Rosehearty, the yacht owned by the Murdoch family, off the coast of the Greek island of Santorini. </p> <p>Freud's largesse began by flying Cameron's wife, Samantha, and their children in his Gulfstream IV jet from London to Istanbul. Cameron joined them for a flight to Santorini, arriving in the early evening in time for drinks on the yacht.</p> <p>Later that night the plane flew the Tory leader's family to Dalaman in Turkey for a sailing holiday with his wife's family to celebrate the 60th birthday of his mother-in-law, Viscountess Astor. The value of the flights was up to \u00a330,000.</p> <p>The Conservatives are not disclosing what was said at the dinner or whether Murdoch, who was on the record two years ago as describing Cameron as \"bright and charming\" but wanting \" some real policies\" before deciding whether he was a real alternative to New Labour, had now warmed to him.</p> <p>The drinks before dinner on the deck of the yacht are said to have included singer Billy Joel, Rebekah Wade, editor of the Sun, and Ben Silverman, co-chairman of the US TV network, NBC Universal.</p> <p>The Tories insisted Cameron had done nothing wrong and a spokeswoman for the party leader said: \"Everything in connection to August 16 has been fully and properly declared.\" </p> <p>They accused the Independent, which broke the story, of \"a desperate attempt to make something out of nothing\".</p>",
  "<p>When I was in New York at the beginning of the year (how glamorous I sound! I'm going to say that more often, especially as only the regular reader[s] of this column and the man who accompanied me will know how I had to be dragged there, a tiny, sweating ball of fear and nascent recriminations, and spent most of the three weeks edging down the streets, hugging the walls of the towering buildings and refusing to cross the enormous roads), I paid a visit to Staten Island to see historic Richmond town.</p> <p>This is a collection of about 15 buildings dating from the 1700s onwards. They aren't all originally Richmond buildings. Some of them were bussed in from elsewhere to plump things out a bit and make preservation and sightseeing easier. This is an attitude I think we would do well to embrace in England. Think how much happier everyone would be if we could divide up the country according to taste and convenience. Reforest the north-west, split everything from 1500 to 1950 between the top right and bottom left quadrants, and dump all the modern stuff into the south-east on the grounds that once the Olympic planners have shat all over Stratford, you might as well finish off the job. Natives can live in and tourists can visit the quarter that most pleases them and our new streamlined efficiency will make us Top Nation once again. </p> <p>But that is a dream for another day. My story continues on Staten Island, where I met a real-life cooper, who was working away with real-life 19th-century tools to make barrels, stools, rolling pins and everything else for which your inner Laura Ingalls Wilder has ever hankered. As he planed and turned and whittled before an enraptured audience, he told us how, when the western states were being settled, laws were brought in to stop people burning down their log cabins when they left (either to press pioneeringly on further west, or because they were big jessies who wanted to return home to the cities full of mod cons such as streets and boughten hats). And why were people setting fire to their homes in such numbers that legislation had to be passed to stop the states being for ever desettled? \"They burned them,\" he said, \"in order to get back the iron nails they had used to build them. Timber was everywhere and any man knew how to make a cabin. But a handful of iron nails - that was precious.\"</p> <p>I had hoped that I would have a few years before this vivid illustration of the changing face of economics, the inherent rather than intrinsic values and, y'know, the mutability of all things, would take on personal relevance. I had hoped to rework it for grandchildren, perhaps, when they are trading hydroponic saplings or oxygen vials for medical care or unscorched land. \"Did I tell you about the time when we would exchange money for clothes at Primark?\" I was planning to chortle. \"Or your futures for a handful of unseasonal asparagus from Taiwan?\"</p> <p>Now look. Just nine months after the ferry deposited me on Staten Island, the world financial system resembles nothing so much as the massive toxic dump for which the NYC outpost is equally justly famed, and I am having to look with narrowed eyes at my own home, trying to work out if it or anything therein could be reconfigured as an asset. Should I sell the copper piping from the boiler for scrap? Is there lead in a 70s roof? Will there ever be a market for used cat litter or old bus tickets? How many nails does a fiscal coffin need? Oh, the iron-y.*</p> <p>*Appalling puns, thankfully, are holding steady at two a penny.</p>",
  "<p>For the sweet-toothed, a job in confectionery - particularly in product-tasting - will be a mouth-watering career option. Who wouldn't want to spend their days munching on chocolate bars in the line of duty? A dream job like this will, undoubtedly, have its downside - the cost of new trousers when all that eating starts to tell on your waistline, for one thing - but it's hard to find too many. There is a variety of jobs in this field, from the scientific side of product development to marketing and getting products on to the shelves. But most of these will probably include a spot of tasting, so it's wise to get a job working on a product you like.</p> <h2>An employer says ...</h2> <p><strong>Mark Sims, graduate recruitment manager, Waitrose (<a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/index.aspx\">waitrose.com</a>)</strong></p> <p>Many people become buyers, working in a category of food such as confectionery, after working in a store or other retail departments such as in supply chain at head office. It's important for buyers to have some experience in a branch or in retail so they have a greater understanding of how the business works. It's likely that \"partners\" (as all Waitrose employees are known) will have various roles throughout the business before moving to become a buyer.</p> <p>We have four graduate schemes in the John Lewis Partnership - two in retail management, one in John Lewis and one in Waitrose. These two schemes give a grounding in managing a large team of people in a high-pressure environment, plus commercial experience.</p> <p>Being a buyer involves the ability to see the wider picture as well as having good analytical skills. You will manage a category of food rather than a team of people. You could find yourself travelling overseas finding inspiration for new product lines, as well as liaising with suppliers and monitoring the production process all the way from the initial idea to seeing the end product on the shelves. It's very rewarding to see a product you have championed flying off the shelves of a Waitrose branch.</p> <h2>An academic says ... </h2> <p><strong>Dr Richard Frazier, head of food and bioprocessing sciences group, University of Reading (<a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/\">reading.ac.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>There are many exciting challenges facing the food industry and there is a constant demand for food science and food technology graduates who possess a strong scientific and technical skill base, combined with an understanding of how to manage consumer issues concerning food safety, quality and nutrition. Graduate careers are among the most rewarding among professional groups in terms of salary and promotion prospects. Recent graduates from Reading have gained employment in all areas of the food industry. </p> <p>We train our graduates in sensory science, which involves designing, performing and evaluating results of sensory panels. This is a key aspect of food quality.</p> <p>Generally speaking, food production companies set up taste panels to monitor the quality of products leaving the factory. This would consist of staff who have been trained to look for certain attributes of the product, and could mean tasting a wide range of products. It is rare that someone would focus on one particular food type or work individually. Taste panels are trained in the specific sensory properties of a food, such as mouth feel, texture and flavour. </p> <p>There is a shortage of food science and food technology graduates leaving UK universities and our graduates can command above-average starting salaries of about \u00a325,000 plus benefits.</p> <h2>A graduate says ...</h2> <p><strong>Gervase Fay, product developer, confectionery department, Sainsbury's (<a href=\"http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/home.htm\">sainsburys.co.uk</a>)</strong></p> <p>I've been at Sainsbury's for a year, and in my current role for two months. My job is to develop confectionery products at fair prices for customers. We look at customer needs and market location, and we go out and get inspiration, develop packaging and design and get the product delivered into stores. I'm involved in all that.</p> <p>We constantly sample products to check they meet our standards. Every week we have a sampling session to check all the products meet the Sainsbury's checklist.</p> <p>I did a degree in retail and my role is to work within the customer department, understanding their needs as well as marketing the product. We have food technicians, who need to have a food science degree, who deal with the technical aspects.</p> <p>What we look for is the right packaging and if the product tastes nice. When we taste the product we look out for the flavours - what it's like to eat, how it feels in the mouth, to bite.</p> <p>I love sampling chocolate - I could do it every day. At the moment, I'm happy to keep learning, but in the future I would like to own a small food store. I don't know what I'll sell, perhaps chocolate.</p> <p>I've just finished working on ensuring all our products have no added flavours and colours, which was a big project for us. I'm now concentrating on Easter. Christmas has been and gone for us. It was strange celebrating Christmas in July.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 28 2008 to correct several misspellings of confectionery as 'confectionary'.</p>",

  "<p>He had served in the army, either as a full-time soldier or as a reservist, for 22 years when he finally decided he wanted out. In 2003, Ari Folman, who had just turned 40, asked his commanders in the Israel Defence Forces to release him from the obligation to do a month's military service every year. They agreed - \"so long as you go to the army therapist and talk about everything you went through\".</p> <p>Folman, already an acclaimed film-maker and screenwriter whose service consisted of writing army information films - \"How to defend yourself from atomic attack, stuff like that\" - began to talk to the counsellor about the most dramatic episode in his military career and one of the most divisive chapters in modern Israeli history: the Lebanon war of 1982. Folman had been just 19. </p> <p>He realised that he had never spoken about the experience before. \"It's not that I had total amnesia about it,\" he says now, \"but I had worked very hard to repress those memories. I had the basic storyline, but there were large holes.\"</p> <p>Around the same time, Folman got a call from a friend, Boaz Rein Buskila, a fellow conscript in 1982. In a bar, the rain hammering outside, Boaz told Folman of a recurring nightmare: a pack of 26 vicious, slavering dogs stampede through a smart Tel Aviv street, upturning chairs, knocking over tables. The dream was connected to Lebanon, Boaz was certain. During the 1982 invasion, when an IDF unit tried to enter a village, their presence was often given away by the howling of dogs: Boaz, deemed too sensitive to kill a man, had been given the task of shooting any dogs on sight - to silence them in advance. He had killed 26, and remembered every one of them. </p> <p>The image had haunted Boaz. Surely Folman had similar memories, similar flashbacks from Beirut? No, Folman realised. Nothing at all. There were vast gaps in his memory - and he became determined to fill them.</p> <p>The result is one of the most extraordinary films of this or any year; it is already bagging prizes across the world and building an Oscar buzz. Waltz With Bashir is a documentary, yet it is animated. It tells a series of true stories, yet unspools like a hallucination. It is gripping, painful, and lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It will surely take its place alongside The Battle Of Algiers and Apocalypse Now as among the very best films about conflict. For it wrestles with two of the great themes - memory and war - and dwells on the collision of the two. </p> <p>The form is startlingly original. The opening sequence - those hunting dogs - establishes a visual grammar, more graphic novel than kids' cartoon, that is sustained throughout. The figures do not move as they do in the Pixar movies that have raised a generation of children. Instead, they are still, \"cut-outs\" in which one limb might move while the rest remains static. The effect should be flat, but the low-tech style somehow conveys an emotional depth that catches you by surprise. The characters appear in two dimensions, yet are intensely human. </p> <p>Not least because their voices are real - not those of actors, but fellow veterans of the war interviewed by Folman. Indeed, it is Folman's voice we hear most often, and we see him in both his 19-year-old and 45-year-old incarnations. In the movie, he speaks to a half-dozen former comrades in arms, along with a therapist friend, a distinguished TV reporter who covered the 1982 war and an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. It is one of the former soldiers who gives the movie its title: a man, apparently crazed after a long shootout at a Beirut junction, who grabs a weapon from a fellow conscript and begins to fire wildly, as if dancing to some internal music - the entire scene played out before a giant street painting of the Lebanese president-elect, Bashir Gemayel. </p> <p>The climax of the movie, and the heart of Folman's missing memories, is the massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Enraged by Bashir's assassination, Christian Phalangist gunmen went on the rampage, murdering hundreds if not thousands of Palestinian men, women and children. (Estimates of the death toll range from 700 to more than 3,000.) Folman finally remembers that he was among the IDF men ordered to launch flares into the night sky over the camps. According to Israel's own Kahan commission of inquiry, the \"illumination\" was requested by the Phalangists to help them in their grisly work - though Folman is emphatic that at the time he and the soldiers beside him \"had no clue what was going on: we didn't know there was a massacre\". </p> <p>Those events prompted a bout of introspection in Israel that has rarely been equalled. An estimated crowd of 400,000 gathered in the centre of Tel Aviv to protest. Since that represented one tenth of the entire Israeli population, proportionally at least it can claim to be the largest political demonstration in any country at any time. Kahan found the then defence minister Ariel Sharon bore \"personal responsibility\" for the Palestinian deaths and concluded that he was unfit to serve in the defence ministry (though it did not stop him becoming prime minister 19 years later). </p> <p>All of this would have made compelling material in a conventional documentary, even a drama-documentary involving actors' reconstructions, but Folman never doubted that this film would have to be animated: \"There was no other way to do it, to show memories, hallucinations, dreams. War is like a really bad acid trip, and this was the only way to show that.\"</p> <p>Once you see the film, you know what he means: Carmi Cnaa'n recalls the boat ride that took him to Lebanon, how he threw up, how he then fell into sleep - \"I sleep when I'm scared\" - only to dream he was rescued by a voluptuous giantess, who held him like a nursing mother as she swam away from the vessel just seconds before it was bombed from the air. In a live-action movie, such a scene would have been impossible - or absurd. </p> <p>Driving the story is Folman's own quest to recover his memory, guided by his best friend-cum-therapist. Was the making of the film an act of therapy in itself? \"It was like scratching an old scar, an old wound,\" the director says, sitting in New York for yet another film festival, receiving another round of plaudits. \"The memories spurted out.\" </p> <p>And not only for him. Perhaps the most striking sequence in the film tells the story of Roni Dayg, today a lab chemist for an Israeli dairy company. Back in 1982 he was a tank loader when his unit came under fire. He and his comrades fled the tank, carrying no weapons, and were picked off, one by one, by Palestinian snipers concealed in the surrounding buildings. By the time Roni reached a rock and hid behind it, the rest of the men were dead. He waited, gasping for breath. The minutes passed until the snipers emerged, some of them just yards away from Roni. Somehow they never noticed him. </p> <p>He waited for nightfall, then ran towards the beach. With no clear plan, he plunged into the water and swam. And swam. And swam. An explosion struck nearby, rippling out across the water. But Roni kept swimming. Eventually, exhausted, he reached shore again. Who knew by then where he was? (In fact, despite swimming for six hours, he had covered only six kilometres.) He heard voices: they could have been Israelis, they could have been Lebanese. But the language was Hebrew. Incredibly, he had reached his very own regiment, finding them in the place to which they had retreated. He staggered on to the beach and was saved. </p> <p>When I speak to Roni Dayg, he concedes the strangeness of seeing the most traumatic moment of his life drawn and animated on a big screen. But he is relieved, too. For years, he explains, he had felt awkward with the loved ones of those soldiers killed beside the beach, as if they somehow resented Dayg for having survived, as if they believed he had saved himself at his comrades' expense. </p> <p>\"I couldn't look at their families,\" he says. \"I felt responsible. Now, with this film, it's all out. This shows what happened.\" He's had calls from old friends, people he hadn't seen for years. \"And that feels good.\"</p> <p>The relief is not confined to those featured in the movie. Waltz With Bashir seems to have released something long pent up among veterans of Israel's least celebrated war - described at the time as the country's first \"war of choice\". The film's makers say they are now constantly buttonholed by men in their 40s desperate to tell their stories of Lebanon. According to art director David Polonsky, \"You realise that they've been walking around for 25 years with this life-changing experience and they've never talked about it.\"</p> <p>This focus on the experiences of IDF veterans may bring grumbles from some of Israel's critics. Isn't Waltz With Bashir asking us, however artfully, to sympathise with the invaders of 1982, not the invaded - to somehow see the IDF, rather than the Lebanese and Palestinians of Beirut, as the victims of that war?</p> <p>It is not a new criticism. The spate of American antiwar movies about Vietnam were also faulted for casting young US draftees as the central casualties of the conflict, rather than the Vietnamese themselves. But there is a peculiarly Israeli dimension to the objection, too. In Hebrew they speak of \"shooting and crying\", shorthand for the tendency to depict the Israeli soldier as morally conflicted, the reluctant warrior whose heart is broken by having to kill his enemy. Such an archetype runs through Israeli folklore and can be seen as a mechanism that allows Israelis to emerge from even their darkest episodes with their moral self-image intact. </p> <p>Folman was fully alive to this risk, but is adamant that Waltz With Bashir does not succumb to it. \"When you watch this film, you have no doubt who the victims are.\" He says it's impossible to have sympathy for the IDF soldiers when you see the impact of their invasion - and this film certainly shows that impact, from the casual trashing of Beirut streets to the eventual carnage of the refugee camps. </p> <p>Indeed, the catastrophe at Sabra and Shatila is given a weight that sets it apart from the rest of the film. In the final minutes, animation gives way to real-life video footage of the slaughtered - including one unbearable image of a child. In this sense, the Palestinian dead are given a three-dimensional realness denied everyone else. </p> <p>Should Folman have gone further and told Palestinian stories with the same close humanity he gave to himself and his fellow Israelis? He considered it, wondered about making a \"Rashomon\" of 1982, showing the conflict from the differing viewpoints of all those involved. But it was not for him. \"Who am I to tell their stories?\" he says of the Palestinians. \"They have to tell their own stories.\" Not that Folman believes Waltz With Bashir conveys only a narrow Israeli experience. There is a universal lesson to be drawn from his film. It is that war is not Platoon or Steven Spielberg's Band Of Brothers: \"It has no glory, no glamour, no bravery, no brotherhood of men, nothing.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising frame of the entire movie is one of the very last: a fleeting acknowledgment of support from Israel's culture ministry and film board. Folman says that when Waltz With Bashir has played at festivals in cities around the world, local Israeli embassies have embraced it. </p> <p>It's an unexpected reaction, given the unflinching depiction of Israeli brutality, IDF soldiers shooting and shooting even when they have no idea who they are shooting at. And yet it's not so hard to understand. For one thing, the Israeli soldiers in the film have had their humanity restored to them: they are not faceless killing machines but terrified young boys. </p> <p>More importantly, perhaps, the film is at great pains to make crystal clear what has long been murky: exactly who did what at Sabra and Shatila. Again and again, Folman's script stresses that the massacre was committed by Christian Phalangists (who even slashed crosses into the chests of their victims). The publicity material quotes Folman thus: \"One thing for sure is that the Christian Phalangist militiamen were fully responsible for the massacre. The Israeli soldiers had nothing to do with it.\" That act of clarification is probably reason enough for Israeli officialdom to have welcomed the film. </p> <p>But there is much to give them discomfort. Sharon himself is shown tucking into a massive cooked breakfast - including five fried eggs - while the killing goes on all around. Later he is notified by phone that a massacre is rumoured to be underway: he thanks his informant and does nothing. That is one of the few flashes of political anger in the film. Elsewhere, there are no statements or polemics, even though its story was given new resonance as production got underway in the summer of 2006 - with the outbreak of the second Lebanon war. Polonksy, the art director, recalls that any illusion that he and his team of animators were working on a mere \"artwork\" was shattered. \"It was happening in real time again; the same stupidity all over again.\"</p> <p>Could Waltz With Bashir move Israeli hearts and minds so intensely that it prevents a future war? None involved thinks so. \"Cinema doesn't change the world,\" they say. But for those who where there, they have performed a service. \"None of us spoke about this war,\" says Folman. \"I've tried to open things up.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Waltz With Bashir is in cinemas from November 21.</p>",
  "<p>First I check out the mirror to make sure the light is flattering and will not throw back too clear an image. Antique mercury-based mirrors are kindest. Then I clear out all memories of what I looked like when I was 17, so as not to waste time shaking my fist at the heavens. I looked so much smoother then. Mind you, I was a fairly puffy, stolid-looking 17, and may not be so bad now. </p> <p>My mother believed vanity to be a sin, and self-adornment silly, and if women never achieved parity with men, it was because they spent so much of their lives fiddling with their hair and putting on lipstick. I look and feel more and more like my mother as time goes by. She thought that mirrors should be used as a tool for the brushing of teeth, not an instrument of self-esteem. </p> <p>But, anyway, I don't associate what I see in the mirror with me: surely there must be some error in transmission? Supposing one day I looked in the mirror and someone like Harrison Ford looked back at me, I would not be surprised. If you dabble in fiction, everything veers in and out of fiction. </p> <p>I look, I hesitate; then I take an eyeliner pencil and draw a line along the lashes of the upper lid, and my face begins to take one of its many forms. I marvel at people who go in search of the \"real me\" among the cluster of approximate \"me\"s they are used to. The true fear is that one will look in the mirror and there will be nothing there. It happened to my mother one day, when she became nothing but a death certificate. I can feel her just behind me, looking over my shoulder as I draw the line. I wonder if she can see herself?</p>",
  "<p>To the jury in Greece, John Hogan was insane. They concluded that the self-employed tiler from south Bristol was not guilty of murder, having been overcome by an \"earthquake\" of psychosis when he leapt from a hotel balcony, four floors up, with his two children. Six-year-old Liam Hogan died from his injuries; Mia, his two-year-old sister, survived. </p> <p>John Hogan maintained throughout the trial last January that he felt \"no guilt\" about Liam's death because the real Hogan had not done it, a cuckoo-like madness having displaced his good nature. He frustrated cross-examination by claiming to remember nothing about what he referred to as \"the accident\".</p> <p>For Hogan's wife, Natasha, who remarried a month before the trial, the verdict was a travesty. Liam had \"died for nothing\" and Hogan had \"given the best performance of his life\". The Greek authorities had conspired to expedite the hearing, concentrating on Hogan's state of mind, while failing to call essential British eyewitnesses whose statements contradicted Hogan's claim to have jumped with his children in his arms on the night of August 15 2006 and suggested something far more calculating.</p> <p>The dispute would transform the so-called \"balcony leap case\" - a story of how a British family on holiday bloodily self-destructed in public - into one of the most talked about in living memory: was Hogan a father driven mad or a murderer feigning insanity to escape conviction?</p> <p>On March 27 2008, at Liam Hogan's belated inquest in Bristol, the coroner intervened, setting aside consideration of Hogan's state of mind and calling the overlooked British eyewitnesses. Their original unpublished statements, taken by Avon and Somerset police eight days after Liam's death, placed Sarah Davidson, from Hull, outside the Petra Mare hotel in Crete at 11pm, just moments before the tragedy occurred. She told the police that, startled by the sound of a \"horrific argument\" coming from a top-floor bedroom, she had looked up to see two blond-haired children standing on a balcony wall. They were silent and motionless. She said: \"I struggled to comprehend why [they] would stand in such a dangerous position.\" Where were their parents? Then she saw a man appear behind the children and lunge forward \"with an open-armed movement\". </p> <p>Davidson's friend, Kerry Jackman, who was standing beside her, cried out: \"Oh my God, he's pushed his kids off.\" Jackman told police, \"I got the impression that the boy was trying to grab the little girl's hand.\" Davidson was mesmerised by the sight of children falling \"like stars\". The man jumped seconds later. There were three loud thuds. \"It then went very quiet,\" Jackman said. </p> <p>These chilling testimonies, which portrayed Hogan as having pushed his children over, rather than having leapt with them in \"a moment of madness\", led Paul Forrest, the Avon and Somerset coroner, to reach a verdict of \"unlawful killing\", opening up the real possibility that Hogan would be charged again with murder if he returned to the UK. Although the Crown Prosecution Service announced in late September that it did not intend to press charges unless compelling new evidence was found, the possibility of a private prosecution remains.</p> <p>John Hogan, who had been due to be released from psychiatric care shortly after his trial, has stayed in Greece while his family's legal team struggles to make him immune to prosecution in this country. On November 4, the high court in London will hear an application by the Hogan family for a judicial review of the coroner's verdict, calling for it to be quashed, enabling Hogan to come home a free man. He has not seen Mia since the night of Liam's death, and has spoken of his desire to be reunited. Her mother, Natasha, who suspected he was trying to speak to his daughter on his Greek mobile phone, has pledged that Mia will not see her father until she is 18 and specifically asks to meet him; the family moved to Australia last summer.</p> <p>But the debate continues about who John Hogan really is and what he has done. He's an \"emotional imbecile\" Germaine Greer said in this newspaper; a \"killer dad\", the Sun claimed. It is difficult to glimpse the real man amid the speculation and name-calling.</p> <p>The Hogans, an Irish Catholic family, have remained tight-lipped throughout. Back in the south Bristol suburb of Bedminster, where John Hogan grew up, it has been the same, the community closing around him like a zip-lock bag. </p> <p>However, now that Hogan's return to the UK is imminent, some have begun to open up, those closest to him pointing to a particular location in Bristol that underpins his personal story. This is a well-tended family plot on a sweeping grass slope in South Bristol Cemetery, overlooking Clifton suspension bridge, which they say shows why Hogan's state of mind is every bit as important as the bare facts. </p> <p>Here, six-year-old Liam was interred beneath a black granite headstone engraved with a Dalek and Thomas the Tank Engine. When we visited, it was still scattered with cards from schoolfriends left on what would have been his eighth birthday (May 30 2008), as well as gifts: a plastic Cyberman and Dr Who's Tardis. </p> <p>Just two rows behind lies a similar granite headstone, this one with flowers placed by Josephine Hogan, John's mother. This marks the grave of John Joseph Hogan, John's father, who died from a chronic illness at 55. It is shared by Stephen Hogan, John's youngest brother, who died at 17 in what a coroner ruled was an \"accidental death\". And, just visible above the grass verge, on the thin side of the headstone, is an inscription for Paul Hogan, John's elder brother, who killed himself at 35.</p> <p>In between the flowers is an inscription family friends say explains some of what the Hogans have kept to themselves up until now, a suggestion that there was a real and invasive madness at the root of John Hogan's crime. \"When a family chain is broken things are not the same,\" the epitaph reads, hinting at the tragic episodes that tipped Hogan over the edge. \"But as God calls us one by one we will link that chain again.\" Abject loss, the pain of separation and the pull of death were notions in which John Hogan was steeped for decades before the plunge from a Cretan balcony.</p> <p>Family photos, videos and letters show how young Liam emulated his father. He gelled his hair like him, kicked a ball around with him; footage shows him dancing like his dad to Elton John's Are You Ready For Love, the year before Hogan killed him. It was often John Hogan who read Liam bedtime stories and comforted him when he was hurt. The one thing John and his former wife Natasha still agree on is that Liam was \"a real daddy's boy\".</p> <p>John Hogan's childhood was spent in south Bristol, as leader of a close-knit gang of BS3 boys, the postcode for their turf in Bedminster. He bragged that he was the best-looking among them: Jeff, Bloomer, Wozzle, Popey and Martin. They all agreed he was the most promising footballer. Mike \"Bloomer\" Broad - named after a cheery underdog who once played for Bristol Rovers - was too overweight to match him, while his sister had an eye for Hogan and would send him Bristol City match programmes every week after his arrest on Crete. Martin Williams, the karaoke star of the group, whose back garden overlooked the Hogans', was the organised one (and after Hogan's trial would arrange regular trips to Greece to visit his best mate). Williams, Hogan and John \"Popey\" Pope all came from large Irish Catholic families, went to school at Holy Cross primary and in 1981 took their first holy communion together at the church next door. Chris Wilsford was Wozzle, boss-eyed and big-eared, who went with the crowd (and was among those who flew over to visit Hogan after he was transferred from prison to an Athens psychiatric hospital in January). And Jeff Hall was the timid one, who still has not a bad word to say about one of his oldest friends.</p> <p>With Bristol City's Ashton Gate stadium a stroll from their homes, it was football that brought them together - though none of them could afford tickets. As teenagers, it was Hogan who came up with plans to find money, such as stealing soft drink bottles, left for the Corona man in crates on people's doorsteps, empties that the gang cashed in for Natch cider at the off-licence in North Street. </p> <p>Broad, now a builder, and an ardent defender of Hogan, says, \"We were just kids, but they didn't care.\" The centre of their world was South Street playing field, with its peeling all-weather pitch, and the old YMCA nearby. Bedminster was as tight as a half-hitch. The terraced homes here toppled into one other like playing cards and all news fed back to \"Ma\", John's mother, Josephine. Coming from a sheltered upbringing in County Kildare, she never missed mass at the Holy Cross, in Dean Lane, a 10-minute walk up and downhill from the family's home at 215 Luckwell Road. Josephine turned to the church for all her emotional needs, a faith she brought with her when, in the 50s, she moved to Bedminster, where she met her Irish husband, John Sr; they moved into their home when she was pregnant with Christine, their first child, in the early 60s. </p> <p>Today, the curtains are drawn, the front window broken, weeds strangling a once immaculate front garden - the Hogans moved out earlier this year, when Josephine was forced to sell up to pay for her son's defence in Greece. But once this house, with its pebble-dashed walls, postage stamp front room, three bedrooms and a tiny strip of a garden - planted with apple trees by John's dead brother Paul - was a nucleus for the family. Almost all the watershed moments in John Hogan's life happened here, some of them tumultuous episodes that, he would later tell Greek psychiatrist Markos Skondras, culminated in a leap from a hotel balcony.</p> <p>The Hogans went on to have a second daughter (Gabriella, born in 1966) and four boys: William (1965), Paul (1968), John (1974) and Stephen (1979). Most were home births. For John, six years younger than Paul and almost a decade younger than William, life would revolve around Stephen, his baby brother. The two of them, the youngest, could get away with anything. But in this intense and overcrowded house, John Hogan would later reflect to the psychiatrist in Greece, he never heard his parents say they loved him. On its own, this might sound like a petty complaint from an immature, self-centred boy, but it would become a factor in a cascade of events that ultimately drove him over the edge, Skondras concluded in 2007.</p> <p>Hogan's relationship with his father was distant. John Sr's world revolved exclusively around the Irish community in Bedminster, the Holy Cross social club and Zanetti &amp; Bailey, a local building firm that employed him as a tiler. Josephine made more of an effort to integrate, and was friendly with their next-door neighbours, Josie and Brian Woodward, who were West Country people. The Woodwards still live at 213 Luckwell Road. \"Our families grew up together,\" Josie says. \"John loved those kids. Every weekend we watched over the fence as he and Liam kicked a ball around. He tried hard not to be like his father.\"</p> <p>By the time John Hogan was 16, his father had developed multiple sclerosis. Unemployable, bored and belligerent, he took to drinking heavily at the social club. Friend and neighbour Dickie Sanders, from number 217, recalls: \"He would come home so drunk he could barely make it up the path to his front door.\" Billy from Tyrone, a drinking pal at the club, describes him as \"an awkward bugger\" who began to fall out with his friends.</p> <p>When he was at home, he became a brooding presence, asleep before the gas fire or hung over. John, who shared a room with Stephen, was now battling for space. Their elder brother, Paul, known as an oddball, was a constant source of tension. He had got into university - a first for the Hogan family - and excelled at cross-country running, his silver trophies lining the front room. But Paul proved to be bipolar and later moved in and out of sheltered accommodation. To get away from the morbidity of it all, John stayed out.</p> <p>Every Friday, the Hogan gang met at the South Street playing field at 7.30pm. They kicked a ball around, glugged cider and smoked. Patrick Hart, a youth worker at the nearby YMCA, suggested they start a Sunday league team, thus beginning a long relationship with the boys that would culminate in him writing a character reference for John Hogan's Greek defence team last January.</p> <p>Bloomer was on board from the off. He says: \"We got \u00a3800 from the Prince's Trust and Soundsville, a local record shop, sponsored our black and blue kits. We had all just passed our driving tests and were getting up a team.\" Soundsville FC had no home pitch and played at the Netham Rec, a few miles to the north. Gang joker Jeff Hall recalls: \"We were pretty crap to start with. Lost every match. But Hogan became a great striker, scoring loads of goals.\" Although the team would fold at the end of the 90s, after most of the players got married, they re-formed when John Hogan was arrested, playing a charity game to raise money to help his mother stay out in Greece.</p> <p>When Hogan's gang looked old enough to get served alcohol, a ritual was born: Saturday night on the lash in Bedminster's North Street pubs, such as the Masonic, the Spotted Cow, the Full Moon; Sunday morning in the rain at Netham Rec. Bloomer says: \"Half of us were spewing on the sideline, especially Hogan who, like his dad, could easily down nine pints.\" At the end of every match it was down to the Coronation Tap, in Dean Lane, beside their old primary school. \"We all arrived commando - no pants,\" Bloomer says, grinning. The changing rooms at the rec were so dire, no one bothered to shower.</p> <p>Landlords Dave and Rose would put on food. \"We'd take over the big bay window and before our dinner we'd all have pickled eggs and a pint of Blackthorn down in one. We'd vote for who had been man of the match, fanny of the match and fanny of the week. God help any girls who came in as we'd rip off their G-strings,\" Bloomer says.</p> <p>Through the 90s, Soundsville FC went on tour. Butlins in Minehead. Then Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Turkey. There was no football involved, though the team printed up T-shirts with a picture of Williams above the caption \"Martin's Black and Blue Army\". Bloomer says: \"Hogan was a nightmare. We'd win \u00a35 for every pair of girls' knickers we could produce and one morning I remember seeing him with three pairs on each arm.\" </p> <p>Back home, Williams, Popey and Hogan had all left St Bernadette's RC secondary school at 16. They contemplated the army, but became tradesmen instead, Hogan following his dad to Zanetti &amp; Bailey. Soundsville FC continued to rule their lives. By 1995, the team was going up the Bristol suburban league and had developed a fan base, among them an outspoken blonde, Natasha Steel. She was two years older than Hogan and an outsider, having grown up in Louisiana, in the US, before moving to Bristol in her teens; she went to St Mary Redcliffe &amp; Temple, a high-achieving CofE school in Bristol city centre.</p> <p>Natasha recalls: \"Hogan was 22 and still living at home.\" She was training to be a nurse at Bristol Royal Infirmary, and the combination of her outsider status and quasi-medical expertise drew Hogan to confide in her that he feared being engulfed by family troubles. His father's MS had become critical and, after one of his legs was amputated, his bed was moved into the front room at Luckwell Road. He was now entirely dependent on Josephine. Paul's eccentricities, meanwhile, had developed into serious mental health problems, resulting in his being sectioned, and Stephen was becoming uncontrollable. Brian Woodward recalls: \"Stephen was a tearaway. He was always coming round here asking for aspirins. Any kind of pill. He wanted to try them all.\"</p> <p>John Hogan and Natasha were complicated, too. She was supposedly going out with another Irish Bedminster boy, Gerry O'Keefe, a part-time Soundsville FC player. A distraught O'Keefe ended up going back to Ireland on his own, before Christmas 1995, while Natasha and Hogan got it together, somewhere between the Imp and the Masonic, on the Soundsville FC Christmas Eve pub crawl.</p> <p>There was little time to enjoy it. By February 1996, 215 Luckwell Road was awash with medication and surgical equipment, ruled by \"despair and grief\", Natasha recalls. On February 13, John's father died.</p> <p>Roles were radically redefined. Josephine spent her days at the South Bristol Cemetery, placing red and yellow carnations on her husband's grave on which she had inscribed \"Goodnight Godbless Sweet Heart\". Paul was back at 215 Luckwell Road but incapable of looking after himself, his symptoms - a rising feeling of panic and depression - not that dissimilar from those that would later consume his brother, John. Stephen, careening around Bedminster, out of work, was left to his own devices. The older Hogan siblings had already moved out, leaving John the responsible one. In a psychological assessment made on December 3 2006, Professor Ioannis Nestoros noted that his patient had found his new role as Stephen and Paul's protector extremely stressful - he was \"incapable of handling intense emotional pressure\". </p> <p>That April, John and Natasha became engaged; she had \"a romantic idea\" and moved into Luckwell Road. The house was gloomy and crowded, and Hogan was out of sorts. He had been to see the family doctor and was now on a course of anti-depressants, while Stephen, who had already lost his father and saw little of his mother, became resentful at losing John to an outsider like Natasha.</p> <p>By the summer, Natasha believed that life at 215 had stabilised. On Sunday June 30, Josephine was in Ireland with relatives and friends. Bloomer and Hogan were playing for Soundsville FC. Afterwards, they headed for the Coronation Tap and the Spotted Cow. It was turning into a session. Bloomer recalls: \"John said, 'Let's drop my car home.' As we pulled up outside Luckwell Road, he mentioned that he was worried, not having seen Stephen all weekend.\" Natasha drove up. \"Tash said she would check for Stephen upstairs,\" Bloomer recalls. \"She called me up. There he was, lying in bed, the covers pulled up to his chin, a bottle of pills and cider on the bedside table. We didn't know what to tell John. Tash called an ambulance but he was obviously dead. I left to find Paul and tell the boys in the pub.\" </p> <p>Natasha remembers: \"Two days earlier, John had had an argument and told Stephen, 'Sort your fucking life out.' \" Now, on John's watch, Stephen had swallowed his dad's leftover painkillers.</p> <p>John's dad was dead. His brother, too. An inquest generously ruled Stephen's death as \"accidental\", getting Josephine out of a tight spot with the Holy Cross who could not countenance burying a suicide case. To John Joseph Hogan's black granite headstone in South Bristol Cemetery, his youngest son's name was added: \"Goodnight Godbless Steve.\" And it was then that the new inscription was added, too, about the family chain being broken. It would be read and reread by a guilt-ridden John Hogan, who would later tell Professor Nestoros in Greece that he felt responsible, having instigated a new \"tough love\" relationship with tearaway Stephen. </p> <p>The Hogans, and John in particular, began to turn inwards. Natasha says: \"Within a week I was asked to leave Luckwell Road.\" The couple split up, with Hogan later telling his psychiatrist that he never got over his brother's death.</p> <p>However, two years later, in October 1998, when he bumped into Natasha at the Mandrake nightclub in Bristol city centre, she thought he had recovered and they got back together. Natasha insisted John leave home and \"his mother's apron strings\". She took him out of Bedminster, buying a house in Bradley Stoke, a new town on the other side of Bristol, known by its inhabitants as \"Sadly Broke\" after a recent housing crash there. It was miles away from Hogan's emotional crutches: Soundsville FC, the Coronation Tap and Luckwell Road.</p> <p>Within six months, Natasha was pregnant and John Hogan began to reel again. \"He would run back to Bedminster. Getting drunk all the time,\" she remembers. There were other, more worrying developments. Hogan became incapable of eating in public. He developed agoraphobia, collapsing in Asda, suffering from panic attacks so frequent and violent that he was prescribed beta-blockers and counselling - sessions from which Natasha was precluded and about which Hogan never spoke. If he had, the similarities with his elder brother Paul's condition would have been obvious.</p> <p>But when Liam Stephen Hogan was born, in May 2000, in Southmead hospital - his middle name given in memory of a wayward uncle who never grew up - John appeared to get back on track. Natasha later told British police: \"He realised he could make a good first-time dad.\"</p> <p>Within two years, Hogan and Natasha were married. The Soundsville years began to fade and when, on April 27 2004, Mia Hogan was born, her father didn't shoot out to the pub. He was \"attentive and totally different\", and even started wearing his wedding ring. \"Our relationship was fine,\" Natasha says, until one month later, when she took a midnight call from Christine, John's eldest sister: 215 Luckwell Road was burning. </p> <p>Neighbour Brian Woodward had alerted the family. \"Josephine was back in Ireland and her house was empty,\" Woodward says. \"But I had seen Paul earlier in the evening skulking around the back garden with bits of wood.\" </p> <p>Dickie Sanders, at 217, woke up around midnight: \"My bedroom wall was roasting hot,\" he says. He ran out to see the Hogans' house on fire.</p> <p>After the fire was extinguished, the police began looking for Paul. Natasha says: \"John called me at 10am the next morning to say someone had jumped from Clifton suspension bridge.\" The corpse was so badly mangled that the police asked the family to view CCTV footage. It was Paul. Dead at 35. Natasha believed John handled Paul's suicide admirably. But Bloomer knew Hogan kept a copy of the death plunge video at home, to watch over and over again. Hogan had been to see Paul's psychiatrist a week before Paul killed himself, to complain that his brother was leaning too heavily on their mother. He now believed he had tipped Paul over the edge - fears he would keep bottled up until, three years later, he confessed to a counsellor in Greece that his brother's death had profoundly affected him, making him feel once again that he was the one left behind. </p> <p>This time there was no conclusion a coroner could reach other than suicide. Paul's name was added to the family headstone. Just the barest details. Josephine had run out of words. She bought another bouquet of red and yellow carnations.</p> <p>Natasha needed to clear her head. She accepted a nursing job in Newport, south Wales, which took her away for days at a time. John brought his mother over to Bradley Stoke to look after Liam and Mia, while he went into the tiling business with a work colleague, Mike \"Spike\" Foster. The stress of being self-employed mingled with a growing concern that he was losing control of Natasha. Fits of jealousy saw him browse through her private computer files, where he found innocent but flirtatious email exchanges with an old school friend. John called Natasha at work, crying. He rang the old friend, too, threatening to tell the man's wife. A year later, Hogan's psychiatrist would note: \"The violent deaths of his brothers have led him to experience great emotional stress at the prospect of distancing and separating from loved ones. He has a great need to express his feelings and especially feelings of love, but an even greater need for others to express their feelings towards him.\"</p> <p>Loneliness terrified Hogan. But having won back some independence, Natasha was not going to roll over. \"Now it was my turn,\" she recalls. Their marriage rollercoastered until, one rainy day in February 2006, they decided to book a family holiday to see if they could work things through. \"We wanted it to be perfect,\" Natasha says.</p> <p>One week before they set off for Crete, in August 2006, Hogan delved into Natasha's computer files again, discovering she had been browsing divorce websites. When she came home, she insisted it had been a \"flippant\" search. But, confronted by Hogan's hysteria, she made a decision. \"I told him that I thought the relationship was not working,\" she says, adding that they had agreed to go on holiday to talk about it. Bloomer bumped into Hogan in the Imp later that night: \"I said, 'What you doing here?' He said, 'We've had another row. Can I stay?' But in the end he went off to his ma's and the next time I saw him was on TV after he'd killed Liam.\"</p> <p>It is difficult to sympathise with a child killer, especially when he or she is the parent. But while no one can excuse it, the background to a seemingly incomprehensible act can be revealing. In the case of John Hogan, the signs were there for years, some inherited and some learned.</p> <p>Some aspects of depression, psychiatrists claim, can be passed down the generations. Suicide is often described as a \"learned act\", an idea planted by one family member that germinates and perpetuates in another, eventually set off by a precipitous series of incidents. </p> <p>John Hogan's underlying fear of loneliness would heighten in the days before he set off for Crete as it dawned on him that he might lose his children and wife, too. </p> <p>The journey to Crete began badly: a terror alert at the airport meant long delays and the family, tense and exhausted, didn't arrive at the Petra Mare hotel until 10am the following day, August 11 2006. Although they had booked a ground-floor, pool-side apartment, they were shown to room 446, on the top floor, over the hotel entrance and facing a busy main road. Spotting the balcony, Natasha was immediately worried about their children's safety. </p> <p>By day two, Hogan seemed to have calmed down and was \"spending lots of money on the children\", trying to show them how much he loved them. When he pressed his case with Natasha on the third day, and tried to kiss her, she pulled away. That evening he reverted to his old Soundsville behaviour, downing pints before entering an 80s dance competition in the hotel bar, a performance that rapidly degenerated into a long, silent walk off stage. \"John was embarrassed and worrying,\" Natasha says.</p> <p>He spent the fourth day on his own, turning inwards, as his family had always done, returning only at 4pm, to challenge Natasha as to whether she had made a decision about leaving him. \"Maybe,\" she replied weakly. He shouted \"Fine,\" before going off fishing with Liam. He seemed unhinged. Natasha called her mother, Liz Steel, back in Bristol for advice. Steel says: \"While I was on the phone to Tash throughout that day, John kept disappearing with Liam, he kept trailing him around the hotel and grounds with Liam sobbing his heart out.\" </p> <p>When they returned at 6.30pm, Hogan began arguing. \"He had completely lost the plot,\" Natasha recalls. He shouted, \"If you think you're living in that house with the kids ... you're not, I'll burn it to the ground.\" Hogan would later tell his psychiatrist the deaths of his brothers were in his head at that moment, particularly that of Paul, who had left Luckwell Road smouldering.</p> <p>Two hours later, the row continued in the hotel bar. Liz Steel, again on the phone to her daughter, recalls: \"Tash at that point was frozen to her seat - John kept coming in and out, shouting in front of everyone in the hotel bar. People were looking. He was getting nastier. She was trying to keep calm for Mia.\" Oblivious to everyone, Hogan began shouting: \"We're going home. I've packed the cases, you can stay.\" Natasha went up to their room with Mia to call her mother again. Liz Steel says: \"I told Tash I was not happy about what John was doing - she needed to go find John and Liam. I said, 'I am now terribly worried about the safety of my grandchildren, Tash - you must do something now!' \"</p> <p>While Natasha was still on the phone, Liam appeared at their bedroom door. He had been due to go to a children's movie night and had even bought his sweets ready, but now, Natasha recalls, \"He ran in, sobbing, saying, 'You're splitting up.' \" Liam was by now in no fit state to go to see a film, so they all went back down to the lobby to find Hogan demanding that holiday reps book flights for him and the children to go back immediately to Bristol. \"By now he was really mad and shouting loudly,\" Natasha says. Hogan would later tell his psychiatrist, \"I couldn't bear the thought that I would be left alone, that I would come in from work and not see my kids.\"</p> <p>Natasha rang her mother again. Liz Steel says: \"I told her not to let Liam and Mia out of her sight.\" After staff made it clear that there were no flights available, Natasha and the children returned to the room. \"It looked as if clothes had just been thrown into the suitcases,\" says Natasha, who began putting them in order. Hogan came in at 10.15pm, to see the story of his life unfolding from those bags. \"My packing is shit,\" he began screaming. Bags, kids, father, mother, brothers, sisters, girlfriends - all, he would tell his psychiatrist later, had been inconsistent, too demanding, challenging or disappointing. Now he began hurtling around the room, throwing the children's clothes about him.</p> <p>Liam began screaming, disturbed by his father's mania. Natasha, Hogan claimed, delivered a cruel jab, lambasting his family as a \"family of death\". This would, he said, be the last thing he could remember, words that were an invitation for a man mortally afraid of abandonment, an agoraphobic who could see only the wide-open spaces of a life estranged.</p> <p>For Hogan, the chain was broken. Natasha would tell police: \"I turned my back for what seemed like a split second. I looked around; there was sudden silence. The room was empty apart from me.\"</p> <p>\"I remember my mother in the hospital ... She told me what had happened.\" Hogan's jumbled thoughts were recorded by psychiatrist Markos Skondras in July 2007. \"My little boy is dead ... My God ... My family meant everything to me ... I didn't mean to harm him. I loved him so much. What have I done? I can't stop thinking about it. It's driving me mad. I'm in prison. I've never hurt anyone. Thank God I don't remember.\" Hogan was by then on six different kinds of medication, and already trying to kill himself, inventively, furtively, determinedly.</p> <p>His condition would improve. He was transferred to a psychiatric hospital where he could wander freely, receive visitors and make calls to Bedminster. Friends and relatives reported back to him the discussions they had with us. Then in September, a curious texting relationship began, with Hogan sending us messages, including one to contact Professor Nestoros - he wanted his psychiatrist to do the talking. He was fearful of the November hearing - his family's attempt to get quashed the British coroner's verdict of unlawful killing - worried that it would fail, leaving him open to further prosecution.</p> <p>We rang Nestoros. He appeared to answer the call but, instead of talking to us, put the handset down, so that we could hear his voice. He was reassuring someone in the room with him. \"You're on the road to recovery, John,\" he said. Then came a voice with a West Country accent: \"But I can still hear Liam screaming. I can't get it out of my head.\"</p> <p>Whether it was an accident or a demonstration of remorse - part of the campaign to place Hogan's delusions and suffering as central to his case - his anguish was palpable. Unable to question, only to listen, we cut the line.</p>",
  "<p>For members of the public he was merely a voice, hidden behind 10-foot screens to protect his anonymity, and known only as Charlie 12. At 1.46pm, two hours into his evidence, he suddenly became human.</p> <p>Much has been written about what happened inside tube carriage 53613, where Jean Charles de Menezes lost his life in a confluence of circumstances on which an inquest jury will have to pass judgment. Yet until now nothing has been heard from the man who pulled the trigger at point blank range, firing at least three times into the head of de Menezes, who he assumed was a suspected suicide bomber.</p> <p>In a conference room at Oval cricket ground yesterday, the firearms officer, who has served 25 years in the police, faced the dead man's mother and brother to explain his role in the tragedy. </p> <p>For five weeks the de Menezes family, the media, the lawyers and those members of the public who have attended the inquest every day have waited for the moment when Charlie 12 was brought to court to give evidence. </p> <p>Like 49 other police witnesses, his identity was protected by screens that block his face from everyone except a select group in the courtroom. But for those sitting in the public area of the court yesterday, the arrival of C12 into his seat was met with emotional anticipation reserved for him alone.</p> <p>He read the oath in a firm, strong voice, promising to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Two thirds of the way through his evidence, he faltered only slightly when he said he knew what the family were about to hear would be extremely distressing. </p> <p>\"I cannot begin to put myself in the position that they are in,\" he said. \"I am a family man myself and to lose a son or any member of your family in this situation, I just cannot believe. I offer them my sincere condolences.\"</p> <p>But it was only after the hearing that his feelings overwhelmed him, and he broke down.</p> <p>Over almost three hours of questioning from Nicholas Hilliard QC, counsel for the coroner, C12 described his actions on July 22 2005. A specialist firearms officer since 1998, he had never fired a gun at a suspect before. </p> <p>On the morning of July 22 he was in the team of firearms officers who were informed they would be involved in an anti-terrorist operation following the previous day's attempted bombings in London, and two weeks after the July 7 tube bombs.</p> <p>He collected his Glock pistol, two magazines containing 17 rounds each and specialist 124-grain ammunition, said to be the most suitable for immediate incapacitation.</p> <p>At 7.45am, he and others were given a 25-minute briefing which gave him details of Hussain Osman, one of the would-be suicide bombers who was on the run after failing to blow up his bomb at Shepherd's Bush tube the day before, and was told he \"may have to use ... unusual tactics that we had not used before\".</p> <p>After a second, more detailed briefing from the anti-terrorist branch at 8.45am, C12 said, \"I was left in no doubt as to the type of suspects we were preparing to intercept. That they were prepared to take their own and others' lives and the danger faced would be immeasurable.</p> <p>\"We were possibly about to face suspects who were trained and had attempted to commit atrocities on innocent human beings ... there was a real, tangible danger that if we didn't act quickly or correctly then there would be extreme loss of life.</p> <p>\"How would you feel? What would you do? These devices could be concealed around the body, hidden from view. How would you act faced with this type of threat?</p> <p>\"The whole journey was an extremely emotional one for me ... at the briefing and at the possibility of not going home again at the end of the day.\"</p> <p>Deployed with the other firearms teams, C12 arrived at Stockwell tube. Informed by surveillance teams the suspect had left the bus, there was a long period of radio silence and then the words: \"Towards platform one and two.\"</p> <p>Over the radio he heard: \"All units state red, state red\". </p> <p>\"I immediately left my vehicle and sprinted toward the entrance to the tube. My firearm was in my waistband ... and I carried a blue overshirt and a handheld radio it was an attempt to remain covert.\"</p> <p>As he ran into the station, he saw another firearms officer, C2, coming the other way. \"I distinctly remember seeing him, and we had eye contact ... it was certainly reassuring that another firearms officer was there.\"</p> <p>Running into the station, he jumped the barriers, pushing away a member of London Underground staff and pulling out his gun. </p> <p>\"I could hear people behind me shouting 'Armed police, get out of the way.'\" </p> <p>He ran down the escalator, passing a surveillance officer who said: \"He's on the north-bound tube.\"</p> <p>Heading towards the tube carriage he saw another man standing in open double doors who gesticulated towards his left. </p> <p>\"I had to try and pick out where this suspect was, I had to try and remember to be covert ... If I hadn't, if I had shown myself as a police officer ... we could be dealing with the detonation of a bomb,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I remember trying to take in as much information as I could and keep as close as I could to the side of the tube while looking in and trying to pick up any information I could from inside the carriage.\"</p> <p>C12 said despite believing the suspect was a suicide bomber, it was not inevitable that he would open fire. \"I did not have any preconceived ideas of what I was going to do.\"</p> <p>Another surveillance officer at the doors made a clear, overt gesture with his right hand and said, \"That's him,\" pointing towards the suspect. Pausing in his narrative, C12 told the jury he had to make it clear the speed at which the next events unfolded. </p> <p>He said he believed, mistakenly, the suspect was wearing a bulky denim jacket, and when he entered the train, de Menezes reacted. \"He immediately looked in our direction and stood up.</p> <p>\"It was a free-flowing movement from looking in our direction and standing up, he immediately came towards us and closed down the distance between us. His hands were waist height ... I couldn't understand the reaction.\" </p> <p>He believed De Menezes was aggressive and was moving towards him in order to maximise the impact of the blast from the bomb.</p> <p>\"I shouted 'armed police' [and] at the same time brought my gun up from my leg and pointed it at his head area.</p> <p>\"He continued to move towards me ... it was at that stage I thought: 'He is going to detonate, he is going to kill us and I have to act now in order to stop this from happening ... </p> <p>\"If I didn't act members of the public would be killed, my colleagues would be killed and I would be killed. I had a duty to protect the public.\"</p> <p>De Menezes was grabbed by another surveillance officer, Ivor, and pushed into his seat. \"I went with Ivor so when de Menezes reached the chair we were all together like in a rugby scrum. I had to get my gun past Ivor and I remember the gun actually coming into contact with him. I don't know how close the gun was, but it had to be close because I couldn't afford to miss.\"</p> <p>Asked if he intended to kill, he replied: \"Yes sir.\" Asked why he fired three times, he said: \"I had to be certain the life was extinct, that there wasn't any more threat, that this person couldn't detonate a bomb. I fired a number of shots because I could detect movement, albeit it might have been caused by the bullets ... I had to make sure that the threat no longer existed.\"</p> <p>Satisfied that the man was dead, he shouted: \"Bomb, everyone off\" to clear the carriage.</p> <p>In the next few moments he left the tube with the other firearms officer, C2. As he recalled how the men checked each other for injuries, he broke down and could not go on.</p> <p>\"Just take your time,\" Hilliard told him. </p> <p>\"Please don't think you are under any pressure,\" said the coroner, Sir Michael Wright. \"Would you like a break?\" </p> <p>The officer's response was inaudible beneath suppressed sobs and the hearing was adjourned for 10 minutes.</p> <p>When he returned, C12 finished what he had tried to say: \"We were covered in blood,\" he said. \"We just lifted up each others T-shirts just to make sure we weren't hurt.\"</p> <p>At midday the next day he discovered had killed the wrong man. \"How did you feel?\" said Hilliard.</p> <p>\"A sense of disbelief, and shock, sadness, confusion,\" said the officer. \"Everything I have ever trained for, threat assessment, seeing threats, perceiving threats and acting on threats proved wrong, and I am responsible for the death of an innocent man. That is something I have got to live with for the rest of my life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Will it be tax trick or treat for you this Hallowe'en? If you send in a self-assessment tax return on a paper form, then you'll have to deliver it to a tax office by October 31, not January 31 as in past years. That's next Friday, so it's time to get your tax skates on.</p> <p>It's all change this year - besides redesigning tax forms, the Revenue has decreed those filing paper returns have three months less to send forms in than those who file online - internet taxpayers still have until January 31.</p> <p>The Revenue carrot is that anyone getting the form in on time will not have to bother calculating how much tax they have to pay - or any refund - as the taxman will do the arithmetic and send a bill. The final payment date remains January 31 whether filing is online or on paper. The Revenue stick is that anyone missing the Hallowe'en deadline could be hit with a \u00a3100 fine.</p> <p>But it's not quite so black and white - even if you fail to file by October 31 and can't face doing it online, there is still hope. Despite all the Moira Stuart-led publicity, even the Revenue has realised it's the most vulnerable taxpayers, such as the elderly and those with disabilities, who tend to stick to paper returns. </p> <p>It has decided to extend the deadline to first thing on Tuesday November 4 for those who can deliver the form to their local tax office - it does not have to be the office where their affairs are dealt with, although it's best to find one with a letter box. That could give you another weekend.</p> <p>\"More crucially, you can also avoid a fine by calculating your tax and paying that before January 31 even if your paper return is late,\" says David Searle, tax partner at accountants Baker Tilly. </p> <p>\"Provided you hand over the tax due by the final payment date in full, you cannot be fined as penalties are capped at the lesser of \u00a3100 or the tax outstanding. If there is no tax unpaid the \u00a3100 penalty would not be applicable,\" he says. </p> <p>Andy Hardy at TaxCalc, which sells computer software for tax returns, says last year one million had to pay a penalty for late filing - about one in eight. </p> <p>\"You can cap the penalty to zero if you pay in full in advance - if you can't work it out, our software will do the sums for you at around a quarter of the cost of a \u00a3100 fine. But this \"capping\" only applies to individuals and sole traders - not those in partnerships,\" he says. \"If you are missing one or two figures from your paperwork, then you could make a good guess on the figures but point out that it's a 'provisional figure.' You have to send in the correct numbers as soon as you can, but, provided you pay enough or overpay, fines cannot be imposed.\"</p> <p>The Revenue accepts that there may be some cases where people will not be able to take advantage of electronic filing. \"They could include those with very specific affairs including MPs and their Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland equivalents, some ministers of religion and those with some unusual foreign incomes,\" says David Kilshaw at accountants KPMG.</p> <p>\"There's also a 'reasonable excuse' form but that's really for accountants,\" he adds. \"Some taxpayers have already been told they cannot file online and will be exempt from the new date.\"</p> <p>The Revenue says the best option is to switch to online filing where possible. To do this, go to the <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa\">www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa</a> website and click on Register for Self-Assessment Online.\" </p> <p>You will need your unique taxpayer reference (10 digits long), national insurance number and postcode. </p> <p>\"If you have not yet registered for online,\" says Hardy at TaxCalc, \"the Revenue will write to you shortly after October 31 to 'pre-register' you for internet filing. It's intended as a wake-up - many could use electronic forms easily enough. It works a lot better than it used to, you get an acknowledgement and don't have any sums to do.\"</p> <h2>Moira's right - you can do your return in 20 minutes</h2> <p>Self-assessment returns needn't eat into your quality time. Most taxpayers can fill in the form in 20 minutes - or even less. After all, professional form fillers, such as accountants, who can charge as much as \u00a3300 for holding your hand, often manage to do it in 10.</p> <p>Follow our DIY tax expert guide - and help prove Moira Stuart's assertion on all those posters, press adverts and TV spots that \"tax needn't be taxing\".</p> <p>\u2022 Clear your head and concentrate on the task. Like cooking or carpentry, preparation is key. Clear some table or even floor space - you'll need it for all the paperwork. Assemble pencils and an eraser - it's less taxing on the nerves - and only ink in the figures (the form is machine-read so black is best) when you are sure of what you are doing.</p> <p>\u2022 Dig out your paperwork. You will need details of items both taxed at source and untaxed. These will include records of your earnings from work or retirement pay (including the state pension); any perks from work; savings interest taxed at source; untaxed interest; dividends from shares; property rental income and any self-employment. Remember your self-assessment return covers the period from April 6 2007 to April 5, 2008. Anything dated before or after the year does not count.</p> <p>\u2022 Put each of these categories into a pile so you can add up the figures. The form only requires totals - so unless the taxman decides to probe your affairs, the Revenue only needs to know your overall bank and building society interest - not each individual amount.</p> <p>\u2022 You may need \"supplementary\" pages if you have employment, self-employment or property earnings or other less usual income sources such as capital gains. If you have previously sent in a form, the printed version the Revenue sent will probably include the pages you need.</p> <p>\u2022 Start with employment or pension returns. You will need your P60, which details how much your place of work or pension provider paid in 2007-08 and how much tax was deducted via PAYE. Don't worry - you won't have to pay again but this amount forms the basis for any tax due on other items. </p> <p>\u2022 The P11D will detail perks such as company cars or healthcare plans. </p> <p>\u2022 Fill in the section for bank and building society interest. You will have to pay more tax if your total takes you into the 40% higher rate tax band. Do the same for any dividends you received from shares.</p> <p>\u2022 All you need for any self-employment is how much came in, and how much you spent on the business if the turnover is \u00a330,000 or below.</p> <p>\u2022 When you've filled in the form - that's it. You don't have to do calculations as the Revenue will work out how much you owe by January 31 (or are due back if you're lucky) provided you return the form by October 31. </p> <p>\u2022 Form-filling and paying tax are never fun activities so don't complete the form listening to heavy metal - if you need background noise, a soothing sonata is miles better. </p> <p>Don't forget to remove distractions such as children and pets, and turn off the phone. Once you've signed the form, sit back and have a cup of tea.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Levene is author of Tax Saving Handbook, a Which? Essential Guide.</p>",
  "<p>In the early noughties, over a period of four years and three big books, Niall Ferguson developed an argument for which he would become famous - or infamous, depending on your view. The British empire, he argued, had done good things as well as bad, and its rightful, if reluctant, heir was the United States of America. \"I believe,\" he declared, in the six-part Channel 4 series that accompanied Colossus (2004), that \"the United States has the capacity to do even more good for the world than the British empire did 100 years ago.\" Whether or not it would exercise that capacity was another issue, and in Empire (2003) he worried that \"in the absence of formal empire it must be open to question how far the dissemination of western 'civilisation' - meaning the Protestant-Deist-Catholic-Jewish mix that emanates from modern America - can safely be entrusted to Messrs Disney and McDonald\". Colossus advanced three reasons why the project would probably fail: a manpower deficit (not enough Ivy League-educated Americans \"willing to work in hot places\"); attention deficit (it isn't enough to invade a country, enforce elections, then leave - a responsible empire stays long enough to establish free trade, free movement of capital and parliamentary democracy); and a looming financial deficit caused, specifically, by the promise of social security and Medicare to an ageing population, and America's increasing reliance on foreign and especially Chinese capital. The United States, he told the cameras sternly, \"is heading for a credit crunch\". </p> <p>When we talked a few weeks ago, in a small library at the top of his Mayfair club, the Savile (established in 1868, at the height of the British empire), this last statement seemed particularly prescient, except it was the bankers, not OAPs, who seemed to be bringing the American imperium to its knees - literally, when treasury secretary Hank Paulson knelt before the Democratic speaker of the house of representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and begged her (in vain, as it turned out) to help him pass his $700bn rescue package. </p> <p>On one thing at least Ferguson agreed with her: \"I don't think the solution is defensible,\" he said, \"unless the taxpayers get an equity stake.\" This has, of course, turned out to be the model that most governments have preferred; a model that looks, in effect, like nationalisation. \"Well, it would be if it was majority control. But we're talking here about 20% stakes. That's a pragmatic solution to a massive financial crisis. You don't need to be a socialist to favour it.\" </p> <p>Ferguson is in little danger of being called a socialist. The Ascent of Money, his latest TV series (accompanied by a book, naturally), begins with a spirited defence of moneylenders. \"I want to show you that money is the foundation of human progress, and the ascent of money has been indispensable to the ascent of man\" - a position that seems more counterintuitive with each passing day and each passing bank. \"His pages are hot with proof-stage tyre-marks,\" James Buchan recently noted in these pages, \"as he goes into violent reverse to escape from under collapsing arguments.\" One back-covering gambit is to argue that markets simply reflect human nature. \"They are subject to volatility just as we are, and to herd behaviour, booms and busts.\" He does not believe, as even the keenest free marketeers now surely must, that these tendencies are an indication that the system needs rethinking; all that's required is a touch more regulatory attention than before. As he put it in a recent column: \"The Securities and Exchange Commission slumbered, [and] Wall Street's biggest players danced on a volcano of leverage.\" </p> <p>He compares the US government itself to an investment bank. \"It has huge off-balance-sheet liabilities\" - social security and Medicare - \"and at some point those are going to come home to roost.\" There are those who point out that Ferguson's preferred model of US behaviour, as an evangelist for liberal democracy, backed by military force if necessary, is also fantastically expensive. The Iraq war alone, according to the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz and the Harvard public policy lecturer Linda Bilmes, will end up costing the US $3trillion, and Ferguson argued for that war. </p> <p>He rejects Stiglitz's calculations - \"if you take his figure and relate it to US GDP, it comes out at about 1.1% of GDP. By the standards of 20th-century wars, this is a small war\" - but says he regrets his support for the invasion. As he tells it now, he was largely concerned that Saddam should be deposed. \"I never had a neoconservative position on it, because I quickly realised that they really didn't have the imperial mindset . . . I underestimated how incompetently the occupation would be handled.\" He knows, however, that he is making this argument in light of a far more bullish statement, at the end of The Cash Nexus (2001), \"that the greatest disappointment facing the world in the 21st century [is] that the leaders of the one state with the economic resources to make the world a better place lack the guts to do it\". He says he regrets that, too - \"now that critique looks far too much like I'm a shill for what comes later, that I'm essentially saying to the neocons: bring it on. It's easy to forget that was written in 2000, when it still seemed unlikely that Bush would win.\" </p> <p>As it is, the US is bogged down in Iraq and engaged in an unedifying scramble to save its economy at home. The Washington consensus, which Ferguson describes in The Ascent of Money as a wishlist \"that would have gladdened the heart of a British imperial administrator\", looks irretrievably battered - and yet he refuses to blame any erstwhile masters of the universe. \"We're all to blame,\" he says instead, in a typically goalpost-moving manoeuvre. \"Who do we know who wasn't in some measure playing this game, the housing game? Who could resist the deal? We lend you all the money you can afford, and you go speculate on the property market.\" Surely that's a bit rich. After all, as he argues in The Ascent of Money, the essence of cash - long ago severed from anything as concrete as gold - is trust. We should behave responsibly, yes - but we should also be able to trust those in charge of our financial institutions to do the same. \"We need to educate people better than we currently do,\" he replies smoothly. \"Part of the point of the book is to try to understand this. It's not as if only the people who work in the City should understand this - it's not that complicated. And the stuff that's too complicated to understand probably is too complicated to do - that's part of the story of this crisis.\" </p> <p>Ferguson's parents, a doctor and a teacher of physics, instilled in him a belief in \"education as a sort of good in itself - because the best kind of life was led by educated people. To be educated was to appreciate life more, and to be freed from the drudgery of manual labour.\" Access to education, for him, trumps everything - \"I can't think of anything I would rather do with my money than buy my children\" - he has three - \"the best possible education. And I can't think of anything I would rather do later in life, once I've educated them, than try to make that quality of education available to more people.\" This would be done through an increase of scholarships to fee-paying schools, as well as an improvement of comprehensives, an ambition he says he shares with David Cameron, whom he admires for being a \"true Liberal Tory\".</p> <p>He must have been one of the few children who noticed that an animating crisis in Mary Poppins was a run on a bank; less surprising is his memory of rats in the streets after the rubbish collectors' strike in the 70s, which engendered an enduring scepticism about the Labour party (though, \"like any intelligent teenager\" he was briefly an ardent Labour supporter and briefly a Scottish nationalist - \"I'm promiscuous that way\"). When he arrived at Oxford, he was \"attracted to the somewhat obnoxious character of the young Thatcherites, which had its sort of punk dimension because it was so easy to outrage the leftwing majority - all these public schoolboys who were either in the Labour club or the Social Democrats, and they actually were boring. I can remember a particular party celebrating the deployment of cruise and Pershing missiles, which was just designed to upset the CND people.\" </p> <p>He admits to having been \"an ardent Thatcherite\" because of her monetary policies, and her stance on the cold war, but objects to the sobriquet \"rightwing\", which has followed him ever since. His own description of his politics is not necessarily any more helpful. \"I was never a very convincing social conservative, and always avoided associating myself with that part of the broader conservative movement ... And since the Labour party caved in and abandoned socialism, and the Soviet Union caved in and abandoned communism, my job was done - by 1989-90, that period of my life was over ... I would say I'm a 19th-century liberal, possibly even an 18th-century one. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Gladstone. My fundamental tenets are concerned with freedom of the individual; the market isn't perfect, but it's the best available way of allocating resources.\" Though Smith and Gladstone had very different positions on, say, distributive justice. </p> <p>After his undergraduate degree - George Monbiot, a flatmate, remembers him being preternaturally collected and focused - Ferguson did postgraduate work at Oxford and then Cambridge, keeping himself financially afloat by writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph and book reviews for the Daily Mail under assumed names, before becoming a fellow, then professor of history at Oxford. At the Mail he met his wife, Sue Douglas, who has since been editor of the Sunday Express and, briefly, creative director at the troubled literary agency PFD. Since 2001 he has commuted between the US, where he was a professor of financial history at NYU before moving to Harvard in 2004, and their Oxfordshire farmhouse; in his acknowledgments to The Ascent of Money, he thanks Douglas for putting up with the fact that he lives in another country for half the year.</p> <p>Ever since his first book, Paper and Iron (1995, about Hamburg business and German politics, 1897-1927), or his second, a two-volume history of the Rothschilds (1998), financial motives have run like a seam through all Ferguson's books, even those that are ostensibly not about money at all. He believes, as he argues in the new book, that \"financial history is the essential backstory behind all history\"; it is an approach that is both illuminating and sets him apart, but critics such as Stephen Howe, a professor of the history and culture of colonialism at Bristol University, worry that in Empire and Colossus in particular, the instinct for a cost-benefit analysis has precluded the humanity that marked The Pity of War (1998), which was about \"blood and tears as much as cash\". Ferguson replies that he spends many pages in Empire detailing the ravages of the slave trade, and quoting Indians who suffered in the Indian mutiny (\"The empire book wears its learning lightly,\" as he puts it). Which is true - but Howe notes that only one African writer is mentioned in the notes for Empire, and that many present-day historiographers of the Indian experience are ignored. More worrying is the method of argument, which details atrocities and then tends to describe them as hiccups on the road to progress, or points out that they are dwarfed by other, greater crimes - for example, following a description of a soldier shooting a disabled child by saying it wasn't as bad as Nazi behaviour, because that was systemic. </p> <p>Part of Ferguson's argument for a resumption of a liberal empire (assumed to be western) is that \"the experiment with political independence, especially in Africa, has been a disaster for most poor countries\". But this conveniently ignores the fact that colonisation significantly weakened a colony's bargaining power, already complicated by infrastructure geared towards export rather than stability; a situation that has latterly been exacerbated by free trade requirements imposed by more powerful countries and multinationals that make sure to protect themselves. These have resulted, in some places, in impressively free economies that are nonetheless in negative growth, and will bear the brunt of the current downturn. \"Misgovernment is misgovernment,\" he insists. \"And you can pretty quickly change the institutional rules of a country for better or for worse.\" As for protectionism, \"I'm in favour of free trade, period. Particularly free trade in agriculture. We have no excuse whatsoever for denying the world that. We have a small number of farmers, they're pretty well off. The Doha round ought to be able to create a free-trade regime of which Africa would probably be the principal beneficiary. As you can see, I'm just a doctrinaire liberal at heart - quite why I keep getting called rightwing is only mysterious to me. I'm just a liberal fundamentalist.\" </p> <p>It's a position that has made him friends in interesting places. He denies suggestions that Colossus, specifically, was written with half an eye on influencing the White House - but he became, for a time, one of John McCain's foreign policy advisers. \"I must say that since he won the nomination, which I was very happy about, I've played virtually no role. In fact, I've played no role. Because, uh\" - he is suddenly, uncharacteristically halting - \"how to describe it? - I felt much less ... enthused, I think is probably the word, now that it's between him and Obama. And I felt much more uncomfortable with some of the positions he has had to take in order to secure the conservative vote.\" </p> <p>There are those who feel a similar unease about him. Perhaps Alan Bennett put it best when he argued that, for a certain kind of historian, the kind mocked in his play The History Boys, \"the contrary view pays dividends\". Ferguson denies this, fiercely: \"I'm not a contrarian for its own sake. I'm not interested in defending positions that I don't believe in, even at dinner after a few drinks.\" Others, such as Paul Kennedy, who in 1987 wrote a landmark work on the rise and fall of empires, simply believe he should play to his strengths - hard economics, economic history, bond markets, 20th-century war - instead of \"pontificat[ing] on empire\". The Ascent of Money returns to those strengths, albeit in popular form, and takes a long view. Perhaps, Ferguson argues, the current crisis is like a great Darwinian dying, which will be followed by hardier, more evolved forms of financial life. The irony is that it is liberal fundamentalists such as Ferguson who may these days find themselves in danger of extinction. </p> <h2>Ferguson on Ferguson</h2> <p>\"In writing this book, I have frequently been asked if I gave it the wrong title. The Ascent of Money may seem to sound an incongruously optimistic note ... Yet it should now be obvious ... just how far our financial system has ascended since its distant origins among the moneylenders of Mesopotamia ... I remain convinced that, until we fully understand the origin of financial species, we shall never understand the fundamental truth about money: that ... financial markets are like the mirror of mankind, revealing every hour of every working day the way we value ourselves and the resources of the world around us. It is not the fault of the mirror if it reflects our blemishes as clearly as our beauty.\"</p> <p>The value of a long-term (4,000 year) perspective is that it runs counter to our very human impulse to over-react to immediate events. I embarked on writing The Ascent of Money anticipating that a major liquidity crisis would strike financial markets at some point in the near future. As it turned out, the credit crunch which began in August 2007 reached its climax exactly a month before publication. Amid the widespread panic of the last few weeks, many people may have feared that the world was on the brink of a new Great Depression. The Ascent of Money makes it clear that, while this is the most serious financial crisis since the 1970s, it is very unlikely to produce as big a macroeconomic calamity as the 1930s. What recent events illustrate is the value of the evolutionary theory of finance that I sketch in the conclusion of my book. When I first started warning of a \"great dying\" of banks, people were incredulous. The extinction of investment banks shows just how Darwinian finance can be. But even that shock will not catapult us back to the stone age.</p>",
  "<p>As I drove westwards along the A8, the purple hills of the Massif des Maures were rising towards a clear bluebell sky. Cradled within the Var between Fr\u00e9jus and Hy\u00e8res lies a bewitching hinterland, a low mountain range known in Proven\u00e7al as Lei Mauro: the Sombre Ones. Even today, access to this thickly forested expanse is not easy. There are not many paths or roads, and villages and towns are few and far between. Less than two hours from Nice airport, the massif - once a smugglers' haven - remains a relatively mysterious land, racked by winds and aridity.</p> <p>Until half a century ago, the Maures slopes had been silvery with olive trees, but in 1956 disaster struck. February frosts dropped beneath minus seven and the trees were blighted. Many farmers dug up their groves and replanted them with vines, but a few clung to the knowledge that the olive is the tree of eternity; they cut back the damaged trunks and waited for new shoots to appear. I was on my way to an olive farm some English friends had recently bought near Cuers in the Plaine des Maures. This was to be their first harvest and they were struggling; the 60 trees were already dropping their fruit. It was only late October, usually considered too early to harvest. </p> <p>I stopped in the little town of Brignoles (Brignolo in Proven\u00e7al) to buy gifts, but it was lunchtime. Everywhere had closed. I strolled the empty streets, passing a faded sign, hand-painted on a building, advertising Noilly Prat vermouth - classic Provence - to Le Caf\u00e9 de l'Univers in the main square where a blackboard offered the dish of the day at \u20ac8.50. The sun was shining and there was not a tourist in sight. The clock on the H\u00f4tel de Ville was 10 minutes slow. People were rising from tables, wandering off to buy copies of the Var-Matin, leaving their bags. No one seemed bothered about theft. During these brief, out-of-season months, the Proven\u00e7al communities seem to return to their former selves.</p> <p>A freshly baked loaf, big enough for four, was placed in front of me. I ordered the chef's special, roe deer. I rarely eat game, but I opted for the seasonal dish. To accompany my saut\u00e9 de Chevreuil \u00e0 l'ancienne et p\u00e2tes armoni\u00e8res, the waiter delivered a pitcher of organic red from the nearby Domaine La Lieue. My bill was \u20ac17. </p> <p>Back along the country lanes, smoke columns rose, rich with autumn perfumes. Late October was busy with clearing and burning. The grapes were pressed, the chestnuts, a local speciality, had been harvested and the olives were still to come. </p> <p>My friends' farm is buried at the remote end of a winding, rutted track semicircled by purple mountains. When I arrived, Clive and Sarah were in the groves laying nets at the feet of their trees. They were being helped by two young Americans I had recommended. Tommy and Shawna had both helped at my own olive farm overlooking the Bay of Cannes. When we bought it more than 20 years ago, the house needed complete renovation and the land was a jungle. It was two years before we could afford to cut back the 10 acres, and then we discovered we had 68 400-year-old olive trees. We planted another 200 saplings and today we have an appellation d'origine contr\u00f4ll\u00e9e for our oil. </p> <p>The four of them waved as I approached. Tommy and Shawna had met at my place on the WWOOF programme. World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms offers first-hand experience of organic or ecologically sound farming to those who might not otherwise encounter such environments. It is also intended as a meeting point, where living together is an exchange of languages, cultures and ideas, and it offers the volunteers the opportunity to explore new countries while sharing in the lives of rural communities. Anyone can join, whatever their age, background or experience. \"WWOOFers\" pay nothing for their accommodation. It's a chance to travel, participate and beat the current financial downturn. </p> <p>I was trying to persuade my British friends to convert their barn into sleeping quarters and sign up as WWOOF hosts. All over the Var and the Alpes-Maritimes, farms are opening their doors to volunteer workers. It's a brilliant arrangement which, for me, echoes the traditions of olive farming. The harvesting of olives is a social event, bringing together families and neighbours to gather, eat and celebrate a crop that has been a cornerstone of Mediterranean cuisine and livelihoods for thousands of years. </p> <p>Clive and Sarah's trees were a mere 30 years old and had been pruned hard so there was no need to climb tall ladders to reach the fruit. The work is not dangerous, though it demands full days and is painstaking: picking each fruit individually, rather than beating them off the branches with batons, you discover muscles you never knew you had. Hours can be spent on hands and knees collecting fallen olives into baskets, but the tasks are usually achieved in the sunshine and mealtimes are convivial and hearty. </p> <p>Once the nylon nets had been correctly positioned - reaching to the branches' farthest tips in order to capture all falling fruit - we adjourned to a wooden table outside the barn where our host opened a bottle of C\u00f4te de Provence ros\u00e9. \"We were unprepared,\" worried Clive. Here in Provence, the adage is that Ste Catherine's day, November 25, is when the oil-rich fruit is ready to gather. Mills rarely press before the third week of November. But by late October Clive's olives were black, falling and being gobbled by birds. </p> <p>Along the roadsides I had observed other farmers laying nets in readiness, and fortunately not 30km from Clive's farm I had also discovered a mill, Moulin Loube, which was ready to start pressing the following day; farmers were already queuing to turn their early-season fruits into oil. I suggested Clive book an appointment and we'd work as a team. Although my own olives were calling, I offered to help bring in the crop.</p> <p>Before setting to work we made a swift trip to Le Luc, to the estate of Guy and Anne Meulnart, whose domain, La Bernarde, produces some of the finest mixed-variety wines in the Var. Although I had never met this couple, they greeted us like long-lost friends. </p> <p>Their vendage had been completed mid-September, three weeks ahead of schedule. Due to lack of rain the quantity of wine delivered was worryingly low but the quality, Guy assured me, remained excellent. It was 35 years since this winery had used pesticides, but they had never applied for organic certification. Too much bureaucracy, said Anne in her smoky drawl. After a tour of their pristine caves, we staggered out cradling magnums of superb red.</p> <p>Over the following days, from dawn to dusk, we picked olives by hand, stretching, reaching from stepladders, careful not to bruise the fruit lest they bleed their oil and grow mildewy and acidic. I set aside some of the best fruit for bottling as table olives. These we washed thoroughly and left to stand for four days in water, refreshed daily, before pickling in brine and bay leaves for several months. </p> <p>The weather was mild and sunny, the mood upbeat. We cooked as a team - grilling local Sisteron lamb chops, baking Mediterranean bass with herbs from the garden - ate by candlelight at a big oval table in the kitchen, opened Guy and Anne's exquisite magnums and talked until after midnight. Each day's haul averaged 80 kilos of fruit. Not bad for novices. </p> <p>Once the harvest was in, Clive and Sarah delivered their 18 brimming crates of olives to the Moulin Loube, and I accompanied Tommy and Shawna to the chestnut fair at nearby Gonfaron, where le primeur est arriv\u00e9 - the local alternative to beaujolais nouveau. The cooperative was offering tastings and bottles were on sale for \u20ac4 apiece. In another week or two, their shelves would also be lined with the new season's olive oil. Moving through the throng of Proven\u00e7als poring over stalls laden with marrons glac\u00e9s and olive oils - I bought two jars of rich chestnut honey - we continued on to the Tortoise Village of Gonfaron. </p> <p>This area's low-lying mountains are famed for their colonies of Testudo hermanni hermanni, Hermann's tortoise, fast becoming extinct in France due to forest fires and urbanisation. The village's man-made enclosures replicate the tortoises' natural habitat and they are free to roam while remaining carefully protected against predators. Although the village's primary aim is the conservation of its native breed, it also boasts 1,500 examples from 20 other tortoise species, some of which hail from as far afield as Madagascar. The park, open all year round, offers an excellent outing for children, particularly as there is a donkey sanctuary across the lane.</p> <p>Sarah and Clive, triumphant with 57 litres of oil fresh from the mill, met us in the old town of Collobri\u00e8res, the capital of the Maures. Perched on a rocky spur, Collobri\u00e8res is where France's cork industry (taught to them by the Spanish!) was born. After lunch at La Petite Fontaine, washed down with ros\u00e9 from the town's cooperative, it was warm enough to sit out beneath the plane tree, which was shedding leaves the colour of ripe pears. My friends proudly presented me with a bottle of their first season's oil. We said our farewells. Tommy and Shawna were intending to spend some days trekking the Var hinterland, while I was returning to my olive farm to prepare for our own harvest.

  "<p>Thanks to the movie, people tend to assume that they know about John Updike's The Witches of Eastwick: it's the one where a hammy devil sexes up some frustrated divorcees. This isn't totally accurate. Set in the early 70s, the book is as much a satire on baby-boomer liberationism as an amused updating of witchcraft lore. </p> <p>Alexandra, Sukie and Jane, the witches, have supernatural powers deriving from their status as divorced women in their sexual prime. All three are involved with married men before Darryl Van Horne appears on the scene. Alexandra is a good deal less skinny than Cher, Jane is nastier than Susan Sarandon's character, and Van Horne is a shambling, bisexual impresario with a mask-like face and, we're told, ice-cold semen. When a younger rival marries him, the trio give her cancer. </p> <p>Witches was Updike's first sustained effort to put female characters centre-stage. While the writing, as always, is permanently cranked up to 11, the women are impressively realised figures. At the same time, there's a weird double-vision at work. The idea of sexuality as a kind of witchcraft is pitched as an ironic exaggeration of a small town's fear of liberated women. Yet the tongues wagging against the central characters emerge from a post-60s backdrop that's imagined in a distinctly small-town way. The witches' most bitter enemies are self-righteous liberals, and we hear a fair bit about drug-addled hippies, bomb-throwing war protesters and scary black people. Updike's attitude towards these culture-war cliches is mysterious; he doesn't always play them strictly for laughs. But perhaps, as Margaret Atwood wrote at the time, \"any attempt to analyse further would be like taking an elephant gun to a puff pastry: an Updike should not mean but be\".</p> <p>A similar proviso applies, in spades, to Updike's latest novel, which catches up with the three women as they get to grips with mortality. At the end of Witches, they remarried and went their separate ways. Alexandra has ended up in New Mexico with her laconic former art teacher; the others have stayed behind on the east coast - Jane as the wife of an effete Boston Brahmin, Sukie as a romantic novelist married to a loutish salesman. All three husbands die, of natural causes, and the ageing former witches get in touch with one another. Earth-motherish Alexandra is the main point-of-view character, as before. Jane, still cynical and malicious, though now addicted to puns, has become rich. Sukie, the sexy one, has lost half her lung function to emphysema but is otherwise herself. They cook up a plan: why not spend a summer in Eastwick? </p> <p>First, though, Updike spends 100 pages lavishing his descriptive resources on an account of their earlier adventures in package tourism. Alexandra responds to widowhood by taking a guided tour of the Canadian Rockies, where they use different money and a fellow tourist who resembles her dead husband disappoints her by referring to his late \"partner\" (\"This fag had been wasting her time\"). </p> <p>Next, she and Jane take a trip to Egypt, which turns out to contain pyramids, tombs and a museum, all of which are reviewed at length, plus potentially scary Muslims. Finally, all three women visit China, where food is eaten with chopsticks. (\"This was China, teeming under Heaven's mandate.\") The strange thing about this section, apart from its narrative pointlessness, is the self-consciousness with which Updike sets about transcribing stereotypes concerning foreign parts. One page-long sentence inscrutably catalogues American notions of China, from \"dragon ladies, rickshaws and comic-strip pirates\" to \"competitor for the dwindling global supply of oil\", via \"tender seedbed of budding free enterprise\". </p> <p>When the action shifts to Eastwick, a plot of sorts emerges. Chris, the younger brother of the girl they cursed, now \"an overweight poof\", plans to take magical vengeance. This plotline is resolved in an unexpected way (Sukie seduces him with the aid of a strap-on dildo), but not before the women have all got naked at a defensive witches' sabbath, leading to a description of \"once thick and springy curls turning gauzy and gray, pubic clocks ticking unseen, decade after decade, in their underpants\". As you'd expect, there are cranky discussions of mobile phones, facial piercings, and how \"all this hooking up the young people do\" is soulless and mechanical in comparison to their adulterous high jinks in the 70s. Cancelling out the earlier book's amoralism, Jane is dramatically punished for her sins. Meanwhile, Alexandra has an epiphany during a meal with her grandchildren: she will live on through her descendents, \"layers of inheritance and affinity invisibly ramifying\". </p> <p>Updike has had a long and distinguished career. In some quarters, the Rabbit books are said to put him in the company of Saul Bellow and Philip Roth. Like many of his minor works, The Widows of Eastwick lends more weight to the view of him as an almost spookily unreflective channeller and prettifier of baby-boom Americana, with a selectively blind eye to various uglinesses and a sideline in overwritten vagina-descriptions. All the same, whatever you make of his writing style, there's no denying that the facility with which he turns out those lovingly cadenced, alliterative sentences is an awe-inspiring spectacle. In spite of its absurdities, the new book keeps this up, every now and then throwing out a simile (an old churchgoer's corpse \"as brittle and dry as a flower pressed in a Bible\") that even his detractors would have to call pretty good.</p>",
  "<p>Ian Mortimer doesn't hold with any fancy notion about the past being impossible to know. Not for him the </p> <p>postmodern practice of confining historical discussions to the sources and letting \"once upon a time\" take care of itself. What Mortimer wants is living history, loud and close. In The Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England he sets out to re-enchant the 14th century, taking us by the hand through a landscape furnished with jousting knights, revolting peasants and beautiful ladies in wimples. It is Monty Python and the Holy Grail with footnotes and, my goodness, it is fun.</p> <p>Mortimer's argument, spelled out in a thoughtful epilogue, is that these pleasures become possible not by laying critical sense to one side, but by embracing an altogether different approach. Statistics are all very well, but unless they come clothed in flesh it is hard to know them in your bones. You can read about the Black Death until you're blue (or, rather, yellow with funny red blotches) in the face. You can know it wiped out a third of Europe's population, but until you've seen a man sobbing as he tells you he has buried five sons, or watched as wild pigs chomp on the remains of your loved ones, then history remains a glorified spreadsheet of society's profit and loss. So instead Mortimer goes hunting for scraps of lived experience with which to re-animate his chosen patch of the past.</p> <p>This, of course, is easier said than done: the middle ages are remote to us. Official documents provide poor pickings when it comes to building the kind of narratives which grip and won't let go. Apart from the ever-useful Paston Letters, written by an East Anglian yeoman family as they scrambled to prominence in the wake of the Black Death, Mortimer is obliged to scavenge where he can. Yet still he finds enough material to shape some sharp vignettes: a peasant playing bagpipes in a field for a female acrobat, or the dizzying sight of 10 different kinds of shop-bought sugar.</p> <p>Mortimer is lucky, too, to have the work of Chaucer on hand for some vivid colouring-in. Quite apart from using The Canterbury Tales as a source book for life on the road in the 14th century, he quarries the great unfinished masterpiece for evidence of the high medieval mindset. Read The Wife of Bath's Tale, suggests Mortimer, and you learn not just about the pilgrims' experiences with skittish horses and poor inn suppers but also of how one woman managed to buck the patriarchal order, living well and joyfully. In Mortimer's skilful handling, the Wife's inner life, revealed in her linguistic riffs, becomes as telling as anything five centuries later by Freud.</p> <p>Mortimer also tries to bring us living history by using the second person and the present tense throughout. So, you are travelling into the city, you are sitting down at table, you are eyeing up a cross-looking band of outlaws and deciding whether it is safe to run. It is a verbal tic, the present tense especially, which has become the default voice for documentaries and which is now creeping into history writing. This relentless presentism can seem irritating, until you remember that the perfect tense, in which history has conventionally been told, is equally arbitrary. As Mortimer points out, if you are to experience the 14th century the way he intends, then you must do so in the unspooling moment, oblivious to what lies ahead.</p> <p>What makes these slightly awkward stylistic choices bearable is that Mortimer knows what he is doing. He has previously written three very well received biographies of medieval kings which are both readable and erudite (much rarer in popular writing about the middle ages than you might think). His background as a professional archivist throws a cloak of probity over a project which might otherwise have veered towards Ladybird territory. If he sometimes cites a secondary text which seems to be growing whiskers - for instance WG Hoskins's 1953 classic on the English landscape - then you feel reassured that no other source will quite do.</p> <p>The result of this careful blend of scholarship and fancy is a jaunty journey through the 14th century, one that wriggles with the stuff of everyday life. On many occasions this wriggling is quite literal: entrails seem to be everywhere, from the pigs' insides slopped in a bucket to the traitors who are forever having their bowels hooked out and burned in front of them.</p> <p>Moments of peace and beauty seem rare, especially for anyone beneath the rank of merchant. Some of the best although also the most unnerving passages in the book describe what sounds like an assault course of dirt, danger and low-grade disapproval from the chorus of busybodies who squat on the sidelines watching your every move. For if one thing is clear in Mortimer's deft summary of life in the high medieval period, it is that you are never alone. Any sense of yourself as an individual, with particular desires or needs, always buckles in the face of the greater demands of the community. </p> <p>That isn't to deny the book's many lighter moments. Mortimer has a sharp eye for those \"well-I-never\" factoids. For instance, until the beginning of the 13th century there was no difference between right and left shoes, which must have been useful if you were getting dressed in the dark (and, chances are, you were). The phrase \"Women and children first\" had a different meaning: the quickest way to lighten a sinking ship was to throw any wimple-wearers overboard. Finally, and quite the best of all, in 1337 Edward III passed a law forbidding anyone to play football - on pain of death. He wanted everyone to practise archery instead.</p>",
  "<p>As Tottenham prepare for three Premier League matches in six days that will shape their future, another forlorn voice can be heard from the gathering of dissenters that passes for a dressing-room these days. It is that of Luka Modric, the \u00a316.5m Croatian midfield player who was one of the substitutes against Udinese on Thursday night.</p> <p>\"I did my best but I was all alone in the middle,\" he said. \"I couldn't do any more. I was disappointed to start on the bench but it was the coach's decision.\"</p> <p>Modric's despair follows that voiced by David Bentley (\"We look like we don't know what we're doing\") and the respected figure of Jonathan Woodgate, who says the team is rudderless (\"We're worse than the Leeds team that went down.\")</p> <p>Modric has looked a misfit in the Premier League, as predicted by the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, and appears no more at home in Europe. The Croatian added: \"We started very well but it was an unfortunate goal we conceded and it was at the key moment in the match. In the second half we also started well but the red card [Jamie O'Hara was sent off in the 57th minute] was also unfortunate and after that it was very difficult to create chances. The red card made a mess of the team.\" </p> <p>But the German referee, Felix Brych, should not be allowed to take all the credit. Football, perhaps, should feel grateful to the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, who has unwittingly produced a template for how not to run a football club. First, a good manager in Martin Jol was sacked. Then, a director of football, Damien Comolli, was appointed even though such a role has never worked in British football. Then, crucially, the best players were sold and inferior ones brought in. That's Spurs for you - very attractive but not very bright.</p> <p>Now they must face up to playing Bolton tomorrow followed by Arsenal on Wednesday and Liverpool on Saturday. Defeats in these three matches would leave the club's position at the bottom of the Premier League looking hopeless and might seal the fate of manager Juande Ramos as well as that of Comolli.</p> <p>The latter has been seen as the more vulnerable of the two but the position is now so desperate that even his removal would be unlikely to change anything apart from placating the critics who say that if he knows better than the manager why not put him in charge?</p> <p>To make matters worse, Woodgate hobbled off on Thursday night while Ledley King made what is likely to be his cameo appearance for October. Spurs have now had three players sent off and conceded three penalties in two games. </p> <p>Ramos's record at Seville earned him respect but he did not look in the mood to inspire anyone when he shuffled out of the Udinese stadium after the match When he was asked how long he had got, he replied: \"I don't know because I don't control that. The Bolton game is very important for us now. It's a game with big tension on the pitch. We need to win. We must work each day in training to help the players get their confidence back.\" Should Comolli be sacked? \"I don't know anything about this,\" he said. \"Only the club knows what will happen to people.\" </p> <h2>How Bale is Spurs' jinx</h2> <p>There may be some hope on the horizon for Tottenham supporters dreaming of a first Premier League win of the season. Thanks to his sending off against Stoke last week Gareth Bale is banned for tomorrow's game against Bolton - which may be good news if a remarkable statistic can be taken as an omen: he has never won a league game during his 15 months at White Hart Lane.</p> <p><strong>Premier League</strong></p> <p><strong>With Bale</strong> P: 15 W: 0 D: 6 L: 9 F: 19 A: 30 GD: -11 Pts: 6</p> <p><strong>Without Bale</strong> P: 32 W: 11 D: 9 L: 12 F: 53 A: 45 GD: +8 Pts: 42</p>",
  "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has revealed that he was once a smoker but his liberal attitude is not expected to spare William Gallas, the Arsenal captain, from a club fine after he was photographed in the small hours of Thursday morning leaving a London nightclub with a cigarette in his mouth. </p> <p>Wenger will check the authenticity of the pictures and speak to Gallas to remind him of his responsibilities. The French defender was among a host of celebrities at the reopening of the Movida club, which was also attended by the Chelsea players Florent Malouda and Mikel John Obi. </p> <p>\"First, I have to speak to Gallas,\" said Wenger, before his own previous as a smoker came out. \"I did smoke but never a lot and never when I played. After, when I became a young coach, I sometimes had one [cigarette] because my assistant was smoking at three o'clock in the morning, when we had lost a big game. </p> <p>\"In France, we all smoke. I have seen buses in France that you would not believe, you do not see each other. When I was a player, nobody would ever tell you that you should not smoke. We were driving home in coaches. You had to open the windows in winter to see each other.\"</p> <p>Gallas is due to return to the team for tomorrow's visit to West Ham United after a thigh complaint and Wenger gave his full backing to the centre-half. But he did point out that his aversion to smoking was based on the affect it might have on the player's fitness and his reputation as a professional. \"Gallas has a responsibility as captain and that cannot be accepted,\" insisted the Arsenal manager. \"It is a public job with public responsibility. But there is smoking and there is smoking. I am sure you had players who were smoking 40 cigarettes a day.\"</p> <p>Wenger went on to claim that West Ham might now be title contenders had they hung on to their young stars years ago. \"They had a team to win the championship, if you take the players now [when they have matured],\" he said. \"[Joe] Cole, [Frank] Lampard, [Michael] Carrick, Rio Ferdinand. [Paolo] Di Canio played, too. They had an unbelievable team.\"</p> <p>He believes, though, that the club's new manager, Gianfranco Zola, can guide them towards success. \"Zola was an Arsenal player, he just went in the wrong direction [to Chelsea],\" remarked Wenger with a smile. \"I like him as a player and as a man.\"</p>",
  "<p>There used to be a National Lottery TV gameshow, Winning Lines, in which the booby prize for answering only one question correctly was a holiday to Spaghetti Junction. I don't know if anyone won the prize, or claimed it. But the conceit was clear: the Gravelly Hill interchange was the last place anyone would make a detour to visit. Now the School of Life, a new cultural enterprise offering \"ideas to live by\" is challenging these assumptions about where we should spend our vacations. This weekend it is organising a mini-break on the M1, to \"unearth the story of the motorway's construction, reveal the poetry of its monumental architecture, dine in its historic service stations and recover the utopian thrill of its early days\". The sightseers will meet historians, architects and one of the original serving staff at Leicester Forest East. A holiday at Heathrow is also in the offing.</p> <p>At last, I appear to be ahead of a trend. As a historian of daily life, I have visited unexciting places for ages. I once drove 230 miles to see a housing estate, at Chafford Hundred in Essex. And I may be the only person to eat their packed lunch under Spaghetti Junction, resting against one of the M6's supports. </p> <p>But they order these matters better in France. In 1982, Julio Cort\u00e1zar and Carol Dunlop spent a month living on the Autoroute du Soleil between Paris and Marseille, travelling in a VW camper van and stopping at all 65 rest stops. Their lovely mock-heroic account of the journey, The Autonauts of the Cosmoroute - published in English this year - inspired a genre of French travel writing. The likes of Fran\u00e7ois Maspero, Jean Rolin and Marc Aug\u00e9 embarked on Homeric odysseys along suburban commuter lines or the metro system. In their books, these supposedly banal non-places turn out to have rich interior lives; the point of the journey is not to escape into the exotic but to learn to live every day more creatively and intensely.</p> <p>It seems like a good model for our financially straitened and environmentally chastened times. The holiday on the M1 costs a mere \u00a395, including all travel and meals. And even if going up and down a motorway for fun isn't particularly green, the holidaymakers will be reducing their carbon footprint by travelling in a coach - appropriately enough, since this is how the first M1 sightseers experienced the motorway when it opened almost half a century ago.</p> <p>I am not suggesting we all need to spend our summer holidays sunbathing in service station car parks. Unless you are an anthropologist of the everyday, the charms of these places are an acquired, or perhaps never-acquired, taste. I found that Spaghetti Junction and Chafford Hundred were worth seeing, if you like motorway interchanges and housing estates, but not worth going to see. I did spend a pleasant weekend this summer at Newport Pagnell services, people-watching at Coffee Primo and exploring the nearby network of lakes, now a wetland centre, created out of gravel pits dug to build the M1. By Sunday afternoon, though, even Newport Pagnell had delighted me enough.</p> <p>But holidays can still be had without access to sea, sand or airport check-ins - and we have been there before. In the second world war, to discourage travel and save fuel, local councils organised Holidays at Home: open-air Shakespeare plays, donkey rides in suburban parks, even a regatta on the Thames in the East End. So how about taking time off work to spend more time with our family and friends, catch up on culture and explore our own neighbourhoods? It's carbon-neutral, recession-proof, you can't lose your luggage and there is no danger of being offered a complimentary cup of tea and a biscuit at Heathrow's Terminal 5. It sounds like the perfect holiday.</p> <p>\u2022 Joe Moran is the author of Queuing for Beginners </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:J.Moran@ljmu.ac.uk\">J.Moran@ljmu.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Flavio Briatore reasserted his authority in the Queens Park Rangers boardroom yesterday by sacking Iain Dowie as manager. There has been turmoil behind the scenes at the Championship club, where the chairman, Briatore, clashed with the vice-chairman, Amit Bhatia, after the latter released a personally signed statement pledging to reduce ticket prices at Loftus Road.</p> <p>Briatore telephoned Gianni Paladini to accuse the club's sporting director of undermining him and promised he would be sacked. Paladini, though, was spared at a meeting on Thursday attended by all the major powers and Briatore instead turned the knife on Dowie.</p> <p>The Italian has been unhappy with Dowie, who took over in May, for some weeks and suspected the manager had criticised him behind his back for a lack of support in the transfer market. Briatore helped to bring a clutch of players to the club, including Daniel Parejo, who is on loan from Real Madrid and on a huge contract by Championship standards. But Parejo and Emmanuel Ledesma, who joined on loan from Genoa, have not been in the starting line-up in recent games and Damiano Tommasi, the Italian midfielder, has yet to make a first-team appearance.</p> <p>Briatore is understood to have suggested yesterday that Dowie ought to start certain players in today's game at Reading. A disagreement ensued and the club statement announcing the termination of Dowie's contract with \"immediate effect\" swiftly followed. Gareth Ainsworth, the veteran midfielder, will take caretaker charge against Reading but he will not be the long-term appointment. The club have sounded out Terry Venables and Steve Cotterill and the board are undecided whether to go for a British or foreign coach. Early suggestions that Roberto Mancini, the former Internazionale manager, will come in are wide of the mark. Tommasi, having already been brought in, is a possibility and so is Alan Curbishley, the former West Ham manager.</p> <p>Briatore... who is supported on the QPR board by Bernie Ecclestone and Bhatia, the son-in-law of Lakshmi Mittal, whose family owns 20% of the club, now have a truce, but the possibility remains that the Mittals will try to buy out Briatore and Ecclestone.</p> <p>QPR have won one of their past six league matches and currently lie ninth in the table.</p>",
  "<p>Darren Hunter's criticism of Ronan Bennett's article on the film Hunger (Letters, October 24) is inaccurate: Bobby Sands was not imprisoned for an attack on the Balmoral Furniture Co, a charge of which he was acquitted. He was jailed for possession of a firearm, something that at the time was widespread. The context of the film is the refusal to accept anything less than political status, a category which the Thatcher government had unwisely withdrawn; and the right to free association with other prisoners, against the background of the government's obduracy in coming to terms with the fact that it should not be in Ireland at all. This determination is something that the film very graphically shows. </p> <p>What the hunger strikes did achieve was to make the government realise that it could not continue to rule in the old way, which has eventually led to the present political arrangements. Though when Bobby Sands said Ireland's revenge on Britain's departure would be the happy laughter of its children, he meant full independence, not a power-sharing arrangement.<br><strong>John McPartlin</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>For years, Visa Electron has been the poor relation of the card family. Dubbed the card banks give to people on the breadline, teenagers and those who can't be trusted with credit, some shops and websites turn their noses up at it.</p> <p>All in all, it is not generally viewed as a must-have. But now there is a very good reason for having one - it allows you to side-step Ryanair's sky-high debit- and credit-card charges, which can dramatically push up the cost of those \"free\" flights.</p> <p>Travellers have been shocked to discover that the low-cost airline has more than tripled what it charges for regular debit-card payments from \u00a31.20 to \u00a34. That is \u00a34 per person, per one-way flight, so a family of four buying \"free\" return flights would fork out \u00a332 in card fees alone. </p> <p>Outraged Guardian Money readers say the card fees belie Ryanair's claim to offer \"100% free flights\". The Office of Fair Trading says the fees are at the discretion of the company concerned, but tells companies they cannot hide \"non-optional\" charges. Ryanair blames credit-card companies for the change - it says it was unhappy at the unfavourable discrepancy between debit- and credit-card charges.</p> <p>However, there is a way of avoiding the new charge, and that is to get yourself a Visa Electron, as these do not incur any fee at all. You don't have to be a teenager or on a low income to get your hands on one. If you and your family fly a couple of times a year, it may be worth getting one.</p> <p>Electron is an unusual type of debit card, as it offers a restricted level of flexibility. Essentially, you can only pay for goods if you have enough money in your account. Only a small handful of UK banks - Halifax, Bank of Scotland, the Co-operative Bank and Abbey - issue them, according to Visa. Alliance &amp; Leicester offered them until last year, a bank spokesman says, but dropped them as a result of customer complaints that the cards were not accepted in enough stores and outlets.</p> <p>The Easycash basic bank account offered by the Halifax and Bank of Scotland comes with a Visa Electron debit card. Anyone can apply for this account, though it does not offer interest, overdrafts or a chequebook. The Co-op Bank account offering a Visa Electron is called Cashminder, also a basic bank account with no overdraft. An Abbey spokeswoman says people can request an Electron card on almost every Abbey current account.</p> <p>Interest in the Electron is growing. Chatroom users of money websites including <a href=\"http://MoneySavingExpert.com\">MoneySavingExpert.com</a> report bank staff noticing a big increase in the number of requests for them.</p> <p>Karen Bryan, a frequent traveller who runs the Europe a la Carte (<a href=\"http://europealacarte.co.uk\">europealacarte.co.uk</a>) travel advice website for people on a modest budget, recently opened a Halifax Easycash account after spotting the debit-card fee hike. \"I just leave a couple of hundred pounds in mine in case I want to book a flight,\" she says. \"It's quite common for different fees to be applied between credit and debit card, as they are in other businesses. I just don't know how they get away with a \u00a34 fee per flight, not per transaction. I think people would prefer the airlines to be more upfront about the charges. After all, a \u00a310 flight all-in and advertised as such is still a great deal.\"</p> <p>Ryanair says its choice of Electron as the only fee-free card is down to a deal to boost the card's popularity. \"We're working with Visa to promote the Visa Electron card, and we do so by encouraging all passengers booking on Ryanair to use it, as this enables passengers to avoid any optional debit- or credit-card handling fees,\" a spokesman for the budget airline says.</p> <p>However, its website says that, as a special offer to Visa Electron card holders, no handling fee will be charged for \"a limited period only\". Flights bought fee-free with Visa Electron cards began in 2004. The Electron promotion also allows the airline to continue to advertise its flight deals at rock-bottom prices despite much higher final costs for most customers.</p> <p>Ryanair's new \u00a34 fee brings debit cards into line with credit card payments, and joins the growing list of Ryanair charges to watch out for, including checked baggage, airport check-in and excess baggage fees.</p> <p>Giles Howard, a 42-year-old businessman from St Albans, Herts, says he was let down by the debit-card charge that he says was not up-front or made clear until his flight confirmation.</p> <p>Enticed by an advert for a \u00a32 Ryanair flight sent to him in an email, and having booked plenty of budget seats before, he was savvy enough to know he would have to book carefully to avoid add-ons. He painstakingly picked four \u00a32 return flights to France last month.</p> <p>Delighted at his \u00a38 bargain holiday, he was then gobsmacked to receive a flight confirmation email telling him he owed \u00a340. \"I knew I was going to pay with a debit card - usually the cheapest way - and I did check the running total after each selection to make sure that the total was as advertised,\" he says. \"But you certainly do not expect your method of payment to make a five-fold increase to the price.\"</p> <p>Ryanair disputes this and says that the terms and conditions of handling fees are made very clear. Of course, Howard would not have had to fork out \u00a340 if he had paid with Visa Electron - a detail he says he discovered too late.</p> <p>\"Even though it was still a cheap deal, I feel the airline relies on not many people having Electron cards to be able to advertise those flights at \u00a32,\" Howard says.</p> <p>In response, the Ryanair spokesman says that \"almost 20% of our customers book with Visa Electron\", and stresses that Howard benefited from its lowest fares.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading says it believes any decision over whether to charge for making payments by credit or debit card is one for the trading company. \"However, we are of the view that fixed non-optional charges should be included in all prices so that consumers are not misled,\" a spokesman says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://money@theguardian.com\">money@theguardian.com<br> </a></p>",
  "<p>There's an identifiable celebrity endorsement hierarchy and advertisers ignore it at their peril. Be too ambitious and you end up with David Beckham advertising your Sharpie pens and a collective \"Huh, what was that?\" from your target audience. But equally dangerous is the tendency to settle for a lesser celebrity like some lovesick Bridget Jones at a wedding jumping on the best man's sleazeball friend. A tragic case in point is the Paul Daniels Tescocompare.com advert where the septuagenarian illusionist, um, hilariously attempts to influence the viewer to choose Tescocompare.com by using mind magic. The advert is so obviously written for Derren Brown it's not funny but the terrifying boy magus clearly had the good sense to turn it down. Then Tesco no doubt went down the hierarchy of magicians to Paul Zenon, Criss Angel, David Berglas or, when they got really desperate, David Blaine.

  "<p>In John Waters' wonderful one-man show This Filthy World, the Prince of Puke discourses briefly on Cecil B Demented, his own homage to art cinema and pornography. The movie's characters, united by a fanatical love for arthouse movies, all get themselves tattooed with the name of their favourite director. Waters says that if he was in the same position as his characters, his own choice of inked auteur would be Joseph Losey.</p> <p>As Waters reminds us in his autobiography Shock Value, \"in order to understand bad taste it's first necessary to have extremely good taste.\" In choosing Losey, Waters proves that he has both. As a fan of the lush and the decadent, of overly stylised mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and intricate camerawork, of ripe colour and perfect framing (check the Sirkian excesses of Serial Mom and Polyester), Waters is a natural sucker for the Losey style.</p> <p>Losey, an American who fetched up in England after fleeing the blacklist, became one of the best British - yes, British - directors of the 1960s, a period when names like Polanski, Kubrick and Lester were attached to some of the most groundbreaking movies made in Britain. The local names often fare poorly by comparison. There is not a single movie made in the 1960s by, say, Tony Richardson that I'd particularly care to see again, but I have watched The Servant more times than perhaps any other movie, and expect to find even more riches in it over my next 20 viewings (it's perhaps worth noting it was the first \"dirty\" or adult movie I ever saw, and that initial impression has remained indelible).</p> <p>Losey arrived not only as an American Marxist who'd never had a proper class-system to sink his dialectical-materialist teeth into, but also as a director who'd apprenticed in the Poverty Row studios making movies like The Prowler and his marvellous, hard-to-see 1951 remake of Fritz Lang's M. He brought a real touch of Warner Brothers to his early British thrillers, and by the time he started collaborating with Harold Pinter - The Servant, Accident, The Go-Between - he had reached the kind of stylistic maturity that many directors never come close to achieving. This is the good taste side of Losey.</p> <p>The bad taste aspect came with critical acclaim, particularly of the Gallic/Cahiers du Cinema variety, as Losey became richer and more feted and more self-conscious. Veering into woefully misguided material like Modesty Blaise and the overripe Boom! and Secret Ceremony, his reputation was only intermittently salvaged by late-career masterpieces such as The Go-Between (which Atonement plunders relentlessly) and M Klein.</p> <p>Losey's reputation is still undeservedly insecure, but the new Losey box-set - along with David Caute's exemplary biography - is an invaluable place to begin understanding the greatness of this master-exile.

  "<p>The hero of this singular novel is first seen with an estate agent called Harriet, who is showing him round country houses. He is introduced with the curious phrase \"Jim Smith, as he called himself\". If he has another, real name, the reader never learns it. He is a Londoner who used to do something in the software industry and he is repeatedly described as \"cold\". He seems almost to be an experiment in how far the writer can burn off conventional signals for personality and likability in his leading character, leaving only a fiercely observational intelligence to guide the story. And yet, as we ought to expect from the writer of complex, magnificent novels such as Heart's Journey in Winter and A Good Place to Die, Buchan has his reasons. There turns out to be a good excuse for that apparently bland surname, which reaches back into Roman mythology. And what starts as a surgically obsidian comedy of town versus country manners becomes something far stranger, as layers are peeled off the palimpsest of the English landscape, and of literature itself.</p> <p>Jim buys Paradise Farm, which comes with a magnificently surly worker, John Walker. He \"smelled of grass cuttings and fag ash\". Like a contemporary Jean de Florette, Jim learns the rudiments of agriculture, and meets the locals. With the exception of the blind old Lord Bolingbroke, whose dissipated grace is wonderfully evoked, they are enjoyably monstrous - the seductive Mrs Dark, in particular, turns out to be aptly named during a splendidly awful dinner party at the house of the local billionaire and his trophy wife. Another diner is skewered thus: \"There was nothing contrary to social reason in Glory Gainer's evil glare.\"</p> <p>A large part of the novel's subject is the country itself, treated in modes both satirical and philosophical. Jim comes across his cow, got up by John Walker for a show: \"Her coat was brushed, watered, chalked and painted, so that she looked not like a cow but a sort of bovine prostitute.\" But he also has deeper thoughts about country pursuits: \"He supposed that what had begun as a distraction had overrun an entire way of life, and pastimes such as fox hunting and pheasant shooting had become the chief business of existence. It was as if some mysterious core to this way of life had vanished, leaving just the shell of its recreation.\" Much of the book stands as an elegy for such a disappearing or already disappeared way of life, in land encroached on by new-build suburbs, \"where all relations of space and time had been pulverised by the automobile\". But for the moment, some serenity is still possible: \"Here there was a style of British life, inarticulate and contented and withdrawn.\"</p> <p>Or some serenity would be possible, were there not also a haunting in progress. Paradise Farm and its environs seem to be inhabited by the shade of a woman who attended hippy parties there in the 1960s, and who might herself have been the incarnation of an ancient goddess. Buchan describes the apparitions in a dazzlingly indirect style, conjuring a thick weather of foreboding, as something passes by \"the hissing gloom by the window\" or a door opens on to \"an orphan grey light\". In such an atmosphere, Jim does well to acquire a dog, called Argos, who will live up, heartbreakingly, to his name.</p> <p>Jim's own continuing inscrutability, or purposeful blankness, at the heart of the story's narrative might put off some readers, but it also seems to be part of an argument. At one point, he is made to consider questions that cast him as a modern-day Hume: \"What if there were no principles of nature, only habitual conjunctions that people labelled cause and effect? What if there were no history, only the supposition that the past resembled the present, and the future would be more of the same? What if there were no self, just a compendium of sensations, impressions, wishes, fears, regrets?\"</p> <p>What if, indeed. There is a problem, though, to do with the inconsistency of Jim's pre-modern lack of \"character\". The narrator insists repeatedly on Jim's lack of culture, the fact (already difficult to swallow) that before the events of the novel he has never even set foot in a bookshop. It is surprising, then, that he is able to understand the ancient Greek spoken to him in a dream, particularly since later on he has to learn the Greek alphabet, along with Latin grammar, from the internet. A few pages after that, he has suddenly acquired an easy familiarity with ancient literature, as on a trip to London, city of \"long-legged girls\", he visualises himself as \"Tantalus in The Odyssey\". </p> <p>If Jim's rapid transformation into a classical scholar-detective does not come across as entirely persuasive, it does set up a richly compelling finale, as he translates the hellish mottoes above his lintels and burrows through the past of his land. Jim thinks of himself as Tantalus at a point where he has not realised that he is really an unlucky version of Odysseus - as his dog might have been able to tell him. His Penelope, on the other hand, understands this all too well, in a climactic recognition scene between lovers that is as powerful as it is unexpected, with Buchan brilliantly planting a silent, quasi-telepathic conversation running in parallel with the spoken words. The book's final paragraph is nothing short of magical.</p> <p>Perhaps out of confusion as to what it is that they have on their hands, the publishers suggest that The Gate of Air is a \"Victorian\" \"fireside spine-chiller\". Readers expecting that will be disappointed, for it is something like the opposite. The Gate of Air is perhaps not among Buchan's very best work, but he is a novelist who takes no literary convention for granted, and each book he writes is a discovery.</p>",
  "<p>How many old mobile phone handsets have you got lurking unused in the back of drawers at home? Probably at least two, according to new research from price comparison website <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a>, which next week launches a campaign to encourage people to help the environment, and possibly make a bit of cash, by recycling their old mobiles.</p> <p>As people regularly upgrade for the latest model, more than 1.5m handsets - many in working order - are thrown away each year because more than two-thirds of users fail to recycle them.</p> <p>\"The average person has two old mobiles, increasing to an average of three for those under 20. That's a huge number lying around that could be put to good use through recycling,\" says James Parker, commercial manager of mobiles and broadband at the website.</p> <p>Hazardous components - especially lead, cadmium and mercury in the batteries - can pose a threat to the environment if they are discarded in landfill sites. But working handsets can be reused, while those that are past it can be stripped down and their various components recycled.</p> <p>The bonus for consumers is that the companies that collect and process mobiles for reuse and recycling are willing to pay for some handsets, depending on the model, age and condition. It can be anything from a couple of quid to more than \u00a3200 for the newest, most popular models.</p> <p>Selling your phone to one of these outfits is straightforward. On websites like envirofone.com, Mazuma Mobile (<a href=\"http://mazumamobile.com\">mazumamobile.com</a>), Mobile2Cash (<a href=\"http://www.mobile2cash.co.uk\">mobile2cash.co.uk</a>) and Love2Recycle (<a href=\"http://www.love2recycle.com\">love2recycle.com</a>), which is partnering <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.com\">moneysupermarket.com</a> in the campaign, you can look up the price on offer for your phone.</p> <p>If you are happy to sell for that price, fill in your details online. You are usually sent a free padded mailing envelope. You can track the progress of your mobile on the website and, once processed, you will be sent a cheque, or the cash will be paid directly into your bank account.</p> <p>\"Customers come on to our site to renew their mobile contracts or look for a better deal, which often involves getting a new handset. So, as we're effectively pushing new phones into the market, we feel it's our responsibility to make people aware there are options for recycling,\" says Parker. The partnership's website, <a href=\"http://moneysupermarket.love2recycle.com\">moneysupermarket.love2recycle.com</a>, will pay an average \u00a325 to recycle an old phone.</p> <p>But this may be misleading. Many older models are worth very little, if anything at all, while a few top models are worth a lot more. Nokia phones on the website's pricelist, for example, include \u00a3105 for a functioning N95, \u00a348.10 for an 8800, \u00a34.10 for a 1110, a 1112 or a 1208, \u00a32.10 for a 3410 and nothing at all for a 5510 or a 9000.</p> <p>Non-functioning phones have some value, but are worth less than those in full working order - prices paid by processing websites are generally 30% to 50% lower.</p> <p>An alternative to profiting yourself from recycling an old handset is to pass on any value to a good cause. Many charities, both large and small, have teamed up with specialist processing organisations such as Greener Solutions (<a href=\"http://www.greenersolutions.co.uk\">greenersolutions.co.uk</a>) and the Recycling Appeal (<a href=\"http://recyclingappeal.com\">recyclingappeal.com</a>) to collect old mobiles for refurbishment or recycling. </p> <p>The amount charities receive for each handset depends on the individual arrangement they come to with the processing company and on how much of the promotional work they do themselves.</p> <p>The RSPB, for example, which works with the Recycling Appeal, receives varying amounts depending on the condition and age of each handset, working out at an average of \u00a35 per recyclable phone returned. Almost \u00a384,000 has been raised since the arrangement started in 2005.</p> <p>Guide Dogs for the Blind, which works with Greener Solutions, receives a flat rate \u00a33.50 per phone, regardless of its age or condition, and has brought in more than 258,000 phones, raising over \u00a3900,000 in the past seven years.</p> <p>Charities with a scheme in place will normally be able to send you a free envelope, and some charities offer a pick-up service if you collect a large enough quantity of phones. Many schools benefit from similar arrangements - check out Fones4Schools (<a href=\"http://fones4schools.co.uk\">fones4schools.co.uk</a>), for example.</p> <p>You can also hand in handsets for recycling at high street mobile phone shops.</p>",
  "<p>If you've ever had a demanding lover, you'll know what it's like to drive the new Volvo XC60. If it could talk, the XC60 would say, in a snooty voice: \"Not like that. Faster! Slower! Don't put your fingers there! Oh you're useless, let me do it!\" It's like Rowan Pelling, with a chunkier rear end, functioning airbags and GPS as standard.</p> <p>As I join the Valencia rush hour, lights are flashing and beeps beeping all over the car. I'm doing everything wrong. The driver-side wing mirror light tells me there is a car in my blind spot. A red light reflected on to the windscreen indicates the car thinks I'm too close to the vehicle ahead. The beeping has been activated because the car thinks I am poised to plunge over a Spanish precipice. </p> <p>I'm not up to driving this car. There's no handbrake! No ignition key! There is (this is insane) a remote control for the GPS that your smartarse kids in the back can use to countermand your programming. Then there's the adaptive cruise control which has been explained to me three times, but I still don't understand.</p> <p>This isn't Volvo's fault. I am an inadequate driver. The last time I owned a car was a year ago. My partner found herself in the street, daughter in one arm, shopping in the other, and a space where our motor should have been. \"It'll cost you \u00a3250 to get it back,\" said the not-unpleasant car pound functionary. The car was worth \u00a350, so we didn't bother. Now they're letting me drive a crossover 4x4 worth at least \u00a325,000. Fools!</p> <p>Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run comes unbidden over the stereo. The soundtrack is laughably inappropriate. While Asbury Park's highways are surely filled with broken heroes on a last-chance power drive, Valencia's boulevards today teem with thin-soled motoring correspondents test-driving the safest Volvo yet manufactured. We roll in brown and green hues to a nice lunch in the hills. Male car-junket veterans complain that Volvo's nannying motoring philosophy is anathema: they got into this game to treat the car as they dream of treating their women. They don't want to drive her sensibly to a tapas-based buffet according to Swedish safety parameters, but slap her around the hairpins. The XC60 won't stand for such nonsense. The Valencia air is thick with auto-sexual frustration.</p> <p>XC60's USP, the City Safety, is what Volvo's engineers yearn to tell us about. If you're nose-to-tailing it in heavy traffic at speeds of up to 30kph and you drift off into your thoughts (how nice it would be to have a Victoria sponge for tea), failing to brake before hitting the car ahead, the City Safety will brake for you. We test this facility in a playground. Egbert Bakker, the Dutchman in charge of Vehicle Dynamics, challenges me not to brake as I accelerate towards an inflatable simulacrum of a car. I accept. The car stops itself just short of collision. Per-Ola Fuxin, Volvo's City Safety expert, tells me this feature has been responsible for up to 30% insurance premium reductions in Germany and Sweden.</p> <p>Volvo, I learn, envisages an accident-free future in which cars will communicate with each other, rendering drivers all but redundant. The XC60, then, isn't so much a car as a stage on the highway to transhumanism. Ultimately, the main problem with the XC60 is me. This Volvo would do better if I vacated the driver's seat and allowed it to sort itself out. So I do. The feeling of relief, no doubt, is mutual.</p>",
  "<p><strong>My father</strong> was a famous broadcaster on Danish television. He insisted, when he wasn't travelling, that we sit together at the table and have conversations. He used to say, \"Before you go anywhere, darling, you must read the first three pages of the Times.\" </p> <p><strong>My children </strong>[she has three, aged 14, 18 and 20] call that time at the table \"trough and candle\". There have to be candles and quite often it looks as if we are eating from a massive trough. I can't recall eating a meal with them in front of the TV. Even when they were really small we used to go round the table and say, \"How was your day?\", even to the two-year-old sucking on a dummy. </p> <p><strong>We spent our childhood</strong> in Africa and Europe and the US. My father was a great believer that there was a much better education to be had on the road than in school. He was right, I think. But I wanted my kids to have what I didn't - a home town. I don't know where I came from. And because my kids were being brought up in unusual circumstances [they were conceived by donor insemination and are being brought up by Sandi and her former partner, Peta] I thought it best to give them as solid and secure a background as possible. Megan, who is 18, still lives in the house she was born in. Children like familiarity.</p> <p><strong>My sense of humour</strong> probably came from my mum. Many of the stories I grew up with were about the family crying with laughter while Mr Hitler did his best to bomb them to smithereens. They lived in Kent right under the Battle of Britain. But the stories were never about the horror of war but about my grandfather slipping down in the bunker. My mother is an astonishing woman. Like her, I want to go back to university when I retire. How marvellous to be able to study and this time not to be so drunk you can't pay attention. </p> <p><strong>I have a crooked view of the family</strong>. Peta, the other mum - the fact that we are not together any more doesn't mean we are not family - and the donor's other kids, they are all family, too. Peta lives nearby. We adore each other. My kids are close and she deserves a tremendous amount of credit for that. She always said, \"Your friends will let you down, your work colleagues will let you down, but your family will still be there.\"</p> <p><strong>The kids have taught me </strong>so much. Patience. Joy. Real love. I would sacrifice everything for them. When I came out 14 years ago everybody said, \"If you do this, your career will be over.\" I realised in that moment that it was more important to me that they didn't live their lives with any sense of shame than anything I do for a living. What a great decision. There was no option. That's love.</p> <p><strong>I'm not interested in success</strong>. I'm interested in contentment. I watch those dreadful people on The X Factor, with my children, talking about their dream. Are they insane? It's a career, not a dream. </p> <p><strong>Sabine Durrant</strong></p> <p><em>Girls are Best by Sandi Toksvig is published by Doubleday on November 6, \u00a37.99</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Snapshot: Fun and games at a village fete </strong></p> <p>On one of the hottest days of 1988, Folksworth had its village fete. By 2.30pm, under the sweltering sun, Women's Institute ladies were flogging prize-winning cakes, the bookstall was busy, pot plants wilted, and the bouncy castle shook and wobbled under small bodies. A loudspeaker announced the start of the games. We watched our son and others racing down the field with their wives in wheelbarrows, some wild and erratic egg throwing and a fancy dress parade where our granddaughter, aged three, picked up second prize as a ladybird. Mot the dog, parading the field with a pair of spectacles tied to his face, did not win a prize for the dog that looks most like its owner - but we did manage to score a bottle of orangeade on the tombola.</p> <p>So here we are, fete over. Dog has lost his glasses, Ladybird has shed her wings, husband and I are exhausted. The end of a perfect day. <strong>Jean Emsall</strong></p> <p><strong>Playlist: The painful perfection of Buddy</strong></p> <p><strong>True Love Ways by Buddy Holly</strong></p> <p>\"Just you know why/Why you and I/ Will by and by/Know true love ways\"</p> <p>When I first heard True Love Ways as a little girl, I ran and hid. </p> <p>My sister and I loved everything Dad played us. He took our musical education very seriously. We'd had healthy doses of the Everly Brothers, Ricky Nelson and lots of the Ronettes. He wanted us bouncing about to bubblegum pop. I boogied and bopped, my little sister twirled and fell over, and Dad saw his teaching pay off. The day he picked out Buddy Holly changed the way I felt about music. </p> <p>It was the tinkling opening to Buddy's ballad. The soft sweetness of his voice that made me squeal, change colour and hide behind the sofa. I cowered, all flushed, confused with delight, heart beating hard. It was too good. I begged him to take it off. </p> <p>Dad's records got more sophisticated. Gram Parsons, the Basement Tapes, Billie Holiday have all seen me through heartache and crisis. My sister and I still trill those Ronettes' choruses. </p> <p>But nothing since can do what Buddy did. And, although I am too big and too old to hide behind the sofa, I still turn pink with too much pleasure as Buddy begins. It's simple and pure and utterly perfect - and I still can't always get to the end. <strong>Anna Whitwham</strong></p> <p><strong>A letter to Max, my Old English sheepdog </strong></p> <p>Max, or shall I say Kergalee Rock'n'Roll Dancer (your kennel name), you were the pedigree pup my husband and I chose in 2001. You were small when I first met you, and I was warned about how big you would grow and how much looking after your fur would need. But I wanted you. I had always wanted you, before I even knew you. I had an impractical obsession with big breeds.</p> <p>You will never have the chance to read this letter, not because you prefer the Daily Mirror, but because you are merely a dog. But little did I know when I took you home (vomiting on my lap, even though the breeder said she hadn't fed you that morning to prevent motion sickness) how much your presence would mean to me.</p> <p>The first thing you did was teach me routine. When you woke me at 4am, \"crate training\", I was prepared. I had planned on you for almost all my life. But I had not planned to get pregnant. It happened only five months after we got you. None of us were prepared for it. But you were there, looking strangely at my expanding belly and giving me looks when I was watching the Discovery Health channel. You were whining and howling when the contractions started - but still calmer than my husband. You sniffed and lapped at the newborn. And, oh, how she has grown to love you. You have been so patient, taking your new place at the bottom of the family totem pole. Even if it means that your walks are shorter than they used to be.</p> <p>You will never understand how difficult it is for me to come home after collecting my toddler to find at 5.30pm on a Friday night that you have vomited on the carpet, or ripped apart the rubbish bin, or barked too loudly at the moaning neighbours. It's tiring. But I chose you; you didn't choose me. Every time I sit down in the house, you come to me. Your eyes first ask me if things are OK. I stroke your head, and then you tell me that things are OK. You're a member of this family and you always will be. You are not easy to live with - but nor are some of the other members. You will always be my crazy Old-English-Sheepdog-in-London puppy, Max. My oldest (and sometimes wisest) child. <strong>Alexa Thomas-Derrick</strong></p> <p><strong>We love to eat Mum's Guyanese metagee</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p>1 chopped onion</p> <p>1 small cassava root</p> <p>2 small eddoes (optional) </p> <p>1 medium-sized potato (the waxier the better)</p> <p>1 small sweet potato </p> <p>1 large carrot</p> <p>1 half-ripe plantain (yellow all over but without any brown spots)</p> <p>Handful of okra </p> <p>Small piece of yellow Scotch Bonnet pepper (the size of a 5p coin)</p> <p>Creamed coconut or tin of coconut milk</p> <p>Sprig of fresh thyme</p> <p>1 vegetarian stock cube</p> <p>Dumplings (see ingredients, right)</p> <p>There's nothing quite like the food you grow up with. Metagee is a one-pot stew of fish and root vegetables, eaten all over the Caribbean. My mother occasionally delighted us with this dish - never as often as we'd have liked but I suppose that was part of its persistent appeal. Her Guyanese version included smoked white fish in addition to the ingredients above. Its aroma makes me profoundly hungry - possibly for \"our home\" rather than for the calories. But what if, like me, you've become vegetarian? I can't claim that my fishless version is just as good, but it does seem to have the same effect on my wife - a vegetarian since her teens - as my mother's always had on me. </p> <p>Fry the onion in a little oil until soft. Peel and chop the vegetables into large chunks. Melt half a packet of creamed coconut in a pint of stock. (Or use a can of coconut milk and make up with stock.) Add the vegetables to the onion, layering them in the order given above. Add a teaspoon of salt, cover and cook over a low heat for five minutes. Then add a sprig of thyme and the coconut-based stock, adding extra stock if necessary to just cover the vegetables. Bring to the boil, then simmer until the vegetables are just tender. </p> <p>Meanwhile, make the dumplings. Mix 120g wholemeal flour, 60g white flour, 60g maize meal, 60g vegetarian suet, half tsp sugar, pinch of salt, 1 tsp baking powder and half tsp dried thyme. Add enough milk to make a moist dough. Divide into 10-12 pieces, roll into balls and add to the stew. Cover and steam until cooked. </p> <p>Note: There is a general law that there will never be quite enough dumplings, no matter how many you make. <strong>Omar Sattaur</strong></p>",

In Deauville, a taxi fare-removing run at the roulette wheel enforced a memorably tense, three-mile walk back to the hotel at 3am with my future wife. The honeymoon that so inexplicably ensued concluded with such a calamitous blackjack session in Atlantic City that I had to beg 50 cents off a bellboy to get us through the New Jersey Turnpike. You'll excuse me for not dwelling on the hurriedly aborted (premarital) pick-up of what proved to be a Eugene Terreblanche-worshipping transsexual in Sun City. Of myriad disasters, the moment that clings most immovably to the memory bank came when, on departing after a distressing evening of baccarat on the Edgware Road, I took a book of matches from reception. \"For what those free matches have cost you over the years,\" observed my fellow mug, \"you could own a house in Mayfair.\"</p> <p>And yet, for all this catalogue of self-inflicted despair, I've never known such unleavened casino gloom as at Manchester's 235 centre - and this without wagering a thrupenny bit. \"This is just... just...\" murmured my friend as we were seated in Linen, a vast but sparsely populated space a flight of stairs above the gaming floor. \"Why have you brought me here? What makes you wish to cause me pain?\"</p> <p>This chap being an actor, ordinarily I'd have dismissed this as queeny nonsense. But not in so wickedly an underlit room, done out to meld a sort of misguided Industrial Revolution retro chic with elements of Louis XV (the chairs) and a bemusing dash of Tardis (girders that light up, without warning, and move through the spectrum). \"I bet you a ton,\" he said, glancing up at the brickwork wallpaper covering the arched ceiling, \"that if you scraped it off, you'd find brickwork underneath. What look did they reject for this? What came in second?\" </p> <p>Why footballers and their womenfolk would wish to dine here, I've no idea, but if the presence of Cristal champagne and high-backed thrones in the salon priv\u00e9e behind us left a shred of doubt about the target clientele, the presence of \"traditional prawn cocktail\" removed it. What the chef removed, meanwhile, was the traditional texture and taste of frozen prawns, so that in a blind tasting you'd have lumped the mortgage on tofu. The sauce Marie Rose was, weirdly, really rather good, but my friend's oak-smoked Goosnargh duck breast was not. </p> <p>\"I'd assumed they meant 30% off the bill, not the portions,\" my friend remarked of the Tuesday night promotion (150%, and it might have a chance) on receiving a plate of five razor- thin slices of charmless meat. \"This is the Kate Moss of duck breast.\"</p> <p>By the time the main courses arrived, the room was emptier and more sepulchral than ever, and the opening to market Linen as the venue for meetings of Exit's paramilitary wing so much wider that one could sympathise with the chef's abandonment of any ambition to maintain the stolid competence loosely hinted at by the starters. My seared loin of venison was a triumph of culinary alchemy. I cannot say precisely how this most regal of meats had been imbued with the flavour of the raw tuna it resembled in appearance, despite being requested medium rare, but since it was stone cold, the microwave can be acquitted. My friend's \"whole stuffed sea bass\" seemed to be two cunningly thawed fillets of farmed fish clamped around a hideous pesto stuffing. \"Have you seen Alien lately?\" he inquired on opening it, gingerly taking a bite. \"This is tragic. I feel sorry for the fish.\"</p> <p>A side dish of sugar snaps came, curiously, with uncooked cashews, while another of honey-roasted root vegetables had avoided the traditional lure of caramelisation to raise the hunting cry, \"Pneumatic drill to table 19.\" As for puddings, the question mark at the end of \"Probably the best chocolate cake in the world?\" may have been inserted on legal advice, because it probably wouldn't qualify as the best in Asda. As for \"medley of summer fruits\", apart from advising against serving refrigerated items on boiling hot plates, all that need be said is check the calendar and see if you can spot the logistical flaw.</p> <p>We chatted for a while with our enchanting Roman waitress and took our leave, stopping at the tables on the way out as a matter of courtesy, but the sadomasochistic craving for despair was already so sated that we lacked the appetite to lose more than a few quid.

  "<p>As recession bites hard, a more despondent, down-at heel group of people than the debtors at the bankruptcy courts in the Strand would be hard to find. Waiting for their papers were mothers with fractious children, weary old men, an Italian singer, a lorry driver, a decorator, a former City trader, and scores more, all with their stories to tell. </p> <p>Then astonishingly there was Micky waving at me, still with the studs in his nose and eyebrows, an unexpected old friend. He was in the next-door flat when I lived briefly on the Clapham Park Estate, a man I wrote about in my book Hard Work. Once he was a social worker, but when I met him he'd been out of work for six years following a nervous breakdown. So what brought him here today? He smiled, and shrugged. The same as just about everyone else in that waiting room - credit card debts. </p> <p>He owed \u00a320,000. How on earth did that happen? There was an overdraft and then some cards, until a company offered to sweep all his debts into one - at an even worse interest rate. The most he'd earned was \u00a312,000 a year, and that was a while back, but he was offered all these cards. Recently he called Provident, the lender of absolutely last resort, looking for a loan just to hold off the threatening letters. Yes indeed, they said - but at 184% APR. That's when he finally gave in and went for bankruptcy. \"I got another card through my door this very morning saying I'd been 'pre-selected as suitable for a loan' from yet another company. I couldn't believe it. They're still at it. Nothing's changed.\" </p> <p>Others round the room joined in, exchanging stories of the same debt collecting companies. \"I haven't opened my front door in months,\" said the Italian singer who owed \u00a346,000, juggled between five credit cards. The lorry driver had shuttled debts between cards for eight years, full of shame, until rolled-over interest swelled to \u00a365,000; he was paying off \u00a31,500 a month, more than the \u00a3300 a week he earned. A care-worn mother with a toddler and a baby was too depressed to speak; her brother said she'd been going through a bad time when she accumulated the \u00a310,000 debt, and it just grew. \"God knows how they let her borrow all this!\"</p> <p>Few waiting for bankruptcy papers that day had any assets, property, cars; some had lost their jobs. In most cases there was nothing to repossess, though one woman sectioned under the Mental Health Act risked losing her home in Bow, but the registrar delayed it. If ever there was sub-prime debt, here it was. They might have been devil-may-care good-time spenders, but most had struggled frantically to keep up payments, until debt advisers told them to file for bankruptcy. </p> <p>Registrars and officers in bankruptcy courts express despairing astonishment at how debt was allowed to bubble out of control in recent years and \"on-the-never-never\" entered the nation's bloodstream. The Enterprise Act that came into force in 2004 toughened anti-cartel legislation, but also sought to \"modernise insolvency law\" - a symptom of how Labour fell under the spell of City magicians who said deregulation would let the boom rip. Debt and bankruptcy must not hurt risk-taking, they said. Start-ups must be allowed to fail painlessly, so entrepreneurs can pick themselves up and try again. The act discharged bankrupts after a year instead of three. Debts soared, bankruptcies more than doubled and kept rising. </p> <p>British law is now so lax there is even bankruptcy tourism, especially from prudent Germany where it takes six years to be discharged. A German car dealer with large debts back home was waiting in court that day: he only had to establish a token business here and British law would wipe out his German debts in a year's time. </p> <p>One wise judge said there was now no reason why the penniless with nothing to lose shouldn't seize every opportunity the credit industry offered to borrow until they bust - then do it all over again. The banks spread the cost invisibly among the rest of their customers in a secret redistribution. It had suited everyone, fuelling high street spending. Luckily for reckless capitalism, the poor are willing to work hard in essential jobs that don't pay a living wage, so they need to borrow: they are mostly honest and easily shamed by debt collectors. That's why banks go on lending to them, as most move heaven and earth to repay. </p> <p>But while some drown in credit, a credit drought is killing off others. As the real economy shrinks for the first time in 16 years and shares again plunge alarmingly, ministers promise small businesses protection from going bust due to banks refusing loans. Will it happen? The British Bankers' Association retorted this week that the onus is not on banks to keep businesses afloat. \"It seems inevitable some businesses will not survive,\" it said. Already some 280 small businesses are folding every week. Yesterday I was contacted by Powertech, a thriving solar boiler company that has just landed a string of orders worth \u00a33m, including a contract with Aga/Rayburn to fit all new ranges - the fruition of 10 years of development. With new orders from Canada and the US, it needs to hire staff and pay for containers from China. Yet its bankers of many years are refusing more than a \u00a320,000 overdraft. Without credit they can't fulfil orders, and would be bought out. </p> <p>We the people own so much of the banking system yet still allow banks to use state funds to fatten up their capital assets, instead of giving good credit where it's desperately needed. How is it that bad credit at toxic rates still isn't firmly controlled? A government that this week had nothing to say about Lloyds TSB paying out bonuses from taxpayers' money seems equally incapable of asserting its authority to make banks lend. After being rescued from certain catastrophe, bankers are as full of hubris as ever; and the government is as eager as ever not to interfere, but to sell off its holdings as fast as it can. </p> <p>Spam in my inbox yesterday from Churchwood Finance offered: \"Refused a loan? Judgements, defaults and blacklisted? No problem! Loans from \u00a3500 to \u00a3250,000.\" Meanwhile, here's a small test of Labour's willingness to use its new bank ownership well: will the government see that one of the people's banks lends money to Powertech, part of the green future?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill is to investigate claims that John Carew was in a lap-dancing bar on the morning of Aston Villa's Uefa Cup tie against Ajax on Thursday. It is alleged the Norway international was in the nightclub until the early hours and, if so, is guilty of breaking Villa's pre-match curfew. If the allegations are proved he is likely to be fined two weeks' wages, which equates to about \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>Although O'Neill omitted Carew from the squad that faced Ajax, the Villa manager was not aware of the allegations that he had visited The Rocket Club in Birmingham's Broad Street and was instead responding to the forward's claims earlier in the week that he was suffering from fatigue since returning from international duty. Carew, however, did not learn that he would be rested for the Ajax match, which Villa won 2-1, until the day of the game, meaning that he breached club rules by going out in the city.</p> <p>Although there is no suggestion that the 29-year-old consumed alcohol in the nightclub, O'Neill is unlikely to take a lenient view. He knew nothing of the allegations until yesterday morning but has vowed to take the matter further, with Carew expected to be given the maximum fine and warned as to his future conduct if found guilty.</p> <p>O'Neill had initially indicated Carew would be in contention for tomorrow's match at Wigan Athletic after the blood tests the club had run earlier in the week showed there was nothing untoward, despite the player's concerns that he was feeling tired. However, in the wake of the claims of late-night partying, there remains a strong possibility O'Neill will now jettison him from the squad that travels to the JJB Stadium.</p> <p>Carew, who has been a key figure in Villa's renaissance since he arrived from Lyon last year, has a reputation for enjoying a nocturnal lifestyle at times and having a relaxed approach to training. \"He takes himself off to an outside-left position and stays there, offering no help to anyone,\" joked O'Neill this month.</p> <p>Carew was not available for comment last night and his agent, Per Flod, insisted he had nothing to say in public about the matter.</p> <p>The controversial plan to play top-flight English league matches overseas could still come to fruition, the Premier League chief executive,<strong> Richard Scudamore</strong>, said last night. </p> <p>The so-called\"39th game\" plan, which has drawn criticism from Fifa president Sepp Blatter, was revealed last year with Scudamore calling for an extra round of league fixtures to be played around the globe in cities such as Beijing. He compared the plan to the NFL's decision to stage a regular season game between the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers at Wembley Stadium tomorrow. </p> <p>\"Globalisation of sport is here and this is just the next manifestation of it,\" said Scudamore at a global sports summit.</p> <p>\"We knew the reaction would be somewhat extreme and we knew it was going to be difficult, maybe not quite as difficult, but clearly we have been looking at this for some time.</p> <p>\"It would be ridiculous of me to say the reaction hasn't moved us back to, if not to the drawing board, then certainly the think tank. It has probably pushed the time-lines back.</p> <p>\"But in terms of playing meaningful games abroad, hopefully it will happen within my lifetime, hopefully within my soccer administration career.\"</p> <p>Chelsea's chief executive, Peter Kenyon, said clubs had a duty to support the Premier League in trying to grow its global appeal, although he said the concept of a 39th game still had to be properly worked out. </p> <p>\"The idea of the 39th game got out of the box without a proper rationale or way that it would work,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Sent to investigate the drifting hulk of the USG Ishimura, your shuttle crashes separating you from your companions and leaving you alone in a spaceship full of aliens bent on killing and eating you. At this point, rather than arm you to the teeth, Dead Space gives you stasis (which freezes enemies) and kinesis (that lets you pick things up) and very little ammunition. The result is a stressful game, but one that actually isn't all that much fun to play - it sacrifices spooky atmosphere for relentless action and the usual run-and-gun antics for repeated hammering of shrieking mutants with your bare hands.

  "<p>It started as <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C09%5C27%5Cstory_27-9-2008_pg13_8\">a dispute</a> over administrative control -\u2013 Hindus and Christians living in Lahore's Anarkali district fighting over full rights to a temple both religious groups share.<br> But the Balmiki Hindu temple dispute has rolled on, into something larger. It has become personal, pitching the two religions against each other where once there was relative calm. The Hindus say the Christians have used the temple as a meeting house and prostitution den. The Christians claim they do not want \"outside occupiers\" involved in internal temple affairs. The department for minority affairs is now <a href=\"www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C09%5C30%5Cstory_30-9-2008_pg13_8\">trying to find a resolution</a>.<br> It got me thinking: in a country which is 94% Muslim, why should there be so much friction between minority religions? Surely knowing your community exists on the fringes of a much wider group in a religious republic would promote understanding and foster tolerance? </p> <p>Of the two minorities, it's fair to say that Christians, though persecuted, have made more strides than Hindus in gaining mainstream acceptance in Pakistan. This may be due to their monotheism and the fact that Hinduism is closely associated with India \u2013 particularly in the Punjab where the Hindu population is tiny. </p> <p>Any Christian leanings I've displayed to Muslims here have always been received positively and Muslims I've spoken with often point positively to similarities between Islam and Christianity: one deity, one text, group worship. In Lahore there seems to be more suspicion of Hindus, perhaps because of perceptions that Hinduism involves \"idolatry\", perhaps because tension along the Indian border and events in disputed Kashmir seem very close here. </p> <p>Some friction must be expected, but now more than ever a tolerant approach is needed. Political crises tend to go hand in hand with heightened unrest among minority communities. <br> One local reporter I spoke to said that with talks between India and Pakistan at a sensitive stage, the resolution of the Balmiki dispute, should it be seen to favour the Christian sect, may have a negative impact across the border.  In this respect the importance for the Christians involved in the dispute (themselves recent converts from Hinduism) to cede ground goes beyond solving this particular issue.  After the Babri mosque at Ayodhya <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1843879.stm\">was destroyed</a> several years ago in India protesters partly damaged the Balmiki temple and similar sites in retaliation.</p> <p>Religion does not solely appear be behind this current upset, though. Greed seems to have been at the heart of similar past disputes, over access to land and buildings and the monetary gains that come from such control.</p> <p>One example is a Muslim-Christian dispute near Lahore a few years ago in which Muslims were accused of <a href=\"http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C02%5C04%5Cstory_4-2-2006_pg7_16\">defacing a church</a>. It was found to be nothing more than an attempt to resolve an argument between a Christian pastor and a Muslim land-owner.</p> <p>This temple dispute, too, seems more about land control but it has thrown minority religion into the spotlight and encouraged mudslinging. The Balmiki temple has been shared by Hindus and Balmiki Christians who converted 30 years ago.</p> <p>The impact of growing friction between minorities is worrisome, given the rise in attacks and threats by groups in the name of Islam which has created a religious instability and debate to which it would be unwise to add, especially by a minority group. </p> <p>It is difficult to believe all groups pertaining to Taliban links or who issue threats in the name of Islam are acting on religious principles. </p> <p>It feels more like efforts to gain land, or force the closure of rival shops, say; a chance to revenge personal grievance or ensure personal gain under the banner of religious belief.</p> <p>Calls for the implementation of shariah law among tribal factions can smack less of religious fervour and more of trying to grab on to something to protect the way of life in Pakistan's tribal belt, with less input from Islamabad. </p> <p>Using religion to win a more tangible dispute can ultimately only cast it in a poor light and encourage mounting intolerance and misunderstanding</p> <p>Adding further disputes between religions to Pakistan's fragile political and religious climate, especially from minorities, could accelerate tension in a country which has witnessed past instability stemming from religious dispute, and who is seen globally, however inaccurately, as a breeding ground for religious radicalism.</p>",
  "<p>High in the rugged peaks of southeastern Turkey, a 70-year-old Kurdish shepherd almost choked when he heard I was American.</p> <p>\"Why are you helping the Turks kill our boys?\" he cried out. \"Kurds are innocent people, peaceful people, good people. Whatever else you hear about us is a lie. They think they can finish us, but that is impossible.\"</p> <p>The long-festering Kurdish conflict, which in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/11/turkey-kurds\">recent weeks</a> has produced the death of 17 Turkish soldiers and a retaliation raid against insurgent bases in northern Iraq, is Turkey's bleeding wound. More than 30,000 people have been killed since the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7044760.stm\">PKK</a> launched its rebellion in the mid-1980s. The government, by its own account, has spent hundreds of billions of dollars to repress it.</p> <p>As long as this war rages, Turkey, despite all its impressive social, political and economic progress - recognised last week by its <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/17/news/UN-UN-Security-Council.php\">election to the UN security council</a> - will not reach the greatness that is within its grasp. Peace, on the other hand, would allow it to prosper as never before and take its place alongside Russia, Brazil and India as one of the world's great regional powers. Yet although the long military campaign against Kurdish nationalism has by every measure been an utter failure, the state continues to pursue it.</p> <p>The reason is evident: Turkish generals cannot break away from their paralysing fear that recognising Kurdish identity will set off a separatist wave that would ultimately tear Turkey apart. They refuse see Turkey as the multicultural mosaic that it is. Until they do, or until civilians manage to wrest control over Kurdish policy from them, this war will continue.</p> <p>I recently spent 10 days travelling through the southeastern provinces that are the ancestral homeland of Turkey's Kurds. Hardly an hour passed without someone giving me the same refrain. A mayor, a barber, a law student, a businesswoman, a historian - each told me that this conflict will end when Turkey gives Kurds the right to their language and their culture.</p> <p>Never did anyone tell me that Kurds should break away from Turkey and form a nation of their own, or join with their Kurdish cousins in northern Iraq. What they want, I heard time and again, is the right to live as Kurds, electing their own regional leaders and shaping their own fate within the framework of a more tolerant Turkish Republic.</p> <p>Many Kurds in Turkey are grateful to the US for its role in helping to create the Kurdish statelet in neighbouring Iraq. They are angry, though, over US military support for Turkey. This support is not specifically designed to help the Turkish army fight Kurdish rebels, but since Turkey is a Nato ally, its forces in the southeast enjoy the benefits of western training, equipment and intelligence.</p> <p>Part of what makes this conflict so tragic is that every rational analyst knows how it will end. The solution will have three simple parts: the PKK will give up its weapons and pledge to pursue its goals by political means only; a general amnesty will be given to fighters on both sides; and Kurds will be granted cultural rights and a measure of political self-determination. What no one knows is whether the state will accept this solution next year, in 10 years, or in half a century.</p> <p>Public pressure on Turkey to make this deal sooner rather than later would provoke angry nationalist reaction. The US, however, could use its extensive contacts in the Turkish military to nudge its commanders away from the self-destructive policy they have followed for the last two decades. American leaders should insist that the Kurdish conflict cannot be resolved by military force, because at its core, it is a conflict over identity.</p> <p>Today, however, any general in the world would probably break out in laughter upon hearing an American leader say that compromise and patient negotiation is a better way to resolve conflicts than military force. For the last six years, the US has been acting on precisely the opposite principle. Americans cannot credibly urge restraint on others while pursuing their bomb-and-occupy policy in Iraq and Afghanistan. This leaves the Kurdish challenge where it should be left: to the Turks themselves.</p> <p>\"The main problem is the concept of the Turkish state,\" Dagestan Toprak, a businessman and former deputy mayor of Diyarbakir, told me one morning. \"It needs to be democratised. Even if all Kurds were to disappear overnight, this would still be an absolute necessity.\"</p> <p>The founder of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Ataturk, left his people a magnificent motto: \"Peace at home, peace in the world.\" These days, Turkey is pursuing the second half of that imperative as resolutely as any nation on earth. It has brokered factional talks in Pakistan, brought Israel and Syria together and urged the US and Iran to resolve their dispute through negotiation. All it needs to do now is take the same approach at home.</p>",
  "<p>As the British media <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/24/mandelson-labour\">takes a closer look</a> at the intertwined interests of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, Lord Mandelson, and shadow chancellor George Osborne, we Americans can claim a bit part in the saga.</p> <p>The Nation <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20081020/ames_berman \">reported earlier this month</a> on Deripaska's encounters with John McCain and his campaign manager, Rick Davis. The most colourful scene from their dispatch takes place in August 2006, when McCain celebrated his 70th birthday on a luxury yacht moored in Montenegro. Sitting in the same bay was the Queen K, Deripaska's even posher yacht, where <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/21/conservatives-partyfunding\">Osborne and Mandelson lived it up</a> in August.</p> <p>McCain aides said no one could remember Deripaska attending McCain's yacht party, although the two men had crossed paths at a dinner for international guests celebrating Montenegrin independence, which the Republican presidential nominee had long supported. Deripaska was also a promoter of Montenegrin sovereignty, albeit mostly <a href=\"http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/7107/\">for business reasons</a>. </p> <p>(Raffaello Follieri was certainly <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2080292/posts\">a fellow reveller of McCain's</a>, although his 15 minutes of fame may have finally ended today with his <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2008/10/anne-hathaways.html\">sentencing to 54 months</a> in prison.)</p> <p>No evidence has emerged thus far to suggest that McCain helped further Deripaska's political or financial ends, other than a veiled hint from Davis - cited by The Nation - about a joint business venture in a \"metals company\" that he represented. </p> <p>But one conservative watchdog group in the US went after McCain half a year ago for facilitating a fundraiser <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/29/johnmccain.uselections2008\">at the home of Nat Rothschild</a>, the Deripaska associate at the centre of the Osborne-Mandelson row. Foreign donations, even \"in-kind\" contributions such as assistance raising money, are prohibited under American election law.</p> <p>So if the Osborne-Mandelson-Deripaska drama were to be made into a movie, McCain would undeniably have a walk-on role.

  "<p>We are at the end of an era that began with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_(financial_markets)\">Big Bang</a> exactly 22 years ago on Monday, October 27. The deregulation of finance in Britain set in train two decades of profiteering to the point of destruction. For the moment things are quiet, but hard times lie ahead. The Conservatives created this era. The New Labour project embraced it. Infatuated with the world of money and power, it traded its morality for a nihilistic culture of capitalism and a naive faith in the American business model. Market choice was its shibboleth. Now it is crashing to earth and with it tumbles the ideology of New Labour.</p> <p>But it still has life left in it. On Monday the anniversary of the Big Bang will be marked by the introduction of New Labour's welfare reform. The new Employment and Support Allowance will replace Incapacity Benefit. Claimants will have to attend work-focused interviews and draw up an action plan for a return to employment. Failure to participate will result in cuts in benefits. The Personal Capability Assessment, already a stringent test which decides who can and cannot receive benefit, will be replaced by the Work Capability Assessment. It will be much harder to pass. Those suffering mental illness already have to endure an insensitive system. They will now have an even tougher time achieving the necessary number of score points.</p> <p>Last Wednesday concluded the consultation period for James Purnell's next phase of welfare reform \u2013 the green paper, <a href=\"www.dwp.gov.uk/welfarereform/noonewrittenoff\">No One Written Off</a>. Purnell, the minister for work and pensions, is ambitious. There are 2.6 million people on incapacity benefit. He wants one million of them and another 300,000 single parents back into work. He is wasting no time and is pressing ahead with the white paper. But his welfare reform is not viable.</p> <p>There are currently only 608,000 job vacancies in the economy and unemployment is rising. The Jobseeker's Allowance count <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm081020/ debtext/81020-0001.htm#column_1\">rose last month</a> to 939,900. By Christmas it <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/unemploymentdata-economics\">could be two million</a>. What's more, the business model of welfare reform set out in the <a href=\"www.dwp.gov.uk/publications/dwp/2007/welfarereview.pdf\">Freud Report</a> has been completely discredited by the collapse of the banks. It is based on the belief that the private sector is the only body capable of running the welfare system: only the private sector can shoulder the financial risks; only the private sector will bring in the banks, which will be able to fund the \"extremely large investments implied here\". It was wrong before the credit crunch, but now few need convincing of the fact. Despite this, its author, the banker <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/1577312/1.9m-on-benefit-%20'should-go-back-to-work'.html\">David Freud</a>, is employed by the DWP to oversee its implementation.</p> <p>Purnell's welfare reform proposal with its threat of workfare \u2013 effectively forced labour \u2013 threatens a welfare crunch. The DWP's own research shows that punitive style workfare isn't an effective way of <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd5/rrs-index.asp\">reducing unemployment</a>. It creates a revolving door of claimants who are forced into inappropriate jobs without adequate support. They drop out and end up back on welfare, or eventually fall into destitution. If the proposals in the green paper become law they will mark the destruction of the principle that those in need should be helped by the wider community.</p> <p>But growing numbers of people are now being confronted by the threat of redundancy. They are discovering that the collective good of social insurance is in dangerously short supply. Public disquiet at New Labour's welfare reform is growing. The Public and Commercial Services Union has taken the lead and has launched a campaign to stop Purnell's reforms. Welfare reform is not just about politics, it is about our collective morality and the kind of society we want to live in. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS, said his opposition to the green paper's proposals are simple: they lack humanity. He does not want his children to grow up and face such a punitive system. What kind of society do we want after the era of perfidy?</p> <p><em>After New Labour, the second debate in the Who owns the progressive future series, organised by Comment is free and Soundings magazine, will be held in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<p>So it's over. What started with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/07/uselections2008\">bluegrass</a> ended with Falstaff. </p> <p>There have been no more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">raccoons</a> (although I did see a whole family of five scuttling across Jefferson last week). </p> <p>And while I confess I am still baffled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/uselections2008\">squeamishness</a> of some locals over being associated with bluegrass (I have yet to hear mention of another kind of music that could be associated with the area), I understand much more now why so many are proud of Roanoke and were sensitive to the possibility that it would be maligned or caricatured on the international stage.</p> <p>Friendly, vibrant, engaging, complex, diverse (economically more than ethnically) are just a few descriptions that spring to mind. </p> <p>The photo gallery that accompanies this piece hopefully gives a flavour of the city in all its glory and gory daily life. </p> <p>I also stand by my original description of Roanoke as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">eccentric</a>. One evening I discussed pillaging with a man dressed as a Viking. His beard was plaited and he had an Obama sticker on his helmet. He said the woman with him was not his girlfriend, she just made his mead. </p> <p>It's not that people didn't notice, but the fact he was dressed as a Viking didn't seem to come up in any conversation. When I brought it up it was like I was the strange one. </p> <p>It was just one evening; and he was just one Viking. But along with the Obama supporter who wouldn't hear a bad word said about the confederate general Robert E Lee, the drama over the mouse infestation in the city market (did the mayor <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/178852\">really compare it to 9/11</a>?) and the lady with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/23/barack-obama-art-roanoke-virginia\">monkey and the hats</a> at NoShame Theatre, I don't think \"eccentric\" is a push. Particularly after the Nader voter who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama1\">brandished a gun</a> in my direction.</p> <p>On one of my last nights in town I bumped into Chris Walters, last seen at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/03/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Republican vice-presidential debate watching party</a> a few weeks back. </p> <p>We were at the urinals in Fork in the Alley and Chris thought this would be an ideal time to impugn my journalism. </p> <p>He said I misquoted him as saying: \"I didn't dislike John McCain. But he is an independent thinker and I'm a conservative.\" I checked. I didn't. He then told me I had come \"with an agenda\". I reminded him that I was one of the few people who had suggested that \"Palin had edged it\". Chris said if that was true he would apologise. I'm still waiting. I guess being a Republican means never having to say you're sorry.</p> <p>But he was right on one thing. I did come with an agenda. To find out how this election was playing out in Roanoke, on issues both big and small. </p> <p>There were some stories I wish I'd had the time to pursue. I wanted to do one on gay life in the town, which seems to be a hub for gay folk from many miles around. I also wanted to write about the large number of mixed-race couples I seemed to spot everywhere. A few had spoken to me about issues with their extended families (some of them political) that I thought were intriguing. </p> <p>Most criminally I did not cover the war. I did make some calls, which lead to nothing. But since it kept not coming up I decided not to force it. Then at the Obama rally his biggest cheer was when he promised to stop the war. And I thought - it's in there somewhere, I wish I'd spent more time on it.</p> <p>Finally I wish I'd been able to get a better sense of what the Republicans were up to. I tried. God knows I tried. But while those on the Obama campaign <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">were extremely friendly and open</a>, the Republicans were ... well, more elusive. </p> <p>I sent two emails to the local Republican functionary, Mr Reedy, telling him \"I'm very keen to cover some Republican activities in the area and was wondering if you could point me in the right direction. </p> <p>\"We spent a morning, with a cameraman, at the Democratic party offices yesterday morning, spoke to some of their volunteers and went out canvassing with them. I was wondering if there was anything similar we could do with the Republican volunteers. </p> <p>\"We are committed, whenever possible, to present local politics in its entirety in a fair and balanced manner.\" </p> <p>I thought the fair and balanced thing might reel him in. No dice.</p> <p>I went by the office but he told me not to come in as no one would be able to speak to me without prior approval from on high. </p> <p>I blame this on the organisation. Most Republicans I did actually meet outside the campaign and away from the urinals were quite pleasant. </p> <p>Sarah Palin is coming to the next-door town of Salem on Monday. I wish I could be here to see it</p> <p>So with all those omissions what did I find out? That the Obama campaign seems better organized, better funded and in better spirits. That both parties have problems with their bases - Republicans with evangelicals and Democrats with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-barackobama1\">African Americans</a>. </p> <p>But while the Democratic problem is purely organisational, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/john-mccain-virginia-roanoke-campaign\">Republican problem</a> is more profoundly political. If the Republicans are fighting hard here, then they are fighting hard almost everywhere. And that means they are in serious trouble.</p> <p>I came because I thought it would be interesting. It was. But I didn't count on it actually being fun. So thank you, Roanoke. And goodbye.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Contact Gary Younge at <a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The current global financial crisis has clearly underlined the need for more effective mechanisms of international cooperation. The stumbling initial response of the G7 risked prolonging the credit crunch. Today, while panic has eased somewhat in wealthy countries, the crisis is spilling into developing countries, with potentially devastating effects. Yet there is no coordinated effort to address the problems faced by emerging markets.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/globaleconomy-g8\">Jeffrey Sachs argues</a>, a Bretton Woods II may be necessary to build a new global financial and economic system. In fact, the multilateral, cooperative spirit of Bretton Woods is urgently needed today. If the crisis only deepens the divide between haves and have-nots, it is difficult to see how an international summit could be successful. And at the top of today's agenda must be saving the <a href=\"http://24carat.co.uk/eurozoneframe.html\">eurozone</a>.</p> <p>Last week's coordinated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/16/ubs-creditsuisse\">bank recapitalisations</a> helped calm the panic in the wealthiest European countries, but there are signs that the problem has been stamped out in one place only to resurface in another. Most ominously, expectations are rising that some European governments will default on their debts. During the last three months, the implied risk that Ireland, Italy and Greece will default within five years \u2013 based on credit default swap spreads for their sovereign debt \u2013 has quadrupled from approximately 3% to 12% each. </p> <p>So far, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap\">credit default swaps</a> (CDSs) have correctly predicted the spread of risk from mortgage-backed securities, to consumer lenders and investment banks, then to commercial banks. Now they are pointing to some of the wealthiest sovereign nations. </p> <p>This is only logical. In many European nations, banks have amassed more debt than taxpayers can afford to repay. These liabilities need to be refinanced periodically, but the current crisis has made that more difficult. In addition, bank debt was largely used to buy assets based on real property that is falling in value. In a severe recession, that decline could render much of the European financial sector insolvent.</p> <p>This is all old news. However, by guaranteeing their systematically important financial institutions, European governments assumed that risk themselves. For example, the Irish announced they would guarantee all liabilities of their major banks \u2013 over 3 times current GDP and over 12 times government revenues. ING's assets equal 2.9 times Holland's GDP at \u20ac1.3tn; the recent recapitalisation provides \u20ac10bn of new capital, or just 0.8% of total assets. If asset values fall sharply, much more capital will be required. Can these countries afford to support all of their core financial institutions? This is the question markets are starting to focus on. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/asia.htm\">1997-98 emerging markets crisis</a> showed how such conditions can lead to collapse. A country finds that its creditors are increasingly reluctant to hold its bonds due to perceived risk. Interest rates on that nation's debt rise, making the debt harder to pay off. To win back confidence, the country needs to tighten fiscal policy, but this can be politically difficult. Fear grows that, instead, the country will inflate its debt away or default outright; rates rise further. The prophecy is ultimately self-fulfilling: fear of a collapse leads to collapse.</p> <p>The standard policy prescription is to tighten fiscal policy and let the exchange rate depreciate sharply. This raises exports, reduces imports and improves national savings. </p> <p>The problem, however, is that eurozone nations no longer have control over their monetary policy, the European Central Bank (ECB) does, and its mandate is to maintain a 2% inflation target. Troubled countries, including Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Portugal, will prefer loose monetary policies, but are sure to be opposed by the Germans (and French) who insist on the low inflation target. Threatened countries will be forced to tighten their belts using fiscal policy and brace for a deep recession. This will be politically painful. </p> <p>If there is a sufficiently deep, global recession, the eurozone may not survive. Countries threatened by default will question the merits of the euro; they will suffer high interest rates, negating one of its expected benefits, and will see other nations as benefiting at their expense. Nationalist politicians will argue that they are better off setting policy at home, echoing Iceland's cry: \"every country for itself.\" The costs of abandoning the euro would be very high, but it could happen, given domestic political instability and intransigence within the eurozone. If one nation breaks away, investors will wonder who is next, cutting off financing from other countries. Contracts in euros will need to be abrogated, causing untold dislocation. The damage will be enormous. <br> However, there is a good chance this scenario can be avoided, if some difficult decisions are taken now before markets demand them through higher interest rates. At the least, failure to act now will require more expensive measures to be taken deeper into the crisis. </p> <p>First, policy makers must generate confidence that they understand and are dealing with these dangers. The ECB's insistence on high interest rates has damaged its credibility. Recent joint efforts by governments, along with the 0.5 percentage point interest rate cut, are steps in the right direction. </p> <p>Second, there need to be mechanisms to ensure that investors who bet against national solvency will lose money. To date, those investors are doing extremely well. We need to discourage such bets and cut the potentially self-fulfilling cycles of higher interest rates that lead to insolvency. </p> <p>We recommend the following steps for the eurozone: </p> <p>1. Lower the ECB base rate now to 2% from the current 3.75%. The coming global recession will dramatically reduce inflation pressures, and a rate cut is needed to offset the recession. Lower rates will help recapitalize banks by making their lending more profitable, and will allow them to charge less to mortgage holders. The 2% inflation target should not be abandoned but should be subordinated to the need for financial stability (without which there will likely be deflation down the road).</p> <p>2. Create a European Stability Fund with at least \u20ac2tn of credit lines guaranteed by all Eurozone member nations and potentially other European countries with large financial systems such as Switzerland, Sweden and the UK. This fund should provide alternative financing to member countries in case market rates on their government debt become too high. This will prevent a self-fulfilling cycle of rising interest rates. The fund should be large enough to have credibility; countries could access the fund automatically, but should then adopt a 5-year program for ensuring financial stability, subject to peer review within the Eurozone.</p> <p>3. All eurozone nations should launch temporary fiscal expansions of at least 1% of GDP. These plans should be aimed at reducing the severity of the upcoming recession and assisting people at risk of default on mortgages or other financial instruments, thereby helping people in trouble and reducing default rates in the financial sector. </p> <p>4. The EU and Switzerland should develop a financial regulatory framework that recognises that systemically important institutions may need to be bailed out by Europe as a whole. One goal should be to reduce extreme differences in national financial risk and leverage so that these problems are less likely to reoccur. </p> <p>These measures will not resolve all of Europe's problems. The coming recession is likely to be severe, and its impact will vary greatly across the eurozone. Some domestic politicians will argue against having one currency for such a diverse area. However, it would be far more costly to abandon the euro now than to keep it. Ultimately, to make good on last week's promise to support all core financial institutions, the eurozone must also promise to support all of its member nations. Otherwise the eurozone may become fragmented and the benefits of the euro will be lost.<br><em><br>This article was written by Simon Johnson, Peter Boone and James Kwak.</em></p> <p><em>Peter Boone is chairman of Effective Intervention, a UK-based charity, and a research associate at the Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics. </em></p> <p><em>Simon Johnson is a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. </em></p> <p><em>James Kwak is a student at Yale Law School.

  "<p><strong>Being Juan Malkovich</strong></p> <p>There are multiple John Malkovichs in the multiplex this autumn: he plays an ousted CIA man in Burn After Reading, appears in Clint Eastwood's Changeling and has a cameo in The Mutant Chronicles. This week, it was announced that the busy actor is also returning to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">theatre</a>, and will direct a play in Mexico City. The Good Canary, which opens next month, follows an author whose career is derailed as his wife succumbs to drug addiction. The play, written by the American Zach Helm, will be performed in Spanish. Diego Luna will play the lead role at the Insurgentes theatre. Last year, Malkovich directed a French-language production of Helm's play in Paris, and won the best director gong at the Moli\u00e8re awards. </p> <p><strong>Corr blimey!</strong></p> <p>Singer Andrea Corr, who shot to fame with her siblings in the Corrs, will make her West End stage debut next year. She will star alongside Niamh Cusack and Susan Lynch in a revival of Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa at the Old Vic. The play, which follows five sisters in rural Ireland, will be directed by Anna Mackmin. The Old Vic's 2009 lineup also finds Kevin Spacey directing an in-the-round production of Complicit, a political drama by Joe Sutton, which will receive its world premiere at the theatre. </p> <p><strong>BAM Mendes</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, Sam Mendes will direct Old Vic revivals of two classic plays as part of the Bridge Project, a collaboration with Neal Street Productions and the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), designed - in Mendes's words - to \"bring classics to a new audience\". The Cherry Orchard (newly translated by Tom Stoppard) and The Winter's Tale will be performed in rep with a cast including Ethan Hawke and Simon Russell Beale.</p> <p><strong>McAvoy's Apollo mission</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338972923\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/10/24/mcavoy.jpg\" alt=\"James McAvoy\" width=\"140\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James McAvoy. Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frazer Harrison/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Apollo and the Duke of York's have also announced star draws to help them kick-start 2009. James McAvoy takes time out from his blossoming Hollywood career to star in Richard Greenberg's Three Days of Rain, which opens for previews at the Apollo from January 30 2009. He is joined by EastEnders' Nigel Harman in the story of childhood friends unlocking family secrets from the past. The Duke of York's is reviving Arthur Miller's A View from the Bridge with Ken Stott and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Stott, who became the face of Ian Rankin's Rebus on TV, recently starred in Yasmina Reza's God of Carnage. Mastrantonio is best known for playing Maid Marian in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and earned a Tony nomination on Broadway for Man of La Mancha.</p> <p><strong>Not many happy returns</strong></p> <p>There was a bittersweet celebration for Avenue Q at the Noel Coward theatre last night. The feelgood musical, which follows the ups and downs of foul-mouthed puppets on a shabby New York street, celebrated its 1000th performance at the theatre. And as the cast joked after the final curtain, here's to the next 150! The gala show came days after the announcement that the musical will close on March 28 2009. It will be replaced by a West End transfer of Calendar Girls, penned by the film's original screenwriter Tim Firth. Calendar Girls enjoyed a sold-out run at the Chichester Festival theatre last month and stars Patricia Hodge and Gaynor Faye as Yorkshire villagers who strip off to raise money for charity. </p> <p><strong>Come to the cabaret</strong></p> <p>Liza Minnelli will take up a two-week residency at the Palace on Broadway in December, marking her first performances on the Great White Way in almost a decade. The show, Liza's at the Palace, will find Minnelli backed by a 12-piece orchestra and belting out several Kander and Ebb songs, such as New York, New York. Minnelli will be joined by a quartet of dancers for a high-kicking tribute to her godmother Kay Thompson. The routine will resurrect Thompson's celebrated cabaret act of the 1940s. Minnelli's mother, Judy Garland, appeared at the Palace herself in the 50s; Liza last appeared there in 1999, when she performed songs from Garland's films. </p> <p><strong>Fasten your seatbelts</strong></p> <p>The big Broadway opening of the week was the Barrymore theatre's Speed-the-Plow, which has enjoyed rave reviews to rival the Old Vic's recent production with Kevin Spacey and Jeff Goldblum. Neil Pepe directs this revival of David Mamet's scathing play about Hollywood, starring Entourage's Jeremy Piven in his Broadway debut. For Variety's David Rooney, Piven's \"tightly wound physicality and easy command of rapid-fire, hectoring dialogue make him a natural fit for Mamet\". New York Times critic Ben Brantley says the Barrymore theatre \"should provide seat belts\" as the play \"pursues its corkscrew course at such velocity that your instinct is to check yourself for whiplash \u2026 Is cynicism supposed to be this energizing?\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the police marksmen who shot dead Jean Charles de Menezes told an inquest today that knowing he had killed an innocent man was something he would have to \"live with for the rest of my life\".</p> <p>Giving evidence for the first time, the officer from Scotland Yard's elite CO19 specialist firearms unit, identified as C12, broke down as he recalled the moment he shot De Menezes, saying he was convinced at the time the Brazilian was a suicide bomber about to detonate his device. </p> <p>Had De Menezes remained seated on the tube train when challenged by police rather than standing up and advancing he would not have been shot, the officer added.</p> <p>De Menezes' mother, Maria Otone was in court as C12 \u2013 who offered his \"sincere regret\" to the family \u2013 described his feelings when he learned the next day that the man he had shot was not Hussain Osman, one of four suicide bombers who carried out a failed attack on London's transport network the previous day.</p> <p>C12 told the inquest into the 27-year-old Brazilian's death that he felt \"a sense of disbelief and of shock, sadness, confusion\".<br> \"Everything I have ever trained for - for threat assessment, seeing threats, perceiving threats and acting on threats - proved wrong,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And I am responsible for the death of an innocent man. That is something I have got to live with for the rest of my life.\"</p> <p>The marksman told how he came face to face with De Menezes inside a cramped tube train at Stockwell station in south London on July 22 2005.</p> <p>He recalled that the electrician got up and walked towards him, and kept moving even after he shouted \"armed police\" and pointed his gun at him.</p> <p>\"He continued on his forward momentum towards me. It was at that stage that I just formed the opinion that he's going to detonate, he's going to kill us and I have to act now in order to stop this from happening.\"</p> <p>De Menezes was shot seven times in the head at point-blank range.</p> <p>Asked why he shot De Menezes three times, C12 replied: \"I had to be certain that life was extinct, that there wasn't any more threat, that this person couldn't detonate a bomb.</p> <p>\"Our training is, or has been, that a critical shot is a single shot, probably to the base of the skull, which will cause instant paralysis. I was not in a position to get there to do that. I fired the number of shots because I detected movements, albeit might have been movement caused by the bullets.\"</p> <p>The inquest was halted briefly after C12 became distressed and could not continue. When it resumed, he recalled being \"covered in blood\" after the shooting.</p> <p>As he began recounting the moment the Brazilian was killed, C12 apologised further for any distress his account caused.</p> <p>\"I will try and be as delicate as I can for the benefit of the family, but there are some things that have to be said.</p> <p>\"I can't begin to put myself in the position that they are faced with. I am a family man myself and to lose a son or any member of your family in this situation - I just couldn't believe it. And I offer my sincere condolences, I really, really respectfully do that.\"</p> <p>C12 spoke of his frustration at the lack of contact with his superiors as he prepared to intercept De Menezes. He said he could not understand a \"radio silence\" order from the Scotland Yard command centre as the Brazilian got off his bus at the station.</p> <p>\"We were very, very close to the tube station as the subject went in and I remember there being a radio silence and I was frustrated by this.</p> <p>\"If I could add that my sense of frustration was great to say the least.</p> <p>\"My thoughts then were 'He's entered the tube already' and I was just frustrated.\"</p> <p>The inquest was adjourned until Monday, when C12 will be cross-examined by the Menezes family's barrister, Michael Mansfield QC.</p>",
  "<p>In the two years since Alright, Still came out, Lily Allen has gone from being a chirpy pop starlet to a huge, magazine-shifting, tabloid-hounded celebrity. But she's back at the day job with <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lilymusic\">Everyone's At It</a>, the first finished track to emerge from her second album. It makes for a strangely jarring listen. There's appealing electrofied Klaxons sirens, drums that come pounding straight from Standing in the Way of Control-style drums and a few Confide In Me-style \"ahhs\" ... but something's not quite right. </p> <p>It could be that Lily's style and delivery are so easy to mock that she'll be forever tainted by a few well-aimed spoofs. Comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zPJK8pUXE\">Katy Brand's breezy parody</a> on ITV2 (\"I sing about my life, in this song of my life / If you think I'm going on, then fuck you, you're wrong\") was merciless. There's been lampooning from within her own culture, too \u2013 as the cruel, anonymous track <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ldnisavictim\">LDN Is A Victim</a> put it, \"This is a middle class art school thing, yeah, so put on your common accents and let's all sing.\" Each of her idiosyncrasies has been blown up and emphasised to such an massive degree now that when she rhymes \"I know this for certain\" with \"poking its head round the curtain\", it's hard not to think of Brand skipping around in a ball gown and trainers, singing about walking past a council estate once.</p> <p>But Everyone's At It suggests that these days, the characters in her songs are only riding through the city on their bikes all day to get to the next party. It's about how we're all \"putting shit up our noses\", and Lily's trying to get everyone to be honest about it, because \"the kids are in danger\". \"From what I can see, everyone's on it,\" she laments. Well, that's a showbiz bash for you.</p> <p>Going on the demos she posted on MySpace a few weeks ago, it sounds like It's Not Me, It's You has far better songs on it than this, and thankfully there's only one more that <a href=\"http://www.papermag.com/?section=article&amp;parid=2775&amp;page=3\">concerns itself with celebrity</a>, the dreaded subject matter that threatens most second albums. And that's a relief, because before all of the tabloid mania, before insulting Elton John or dying her hair pink would get her on the teatime news, Lily Allen was a proper pop star who made a likeable, timely album about rubbish boyfriends, going out and seeing her mates. Let's hope she's still got that in her.</p>",
  "<p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has admitted it is \"unacceptable\" for Arsenal captain William Gallas to have been pictured with a cigarette \u2014 but backed the Frenchman as the right man to lead his young Gunners side.</p> <p>Gallas, 31, was photographed as he left a nightclub on Thursday morning holding a cigarette in his mouth, although it was not lit. The former Chelsea player, who is set to return following a thigh injury for the trip to West Ham on Sunday, has admitted giving some \"tired\" performances this season and the incident will increase the pressure on him following some high-profile mistakes as the Gunners' title challenge folded last season.</p> <p>Arsenal have struggled defensively in his absence, with Alexandre Song and Mika\u00ebl Silvestre looking ragged even as Fenerbahce were swept aside 5-2 in midweek.</p> <p>However, Wenger made it clear that if the reports of his smoking are substantiated, he will take action. \"I didn't see the picture. I have been informed, but I don't like that,\" he said. \"I will check that with him. He has a responsibility as captain of Arsenal Football Club. That cannot be accepted. It is a public job with a public responsibility and therefore it is exactly the same for everybody.\"</p> <p>Wenger, though, maintained that Gallas could not be faulted for his commitment to the cause. \"I believe that William has a very fair assessment of his performances,\" said Wenger. \"William has worked very hard to come back from his injury and looks very sharp now.</p> <p>\"He has learned a lot. He has taken a lot of criticism, of course, but I think he took it in a positive way. He has learned a lot and he himself has come out and said, 'I made a mistake last year and I will change and re-address my attitude.'</p> <p>\"I believe he has got a lot of unfair critics and therefore I believe the fact that he could take it and he is still as motivated,\" the Arsenal manager added. \"What you can never fault with William is the motivation. He wants to do well, he wants his team to win and he has made a mistake \u2014 who didn't? Even great captains, we all make mistakes.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you had to choose the region of Britain under greatest pressure from the global demand for food it would have to be <a href=\"http://www.visiteastofengland.com/explore/default.aspx\">eastern England</a>. Ever since the second world war this landscape of big skies and broad, featureless farmlands has been the epicentre of high-input industrial agriculture.</p> <p>So it's no surprise that the region is starting to show signs of strain. A new report from the <a href=\"http://www.rase.org.uk/\">Royal Agricultural Society of England</a> (RASE) warns that deteriorating soil quality could render some parts of the country unfit for productive farming. Eastern England, with its intensive cropping for fruit and vegetables, is highlighted as a likely candidate.</p> <p>The team of leading soil scientists who wrote the report are calling for more government-backed research on food production and less on environmental protection. A good starting point might be a new national centre for soil and water management, says the report. It should look urgently at how our soils are going to adapt to climate change. Without this research, we're likely to face increased flooding and static or falling crop yields.</p> <p>As one who studied soil science along with agriculture in the 1960s, I find myself in total sympathy with this clarion call. Back in the 60s, when food shortages in western industrial countries were still imaginable, the study of soils was seen as a vital branch of science. In today's world of genetic manipulation and molecular biology, it sounds almost Victorian. The very phrase soil science conjures up pictures of brass microscopes and mahogany work-benches littered with reagent bottles.</p> <p>So it's no surprise to learn that scientists are deserting the discipline in their droves. Around the country soil science departments have closed, and key research scientists have emigrated or retired. Postgraduate research has virtually dried up.</p> <p>There's probably no better illustration of society's metropolitan attitude to the countryside than the neglect of this vital discipline and the elevation of environmental studies to pole position. If we're not careful it will be our undoing. Those in touch with the real world know that our dependence on the soil remains total.</p> <p>Terrestrial life on this planet depends, as it always has, on the chemical and biological processes that take place in the top few centimetres of earth. If the soil breaks down we and most other life forms on the planet are in big trouble. That's why the cracks showing in the intensively-farmed hectares of eastern England should be a wake-up call for us all. If our prime agricultural land is rapidly becoming sub-prime we need to find out the reasons why, and fast.</p> <p>By way of consolation, the policy-makers might like to know there need be no real conflict between food production and environmental protection. In their RASE report, the soil scientists speak of encouraging <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/\">Defra</a> \"to move from its current largely environmental policy to one which embraces production within the environmental framework\".</p> <p>What I take this to mean is that if we ensure our soils are working well, we'll get plenty of food along with a diverse and healthy countryside. If that's what they do mean then I, for one, am right behind them.</p> <p><em>To read more, visit Graham Harvey's <a href=\"http://grahamsgrassroots.blogspot.com/\">blog</a> and check out his new book, <a href=\"http://grassrootsfood.co.uk/\">The Carbon Fields</a>.</em></p>",
  "<p>On the face it using a CV writing service is a worthwhile option for the many thousands of candidates who need help, however since the advent of the internet the on line recruitment industry has been exposed to some dubious if not illegal activities relating to this type of offering.</p> <p>The biggest problem has been bogus job advertisements posted on a job board which will attract many applications from candidates. The candidates who have forwarded their CVs are then approached by the bogus advertiser who explains to them that they have a very good background which is most suitable for the advertised role. They are then informed that they would stand more chance in being asked to attend an interview if their CV was more professionally written and recommends using a professional CV writing service. He then asks if the candidate knows of any companies offering this service and if not he can recommend one. <br> The candidate at this stage has a dilemma, does he let his CV go forward without any changes and risk the chance of not going forward to the next stage of the interview or does he use a CV writing service and increase his chances in the interview process. The candidate has no reason not to believe the recommendation of the bogus recruiter and therefore makes the decision to contact the CV writing company. </p> <p>At this stage it is important to point out that there are many reputable CV writing services in the recruitment industry but in our case study the bogus advertiser will be recommending a company which they own. The candidate then contacts the recommended CV writing service and is informed that the cost to rewrite his CV by an industry expert will be \u00a3350 (approx).<br> In truth what happens is that the CV writing service is the advertiser of the job and the object of the exercise is to dupe the candidate into purchasing the CV writing service. In most cases the CV will be re-written professionally. The candidate is then informed several weeks later that the employer has decided to appoint internally and the candidate is left with a well written CV at a cost of \u00a3350.</p> <p>When approached regarding this practice the CV writing company denies all knowledge of the bogus company and claims that they were approached by the candidate and have performed a service which the candidate requested. The bogus recruiter will leave his website up for a month and then take it down and put up another website for a month and so on and so forth. On the website there is usually only an email and mobile phone contact and the offices are not real offices but the address of some serviced offices. </p> <p>If a CV writing service is the type of service a candidate feels he wishes to use then our advice is to check out other CV writing services alongside the one being recommended and at the same time be \"alarmed \" if there is no office telephone number.</p>",
  "<p>Those poor Hollywood conservatives. If <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/features/people/e3i047c06d053d60ec823bb8e72ef411538?imw=Y\">this recent report in trade bible The Hollywood Reporter</a> is to be believed, having rightwing views in the US film industry these days is a bit like being a card-carrying member of the communist party in the 1950s. The screenwriter and blogger Andrew Klavan, who is known for his conservative views, said recently that the situation had become so bad in Hollywood that he found himself being asked if he would consider submitting his scripts under an assumed name, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Trumbo\">Dalton Trumbo</a>-style. </p> <p>Nevertheless, there has been no shortage of actors ready and willing to tie their ribbon to John McCain's swiftly sinking campaign. The likes of Clint Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone and Robert Duvall have all come out publicly in favour of the Republican candidate although the list of actors in favour of Barack Obama is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rather longer. The cast of W, Oliver Stone's Bush-bashing biopic, which hits cinemas here next Friday, <a href=\"http://itn.co.uk/news/6f832aef839b3d0c5d29e486d19f4646.html\">said at the film's UK premiere on Wednesday</a> that they were supporting Obama. The famously liberal George Clooney is also in the Illinois senator's camp, along with Scarlett Johannson, Robert De Niro, Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.<br><br>Michael Moore, whose endorsement of the marginal leftwing independent Ralph Nader in 2000 was credited in some quarters for George W Bush's victory over Al Gore, has been clear in his support for Obama this time around. One assumes that the likes of Kelsey Grammer, James Woods, Jon Voight and Gary Coleman, who ganged up to lampoon Moore in the recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/30/an.american.carol\">An American Carol</a>, will be going McCain's way. As far as directors go, Ron Howard is so worried about the possibility of a McCain victory that he recently dressed up as Opie, his character from The Andy Griffith Show, and Ritchie Cunningham from Happy Days, in order to proclaim his support for Obama. <a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38844\">You can check out the video here</a> (Henry Winkler even turns up, looking remarkably well-preserved, as The Fonz.) </p> <p>It seems to be something of a tradition in the US for actors to make public their political views, in a way which has not been seen in this country for a while. In 2006 the Oscar-winning screenwriter <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4785118.stm\">Julian Fellowes claimed that British theatre was filled with leftwing writers</a>, and called for there to be more writing from a conservative perspective. But we have no real equivalent for Clooney, or the famously do-gooding Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon. </p> <p>Personally, I find that the discovery that a particular actor has views which do not tally with my own does tend to negatively affect my perspective of them. But to be honest, I'm equally irritated by actors' public outpourings of any kind. The best thespians know that it's hard for the audience to immerse themselves in your work when they know everything about you. \"If there's anything unsettling to the stomach,\" Marlon Brando once said, \"it's watching actors on television talk about their personal lives\".</p> <p>When <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/world/Sean-Penn-visits-Hugo-Chavez.4608352.jp\">Sean Penn jaunts down to south America to kick it with Hugo Chavez</a>, it doesn't make me think more kindly of the Venezuelan president's Marxist leanings, and I can see why Clooney's antics can be hard for US conservatives to swallow, even though I'm usually sympathetic to <a href=\"http://uk.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/george-clooney/clooney-darfur-plea.html\">the causes he's pushing</a>. Perhaps I'm missing the point: perhaps in a country where Dubya can be returned to power after almost ripping the world in two in his search for non-existent WMDs in Iraq, it's vital that people in the public eye stand up and offer a different perspective, but I'd really rather actors expressed themselves on film.</p> <p>The best scenes in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126059/w\">Oliver Stone's forthcoming W</a> are those in which we see Josh Brolin, as Bush, making the decision to take on Saddam Hussein. The president is determined not to make the mistakes his father did and leave the Iraqi dictator in power. Stone cleverly shows us a facet of Bush's personality which some might not have been aware of: we knew he was bull-headed, but the full extent of his simplistic, tunnel-visioned approach to hideously delicate matters of extreme complexity is here made clear. Stone's film is not a perfect piece: at times it feels rushed, and it has a contrived TV movie style that lets down what is otherwise a poignant polemic, but at least the film-maker has done his talking on celluloid. </p> <p>Like Brolin's Bush, I suspect that many of those planning to vote for McCain are not the sort for last-minute U-turns. But if the film persuades a few undecideds to vote Democrat then it will have achieved Stone's purpose. Certainly, it has already proved <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/20/max-payne-box-office\">far more successful at the US box office</a> than any of the previous attempts by film-makers to highlight the foolhardy nature of the war in Iraq, suggesting the public is becoming more open to negative assessments of the 43rd US president's period in office.</p> <p>Do you share my discomfort with actors' public endorsements of political candidates and causes?

  "<p>For weeks now, the shops here have been full of Halloween decorations (just beside the Christmas cards), and I've been trying to think when the notion of hanging up pumpkin lights and polythene witches in your window in late October became de rigueur in Ireland.</p> <p>When I was a kid, Halloween decorations meant a lantern in the window made from a carved-out turnip; pumpkins were unheard of then. Dressing up involved a cheap cardboard mask, your parents' old clothes, and a good deal of imagination and when you knocked on your neighbours' doors, you didn't say \"trick or treat\", it was \"help the Halloween party\" all the way. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174308\">Carl Sandburg</a>'s, our Halloweens were not yellow.<br> The festivities also meant food: colcannon made from mashed potato and curly kale; barm brack with a ring, pea, stick, coin and piece of rag to predict your coming year; nuts, most of which ended up shooting out of the nutcracker and across the room; and fruit, especially the grapes or apples you had to bob for in a basin of water and the apple hanging by a string, to be eaten with no hands allowed. Our Halloween may not have been quite as riotous as the one described by <a href=\"http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/robert_burns/poems/5011.html\">Robert Burns</a>, but it was pretty lively none the less.<br> Now that I look back on it, the Halloween of my youth was a really interesting blend of pagan and Catholic rituals. On this night when, as in Donne's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=173349\">The Apparition</a>, the dead come back to visit us, it was not just our individual ancestors that walked the earth; we were also visited by a vigorous ghost of earlier times, an earlier culture, other ways of living in the world.<br> By far the most popular costume of choice was the witch; in fact, witches and Halloween were so closely associated that when, as a young teenager, I first read <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=171942\">Macbeth</a> I just assumed that it was set in and around the end of October. Of course, even then the influence of the wider world and of other liminal figures was already being felt. Amongst the covens you might find the odd Dracula or Frankenstein's monster, maybe even a cowboy or two.<br> And after the gathering and the eating and the games, it would be time for stories to curdle your blood and drive away all thoughts of sleep. It's interesting to see how many poets have written poems set in these borderlands between the living and the dead, the waking world and the land of nightmare. I sometimes wonder how many of them are simply recording tales they heard at Halloween when they were young. There are so many of these poems that I'm just going to mention a few of my own favourites: there's Christina Rossetti's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=174262\">Goblin Market</a>; Poe's <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=178713\">The Raven</a>; Walter De La Mare's quietly chilling <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=177007\">The Listeners</a>; and, best of all, Browning's <a href=\"http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/268.html \">Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came</a>, recently featured in Carol Rumen's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/aug/25/poemoftheweekchildroland\">Poem of the Week blog</a>.<br> And so, you have a week to come up with Halloween poems of your own. Tales of the unexpected; memories of Halloweens gone by; verbal fireworks of any and all sorts: everything is welcome here. Help the Halloween party.</p>",
  "<p>In the world today there are between 17 and 20 million slaves. That is, people who have no civil rights, are indentured in that they owe money, and don't have the ability to change their jobs at will until their debts are paid off. And, more shocking for people in Britain, they're all around us. </p> <p>But people can't quite believe it. They don't see the migrant labourers being bussed off to work in farms or care homes, so they don't think they really exist. And even if they know they do, it's another stretch to imagine just how awful their conditions really are.</p> <p>Before I started research for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/115243/ghosts\">Ghosts</a>, I found myself thinking that maybe it's easier for the Chinese or Romanians to leave their children behind \u2013 maybe family doesn't mean to them what it does to us. But when you meet them, they're beside themselves with grief, missing the families that they've left behind to try and support.</p> <p>I worked with them undercover for a while, pretending to be South African, first up in Liverpool with people still working as cockle pickers, and then down near Birmingham with people picking spring onions. I was pretty hopeless at it. The Chinese, on the other hand, were fantastic: very clean and hard working. I was exhausted. We were getting up at 5.30am, at work by 7am. There were probably six or seven hundred of us picking away, with two toilets and no drinking water. You'd finish about 7pm. And then most people would go and work in a book factory, eventually getting some rest \u2013 if they could, in such overcrowded accommodation \u2013 at about 4am. </p> <p>But modern slavery isn't just bad for those who are being exploited. It's bad for the people doing the exploiting. And the people who are blindly part of the system. I think on the whole British people are a very fair and kind, but there's a lack of understanding about how widespread this problem is. I thought the reports were all exaggerated. I thought it was left-wing extremists stirring up trouble. It isn't. </p> <p>And that's dangerous. When people don't feel a part of another culture, aren't educated into our way of thinking and have no investment in the country, it's very easy for them to be antagonistic towards it. Ghettoising people is never a good idea. And these people feel a huge resentment against the west, against the greed that it represents. The kinder we are, the less likely we are to have aggressive behaviour coming back in our direction; terrorism, even. The more humane we are to people the nicer they are back to us. This is a problem that will come to haunt us unless we do something about it soon.</p> <p>Maybe the changes we're experiencing at the moment will help this. Perhaps the new economic regulation will translate into labour regulation. If we pride ourselves on living in a civilised country we need a realistic minimum wage, maximum working hours and proper healthy and safety regulations, and these must apply to migrant labour. There needs to be an understanding that our economy would collapse overnight if we didn't have these people doing the shit jobs that no one else does. There needs to be recognition of mutual dependency. Legislation needs to reflect that. Most importantly, our attitudes need to change. And fast.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.unchosen.org.uk/\">Unchosen film festival </a>runs for a week from tonight in Bristol.</p>",
  "<p>The storm over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>'s lavish clothing budget continued today as a watchdog group filed a campaign finance complaint against her, while the vice-presidential nominee herself blamed the row on sexism.</p> <p>In a complaint filed to the US federal election commission, the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) argued that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> violated campaign finance rules when they spent $150,000 (\u00a396,000) on clothes for Palin and her family.</p> <p>The purchases came from a joint account, controlled by both national Republicans and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign. At issue is whether the \"personal use\" ban on buying clothes with campaign money \u2013 a reform promoted by McCain himself \u2013 applies to such joint accounts.</p> <p>\"It is ridiculous that [Republicans] would spend $150,000 to outfit a vice-presidential nominee and her family at any time, but it is more outrageous given the dire financial straits of so many Americans and the state of our economy,\" said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Crew and a federal prosecutor during the Clinton administration.</p> <p>\"As if that isn't bad enough, the expenditures violate campaign finance law.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the Chicago Tribune newspaper, Palin suggested that male candidates who dressed sharply for the campaign trail would not have faced the same scrutiny.</p> <p>\"I think Hillary Clinton was held to a different standard in her primary<br>race,\" Palin said. \"Do you remember the conversations that took place about<br>her? Say, superficial things that they don't talk about with men, her<br>wardrobe and her hairstyles, all of that? That's a bit of that double<br>standard,\" she said.</p> <p>Palin said the clothes purchased were not in line with her family's personality and most of them were sitting unopened on her campaign plane. </p> <p>\"The whole thing is just bad!\" she said. \"Oh, if only people knew how<br>frugal we are. It's kind of painful to be criticised for something when all<br>the facts are not out there and are not reported.\"</p> <p>The Crew complaint is unlikely to come before the election commission<br>ahead of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">election</a> on November 4. But it does keep the Palin clothes budget on the political agenda for another day at a time when negative press of any kind could damage the McCain camp.</p> <p>Campaign finance experts are split on the legality of the purchases, with some concluding that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/us/politics/23palin.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">Republican national committee was allowed</a> to buy the clothes and other <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gN2UuEbyF64GtuHQfJzWDqDg7PqgD93VNPAG3\">election lawyers wondering</a> whether regulators would use the occasion to set a new policy on the subject.</p>",

  "<p>Jordanian police arrested a local writer on Tuesday for incorporating verses of the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book, into his love poetry, a judicial official said.</p> <p>The poet, Islam Samhan, published his collection of poems, Grace like a Shadow, which allegedly insults the holy book, without the approval of the Jordanian government, the official added. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.</p> <p>Samhan was charged with harming the Islamic faith and violating the press and publication law for combining the sacred words of the Qur'an with sexual themes. If convicted the poet could face up to three years in jail.</p> <p>Jordanian law bans the publication of any books or articles that could be seen as harmful to Islam and its Prophet Muhammad. More than two years ago, the court convicted the editors of two weekly newspapers of insulting Islam and sentenced them to two months in prison after they reprinted Danish political cartoons of Muhammad.</p> <p>Jordanian writers and artists urged the government in a collective petition to immediately release the poet, saying the arrest is a \"retreat in the freedom of expression,\" and called for an end to the \"oppression of freedom and intimidation practiced against intellectuals.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bad news for those wanting to see the new film from Charlie Kaufman: according to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/londonfilmfestival\">London film festival</a> website, next week's screenings of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/124306/synecdoche.new.york\">Synecdoche, New York</a> are both \"fully booked\". The picture has reportedly failed to secure a UK distributor, is only set for a \"limited release\" in the US and already seems to be shuffling towards the exit door, just sixth months after it was being touted as the most eagerly awaited premiere at the Cannes film festival.</p> <p>All of which suggests that Synecdoche is an unmitigated disaster; a pariah along the lines of such other unclean, unseen entities as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_day_the_clown_cried\">The Day the Clown Cried</a>. And yet I really liked Kaufman's drama, which stars <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> as a hangdog theatre director who creates an epic facsimile of his own life in a vast New York warehouse. </p> <p>Yes, it is wildly indulgent and wilfully opaque. True, it wallows in a level of miserabilism and melancholia that at times verges on the pornographic. But it is also beautifully acted, compassionate and dappled from top to tail with all manner of little epiphanies and profundities.

If the film has a flaw (and it does), it's that it positions Bush as some easily-led doofus, an insecure black sheep who only wanted to earn his daddy's love but (whoops) winds up sending America down the toilet.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Black Fantastic, Schweppes Incorporated, Rembo, Fizzy Cokah, Mountain Jew, Juice Jones, Liquid Disco, Sarsaparilla Funk, The Big Gulp, Cherry Pop. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> You just know from its title, Everybody Cha Cha, that Soda Boys' debut single is going to be a club banger, a heavy party joint, an unavoidable invitation to get down, or rather up, and boogie, as our friends in Silver Convention used to say. It's the law: any song bearing the collective pronoun is bound to be a universally inclusive thank-God-it's-Friday dancefloor anthem. Proof? Everybody Dance by Chic, Everybody Salsa by Modern Romance, Everybody Hurts by REM. OK, maybe not that one, that's more funereal than fun, but you get the point. The \"cha cha\" bit is what gives it away \u2013 not that you'll be expected to have intimate knowledge of said 50s Latin American dance, or any other antiquated terpsichorean manoeuvre, to enjoy it, although we feel the Charleston might work, if not the black bottom. <br> So who are the Soda Boys? We have no idea. They're a bunch of DJs and MCs with too much time on their hands and a desire to create Jaxx-influenced house-pop and nu disco. We know they only got together this year, and that's pretty much it. Their noms de disque don't give a lot away, being a series of pseudonyms, but we do know they're from all over the place, geographically if not emotionally. They're something of a loose collective, a rainbow coalition, who, as well as making music, operate in the worlds of art, photography and fashion. They remind us a bit of Public Enemy, not musically, but in the way they seem to divvy up the roles of the members of the band - the art and fashion side of things are the domain of Black Fantastic and Rembo, for example, while production is handled by two gentlemen called L.A.D. and Smith the Mr. The latter is also an artist in his own right and something of a recluse, who sends the music and vocals via the internet from his studio retreat while a representative attends interviews complete with an attach\u00e9 case containing a phone on which Smith the Mr responds to enquiries via a representative. Course he does. We are also alerted as to the presence on vocals of a rapper called Fizzgod the Robot, better known as Dave aka Trugoy the Dove or Plug Two from De La Soul (or David Jude Jolicoeur to his mum).  But forget facts \u2013 facts, as our other friends Talking Heads once said, just twist the truth around. All you need to know is Everybody Cha Cha is out now, and with its speed rap, memorable rising synth melody and clattering beat, is headily insistent, undeniably groovy and as invigoratingly fizzy as a mouthful of \u2013 sorry, folks - soda.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Wicked tune. Jackin' beats and intense bass. Love it!\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> And just wait till you hear their other tracks, Oh My God, The Coke and The Devil Wares [sic] Gucci. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Take your mind off the credit crisis. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Take credit for inventing a new dance sub-genre: fizzy disco. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Everybody Cha Cha is released by Soda Boys on their own label on November 3.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Basement Jaxx, Plastic Little, Playdoe, the Gibson Brothers. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sodaboy4ever\">www.myspace.com/sodaboy4ever</a><br> Monday's new band: The Operators.</p>",

  "<p>It feels like Labour's on the attack again. And no, I'm not talking about the rather sorry affair of alleged Tory fundraising tactics on a boat\u2013 sorry multimillion-pound yacht - in Corfu. But more what I'm noticing behind the scenes, not, yet at least, on the front pages.</p> <p>As a Labour candidate in a marginal seat, I get briefings emailed through many times a day. A background note on a new piece of legislation, press notices, campaign ideas and so on. Earlier this year there was a feeling among fellow candidates (most of whom are MPs) that we weren't getting enough \"attack\" lines. That the Tories were getting away with too much and not put under pressure enough to defend their own policies (or lack of policies).<br><br>Over recent weeks, I've detected a noticeable shift in the speed, quantity and quality of the attack materials coming through. I don't know whether it's the new set up in No 10 or the return of Peter Mandelson or other less reported changes, but it's working. </p> <p>A good example of this came this week. A timely and punchy \"research report\" issued by Geoff Hoon showed how the Tory proposal for a \"fair fuel stabiliser\" made in July to much media fanfare would in fact mean a 3p tax increase the cost of unleaded fuel today. </p> <p>The report dissected Cameron's policy, which would vary taxation on fuel based on changes to petrol prices. The principle of their plan is that \"when fuel prices go up, fuel duty would fall. And when fuel prices go down, fuel duty would rise,\" according to the Conservative policy document. </p> <p>Based on calculations on the Tories' own website this would result in a fuel duty increase of 3p on today's petrol prices or \u00a32.10 on a tank of fuel for a Ford Mondeo. (In July drivers were encouraged to put in their car model to the Tory website to calculate their savings \u2013 a calculation Hoon turn on its head.) </p> <p>At the same time Labour produced <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/david_camerons_tax_on_driving\">a website \"widget\"</a> for download to help create a viral campaign on the Tory proposals.</p> <p>There's been some other good stuff too.</p> <p>As the economy faces such difficulties, more tough questions need to be asked about what the Tories would do if elected. Their ideology of free markets and small government needs challenging. That has to be part of our job.</p> <p>On a final note, the <a href=\"www.mirror.co.uk\">Daily Mirror</a> has long been the home of Tory attack \u2013 sometimes serious, sometimes light-hearted and sometimes just brilliantly done. </p> <p>The Mirror's <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/10/23/revealed-the-wild-university-life-of-nat-rothschild-115875-20830894/\">Ros Wynne-Jones's account of her experiences at Oxford alongside Nat Rothschild and George Osborne</a> is one of those rare pieces that make you laugh and horrify you at the same time.

  "<p>Russian oligarchs come and go, trying to buy favour with British<br>politicians, but one figure is constant: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/rupertmurdoch\">Rupert Murdoch</a>. We now learn that Oleg Deripaska, the aluminium tycoon, wasn't the only rich man to lure a Tory on to his yacht this summer. While George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, was enjoying Deripaska's hospitality off Corfu, his leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/24/david-cameron-rupert-murdoch\">David Cameron was taking advantage of Murdoch's</a> near another Greek island, Santorini.</p> <p>According to today's <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html\">Independent</a>, he didn't pay for himself, and nor did his party pay. He was transported from a family holiday in Turkey to Santorini and back in a plane provided by Murdoch's son-in-law, Matthew Freud, a PR man. Freud also flew Cameron's wife and two children from England to Istanbul to begin their holiday, while the Tory leader made a flying visit to Georgia, paid for by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Paying court to Murdoch has become a rite of passage for British<br>opposition leaders, as though this international media mogul were some kind of monarch. It is often said that the influence of newspapers is declining. Fewer people buy them and, in any case, it is doubtful that anybody votes for a particular party because the press advises them to. But in Britain particularly \u2013 where there is no equivalent of the Murdoch-owned Fox News in the US or the \"shock jock\" radio stations \u2013 newspapers still set the agenda and determine the tone of political debate. When it comes to angling the news, the UK press still has a monopoly. Politicians live in terror of upsetting the highest circulation mass market papers, Murdoch's Sun and the Daily Mail.</p> <p>Murdoch's influence isn't confined to one-off favours. He expects to be heeded on a broad range of policies, and there's not much doubt that UK political parties are more anti-Europe, anti-regulation (particularly in the media industry) and anti-union thanks to his input. Murdoch cares above all about his businesses, and politicians know they can ignore him on social issues but not on economic ones.</p> <p>Not that anything is ever spelt out. \"You can do deals with him<br>without ever saying a deal is done,\" the former Australian premier<br>Paul Keating told Tony Blair when Blair, like Cameron, was trying to seal a likely election victory. That's what makes Murdoch so<br>dangerous. As his former executive Gus Fischer once said: \"I've never seen anybody more astute at manipulating politicians to his<br>advantage.\" The effects may not be evident until he enters Downing<br>Street, but we may be sure that Cameron has been duly manipulated.</p>",
  "<p>Blimey! Even those of us who have been gloomy on the economy all through this year were shocked by today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/24/economicgrowth-recession\">economic growth number</a>.</p> <p>We'd all been expecting a negative figure after the zero growth of the second quarter but -0.5% is a shocker. It's the first drop since the second quarter of 1992 and the biggest fall since the end of 1990.<br> Just as bad, the year-on-year growth figure slowed to just 0.3%. For an economy that has been expanding at more like 3% a year in recent years, that is a big slowdown. These numbers are simply horrible.</p> <p>We are now in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession\">recession</a>. There is no doubt, no point quibbling. For one thing, the second quarter number could well be revised down soon and in any case the fourth quarter is likely to be every bit as bad, if not worse, than the third quarter. Thus the technical definition of a recession - two quarters of contraction - is in the bag.</p> <p>Many pundits now see the economy contracting all the way through 2009, making this recession every bit as bad as those of the early 1990s or 1980s.</p> <p>What is particularly worrying is that the latest numbers show the economy was contracting even before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a> collapsed in mid-September.</p> <p>That means the latest chapter of the credit crisis will not hit the GDP numbers until the fourth quarter, so even worse is to come. Other data also point to the fact that the economy was in trouble before Lehmans.</p> <p>The latest unemployment numbers showed a surge of 164,000 in the three months to August - the biggest rise in 16 years. The rot had already set in and the events of the past few weeks will make things worse, but they are not the cause of the current economic problems.</p> <p>All of which begs the question: Where were the Bank of England's monetary policy committee while all this deterioration was going on? </p> <p>They were not cutting interest because they were worried about inflation - far too worried, as it turns out.</p> <p>Take a look at this passage from the minutes of the MPC's meeting in early September - it's scary.</p> <p>\"Most members judged that maintaining Bank Rate at 5% this month was necessary if inflation was to be brought back to the target in the medium term. That would continue to balance the upside and downside risks to inflation appropriately. For most of these members, although there had been news on the month about both of these risks, it had not significantly changed the medium-term outlook for inflation described in the August Report.\" </p> <p>Remember that oil had already tumbled by September, along with other commodity prices, so inflation was already set for a big drop. But some of the committee were still discussing RAISING interest rates in September to ensure inflation didn't feed through into higher wage demands. Meanwhile, back in the real world, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/23/jcb-pay-cut-jobs\">JCB</a> yesterday announced its workers had accepted a pay cut to protect their jobs. What wage inflation?</p> <p>It seems only Professor David Blanchflower was on the case in September. Here are his comments from the minutes:</p> <p>\"For one member, the prospects for UK demand had clearly worsened over the month, increasing substantially the downside risk to inflation in the medium term. There was no evidence that inflation expectations were pushing up nominal pay growth. The slowdown might be amplified by financial institutions' responses to increased financial fragility. A significant undershooting of the inflation target in the medium term, at a time when output and employment would be well below potential, risked damaging the credibility of the monetary framework.\"</p> <p>Blanchflower voted to cut rates half a point - the others outvoted him and left rates at 5%. A month later they were all voting to cut by half a point. The penny had finally dropped.</p> <p>So what does this mean for the future? Well, the MPC have to cut rates and fast. Having them at 4.5% is a waste of time. They need to cut 1% in November and another 1% in December if this economy is going to do anything other than suffer a huge recession with a million or more people losing their jobs.</p> <p>Those are big moves, and ones of a size the MPC has never done before. But if they don't get on this recession case right now, anything could happen.</p> <p>These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary things have happened, especially when you look at the Treasury's massive rescue plan for the banks unveiled this month. </p> <p>The Treasury - not the Bank - has taken on the job of trying to get finance flowing to small businesses again. The government has formed a National Economic Council to respond to this crisis and brought in people like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/24/economy-banking-myners-phillip-green\">Paul Myners</a> to help.<br> The chancellor, Alistair Darling, has already said he will tear up the fiscal framework because the crisis is so bad. If the MPC doesn't get on with the business of getting rates down quickly, who's to say the Treasury won't take back control of interest rates?</p>",
  "<p>Meat is bad for the planet, but I must admit I can't quite give it up and my general search for a low-guilt, low-carbon solution carries on. So far I've cut down as much as possible, and concentrated on only ever buying meat from a nearby farm and a lovely butcher who gets everything locally. Still the guilt (I blame the nuns!) roars on.</p> <p>This week however I came up with a new solution: rabbit. They sell them in my local butcher, hanging by their hind legs from a butcher's hook at the back, skin and bunny ears still on. Rabbits live wild, spend their days bouncing happily around the hills, eating grass, discussing who'll play Bigwig in Watership Down II, and generally living life to the full until the rabbiters come out. Their carbon footprint? Just the farting and the exhaust fumes of their killers, I should think. </p> <p>I asked how they were selling: \"like gold dust\" apparently, the butcher had got 75 in on Friday, and today (Monday) had only the three left hanging there. In fact rabbit seems to be making a bit of a comeback, unsurprisingly really: it's not only green but it's reasonably cheap (my butcher was selling them for \u00a33.50, but I've heard tales of them changing hands for a couple of quid) and in these credit crunch days that is no small thing.<br> But are you ready for the reality check? Look, I really wish that I was like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/feb/13/foodanddrink.features11\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall </a>and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-368300/Should-Jamie-slit-lambs-throat-TV.html\">Jamie Oliver</a> and raised my own pigs and scratched their backs and chuckled at back episodes of <a href=\"http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Pigs_in_Space\">Pigs In Space</a> together before slitting their throats but the reality is that all the meat I've ever bought has been skinned and ready for the pot. </p> <p>But not rabbit. This is how the buying bit unfolds: I ask for the rabbit, the butcher reaches it down and then grabs the cleaver to his right. Wham! Off comes the little bunny head. Wham! Wham! Off come the little bunny feet. Whuuzzt! Off comes - oh my god - the lovely soft bunny fur. Then chop, chop, chop, the whole bloody lot is swept into a bag and tied up and handed over the counter, the butcher still chatting away about how the rabbit market is moving as I try to keep a polite expression on my face.</p> <p>You definitely cross a certain boundary when you start eating rabbit. Is it just because of the often-commented-on \"cuddly-animal\" paradigm, where attractive animals like otters, penguins, blue whales, get more attention and support than slugs (not endangered, I hasten to add, sadly) and slow worms (which are a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/281.shtml\">protected species</a> in Britain, in case you didn't know)? </p> <p>I know at least one person who point blank refuses to contemplate eating rabbit, and we regularly act as if the French are a nation of murderers because of their fondness for horse, frog legs, snails, foie gras (okay, that last one is pretty psychopathic). But that is all going to have to change if we want to keep eating meat. We're going to have get a lot more accepting, and ickle-wickle bunny rabbits are just the beginning. It's that or tofu.</p>",
  "<p>We anti-conspiracy theorists have been mocked this week for suggesting there may be less than meets to eye to the yachtgate row, enjoyable though it has been for fans of Peter Mandelson, George Osborne and Oleg Deripaska (Russia's now-famous Mr Aluminium) - not to mention the novels of Evelyn Waugh.</p> <p>As the tale slips down the news agenda, at least until Sunday morning, it's prudent to ask: were we wrong? Earlier this week the official, off-the-record Tory line was that Mandelson had manipulated Nathaniel Rothschild into falling out with his old Bullingdon chum, Osborne, for betraying their August chit-chat.<br><br>We laughed at this, not unkindly, when we heard it from Conservative press officers \u2013 as we called them in more innocent days, before someone (possibly me) imported the self-promoting term \"spin doctor\" from the US in 1988. Did they really think even the Crown Prince of Darkness could sway such a rich, wild and worldly figure as the next Lord Rothschild, could persuade him to wreck an old and intimate friendship in so public a way?</p> <p>My working assumption was that - unless there were motives as yet unknown - this was essentially a social row that had got out of hand. By grassing up Mandelson when a guest of Rothschild, Osborne had embarrassed his Buller chum, as well as his yachtgate host and business partner, Mr Aluminium. Red faces all round, much anger, bad manners, bad form.</p> <p>The Tory tack has changed now. Today <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/2539376/osborne-stumbles-but-is-there-a-bigger-story-about-mandelson.thtml\">The Spectator</a>, the London <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23576973-details/The+\u00a35+billion+reason+Rothschild+knifed+his+friend+George+in+the+back/article.do\">Evening Standard</a> and its sister paper, the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1080165/Was-Osborne-knifed-Now-Mandelson-faces-questions-links-Russian-tycoon-plans-5bn-super-rich-haven-Montenegro.html\">Daily Mail</a>, plus others I can't afford because the FT is so expensive, all reflect the new line to take.</p> <p>It is to hint that it is really all about Deripaska's business empire, its ambitions, its current financial pressures (he needs to refinance loans in a global financial crisis) and the possibly sinister role in all this played by ex-EU trade commissioner Mandelson.</p> <p>Today's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/24/mandelson-labour\">Guardian plays a role in all this by revealing that Mandelson was seen dining with Mr Aluminium</a> in a Moscow restaurant as early as 2004, two years before the \"few social gatherings in 2006 and 2007\" mentioned in his statement; earlier too than reports of them meeting in 2005.</p> <p>This could prove significant, if more important developments surface. Meanwhile it's all grist to the conspiracy mill, which is now turning up photos of a hitherto little known port in Montenegro called Tivat. Apparently \"Hungary's biggest property developer\", a firm also called Tivat, co-owned by Nat Rothschild and a Canadian called Peter Munk, want to develop the old Yugoslavian naval base there as the new Monte Carlo.</p> <p>And Deripaska? He is apparently Montenegro's biggest employer (yes, it's aluminium), its Lord Ashcroft, you might say, in view of the Tory bankroller's mega-standing in Belize. According to the Mail, he makes the key calls to Montenegrin pols. </p> <p>According to the Standard, he also makes them to top politicos in places you've probably never heard of - like the remote Russian republic of Kalmykia, whose president promised in his campaign to buy every shepherd a mobile phone and sign up Diego Maradona for the local team. If only Gordon could be so imaginative!</p> <p>Lots of other Russian schemes, deep in the Wild East, are also mentioned. This is all great fun, wily foreigners with funny names, very probably with moustaches too. Sacha Baron Cohen will be found to have been on Mr Aluminium's vulgar gin palace, Queen K, if we search all the lifeboats. Lord Byron's name \u2013 always one to panic shareholders \u2013 has already been invoked. He passed through Tivat and liked it.</p> <p>So the real offence, so the new theory goes, must have been that Osborne inadvertently put Deripaska's name (try calling him \"Terry Pascoe\", it's easier) up in lights at a time when he is firefighting troubles within his empire: court cases, refinancing and stuff. The allegedly mooted \u00a350k donation was chicken feed. Proper money is at stake, not least in a complex court case over the disputed sale of Russia's second biggest insurance firm, Ingosstrakh. Mandelson's office became involved via MEPs who were supporting EU shareholders who blamed Deripaska when the value of their stake in Ingosstrakh was reduced.</p> <p>This may be important or it may be froth. It doesn't stop there: it never does. New Labour's Lord Byron (a fellow peer, did you notice?) apparently championed Montenegro's entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), an epochal event you may have missed. Nudge, nudge. I am beginning to see why Messrs Cameron and Osborne embraced the new American \"nudge theory\" last summer, though it was thought at the time to mean ways of persuading (but not instructing) voters to adopt better dietary habits.</p> <p>So, we are back where we were a month ago when Mandelson was recalled to the unByronic Brown cabinet. The papers are digging hard in search of conflict of interest, improper conduct and, failing all that, our old friend \"errors of judgment\" on Lord M's part (and Master George's). </p> <p>The diggers may yet turn something up, but before you invest in those costly Sunday papers, let alone put spare savings into buying land in Tivat, remember, they have had a month on the case already, with little to show for it except nudge, nudge. Perhaps the Nudge Hotel should be next to the Lord Byron when Tivat becomes the new Monte Carlo, or even the new Poole Harbour.</p> <p>As things stand, Mandelson has sustained some damage, though the spectacle of watching Sky News covering him making a business speech last night in Easington was a tribute to his box-office appeal. Osborne's flashily dangerous sense of style has also sustained more damage, though Dave is standing by him. Reports that William Hague is boning up to become shadow chancellor are premature. </p> <p>My hunch remains that Mandelson and Osborne will survive, albeit a little more shop-soiled. We'll see.</p> <p>Cameron, incidentally, is fingered in <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html\">today's Indy for using Matt Freud's private plane</a> to slip off from his Turkish hols to Santorini in Greece, where he paid court to Matt's father-in-law, Rupert Murdoch. New Labour is hardly is a position, alas, to protest at such grovelling. The Great Schmoozer's own gin palace was later moored off Corfu. </p> <p>Surely, at his age, Rupert should be careful on such boats. Remember how poor old Bob Maxwell slipped and fell. But that is not our concern. Result so far? Much fun and laughter at the expense of politicians with a weakness for bling, nothing more serious, not so far.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/24/corfu-party-funding-george-osborne\">Martin Kettle makes a good point in today's Guardian when he reminds liberals to temper their outrage</a>. Barack Obama has been raising vast private sums to outspend John McCain in the US presidential elections, some of it undoubtedly from very dodgy scumbags of all colours as well as widows' mites. Basking in media approval, he has done so with little complaint from his own side.</p>",
  "<p>\"Building America\" is the slogan of the <a href=\"http://www.uprr.com/aboutup/photos/diesel_passenger.shtml\">Union Pacific Railroad</a>. Emblazoned along the \"Armour yellow\" flanks of its brawny diesel-electric locomotives and accompanied, since 2001 by a billowing representation of the Stars and Stripes, this is no idle boast. West of Chicago, the UP is the biggest landowner in the States, and second only in the union to the federal government. Its trains run on 32,200 route miles of track through 23 states across two-thirds of the United States. It employs 49,000 people, boasts a fleet of 8,700 locomotives and transports prodigious quantities of freight, from fruit to coal and steel and all manner of manufactured goods up hill and down dale from a railroad fault line you can draw on the map from Chicago to New Orleans and across to and up and down the Pacific coast.</p> <p>The 146-year old railroad's logo, a shield bearing the name Union Pacific in white, bold futura-font capitals on a blue background above red and white stripes surrounded by a blue border is one of the most evocative, and most zealously protected, of all US logos, and as all-American as the UP itself. This logo has remained pretty much unchanged since it appeared in 1950, and even then its essential form was determined as long ago as 1888, when what had looked like a special federal agent's badge, introduced the year before, appeared in national colours. This instantly became one of the most recognised and respected of all US corporate logos.</p> <p>That original colour logo was the work of UP passenger agent, Edward L Lomax, who, it's said, drew the thing at least a hundred times before he felt he'd got it right. He certainly did get it right; how many other logos have, despite some minor changes, lasted quite so long? Crisp and clear, the 1950 version remains a symbol of the railroad's strength and organisation, symbolic of its battling breathtakingly long and heavy trains across the vast and sometimes formidable landscapes of the American mid-west. </p> <p>These are the mighty freight trains you sometimes stop for at crossings outside Cheyenne, Denver, Tuscon or El Paso in shimmering heat or marrow-chilling snows that seem to thunder on interminably at 60mph and more. They must be a mile long; you can't help thinking as the rhythm of the passing cars becomes hypnotic. They are. </p> <p>Sadly, although the UP is in very good shape commercially and is by far the biggest railroad in the States, it gave up running regular long distance passenger trains in 1971. It does operate a number of suburban services in and around Chicago, and sends out the occasional, and hugely popular, passenger special behind one of its two most impressive magnificent steam locomotives. </p> <p>The railroad played a heroic role during the second world war when its hugely powerful Challenger and Big Boy locos sent so much of the raw material, men and machines from across the States to help squash the Nazi war effort. Even before then, the UP was as much legend as fact; Cecil B DeMille even made an epic, Union Pacific [1939] mythologising the creation of this, the first of the American transcontinental railways, in the late 1860s.</p> <p>One day, perhaps Americans, tired of the demeaning drudge of modern air travel will return to trekking across their continent by regular fast trains. From Chicago to San Francisco, from New Orleans to LA these would battle the landscape and elements thrusting their UP shield against all opposition. The latest variant of the logo has sprouted stylised eagle's wings, suggestive of speed as well as power; it would be just right for a new generation of epic, transcontinental American expresses.</p>",
  "<p>Everyone now recognises the need to reform the international <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics\">economic</a> regime. But the idea should not simply be to fix a system that is obviously broken: we need to exchange it for a better model. That is because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">current financial architecture has failed</a> in some very important ways. </p> <p>Most importantly, the international financial system has failed to meet two obvious requirements: of preventing instability and crises, and of transferring resources from richer to poorer economies. Not only have we experienced much greater volatility and propensity to financial meltdown across emerging markets and now even industrial countries, but even the periods of economic expansion have been based on the global poor subsidising the rich. </p> <p>These global failures are so immense that they constitute enough reason to abandon this system. But there are other associated failures in terms of what the regime has implied within national economies: it has encouraged pro-cyclicality; it has rendered national financial systems opaque and impossible to regulate; it has encouraged bubbles and speculative fervour rather than real productive investment for future growth; it has allowed for the proliferation of parallel transactions through tax havens and looser domestic controls; it has reduced the crucial developmental role of directed credit. </p> <p>So we clearly need a new system, even if the goals remain the same as that of the original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system\">Bretton Woods</a>: to ensure currency stabilisation through international monetary cooperation; to encourage the expansion of international trade in a stable way; and to promote development by facilitating productive investment. </p> <p>To achieve this in the current context, four elements are crucial. First, the belief that self-regulation supported with external risk assessment by rating agencies is an adequate way to run a financial system has been blown sky-high. There is no alternative, therefore, to systematic state regulation of finance. </p> <p>Second, since private players will inevitably attempt to circumvent regulation, the core of the financial system \u2013 banking \u2013 must be protected, and this is only possible through social ownership. Therefore, some degree of the socialisation of banking (and not just socialisation of the risks inherent in finance) is also inevitable. In developing countries it is also important because it enables public control over the direction of credit, without which no country has industrialised. </p> <p>Third, to cope with the adverse real economy effects of the current crisis, fiscal stimulation is essential in both developed and developing countries. Enhanced public expenditure is required to prevent economic activity and employment from falling, to manage the effects of climate change and promote greener technologies, and to advance the development project in the south. </p> <p>Fourth, we need an international economic framework that supports this, which in turns means that capital flows must be controlled and regulated so that they do not destabilise any of these strategies. </p> <p>It may be argued that such an international system based on state regulation will reduce the possibility of developing countries to access much-needed capital for their own economic expansion. But this perception is wrong, because in fact the current liberalised system did <em>not</em> provide for a net transfer of resources to the developing world. In the past six years, there has been a net flow of financial resources from every developing region to the north, primarily the US, even as global income disparities have increased. And within countries, the idea that deregulated finance could put more resources in the hands of the poor (as in sub-prime lending) has proved to be unsustainable. </p> <p>So greater state involvement in economic activity is now both necessary and desirable. The time for arguing about whether to have it or not is over. Instead, we should be thinking of how to make such involvement more democratic and accountable, within our countries and internationally.</p>",

Burton then left the project and it had looked dead in the water until Columbus, who's best known for big-budget family-oriented fare such as the first two films in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harrypotter\">the Harry Potter series</a>, pitched his own idea.</p> <p>The completely new take on the story of the newspaper columnist-explorer Robert Ripley immediately found favour with both Carrey and studio Paramount, and now looks set to be filmed for a 2011 release, with the aim of becoming the first film in a franchise. The plan to shoot in China appears to have been ditched.</p> <p>Ripley became famous worldwide in the 1920s for Believe It or Not!, a cartoon series about unusual facts from around the globe. Nicknamed the \"modern Marco Polo\" because he travelled to over 200 countries, Ripley was determined to search anywhere to find the quirkiest facts for his cartoon series.</p> <p>Carrey will next be seen on our screens in the comedy Yes Man, in which he plays a man who challenges himself to say \"yes\" to everything for an entire year, while Columbus recently wrapped the high school comedy I Love You, Beth Cooper, starring Hayden Panettiere from the TV show Heroes.</p>",
  "<p>In yet another indication of the shifting priorities in international cricket, the boards of Australia, South Africa and New Zealand have announced plans for a new Twenty20 tournament. The competition would feature eight city-based, franchise-owned sides playing across all three nations. The inaugural edition is due to take place in 2011. It is a similar model to that used in the Indian Premier League. </p> <p>The eight sides would be split into two conferences, one based in Africa and the other in Australasia. The top teams from each conference would play off in the tournament finals. It would be scheduled to allow the competing players to also appear in the IPL, and it is understood that the Board of Control for Cricket in India have also agreed to make players available for the new competition. </p> <p>The boards of the three concerned nations have been in discussions about the idea for the past year. The tournament is the latest addition to an increasingly crowded roster, joining the World Twenty20, the IPL, the rebel ICL, the English Premier League, the Champions League and the multitude of Stanford competitions. The new tournament will not replace the countries' existing domestic Twenty20 tournaments. </p> <p>CA spokesman Peter Young addressed concerns over the crowding of the fixture list with assurances that the new competition \"will be short, sharp and very focused but the exact number of games is yet to be determined. Strategically we see that there's a finite amount of Twenty20 cricket that's likely to be ideal, with a number of major global blocks\".</p> <p>Justin Vaughan, chief executive of NZC, reiterated those ideas: \"The challenge for the three southern-hemisphere boards is to create the stage for that opportunity to be captured in a way which complements international cricket.\"</p> <p>It is initially thought that the competition would take place in October, and that the winning team would be entered into the Champions League competition. </p> <p>CA chief executive James Sutherland said: \"Regional-level T20 cricket played at the level immediately below international cricket has shown it can capture the public imagination and create new audiences for cricket. But as we have seen in India, it needs critical mass to generate major public excitement and the regional concept we have been charged with developing provides that critical mass.\" </p> <p>For cricket as a whole you sense the proliferation of Twenty20 tournaments means that a critical mass of a quite different kind may soon be reached, and the consequences for the future of the sport may be more dramatic than anyone now imagines.</p>",
  "<h2>What has been announced?</h2> <p>The government has amended its pensions bill to make it easier for people to boost the amount of state pension they are entitled to receive. To claim the full state pension - currently \u00a390.70 a week - you must have built up a certain number of qualifying years during your working life. You can make up any years you may have missed - for example through child care or ill health - by making a voluntary national insurance contribution, but the current rules say you can only make up the most recent six years of missing payments. </p> <p>The government now plans to allow you to make up an additional six years from any time in your career. However, the rule will apply only to those who reach state pension age before April 5 2015 and who have 20 qualifying years under their belts.</p> <h2>What is the state pension age?</h2> <p>The state pension age is 65 for men and 60 for women who were born on or before April 5 1950. Between 2010 and 2020 the retirement age for women will rise to 65 too. Between 2024 and 2046 it will rise to 68 for everyone.</p> <h2>What is a qualifying year?</h2> <p>It is a year in which you have earned enough to make national insurance contributions. In the 2008-09 tax year this is \u00a34,680 or more for employees, and \u00a34,825 or more for the self-employed. </p> <h2>How many qualifying years do I need? </h2> <p>To get any state pension at all you must have at least 10 qualifying years as a man and nine as a woman. To get a full state pension the number of years you need depends on your sex and when you plan to retire. If you reach state pension age before April 5 2010 and you are a man you will need 44 qualifying years to get the full state pension; if you are a woman you will need 39 years. After April 5 2010 everyone will need to have accumulated 30 qualifying years.</p> <p>Currently you can reduce the number of years you need to qualify to as few as 20 through home responsibilities protection - this is available if you are receiving child benefit or caring for someone sick or disabled. After 2010 this is set to be replaced by NI credits. </p> <h2>Who will benefit from the rule change?</h2> <p>Anyone who has taken time out of the workplace - mothers and carers are among the biggest groups to benefit - or has worked overseas. Currently, around 90% of men qualify for the full state pension, but only 35% of women do. The government says that around 555,000 people could benefit from the removal of the six-year top-up rule, while the full package of changes could mean that by 2025 90% of women qualify for a full state pension.</p> <h2>How do I know if I have to make up my qualifying years?</h2> <p>You need to add up how many years you have worked and paid national insurance, and how many more you are set to do before you reach the state retirement age, and you can see if you have enough qualifying years. If you have any doubts as to whether you have paid NI contributions for every year you have worked you can call the national insurance enquiry helpline on 0845 915 5996 to check your record. The Pension Service can also provide you with a <a href=\"https://secure.thepensionservice.gov.uk/statepensionforecast/\">state pension forecast</a>.</p> <h2>How much does it cost to make up contributions?</h2> <p>At the moment it is \u00a3420 for each qualifying year, but in April 2009 that will rise to \u00a3625. Making up the full 12 years will cost \u00a37,500.</p> <h2>Is it worth it?</h2> <p>Each extra year of National Insurance contributions adds around \u00a3160 a year to the state pension that people are entitled to so for many people the answer is, yes, says Ros Altmann, spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.pensionstheft.org/\">Pensions Action Group</a>. However, she warns that for some people on low and middle incomes paying to make up the missing years will be counter-productive. Pension credits guarantee all pensioners an income of at least \u00a3124.05 a week. If you have no other pension arrangements it will not be worth building up your state pension when you will qualify for this benefit anyway.</p>",

He has never seen the need to balance his team with men and women, and has relied almost totally on a blokeish crowd \u2013 with the exception of his unflappable chief of staff <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jun/29/uk.labour\">Sue Nye</a> and his close friend <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/gordonbrown/page/0,,2123116,00.html\">Lady Shriti Vadera</a>.</p> <p>I remember embarrassing Brown during the 2001 election campaign, which he was running, by asking why there was only ever one female MP on the campaign platform and she was rarely allowed to speak. I also put a question to the sole woman that morning \u2013 Estelle Morris \u2013 who started to respond. But immediately, Brown interrupted her and took over the answer. Cue laughter from the hacks. But I was berated afterwards by one of Brown's \"blokes\" who insisted that Gordon was very much aware of women's issues. </p> <p>I doubted it then, and I doubt it now. The last couple of weeks have seen two dreadful retreats: first on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/mandelson-worklifebalance\">plans for more flexible working</a>, which would have hugely benefited women with older children and elderly parents. And then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/21/health-health\">on abortion</a>. By refusing to allow MPs to debate abortion now, under the embryology bill, the government argues that a better debate can be held within the next two years. Well, in case they haven't noticed, the complexion of the House of Commons is likely to have changed within the next two years, with a Tory election victory. And no surprises for guessing what the result of an abortion debate will be then. It certainly won't help those who want to give women more control over their lives. </p> <p>But just as I am despairing of this government's attitude to women, along comes a massive victory. After months of nudges, winks, then setbacks followed by more behind the scenes re-assurance, the Department of Work and Pensions has seen sense, and allowed hundreds of thousands of women the right to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/24/economy-pensions\">full state pension</a>. These are the women who were not entitled to much under the old system because they had taken a break from paying national insurance contributions, usually to care for children or relatives. Now, instead of only a third of all women qualifying for a full state pension when they reach retirement age, the majority will do so, if they chose to make one-off payments to make up those missing contributions. </p> <p>When I have written about the campaign to right this wrong over the years, I've received scores of emails from women who really were concerned about an old age in poverty. Yet ministers kept fobbing off those doughty campaigners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/22/leadersandreply.mainsection\">Patricia Hollis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.helenjackson.labour.co.uk/\">Helen Jackson</a>, the former Labour MP. </p> <p>Hollis and Jackson never gave up, mobilising a wide coalition of MPs, pressure groups, trade unionists and media supporters. It took them more than two years to win this victory. Now it's time to turn attention to flexible working and abortion \u2013 let's hope it doesn't take quite as long this time.</p>",

  "<p>Thousands of women who have stayed at home to look after their children will get the chance to qualify for a full state pension by making a top-up payment, the government announced today.</p> <p>James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, is going to amend the pensions bill currently going through parliament to make it easier for women to qualify for a full basic state pension, currently worth \u00a387.30 a week.</p> <p>Under current rules women have to make national insurance payments \u2013 which are paid when someone is in work \u2013 for 39 years to qualify for a full state pension. Men have to make the payments for 44 years.</p> <p>Until now people have been able to \"buy back\" up to six missing years, with a one-off payment of \u00a3420 a year, to make up for the years when they have not paid national insurance because they have not been working.</p> <p>Today Purnell is announcing that people will be able to \"buy back\" another six years. The Department for Work and Pensions said that up to 555,000 people could benefit.</p> <p>The announcement was welcomed by some campaigners who say that, for many people, making a one-off national insurance payment would be sensible because the amount they would spend would be more than offset by the amount they would gain.</p> <p>But one expert warned that, for some people, it would not be a worthwhile investment because they might lose the means-tested pension credit.</p> <p>Only around a third of women reaching pension age qualify for a full basic state pension.</p> <p>Today's move marks a change of heart for the government, which last year overturned an amendment to the pensions bill designed to give people the opportunity to buy back extra years of missed contributions.</p> <p>Purnell said: \"The pensions bill will transform pension provision and finally bring equality for women and carers so that by 2010 around 75% of women reaching state pension age will be entitled to a full basic state pension, rising to 90% by 2025, compared to around 35% today.</p> <p>\"This is fair, affordable and straightforward and it will give more people the chance of a secure future to look forward to in retirement.\"</p> <p>The policy will apply to both men and women who reach state pension age between April 5 2008 and April 5 2015 and already have 20 years on their NI record, but in practice women will make up around 90% of those who will benefit, the DWP said.</p> <p>Purnell also praised Lady Hollis of Heigham, who has tried several times to amend the law to allow women to make top-up payments.</p> <p>\"Baroness Hollis has championed the cause of those people, mainly women and carers, who are potentially disadvantaged in retirement as a result of not having a full work history,\" he said. \"So I'm delighted to pay tribute to Baroness Hollis.\"</p> <p>Age Concern, which has a long-running campaign to change pension rules, welcomed the U-turn.</p> <p>A spokesman for the campaign group said: \"We are absolutely thrilled. The government should be congratulated for finally delivering a fairer deal for women and carers.\"</p> <p>But Ros Altmann, a spokeswoman for the Pensions Action Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that making one-off national insurance payments would not be suitable for everyone</p> <p>\"The idea is that the cost of buying a year's worth of extra pension is much less than the value of the extra pension you will get during a normal period of retirement,\" she said.</p> <p>Buying an extra year's worth of pension should cost around \u00a3400, and many women will find it a good investment, even if they have to borrow money to afford it, said Altmann.</p> <p>But she warned that women ought to seek advice before committing money, as a sizeable proportion of those on low and middle incomes would anyway be entitled to \u00a3130 a week in state pension under the pension credit.</p> <p>And she added: \"Obviously, some women will say, 'Why do I have to buy it? Why don't I just get it as an entitlement?' Some women could be fearful that if they are not well and die quickly they won't get the value.\"</p> <p>Altmann said it would be better to reform the whole state pension system so that it is not dependent on payment of national insurance contributions during a working life.</p>",

It's not surprising, for those who know these companies' outputs, that his indie games have a taste of the god sim to them. Take <a href=\"http://www.democracygame.com\">DemocracyGame</a>, a politics game that's been used in classrooms and - as he told me - was even considered for use by the US Department of Defense. </p> <p>Kudos 2, his latest indie release as <a href=\"http://www.positech.co.uk/\">Positech</a>, is a lighter offering. We put him through the game pitch process to find out more. Keep reading for his take on why Spore didn't work, and why he hopes indie games developers will never rule the world.<br><br><strong>Explain your game to my mum in 140 words.</strong><br>Kudos 2 is about how you choose to live your life from age twenty to thirty. You start off with a bad job and not much education, and depending how you choose to spend your time each day, you get a better job, meet new people, have a relationship, and change your personality and mood. You can end up being happy and sociable with an average job, or career minded and wealthy but perhaps a bit lonely. The game asks you what to do each day after work, and you can either go to evening classes, socialise, spend time alone or do things like read a book. How you spend each day, and what you aim to achieve in those ten years is entirely up to you, and the game is basically about balancing the pressures of life.</p> <p><strong>How do players control the game?</strong><br>The game is in 2D, and you have some indicators which show you how your characters currently feeling about everything. During the day, a diary shows you how your days has gone, and in the evening you select different menu options to pick how you spend that evening, so there are buttons for you to select from a list of solo activities, and a mobile phone that will flash when people invite you out or have a message for you. The interface for the game is a bit unusual because there isn't really a normal genre for games like this.</p> <p><strong>What is your background?</strong><br>I started coding age 11 on the Sinclair ZX81, but never got to finish a decent sellable game back then. I did a succession of weird jobs (guitar teacher, boat builder, stock market computer engineer...) before eventually working at Elixir studios as a game programmer, than at Lionhead doing AI for the movies. I then did a brief bit of work for Maxis and since then I've worked from home making indie games out of a bedroom. I'm a real bedroom coder, none of this having a separate office malarkey.</p> <p><strong>Name your competitors.</strong><br>Everyone and everything. Many people would say Maxis, because of the Sims and maybe I compete with Stardock over 'The Political machine', but my games appeal to a lot of non gamers. I think people who study politics and economics are people who would play Democracy and anyone who reads those self-help and motivational psychology books would love Kudos. games don't just compete with each other, we compete with TV, Books and pubs. I'm lucky in that my games are a new '2D turn based strategy-sim' genre, so I don't have any absolutely clear competition.</p> <p><strong>How many players do you have now and what's your target in 12 months?</strong><br>My games tend to sell a few thousand copies each, but a lot of people who buy one of my games buy all of them. I'd like to do a game that sells ten thousand copies direct from me, but I've never achieved that. Maybe this time? A lot more people buy my games through online portals, but they don't even tell you how many, which is a bit annoying.</p> <p><strong>What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>Getting people to try the demo. I do 2D games that are more about the gameplay than the graphics. Most people who start playing them really get into them, but I have to overcome the fact that when you see screenshots of Kudos next to Crysis, people try out the shiny looking thing first. It's also a problem to get much coverage of an indie game, because you are just one person doing everything, including the code, most of the artwork, the business side and the testing, so marketing and PR is just a tiny part of a long working day.</p> <p><strong>What's the weirdest development experience you've had thus far?</strong><br>Feeling empathic for Tony Blair. I'm not a huge Blair fan, so it was very weird. When I coded Democracy I was trying to make as accurate a model of political systems and choices as I could, and it led to tons of emergent gameplay I hadn't even considered. I found myself making false promises to the electorate, making huge compromises and cutting spending on stuff I wanted to increase, all whilst pandering to extremist groups purely because they were swing voters. All the kind of stuff you hate in politicians. It was weird because I didn't code any of that into the game, it just emerges from accurate modeling of how and why people vote.</p> <p>The other weird thing was arranging for Julianne Regan (All About Eve) to record some music for Kudos: Rock legend. This was someone whose first album is in my car, and whom I went to see play live as a teenager, and suddenly she was contributing music to one of my games. I was a bit star struck by that, and it still seems a bit weird.</p> <p><strong>What's your distribution/publishing plan?</strong><br>I sell my games direct from my website, and also through online portals such as Yahoo and Stardocks Impulse. I think in future I'll likely continue as I am, because I like having direct contact with the gamers rather than sticking a layer between us (the publisher). People who buy games like being able to contact the actual designer, rather than just ranting on a forum the designer will never read. I know that limits the extent to which my business can scale, but I'd hate to think that Positech became just like any other big games company with no connection to it's customers. I would like to get my games on Steam, but apart from that, I'm happy with how things are.</p> <p><strong>Are indie games the latest killer app?</strong><br>Indie games are the secret weapon the consoles can never, ever beat, because they exist outside the confines of what console approval committees think are cool. All new genres and classic games tend to be those that all the people in suits at publishers thought would flop. The ability for just anyone to sit down and make a game they think is cool is a wonderful thing. Imagine a world where books had to be approved by one of three companies before being written. I'd hate to live in a world where gaming was defined purely by Microsoft or Nintendo. Plus indie gaming keeps niche genres alive. The only hardcore hex strategy games, 2D shooters and classic RPGs are being done by small indie teams. The big publishers have abandoned those genres entirely, so more power to indies for catering to those of us who don't just like Halo and Gears Of War.</p> <p><strong>Are you the next big thing?</strong><br>No. And that's a good thing. The next big thing by definition will appeal to everyone, which waters stuff down and caters to the average. I'd much rather have 2% of the market and be making exactly what they want, and earning a nice living, than giving the other 98% something they thing is just ok, and owning a private yacht. I could make my games more mass market by simplifying them, but that would kill off the spark in them that makes them what they are. Good games only happen when people ignore the marketing department and make something they think is cool, and I'm going to keep doing that. If you have really cool idea, but suddenly you need millions of people to like it, you end up with Spore, a potentially great game that got more and more dumbed down.</p>",

  "<p>India's nuclear authorities have admitted radioactive scrap was exported from the country to make lift buttons in France.<br> French firm Mafelec sent thousands of lift buttons to the elevator maker Otis, which put them in hundreds of lifts in the country over the summer. Otis said it removed the buttons after France's nuclear safety authority (ASN) announced this week that 20 workers who handled them were exposed to doses of radioactivity ranging from 1 to 3 millisievert (mSv). The French legal limit for people who do not work in the nuclear industry is 1mSv per year.</p> <p>The ASN said it had classified the incident at Mafelec as level two on the international nuclear event scale. The scale goes from zero, which means no safety risk, to seven, which means a major accident.<br> The safety agency said the buttons contained traces of radioactive cobalt-60. Four Indian firms made the components, an Indian official said. It was unclear where the contaminated scrap originated \u2013 although metal was traced to a foundry in the western state of Maharashtra. Malafec bought the buttons from two Indian companies that got their raw materials from another company, SKM Steels. In turn, it was supplied by the Vipris foundry near Khopoli on the way to Pune from Mumbai. \"We are tracking back the whole chain,\" said Satya Pal Agarwal, the head of the radiological safety division of India's atomic energy regulator.</p> <p>Indian foundries are not required to install radiation detectors to check scrap, but the government has a programme to put radiation monitors at ports to check cargo.</p>",
  "<p>Phil Woolas, the immigration minister, said today that he stuck by his controversial promise that the government would not allow the UK's population to rise as high as 70 million.</p> <p>But Woolas denied that this amounted to a \"numerical cap\" on immigration, saying that it was a reassurance to the public that the government's new points-based system would ensure that the upward trend in population would be kept under control.</p> <p>The new minister, who has hit the headlines several times for alleged gaffes since being appointed to his current job in this month's reshuffle, denied he had been \"gagged\" after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/24/jacqui-smith-bbc-woolas\">withdrawing at the last minute from last night's Question Time</a> on BBC1.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his withdrawal was due to a government decision that it would be better to have a minister with economic responsibilities on the show, adding: \"I have just read that I've been gagged for two weeks, and yet here I am on your programme.\"</p> <p>Woolas said that there had been a series of predictions that on current trends the UK population was heading towards 70 million or more, from official statisticians, the European Union and the new cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration headed by MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames.</p> <p>But he said that the \"tough\" new points-based system coming into effect next month, which will allocate work permits according to whether applicants have skills needed by the UK economy, will respond to these concerns - even though it will not affect migration from the EU, whose nationals have the right to work in Britain.</p> <p>Woolas said: \"We are introducing the biggest shake-up in immigration policy for 45 years ... that is based on a points system which allows the government to move the hurdles up and down - the criteria by which people can come into our country to work.</p> <p>\"That will allow us to control the population, to answer the worries that Frank Field and Nicholas Soames have been raising. That is not the same as a numerical cap. We don't think that's appropriate.\"</p> <p>Asked if he stood by his assurance that the government would not let the population rise from its current 61 million to 70 million or more, Woolas replied: \"Yes. There are projections from our own statistics office and from Europe and some MPs that show the population as increasing towards that sort of level.</p> <p>\"My point is that the points-based system we are introducing allows governments to influence the numbers of people coming into the country to work, and there are other changes we are making.</p> <p>\"I am trying to reassure the people who are worried about speculation about increased population that they don't have to worry. The figure of 70 million is not a figure of my choosing, it is a figure speculated by others.\"</p> <p>But he acknowledged: \"What you can't factor in is how many people leave the country and you can't figure in movement from Europe. That's why you can't put a precise figure on it, but we can reassure the public that the general trend will be controlled.\"</p>",

  "<p>In less than three months, the mandate of the president of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Mahmoud Abbas, legally ends. With the Palestinian Legislative Council frozen since 2006 and the administrations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salam_Fayyad\">Salam Fayyad</a> in the West Bank and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh\">Ismail Haniyeh</a> in Gaza both lacking democratic legitimacy, his is the last elected position in the PNA. </p> <p>Without a new ballot before January 9, 2009, Palestinians risk being left without legitimate governing structures, and the international community will not have a partner to continue the hollow \"peace process\". While the international community and Israel have had a major stake in undermining Palestinian democratic institutions, the question remains: what next for the Palestinian people? In fact, this breakdown may provide an important opening for new popular forces to rise within Palestinian national politics. </p> <p>To salvage what remains of Palestinian institutions, Egypt is attempting to broker an agreement between Fatah and Hamas. However, the first draft of a possible agreement reflects competing factional interests that render the talks fragile at best. Abbas's mandate topped the preliminary negotiations. Hamas had insisted on the illegality of an extension of his mandate, yet it seemingly backed down in front of Fatah's intransigency. </p> <p>Neither player in the West Bank PNA is in a position to run an election campaign now. Abbas, with a divided Fatah might lose the ballot, and if Fayyad is planning a candidacy, he still needs time to prepare. Realistically, it seems pointless to stage elections risking a Palestinian vote for a Hamas representative who does not please Israeli and western interests and would be brought down via sanctions and isolation. </p> <p>Hamas' concession for Abbas to keep his position beyond the electoral mandate only underscores the fact that the PNA is on the verge of institutional breakdown. Politically, Abbas is caught between the returns that Hamas will demand and the divisions within Fatah. An old guard of Fatah officials are gathering around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Qurei\">Ahmad Qureia</a>, the chief negotiator of the PNA, calling for the Fayyad government to step down. Their main interest in Cairo is the construction of a new \"consensus government\" to shore up the power of the dominant parties and sideline Fayyad and his \"technocrats\". The old guard feel threatened by what they see as Fayyad's attempt to split Fatah or to wrest control from its traditional leadership. </p> <p>Fayyad is well placed to succeed in this mission. His leverage on the PNA's funding allows him to ensure that Fatah cadres, regional governors and other position holders depend partially on him for salaries and benefits. Further, the current reform of the Palestinian \"security sector\" eliminates much of the historical military leadership that arose in the diaspora during the 1970s and 1980s and which remains imbued with national values. Instead, new recruits <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGIPMV3N61.DTL&amp;type=printable\">trained by the CIA</a> are taught a different line. As the Palestinian interior minister reportedly stated: \"You are not here to confront Israel, the conflict of Israel has until now led nowhere. You must show the Israelis that you can do the job.\" </p> <p>This is not the way to gain Palestinian popular support. Even after his almost daily visits to towns across the West Bank during this summer, US prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fayyad holds no more sway with the people than does Qureia, whose name is still linked with the company that <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article2843.shtml\">provided cement</a> for the Wall. </p> <p>An alliance of Palestinian leftist parties, so far uninvolved in the power play around the PNA, would probably garner popular support by giving priority to the needs of the people and the principles of the Palestinian struggle. Yet they have so far been unable to concretely unite against the politics of factional interests. Until then, they will remain marginal in the national discussions.</p> <p>Amid the political haggling by leaders without a national vision, the Cairo talks will hardly go beyond the current draft agreement. This might avert an open confrontation between Fatah and Hamas, but it keeps the president's mandate legally questionable and politically unviable. Essentially, it produces committees which will discuss issues considered crucial to the factional interests but with little prospect of reaching conclusions. </p> <p>In this context, the PLO could be a fallback option. Though the revival of the organisation is on the Cairo agenda, recent efforts do not bode well. The latest attempt, led by Abed Rabbo (the PLO's chair) and Fayyad, was based solely on participation from the West Bank. According to their plans, the PLO would start receiving funds through the PNA, effectively putting the PNA into a dominant position. This would cripple the only Palestinian body representing Palestinians across historic Palestine and in the diaspora, abandoning all to a paralysed PNA. </p> <p>For the international community, the impending demise of legitimate and viable Palestinian structures of representation signals the end of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Mideast_peace_conference\">Annapolis process</a>. With the US administration in election mode and the Israeli prime minister yet to form her cabinet, it seems unrealistic that the promoters of Annapolis will succeed in coercing Palestinians before the end of Abbas's mandate into signing an agreement that reflects Israeli expectations and as a result will not stop the colonisation, fragmentation and isolation of the West Bank and Gaza. Abbas is not Arafat, who enjoyed trust and respect even without elections because of his role in the struggle and his charisma. Any new US or Israeli administration will lack a Palestinian partner with the legal authority or popular backing to sign such an agreement. </p> <p>For once, it seems time is on the side of the Palestinians, opening up the opportunity to reorder the ranks and define alternatives to the current political setting. A popular force created to shoulder the national responsibilities could build upon the large majority of Palestinians who have been alienated by the current party politics but are not willing to surrender their struggle. It can create national unity by focusing on the one thing missing from the Cairo talks: the struggle against the occupation and Israel's apartheid system of checkpoints, the Wall and settlements. This can lead out of the current political crisis, regenerate the Palestinian struggle, and create a viable national movement.</p>",
  "<p>As I've written about before, in addition to the elections this year, voters are being asked to decide several ballot initiatives across several states. In Colorado, voters are being asked to decide whether to amend the state constitution to read \"the terms 'person' or 'persons' shall include any human being from the moment of fertilization\". Conservatives say that it's a <a href=\"http://www.lifesitenews.com/ldn/2008/may/08053007.html\">historic opportunity in Colorado to overturn Roe v Wade</a>, the US Supreme Court decision legalising abortion. Liberals are mocking Amendment 48, calling it the \"egg-mendment\".</p> <p>In the past, such controversial ballot initiatives have rallied social conservatives, but due to the broad nature of this amendment, Democrats say it's helping to motivate their supporters. Analysts also say that it draws attention to Sarah Palin's extreme views on abortion and alienates moderate women.</p> <p>Opponents have said that the \"moment of fertilisation\" is not a <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=5736\">medically recognised term and almost impossible to determine</a> outside of a lab. Opponents also say that it could force the state to investigate miscarriages and to limit birth-control methods. Blogger Zappatero at the PeakDemsBlog had this <a href=\"http://blog.peakdems.org/2008/05/q-and-eggmendment.html\">tongue-and-cheek question-and-answer on the amendment</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>When do we start having women register their periods with the government every month so we can track and investigate miscarriages?</strong> I'm sure our police forces will consider staking out the feminine hygiene aisle down at Walgreen's to be a far more important task than staking out, say, crack houses.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Economist looked at ballot initiatives in several states and said while it found that some such as California's ballot initiative to ban gay marriage would rally conservatives, they believed that this amendment in Colorado would actually <a href=\"http://www.theelectroniceconomist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12263114\">rally Democrats and moderate women</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>The \"egg-mendment\", as critics dub it, is likely to mobilise moderate women voters in opposition while drawing attention to John McCain's and Sarah Palin's strict views on abortion\u2014and this in a swing state. In November it will almost certainly go down in flames.</p> </blockquote> <p>I asked the bloggers at Democrat community site <a href=\"http://squarestate.net\">Squarestate.net</a> whether they thought the amendment would rally conservatives or liberals, something which could affect the presidential result in the state.</p> <p>One <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showComment.do?commentId=35638\">blogger said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think the egg-mendment, along with the selection of the rabidly anti-abortion Palin, has a whole lot of independent Coloradan convinced they need to get to the polls this year, as if there wasn't enough reason already.</p> <p>I know several middle-of-the-road women who were undecided until the selection of Palin. As a wedge issue, it seems the abortion debate has started backfiring on the GOP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/userDiary.do?personId=944\">blogger on Squarestate.net said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br> The R(epublican)s that were heading to the polls to vote for this were either already on their way to vote for McCain, or cast a third-party vote because he isn't pro-life enough.</p> <p>On the other hand, this amendment will help to boost bringing out progressives who are passionate about women's rights but don't see that issue represented in the other initiatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showComment.do?commentId=35642\">another blogger on the site added</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>If you get too broad, as South Dakota did with a similar measure, you start alienating even moderate Republicans. This measure separates alienates people who are merely anti-abortion but are not anti-birth control.</p> <p>Dems, of course, can now talk seriously about the need to take action to fight Amendment 48, and mobolize with it.</p> <p>Honestly, though, turnout in this election is being driven by the top of the ticket. Obama is bringing people into the process who have never participated before, and that is a big piece of why he won in the primary and caucus fight.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Despite being Catholic and opposing abortion, <a href=\"http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/amendment-48\">Democratic Governor Bill Ritter has come out against the amendment</a> saying it would put the state between a woman and her doctor, and there has been a well organised \"<a href=\"http://www.protectfamiliesprotectchoices.org/\">No on 48</a>\" campaign. <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/state_toplines/colorado/toplines_colorado_presidential_election_september_28_2008\">A poll in late September</a> found that 50% opposed to the amendment, 39% for it and 11% unsure.</p>",
  "<p>What we're finding on this trip is that Sarah Palin is an extremely polarising figure. She thrills <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94194824\">socially conservative Republicans</a> while <a href=\"http://webweaversworld.blogspot.com/2008/10/republicans-for-obama-in-their-own.html\">alienating moderate Republicans</a> and enraging Democrats, and we saw that during our trip through Colorado.</p> <p>John McCain wasn't social conservatives' first choice of candidate, but they cheered his choice of Sarah Palin. In an interview this week, Palin told Colorado Springs-based evangelical leader and broadcaster James Dobson that <a href=\"http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2008/10/22/hardcore-prolifer-palin-dobsons-podcast\">God \"would do the right thing\" on election day.</a> <a href=\"http://divasblueoasis.com/showDiary.do;jsessionid=11EA499CB0C164E23F0EFCCA138D158A?diaryId=219\">Blogger Celtic Diva writes:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Palin is herself a transformational figure: She is transforming an increasingly narrow band of Americans into a political lynch mob. Only her supporters are pro-American, only her supporters are hard-working and only her supporters serve our country in uniform. Now we can add this: only Palin's God is the real God and only a McPalin victory could be the Will of God.</p> </blockquote> <p>Colorado bloggers have joined Democrats across the country in calling for Sarah Palin to be made more available to the press to answer questions. A sentiment echoed by CNN's Campbell Brown who has launched a \"<a href=\"http://squarestate.net/showDiary.do?diaryId=6718\">Free Sarah Palin</a>\" campaign.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tLlXxMY2LHI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/tLlXxMY2LHI&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/tLlXxMY2LHI&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>Democratic bloggers in Colorado also took Palin to task for her opposition of a ballot measure that would increase the state sales tax to pay for <a href=\"http://www.9news.com/news/elections/article.aspx?storyid=102301&amp;catid=13\">services for the developmentally disabled</a>. <a href=\"http://thecurvature.com/2008/10/23/palin-not-such-an-advocate-for-people-with-disabilities-after-all/\">They accuse her of hypocrisy</a> because her infant son has Down's syndrome.</p> <p>Nationally, Democrats have criticised her for accusing Barack Obama of \"palling around with terrorists\", which some Democrats have believe has led to <a href=\"http://alysah-98.newsvine.com/_news/2008/10/06/1962009-palin-rally-incites-attendee-to-shout-kill-him-death-threat-to-obama?commentId=3365282\">threats against Obama during McCain-Palin rallies</a>. But conservatives have rallied to Palin's defence, and point to <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/richardminiter/2008/10/23/the-press-v-palin/\">hatred of Palin in the press</a> and among Democratic supporters such as these <a href=\"http://www.uncorrelated.com/2008/10/who_are_the_real_haters.html\">protesters in Colorado</a>.

A veteran Republican I spoke to in New Mexico said that her choice <a href=\"http://lettersfromatory.wordpress.com/2008/10/23/palin-has-probably-robbed-mccain-of-the-presidency/\">undermined John McCain's message of experience</a>, which had been the central argument of his campaign all summer. </p> <p>The press now says that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/22/AR2008102203346.html?nav=rss_politics/elections\">McCain is fighting a \"Palin backlash\"</a>, and some analysts saw <a href=\"http://donklephant.com/2008/10/22/the-mccainpalin-nbc-interview/\">tension between McCain and Palin</a> during an interview this week. </p> <p>We're moving on from Colorado now.

  "<p>New strip, October 2008. Click to enlarge.</p> <p><strong>Keith Hackett's official answers:</strong><br><strong>1) </strong>The home captain is right: you must change. You shouldn't have let it get this far. Before Premier League and Football League games the manager and the captain of both teams meet you in your dressing room. One of your tasks is to make sure there are no colour clashes: the law requires that all players wear colours that distinguish them from the officials. So you inspect the home and away outfield and goalkeeping strips, plus the tops that the subs will be wearing on the touchline, and decide whether to wear black, yellow or green. It's an important decision, which is sometimes rushed, so I have reminded referees to be aware of it. With the huge range of goalkeeping strips now in use, I'm also considering introducing a fourth coloured shirt for our officials. <br><em>Thanks to John Caley for the question.</em> <br><strong>2)</strong> Send the player off. He is guilty of violent conduct. After the game the player could ask for a personal hearing, claiming he did not realise what he was doing. With any head injury you must act quickly: signal for the medics to come on immediately (including, if necessary, the duty doctor and paramedics) and, where possible, keep other players away. In this situation, if you'd been able to keep other players back, the injured party would have had no-one to hit. <br><em>Thanks to Chris Kempshall for the question.</em><br><strong>3)</strong> No. The substitution is complete once you have given your permission, the player has left and the sub has come on. But you must still take disciplinary action. As well as giving the departed player his second yellow card you should also consider giving the incoming sub a yellow card for delaying the restart. But it would have been better to be proactive: when you stop play for a substitution you must stop your watch, and make that clear to players. So this player's tactics are achieving little other than winding people up. <br><em>Henning Furbach wins the shirt for this question. </em></p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.
