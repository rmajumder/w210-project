  "<p><strong>DK</strong> Before I discovered that the Spanish was the proper answer to 1 e4 e5, I was, true to my name, a supporter of the King's Gambit \u2014 2 f4 exf4, and now 3 Nf3 is the main starting position. However, for a time I dabbled with a bizarre off shoot, 3 Nc3, sometimes named after the 19th-century Irish-American player James Mason (though he seems to have played it just once and lost), sometimes after Paul Keres (though he was once checkmated with it in just 12 moves ). </p> <p>3\u2026 Qh4+ is obvious and good. White is forced to play 4 Ke2, blocking his king's bishop, and, crucially, losing the right to castle. However, there's method in this madness. White will gain time against the queen on the next turn by playing Nf3, and can build a strong centre with d4. To refute White's idea Black must play with energy and some accuracy. The outrageousness of this gambit appealed to the King family, but I ditched it when my opponents got too strong. My brother, nowadays an occasional but enthusiastic online player, has continued playing the opening, apparently with some success. His opponents often cop out of the queen check and play 3\u2026 g5, appropriate with a knight on f3, but here disastrous. 4 h4! breaks up the kingside pawns and leaves White, after moves such as d4, Bxf4 and Bc4, with a beautiful attacking position. It's a classic case of how an unusual opening can throw stereotyped players.</p> <p>In serious competition, the gambit has always had mixed results \u2014 to put it kindly \u2014 but as a surprise weapon it has claimed some calps. The player of the black pieces in this encounter is International Master strength and is about to get mated spectacularly. White sacrifi ced his second rook with 1 Be2! Qxh1 2 Bg4+ f5 3 Bxf5+ Kc7 4 Qa7+ Kd8 5 Qxb8+ Ke7 6 Qxd6+ Kf7 7 Qe6+ Kg7 8 Be5+, and mate follows shortly.</p> <p>This concludes our gambit series \u2014 for the time being. Feedback has been so enthusiastic that we will no doubt revisit the theme .</p>",
  "<p>The Australian government has approved the Chinese acquisition of a stake in the mining group Rio Tinto, potentially throwing an obstacle in the path of BHP Billiton's \u00a370bn bid for the company. </p> <p>Chinalco, in partnership with the American mining group Alcoa, spent \u00a37bn to become Rio Tinto's largest shareholder in February. The acquisition of 12% of Rio Tinto's London shares was the biggest single foreign investment made by a Chinese company to date and had to overcome serious political concerns in Canberra.</p> <p>In a statement released yesterday the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, said he would allow the Chinese company to buy as much as 14.99% of Rio Tinto's London shares. Rio Tinto has a dual listing in Sydney and a 14.99% stake in London would equate to around 11% in the entire group.</p> <p>But he set two conditions; that Chinalco does not raise its stake above that level without fresh approval from the Australian government and that it will not seek to appoint a director to the Rio Tinto board as long as its stake remains below 15%. </p> <p>It is debatable whether Chinalco will feel bound by the conditions. In an interview in June, Chinalco president Xiao Yaqing suggested that the company did not need Canberra's approval because it had bought the shares in London.</p> <p>Chinalco's swoop on Rio Tinto was widely regarded as an attempt to block the BHP bid rather than a precursor to its own takeover attempt. Beijing is said to fear that a merger of BHP and Rio Tinto would spark an increase in the price of raw materials. A combined BHP and Rio Tinto would be worth \u00a3170bn and control about 35% of the world's traded iron ore.</p> <p>BHP Billiton chief executive Marius Kloppers has played down the significance of the Chinese stake in Rio Tinto. BHP made its hostile all-share offer conditional on only 50% acceptances, which means it is not necessarily reliant on the support of Chinalco. But Stephen Bartrop, a resources analyst at Stock Resource in Sydney, told Bloomberg that the Chinese stake in Rio Tinto \"creates uncertainty about whether or not BHP will get its deal over the line\".</p> <p>The west has been wary about the growing financial clout of China, with governments scrutinising deals for political intent. In the United States, a Chinese company was allowed to take over the personal computer business of IBM, but another, CNOOC, was blocked from buying oil company Unocal. The Australian government recently blocked the Chinese steelmaker Shougang from buying a 20% stake in Perth-based iron ore producer Mount Gibson. A Chinese bid for the Canadian aluminium group Noranda was also scuppered by political objections.</p> <p>Swan said the conditions imposed upon Chinalco would be sufficient to protect Australia's national interests.</p> <p>BHP is awaiting regulatory approval before sending out its offer document. Washington has already given its approval while Europe is expected to rule by December 9. Australian regulators will give their final verdict in October.</p>",

Incredulity has replaced the initial jolt of shock as the details of the \u00a37.5m restructuring programme fall into place. Fancy flow charts and salary scales and a table of job changes all hang a noose around 70 newsroom roles. </p> <p>Reporters, sorry, Multimedia Journalists (MMJs), are already struggling with bulging workloads. Their new role (should they get one) will include taking photographs, shooting video and writing directly to web pages - with a case of defamation just waiting to be tossed at the MMJ and their editor. These new \"multi-skilled\" journalists spell job losses for 15 members of the papers-wide photographic team, as 39 roles turn into 24, with the shortfall of images being made up by reporters and hi-tech mobile phones. </p> <p>At least the snappers, or MMIJs, can gaze across the newsroom and take pity on the subs. Twenty will be disposed of - and those that have the privilege of keeping their jobs are to be unceremoniously booted off to Brum to a centralised production office. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror invested more than \u00a360m in the Fort - a colour press facility on the outskirts of the city. Unfortunately, it is in the shadow of one of the busiest sections of motorway outside the M25 - the dreaded stretch where the M6 meets the M42 meets the Birmingham snarl-up meets motorist misery. The thought of the commute alone is making subs reach for the redundancy package. </p> <p>A strong sports desk in Coventry, helped by a good local sporting culture, is being stripped down to bare kit, with an emphasis on a centralised sports desk - because readers in Coventry will really care how Birmingham City FC got on at the weekend. And for reporters, the scramble for jobs could be desperate. Ten positions will be lost in Birmingham, three in Coventry and three across the weeklies. Four pages of \"user-generated\" content will be introduced in the Coventry Telegraph when the changes sweep in - an early indication of the surviving MMJs being replaced by Bob Jones of Hillfields et al. </p> <p>The new jobs will have higher salaries - weekly MMJs in particular are looking at a decent rise (\u00a319,413.69 for the most skilled compared with around \u00a316,000 now). Even the least skilled daily reporter, according to a confusing grading system, will be earning \u00a323,472.67 - a rise of \u00a31,000 or so. But given that journalists are already working hard, nobody can work out how they will take on the extra tasks these new roles will bring, as well as manage a news diary that looks like a TV listings page. </p> <p>Senior management need not apply for new jobs: they've been ushered in the back door. But here in Coventry - and at our branch office in Nuneaton (two others in Warwickshire have closed in recent years) - the future is less certain. Confusion and tension reign in the newsroom.</p> <p>Shiny new job titles won't make these cuts any less of a demoralising blow for local journalism. And Trinity Mirror's really cruel twist? The back page of the consultation document, which details all these job losses, is also doubling as a job application form. </p> <p>The writer is a journalist for Trinity Mirror</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another death list. Despite having an arsenal of anti-press laws at his disposal, the leader of Zimbabwe's junta, Robert Mugabe, has resorted to using brute force and the threat of assassination to silence the independent media. Yet another list, prepared by Mugabe's Central Intelligence Organisation, is doing the rounds of internet websites. I take a cursory look at the list, and yawn. The same old names are there - all the stalwarts of our profession who endeavour constantly to bring to the world's attention the appalling atrocities being committed in the name of sovereignty by the Mugabe regime. </p> <p>Nobody on those lists panics - we've seen and heard it all before. Mugabe's dirty tricks department has been circulating similar ones since 2000. We know this is just another hazard of working as a Zimbabwean journalist - our so-called president wants to kill us.</p> <p>Since his power began to wane in the late 1990s, Mugabe has seen the independent media as his enemy. In 1999, the establishment of the country's first independent national daily, the Daily News, rattled his cage. He ordered the arrest and torture of the journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto. Both were eventually released. </p> <p>Then Mugabe lost the 2000 constitutional referendum and faced the spectre of electoral defeat at that year's general elections by the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The battle lines were drawn. He unleashed an onslaught against the media that has worsened with each passing year. </p> <p><strong>Harassment</strong></p> <p>In 2003, the misnamed Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) made it mandatory for all journalists and media organisations operating inside the country to be registered - policed - by the Media and Information Commission. Headed by a Mugabe apologist, Tafataona Mahoso, the MIC holds the dubious honour of having closed down five independent newspapers, including the Daily News and its sister, the Daily News on Sunday, in its first two years. </p> <p>During Mahoso's reign, countless journalists have been harassed, arrested, beaten, tortured and locked up, among them Gift Phiri, chief reporter for the independent weekly the Zimbabwean, who was tortured and had a finger broken. A cameraman has been killed. More reporters have been arrested in the past five years than during the first two decades of independence. In all these cases, there has not been a single conviction. </p> <p>But this year's general and presidential election, which Mugabe lost to the MDC and Morgan Tsvangirai, made the previous decade's media repression look like a grandmothers' tea party. The state-controlled media went into overdrive - its ham-fisted spin and sickeningly blatant deception would have been laughable had it not been so tragic. </p> <p>The 2003 act was used to control media coverage of the elections. Exorbitant registration fees were charged and only a handful of foreign correspondents accredited. Major media groups such as the Associated Press, South Africa's e.tv, the US broadcasters CNN and MSNBC, and the BBC were all blocked from receiving accreditation. </p> <p>Lined up against Mugabe was a small array of independent voices - local weeklies the Independent, Financial Gazette and Sunday Standard (producing fewer than 30,000 copies a week between them), the London-based SW Radio Africa, South Africa-based Voice of the People and the US-based Voice of America's Studio 7. The Zimbabwean, a serious independent weekly tabloid, had joined them in early 2005. Exploiting a loophole in AIPPA, the Zimbabwean is published outside the country and trucked in from South Africa. </p> <p>The Zimbabwean soon became the largest-selling newspaper in the country, its circulation increasing from 20,000 copies a week to more than 100,000 during 2007. In the weeks leading up to the March 2008 elections and during their aftermath, circulation increased further to 200,000 a week and the Zimbabwean on Sunday was added to the stable.</p> <p>Distribution of this title peaked at 100,000 before the truck carrying 60,000 copies of the Africa Day (May 25) issue was torched by eight plainclothes goons brandishing new AK-47 rifles, with which they beat the driver and his assistant before firing rounds into the petrol-soaked newspaper truck to set it alight. A few days previously, Mugabe's election agent, Emmerson Mnangagwa, had publicly blamed the Zimbabwean and other \"foreign media\" for Mugabe's humiliation at the polls.</p> <p>We managed to continue getting the newspapers into the country, using a hired South African trucker, some brave drivers and various routes, and on one occasion sending 40,000 copies in by air freight. But the Mugabe regime had a nifty solution up its sleeve. Punitive duties amounting to 70% of the invoice value of the papers were announced in late May. The first issue to arrive at Beitbridge border post in June was slapped with the new duty - \u00a35,000 for 100,000 copies. </p> <p>We reeled at the audacity and fulminated at the injustice of it. We slashed the print run for the Thursday edition to 60,000 and scraped together all our resources to get another three issues of the Sunday edition published and into the country. But we could not go on. We suspended publication of the Zimbabwean on Sunday after the issue of June 22 this year. We have managed to secure funding to get 60,000 copies of the Zimbabwean into the country each week for a short period. After that, who knows? </p> <p><strong>International response</strong></p> <p>Several international organisations, including the World Association of Newspapers, have responded to our plea to condemn the duty and demand its removal. WAN and the World Association of Editors have written to Mugabe to protest. Needless to say, they have had no response. In the meantime, the reign of terror back home continues. Thanks to modern technology and brave MDC and civil society activists, the international media receive a steady flow of information and pictures illustrating the junta's bloody reign of terror. The few remaining journalists inside the country play hide-and-seek with the police and do not sleep at home. Many have left for safer climes. </p> <p>But back to the latest death threat. My eye is caught by a final paragraph: \"The majority of those named on the list, although they are living in the bliss and security of the Diaspora and the anonymity of cyberspace, their family members will not be so lucky.\" It's a chilling development. They are now threatening to harm our families. And we know this is no idle threat. Despite, for centuries, the family being sacrosanct in Zimbabwean culture and never before threatened, horror has gone to new heights in recent weeks. This flies in the face of everything decent. The unthinkable has become reality. </p> <p>I and my fellow journalists have chosen to take up the weapon of words against Mugabe's guns. We are prepared to face the repercussions of our actions. Some have already paid the ultimate sacrifice. But not my children. A line must be drawn somewhere, and very soon. </p> <p>\u00b7 Wilf Mbanga is the founder and publisher of the Zimbabwean, the largest-circulation newspaper inside Zimbabwe today.

  "<p>Your story detailing the level of incentives paid by big drug companies to medical professionals exposes what appears to be attempt by these companies to buy favours (Drug giants accused over doctors' perks, August 23). This widespread activity seems to go beyond what is normally understood a \"perk\" given for some minor service rendered. We give these professionals our trust; they know best, we assume, and advise us on what medicines we need to take to maintain our health. How can this trust be maintained in the face of such practices? The companies themselves already make enormous profits from prices for drugs; they realise that spending a few thousands on sending doctors on foreign trips is worth it. </p> <p>The government should, as a matter of urgency, introduce legislation to regulate the acceptance of such \"perks\".<br><strong>John Green</strong><br>London</p> <p>If pharmaceutical companies think they are promoting medical education rather than engaging in \"highly effective, well-targeted marketing\", and the doctors would like a pot of money to fund their travel, what is stopping the establishment of a central fund in which drug companies pool their altruistic contributions and to which doctors can apply for sponsorship?</p> <p>We hear that GPs claim back from the NHS a standard price for each drug prescribed, whatever they have actually paid for it, while the drug company deliberately bills them for a sum below this figure.

  "<p>It was the TV festival equivalent of an all-singing, all-dancing Saturday-night shiny floor show. The feelgood vibes rolled across the packed, hard wooden pews of Edinburgh's McEwan Hall as Peter Fincham delivered one of the best-received MacTaggart speeches of recent years. The industry may not have been breaking open the bubbly, but the atmosphere in the packed hall was closer to a party than it has been after the sermons of recent years.</p> <p>The morning after, the hangovers kicked in. The ITV director of television's address was a rousing celebration of all that was good about British telly - but he had refused to grapple with the detail of how his vision for a popular, strong, diverse ITV would actually be delivered. The closer you looked, the more holes appeared in his argument - 24 hours later, there seemed a growing disconnect between Fincham's elegantly expressed vision and the sense that huge, unanswered problems continue to stalk ITV.</p> <p>Fincham painted an optimistic picture of free-to-air, mass-market television's future if only regulatory help was forthcoming to help ITV get there. But in reality the double whammy of structural change and what Channel 4's chairman, Luke Johnson, said was the worst year for the British economy in 20 years leave it in a desperately exposed state. ITV's dismal recent results - revealing that ad revenues for next month are down by a fifth year on year, as its share price continues to hit new lows - exposed the scale of the problem. </p> <p>Fincham's pitch was similar to that delivered by his boss, Michael Grade, albeit more entertaining. Indeed, in Edinburgh it was left to other ITV execs - such as Grade's blunt commercial chief, Rupert Howell - to add some detail. In essence, ITV wants to retain the privileges of being a public service broadcaster - being No 3 on the remote control, for a start - while divesting itself of many of its historic obligations, including commitments to regional news and current affairs. </p> <p><strong>Besuited wonks</strong></p> <p>Fincham described a British-owned broadcaster delivering everything from news to arts, with \u00a31m-an-hour drama at its heart. In return for maintaining its investment in programmes at around its current level, ITV should be handed a far less restrictive settlement. Such a channel deserves celebrating, he argued, rather than castigating. </p> <p>Like all great entertainers, Fincham played to the gallery. His caricature of regulators as wordy, besuited wonks who rarely spend Saturday nights slumped in front of The X Factor was warmly embraced by an audience of programme-makers who increasingly resent what they perceive as a snobbish distrust of popular television among the political and regulatory classes.</p> <p>\"Television needs regulators, just as roads need traffic wardens. But you wouldn't ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy, still less how to drive it,\" Fincham said to laughter. Criticising the regulator in front of broadcasters is rather like a comedian telling jokes about Liverpool fans in a Manchester pub.</p> <p>Ofcom insiders were bemused by the attack. They felt Fincham quoted selectively from the report. Indeed, in much of its recent output, Ofcom has already bought into ITV's argument that the new digital landscape made its historic public service commitments impossible to maintain. The \"storyline\" document leaked to MediaGuardian last month suggests that the regulator will give ITV significant leeway in the second phase of its public service broadcasting review next month. Ofcom has confirmed that the value of ITV's public service licence will decline from \u00a3280m to \u00a345m by 2012 and that it was minded to reduce ITV's commitments as digital switchover neared.</p> <p>Tim Gardam, the former Channel 4 director of programmes who is now an Ofcom director, refused to be drawn into a slanging match on an Edinburgh podium. He even said that Fincham was simply echoing Ofcom's position, though in slightly different language, and suggested that if Fincham had \"read half a centimetre further along\" the ITV executive would have found much common ground. Gardam echoed many in the industry when he said: \"But what exactly is he [Fincham] asking Ofcom to do?\"</p> <p>In his speech, Fincham channelled the spirit of Lew Grade and Sidney Bernstein, the great showmen of ITV's past, and in that he succeeded. \"He gave a beautiful, amusingly delivered speech, as you would expect. Just slightly short of substance,\" said Charles Brand, director of specialist factual at Tiger Aspect. Mark Wood, the ITN chief executive, called it \"uplifting\", while pointing out the hard reality that ITV is restructuring its regional newsgathering network in a bid to slash \u00a340m from its budget this autumn. </p> <p><strong>Grimmer picture</strong></p> <p>In other vulnerable areas too, particularly children's programming, the evidence onscreen suggests a much grimmer picture than that suggested by Fincham. John Whittingdale, the Tory MP who chairs the media select committee, said: \"I do accept ITV is facing significant economic pressure. But Ofcom doesn't need to talk about entertainment because there is no requirement for government intervention to get Britain's Got Talent on to our screens. There is a serious problem in children's television and regional news, which ITV exemplifies because it's pulling out of them left, right and centre.\"</p> <p>Despite Fincham's championing of creativity, there is a genuine sense of frustration within the walls of ITV's Grays Inn Road HQ that onscreen improvements seem to be making little impact. Added to the gloom, efficiency savings have reached the engine room of the advertising sales staff, and the marketing and PR operations have been severely cut. ITV executives point to efficiencies, stabilised viewing figures and a slight uplift in the number of people watching ads. Now they want policy-makers and regulators to offer a helping hand. </p> <p>Melvyn Bragg, the doyen of ITV programme-makers, picked up the baton from Fincham: \"The old game is up, it's all over. We are chained to an ancient regime, which is unsustainable. The \u00a31bn in programming money - that's the prize ITV is fighting for. This is about the survival of the most adaptable, but we're in a straitjacket.\"</p> <p>ITV's list of demands includes reformation of the contract rights renewal system that pegs the rates it can charge for ads to pre-merger levels, which Howell claims would bring in an extra \u00a340m a year. It wants to be free to charge what it likes, in more slots, and enjoy the freedom to operate without any regulatory constraints. It also wants restrictions on how it spends its programme budget - those regulations that commit it to spending half of its money outside London and restrict its rights negotiations with independent producers - swept away. But David Liddiment, the former ITV director of programmes who is now a BBC Trustee, accused Fincham of \"tilting at windmills\". \"I don't see any evidence of Ofcom trying to turn ITV into Radio 4,\" he added. </p> <p>Even Fincham welcomed the fact that ITV was in the \"centre of the conversation\" this year, at a time when the whole industry is having to come to terms with the realities of the fragmented media landscape. The Channel 4 chief executive, Andy Duncan, summed it up when he said: \"The changes are very profound. Television is not as important as it was in people's lives. There are global forces at work.\" </p> <p>ITV believes it has long been the industry \"whipping boy\", in Bragg's words. Yet what has hurt most over the past few years is that viewers are not tuning in in significantly mass-market numbers. For all Fincham's rousing words about the communal power of ITV hits such as The X Factor, Britain's Got Talent and Champions League football, he said rather less about some of its more disappointing fare. ITV1 hasn't had a new contemporary 9pm drama hit all year, for example, verging on self-parody with the tacky Rock Rivals and superficially glitzy Harley Street. It has also been a miserable summer for the network, almost visibly giving up in the face of the BBC's Olympics onslaught. Many believe that the schedule will improve this autumn. Yet such is the structural malaise in which ITV finds itself that even an improvement of its onscreen fortunes would not help in the short term.</p> <p>Fincham was also at a loss to explain what would happen if an overseas raider came and bought ITV. The current management team have promised to invest in a high-quality mixed schedule in return for fewer regulations, but a new management team may not share their view. </p> <p>As Fincham delivered his speech, the gathered executives felt the warming comfort of television's ability to hold mass audiences in its spell. The theme was \"I love TV\" and Fincham managed to put an \"I\" in front of the TV part. The assembled stars in Edinburgh and Fincham's speech had reminded them of television's peculiar power. As the feelgood factor visibly drained away amid hard questioning over the weekend, however, there was a tangible fear among broadcasters that events are on the verge of overtaking them as regulatory reform continues at a glacial pace and the media landscape is redrawn. </p> <p>ITV will get an answer before the end of the year on its regional plans, but decisions on the future funding of public service broadcasting and the other changes it is lobbying for are likely to take much longer. Duncan's rallying call for broadcasters to stop bickering and lobby government for urgent help looks likely to fall on deaf ears. And with any significant changes to the statute book unlikely to be on the agenda until after a general election, they know that time is running out.</p>",
  "<p>It took Jimmy Page and David Beckham just eight minutes to set the tone for London 2012 last night, but four years of hard work and unremitting focus will be required to deliver on the vision of a contemporary, inclusive and human games that arrived in the Bird's Nest aboard a double-decker bus last night.</p> <p>The challenge facing London remains huge, not least because of the technically flawless event delivered by the Chinese, but no one who has spent any time in Beijing can fail to return immeasurably buoyed by the success of the British team and the opportunity that now stands before London.</p> <p>Olympic games usually arrive in the national consciousness like a circus reaching town, a splendid temporary diversion from the everyday that is quickly forgotten once the caravan has moved on. </p> <p>This time it will be different. The success of British athletes in Beijing has provided the perfect boost to Lord Coe and his team as they enter a critical time in delivering the largest peace-time project any city can undertake. </p> <p>Three years after London's Olympic honeymoon was cut short when the 7/7 suicide bombers attacked the transport system within 24 hours of the city being awarded the games, Rebecca Adlington, Chris Hoy, Louis Smith and the rest of the medallists have brought renewed optimism to the project. After three years during which the hugely misleading original budget became a self-inflicted wound that sapped public confidence, London may once again enjoy the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>What is beyond doubt is the scale of the challenge that lies ahead. From the athletes' village to the stadiums, the media facilities to the technology, Beijing has set new standards. Matching them against the background of a credit crunch will test London's ingenuity and the government's nerve.</p> <p>Coe and Paul Deighton, chief executive of the organising committee, acknowledge this, and there is a reassuring air of confidence that the 2012 team can deliver. More than 100 organising committee staff have spent three weeks embedded with the Beijing organisers and their experience will be invaluable. If London can assimilate the huge attention to detail that has distinguished Beijing, the 2012 games will be better for it. </p> <p>But if the technical challenge is significant, the opportunity that lies before London and the UK is huge. The Olympics offer a once-in-a-generation chance to define the capital and the country for a global audience, and after China's show of strength London has a chance to make its own inimitable mark. </p> <p>At their best the games are a celebration, a global party sparked by the innocent delights of sporting endeavour. The athletic achievements may be wrapped in layers of protocol, patriotism and ceremony, but there is no mistaking the authenticity of the feats that lie at their heart.</p> <p>Thanks to the British athletes' exploits in Beijing, spectators will revel in the lunacy of Greco-Roman wrestling and BMX as much as they glory in the best of track and field, even more so if a Brit is involved. Britain invented and formalised the rules of many of the Olympic disciplines, and the athletes will compete before well-informed, appreciative crowds in four years' time.</p> <p>They should also find the sense of fun so obviously absent in Beijing. A city that flocks to outdoor screens for concerts and pubs for football matches, and which grew up on street parties will embrace the Olympic babel. In doing so it will be doing the Olympic movement a huge favour, going some way to remove the taint of the International Olympic Committee's obsequious attitude to China over the last seven years.</p> <p>The biggest winner, however, will be the UK. The Olympics give nations a chance to restate their place in the world and showcase the best of themselves. With London determined to stress the youthful, creative, culturally vibrant best of the capital there is every chance they will succeed.</p> <p>It will not be straightforward. Few politicians have been able to resist the reflected glory of the Olympics, and there are signs that the changing political weather is having an impact on London 2012. Several of the figures who delivered the games, including Tony Blair and Ken Livingstone, have left the stage, and with the Brown government apparently on borrowed time, the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, may be next. </p> <p>With the London mayor, Boris Johnson, drifting off-message on transport plans and the legacy use of the stadium, Coe has a job on his hands to hold the centre.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Sculthorpe improved his chances of making St Helens' team for the Challenge Cup final as he played the full 80 minutes in a victory yesterday that takes Daniel Anderson's side to equal first place in the Super League. Anderson rested a handful of his leading lights ahead of Saturday's showdown with Hull FC, and his young squad members, headed by Kyle Eastmond, stepped up to record what could be a crucial win.</p> <p>While Sculthorpe's ability to play the full game after a series of injuries pleased his coach, the Saints look certain to be without Jason Cayless for the Wembley final after the prop damaged a knee ligament in the opening stages. Anderson said that Cayless is now \"highly unlikely\" to play at Wembley, while fellow front-rower Maurie Fa'asavalu remains a significant doubt due to a hamstring injury. </p> <p>Anderson's prop options were helped by what the coach described as a \"solid\" display by Nick Fozzard, who continues his recovery from a long-term knee injury, but it looks increasingly likely that Sculthorpe's experience in the back row will required from the bench at least. \"I deliberately played Paul for the full 80 minutes, even though he probably wasn't ready for 80 minutes,\" said Anderson.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of missed tackles there, but if it had been a normal week I would have given him a rest and that would have eradicated a lot of the looseness in his game. Wild horses wouldn't stop him from making himself available for Wembley.\"</p> <p>The Saints fell behind after two minutes to a freakish try, initiated by a rushed Eorl Crabtree kick and finished by Stuart Jones. But Sean Long then took control for the visitors, creating two of the three tries for an 18-6 lead at half-time. Keiron Cunningham scored the first with a trademark effort from dummy-half, before Long attacked the line on the last tackle to create a try for Willie Talau. The Saints' scrum half was involved in a scrappy third try, as the young stand-off picked up a loose pass and sent Eastmond over.</p> <p>Huddersfield hinted at a comeback when centre Paul Whatuira scored twice in the opening 13 minutes of the second half to close the gap to two points. But the Saints pulled away as Sculthorpe laid on a try for Chris Flannery then the young wing Dean McGilvray showed good speed to race over from 50 metres. Danny Kirmond recorded an equally eye-catching try for the home side but Saints had the final word as Eastmond took his points haul to 18 in the last minute with his second try.</p> <p><strong>Huddersfield Giants</strong> Hodgson; Aspinwall, Brown, Whatuira, Elford; Thorman, Robinson; Crabtree, Hudson, Mason, Jones, Lolesi, Wild. <strong>Interchange</strong> Griffin, Faiumu, Raleigh, Kirmond.</p> <p><strong>St Helens</strong> Eastmond; Gardner, Gilmour, Talau, McGilvray; Wheeler, Long; Fozzard, Cunningham, Cayless, Flannery, Sculthorpe, Hargreaves. <strong>Interchange</strong> Meli, Graham, Clough, Thompson.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> B Thaler (Wakefield).</p>",

You try winning eight gold medals.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>It is possible to get traffic moving in a major city.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Be so scared of crowds assembling to enjoy the Games. Fanzones in Stratford and along The Mall please.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Take your pick from shooting, taekwondo, synchronised swimming.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Darts. If archery and shooting are Olympic sports, why not?</p> <h2>Robert Kitson</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Bolt and Phelps in the 100m and 100m butterfly respectively. Two once-in-a-lifetime performances inside 24 hours.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Let us just say Australia's final position in the medal table will provide rich material for months to come.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington. She is going to be even better in four years' time.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>Bolt. The best thing to come out of Jamaica since reggae and Michael Holding.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Thousands of smiling, helpful volunteers did a wonderful job of deflecting attention away from China's less attractive aspects. If London is full of scowling jobsworths the 2012 Games will be doomed from the start.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Turn a blind eye to under-age gymnasts in a blinkered quest for gold at all costs.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>If the world's best individuals are not involved, the sport concerned should not be in the Games. So farewell, then, football.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Rugby union. A sevens tournament with a genuine edge would transform all manner of outdated perceptions and transform the funding available to second and third tier nations.</p> <h2>Lawrence Donegan</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Arguing between Usain Bolt in the 100m or Michael Phelps' eight gold medals is like arguing over who is the better painter: Goya or Picasso? Can we not call it a dead heat and count ourselves privileged to have seen both?</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Usain Bolt's decision to sprint for only 75 metres of the 100m final.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Christine Ohuruogu is a controversial figure but it is time to move on. The born-and-bred Londoner is the personification of multicultural Britain. She should light the torch.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>The Aussie swimmer Grant Hackett. Denied a gold medal in the men's 1500m by a competitor who made it to Beijing only after his drugs ban was reduced, he had every right to be bitter. Instead Hackett was so gracious in defeat he made me cry.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Different rules apply in a totalitarian state but London must get the little things right - infrastructure, ticketing, helpful volunteers. Keeping the restaurant and hotel prices reasonable would also be good, though probably asking too much.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>We should open our doors to the world. The Olympics are about promoting sport, not the greater glory of the hosts.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Beach volleyball. I always suspected it was a ridiculous sport but not until these Games did I learn the rules state there is a maximum size for the bikinis worn by the female players. A sport for the dirty old men Olympics, not the proper Olympics.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>An event involving the consumption of blueberry muffins from the media village cafe. It will allow me to fulfil my lifelong ambition of winning an Olympic gold medal.</p> <h2>William Fotheringham</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Emma Pooley's silver in the time-trial. Proof that you can still rock up and get on with it, without big sponsorship bucks and without life-long obsession. Hope for all who are not stars by 18.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Paula Radcliffe. Not in what she did but the fact that she was there at all. What was the point?</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Shanaze Reade, in the women's track sprint. And Victoria Pendleton in the road race.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsman</strong></p> <p>Chris Hoy. A star, a worker and an ambassador. And clean.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>Smiles and patience. Coherent transport planning for the Games.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Totally divorce the Games from the real life of the city.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>About 50% of the swimming. Too many events, with all respect to Phelps.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Rugby. More global than many sports here and great post-event parties. The calendar might be an issue.</p> <h2>Steve Bierley</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Bolt's win in the 100m. The mind may have flashed back to Ben Johnson but this was the most astounding sprint.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>The scheduling for the track and field. It never really seemed to build to the usual climax.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Pippa Wilson. She is an outstanding sailor who is talented enough to go it alone for gold next time.</p> <p><strong>Best sportsmen and women</strong></p> <p>The whole of the British sailing team who supported one another throughout in difficult conditions.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>To get everything finished well ahead of time</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Produce a plethora of dreadfully banal Olympic music.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Where to begin ... men's football and all the tennis.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>The Tornado class (catamaran), the most exciting of the sailing classes that has been dropped for London.</p> <h2>Andy Bull</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>The astonishingly emotional reaction of Matthias Steiner when he won gold in the men's +105kg weightlifting. His wife died in a car crash in 2007 and he carried a portrait of her on to the rostrum and kissed it.</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>The Murray brothers who, if they had wanted it more, could have been one of the most enjoyable British stories.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>The entire US team, who will spend four years plotting revenge on China in the medal table.</p> <p><strong>Best sportswoman</strong></p> <p>Natalie du Toit, who finished 16th in the women's 10km swim despite her left leg being amputated beneath the knee.</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>The most important thing about the mood of the Games is how much the population of the host city enjoy it and in turn how welcome they make the visitors feel.</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Knock down over half of the city centre to replace it with new build.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>None of them, the more the better.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>Rugby Sevens. It is fast and fun to watch, simple enough to play in any part of the world, is not dependent on presence of the most famous players and has diverse competitive nations.</p> <h2>Pete Nichols</h2> <br> <p><strong>Best moment</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington's 800m swim</p> <p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong></p> <p>Simeon Williamson. The British 100m peaked for the trials not the Games.</p> <p><strong>One to watch for 2012</strong></p> <p>Daniel Keatings - gymnastics</p> <p><strong>Best sportswoman</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington</p> <p><strong>What London can learn from Beijing</strong></p> <p>No point: London does not learn much from anyone</p> <p><strong>What London should not do</strong></p> <p>Not make the Games for its own people.</p> <p><strong>Sports that should be dropped</strong></p> <p>Race walking, beach volleyball, synchronised swimming, trampolining, BMX racing and dressage.</p> <p><strong>Sport that should be added</strong></p> <p>The kilo in cycling.</p>",

  "<p>Georgia said yesterday that it would appeal to the international community this week to pressure Russia to end its \"occupation\", adding that Russian troops were now digging in across the country in violation of the ceasefire deal.</p> <p>Russian soldiers established about 25 checkpoints over the weekend, including some outside the original conflict zone and in areas adjacent to the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgian officials said. Russia said its troops were no longer an occupying force but merely performing peacekeeping operations. It added that it could keep soldiers on Georgian territory under an agreement following civil wars in both breakaway republics in the early 90s.</p> <p>Georgia said the troops' presence on its territory was illegal. \"Russia has no right to establish checkpoints in Georgia. The ceasefire agreement is the only agreement that is still alive. All others are broken,\" interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashviavi told the Guardian.</p> <p>He added: \"Georgia considers this as a continuation of occupation. They have just changed their helmets. Georgia will continue to observe the ceasefire and launch international diplomatic initiatives to force Russia to keep its word.\"</p> <p>French president Nicolas Sarkozy signalled continuing European dismay at the situation by announcing a special meeting devoted to Georgia for next Monday at which the EU will consider future relations with Moscow.</p> <p>Also yesterday, firefighters tried to extinguish a blaze on a railway line near Gori - caused when a train carrying crude oil from Kazakhstan rolled over a mine. Twelve tanker cars slithered off the line. </p> <p>Georgian officials said the attack was the latest attempt by Russia to destroy its infrastructure and to stop the transit through Georgia of oil from Azerbaijan and other Caspian Sea nations. A large artillery shell had been wedged under the tracks and hidden by stones, Georgian investigators said.</p> <p>Under the ceasefire deal brokered by Sarkozy, Russia is obliged to withdraw its forces to their pre-August 7 positions - before Georgia launched its brief, disastrous incursion into rebel-held South Ossetia. On Saturday, however, the deputy chief of Russia's army, Colonel General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said this wouldn't happen. Instead, he unveiled a comprehensive network of new checkpoints leaving Russia in control of Georgia's strategic road links and the Black Sea port of Poti.</p> <p>Under Russia's \"peacekeeping plan\", soldiers would establish checkpoints outside the conflict zone, he admitted. These included two outside Poti, several others next to the main east-west highway linking Tbilisi to the Black Sea, and one at Shavshebi, 25 miles west of the capital.</p> <p>On Saturday, about 1,000 Georgians marched on the checkpoint four miles from Poti. They waved Georgian flags and threw leaflets at the Russian soldiers with the slogan \"No to Russian chauvinism and Russian fascism\". </p> <p>In neighbouring Batumi, the US naval warship McFaul delivered humanitarian aid supplies yesterday in the latest sign of Washington's support for its beleaguered ally. Moscow has criticised the growing number of US and other Nato ships in the Black Sea, saying they do not \"contribute\" to solving the conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Already reeling from the loss of its chairman over the lost tax data scandal, HMRC faces disintegration of its already strained relationship with taxpayers over the authority's adoption of new powers.</p> <p>The department is already facing an increase in the number of disputes, accusations that it is unfairly driving people into bankruptcy and concerns that it is mishandling tax credit cases. </p> <p>It has led one leading body to call for reintroduction of a taxpayers' charter - the safeguard introduced by the Major government in the 1990s but dropped by Labour after the 1997 election.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Taxation believes HMRC needs to redraw its relationship with taxpayers based on a mix of statutory rights and a charter. It said rights of appeal, time limits on investigations and protection against disclosure of confidential information or legal advice should be given proper statutory form.</p> <p>\"There are some more general, broader rights for which a charter is the more suitable instrument,\" it said.</p> <p>\"For example, you have the right to be believed in anything you tell the revenue authorities, unless there is evidence that what you are saying is not true; the revenue authorities should collect the right amount of tax, not necessarily the maximum amount of tax which could be levied; you have the right to be represented at a meeting with the revenue authorities by a person of your choice.\"</p> <p>A recent study by City law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain found a 37% jump in the number of applications made to the tax tribunals over the space of a year, from 3,146 in 2006 to 4,311 in 2007. It said the figures confirm that taxpayers are increasingly prepared to challenge HMRC's \"aggressive tax collection tactics and harsh penalties\".</p> <p>One such case involves Neil Martin, a builder from Preston who saw his business go to the verge of bankruptcy in 2001 after HMRC failed to process his application for a tax exemption certificates for months. Without the certificates he lost hundreds of thousands of pounds. He complained and after a long appeal received an apology and \u00a355,000.</p> <p>He was forced to go to court and in a landmark decision last year, a tax tribunal ruled that HMRC owed him a duty of care after it was found to have made \"persistent errors\" in calculating his tax. However, the tribunal ruled against the builder, who said he lost \u00a3500,000 and faced a \u00a3250,000 tax bill as a result of the debacle.</p> <p>Martin is now pursuing the case in the House of Lords. His barrister, James Kessler QC, is challenging HMRC over whether it has the right to submit secret evidence to tax tribunals. In Martin's case, HMRC obtained legal advice from a government department that influenced the outcome of an appeal. A tribunal allowed HMRC to submit evidence in support of its arguments in a closed session, meaning Martin was unable to challenge what was submitted.</p> <p>Last year the Information Commissioner backed HMRC, though it criticised the tax authority after it refused to disclose reasons for keeping the advice secret. Kessler believes the tribunal's decision sets a dangerous precedent.</p> <p>While more taxpayers are prepared to challenge HMRC, the time limit on rebates of overpaid tax which are gained from successful appeals is to be reduced from five to four years. Accountants UHY Hacker Young said 44% of claims are for tax refunds that go back six years and the average claim was for \u00a31,963.</p> <p>It said the system would be unfair because HMRC will often still be able to recover underpaid tax \"for longer than the four-year limit\".</p> <p>Some tax advisers accept that HMRC is not an aggressive arm of government waging war on taxpayers, not least because it does not have the firepower for that. Internal reviews have shown that HMRC's IT systems are in disarray and staff morale is at an all-time low.</p> <p>The addition of tax credits to its list of responsibilities has also complicated its relationship with taxpayers. Many tax credit recipients are vulnerable and on low wages. Officials have found treating them as if they are affluent tax dodgers has proved counter-productive.</p> <h2>Case study</h2> <p><strong>Patrick Cullinane, </strong>has campaigned to overturn his bankruptcy since 1992 without success. The former Pinewood stage hand was accused by HMRC of making six-figure profits from letting his semi in London and moonlighting from his film industry job. A claim by the Revenue for \u00a368,000 in unpaid tax eventually led to his bankruptcy and eviction from his home. A succession of leaked documents and emails from HMRC reveal there was no evidence for either allegation. His home was largely uninhabitable during the period of the claim. His \"moonlighting\" involved returning to Ireland between film jobs to see his family. The case rested on accusations by an \"unnamed informer\". In correspondence, investigators discussed how the case could be thrown out if the lack of evidence was questioned by an appeals tribunal. Evidence put to the high court shows that Cullinane, far from owing tax, was due a rebate.</p>",
  "<p>The award-winning writer and producer behind The Thick of It and I'm Alan Partridge has called on the BBC to launch a subscription channel to fund rivals to ambitious US shows such as The Sopranos and The Wire. </p> <p>Armando Iannucci, who has made a string of acclaimed comedies for the BBC, said Britain needed its own rival to HBO, the American cable network that has become synonymous with distinctive, intelligent drama and comedy. </p> <p>He said a new, subscription-funded channel would free the BBC from its regulatory shackles and unleash a torrent of creativity. US subscription networks have been able to invest in slow-burning, complex dramas without the twin pressures of chasing ratings because of their advertisers, or justifying commissioning decisions to licence-fee payers.</p> <p>\"What I feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation, backed by money,\" he told an audience of broadcasting executives at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV festival. </p> <p>\"A channel that becomes home of the best programme-makers, the best writers, the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators, a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience.\" </p> <p>The likes of HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central have become home to what is often lauded as some of the best television in the world, with recent hits including The Daily Show, Mad Men and Curb Your Enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"Uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers, the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment, but on a big rather than timid scale,\" said Iannucci. </p> <p>He said they had also raised the bar for their major network rivals, resulting in a wave of original, high-concept shows such as Heroes, Lost and Prison Break. </p> <p>Those shows have also tended to sell well around the world and attract committed, loyal followings who will shell out for DVD box sets and related merchandise. </p> <p>Iannucci, whose hit The Thick of It mocked the world of politics, passionately defended the BBC but said it was inevitable its funding would be cut in the coming years and that \"whatever the BBC says and does, it will get it in the neck\". </p> <p>\"Let's take a wager that the BBC brand is the best TV brand in the world, that people will pay for that brand,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations, but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the British television industry, the best in the world, can do.\" </p> <p>The programmes could eventually be shown on the free-to-air networks, and help could be made available for those who couldn't afford to subscribe, he said.</p> <p>A survey conducted by the BBC during the last debate about the level of the licence fee found that three-quarters of the viewing public wanted new services to be funded by subscription. </p> <p>Iannucci, who has his own comedy unit based at the BBC's TV Centre, said channel controllers in the UK had become overly prescriptive in recent years about the formats they required and the audiences they wanted to target, instead of trusting creative talent. </p> <p>At the BBC, he said, producers were in danger of being squeezed between a mass-market BBC1 and lesser-resourced digital channels such as BBC3 and BBC4. He said his plan for a subscription channel would help the BBC fight back against its critics. </p> <p>\"There's too much at stake, too vital a contribution to our culture, to let its critics start to pull it apart now. I want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has. More specifically, I want it to plug a gap I still see in the British TV market, one which, once filled, can give the individual programme-maker the impetus to make the distinctive, the surprising, the lavish, the intimate, the experimental, unhampered by the constraints the BBC normally has to operate under.\"</p> <p>He admitted he wasn't \"going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work\" and the idea would be likely to raise further complaints from rivals already up in arms about the BBC's increasingly aggressive commercial arm. </p> <p>During another festival session yesterday, Time Out founder Tony Elliott attacked the BBC for being \"out of control\" following its purchase of travel guidebook publisher Lonely Planet. </p> <p>Iannucci also echoed an earlier call from Peter Fincham, ITV's director of television, who delivered the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the festival on Friday, not to confuse myriad new-media outlets with a diminished desire from viewers for high-quality programmes to watch on them. </p> <p>Broadcasters such as BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are coming under pressure as the historical models that have supported them collapse, leading to some of the optimism generated by Fincham's rallying cry draining away over the weekend as their futures were debated.</p> <p>But for programme-makers, Iannucci said it was a \"profoundly exciting moment in television for the creative talent\" because their work was now available to a global audience. </p> <p>He said he was amazed at the upsurge in interest in British comedy in the US, which has partly come about because it is now easy for US executives to sample it online.</p> <h2>US hits</h2> <p><strong>The Wire (HBO)</strong> </p> <p>Sprawling, Shakespearean crime tale set in Baltimore and sporting a huge cast. Regularly cited as a favourite show by television executives addicted to the DVD box sets.

  "<p>Since January, the term knife crime has been used more than 1,500 times by the national press - and it is a fair bet that most media images associated with these figures will be of young black men. Unsurprisingly, this is leading to a growing sense of frustration among black community leaders, academics and, not least, black youngsters themselves, over what they see as blatant misrepresentation.</p> <p>Black youths who fit this media stereotype represent a tiny fraction of the young black population as a whole, they argue, and while negative stories about black teenagers are almost guaranteed headlines, the positive achievements of black youth go largely ignored.</p> <p>This trend has consequences beyond creating an unbalanced picture. Numerous studies have shown a clear link between media furore and draconian policy-making, says Kjartan Sveinsson, the author of a Runnymede Trust report on the ways in which popular understandings of race and crime influence media reporting, and vice versa. \"The tragedy is this can increase racial tension on the street and do little to stem the violence,\" he says.</p> <p>Which in turn, of course, leads to further reports of violence, and the circle continues. In April 2007, for instance, after a number of high-profile shootings in south London, Tony Blair made a speech to the Cardiff Chamber of Commerce. Was he perhaps responding to media pressure when he asked: \"When are we going to start saying this [gang crime] is a problem amongst a section of the black community and not, for reasons of political correctness, pretend it has nothing to do with it?\" </p> <p>There was no ambiguity when David Cameron spoke after the death of 11-year-old Rhys Jones in Liverpool, singling out the media by saying: \"Deaths by fists, knives and guns are becoming a regular feature of British news ... these murders must draw a line in the sand.\"</p> <p>In Manchester, one group of black teenagers, who believe they should have made headlines for the right reasons, are angry at their treatment by the media. So much so they have published an open letter on the subject (see below</p> <p>The Reclaim project began as a pilot in the autumn of 2007 at Urbis, an exhibition centre in Manchester, to work with 12-14-year-old boys from Moss Side and other perceived trouble spots in the city. The idea was spawned as a reaction to rising youth violence and the negative portrayal of young people, especially from the African-Caribbean community.</p> <p>The project involves six months of intensive mentoring and events, including working with local statutory bodies and creative and sports providers. Self-development, discipline and anger-management courses form part of the syllabus, along with teamwork and respect for legitimate authority. Children on the project have drawn up an advisory document on combating gun and knife crime and presented it to Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The scheme has been a remarkable success - and Reclaim has become synonymous with a powerful youth voice. Its story should be positive, but some of the young people involved feel they have been either ignored or that when journalists have turned up, most have only wanted to question them on guns and gangs. </p> <p>In particular, some of the boys were unhappy about their treatment at the hands of a production company filming a documentary. They say they had understood it would be about their involvement with Reclaim, but the interviewer constantly brought up the subject of guns and gangs.</p> <p><strong>Fair representation?</strong></p> <p>On one occasion, the boys had been to a formal meeting and were wearing suits. According to 14-year-old Akeim, he and other boys were asked to go home and change into tracksuits and hooded tops and were then interviewed in the park where a 15-year-old boy, Jessie James, was murdered. Another boy, Amari, says the programme, shown on Channel 4 in July, failed to include a single mention of the Reclaim project and \"was all about Jessie James\". The interviewer asked whether he, or any of the other boys, had ever shot anybody, or been shot at, Amari says.</p> <p>C4 says the producers \"strongly feel\" the young men were accurately and fairly represented in the short film, which was shown as part of a season of programmes about gun and knife crime. The boys were filmed where they said they regularly spend their time and were happy to be interviewed in those locations. They were not asked to dress in a way they wouldn't normally, and there was no intention or attempt to portray the young people as stereotypical or negative characters, the broadcaster says.</p> <p>Professor Gus John, a fellow of the Institute of Education at the University of London, works closely with families affected by violence in Manchester. \"When black youths read about themselves,\" he says, \"it goes something like this: you are a persistently under-performing group; you are six times more likely to be excluded from school and be a young offender; you may already be in a gang, or likely to join one. The likely causes of your condition are: absentee fathers; absence of positive role models; and being surrounded by women who cannot control or motivate you. You aim too low and do not believe people like you can succeed.\"</p> <p>Yet the reality, John says, is that there are a large number of young black males with high aspirations, who have a focus on learning and who succeed. \"Often, these young men come from the same background as those who are underachieving at school, or involved with the criminal justice system. It is a sad fact that we seldom hear about these young people.\"</p> <p><strong>Reclaim's open letter</strong></p> <p>\"We are a group of 14-year-old boys from the Reclaim project; since the project started, we have been approached by so many different newspapers, magazines and TV companies, most of who want to talk to us about guns and knives and gangs. We keep trying to explain that we are not involved in gangs and crime; we're black boys doing positive things in this area - and then journalists go away, as they tell us that's not the story people are interested in ...</p> <p>The project has changed our lives in so many ways. We now consider ourselves reliable, respectable, articulate and creative young black men. We have been set difficult challenges and worked hard to achieve them. We have written a manifesto for our area and given up our weekends to distribute it, display it and explain it to the adult members of our community. We have put on parties for vulnerable members of our community, lobbied the leader of our council and spoken in front of hundreds of people ... </p> <p>Negative stories of young black boys as criminals, or victims of crime, reinforces the idea that this is the reality for black people. Some young black boys will try and live up to the images they see in the media. Adults constantly criticise teenagers for being irresponsible, but the way the media tries to represent our area as if everyone was a drugs runner or gangster is totally irresponsible and morally wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>What explains the steep decline of the regional and local press? Since 1989, circulation is down 51% to 12,549 for the Birmingham Post; 49% to 70,028 for the Leicester Mercury; 43% to 50,256 for the Northern Echo; 62% to 32,874 for the Argus in Sussex; 38% to 38,844 for the Echo in Southend; 38% to 36,516 for the Herald in Plymouth; 49% to 20,976 for the Oldham Evening Chronicle; 46% to 19,956 for the Halifax Evening Courier. North, south, east, west, large, small, morning and evening, the story for Britain's local papers is one of unremitting gloom.</p> <p>Scarcely a month passes without news of further cutbacks. Last week, all 300 editorial staff on Trinity Mirror's Midlands titles, including the Birmingham Post and Coventry Telegraph, were told they will have to reapply for their jobs. After restructuring, more than 20% may be out of work (a report from Coventry's newsroom follows below this column). Johnston Press, another big group, is cutting budgets and jobs at papers such as the Scotsman and the Sheffield Star. The company's share price, 393p a year ago, was down to 53.50p last Friday and, at one stage, went as low as 30p.</p> <p>Yet it is not obvious, even taking account of the internet, local radio and freesheets, that the regional press was always doomed to this fate. A few national newspapers, such as the Mirror and Express, have suffered similar declines over the past 20 years, but most have not - and some, such as the Times and Mail, now sell more copies, even though the competition they face is more intense. Magazines such as the Economist and Spectator also flourish.</p> <p>In opinion polls, people frequently complain about the London-centric national media. Why have regional and local papers failed to fill the gap? The usual answer is that publishers have cut too much, leaving too few reporters too little time to dig out news that might grip readers' attention. </p> <p>Despite the circulation declines, the local press, until very recently, enjoyed buoyant advertising revenues and profit margins sometimes above 30%. Surely, journalists say, publishers should lower margins and protect their own future. But this misunderstands how capitalism works. As investors see it, perhaps rightly, newspapers have few prospects for growth, even if they are well-managed. With no expectations of long-term gains, they demand high, short-term dividends. </p> <p>The recent plunge in share prices shows how quickly investors pull out when profits fall. Most national newspapers are, to some extent, protected from this crude capitalist logic because, even if they are not run by a Guardian-style trust, individuals such as Rupert Murdoch and Tony O'Reilly, seeking influence or kudos, hold controlling stakes.</p> <p>Cuts are clearly a big part of the story. But we need also to consider what Bob Franklin of Cardiff University's media school has called the McDonaldisation of journalism, delivering \"predictable and standardised newspapers\". As Franklin points out, \"the local press is now virtually a tabloid press\". That is true not just in page size - the Birmingham Post, one of the last broadsheets, will go tabloid as part of Trinity Mirror's reorganisation - but also in editorial approach. </p> <p>Open any local paper now, whether you are in Bath or Barnsley, and you get the same diet of health, family, travel and consumer issues, plus human interest stories, all presented in the same way. Court cases and council meetings, once staple material for the local press, are largely ignored. Few papers convey any sense of covering local community life. The editorial agenda is often remarkably similar to that of the national redtops. For example, my local paper in Essex writes obsessively about the comedian Michael Barrymore who, though he lives locally in the house where a man mysteriously drowned in 2001, is hardly a local figure.</p> <p>The local papers' loss of locality is part of the same phenomenon that has created \"clone towns\" where high streets are dominated by chain stores and look the same from Cornwall to Cumbria. Locally owned papers have disappeared just like locally owned shops and restaurants: five publishing groups control about 80% of circulation. And, as national governments have taken more power, local politics has declined. If papers judge that readers are no longer interested in council meetings, they are probably right.</p> <p>In other words, the decline of the local press is another aspect of the homogenisation of British life. Is there any hope of salvation? Publishers and editors are cottoning on to the idea that people are still interested in local news, provided it is local enough and covers, at most, a single postcode area with a maximum population of 30,000. Trinity Mirror, for example, has tried \"hyperlocal\" websites in Teesside and believes it can \"reverse publish\" them by printing the copy, much of it user-generated, in free papers. Hyperlocality, however, involves treading a fine line.</p> <p>Somehow, an editor has to overcome what has been called \"the pothole paradox\". To you, news of repairs on your own street, or on your route to the pub, is far more interesting than, say, a plane crash in Madrid, but similar news from a mile away is the most boring thing imaginable. Whoever finds a solution to that conundrum, and develops a business model to sustain it, will surely be hailed as the saviour of the local press.</p> <p><strong>Lazy journalism gets mentally stronger</strong></p> <p>I think of it as my Atlantic Monthly moment. That distinguished American magazine once prepared a fine cover story with the headline \"Peace is hell\". Between it going to press and it hitting the newsstands, 9/11 happened. </p> <p>On a less apocalyptic note, I wrote an Observer book review explaining why the British are always losers at sport. It appeared in the middle of what the Guardian's Richard Williams called \"a weekend of intoxicating and almost unrelieved success\" for our Olympics team, which rose to third in the medals table.</p> <p>So I sympathised as I heard the grinding of newspaper gears. Out with those perennial stories, which journalists had been composing in their heads for weeks, about how our welfare state makes young people lazy, our food makes them unfit and our schools make them uncompetitive. In, as the Daily Telegraph headlined, came \"the Great British Olympics\". Our youth were now lean, fit, healthy, dedicated, energetic, and (sports journalists make a lot of this point) mentally strong. </p> <p>But the Daily Mail will always bring us down to earth. \"What those gold medals tell us about a very divided Britain\", read its main comment page headline. </p> <p>Forty per cent of the winners, Leo McKinstry pointed out, went to fee-paying private schools, who educate fewer than 10% of the nation's children. The usual Mail culprits were named and shamed: state schools' failure to encourage excellence, the excess of women teachers in primary schools, and \"the health and safety brigade\".</p> <p>In the Telegraph, Boris Johnson - writing, as usual, without engaging any part of his body from the wrist upwards - embarrassed his party leader by suggesting Beijing showed talk of a \"broken society\" to be \"piffle\". </p> <p>How reassuring, in an ever-changing world, to know that the Mail at least remains firm in its convictions.</p>",
  "<p>You know those big rubber tummies men were once urged to wear so they could experience some of the waddling impact of being pregnant? Well, I have spent the summer undergoing a parallel experience getting some small hint of what it's like to be old and disabled. It wasn't anything like a perfect mimicry (thank God), but it has been a chastening and educative experience. All that happened was one of those smallest and most humdrum of accidents, tripping in haste, which led to a broken bone in my foot - of all the things, the classic footballer's metatarsal injury. I've been wincing on crutches all summer and have many weeks of hobbling still ahead. One tiny break in a bone, smaller than a child's pencil, has reduced me to being carried through airports on those officiously bleeping carts. </p> <p>It has meant wheelchairs to travel any further than 50 metres, and aching arms and shoulders from \"crutching it\" even small distances each day. It has meant endless waiting to be picked up by friends and relatives. It has obliged me to give up most activities except for nervous swims in the pool, twitching in case someone bangs my foot. I haven't been able to shop for more than a few things by myself, because you cannot carry a decent-sized bag on crutches. I have just started, gingerly, to drive an automatic car (it's the left foot that is injured), but still need help getting out at the other end. Again, small things compared to what millions of people put up with. But it has been a revelation. You see humankind at its best and worst.</p> <p>So many people are helpful - smiling, standing aside, asking thoughtful questions. Can I do this for you? Can you manage? Others, inevitably, give a half-suppressed glower of irritation when they see you hobbling - and don't think twice about mowing you down. Though it is one of the oldest cliches in the disablement book, I discovered it afresh: in a wheelchair, for some you don't exist and for others you need to be talked to - very - slowly - because - let's face it, if you cannot use your legs you're probably a bit simple.</p> <p>Well, we know all this. I knew it, you knew it. It's just that abstract knowing has little impact compared to experiencing something. Almost everyone reading this is going to have a similar experience. Not necessarily a broken metatarsal, obviously. But many will have disabilities or accidents at some time in their lives, while for the overwhelming majority old age is going to arrive, with sticks, wheelchairs and stairlifts, and a new age of polite requests and apologies for taking so long. </p> <p>The news last week that pensioners finally outnumber children for the first time was hardly news. That statistical moment has been rolling towards us like a dogged old dear on an electric buggy, with no intention of taking avoiding action, for years. Yet the raw numbers make you blink: 11.6 million pensioners and nearly twice as many over-80s in the past quarter-century. Towns on the south coast and elsewhere have gone silvery-grey, served by an embattled minority of youngsters, often with eastern European accents.</p> <p>Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing hardly matters. Healthcare has delayed death, something all politicians applaud. We'd never choose to go back to the mortality rates of 30 years ago. But the corollary is that healthcare has delivered for millions a miserable quality of life towards the end - poverty, pain and worry - and politicians have been strangely silent about that.</p> <p>The current phenomenon of the affluent middle-class old won't last. The generation with its final salary or index-linked pensions, able to use the long boom in property prices to finance cruises, foreign holidays and costly private care, has been lucky. The generation growing up and starting work now is unlucky - they are the ones who will have to shoulder the financial and physical burden of an ageing population.</p> <p>My lot, people in their 40s and 50s, are a hinge generation. It's our duty to help make the transition. More enforced saving for everyone above the poverty line will have to come. If medicine has produced fit, alert 70-year-olds then the notion that they shouldn't work, even if they want to, is barmy.</p> <p>One day they will have to be expected to do some work, whether they like it or not. It was never intended by William Beveridge, or the other founders of the welfare state, that every citizen should be entitled to 20 or 30 - or 40 - years of R&amp;R. If we are fit and able, we should be contributing, being paid, or at least volunteering. It is not surprising that politicians don't like these topics. Today's pensioners grew old under a clear social contract about a guaranteed retirement age - and they vote. It will be a slow and delicate business to reopen the deal. </p> <p>But it has to be done. The sums don't work, otherwise - the taxation of the smaller proportion of younger working people, needed to finance pensions, plus good health and social care for the ever-expanding oldsters, would be too big a burden. It's not one I wish my children to have to carry on my account. More important, tens of thousands of bored, frustrated pensioners would love to be back at work now. Yes, the elderly may walk and work more slowly, but that doesn't mean they will be less productive workers - it is simply a matter of adjustments being made. Even today, despite years of legislation to protect the disabled, it is far too difficult to get around in a wheelchair or on crutches. </p> <p>The trouble with any discussion of ageing is that it's so bloody depressing. All those aches and pains, and things that can't be done any more. No wonder we want to talk about something else. But there is a lot of enjoyment to be had in one's 80s or 90s. There's a whole world of dry gallows humour, sardonic reflection and wisdom.</p> <p>Yet the basic political choices are tough ones. So long as politics finds them too tough to talk about, politicians are betraying the millions who need more consideration now, and the rest of us who will one day be in their position. If I'm going to be expected to work in my late 60s, I'd like to know now. If I need to cut back my spending to save for the years after that, politicians need to start insisting. That's leadership.</p> <p>But my brief, self-inflicted journey into Oldie World reminded me that whatever politicians do or don't do, the biggest difference is other people's attitudes. Empathy is golden. Smiles, pauses, a door held open, a little less impatience, can shift a day from dark to light - not a bad lesson to take from one hopping, wincing, rainy summer.<br><a href=\"mailto:j.ashley@theguardian.com\"><br>j.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The star turn at today's opening of the Democratic convention, watched by up to 20 million Americans on primetime TV, will fall to three people with surprisingly down-to-earth CVs: a hospital manager, a basketball coach and a high-school teacher. But what they lack in glamorous titles they make up in blood and marital connections to Barack Obama.</p> <p>Today is unofficial family day in Denver, and instead of political luminaries and grandees of the party, the show will be dominated by the candidate's wife, brother-in-law and half-sister. Top of the billing will be Michelle Obama, with the build-up to her headline speech this evening provided by her brother, Craig Robinson, and Barack's half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng.</p> <p>There is nothing new in playing the family card at conventions - Tipper Gore spoke in support of her husband, Al, in 2000, John Kerry's daughter Alexandra was rolled out in 2004, and Laura Bush stumped for George on both occasions - but for family to dominate the first day's proceedings in this way is unusual.</p> <p>\"Family is shaping the content of the entire day, and that's not been done before,\" said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University.</p> <p>The first of the three on stage will be Soetoro-Ng, who teaches in a school in Hawaii. Aged 38, she is nine years younger than Barack. They have the same mother, the late Ann Dunham. Soetoro-Ng is likely to talk about how Barack filled in as a father figure in her life after her parents divorced when she was nine.</p> <p>\"He let me know the world was large, and that I should get to know as much of it as possible,\" she said recently.</p> <p>Then it will be over to Robinson, who will introduce his sister, Michelle Obama. Two years her elder, he has been relatively sparingly used by the Democratic campaign so far but his charisma and engaging smile is expected to be highly televisual.</p> <p>More importantly, he also represents a story that the Obama campaign is keen to highlight throughout the week - that the senator for Illinois and his immediate family have got to where they are today through their own hard work rather than through birth or privilege.</p> <p>\"Craig is an example of the classic American dream,\" says John Rogers, a Chicago businessman who played basketball with Robinson at Princeton University.</p> <p>Rogers points out that Robinson, like his sister, rose from modest beginnings in a four-room bungalow on Chicago's South Side to professional success - in his case as coach for Oregon State university's basketball team.</p> <p>That theme of honest graft appeals to the Obama campaign as a stick with which to beat the Republican opponent, John McCain, whose wealth was largely acquired through his wife Cindy's inheritance.</p> <p>\"They want to contrast the story of Obama, who has been through struggles that many Americans are now facing, with McCain, who seems increasingly out of touch,\" said Mark Mellman, a top strategist for Kerry in his 2004 presidential run.</p> <p>It was Robinson's achievement in getting to Princeton that gave his sister the inspiration to follow in his footsteps. Her stint at Princeton led on to Harvard Law School and then to a Chicago law firm, Sidley and Austin, where she met her future husband.</p> <p>Michelle Obama's speech this evening, timed for maximum TV exposure, will be the highlight of the day but also carries the highest stakes. In the run-up to the convention, the attacks on her have gathered in intensity. Typical of the genre is The Obama Nation, a new book by Dr Jerome Corsi, who four years ago was a leading proponent of the swift boat attack on John Kerry, which sought to undermine the Democratic candidate's record as a Vietnam war hero.</p> <p>Corsi follows the by-now well-trailed portrayal of Michelle Obama as an angry black woman. He dwells on her Princeton thesis on race relations, with its references to the writings of black radical Stokely Carmichael - a connection first made by the British writer Christopher Hitchens - and reminds readers of her gaffe when she talked about being really proud of her country for the \"first time in my adult lifetime\".</p> <p>Corsi concludes that she is a bitter person \"filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the United States\".</p> <p>Such assaults are increasingly vexing for the Obamas. In a recent Marie Claire interview, Barack Obama decried the caricature of his wife as an angry person and said \"She's the most quintessentially American person I know.\"</p> <p>The use of the term \"American\" is pointed. The official title of today's events is One Nation, and through the week the Democrats will seek to present the Obamas as a mainstream American family - no different from any other ordinary American household.</p> <p>It is a picture that crucially is neutral on race - an area that Obama has been consistently keen to keep out of the debate as much as possible.</p> <p>In the run-up to the convention, the campaign has tried to shift Michelle's public image towards the more homely one of housewife and mother.</p> <p>She has appeared on daytime chat shows and talked in interviews about the struggle of juggling work and kids, and Tyra Banks of America's Next Top Model poses as her on the cover of September's Harper's Bazaar, along with an Obama lookalike.</p> <p>\"The challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen. The question is whether she is willing to go along with that,\" Schiller said.</p> <p>Jerry Kellman came to know Michelle in the early days of her relationship with Obama. He predicts that she will prove herself to be a huge asset when she steps on to the stage: \"She is bright and she is gifted, but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that American voters will respond to.\"</p> <p>Kellman will himself be on stage in Denver today, as the man who in 1985 gave Obama his first job as a community organiser in Chicago, on a salary of $10,000 a year. In his speech, he hopes to \"make people aware of the kind of sacrifice Barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope\".</p> <p>A similar tone can be expected in a feature film made for the convention by Davis Guggenheim, who directed Al Gore's Oscar-winning movie An Inconventient Truth about global warming. Edward Kennedy will also address the floor for five minutes by video link from his home in Massachusetts, where he is receiving treatment for a malignant brain tumour.</p> <p>One of the most interesting aspects of the emphasis on family today is who will not be present. The most poignant absence will be that of Madelyn Dunham, or Toot as Obama calls her, his maternal grandmother, who lives in Hawaii, but who at 85 is said to be in fragile health.</p> <p>Absent too will be George Obama, Barack's half-brother and the youngest child of Barack Senior, the Kenyan economist who was briefly married to Ann Dunham while living in Hawaii as an overseas student. George, aged 25, was last week tracked down by the Italian edition of Vanity Fair living in a 6ft by 9ft shack on the outskirts of Nairobi.</p> <p>He told the magazine that he was so ashamed of his impoverished circumstances, living on less than a dollar a month, that he never mentions the fact that his half-brother could soon become the most powerful person on earth.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday August 27 2008. Tipper Gore (not Tippa, as we said in the article above) spoke in support of her husband, Al, at the 2000 Democratic convention. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Wolfgang Vogel, the shadowy lawyer who for years embodied the only channel of communication between the two states set up on German soil after the second world war, has died aged 82, some months after a heart attack ruined his health. The supreme go-between also brokered deals between the Soviet and western blocs in the depths of the cold war, taking money from both sides as he arranged \"spy swaps\" and bought freedom for many thousands of political prisoners and ordinary East Germans.</p> <p>Vogel's pathway to equivocal fame and fortune opened in 1959, when he was approached by the East German wife of Rudolf Abel, a Soviet masterspy caught by the Americans in New York two years earlier, tried, convicted and imprisoned. In 1960, American U2 spyplane flights over the Soviet Union, which had been going on for four years with impunity because the Russians lacked a high-flying anti-aircraft missile, were finally exposed. A technological leap enabled them to shoot down the aircraft piloted by Francis Gary Powers.</p> <p>President Eisenhower tried to lie his way out by claiming the U2 was on a routine weather patrol, but Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, triumphantly produced recovered parts of the aircraft, including instruments and films - and the pilot, who had survived unharmed. A summit between the two leaders in Paris was loudly cancelled by Khrushchev, who turned up just to walk out. Powers was sent to jail after a show trial.</p> <p>Two years on, Vogel took the leading part in constructing a delicate deal whereby Abel was released to the Russians in exchange for Powers. The swap took place on the Glienicke bridge, which straddled the border between east and west Berlin on the divided city's outskirts. Thriller writers and film-makers soon turned this into a long-lasting clich\u00e9, born out by subsequent real-life events at the same spot, which became a symbol of freedom and one of the most famous bridges in the world.</p> <p>Less spectacularly, but at the same time, the East Germans released an American doctoral student and alleged spy - another Vogel client - at that other notorious cold war symbol, Checkpoint Charlie, a Berlin border crossing to the American sector of the city. Vogel had truly found his metier.</p> <p> Perhaps his most famous coup was the exchange release from the Soviet Union in 1986 of the Jewish dissident Anatoly Scharansky, the future Israeli minister Nathan Sharansky. The diminutive ex-prisoner took a running jump over the white border line painted on the deck of the Glienicke bridge in what became a huge media event. Vogel's main client on that occasion was the US government.</p> <p>He was born in Lower Silesia, German until 1945 and then handed over to Poland, whereupon the Vogel family moved to the Soviet zone of Germany. This would become the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1949, in response to the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) from the American, British and French occupation zones. Vogel studied law at Karl Marx University, where he married Eva Anlauf; their son, Manfred, was born in 1947. They also had a daughter, Lilo, but were divorced in 1967 - after Vogel had negotiated their emigration from East to West Germany.</p> <p>He had qualified as a lawyer in 1949 and joined the East German ministry of Justice three years later. </p> <p>His mentor, a judge, fled to West Germany after the abortive anti-communist uprising in East Berlin in 1953, and sent Vogel an invitation to join him. This was intercepted by the Stasi, the fearsome East German state security and espionage agency, which promptly forced him into service, initially as a \"voluntary collaborator\" or informer, and soon as an active legal agent for the regime abroad. The two new German states had turned their backs on each other in 1949 for a quarter of a century. Relations were not bad - they simply did not exist officially. It was only when Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik of reconciliation between Germany and its former enemies made headway in the early 1970s that the two states exchanged \"representations\" or quasi-embassies.</p> <p>Brandt resigned in 1974 when an East German spy, G\u00fcnter Guillaume, was discovered in his inner circle of advisers, put on trial and imprisoned. After much hard work by Vogel, who had developed close relations with Helmut Schmidt, Brandt's successor, Guillaume was released without publicity in 1981 at a village on the intra-German border. Vogel, who was also on very good terms with Erich Honecker, the East German leader, was waiting to welcome him back to East Germany. The communist state's most successful known agent complained that he had hoped to see Vogel rather sooner. By this time the manipulative, ingratiating lawyer was a highly skilled networker and negotiator.</p> <p>Meanwhile the regime was in desperate need of hard currency, and developed a particularly cynical method of acquiring it: the sale of individual freedom, for which the West Germans proved ready and willing to pay. The 34,000 \"political prisoners\" whose release for cash payments Vogel negotiated were commonly classed as such for trying or just openly desiring a move to the west. The 215,000 ordinary East Germans whose transfer westward helped to bring in $2.4bn in hard currency were often elderly, thus relieving the East German state of the need to pay their pensions, also funded by West Germany. But at least a lot of families were reunited as a result.</p> <p>It was an amoral, even brutal, exercise in realpolitik which made Vogel a very rich man as the fees poured in from east and west, the two Germanys and the two superpowers alike. But in 1989 the Berlin wall came down, the communist regime and its Stasi octopus fell and Vogel's services were no longer required. Unsurprisingly he moved west himself, to Schliersee, a pretty lakeside resort in the Bavarian Alps, with Helga, his former assistant and second wife.

He was taken by ambulance to City hospital where he was later pronounced dead.</p> <p>The victim was unemployed and had lived nearby with his mother. Police said he had been socialising with friends and cousins and had visited a number of houses in and around the close with at least two other people before leaving one of the properties alone. It was then that he was killed.</p> <p>Officers said last night said they were aware of gang rivalries in the community, but added that they did not have a motive for the killing and at this early stage were not linking the attack to gang warfare.</p> <p>It is the third fatal shooting in the Newtown area in the past nine months. In March Nehemiah Bryce, 27, of Winson Green, was shot dead just a few hundred metres away, in Rodway Close, after a chase. On December 23 last year, Assar Joseph Mohammed Tomlinson was shot dead during a row outside the King of the Road pub in Hospital Street.</p> <p>On April 1, a teenager and another man were injured when a youth burst into the City Internet shop and fired several shots.</p> <p>\"It is a tragic loss of life,\" said Chief Superintendent Mick Treble. \"We would like to send out an appeal for calm. Where individuals have frictions between them we would ask them to work with the police and with other agencies instead of young people sadly losing their lives. A man who was a son, a brother and a friend has been lost and clearly that should be enough to make people think this is a crime that should not continue to occur. We are aware there are tensions between rival gangs in the community and are alive to that issue, and are working with the city council to enable young people to come together to resolve their differences.\" </p> <p>Hockley Close was yesterday cordoned off while police conducted house to house inquiries and officers appealed for witnesses to come forward. A blue tent stood on the driveway outside the semi-detached house where Foskin was found.</p> <p>A 26-year-old woman from the Newtown area of Birmingham who knew him said Foskin was \"lovely, funny and gentle\".</p> <p>\"I have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this,\" she said. \"He was caring and laid back and he had a very close family. He was a family boy. The people who have done this can run, but they can't hide, and hopefully justice will be done. </p> <p>Local residents yesterday complained that the area had recently become more dangerous, with guns increasingly prevalent. \"It's all drug and gang-related,\" said Colin Murdoch, 46, a lorry driver. \"There's just not enough policing in the area. We need more officers on the beat.\"</p> <p>A 36-year-old woman, who did not wish to be named, said: \"You only have to go to the shops to see people dealing on the corner. Shootings and stabbings are a regular occurrence round here - people need to get out of this area because it's getting worse. We definitely need more policing. People are afraid to go out at night and only come out of their houses at times like this, on a Sunday morning.\"</p> <p>There were reports at the weekend of an emerging conflict in Birmingham between young gang members of the so-called Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew. Last weekend, Matthew Sutherland, 29, was stabbed to death outside the city's Q Club in an attack that was reportedly related to the rivalry. In an alleged revenge attack, a woman was later shot in the arm and a man in the stomach outside an Irish club in the city.</p> <p>Earlier this month there were two drive-by shootings in the Ladywood and Handsworth areas of Birmingham.</p>",

Police said the red and black Nazi symbols were discovered by a guard at the monument on Saturday and were immediately wiped off the seven slabs affected. The memorial to the Holocaust's 6 million Jewish victims is a field of concrete slabs situated close to Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.

Air agency AENA said Spanair flight JK2565 from Barcelona to Lanzarote landed at Malaga airport after it left Barcelona at 8.10am. It was diverted an hour into the journey. The flight, with 141 passengers aboard, was then cancelled. Passengers were put up in a local hotel.

People will be able to hand in guns with no questions asked. The government will pay between 97 and 300 reais (\u00a332 and \u00a3100), depending on the model and condition of the gun. The programme ends in December. A similar campaign in 2004 removed at least 300,000 guns from the streets. Justice minister Tarso Genro said 45m reais was available for the programme.

  "<p>I was intrigued recently to see a painting in the National Gallery by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger, in which a rich man is being led to hell through a subterranean crypt thronged with bats and snakes. Is the bat's nocturnal lifestyle enough to explain these centuries of misrepresentation? Yet while there is definitely nothing evil about bats there is something decidedly liminal. Their wings are no more than a diaphanous parchment, the thickness of a grape skin, stretched over a spider's web of finger-bone. It produces a motion so twisting and elusive you sometimes wonder, as you try to follow one in flight, whether you're seeing the actual creature or just some fading mental impression of a flying bat superimposed upon the space where one has just been.</p> <p>Their echo-location system is one of those truths that outdoes fiction. Bats blast their surroundings with a machine-gun fire of high-frequency pulses then wait for the rebounded calls, which are unscrambled in the bat brain as information on the relative distances and contours of an environment. Essentially they're hearing the appearance of a place. The system is so sensitive they can detect and avoid a wire the thickness of a human hair. They can identify an insect - and judge its edibility - by the way their echoes curve around it. One is flabbergasted not just by the idea of a world sculpted by voice, but by the inner labyrinth of the bat's neurological system which allows the creature a flight of such intricate convolutions when effectively blind. </p> <p>We followed our bat, probably a Daubenton's, on a bat detector, a device which converts the calls to sounds within the human range of audible frequencies. It was a thin metallic crepitation that intensified as the creature swirled down across Rockland Broad. At its closest, the bat's sounds acquired a tachycardia-like intensity and every now and then we caught the creature itself as a brief muster of skittering darkness.</p>",

  "<p>An 18-year-old was stabbed to death near a London shopping centre this morning, the 24th teenager to die violently in the capital this year.</p> <p>It was one of several violent incidents around the country at the weekend, with two more people killed in the West Midlands. One man died after being shot last night and another died of serious injuries following an attack early this morning.</p> <p>The fatal stabbing happened at around 1.40am in Walthamstow, east London.

  "<p>As promised, David Beckham and a double-decker bus featured in today's closing ceremony for the 2008 Olympic Games, along with Leona Lewis, Jimmy Page and Boris Johnson. But they were a minor diversion, only briefly interrupting the second act of Zhang Yimou's Great Patriotic Pageant.</p> <p>The evening opened with a countdown, an explosion of fireworks, and a potted reprise of the sort of Busby Berkeley-meets-House of Flying Daggers extravaganza invented by Zhang, the great film director, for the opening ceremony, this time involving a mere 200 drummers.</p> <p>Early on there was an unscheduled collision involving a wayward monocyclist - whose machine, ingeniously enough, was a single large wheel inside which he sat and pedalled - and a small group of figures got up to resemble a dancing troupe from one of the 56 ethnic minority groups of whom the Chinese have made such play over the last fortnight. They got up, dusted themselves down, and carried on playing their parts.</p> <p>During the entry of the flags, carried by athletes, Chris Hoy did his job with manly resolve and no evident sign of Scottish nationalist sentiment (indeed, he had responded earlier in the day to a Scottish politican's suggestion that the country might consider going it alone in the Olympics by remarking tartly that it could only be taken seriously when Scotland started investing money in sport).</p> <p>The appearance of the athletes created the usual degree of mild interest in their leisurewear. The Italians seemed a mite overdressed in silver jackets and matching shoes, the French carried a string of tricolour bunting that made the centre of the Bird's Nest look like a <em>village fete</em> in the Luberon, the United States athletes - men and women - had been issued with curious white flat caps, the Canadians opted for Pucci-print beach slacks, and there appeared to be an awful lot of Dutch - or maybe orange just has a sort of spreading quality.</p> <p>The medal winners from the men's marathon received their rewards and there was a stirring sight for Africa as the flags of Kenya, Morocco and Ethiopia were raised. Bouquets were presented to a dozen volunteers representing more than 70,000 young people whose unfailing politeness and good humour were even more impressive than the fireworks and the architecture which will be the image left by the 29th Games.</p> <p>Jacques Rogge made a speech in which he praised \"a truly exceptional Games\", the very words Juan Antonio Samaranch, his predecessor as president of the International Olympic Committee, famously used about Atlanta in his closing remarks in 1996, instead of calling it - as was his habit every four years - \"the best Games ever\". At the time, this was taken as the most tremendous snub, which may not have been Rogge's intention.</p> <p>The British national anthem was sweetly sung by a young 28-voice choir, almost half of them visibly from ethnic minorities, a sign of the approach that won London the right to host the 30th Games. The mayor of Beijing handed the Olympic flag via Rogge to the mayor of London, who failed to drop it and, as he left the podium, indulged in a decorous orgy of mutual celebration with the British athletes while they donned their pink \"See you in London\" jackets.</p> <p>Cue the double-decker bus - not a Routemaster but a cunning replica - with Hoy, Jamie Staff and Victoria Pendleton, all gold medal winners, cycling around it like a couple of London commuters. When the doors opened a file of dancing hoodies, crossing attendants, handicapped people, binge-drinkers and schoolgirls emerged, before the sides of the bus opened out to become a piece of suburban topiary from which Lewis ascended on a lift to sing Whole Lotta Love with guitar accompaniment from the venerable Page. They were joined by a cellist, a violinist and a tracksuited Beckham, who punted a football into the crowd - a bit of a slice, one thought, perhaps into row Z - before the sequence ended in a bit of business with illuminated umbrellas and the stately withdrawal of the bus. Remarkable.</p> <p>And then the hosts regained control. With the aid of a vast human pyramid and a couple of actors standing at the top of a giant airport jetway, the flame went out, ending a Games in which, to freely adapt a thought from Rogge's speech, the world looked at China, China looked at the world, and both sides drew their own conclusions.</p>",
  "<p>Like so many modern conflicts, the hallmark of the latest war in Georgia is that civilians have borne the brunt of the fighting.</p> <p>At the outset of this war, the Georgian military used indiscriminate and disproportionate force resulting in civilian deaths in South Ossetia. The Russian military has since used indiscriminate force in attacks in South Ossetia and in the Gori district, and has <a href=\" http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/16/group-accuses-russia-of-using-cluster-bombs/\">apparently targeted</a> convoys of civilians, killing and wounding them as they have attempted to flee the conflict zones. </p> <p>In parts of Georgia currently under Russian control, ongoing looting, arson attacks, and abductions by militia are <a href=\" http://hrw.org/\">terrorising</a> the civilian population, forcing them to flee their homes and preventing displaced people from returning home. </p> <p>Now that the shooting war <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/georgia.russia2\">is over</a>, there is an urgent need for the deployment of an international security mission to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home. </p> <p>Protection of civilians is not only a good in itself, but can also help to prevent recurring attacks that could reignite a conflict in which \u2013 as the recent heated rhetoric in Washington, Moscow and European capitals indicates \u2013 there is much more at stake than the future of a couple of Russian backed separatist enclaves in Georgia. </p> <p>A civilian protection mission in Georgia is a job well suited for the European Union. Led by France, EU diplomats and politicians have already shown initiative by <a href=\"http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/en/information/latest_news_97/nicolas_sarkozy_brokers_agreement_60816.html\">brokering a ceasefire</a>. They should now follow that up by immediately starting work on the swift deployment of a civilian protection mission that may well help that ceasefire stick.</p> <p>In the past half decade the EU has deployed almost 20 missions under its European security and defence policy (ESDP). These have included full-blown military operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Bosnia, border-monitoring operations in Moldova and on the Gaza/Egypt border, ceasefire monitoring in Aceh in Indonesia, \"security sector reform\" missions in the Balkans, West Bank, Iraq and Afghanistan, and a civilian protection mission in Chad. In 2004, Brussels even despatched a civilian ESDP mission to Georgia to help the Georgian government to strengthen the rule of law.</p> <p>An ESDP mission has three obvious advantages in the current crisis in Georgia. First, it is easier and faster to deploy than a UN mission: time is of the essence in the current crisis. Second, it is not threatening and therefore stands a chance of being accepted by the Russians. In this context it should be made clear that any European deployment would have limited aims: it would most definitely not aim to take over from the existing peacekeeping arrangements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia but would assist Russia to withdraw in an orderly manner from those areas it agreed to withdraw from under the latest ceasefire agreement. Third, the EU is now reasonably experienced in the areas of \"soft security\" \u2013 border monitoring, policing and police training, civilian protection, strengthening rule of law \u2013 that an ESDP mission is likely to have to deal with in Georgia.</p> <p>Remove the cold war rhetoric from the equation and it is quite possible that the Russian government, having made its point to Georgia and to the world, actually now has a political interest in withdrawing from the areas of Georgia its forces have occupied over the past couple of weeks. But Georgian security capacities have been squashed and there are real questions about how to manage such a withdrawal without jeopardising the safety of civilians, and how to allow the swift and safe return of those who have been displaced to their homes.</p> <p>A limited ESDP civilian protection mission would address those questions, boost the confidence of civilian populations on both sides of the conflict, and help the Russians to honour their agreement to withdraw. </p> <p>But the EU needs to move fast at a number of levels to make it happen. It needs to work round the clock diplomatically to persuade the Russians that such a mission is in Russia's interests as well as Georgia's and the EU's. It needs to design a concept of operations for what will be one of the EU's most ambitious, high profile and multifaceted ESDP mission thus far. And it needs to pull together the military, police and logistical personnel required for such a force.</p> <p>If it worked, an ESDP mission in Georgia mandated to protect civilians would be a huge feather in the EU's cap, a validation of its \"soft power\" approach to foreign affairs and conflict management, as well as a service to the thousands of civilians who have already suffered so terribly in this conflict and who badly need the EU's protection.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BBC Worldwide</strong> has come under attack for being \"out of control\" in the expansion of its business interests, highlighted by the \u00a375m deal with travel publisher <strong>Lonely Planet</strong>, from an Edinburgh TV festival panel including Time Out founder <strong>Tony Elliott</strong>.</p> <p>Elliott, <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Media/documents/2008/08/27/TonyElliott2.pdf\">who has written a letter to the Office of Fair Trading</a> over the Lonely Planet deal, said that his company's own discussions about partnering to licence content online stalled because BBC Worldwide wanted \"to own us\". </p> <p>\"Imagine how irritated I was to say the least when they purchased Lonely Planet,\" he said. \"The Lonely Planet deal could be a deal too far for BBC Worldwide. It has nothing to do with the core business of BBC Worldwide as far as I can tell.\"</p> <p>He also questioned about whether the BBC Trust lacked teeth in governing BBC Worldwide's ambitions.</p> <p>\"Are they paying attention and being rigorous enough with some of these deals. In our investigations of the LP [Lonely Planet] transaction, frankly, today we remain convinced this hasn't been scrutinised to the level of detail, and certainly not publicly, as it should be,\" Elliott said.</p> <p>He claimed that letters sent under the freedom of information act by Penguin, publisher of Rough Guide and Eyewitness, had not received responses of \"substance\" six months after they were sent to the BBC Trust.</p> <p>\"Pathetic really for a public entity,\" Elliott said, arguing that BBC Worldwide's digital ambitions behind the Lonely Planet deal would scupper Time Out.</p> <p>\"You have to assume there will be distortion in the marketplace and people like us haven't got a prayer of competing,\" he added.</p> <p>One of the main thrusts of the criticism in the Edinburgh session, which also came from Wall to Wall chief executive <strong>Alex Graham</strong>, was the commercial threat posed by BBC Wordwide's move into areas such as launching production companies and buying publishers.</p> <p>\"It is the cultural version of sub prime lending,\" said Wall, commenting on the brand risk the corporation was taking investing in unproven production start-ups to make programming.</p> <p>\"Is it going to come back and bite the BBC not just financially but reputationally?\" he asked. \"It [could] take just one serious fuck up for the BBC brand to be seriously damaged. The organisation is in danger of getting out of control.\"</p> <p>However, <strong>David Moody</strong>, director of strategy at BBC Worldwide, said that a lot of the criticism that was directed at the corporation's commercial arm was \"long on rhetoric and self interest and short on fact\".</p> <p>Moody added that the organisation had only made a few small investments in production companies. \"The idea that we are distorting the market is an absurd one,\" he said.</p> <p>BBC Worldwide ploughed \u00a3150m back into the core public service part of the corporation and its business interests were \"absolutely in tune with BBC values\", according to Moody.</p> <p>He claimed that there was \"clear blue water\" between the commercial operation and the licence fee-funded BBC that was \"rigorously policed\" and \"well enforced\".</p> <p>Moody said that BBC Worldwide's core function was to exploit BBC intellectual property or, such as in the case of Lonely Planet, go into areas that \"pull BBC IP with it\".</p> <p>For Lonely Planet that meant melding 2,000 hours of relevant \"under exploited\" programming with the travel publisher's brand.</p> <p>Asked what he would like to see happen to BBC Worldwide, Elliott responded that the \"broadcasting side\" should go back into the corporation, with other operations sold off.</p>",
  "<p>There's a favoured argument among track and field fans that claims that medals in the sport are the hardest to win at any Olympics, because it is the most international of all the events. It is an argument that has been convenient for UK Athletics on a number of occasions, when all the circumstantial evidence, like the paucity of medals won, had suggested that the sport has underperformed. In Beijing, it has been heard quite often.</p> <p>But how true is it? The 200-odd federations that comprise the International Association of Athletic Federations include plenty of countries who, to be blunt, are not competitive at the Games: Afghanistan, Guinea-Bissau, Kiribati and American Samoa all had athletes in the men's 100m, for example. Did they make it harder for Simeon Williamson, Craig Pickering and Tyrone Edgar? No, not really. Shanahan Sanitoa, of American Samoa, finished last in his heat in 12.60 seconds. Even Williamson and Pickering, who didn't have the best of times in Beijing, could handle that sort of opposition.</p> <p>Defining what is competitive is an imprecise science. In a more perfect world, we would probably say that the top eight in each event defines competitiveness, and we would total up the nations of those athletes. But it is Sunday, the Games are winding down, and if there's any chance of catching the flight home, we need a statistical shorthand. So let's advance this hypothesis: if we take the number of nations in the athletics medal table, 42, and divide it by the number of medals, 141 (47 events), we get a coefficient that tells us roughly the chance of any of the competitive nations winning a medal, assuming they were all equal.</p> <p>Well, the coefficient for athletics is 3.357 and the number of medals for the British team is four. If we divide the second figure by the first, we get what we could call a strike rate. For athletics, the strike rate is 1.192. Apply the same formula to the other major British sports, and we get a figure of 1.235 for swimming, 2.857 for rowing, 3.273 for sailing and 5.185 for cycling. The higher the strike rate, of course, the better the team's performance.</p> <p>But these figures don't take into account the colour of the medal won. If we do that, by giving gold an arbitrary value of four, silver two and bronze one, we get the following figures: athletics is 2.681 (nine divided by 3.357); swimming 2.882; rowing 6.667; sailing 10.366 and cycling 15.556. The gap is getting larger.</p> <p>We haven't done with figures yet, though, for there is one more very important ingredient that must go in the mix. Athletics and rowing receive roughly the same grant from UK Sport - an average of \u00a36.5m over the past four years - sailing, swimming and cycling marginally less. But athletics has a huge financial advantage over the other four sports in that it generates very considerable sums through television and sponsorship deals. British Athletics receives \u00a38.5m per year from Norwich Union, now branded as Aviva; from McCain another \u00a31m; and from television sales, including the BBC contract (which expires in December), almost another \u00a38m. The annual revenue for UK Athletics is currently at about \u00a325m and dwarfs the income of the other four sports.</p> <p>The richest of Britain's Olympic sports has one of the poorest Olympic returns. How has that come about? Well, it's not rocket science. To appoint one senior executive without a background in the sport could be seen as careless. To appoint two is serious negligence. To appoint three is so far off the scale of logicality that it makes string theory look simple.</p> <p>UK Athletics' performance director, Dave Collins, was a psychologist. The chief executive, Niels de Vos, came in from Sale Sharks rugby union club, and the chairman, Ed Warner, is a city businessman who jogs. Jogging is a flourishing sport, but talk to any of the luminaries who graced British athletics in the 70s and 80s - Brendan Foster, Steve Cram and Ian Stewart for starters - and they will tell about generations of serious athletes, who you would see every night on the streets of the north-east and the midlands, and who formed the backbone of Britain's competing athletics teams. It's joggers you see out on the streets now, and joggers don't produce Olympic champions.</p> <p>The Dwain Chambers affair illustrates how misplaced the ideas of Collins, de Vos and Warner are. The issues surrounding the case were straightforward: Chambers had taken banned drugs, served a two-year ban under the rules of the sport, and returned to the track to compete.</p> <p>Even though his first race back was in 2006, de Vos decided that he didn't want Chambers in the Olympic trials, and naively went public with the fact. When it soon became apparent that de Vos could not stop him from competing, you might have thought that the chief executive would have been suitably chastened. But no, the witch-hunt was only beginning.</p> <p>Many would argue that there is a legitimate case for extending the current ban, but lobbying the relevant bodies is the way forward, pillorying an athlete is not. The Chambers affair dragged on through the summer, monopolised the headlines, and for a variety of reasons, left an unpleasant aftertaste. One was left to wonder whether a white, female, middle-class distance runner would be held up to such public and persistent reprobation if she had tested positive and served her ban. The most distasteful moment of the summer came when, as Chambers received his medal for winning the Olympic trials, the single voice booing belonged to the press officer of UK Athletics, Chris Broadbent, who was sitting next to this correspondent.</p> <p>The Chambers issue has not gone away. Should the sprinter choose to make a more timely appeal to the courts, the judgment of Justice Mackay implies that he could be successful. If UK Athletics gets dragged back in that mire, it will only be a retrograde step.</p> <p>The vital issue is to get the sport into some sort of shape before the London Games. There's an enormous amount of work to be done and only four years to do it. To date, UK Athletics has given no indication that they are capable of taking the sport forward and Collins must be the most vulnerable performance director in the Olympic sports. Time is running out.</p>",

Something highly unusual follows seconds later, however, as Deco misplaces a pass. \"I like that Best Midfield in World Football tag,: yahoos Matt Ayre. \"We could make it into an acronym \u2013 BMWF - pronounced \"bum-woof.\" You might be barking up the wrong tree with that one, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wigan 0-1 Chelsea (Deco 4') C</strong></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Despite vigorous tacking from Wigan. particulaly Palacios, Chelsea are already pinging the ball around with impressive fluidityt. at least they were until Cattermole clattered into Anelka and conceded a freekick ... that Deco curled superbly into the top corner from 25 yards!</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Encouraging riposte from Wigan as Palacios battles past Bonsingwa and unleashes a powerful shot at Cech from a tight angle. The keeper can only push it behind for a corner. . \"How come no big club (nor even Everton) has come in for Wilson Palacios?\" demands to know Gary Naylor. \"I'd be happy to see him at Goodison.\" You're unlikely to see the excellent Honduran at Goodison, Gary, since it seems Everton are trying to develop an ambitious new midfielderless formation ...</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> More bright stuff from Wigan, as Koumas slips a neat ball through to Zaki, who lets fire from the edge of the box. Cech saves with his feet and Heskey narrowly fails to latch on to the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> It's richly entertaining game so far with both sides attacking skillfully. The only annoying thing is that the lack of a lull is stopping me from hurrying to my Fantasy Football team to bring in Deco before his value soars even higher. Time for David Bentley to be ditched like a nagging girlfriend.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min: </strong>Even Bramble is getting into the groove! The legend just hurtled down the left wing, past Bosingwa, and delivered a fine centre that brave Terry headed clear without so much as a whimper.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Terry booked for hauling back Heskey. Yet still he fights back the tears! Meanwhile, Palacios nearly confounds Cech with a sneaky lob from 20 yards. He missed by millimetres, albeit several hundred of them.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min: </strong> Chelsea, who've been under a surprising amount of pressure since taking the lead, win a corner. Lampard totters over to take it and endure the boos of the home crowd. Bramble butts his delivery clear. Ish. It come straight back into the Wigan box and Cattermole is obliged to divert it behind for another corner. This time the Carvahlo meets Lampard's cross but can only head it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Chelsea are re-asserting their supremacy now, and Joe Cole forces yet another corner. Deco takes it this time, but Bramble again clears.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Ashley Cole's finding plenty of space on the left but using it terribly, consistently failing to beat the first man with his crosses. Wigan's left-back, meanwhile, is showing himself to be both a demonic defender and a menacing attacker: you'll hear more of this Figueroa chap, be sure of that.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Ridiculous effort from Ashley Cole, who blazes an attempted shot out for a throw-in on the far side, offering the most absurd piece of inaccuracy since the ventriloquist who threw his voice and lost it amid undergrowth.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> More cunning play from creator-in-chief ... TiItus Bramble! His deft through-ball to Heskey was knocked sideways to Zaki, who drew another impressive save from Cech.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Wigan's smart and pacy attacking is forcing Essien further and further back to the point that he's now basically a third centreback. Yet when Chelsea have the ball, they too launch forward with speed and verve, which is why this is such an engrossing spectacle. A Wigan equaliser is certainly not out of the question - Cech has been busier than Pollit and Anelka has seen less of the ball than Heskey and Zaki at the other end.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Palacios eanrs a rapturous ovation from the crowd after consecutive crunching challenges on Bosingwa and Anelka.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Palacios barges into Bosingwa to concede a free-kick near the edge of the area. THe angle is probably too acute for Deco to score again, so Ashley Cole floats it into to Anelka instead, and the Frenchman nods it over the bar. \"You seem obsessed with John Terry and his tears,\" sniffs Michael H. \"You're not one of those men who believes crying is for 'girls', are you?\" Not necessarily, Michael, I just think there's a time and place for crying. A football pitch? No. A bar? Maybe. A cinema when Watership Down is being screened? Certainly.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Figueroa flings a long thrown into the six-yard box and Cech rises above Heskey - with considerable difficulty - to punch the ball.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Lampard lets the ball run over his foot and out for a throw-in: Wigan's fair ferocity has so far forced many such errors from, ahem, the best midfield in the world.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> After a snappy Chelsea move Anelka tricks past Melchiot and into the box. As Bramble comes across to tackle, Anelka twists pasts him too ... and then goes down. No penalty, waves the ref, and the replays confirm he was right.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Deco picks out Bosingwa in an advanced position on the right and the right-back again feints past his man and into the box \u2026 but again his shot is weak Wigan charge up the other end and Zaki threads the ball through to Heskey, who turns past Terry \u2026 and then just keeps turning, rendering himself so dizzy that Terry recovers and strips him of the ball.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> That was fun. Chelsea have been classy in patches but Wigan have perhaps been better, with the likes of Palacios and Zaki showing that lavish spending can buy you everything but the sort of bargains the Latics have landed.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Wigan substitution: De Ridder on for Koumas. With the new arrival heading for the left flank, Valencia switches to the right.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Ropey backpass from Cattermole gives something for Anelka to chase, but Pollitt surges out of his box to welly it clear.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Essien wasn't supposed to last beyond half-time and now perhaps he wishes he hadn't - because Cattermole has just clobbered him with a late tackle that is justly punished with a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> A rather aimless start to the second period, with Wigan failing to regain the vibrancy they showed in the first half and Chelsea seemingly happy to play at a slower tempo, even though it hasn't helped them find greater crispness in their passing.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Ballack slips a lovely ball through to Lampard, whose cross is deflected out for a corner, which is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Chelsea have monopolised possession for the last few minutes but because Wigan are doing what Pompey failed so wretchedly to do last week, they're having difficulty carving out openings.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Figeuroa forces a corner with another of his unfeasibly long throw-ins (which Bosingwa headed behind). It's wasted - Lamparditis is catching.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> I wouldn't say Joe Cole has been anonymous this afternoon - his name is still Joe Cole - but he has been virtually invisible. Scolari has at last managed to spot him and haul him off, introducing Salamon Kalou in his place.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> A wild cross from Deco gets caught by a gust of wind and is carried towards Lampard at the edge of the six-yard box. HE declines to head it, electing instead to attempt \u2026 well, what was he attempting? The ball bounced off his foot and dropped 15 yards wide of the goal.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> After a strange period of nothingness, Wigan win a corner. De Ridder's delivery is caught by Cech. That is all.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> The game has gone flatter than the earth in the 15th century. Essien fails to lift the tempo with a humdrum shot from 30 yards that rolls into Pollitt's arms.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> It looked effortless, but Chelsea slowly, methodically opened up Wigan and Essien served Lampard with a low cut-back from the right. A splendid tackle by Cattermole thwarts Lampard just as he was winding up a shot from 10 yards.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Gradually Chelsea have returned to the team of last season, exerting control without any sparkle. Wigan's resistance is waning because they can't get as much of the ball as they had in the first half, yet their ambition remains intact and if Chelsea don't nab a second, an equaliser is always possible.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Carvahlo booked for being in the vicinity of a Zaki fall.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Terry blocks a Palacios shot. \"Five Live are taking Steve Bruces tracksuit bottoms to task,\" reveals Adi Bloomfield-Proust. \"That seems a lot more interesting then what is happening on the pitch.\" I haven't noticed his legwear, Adi, but I'm thankful he is at least wearing some.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Zaki, who has been highly impressive today, charges past Essien and Carvahlo before winning a corner that Terry nods clear.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> After De Ridder hits the corner flag with a shot, Olivier Kapo is introduced in place of Palacios who, like the match, has run out of steam.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Kalou and Anelka exchange a tidy one-two before Bramble bounds across to tip the ball behind for a corner. Before it can be taken, Wayne Bridhe comes on for Ashley Cole, who has picked up an injury and limps of looking very sorry for himself. Terry courageously refrains from weeping. Lampard and Deco then muck up a short corner.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Wigan are going gung-ho: Melchiot is withdrawn for Henri Camara.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Wigan almost snatch the equalizer! But Cech dived low to push Kapo's drilled 20-yard drive behind. And then rises well to claim the corner too.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Malouda on for Anelka as mighty Chelsea shut up shop.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> As the clock ticks into time added on, Wigan win a free-kick on the brink of the box. Kapo celebrates by smashing it straight into the wall. \"On the radio Matt Jackson said that haranguing referees was part of the profession and driven by players desire to win\" blurts Stve Peake. \"I think it's more likely that the likes of Terry and Cashley are believers in Tony Blair's notion of meritocracy and think that because they are considerably richer than referees their opinions should carry more weight.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+ 4min:</strong> It's officially all over, though really the game ended at half-time. \"After two games Steve Bruce is pointless,\" says Setanta's commentator, which is a bit harsh. Joe Cole and Frank Lampard - now there are two people who were pointless today.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Ahoy there! Welcome to a seaside-themed European grand prix at Spain's spanking new Valencia street circuit. It's not quite Monaco (fewer yachts, less money and \u2013 wow \u2013 a bridge that's been welded down) but it's great to see an addition to the calendar that is in the heartland of formula one, rather than it's newer and wealthier outposts.</p> <p>So, the title battle is as hot as ever, with Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Felipe Massa all slugging it out \u2013 and Robert Kubica not out of the equation either. Luckily for us, this is set to be one of the more unpredictable races of the season. A new track always brings an extra challenge for the teams, with no previous data to work with, and a street circuit promises wall-skimming, safety-car inducing madness. Some unusual names were troubling the title contenders during practice and qualifying, although they didn't make it into the top four slots. Let's remind ourselves of the grid:</p> <p>1 Felipe Massa, Ferrari<br>2 Lewis Hamilton, McLaren<br>3 Robert Kubica, BMWSauber<br>4 Kimi Raikkonen, Ferrari<br>5 Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren<br>6 Sebastien Vettel, Toro Rosso<br>7 Jarno Trulli, Toyota<br>8 Nick Heidfeld, BMWSauber<br>9 Nico Rosberg, Williams<br>10 Sebastian Bourdais, Toro Rosso<br>11 Kazuki Nakajima, Williams<br>12 Fernando Alonso, Renault<br>13 Timo Glock, Toyota<br>14 Mark Webber, Red Bull<br>15 Nelson Piquet, Renault<br>16 Jenson Button, Honda<br>17 David Coulthard, Red Bull<br>18 Giancarlo Fisichella, Force India<br>19 Rubens Barrichello, Honda<br>20 Adrian Sutil, Force India</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Predictions: </strong>Practice and qualifying all passed by without a major shunt \u2013 but are we looking at a pile-up in the opening few laps? Possibly. Some drivers have said the corners are all blind, we know there's next to no run-off and there's some names in the top ten of the grid that we weren't expecting to see. The GP2 races had their fair share of crumpled carbon fibre too, so the formula one team strategists will have had their thinking caps on deciding how to build in the probability of a safety car.</p> <p>The chances of the top four all having an incident-free race are certainly not 100 per cent \u2013 but Massa will be hoping he used up his bad luck in the last race, when his engine blew while he was leading with just three laps to go. Hamilton also had a small grey cloud hovering over his head in Hungary, with a puncture dropping him down the order, while Raikkonen still hasn't managed to get the edge on his team-mate in qualifying. None of these three appear to be completely on song, but Massa looks like a good bet for victory if he doesn't get tangled in any collisions.</p> <p>One man to keep your eye on is Sebastien Vettel. The baby-faced German set the fastest time in a practice session and in Q2 yesterday. He's quick, by god, and he's wound-up Red Bull's Mark Webber who feels that Toro Rosso's Ferrari engine is better than his own Renault. He is eight places behind Vettel, so you can feel his frustration.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>ITV's </strong>super commentator Louise Goodman has discovered a grid guy standing in front of Jenson Button's car. Equality at last for formula one's grid-number-holders! Except he wasn't in a lycra suit.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The weather</strong> looks very fine in the Spanish port, which was once home to the America's Cup yachting extravaganza. Some dark skies had threatened yesterday's qualifying session, although they did not amount to more than a few drops. It appears that today's race will be fair. Nice weather for seagulls... apart from the one that was laid to rest by Nelson Piquet's car yesterday.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Adrian Sutil</strong> of Force India will be starting from the pit lane. it's a shame - he did so well in the Monaco grand prix, but his last-place qualifying slot yesterday means he won't be troubling the top ten here.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Start:</strong> Here we go... Massa into lead and Kubica pressuring Hamilton but he holds the BMW at bay. Most cars appeared to make it through safely.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Lap one:</strong> Kovalainen made it past Raikkonen at the start. So the front runners are Massa from Hamilton, Kubica, Kovalainen and Raikkonen. Nakajima lost his nose when he bumped Alonso from behind. Poor Alonso, his Renault is being pushed into the garage minus a rear wing. All those locals will be gutted. They may get him out again. He'll be hoping for a long safety car period.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Lap three:</strong> Hamilton has set the fastest lap. Coulthard was spun around in the first lap, compounding a difficult weekend for the Scot, who didn't even make it through to Q2.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Lap four:</strong> Massa's lead over Hamilton is just under two seconds. Raikkonen, in fifth, is almost seven seconds behind his team-mate. Vettel is holding his own in sixth, ahead of Trulli. Alonso has now got out of his car, to the dismay of the fans.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Lap six:</strong> Massa is slowly building his lead over Hamilton. Recent star Timo Glock, in the Toyota, made three places at the start of the race and lies tenth. Coulthard has passed Piquet and is in 16th, behind Sutil. The Force India driver appears to be angrily shouting to his engineer over the radio that he needs to pass team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella who is directly ahead. Calm down dear, it's only the opening few laps. This is a long race.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Lap eight:</strong> Coulthard, unsighted, has come together with Sutil. The Red Bull spins but keeps going, minus a small piece of carbon fibre. Sutil will be fuming even more, though his progress shouldn't have been hampered too much.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Rustum Kozain</strong> has emailed from Cape Town to say that the GU lap-by-lap combined with the excellent live timing screens on the <a href=\"http://www.formula1.com\">official f1 website</a> are almost as good as having TV. Jeez, thanks Rustum. What else can I do to help build your image of the new circuit? Well, picture lots of catch fencing, some walls, some bikini-clad babes frolicking in the sea.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Lap 11:</strong> Looks like Kubica is having problems and his pit crew may be preparing to do some repairs. He's fallen to 13 secs behind Massa, which is holding up Raikkonen, Vettel and Trulli behind - but giving us a nice battle to watch out for.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Sutil </strong>may be a little happier now he's past his team-mate and running in 14th place.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Lap 14: </strong>Hamilton is now about five seconds adrift of Massa, who looks ominously strong. We had hoped that there would be some opportunities for overtaking here, but Raikkonen cannot find any way past Kovalainen ahead. The Ferrari driver will once again be kicking himself (not literally, there isn't enough room in the cockpit) for not qualifying higher.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Lap 15:</strong> The Ferrari mechanics are out and Massa is in for his first stop. That'll please Hamilton, it means the McLaren had more fuel in qualifying. The stop goes well and Massa comes out behind Kovalainen and ahead of his team-mate! Why hasn't he let Raikkonen through? Oooh, bad strategy call from Ferrari.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Lap 16:</strong> Hamilton is absolutely flying. Like a greyhound released from the trap. or something. He's broken the 1min38sec barrier. When will he be pitting?</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Lap 17:</strong> McLaren's silver-clad pit crew are out and the Brit is in. Short and sweet stop. He comes out behind both Ferraris. Massa is still ahead of Raikkonen.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Lap 18: </strong>Kubica has pitted, so too Raikkonen. Both stops went smoothly and Kovalainen now leads. It's still a surprise that we've not seen a safety car yet; the race has been extremely clean and Alonso remains as the only retirement.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Paul Ferrari</strong> has emailed to ask whether Massa stayed ahead of Raikkonen to ensure that he would remain at the head of the field and with the advantage over Hamilton when the stops shake out. That sounds like a good bet. Perhaps Massa also sees himself as Ferrari's best chance of claiming the world championship and in his head he's the team's number one, unwilling to move over for anyone.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Lap 21:</strong> Kovalainen has now pitted and now lies fourth behind Massa, Hamilton and Kubica. Frontrunners Heidfeld and Glock - in fifth and sixth - have yet to stop. Dare we say it's looking a bit predictable up front? That was the last thing we'd envisaged!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Lap 25:</strong> Hamilton continues to give away precious tenths of a second to Massa and is now just over five seconds behind. Michael Schumacher is nodding his approval from the pit wall. I wonder what safety car driver Bernd Maylander is up to? Having a kip? Playing tiddlywinks?</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>So, readers,</strong> what do you make of the Valencia circuit? I'm a bit disappointed, truth be told. Precious little overtaking, backdrop of apartment blocks and cranes, grandstands punctuated by empty seats (not sure whether they were occupied until Alonso went out or not). The red-yellow-blue paintwork on the kerbs is excellent, however, and very distinctive.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Lap 29: </strong>One-stopping Glock still hasn't stopped. Arnoux has emailed (Rene, is that you?) to ponder why Raikkonen always performs poorly when Schumacher is around. As he puts it, quick drivers don't forget how to be fast. Mais oui, Rene.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>And the latest excitement:</strong> Webber over-shot his pit marker.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Lap 31:</strong> Glock has pitted, at last, and rejoins ahead of Heidfeld in ninth. Further up the field, Trulli passed Vettel for sixth in the first round of stops.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Lap 33: </strong>Coulthard has pitted again. Gavin, from Wales, says the grand prix is boring and he wants a crash. 'Where's Ralf Schumacher when you need him,\" he asks. Probably at home enjoying some bratwurst and mustard.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Gary Naylor emails:</strong> \"Never mind Valencia, since we no longer have the Nurburgring nor Spa, not to mention Zandvoort nor Brands, aren't all the circuits rubbish?\" But Gary, we do have Spa! Just wait a couple of weeks, until 7 September. I agree about Zandvoort though - another seaside special, but with more character than Valencia. You have to love a circuit with a corner named Tarzan.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Lap 35: </strong>Massa continues to lead, and set fastest laps, and is all but 10 seconds ahead of Hamilton. The Britain will be wondering what he can possibly do to win this race - or has he given up and settled for second already? Kubica appears to have got over his earlier problems, while Kovalainen is keeping Raikkonen in check behind him.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Lap 37:</strong> Massa pits and is released by the lollipop man at the same time as Sutil's Force India and they narrowly escape clashing. Phew! But Massa may find himself with a penalty for driving away when there was another car passing...</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Daryl Hendricks</strong> asks why Massa is so much quicker than Hamilton. One theory is that the five helpings of shepard's pie he ate last night have given him the edge. Another is that the Ferrari works its tyres better in hot conditions than the McLarens.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lap 39:</strong> Hamilton has pitted and managed not to kiss another car in the pitlane. Massa, meanwhile, is under investigation after his stop. Hamilton rejoins ahead of Kubica, who has yet to take a second pit, protecting his second place. Or could that become first, if Massa gets a drive-through..?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Lap 41: </strong>Kubica has pitted. Vettel's stop, a couple of laps ago, has kept him ahead of Glock. No word yet on whether leader Massa will get a wrap on the knuckles from the men in blue.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Lap 43: </strong>Sutil is out, nudged up against a tyre wall with broken suspension Arnoux says this GP is dull and backs-up Gary Naylor's comments. He adds the Osterreichring to the list of great tracks we'd like to see. But, Rene, what about Dijon?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Lap 44:</strong> Disaster! Raikkonen tried to exit the pits with his fuel hose still connected. A mechanic is down and is being attended to by a doctor - he appeared to catch his head on the wheel. The reigning world champion has now lost a place to Trulli. </p> <p>The stewards have announced that Massa's pit-lane incident will be investigated after the race.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Jeanette Ramsaroop</strong> wants an update on homeboy Alonso. My guess: he's sipping sangria in the Renault motorhome. Sorry Jeanette, he went out on the first lap with a broken rear wing. Blame Kazuki Nakajima.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lap 46: </strong>Raikkonen's engine has blown up and he's now retired from sixth place. So no points for the reigning world champion. Things go from bad to worse for Ferrari and not just in this race. Two engine failures from two races will have the Scuderia big wigs sobbing into their chianti.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>When the flag</strong> falls on this race, will we know who the winner is? What kind of penalty could Massa be facing? It seems like a very strange decision by the race stewards to delay this investigation. One can only guess that there is information they need that is not readily available.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Lap 49: </strong> Massa - who could be facing a grid place penalty in the next race - leads from Hamilton, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Glock, Rosberg, Heidfeld and Bourdais in the top ten. If the order stays like that this will be a great race for Toyota and Toro Rosso teams.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Lap 52:</strong> Will there be any changes in position in these final few laps? Hamilton is almost seven seconds adrift of Massa, so there should be no challenge there. Kovalainen is four secs away from Kubica, with a similar gap between Trulli and Vettel.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Paul Ferrari </strong>thinks the stewards have it wrong if Massa gets penalised for his pit lane near-miss and Raikkonen receives no penalty for his drama. The difference is that Massa clearly broke a rule, regardless of the outcome. Raikkonen's incident was unfortunate, but was not done on purpose. Unless there's a rule: 'thou shalt not drive over your crew'.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>The flag:</strong> Felipe Massa has dominated this race and now he takes the victory - which will go some way to making up for his disappointment in the last race. But will it be bittersweet? That's for the stewards to decide. Hamilton is second, but thanks to Raikkonen's misfortune his championship lead is extended by a point. Kubica takes his sixth podium finish.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>What it means: </strong> Massa's win has moved him into second place in the drivers' title standings. Hamilton leads on 70 points, over Massa on 64 and Raikkonen on 57... with Kubica just two points adrift from the trio. A superb performance from Vettel nets him sixth place, while Rosberg steals a rare point for Williams in eighth. There's unfinished business, however, and we await the outcome of the stewards' investigation into Massa's second pit stop.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>The order</strong> in which the finishers crossed the line:</p> <p>1 Felipe Massa, Ferrari<br>2 Lewis Hamilton, McLaren<br>3 Robert Kubica, BMWSauber<br>4 Heikki Kovalainen, McLaren<br>5 Jarno Trulli, Toyota<br>6 Sebastien Vettel, Toro Rosso<br>7 Timo Glock, Toyota<br>8 Nico Rosberg, Williams<br>9 Nick Heidfeld, BMWSauber<br>10 Sebastian Bourdais, Toro Rosso<br>11 Nelson Piquet, Renault<br>12 Mark Webber, Red Bull<br>13 Jenson Button, Honda<br>14 Giancarlo Fisichella, Force India<br>15 Kazuki Nakajima, Williams<br>16 Rubens Barrichello, Honda<br>17 David Coulthard, Red Bull<br>DNF Kimi Raikkonen, Ferrari<br>DNF Adrian Sutil, Force India<br>DNF Fernando Alonso, Renault</p> <p>Thanks for reading. Join us for the next grand prix, at Spa Francorchamps, on 7 September.</p>",
  "<p>\"Hey Joe,\" Jimi Hendrix <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_Joe\">bellowed in 1966</a>, instantly blighting the lives of people called Joseph for decades to come: \"Where you goin' with that gun in your hand?!\" </p> <p>Had Joe been a 27-year-old megalomaniacal rock star instead of a jealous fictional lunatic, he'd probably have replied, \"I'm off to extinguish my life before I hit 28, just like you and scores of other drug-addled musicians.

You had a one-year-old daughter!\" Instead, it boasted a poster advertising \"rock 'n' roll's most infamous members' club\", lamenting that the Famous Five were \"ill-fated stars whose lives have been tragically cut short at the age of 27\", as though they were all killed when a freak piece of errant scaffolding fell on their heads, instead of self-destructing by shovelling drugs into their own mouths and gulping.</p> <p>Still, if they'd been mistakenly decapitated, cruelly obliterated by a flying stapler or hit by a dustcart aged 83 after living long, enjoyable lives, they probably wouldn't be as \"iconic\", and Proud wouldn't be able to flog their photos for up to \u00a3950. Death and youth sell, especially when you tie a group of early deaths together in an apparently eerie, \"much-mythologised\" way. \"Does a nihilistic instinct kick in at the age 27?\" the subtext muses. Er, no: I just had a whole year of being 27, and I didn't want to top myself once, but then I didn't spend it wandering around wanky photographic exhibitions. \"Jim Morrison and Brian Jones both spookily died on July 3\" is the other main 27 Club observation. Yeah? Well, I was born on July 3. That's what's known as a coincidence. </p> <p>They aren't the only ones cashing in on the unnecessary 27 Club deaths though: you can also <a href=\"http://www.the27s.com/\">buy a book online</a> about \"the greatest myth of rock 'n' roll\" (interestingly, its blurb fails to mention all the rock stars who also died at 26 and 28) and for a credit-crunching \u00a322, you can buy a 27 Club t-shirt online (modelled <a href=\"http://www.a-non.co.uk/item.php?id=272\">here</a> by some kind of Jesus-Bono hybrid) emblazoned with the five dead club members and a Neil Young lyric misquoted from Cobain's suicide note: \"It's better to burn out rather [sic] than fade away.\" Hmm \u2026 is it really? Wouldn't most people rather live a long and peaceful life than choke on their own acrid carroty vomit barely a third of the way through?</p> <p>Camden is a poor area of London, and there are lots of things it needs, but an exhibition romanticising early drug-related deaths isn't one of them. What it needs far more, in among all its dealers and junkies, is a celebration of life. The space at Proud could be better used to tell the stories of ordinary people who were penniless and anonymous, but still made the very most of every moment instead of obliterating themselves. As Oasis's songwriter Noel Gallagher said of Cobain in the early 1990s: \"Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and was miserable about it. And we had fuck all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever.\" He insisted, \"I can't have people like [Cobain] coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense.\"</p> <p>So he decided to write the upbeat single <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Forever\">Live Forever</a> as an antidote. It was released in 1994, when Gallagher was that most nihilistic of ages: 27.</p>",
  "<p>A 24-year-old man has been shot dead in Birmingham, West Midlands police said today. </p> <p>The man, who has not been named, was shot last night in the Newtown area. He was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.</p> <p>It is the third fatal shooting in the area in less than a year. On March 18 Nehemiah Bryce, 27, of Winson Green, was shot dead a few hundred metres from last night's attack. On December 23 last year, Assar Joseph Mohammed Tomlinson was killed during a row in Newtown.</p> <p>Last night's shooting took place in Hockley Close. A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said they had received a call at 10.13pm.<br> \"An ambulance was on scene within three minutes of the call and was backed up by a rapid response vehicle,\" he said. \"A 24-year-old man was taken on blue lights to City hospital. The paramedic from the response vehicle travelled with the ambulance crew to provide additional assistance as the man was treated en route to hospital. </p> <p>\"Sadly, despite the best efforts of ambulance and hospital staff it was not possible to save the man and he was confirmed dead at hospital.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"We are asking them to give up everything,\" admits Melanie Chowns, her soft voice rising above the hollow chatter of thundersticks at Beijing's National Indoor Stadium. \"It's one thing chasing the Olympic dream, it's quite another moving to Denmark.\"</p> <p>Chowns, the manager of Great Britain's women's handball squad, is outlining her sport's ambitious plans to create men and women's teams strong enough to reach the knockout stages in London 2012 - a huge task for a country that has never played in an Olympic handball tournament and has less than 1,000 registered players.</p> <p>It is, in effect, a great sporting engineering project, involving a nationwide hunt for tall sporty converts, \u00a33.3m of lottery funding over three years and counting, jaw-dropping self sacrifice and, yes, Denmark.</p> <p>For the past 18 months, most of Britain's leading players have been living at the Aarhus Handball Academy, training six hours a day and playing in the national league, one of the strongest in Europe. \"Each player is evaluated every six months and if we decide they're not good enough they're out,\" says performance director Bill Baillie. \"We've never hid it from them. The pressure is always there.\"</p> <p>No one knows this better than Lynn McCafferty, the captain of the women's team. \"I got married last year and my husband plays handball as well,\" she says. \"He had his chance - he was on the programme, got injured and fell back a couple of months, and lost his place. He's now back in our house in Glasgow working in insurance, while I'm in Denmark.\"</p> <p>How does that feel? \"It's very hard,\" she says. \"We've spent the last nine months living apart. But you have to put handball first or you'll never make it.\"</p> <p>Partly because the sporting gene pool exposed to handball is so small, the British Handball Association has been an enthusiastic embracer of UK Sport's various Talent ID programmes for London 2012. Last year's Sporting Giants campaign, which sought tall, athletic types to try out for volleyball, rowing and handball was particularly successful: of the 4,000 applicants, 12 are now training in Denmark in British handball's development programme.</p> <p>\"We sat down with UK Sport and went through the criteria we were looking for,\" explains Chowns. \"Skills in ball sports were desirable, height essential. We were looking for a minimum of 5ft 11in for women and 6ft 6in for men.\" Initially 120 men, mainly from a rugby or basketball background, and 60 women, most of whom played netball, were selected for trials. After a series of physical and aptitude tests, and several camps in the UK and Denmark, eight men and four women accepted offers to move to Denmark full time. \"It was a bit like X-Factor,\" admits Chowns. \"We had all the photos on the wall and debated the rationale behind picking each player.\"</p> <p>One of those who made the grade was 18-year-old Laura Innes, an A-level student who had never played handball in her life until last year. \"I filled in the form on the internet, didn't hear anything for a while, went to my first training session and it all went from there,\" she says. \"London 2012 is always on my mind but there's a long way to go.\"</p> <p>Innes was at these Olympics as part of a six-strong handball team, and a much bigger squad of British development athletes across 33 sports. None of them competed, that wasn't the point. Instead they spent a week in Macau and Beijing as part of an immersion programme that the British Olympic Association hopes will help bring medals, rather than stagefright, when these athletes make their Olympic debuts in 2012.</p> <p>Will our handball teams be able to step up? \"Making the knockout stages will certainly be tough,\" says Baillie. \"Our men are probably ranked about 30th in Europe, and the women are there or thereabouts too. But we've made massive strides in the last 18 months; our players are playing in higher divisions in Denmark and they're improving all the time.\"</p> <p>They're still a long way behind the sport's powerhouses - the likes of Germany, Russia, Denmark and France, who beat surprise packages Iceland in the men's final earlier today. But even if British handball crashes and burns in four years' time, Baillie is convinced London 2012 will turn out to be a watershed moment for his sport.</p> <p>\"In the Sydney Olympics, handball was voted the most popular spectator sport,\" he points out. \"But their handball association wasn't ready for the demand that followed. They had one man and a dog in the office and they were getting 6,000 calls a day. They couldn't deal with it and the chance to develop in Australia died.</p> <p>\"We're already putting plans in place to ensure that doesn't happen,\" he adds, voice bristling with determination. \"Take it from me: London 2012 really will bring a legacy for our sport.\"</p>",
  "<p>The President of the International Olympic Committee Jacques Rogge said today that Great Britain's medal success in Beijing has been a powerful boost for the 2012 Games in London, where he expects the host nation will be able to do even better than the 19 golds and 47 total medals that secured fourth place in the medals table.</p> <p>\"The British team is ready and that's important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population,\" Rogge said. \"That has been achieved four years beforehand, and they will be able to improve even on that.\"</p> <p>Rogge warned however that London faces a tough task to match Beijing, which has had spectacular ceremonies, more than a million volunteers, and unprecedented control over areas such as transport, labour, resources and<br>security. \"It's clear that China has put the bar very high and it's going<br>to be a challenge for London and also for all the subsequent Games,\" Rogge said.</p> <p>\"I believe London has unique assets,\" he added. \"Athens was returning to the roots, to the country that invented the Olympic Games. China was the most populous country in the world. London is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport, that has invented the rules of the sports, and the values of fair play.</p> <p>\"It is a cosmopolitan, multi-ethnic and multi-religious city and that's<br>something they can build on. The rest have no concerns. The venues will be fine, the village will be fine, the organisation will be fine.\"</p>",
  "<p>Discriminatory policies against Italy's Romany Gypsy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/race.humanrights\">population</a>, including the fingerprinting of children, are said to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/24/italy.roma\">their origins</a> in the fascist policies of Mussolini. Many were shocked by the apathy shown when two Gypsy girls drowned on a beach near Naples, as people carried on enjoying their day out only yards away, regardless of the small bodies laid out on the sand. But how different is Britain when it comes to prejudice against its own travelling people?</p> <p>According to a report last year from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/14/thegypsyexception\">Children's Society</a>, almost nine out of every 10 children and young people with a Gypsy background have been the victim of racial abuse. The report also stated that nearly two-thirds have been bullied or physically attacked. </p> <p>Few campsites are provided for British Gypsies, and draconian powers allow local authorities to crack down on new encampments. <a href=\"http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/getadvice/advice_topics/eviction/eviction_of_gypsiestravellers/eviction_from_your_own_land\"> Shelter Scotland</a> points out that if you are a Gypsy and you own your own land, you can still be evicted by your local council. Ernie Rutherford, Romany Gypsy and professional boxing trainer, told me:</p> <blockquote> <p>There ain't no life on the road no more. You'll end up living in a house \u2013 that's just the way it is. That's how they're killing it out. They take away our lifestyle and make us fit in with everybody else's \u2026 In the end there won't be no Gypsies \u2013 that's the way it's going. We can't even buy some land and put nothing on it, because they'll bulldoze it down. At the end of the day they don't want to give us nowhere to live, they don't want us to drive about on the road, they don't really want to give us houses.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I ask him whether he thinks Gypsies are discriminated against, he says, \"Yeah, you're not wrong. We're the only people now that you can call pikey and things like that on the telly and get away with it. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6Mnlx-Wxs\"> Catherine Tate</a> takes the piss out of us every week mate.\" This makes me glad that Tate didn't win the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/09/itv.tvfakery?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">British Comedy award</a>.</p> <p>Rutherford grew up in St Mary Cray, in south-east London, which is the largest settled community of Romany Gypsies, or Travellers, in the UK. Like many Gypsies, the Rutherfords lived in pre-fabricated asbestos housing until the site was eventually closed down and they were moved into houses. \"Them houses were the worst houses in the area \u2013 they were dangerous,\" he recalls. Not <em>Kushti Atchin Tan</em>, or a good stopping place, in the Roma language.</p> <p>Ernie tells me how some of his family have had bricks thrown through the windows of their caravans when they've been on the road. \"Some people don't like you in their area, they don't want you there. They look on us as we're the worst kind of people in this country,\" he says. He just wants to be treated with respect. The government does not provide sites for the Travellers, but he would love to buy a plot of land and put a mobile home on it. He accepts that at the moment this is an almost impossible dream. </p> <p>\"If the government can't control ya, then they don't want ya,\" he believes. \"They talk about China and all these places, they're just as bad. They ain't no different, they just do it craftily.\" He complains that there are no schools for Traveller people. \"They're killing our culture that's what they're doing. They're doing it slowly, but they're doing a good job of it.\"</p>",

It starts at noon BST, and all the fun will be peeled off the eight-inch screen of his Tosumi telly in Farringdon, moulded into words, and printed here for your amusement. </p> <p>In the meantime, here's a selection of what other people have been writing on this website in the past day or so:</p> <p>Lord Seb \"Sebastian\" Coe says: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/aug/24/olympics2012.olympics2008\">It's our turn now.</a><br>IOC President Jacques \"Jacques\" Rogge says: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympics20122\">Go ahead, have it, I reckon you'll do a good job.</a><br>Anna Kessel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics\">catches up with Lightning \"Usain\" Bolt</a> and finds out all about the world's fastest jogger.<br>Kevin Mitchell reckons that <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/24/games_for_all_as_britain_shine.html\">all the athletes have done their bit in producing the Beijing experience</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> Simon Wood is feeling the post-Olympic funk: \"I have no idea how I'm going to fill the hours from tomorrow. It's a melancholy feeling akin to coming back from a pleasant holiday.\" Yep, that works. \"Best memories from this games have to be a) The Togo kayaker winning his country's first ever medal, breaking his paddle in half to celebrate b) With all the talk about strength and power, Phelps winning the 100m butterfly by 0.01 seconds on pure technique and c) Lolo Jones being amazingly gracious and philosophical despite crashing out of the Hurdle final.</p> <p>An honourable mention to the Cuba's finest Taekwondo player, whose punishment includes being stricken from the record.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> And with that, the Olympic MBM saga comes to a close. Robin Lynch will be in a shiny new article to describe the closing ceremony and the official handover of the baton to Great Britain. No doubt he'll be watching through his fingers as our bungling blazers drop it to the turf. Thanks for all your emails throughout all these long early mornings. Cheers to all.</p>",

Spain's Rudy Fernandez gets two back and then nails a huge three-pointer. Nothing but net; nothing but net.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>8.07am: </strong>What else is popular on the internet? (Except that.) Anyone got anything to sell? Poker anyone? YouTube clips? File-sharing? We've got a lot of space and a lot of time to fill it. It's 52-42 with five minutes left in the second quarter, incidentally.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>8.03am: Basketball: </strong>Some Globetrottering from Kobe Bryant, who gives the USA a 10-point lead with a near-ally-oop. Then some textbook diva behaviour from Dwight Howard, whose foul gives two free shots to Spain. They miss them both.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>8am: Basketball:</strong> Anyone interested in this mismatch? USA have gone 46-33 up against Spain in the second quarter, although a late comeback from Their Egos could prove the toughest opponents. Oh, it's 46-38 now.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.54am:</strong> I understand this morning's riff is on best Olympic performances, heroic and otherwise, and here's Gary Naylor to stir it up. He rates Bolt over Phelps, which is like saying salt and vinegar over cheese and onion, or the other way round. Here's how he justifies it: \"Fairly or not, we're used to multiple medal winning in the pool, so Bolt's series of performances on the biggest stage stand, like him, head and shoulders over everything else, including Phelps.\" </p> <p>And at the other end, here's more Naylor: \"Elsewhere, Lolo Jones missed a certain gold when hitting the penultimate high hurdle. She stumbled to the finish line, distraught, and then showed great composure in her interviews, acknowledging her rivals' success and her own failure. She didn't get a lot of attention, but she didn't fit the media stereotype of the Team USA sprinter, so they couldn't be bothered reporting her.\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.52am: </strong>Good morning again, sniff, for the final time. I'm going to miss crawling into work in the early hours of the weekend mornings, sharing the streets with stragglers from the London booze and drug scene, to find handball on the telly and a bunch of weirdos in my inbox.</p> <p>But please stay with me for one more day, weirdos. It's a pretty light morning on competition in Beijing, so we're going to need some of your emails. Before you get too excited, I'm not fielding anything about the GB/Autralia non-competition. Aussies: you got fewer medals (gold and total) than the Brits and I don't care how sizeable your population relative to Britain's. And Brits, let's just let it lie already, OK. By all means take to the streets of Brisbane with your gloating, but leave it out here, all right.</p> <p>So, in the absence of that, what have we left? Well, there's the <strong>American basketball team</strong> on the court in the gold medal match: they're 22-22 against Spain in the first quarter as I type. I know some of the Americans -- <strong>Kobe</strong>, <strong>LeBron</strong>, <strong>Carmelo</strong>, they're all my bros; I know none of the Spanish, and for this reason I'm supporting the NBA divas and the wannabes.</p> <p>Later on, there's the <strong>closing ceremony</strong> and the main event - Britain's 10-minute presentation as the Olympic mantle officially transfers to London. That's going to be a spectacular shambles and I can't wait. I fully expect it'll only be necessary to describe in the plainest of terms what's happening on the screen and it'll be a comedy masterpiece; no embellishment necessary.</p> <p>That won't be for another few hours yet, so back to the basketball. It's 33-27 to USA.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>7.37am: </strong> The <strong>men's basketball gold medal match</strong> has just tipped-off. So there's no better time to hand you over to Howard Swains. Wow, that's it from me. See you in four years.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>7.28am: </strong>All those clips below are from past Olympics. So here are my top-five (admittedly Brit-focused) moments from Beijing 2008. In no particular order:</p> <p>1) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.rowing\">GB's women's quadruple sculls are beaten into second place</a>, cue a John Inverdale interview with tears and wry smiles.<br>2) Christine Ohuruogu looks down and out after the first half of the women's 400m. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/19/christineohuruogu.olympicsathletics\">But Sanya Richards tires, and the rest, as they say, is history</a>.<br>3) Sport and politics are always destined to mix. So with conflict between the two countries raging, Russia took on Georgia (well two Brazilians really) in the women's beach volleyball. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/13/olympics2008.olympicsvolleyball?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">And Georgia came out on top</a>.<br>4) On paper it sounds boring, but the 10km swim is actually quite compelling. David Davies seemed to have it all wrapped up, but then he started swimming in the wrong direction. Eventually cancer survivor Maarten van der Weijden came through to take gold, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/21/swimming.britisholympicteam\">but Davies fought delirium to hang on for silver</a>.<br>5) I suppose it's a tie between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics\">Michael Phelps' remarkable achievement</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/17/olympicsathletics.olympics2008\">Usain Bolt's</a> startling brilliance. Both utterly amazing, in their own separate way.<br>Agree, disagree? Let me know.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>7.09am: </strong>It's all over. I told you...GOLD FOR USA. Stanley is the man. What a final, way better than the football yesterday.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7.07am: </strong>One match point saved by Brazil.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>7.06am: </strong>This volleyball malarkey isn't half bad. USA are on the verge of a shock victory. Brazil have gone to pieces.</p> <!-- Block 45 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zi0_LjHHN4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_zi0_LjHHN4&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/_zi0_LjHHN4&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>6.58am: </strong>Actually, this is it.

Above is one of my favourite Olympic moments. What are yours?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.47am: </strong> The basketball bronze medal match is over, and argentina have the bronze. They beat Lithuania 87-75.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>6.44am: </strong>China have won another medal, Zou Shiming has claimed gold in the light-flyweight boxing.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.40am: </strong> If you're not as gripped with the volleyball as I am, Spain are taking on Croatia for the <strong>handball bronze medal</strong>. Plus there are a host of boxing finals going on, if you want some fist-flailing action.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.35am: </strong><strong>Volleyball </strong>Tactically the USA are playing this just right. They've now gone 2-1 up against the much fancied Brazilians.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.10am: </strong>Jeanne Perrett wants to know what time the closing ceremony starts. Well Jeanne, I'm here to serve. The festivities kick-off at 1300 BST or 2000 Beijing time. Apparently you can look forward to three hours of \"action\".</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.08am: </strong>U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A, My boys have leveled things up; it's one set apiece in the <strong>volleyball.</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.05am: </strong>Over on the <strong>basketball</strong> court Argentina are currently beating Lithuania 57-39 in the bronze medal match. hopefully it's whetting your appetite for the main course of the USA v Spain.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5.58am: </strong>I make no apologies for missing the result of the rhythmic gymnastics all-around group competition. Apparently Russia took gold with a totally arbitrary score of 35.550. China were second and Belarus took the bronze. I, for one, can't wait 'til next time.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5.50am: </strong>As i predicted the USA are fighting back in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. They lead 17-14 in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>5.28am: </strong>Pommie Barsteward has added to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics20082\">the 100 things that they have learned in Beijing</a>. He proposes two new entries. <br>101. <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/24/2344788.htm?site=olympics/2008\">Aussie gold medals cost the tax payer $16.7m each</a>. <br><a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/24/2344844.htm?site=olympics/2008\">102. And Aussies aren't the world's most gracious losers</a>.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>5.20am: </strong>The Olympics is all about tear jerking tales (watch Derek Redmond hobbling down the finishing straight and I defy you not to blub). Anyway Josh in Cambodia has this to say (I'm not even going to edit it): \"I live in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, a country with 4 Olympians. Their most promising athlete is a marathon runner, Hem Bunting, who got a silver medal in the Asian games last year. Anyway, I don't know how he did today (remarkably tough to find out on the Olympics website), but the guy has no funding, can't afford to buy training shoes, and is sometimes even locked out of the Olympic Stadium in Phnom Penh where he trains. He therefore trains by running around Phnom Penh, breathing diesel fumes and risking death by motorcycle.\" So if there are any representatives from large multinational sports corporations reading this, how about throwing some money his way!?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.17am: </strong><strong>GB&amp;NI news</strong> Chris Hoy has been confirmed as the Great Britain flag bearer for the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>5.10am: </strong>USA player Lloy Ball is a massive Rage Against the Machine fan apparently. He really should have been at Reading Festival on Friday instead of galavanting around at the Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>5.02am: </strong>Finally I've found out why there's one guy on each team with a different coloured shirt. I always assumed it was some kind of fashion statement. But it's because they are the 'libero', the ball control specialist. 4-1 to Brazil by the way</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>4.57am: </strong>Right is everyone rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrready for the men's gold medal match in the volleyball. It's a heavyweight clash: USA v Brazil. I'm excited. In the style of Two-Face I've flicked a coin and I can reveal that the USA are going to win. U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A...U...S...A</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>4.46am: </strong>Oliver Pattenden sheds some light on why people may not be reading: \"Team GB is up for sod all today, so we're saving ourselves for the pageant of Britishness later on.\" <em>I'm cringing already at the thought of all the old clich\u00e9s being wheeled out. However, it will be nice that Bozza Johnson will be there to show the world that nothing much has changed since GB last held the Olympics in 1948. </em></p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>4.32am: </strong><strong>READERS WHERE ARE YOU!?</strong> I need your witty, irreverent banter to help me through these awkward hours of non-sport. It's your last chance. After today I'll be disappearing into the ether never to be seen again.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.30am: </strong>I'm sorry, but I can't get into this rhythmic gymnastics guff. It's like one of those pretentious live art installations - boring, boring, boring. I wish there was some handball on, now that's a sport.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.26am: </strong>They think it's all over...it is now. Russia have claimed the bronze medal in the <strong>men's volleyball</strong>. Beating Italy 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>4.25am: </strong>Here's something I don't understand, why are sports like rhythmic gymnastics and synchronised swimming in the Olympics when cricket, golf and rugby not? Absolute nonsense if you ask me, oh and don't get me started on baseball and softball. Plus if you're going to have archery, you've got to allow darts. I'm sure you're all bored by these anglocentric arguments, but I'm getting quite emotional as end draws near.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>4.20am: Right, where are we. Russia are two sets and 20-18 up over Italy in the <strong>men's bronze medal volleyball match</strong>. And as I promised, over in the Beijing University of Technology Gymnasium, there's some rather delightful choreography going on in the <strong>rhythmic gymnastics</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>4.11am: </strong>It's just after 4am, time for some subtle plugging. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/24/olympics2008.olympicsathletics\">Anna Kessel interviews Usain Bolt</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/08/24/games_for_all_as_britain_shine.html\">Kevin Mitchell blogs about the Games' unsung heroes</a> and our writers reveal <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics20082\">the 100 things that they have learned in Beijing</a>.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.45am: </strong> According to Pommie Barsteward in Queensland: \"Kate Ellis, the Aussie sports minister, has been consuming vast quantities of humble pie on Aussie TV this morning. You may recall she had a bet with her UK counterpart before the Games regarding which nation would be placed highest in the medal table and, as she's on the losing end of the wager, she now has to wear a GB-related t-shirt at her next media appearance. Maybe some MBM readers would like to contribute some suitable design suggestions for the aforementioned apparel?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.42am: </strong>Shamini in Singapore has not been fully convinced by the Beijing Games: \"There's been too much sanctioned cheating and silly events - but Phelps and even more so Bolt have elevated sport to a new level - Bolt has restored my faith in the pure undiluted brilliance of the human spirit!\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.35am: </strong> One way traffic in the <strong>volleyball</strong>. Russia are one set up and leading 8-1 in the second.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.18am: </strong> Greg in Margaret River, Australia (which, by the way I've heard is a lovely place) reckons the Guardian's medal table is short changing our cousin over in Oz. Well, I did say we hadn't deliberately altered the USA's total, but I can't be so sure about Australia's. After all us Brits have had to endure years of sporting torment at the hands of the Wallabies. Maybe we'll let you win the Ashes next year to make you feel better.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.10am: </strong>So it appears that the real leader of Great Britain, David Beckham, is going to play a prominent role in the closing ceremony. \"It's going to be very different from the opening ceremony, which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show Chinese culture to the world,\" one of the directors, Miao Pei, told China's Southern Metropolis News. Mind you I'd rather see Becks over in Beijing playing the diplomat than clogging up England's right side with his one-dimensional punting.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.07am: </strong> Right now that the marathon has been sorted out, there's some <strong>men's volleyball</strong> medals up for grabs. Russia take on Italy in the bronze medal match. It's currently 8-4 to Russia. Can they hang on? I have no idea.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.55am: </strong>Dan Robinson finishes 24th with a time of just over 2 hours 16 minutes. 24th may not sound great, but in the conditions it was a truly monumental effort.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.46am: </strong>Brendon Foster has added some much needed doom and gloom to the proceedings, pointing out that no British male distance runners have finished in the top eight for the first time since 1896. Good one Brendon, there's been way too much unadulterated joy for my liking too.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.44am: </strong>Merga looks absolutely knackered, as team-mate Kebede overtakes him to grab the bronze medal. Fourth place is the cruelest position. London Marathon winner Martin Lel finishes fifth.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.40am: </strong><strong>Marathon </strong>Samuel Wanjiru is greeted by thousands of fans in the Bird's Nest Stadium. He's run a great race, outlasting all the rest. It's GOLD for Kenya in a new Olympic record time. Gharib of Morocco gets the silver.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.35am: </strong>Tony Jarrett (possibly the famous hurdler, who knows) says: \"It has been really great to see so many Union Jacks waved by happy, often triumphant people, without listening to hatred and abuse of other countries.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.30am: </strong>Back to the <strong>marathon</strong>. Wanjiru is sweating profusely as he makes a break. The gold medal is now his to lose.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.23am: </strong>Oh dear more 'issues' with the medal table Stephen Vaughn says: \"Could you please explain why the Guardian's medal count shows 103 medals for the United States, rather than the 107 that the U.S. has actually won? Are you docking us 4 medals for George W. Bush?\"<br><em>I can assure you Stephen that it's not Guardian policy to alter results according to political leanings. Although if Obama was incharge.....</em></p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.18am: </strong>Having only just got into the office, I'm shocked to see the Russians have leap frogged GB&amp;NI. Well it was good while it lasted.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.10am: </strong>In the <strong>marathon</strong> it looks like we're down to three. Deriba Merga, Samuel Kamau Wanjiru and Jaouad Gharib will duke it out for gold, silver and bronze.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.02am: </strong>Don't you just love how sport gives politicians the opportunity to spout off. Scottish Sports minister Stewart Maxwell says that Scotland should compete in its own right at the 2012 Olympics and not as part of Team GB. \"\"This is an exceptionally brilliant nation - at the same time a small nation. Scotland can compete on the world stage - we proved that in the Olympics - and a Scottish team at the Olympics is the future,\" he said.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.00am: </strong><strong>Marathon </strong> drama. The relentless pace has forced out Luke Kibet. This is all getting a bit ridiculous now, Martin Lel is even struggling.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1.55am: </strong>If we're to believe all the hyperbole this has been the greatest Olympics ever. Spitz's medal haul was smashed and Michael Johnson now looks like a Sunday morning jogger when compared to the Lightning Bolt. But has it really been that great? How many times have the hairs on the back of your neck stood up or tears flowed down your face? Let me know.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1.50am: </strong>\"But what else is happening?\", I hear you ask. Well on my watch you can look forward to medal matches in <strong>men's basketball</strong>, <strong>men's water polo</strong>, <strong>men's handball</strong> and <strong>men's volleyball</strong>. Plus they'll be some prancing and dancing in the <strong>rhythmic gymnastics</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.44am: </strong>Morning all. Well it's the final day of competition and what better way to kick it off than the most grueling event of all - the marathon. On the BBC Crammy can't believe what his Mackem eyes are telling him, the leading five athletes are setting a blistering pace. Surely they won't be able to keep it up!?</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p>Patrick will be at 1.40am</p>"
