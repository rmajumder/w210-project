Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Police in the United States are desperately searching for a six-year-old boy after he was taken from his home at gunpoint four days ago by three men posing as police. It is feared that the boy could be a pawn in the border drug war that has cost 3,700 lives this year alone and that he may have been abducted by a Mexican gang.</p> <p>Cole Puffinburger was taken early last Wednesday after three armed men, described as Hispanic, went into the house in Las Vegas and demanded money. They then tied up Cole's mother and left with the boy. </p> <p>Police believe he may have been taken because his grandfather, Clemens Fred Tinnemeyer, 51, owed Latino methamphetamine dealers between $8m and $20m (\u00a34.6m-\u00a311.6m). Last night Tinnemeyer was in custody being questioned by police; he is a legal bankrupt and was believed to be travelling in a beige-and-gold Winnebago motor trailer when he was arrested yesterday in Riverside over the Nevada-California border.</p> <p>Las Vegas police captain Vincent Cannito said the case involved significant amounts of money and drugs and that there was a definite link between the family and drug deals. Law enforcement agencies said they were searching several locations in north east Las Vegas, and that, having arrested a second man, they were now looking for a third, Jesus Gasterone. </p> <p>'The investigation has taken different aspects some of which involve family members, some friends of the family. There's a strong network within a very close proximity,' Cannito said. Investigators had issued an 'amber alert' for the missing boy to police departments on routes from Las Vegas to Mexico but withdrew it yesterday, saying its effectiveness had run its course.</p> <p>According to early reports, Tinnemeyer has worked as a carpenter for more than two decades. He has not been in contact with his family since May and was reported missing last month.</p> <p>The abduction happened when three men knocked on the door of the house where Cole Puffinburger lived. After tying up his mother and her boyfriend, they ransacked the house and then took Cole. Last night the boy's father appealed for his son's release. 'It is beyond me why anyone would do something so cruel to anyone, let alone a little boy,' said Robert Puffinburger, a civil engineer. 'All I want is for them to bring him home. I don't care about the rest of it. Just let him go somewhere. Drop him off. I don't care. Just keep him safe.'</p> <p>The Mexican-run drug trade uses transport corridors though New Mexico and Arizona to Las Vegas, and then on to markets in the Midwest and beyond. Investigators said traffickers usually seized cars and other assets to recoup money. But they also fear Cole's abduction is a sign that the grotesque violence that characterises the battle for control of Mexico's drug trade could be seeping across the border into the US.</p> <p>An attempted crackdown by authorities since August appears to have triggered a dramatic escalation in violence, with 387 people killed in the first two weeks of October and gangs resorting to torture and beheadings. Even women and children are targets in the daily ritual of revenge killings.</p> <p>According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the border turf war is primarily between the Tijuana-based cartel of the Arellano F\u00e9lix brothers, the Ju\u00e1rez cartel, based across Chihuahua state and led by the Carrillo Fuentes family, and the Sinaloa gang, led by Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n.</p> <p>'The pressure [from the authorities] that's being put upon drug cartels in Mexico has caused an escalation in violence,' said DEA spokeswoman Sarah Pullen last week. 'It's horrific. If you look at what's happened with many of the beheadings down there, the killings are definitely to send a message.'</p> <p>On Friday, President George W Bush's top drug enforcement officer, John Walters, warned that Mexico's cartels were now entering the US to make their attacks. 'They come across and kidnap, murder and carry out assassinations,' he said. 'They do not respect the border.'</p> <p>Walters sent a direct message to the traffickers: 'They have a choice: come in and face justice, or die.'</p> <p>In one incident last week six people were lined up against a wall and shot in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, directly across the border from El Paso, Texas. The assassins fired more than 100 bullets and left a note warning: 'Message for all rats, this will continue.'</p> <p>One of the victims blamed a drug cartel for the killings before he died, saying he had been accused by his murderers of selling drugs for a rival gang. </p> <p>The abduction has left the Las Vegas neighbourhood of Cherry Grove Avenue fearful. The victim's next-door neighbour, Guadaloupe Negrete, said parents in the area were anxious. </p> <p>Cole Puffinburger has now become an unwitting trophy in an escalating war.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why?</strong></p> <p>In a city rammed to the gills with fancy hotels, the Connaught is perhaps the fanciest of them all. It's certainly the most expensive (suites regularly hit a grand a night), the most recently refurbished (it has enjoyed/endured a multi-squillion-pound, year-long makeover), and the most butler-y (a corps of 15 fully trained old-style butlers service the hotel's guests, with a further 10 expected to be hired by next spring). For these and multiple other reasons (expanses of marble floor, stunning ceiling roses, stupendously sweet liveried doormen, the smell of money, the sense that no corner has been cut, anywhere, anyhow), the Connaught is pure, unadulterated luxury. Anna Wintour insists on staying there, any time she's in town. Unsurprisingly, it's got a killer bar. Actually - it's got two killer bars, the Coburg, which is tasteful and discreet and not at all my style, and the Connaught Bar, which is a sparkly, art-deco jewel box of an extravaganza, and therefore very much my style. </p> <p><strong>Are you even a tiny bit aware that we're mired in the advanced stages of a recession, and that it's contrary to prevailing sensitivities to go boozing in v expensive venues?</strong></p> <p>I am very aware of the credit crunch as it happens. I've swapped my customary champagne baths for cava ones, and even considered DIY-ing my manicures! (I know!) However, I think that this is precisely the time one needs to indulge in decadent drink-ups - less frequent, higher quality. This sort of thing will make you much jollier, and give you an easier, less moody, hangover, because the alcohol's better. </p> <p><strong>It scares me when your logic begins to seem sensible.</strong></p> <p>Just go with it! So, the Connaught Bar's been closed, along with the rest of the hotel, for this lengthy and costly makeover; its reopening coincided almost exactly with the Cocktail Girl's birthday. Clearly it would have been plain rude to celebrate the ebbing away of one's youth anywhere else. So off I popped. </p> <p><strong>And?</strong></p> <p>Well my dear, it was immense fun. I secured myself a banquette in the forward section of the bar, so I could check out the barmen as they worked (such vigorous shaking!). I was struck by the waitresses' excellent grey tailored frocks. (I made several attempts to buy one but was told, firmly, that they were a perk of the job and not for general consumption.) I was presented with a cocktail menu, a bowl of the bar's signature caramelised pecans (yum!) and a mini-drink, designed to amuse my bouche while I was choosing my main-course cocktail. </p> <p><strong>Which was?</strong></p> <p>A Mayfair Delight, a dryish, cucumber-tinted variant of a champagne cocktail, which was very good indeed. While I was sipping away at it in a most contented fashion, I spotted Santino Cicciari, overlord of the international cocktail-making scene, and creative head of operations at the Connaught Bar. He came over to say hello, and show me his special balls!</p> <p><strong>Dear God.</strong></p> <p>Which are made from ice. A special kind of ice, designed to melt very, very slowly, in the interest of not diluting one's drink too quickly. They're a thing of great beauty, let me tell you, are Santino's ice balls. Just when I thought things could not possibly get any ritzier (or should that be: Connaught-ier?) I was served a selection of bar snacks, designed by the hotel's award-winning chef H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Darroze; and they were stunningly good. (Squid and chorizo and sun-dried tomato skewer, anyone? Hell, yes!) </p> <p>So there you go. The Connaught. My new favourite hotel bar and no mistake. It's in its first flush of post-refurb lushness right now, chaps; so do yourselves a favour and go soon. Kisses. CG. </p> <p>\u2022 The Connaught Bar, Carlos Place, London W1, 020 7499 7070</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma:</strong> My boyfriend and I have just celebrated our first year together. He is gorgeous, loving and faithful. I care for him a lot, but in my heart I know he is not right for me. I don't want to use him, but on my own I am desperately lonely. What should I do?</p> <p><strong>Mariella:</strong> The problem isn't that you don't love him, it's that you're not very good at loving yourself. There's nothing wrong with dating someone you don't have a future with - men in particular make it an absolute mission in their youth, and in extreme cases long into middle age. I suggest you worry less about your lack of commitment to your boyfriend and more about your paralysing fear of your own company. No matter how much inessential socialising you can cram into your daily life, there will always be times when you find yourself alone and, worse still, not necessarily by choice. Learning to face solitude without being struck down by morbid terror is an essential part of growing up. There's no rule that says you have to be fully committed to a picket fence and 2.5 children in order to be dating someone, but there should be a law against embarking on a serious partnership before you've learned to get on with the person you're truly stuck with. </p> <p>There are few men who could rise to the challenge of such irrational neediness. To be honest, I'm surprised you've found even one! </p> <p>You don't divulge your age, but I'm guessing you're in your twenties. As regular readers know, it wasn't one of my favourite eras, thanks to similar battles with insecurity. But in my early thirties, it was clear that the fear of being left on the shelf, while not at all uncommon, was ludicrous. It's a fate that at any age is unlikely, but is nigh-on impossible in your twenties. </p> <p>Your own company is one of the few things that really does improve with age. The older you get the more appealing it becomes, though ironically it arrives in tandem with increasing and unwelcome illuminations on your own shortcomings. As we mature, our relationship with ourselves, warts and all, requires qualities we should also aspire to in our long-term partnerships: forgiveness, understanding, acceptance, and a sense of humour about character flaws that can't be erased.</p> <p>Coming to terms with yourself is one of the highlights of maturity; indeed, I'd argue it's perhaps the only compensation for aching limbs, erratic sleep patterns and increasing wrinkles. Enjoying your own company doesn't prevent you from getting lonely, it just puts that raw fear of abandonment into perspective. If you accept that the worst thing that can happen to you on a social level is that you may sometimes be forced to - rather than choose to - be alone, it negates the sting of a night at home with a silent telephone. So, if the greatest threat in ending an unsatisfactory relationship is a few months licking your wounds and being self-indulgent, why panic? I guarantee that as you get older 'me time' will become a pastime you resent not being allowed to indulge in more often. </p> <p>I'm not a good example of much, but it was certainly after I'd started to covet my own company that along came the only person in the world I preferred being with. It's definitely a better arrangement than spending your time with anyone you can tolerate just to avoid being left staring yourself in the face. Suffering from loneliness from time to time just means that you are human. It's a state of mind that confirms our basic herd mentality, and why getting along well with your fellow man and woman is an aspiration not to be underrated. Left alone too long, we may get overly introspective, but never escaping the burble of other humans is equally damaging. It's often the case that when you can't hear yourself think you eventually just give up trying to. We may not have been made to walk the earth alone, but to truly appreciate the company of others you have to experience the solace of solitude. Running into someone else's arms in order to plug a yawning existential void is definitely not to be recommended.</p> <p>Continue your affair because he makes you laugh, is great in bed, shares an interest or hobby, but not because you're afraid to be without him. Banishing the fear of your own company is an essential ingredient for relationship contentment and one of the many reasons that a coupling between mature adults stands a better chance of longevity than one between youngsters. The biggest dysfunctional relationship in your life at present involves you and you alone. Just imagine how liberating it would be to shake off the fear that is paralysing your actions and limiting your choices. The scariest thought in the world is not being left alone but never being left alone. The moment you start to appreciate that, the larger and more bountiful your universe will become.

  "<p>Concern is growing over the number of pension savers either slashing their monthly contributions, or suspending them altogether, in a bid to conserve cash in the credit crunch.</p> <p>More than one in 10 has now completely frozen their pension payments, according to comparison website uSwitch, while two separate reports from insurers Axa and Prudential warn that many spooked savers are now choosing to pay in less to fund their retirement.</p> <p>Many in their thirties and forties - the key age for boosting your pension fund - are doing so to meet higher mortgage repayments, ensure household bills are paid, and shore up savings, the research suggests. 'In these strident times, there will be plenty of situations where people are confronted with a stark choice - pay the bills or pay your pension contribution - and it's entirely understandable that, for some, the pension contribution will be put on a back burner,' says Tom McPhail at independent financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown.</p> <p>But by holding off from paying into either a personal or company 'defined contribution' fund - where you build up a tax-free sum to exchange for an annuity, or income for life, in retirement - you risk storing up harsher financial difficulties for the future.</p> <p>The danger of withholding pension payments is twofold: first, savers face the sacrifice of long-term growth and, second, they miss out on the much cheaper cost of 'buying into' their pension when yo-yoing stock markets are on their knees. </p> <p>In the first instance, a 30-year-old woman earning \u00a330,000, who contributes \u00a3200 a month, already has a fund of \u00a320,000. She can look forward to a private pension when 65 of \u00a39,400 a year if she carries on as normal, assuming annual growth of 6 per cent after charges, according to Hargreaves Lansdown calculations. </p> <p>However, squeezed by the financial turmoil and scared by falling share prices, the same woman decides to shore up her more immediate personal finances instead, and stops paying in for two years before picking up where she left off in 2010; her projected pension now drops considerably, to \u00a38,200. And when she picks up again, it would take a greater chunk of her pay to get back on track.</p> <p>'Today's short-term fix for your finances could make it potentially worse in the future,' McPhail warns. 'In particular, if you're in a work pension scheme where, say, every pound you save is effectively doubled by your employer, it'll have a real impact.'</p> <p>But for many families feeling the pinch today, that concern will be very distant and won't register as one to heed. 'The problem is that it's easy to put off pension contributions because there's nothing to actually lose today, especially when you need the money elsewhere,' says Steve Folkard, head of pensions and savings at Axa. 'There's actually a term to describe this kind of behaviour: \"hyperbolic discounting\". In a nutshell, it's our tendency to prefer a smaller payout today [shoring up our cash] over the possibility of a bigger payout later; namely, a decent pension.' </p> <p>The second danger from cutting contributions during this period of extreme volatility is the lost opportunity to grab much more pension bang for your buck. 'When markets are down like they have been, it's much cheaper to be investing as it's a good buying opportunity; so whether you cut back from \u00a3150 to \u00a3100 every month, or from \u00a350 a month to nothing, you risk missing out,' warns Adrian Lowcock of independent financial adviser BestInvest. </p> <p>This may well sound like asking for the impossible right now, especially following the blind panic and fears stalking the world's stock markets since late September. But the way that most savers put money in a pension underlines why, if you can spare the cash, the turmoil may well offer the best time to buy.</p> <p>The majority of pension savers pay in a set sum each month to a fund investing in the stock market, and the fixed amount buys you a given number of 'units' in your pension fund, depending on their price. When these fluctuate, as is the case with turbulent markets and uncertain economic outlooks, the value of your existing units rises and falls but, crucially, the fixed sum you save every month doesn't. This allows you to buy more units in your fund when share prices are plummeting, but fewer when they're on the up.</p> <p>Imagine that, for a year, \u00a3200 buys roughly 10 units each month, each worth \u00a320, in a pension fund. The following year, wild financial uncertainty sets in and pushes down stock markets; the cost of buying each unit in a pension fund now halves to \u00a310. So, \u00a3200 gets 20 units each month at the lower price. </p> <p>Now the 120 units bought in the previous year are worth less than they were, but twice as many have been bought this year. Assuming the pension stays invested over the long term - and, historically, equity markets usually show growth over a period of decades - the price of the larger number of units rises and builds a bigger pot for retirement.</p> <p>'We often see investors caught out by buying high and selling low,' adds McPhail, 'and there's a risk that people make that mistake now. If you can find the room to keep putting some pension money into the market, this may well be one of those opportunities to buy.'</p> <p>It's a very difficult message to get across, many pension advisers and insurers acknowledge, since the horrific events of the past three weeks do nothing to inspire confidence - especially, as Lowcock points out, among the young. 'Those in their twenties and early thirties will have little memory of the early Nineties recession, will be unwilling to invest, can't commit to a pension, and are simply worried about how to respond.'</p> <p>Older savers in their forties and early fifties, he suggests, will remember previous crashes and keep on buying. 'The biggest problem investors have, year after year, is that they wait for a sustained rise before getting back into equities; the problem is, the markets are already rising and people have missed out on growth.'</p> <p>One way to ensure your defined contribution fund won't leave you stranded is to check if it will 'lifestyle' as you get older. This process simply shifts money away from riskier equities and into safer bonds and cash, which tend to be more resilient during market upheaval. It's default behaviour for many pension funds, but it's essential to make sure: ring the pension administrator or check with the underlying insurer itself. </p> <p>For those in a final salary scheme, the situation is very different, despite estimated losses of nearly \u00a350bn in the UK's 200 biggest final salary schemes in the week starting 6 October, according to Aon Consulting. Since the risk of returns is held with the employer, the bigger risk to temporarily withholding payments would be if your scheme goes bust. However, the Pension Protection Fund will guarantee a chunk of retirement money is safe.</p> <p>\u2022 More details at <a href=\"http://www.pensionprotectionfund.org.uk.\">pensionprotectionfund.org.uk.</a></p>",
  "<p>Anti-abortion MPs last night abandoned their parliamentary fight for new restrictions, calling for the bitterly contested issue to be resolved by a high powered inquiry instead.</p> <p>Nadine Dorries, the Tory MP and former nurse who has led attempts to cut the time limit for abortions, said the issue was too important to become a 'political football' and deserved more lengthy reflection. </p> <p>The retreat came as Wednesday's vote on the government's embryology bill, seen by anti-abortionists at first as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to change the law on a woman's right to choose, risked descending into farce. </p> <p>Downing Street had still not resolved a cabinet row over how to handle the bill yesterday. But it is expected that the time allotted for debate will be so sharply curtailed that dozens of rival abortion amendments tabled by both sides in the argument will not be put to a vote, meaning that the law is likely to stay unchanged.</p> <p>Pro-choice MPs had been increasingly confident they could win a vote on scrapping the rule that two doctors must consent to a termination, making it easier for women to get the procedure. However, both sides now appear fearful of tampering with the law, with pro-choice MPs worried that even if they won they would give the Lords a chance to reopen the debate and introduce more restrictions.</p> <p>Dorries said the issue had been dragged into political horsetrading, with Labour reluctant to debate it during by-elections. 'Abortion has not been given proper airtime on the floor of the chamber and we know the public are not happy with the way the vote took place last time,' she said. 'It has all descended into whisper, rumour and complications.' </p> <p>She has now tabled an amendment jointly with Labour MP Frank Field, asking instead for a balanced committee of MPs and peers nominated by the Speaker to report within nine months of the embryology bill becoming law, with the Health Secretary bound to legislate accordingly within two years. Dorries hopes that this proposal could also attract the support of pro-choice MPs.</p> <p>A report due out today from academics chaired by Professor David Jones, a bio-ethicist and leading advocate of restricting abortions, calls for 'further reflective and comprehensive review' of the issues surrounding abortion. 'It is not acceptable for matters of such moral and social importance to be decided by amendments tagged on to a government bill without adequate opportunity for reflection and public engagement,' the report concludes.</p> <p>Health Secretary Alan Johnson is said now to be anxious just to get the bill into law without further distractions. Originally designed to regulate fertility treatment, it does not even mention abortion but was hijacked by campaigners on both sides of the argument.</p>",

'People who work with personal trainers generally want to achieve something, and they see that as quite an important thing to them, so maybe they would not get rid of that before getting rid of other things.' </p> <p>He hopes that the one-to-one service he provides will protect him. However, he appreciates that it would be 'naive' not to fear a knock-on effect if his designer and architect clients are hit.</p> <h2>The hairdresser</h2> <p><strong>Vernon Deysiel, manager of the Headmasters salon in Hanover Street, Mayfair.</strong></p> <p>The hair industry will not be badly hit, 'because girls still have to get their roots done - every four to six weeks, ideally'. But the salon has devised strategies to encourage business, 'because prevention is better than cure. We have 11 stylists who charge from \u00a330-\u00a380 for a haircut. But if there is a free slot and you can make it within the hour you get it for \u00a320. It's a bargain and we don't lose an hour of our time which could be used making money rather than sitting around,' he said.</p> <h2>The solicitor</h2> <p><strong>Patricia Durham Hall, 57, a Taunton solicitor specialising in conveyancing.</strong></p> <p>Durham Hall lost her job three weeks ago as high street law firms continued to be hit by the property crash. It is the second time in two years she has fallen victim to job cuts.</p> <p>'At the moment my chances of getting another job in law are absolutely nil,' said the director of the Devon and Somerset Law Society.</p> <p>She and her husband, a company secretary, can probably manage financially for another six months. But it will be a struggle.</p> <p>'It's grim. There are no openings at all for people in the property sector. So I'm at home. Put it this way: the garden has never looked so good, the dogs have never been walked so much. It has cut our income down by at least a third and we have had to take in a lodger.'</p> <p>The couple have six children, two from her previous marriage to a circuit judge, and four from her husband's previous marriage, but only the youngest is still at university.</p> <p>'I have signed on for jobseeker's allowance,' added Durham Hall, also a magistrate. 'I'm not too proud to do that and it's a brand new experience for me. I feel terrible, emotionally, about being out of work. You wonder what on earth you worked so hard for all those years, just to be made redundant on the turn of a coin.</p> <p>'I am willing to do anything, being on a till at Morrisons or Tesco, whatever, but people don't want to hire you because, I suppose, they think you're over-qualified.'</p> <p>She spends half of each day applying for jobs. But the applications disappear into cyberspace. 'I did think about cancelling my gym membership because it would save \u00a350 a month. But it's been a lifeline. It gets me out of the house, and it gives me a routine and I think that is essential for people in my position. What are you going to do otherwise? Sit at home and drink yourself under the table every day?' she joked. </p> <p>'Personally, it is very demoralising and you have got to be a fairly strong person not to sink. You have got to look for ways forward.'</p> <h2>The trainee plumber</h2> <p><strong>David Falconer, 46, an insurance broker</strong></p> <p>Falconer found himself out of work in April, for the second time in four years. The last time he was laid off it took him 16 months to find his job at Guy Carpenter, the world's biggest reinsurance brokers.</p> <p>'This time, I knew it was going to take a lot longer,' said the father-of-one who has worked in finance for a quarter of a century. So he has enrolled at The Plumbing Academy in Edenbridge, Kent, which, according to its chief executive Steven Edwards, has seen a 20 per cent rise in admissions from <br>ex-City workers in recent months. </p> <p>Falconer and his wife, who works for a West End investment management company, have let their four-bedroomed detached home and are renting a flat to ease the financial pressures. 'I didn't want to sit around doing nothing, waiting for somebody to offer me a job which just wasn't going to happen,' he said. 'Plumbing really appealed and I wanted to get out there, have a real challenge, and test myself. Hopefully, being made redundant could be the best thing. That's the way I look at it.'</p> <h2>The architect</h2> <p><strong>Andy von Bradsky is chairman of PRP, one of the UK's leading architectural practices.</strong></p> <p>The industry has been taken aback by the sudden collapse of the financial market: 'I think it is the speed at which it happened that has taken people by surprise,' Von Bradsky said. 'In the late Eighties the downturn was slower. This time, it has been brutal. </p> <p>'The collapse over two or three weeks pretty much killed off any kind of optimism the industry could ride it out unscathed. Now we are faced with how we deal with the year ahead.'</p> <p>His company, which employs 400, made a 'small' number redundant recently. But, he said, the impact had been less savage because PRP had diversified. 'We are having to look at our workload and work profile almost on a week-by-week basis to be sure of how certain our income is from a project,' he added. 'There is a huge degree of uncertainty about the months ahead.</p> <p>'Those who have concentrated entirely on the speculative nature of housebuilding and built their whole practice around it will find it will affect them more.'</p> <h2>The jeweller</h2> <p><strong>Jeremy Hoye, 43, designer of contemporary jewellery who has a shop in Ship Street, Brighton and an online business.</strong></p> <p>Hoye has had a turbulent few months including an unexpected jump in sales in recent weeks.</p> <p>'Business is up one month, down the next,' he said. 'Funnily enough, though, the last three weeks when the news has been at its blackest, it's been pretty good. </p> <p>'People still get engaged or married and celebrate their birthdays during a recession, and they are still buying jewellery. It could be because the recession has been so rammed down our throats and we're talking such huge, huge sums people cannot comprehend. It's out of their control. So I think they sit back and think, \"There's nothing I can do so I might as well enjoy myself and buy those earrings.\"'</p>",
  "<p>After being accused of precipitating the present financial crisis by short-selling banks, hedge funds are now turning their attention to student loans.</p> <p>Jim Chanos, founder and president of Kynikos, one of the best known short- selling hedge funds in the US, has student loan companies high on his list to short for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>'This industry has much in common with the sub-prime mortgage industry,' Chanos said. 'Things do not look very bright.'</p> <p>They don't. More than two-thirds of American university students rely on loans to pay for college, but loan applications are being turned down in record numbers as the near collapse of the credit market is making all but the most secure loans impossible to write.</p> <p>More than 137 lenders that participate in a US government-backed student loan programme have been forced to suspend operations in recent weeks as the wheels of the global credit market have ground to a halt. Another 33 companies have stopped issuing loans to students at private universities.</p> <p>As a consequence, applications for government student aid have soared in recent weeks, according to data from the US Department of Education, as more and more students are finding it hard to make ends meet. </p> <p>Applications for Federal Student Aid are up 17 per cent to nine million students this academic year, 1.3 million more than last year.</p> <p>David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's in New York, said the financial situation for many US students is dire. 'There are two reasons this has gone bad. Firstly, of course, the financial markets have locked up. But also there have been some changes to the law which make the provision of student loans a lot less attractive to lenders.'</p> <p>Almost a year ago, the US Congress axed a $21bn subsidy package to student loan companies, making it harder for them to turn a profit.</p>",
  "<p>Just occasionally, as gloom flows like molten lava, it's useful to try a touch of history. So what do you do when a prophet you greatly admire - Emily Bell, director of digital content here at the Guardian and Observer - talks about 'systemic collapse, not just cyclical downturn' in a lecture last week? How do you survive Emily's vision of worst-case 'carnage' - five national papers (and much else) dead within a couple of years? You reach for a modern history text of ABC circulation figures and hope to find something better.</p> <p>Five years ago - a historic turning point - the shape of newspaper things to come changed abruptly. The Independent went tabloid and the Times followed; a little later, the Guardian became a Berliner. In the quality market, only the Telegraph stayed stalwartly broadsheet. And now? Take last month's circulation figures and compare them directly with September 2003, the month just before the first tabloid plans were hatched. See how shrinking page sizes worked out. </p> <p>The Indy was selling 218,567 then, 144,050 of them at full cover price (excluding bulk giveaways, overseas copies and cut-price wheezes). Last month it recorded 220,957 on the top line and sold 128,738 at full price, which is 15,312 down. The Times had a total sale of 629,815 in September 2003, of which 455,603 were at full price. Last month, that was 638,003 with 435,771 at full price, a 19,832 drop. The Guardian had 353,464 in overall headline terms, with 330,484 at full price, compared with a 348,878 headline last month and 287,288 at full price; 43,000-plus gone.</p> <p>And the unchanging Telegraph? In headline terms, 934,341 five years ago, with 546,905 at full price: Last month: 851,254 top-line and 379,595 at full price; 167,310 full-price 90ps gone. </p> <p>Now, those are only bare facts, and conclusions come clothed in many shades of interpretation. The fashionable move to copies bought at a lesser price on subscription affects some comparisons, as does the timing of the switch in size. Migration online has a clear impact. There are a host of other variables, too.</p> <p>But can you totally put aside the thought that the one daily that didn't shape down has endured the biggest losses in headline and full-price terms - and that the first two quality tabloids in the ring are both recording higher ABC sales than they were five years ago? </p> <p>Sometimes, amid encircling gloom, it's wise to set benchmarks longer than a week last Friday. Always, there are choices to be made - or not made. And usually (perhaps, maybe) innovation is its own reward. A Times drop of under 20,000 in five years isn't systemic collapse. A Guardian surge online that brings in more than 23 million unique users a month on top of a million-plus print readers isn't carnage. (Neither is an Observer September full-price sale of 381,145 too dusty when you set it against the 398,175 of five years back.) </p> <p>Of course, some drumbeats threaten doom. A People down 13 per cent or a Daily Star Sunday minus 21 per cent in a year aren't exactly long-distance runners. Yet there's the FT - revenues up 11 per cent this year - to throw into the pot. Then there's the pending dip in digital revenues to create new equations. Great papers such as the New York Times are 12 per cent down, and worse. But the NYT has been whacking up the price, cutting back on pagination and cutting off areas of former circulation as too expensive to serve. It's contrived some of its own desuetude. Maybe it ought to try turning tabloid.</p> <h2>BBC 'vision' merely shuffles pieces round the board</h2> <p>If you lived in Manchester when Granada was in its pomp, you knew what benefits flowed: the city was a smarter, sassier, more intelligent place because creative people made it so. Perhaps shifting 1,600 BBC staff up from London to Salford Quays will give the same buzz. Perhaps moving Question Time to Glasgow or Casualty to Cardiff will make all of Britain buzzier still. </p> <p>Yet somehow the new raft of moves announced by Jana Bennett, the modestly named Director of Vision - 6 per cent of network spending in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland up to 12 per cent by 2012 and 17 per cent by 2016 and so forth - don't have that Granada touch of romance: more a feel of keeping politicians and management consultants happy, of sharing out licence-fee budgets like dolly mixtures. Thus Scotland gets The Weakest Link - and presumably thousands of contestants travelling north in a carbon cloud of extra emissions only marginally alleviated by letting Kirsty Wark do Newsnight without leaving Glasgow. </p> <p>But where's the creative juice in merely pushing existing shows round a board? The real vision thing comes from cross-fertilisation, not from (oh regions! oh nations!) shunting coverage of the Chelsea Flower Show off to Birmingham.</p> <h2>It isn't fair. It isn't balanced. Please can we have something like it?</h2> <p>Forget The Wire: the best, most savage and scintillating performance anywhere on TV (and More 4) this autumn, nine years old and going ever stronger, is the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. A comic as one of America's four 'most trusted' news presenters? You bet, as he pulverises Palin, minces McCain and burns Bush. This isn't a Rory Bremner turn, guns prudently balanced. This is a USA where Joe Sixpack drinks Sauvignon Blanc and hockey mums wear Prada.</p> <p>Why can't we have our own, home-grown daily dose? I asked one of the BBC's supreme controllers this the other day. Well, it would have a very small audience, she said. Really? In a world where Private Eye is our top-selling news magazine? And if the Beeb doesn't fancy an eyeful, then what on earth is Four for?</p> <h2>Mandy can lord it over snarling, sneering Mail</h2> <p>It's not often that the Daily Mail slithers down the slope from Rant to Rave to totally Ridiculous: but score one for the new Lord Mandelson of Foy.</p> <p>Quentin Letts was in the gallery for Mandelson's ermine debut, demanding: 'Just how can we see this Cabinet twice-reject, this Brussels blow-in, this greased porker made a lord and not, ourselves, squeal with disgust?' And that was only the headline. You had to read the small print to get the predictable jokes about Fey and bottom-clenching.</p> <p>Enough? By no means. Five pages on - 'The Day the House of Lords died of Shame' - Richard Littlejohn did it again. More noxious clouds of homophobia (involving sausages) and splenetic splutter. 'No sane person would keep [Baron M] as a pet - I'd rather have the neighbourhood nonce round for a Gary Glitter-themed children's birthday party'.</p> <p>Enough? Gosh, 24 hours later came yet another full page, this time with the touch of class and literary allusion Max Hastings provides. So we had Mandelson as Rasputin, 'relegating' the black-bearded monk 'to amateur status'. And the poet Cowper: 'I am the lord of the foul and the brute.' And Wodehouse on 'one of the lowest things to climb out of the slime'. Plus a more general blast about the lust of 'these ghastly old socialists' to 'lord it over us' and take titles from government (unlike Sir Max).</p> <p>Enough, surely? No: try another full page of 'disturbing questions' from David Williams, Chief Reporter, featuring a rich Russian, a yacht, a cocktail party and the clinching words of eternal damnation: 'According to a report in the Evening Standard ... '.</p> <p>And all this, remember, may only be for starters. It's too much already for the redoubtable Alice Miles in the Times: 'Britain was meant to be nicer than this.' But the Mail doesn't do nice. What it does do increasingly, though, is go over the top behind a barrage of sneer, snarl and innuendo, every hired gun blazing. Good stuff? Well, we'll see. But already it's pulled off one fantastic trick: making you feel a little ashamed - and somewhat sorry for his lordship.</p> <h2>Recognition for British business journalists</h2> <p>As the Gawker US website hands out plaudits for valiant performance in 'Panic '08' Britain has something to smile about. Lionel Barber, editor of the FT, is lauded for consistent seriousness, as is his chief business reporter, John Gapper, 'admirably hard on the villains'. Robert Thomson, late of the Times, is praised for a Wall Street Journal redesign 'perfect for big, scary headlines'. UK rules, OK?</p>",
  "<p>You know the world is going crazy, the comedian Chris Rock said, when the best golfer is a black guy and the best rapper is a white guy (whatever next, a black President?). The black golfer was Tiger Woods, the richest sportsman in the world. The white rapper was Eminem. Remember him?</p> <p>It is not so long ago that Eminem was being praised as a rapper of literary genius and decried as the greatest cultural menace in America. His mastery of a musical form invented by African-Americans drew comparisons with Elvis Presley and his linguistic vitality won unlikely fans such as Seamus Heaney and Zadie Smith. At the same time his lyrics, accused of glorifying misogyny, homophobia and violence, saw him branded Public Enemy Number One.</p> <p>Then Eminem went 'missing in action'. Devastated by the loss of his best friend, DeShaun 'Proof' Holton, shot dead outside a club two years ago, he became increasingly reclusive. The vacuum was filled by unhappy rumour and revelation. His remarriage to his ex-wife, emblazoned on the front of Hello! magazine, lasted only 11 weeks before a second divorce. His estranged mother published a memoir calling him a liar. There were still parallels with Presley, but this time in the years of Graceland decadence: he was said to be depressed, crippled by writer's block and bingeing on junk food in his Detroit mansion. With his health failing and weight ballooning, one US tabloid claimed Eminem was 'starting to look like an M&amp;M'.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that news of his first album for four years has electrified the ailing music industry and the rapper's persistently loyal fan base. Just when it seemed he was effectively retired, the 36-year-old is re-energised and at work in the studio. Now it is rumoured that the album, named last week as Relapse, is due to be released by Christmas.</p> <p>Early word suggests that he is back at the top of his game, though of course the hype would hardly say otherwise. But there is no questioning the massive expectations generated by the second coming of the one who took rap from the ghetto to the suburbs.</p> <p>A taster, 'I'm Having a Relapse', has already been leaked to the internet and begins teasingly, 'Guess who's back'. It doesn't take much guessing: 'How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?/ He's already got life in jail now what the hell is his problem/ Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic/ They compelled me to kill this elderly man an'/ I get these panic attacks, pop a Xanax relax/ Tryna stick my fuckin' dick inside a mannequin's ass ...'</p> <p>What remains to be seen is whether such lines still have the power to shock. Eminem was the b\u00eate noire of America's cultural conservatives, who feared his influence over the young and were glad to see the back of him. The 'culture wars', it was said, lost their impetus after the 9/11 attacks, only for 'hockey mom' and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin to prove they never quite went away. But another shift in taste has been taking place: a decline in hip-hop's popularity means that Eminem, who has sold more than 70 million records worldwide, returns to a changed musical landscape.</p> <p>'He's been gone for four years, which is an aeon in rap time,' said Sean Fennessey, music editor of Vibe magazine, whose readers have just voted Eminem the best rapper alive despite his long hiatus. 'He's the consummate rapper, incredibly skilful and thoughtful with a tremendously compelling story to tell. He was the first rapper who transcended racial consciousness to become a pop star. He's one of the most iconic musical artists for a long time, so his comeback is going to be big.'</p> <p>A decade ago rap was generally the preserve of black men from the ghetto with a short life expectancy. Tupac Shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996, Biggie Smalls in similar circumstances a year later. Marshall Mathers (hence the M&amp;M nickname), different race, similarly humble beginnings, burst on the scene in 1999 with the The Slim Shady LP, winning mainstream popularity and Grammy awards. His follow-up, The Marshall Mathers LP, became the fastest-selling hip-hop album in history and cemented his status as the Elvis of rap - a description he always hated.</p> <p>His copious use of the words 'bitch' and 'faggot' aroused indignation on both sides of the political spectrum, threatening to put the entire rap genre in the dock. </p> <p>Eminem's performing alter ego, Slim Shady, was accused of misogyny after hit singles such as 'My Name Is', which included the line: 'Ninety-nine per cent of my life I was lied to, I just found out my mom does more dope than I do.' Debbie Mathers-Briggs, who was 15 when she gave birth to him in Kansas City (his father left after six months), has denied the portrayal.</p> <p>Eminem/Slim Shady also sang about killing his wife. In real life he married Kim Scott in 1999, only for the couple to divorce two years later. She later said he had driven her to try suicide because he made her feel like a 'piece of crap'. But they wed for a second time in 2006, appearing on the front of Hello! and doing nothing to remedy that magazine's fabled 'curse': this time the marriage lasted less than three months.</p> <p>But Eminem's career seemed unstoppable with hits such as 'The Way I Am' and 'Stan' and a cabinet full of awards. He might have been the world's most controversial rapper, but his songs were praised for their theatrical verve, dazzling rhyme schemes and visceral drama. He was interviewed admiringly by the novelist Zadie Smith, while the poet Seamus Heaney said: 'He has created a sense of what is possible. He has sent a voltage around a generation. He has done this not just through his subversive attitude but also his verbal energy.'</p> <p>Even his venture into film, the semi-autobiographical 8 Mile, confounded sceptics and won an Oscar for the song 'Lose Yourself'. After its release in 2002, CNN compared him to James Dean, and The Washington Post declared: 'He has the face of a bruised angel.'</p> <p>His star began to wane with his last solo album, Encore, described as formulaic by critics. An alleged addiction to sleeping pills led to a spell in rehab. But it was the murder in Detroit of his sidekick, Proof, that stopped him in his tracks, as he recounts in an autobiography, The Way I Am, published later this month. Andy Greene, assistant editor of Rolling Stone magazine, who has seen a preview copy, said: 'He talks about Proof's death - it was just devastating. He says he took to his bed for a year and couldn't write and couldn't rhyme. He said he couldn't tour again without Proof.'</p> <p>He reportedly spent four days in hospital last Christmas with pneumonia and heart problems, and also put on five stone. But recent public appearances suggest all that is behind him. Andy Greene added: 'There was a lot of confusion because he was off the grid completely. But he's one of the last true superstars of the music industry. If, as is reported, Dr Dre is producing most of it [Relapse], it will be a very big deal.'</p> <p>Along with Dr Dre, Eminem is reportedly working with fellow hip-hop star 50 Cent on the new album. He was recently quoted as saying: 'For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio. I went through some bad times but I'm coming out of those. It feels good ... I'm writing and producing again, banging out tracks - and the music just gets better and better.'</p> <p>It will have to be. Hip-hop has endured a decline in popularity since his self-imposed exile. The wider fall in CD sales, under pressure from the internet, means it will be hard to measure Relapse against Eminem's previous albums. </p> <p>Can he still sound remotely edgy, or will even his profanities now seem contrived and safe? Will it be worth the four-year wait? The music world holds its breath for the biggest comeback since the Spice Girls. It is safe to say the parallels end there.</p> <h2>Eminem: life and crimes</h2> <p><strong>1972</strong> Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in Missouri on 17 October.

  "<p>Ten years ago, when Gordon Ramsay opened his first restaurant, we spent less than \u00a38 each a week eating out. These days we take food far more seriously, he tells <strong>Elizabeth Day</strong>. It's just a pity there are so many rubbish cookery shows on TV...</p> <p>It is less than an hour after I've walked through his front door that Gordon Ramsay decides to give me a private view of his upper thigh. I am comfortably ensconced on a capacious sofa in his drawing room, surrounded by swathes of sheepskin and giant velveteen pouffes, and we are chatting quite amicably about the business of being a chef when suddenly he stands up, walks over and positions himself slightly too close to my face. </p> <p>t is less than an hour after I've walked through his front door that Gordon Ramsay decides to give me a private view of his upper thigh. I am comfortably ensconced on a capacious sofa in his drawing room, surrounded by swathes of sheepskin and giant velveteen pouffes, and we are chatting quite amicably about the business of being a chef when suddenly he stands up, walks over and positions himself slightly too close to my face. </p> <p>'I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,' he says and then he starts rolling up his shorts, slowly, like a showgirl. I keep thinking he is going to stop, but the shorts inch higher and higher, exposing an increasing expanse of hairy flesh. </p> <p>'I'm in severe pain,' Ramsay groans when the shorts have reached underpants level. 'I'm having constant treatment but if you sit still it causes a blood clot, so I have to get up and move.' It transpires that he has ruptured a thigh muscle. 'I did it on Sunday, at soccer.' A pause. 'At Wembley.' I murmur sympathetically. 'Yeah, it was a charity match for Soccer Aid.' Was he stretchered off? 'Stretchered! F*** off! I carried myself off.' Did they win? He looks momentarily crestfallen. 'No, we lost,' he says quietly.</p> <p>He sits down again. It is a strange little interlude, but also, in its own way, a rather telling one. Ramsay, 41, hates losing, even if it is a charity football match. He also, I think, still feels it necessary to prove himself, to seek affirmation and to court an audience. This is despite the past decade that has seen him collect 12 Michelin stars, an OBE and a personal fortune estimated at \u00a350 million. It is curious, then, that he feels the need to impress a random journalist with the severity of his injuries and the manly fortitude with which he bears them. But it is also endearing.</p> <p>It has been 10 years since he opened his first restaurant, Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road in London and since then he has created a phenomenally successful brand founded on his reputation for blistering machismo and bottomless ambition. Gordon Ramsay Holdings, of which he owns a 69 per cent share, now operates 25 restaurants and pubs across the world, including three in America.</p> <p>Last month a diner had the temerity to ask him whether he was ready to retire. 'I said, \"I beg your pardon? Say that again - retire?\" and he said \"Yeah but you've got your stars, your restaurants, money in the bank...\" I said, \"F***ing retire? I've only just started. I'm 41 years of age. I want to win three stars in New York, three stars in Paris. From a chef's point of view, I would feel I have achieved my ultimate goal.'</p> <p>'On 1 September 1998, when we opened Royal Hospital Road, it was pushing a piece of string up a hill,' he says. 'It was a decade of immense, immense pressure. In 10 years, I can think of six occasions when we've had an empty table in that restaurant and, for me, that speaks volumes about constantly hitting perfection - not sitting on it, but moving forward.'</p> <p>He says he is haunted by a fear of failure, dating back to his youth when a promising football career with Rangers was prematurely halted when he smashed his knee. 'You work so hard in order not to fail. I suppose the drive [I have] was on the back of an experience of failure before cooking - the let-down from Rangers, it doesn't scar you but there's a constant memory and it's always at the back of your mind, it's always there and you can always reach for it in terms of thought when things are going slightly wrong.</p> <p>So having confidence is one thing, but the secret over the past 10 years has been the consistency in terms of what we do, how we do it and how much work we put into it.'</p> <p>No one doubts Ramsay's enormous capacity for work. He has recently returned from a family holiday in Los Angeles, where he has opened a restaurant, at the London West Hollywood Hotel, and was unimpressed by the prevalence of self-help therapy. 'Everyone has a life coach or a motivation coach and it's f***ing really weird. I motivate myself. I grew up on a council estate, that's my motivation.' Ramsay's father was an alcoholic. His mother, who recently underwent a successful heart bypass operation, was a nurse who smoked heavily for 45 years. His brother, Ronald, was jailed last year in Indonesia for possession of heroin.</p> <p>From these inauspicious beginnings, Ramsay has become an unlikely international television celebrity. In LA, he hangs out with David and Victoria Beckham, with whom he has discussed setting up a restaurant together. 'She and I have talked about it and it's more a sort of a table conversation really. I think Victoria's fascinated by restaurants.'</p> <p>But does she actually eat? 'Yes, everything's just steamed. David eats very well and Victoria is, er, just very conscious really - no cream, no butter and just steamed. No dairy. So drizzled olive oil, fresh lemon and lime juice - not everyone's cup of tea.</p> <p>'We had a soup at home, like a vegetable soup and she loved it, I mean really enjoyed it. She said, \"It's so nice, so rich and creamy. There's no cream in there is there?\" I said, \"No!\" But of course, there was.</p> <p>'In LA, no one wants to eat; hardly anyone eats dessert, which is frustrating. We've adapted. I'd say the portions are 10, 12, 15 per cent smaller than they are in New York or London. A lot lighter: less cream, less butter, a lot more fruit involved. Everyone's into crudit\u00e9s there at the moment, which is fine if you're a f***ing rabbit.'</p> <p>Such forthrightness has catapulted Ramsay into culinary superstardom and he is much in demand from advertising companies eager for him to promote their clients' brands.</p> <p>This has led to inevitable grumbling from restaurant critics that he is spreading himself too thinly and not spending enough time in the kitchen. On the morning we meet, Egon Ronay has given a newspaper interview lambasting Ramsay for being a businessman who 'cannot be called a chef when he's not cooking'.</p> <p>Ramsay is furious. It has to be said that he gives exceptionally good rage. I feel I am in the hands of a master of apoplexy and could listen to him fulminate viciously for hours. 'What the f*** would that four-and-a-half-inch dwarf know?' he says, spitting and hissing like an overheated pan of oil. 'He did a guide for motorway cafe stations! I mean: \"Gordon Ramsay's not a chef, he doesn't cook any more\"? Come and f***ing spend a day with me, Egon.' </p> <p>'I'm in f***ing control and in the best position I've been in my f***ing life. I'm on the stove how I want, when I want, who I want to do it with. Retire? At 41? I've got 20 years left.'</p> <p><strong>The thing people forget about Gordon Ramsay</strong> is that, for all the swearing and boiling vitriol, he is also a charmer. When I arrive, he is in the midst of trying out new recipes in his kitchen for a new series, and is surrounded by people from the television company armed with potato peelers and stopwatches. It has totally slipped his mind that he is meant to be doing an interview, but he insists I take a seat at the big wooden dining table until he's finished and offers me coffee at opportune intervals. He is polite and courteous and calls everyone darling. 'Have you met Elizabeth?' he says when his wife, Tana, absent-mindedly potters into the kitchen. </p> <p>Anyway, the delay gives me ample opportunity to nose around his large kitchen, which is dominated by a massive Rorgue cooker and overlooks the garden in which he raised two pigs for The F Word. The walls are hung with framed black and white photographs of his four young children. In one corner is an antique Wurlitzer jukebox. There are packets of Jaffa Cakes and PG Tips on the kitchen counter and bags of Waitrose shopping along one wall, containing packets of vermicelli nests and shop-bought chicken stock. He is unapologetic about this: 'Christ Almighty, have you seen what's in Waitrose lately? Tana showed me some fantastic breadcrumbs she bought there recently. Amazing breadcrumbs. </p> <p>'When a customer can go and buy that level of ingredient, when they can buy a fantastic fillet or ribeye, they want to see a better quality in the restaurant and so they spot the difference instantly which is brilliant - it helps to keep chefs on their toes.'</p> <p>Ramsay says there has been a notable change in British taste over the past 10 years. 'Customers are now more scrutinising than ever before, which makes our life 10 times more exciting because we are no longer a nation to be blas\u00e9 about things. We take food quite seriously now.</p> <p>'The worrying thing is that with the influx of cookery programmes, there's so much shit out there. I've seen some ghastly things recently on Saturday, Sunday morning that from a chef's point of view are embarrassing. We're in danger of becoming over-gimmicky.'</p> <p>Naturally, he doesn't include his own programmes in this generalisation and is about to embark on a new series of Kitchen Nightmares. He tells me an amusing anecdote about the TV production company accidentally sending a letter to Raymond Blanc at Le Manoir Aux Quat' Saisons asking if he would like to take part.</p> <p>'He was on a mailing list and he went f***ing mad,' Ramsay says, laughing. 'I had a message from this Frenchman on my mobile phone in LA in August and it was \"Putain, qu'est-ce que tu fais? Wanker!\" I mean, he didn't see it as a funny joke so I apologised.'</p> <p>Still, by now, I would have thought Ramsay was accustomed to falling out with other chefs. He has a well-nurtured feud with his one-time mentor Marco Pierre White, and, in August, Marcus Wareing, a Ramsay proteg\u00e9e and the former head chef at Petrus, sounded off in an interview, calling him a 'sad bastard' who held back his staff while pursuing a media career.</p> <p>Do these kind of attacks ever upset him? 'I suppose it's frustrating. Is it upsetting? Of course. Do you sit and ponder? You've got to move on. This business is life. Football managers do the same. Marcus is undeniably is a very talented chef. What goes around comes around. I give a lot. I accept a lot. It's amazing how much - not just jealousy - but there's envy out there, too.</p> <p>'It's a very emotional industry and if that's how Marcus felt on the back of nine years [working together], you know, never judge a guy on his emotions.'</p> <p>Tana pops her head around the door to let us know a car is here, waiting outside to whisk him away to his next appointment. </p> <p>Doesn't it ever get exhausting being Gordon? 'The last 10 years - what a whirlwind - it feels like 18 months. Ten more years would take me to 51 and I still wouldn't contemplate stopping. At the age of 41, I finally feel my age. I finally feel I've grown into my face.'</p> <p>So, in spite of the new LA lifestyle, he'd never consider Botox? 'Raymond Blanc has got more chance of winning a third Michelin star. If he managed that then, yeah, I'd have it done.' A pause. 'On my left bollock.' I hope he doesn't. I'm not sure his shorts would roll up that far.</p> <p><strong>Read more from Elizabeth Day on her interview with Ramsay on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/17/raymond.blanc.gordon.ramsay.fight\">food blog</a> and tell us what you think</strong></p> <p>Gordon Ramsay presents Taste of Christmas at Excel London, 4-7 December, tasteofchristmas.com.

  "<p>One of Britain's leading moral philosophers has called for a change in the law to allow assisted suicide in Britain following the death of paralysed rugby player Daniel James. Baroness Warnock, writing in today's Observer, calls for liberalisation of euthanasia laws on the grounds that 'we have a moral obligation to other people to take their seriously reached decisions with regard to their own lives equally seriously'.</p> <p>Her comments come after Mark and Julie James were quizzed this weekend by officers. They had taken their 23-year-old son, Daniel, to a clinic in Switzerland last month where he became the youngest known Briton to have requested an assisted suicide. He had already attempted to kill himself three times after being paralysed from the chest down in a rugby accident. </p> <p>Mary Warnock writes: 'The case of Mr and Mrs James ... presents a legal dilemma. Whether or not they are prosecuted, the law will be challenged. There are many, of whom I am one, who believe that we must try yet again to change the law, not by excluding from criminality those who assist death by taking the suicide abroad, but by liberalising the laws of our own country.'</p> <p>Daniel James, who was described by friends as 'vivacious and warm' before his accident, was injured in March last year while training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. Despite numerous operations to fuse his vertabrae during eight months in hospital, he only regained limited use in his fingers. Last night, his parents were not responding to telephone calls at their farm near Sinton Green, Worcestershire where they live with daughters Georgina, 21, and Olivia, 18. </p> <p>In emails sent in response to a euthanasia debate on a newspaper website, Mrs James criticised the well-meaning person who had alerted the police to Daniel's case. She wrote: 'This person had never met Dan before or after his accident and obviously gave no consideration for our younger daughters who had seen their big brother suffer so much and the day before had to say goodbye to him.</p> <p>'I hope that one day I will get the chance to speak to this lady and ask if she had a son, daughter, father, mother, who could not walk, had no hand function, was incontinent, and relied upon 24-hour care for every basic need and they had asked her for support, what would she have done?!</p> <p>'Our son could not have been more loved and had he felt he could have lived his life this way he would have been loved just the same, but this was his right, as a human being.'</p> <p>In another email, she wrote: 'Whilst not everyone in Dan's situation would find it as unbearable as Dan, what right does any human being have to tell any other that they have to live such a life, filled with terror, discomfort and indignity? What right does one person who chooses to live with a particular illness or disability have to tell another that they should have to?'</p> <p>Police yesterday were preparing a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether Mr or Mrs James should be charged.</p>",
  "<p>Every so often, a famous actor or producer will contact Seymour Hersh, wanting to make a movie about his most famous story: his single-handed uncovering, in 1969, of the My Lai massacre, in which an American platoon stormed a village in South Vietnam and, finding only its elderly, women and children, launched into a frenzy of shooting, stabbing and gang-raping. It won him a Pulitzer prize and hastened the end of the Vietnam war. Mostly, they come to see him in his office in downtown Washington, a two-room suite that he has occupied for the past 17 years. Do they like what they see? You bet they do, even if the movie has yet to be made. 'Brad Pitt loved this place,' says Hersh with a wolfish grin. 'It totally fits the clich\u00e9 of the grungy reporter's den!' When last he renewed the lease, he tells me, he made it a condition of signing that the office would not be redecorated - the idea of moving all his stuff was too much. It's not hard to see why. Slowly, I move my head through 180 degrees, trying not to panic at the sight of so much paper piled so precipitously. Before me are 8,000 legal notepads, or so it seems, each one filled with a Biro Cuneiform of scribbled telephone numbers. By the time I look at Hersh again - the full panorama takes a moment or two - he is silently examining the wall behind his desk, which is grey with grime, and striated as if a billy goat had sharpened its horns on it.</p> <p>And then there is Hersh himself, a splendid sight. After My Lai, he was hired by the New York Times to chase the tail of the Watergate scandal, a story broken by its rival, the Washington Post. In All the President's Men, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's book about their scoop, they describe him - the competition. He was unlike any reporter they'd ever seen: 'Hersh, horn-rimmed and somewhat pudgy, showed up for dinner in old tennis shoes, a frayed pinstriped shirt that might have been at its best in his college freshman year and rumpled, bleached khakis.' Forty years on, little has changed. Today he is in trainers, chinos and a baggy navy sweatshirt and - thanks to a tennis injury - he is walking like an old guy: chest forward, knees bandy, slight limp in one leg. There is something cherishably chaotic about him. A fuzzy halo of frantic inquiry follows him wherever he goes, like the cloud of dust that hovers above Pig Pen in the Charlie Brown strip. In conversation, away from the restraining hand of his bosses at the New Yorker, the magazine that is now his home, his thoughts pour forth, unmediated and - unless you concentrate very hard - seemingly unconnected. 'Yeah, I shoot my mouth off,' he says, with faux remorse. 'There's a huge difference between writing and thinking.' Not that he has much time for those who put cosy pontification over the graft of reporting: 'I think... My colleagues! I watch 'em on TV, and every sentence begins with the words: \"I think.\" They could write a book called I Think.'</p> <p>But we must backtrack a little. Before the office, there is the breakfast joint. Hersh and I meet at the Tabard Inn, a Washington hangout so gloomily lit I could do with a torch. He has poached eggs and coffee and 'none of that other stuff, thanks'. (I think he means that he doesn't want potatoes with his eggs). Like everyone in America just now, he is on tenterhooks. A Democrat who truly despises the Bush regime, he is reluctant to make predictions about exactly what is going to happen in the forthcoming election on the grounds that he might 'jinx it'. The unknown quantity of voter racism apart, however, he is hopeful that Obama will pull it off, and if he does, for Hersh this will be a starting gun. 'You cannot believe how many people have told me to call them on 20 January [the date of the next president's inauguration],' he says, with relish. '[They say:] \"You wanna know about abuses and violations? Call me then.\" So that is what I'll do, so long as nothing awful happens before the inauguration.' He plans to write a book about the neocons and, though it won't change anything - 'They've got away with it, categorically; anyone who talks about prosecuting Bush and Cheney [for war crimes] is kidding themselves' - it will reveal how the White House 'set out to sabotage the system... It wasn't that they found ways to manipulate Congressional oversight; they had conversations about ending the right of Congress to intervene.'</p> <p>In one way, it's amazing Hersh has anything left to say about Bush, Cheney and their antics. Then again, with him, this pushing of a story on and on is standard practice. Though it was Woodward and Bernstein who uncovered the significance of the burglary at the Watergate building, Hersh followed up their scoop by becoming one of Nixon's harshest critics and by breaking stories about how the government had supported Pinochet's 1973 coup in Chile, secretly bombed Cambodia and used the CIA to spy on its domestic enemies. His 1983 book about Nixon, The Price of Power, is definitive. So far as the War on Terror goes, Hersh has already delivered his alternative history - Chain of Command, a book based on the series of stories he wrote for the New Yorker in the aftermath of 9/11 and following Bush's invasion of Iraq. Among other things, Hersh told us of the bungled efforts to catch Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan; of the dubious business dealings of the superhawk Richard Perle - a report that led to Perle's resignation as chairman of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board (Hersh alleged that Perle improperly mixed his business affairs with his influence over US foreign policy when he met the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in 2003. Perle described Hersh as 'the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist' and threatened to sue before falling oddly silent); and of how Saddam's famous efforts to buy uranium in Africa, as quoted by President Bush in his 2003 State of the Union speech, were a fiction. Most electrifying of all, however, was his triple salvo on the abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib. It was Hersh who first revealed the full extent of this torture, for which he traced the ultimate responsibility carefully back to the upper reaches of the administration. 'In each successive report,' writes David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker, in his introduction to Chain of Command, 'it became clear that Abu Ghraib was not an \"isolated incident\" but, rather, a concerted attempt by the government and the military leadership to circumvent the Geneva Conventions in order to extract intelligence and quell the Iraqi insurgency.' As Remnick points out, this reporting has 'stood up over time and in the face of a president whose calumny has turned out to be a kind of endorsement'. Bush reportedly told Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, that Hersh was 'a liar'; after the third of his reports on Abu Ghraib, a Pentagon spokesman announced that Hersh merely 'threw a lot of crap against the wall and he expects someone to peel off what's real. It's a tapestry of nonsense.'</p> <p>Earlier this year, Hersh turned his attention to Iran: to Bush's desire to bomb it and to America's covert operations there. But while Hersh believes the President would still dearly love to go after Iran, the danger of that actually happening has now passed. Events, not least the sinking of the global economy, have moved on. So he is shortly to write about Syria instead, which he has recently visited. In the dying days of the Bush administration, he says, it is noticeably easier to meet contacts - Cheney, the enforcer, is a lot less powerful - and the information he is getting is good. By coincidence, it was in Syria that he first heard about what was going on inside Abu Ghraib, long before he saw documentary evidence of it. 'I got in touch with a guy inside Iraq during the Prague Spring after the fall of Baghdad, a two-star guy from the old regime. He came up to Damascus by cab. We talked for four days, and one of the things we talked about was prisons. He told me that some of the women inside had been sending messages to their fathers and brothers asking them to come and kill them because they'd been molested. I didn't know whether it was GIs playing grab ass or what, but it was clear that the women had been shamed. So when I first heard about the photographs, I knew they were real. Did I think the story would be as big as it was? Yeah. But was it as big as My Lai? No.' Only a handful of relatively lowly military personnel have so far been punished for their part in the abuse, and Colonel Janis Karpinski, the commander of the Iraqi prisons, was merely demoted (from Brigadier General), in spite of the fact that the Taguba Report, the internal US army report on detainee abuse that was leaked to Hersh, singled her out for blame. 'And John Kerry wouldn't even use it [Abu Ghraib] in his campaign. He didn't want to offend the military, I assume.'</p> <p>Four decades separate My Lai and Abu Ghraib. You have to ask: wasn't it appalling for him to be investigating US army abuses of civilians all over again? Didn't he think that lessons might have been learnt? Yes, and no. It made him feel 'hopeless', but on the other hand, war is always horrible. In 1970, after his My Lai story, he addressed an anti-war rally and, on the spur of the moment, asked a veteran to come up and tell the crowd what some soldiers would do on their way home after a day spent moving their wounded boys. With little prompting, the traumatised vet described how they would buzz farmers with their helicopter blades, sometimes decapitating them; they would then clean up the helicopter before they landed back at base. 'That's what war is like,' he says. 'But how do you write about that? How do you tell the American people that?' Still, better to attempt to tell people than to stay feebly silent. What really gets Hersh going - he seems genuinely bewildered by it - is the complicit meekness, the virtual collapse, in fact, of the American press since 9/11. In particular, he disdains its failure to question the 'evidence' surrounding Saddam's so-called weapons of mass destruction. 'When I see the New York Times now, it's so shocking to me. I joined the Times in 1972, and I came with the mark of Cain on me because I was clearly against the war. But my editor, Abe Rosenthal, he hired me because he liked stories. He used to come to the Washington bureau and almost literally pat me on the head and say: \"How is my little Commie today? What do you have for me?\" Somehow, now, reporters aren't able to get stories in. It was stunning to me how many good, rational people - people I respect - supported going into war in Iraq. And it was stunning to me how many people thought you could go to war against an idea.'</p> <p>As for the troop 'surge' and its putative success, he more or less rolls his eyes when I bring this up. 'People are saying quietly that they are worried about Iraq. This is nothing profound, but by the time the surge got going, ethnic cleansing had already happened in a lot of places. There was a natural lull in the violence. The moment we start withdrawing, and relying on the Shia to start paying members of the Awakening [the alliance of Sunni insurgents whose salaries were initially paid by the US military, and who have helped to reduce violence in some provinces]...' His voice trails off. 'And the big bad bogeyman is Saudi Arabia. There's an awful lot of money going to Salafist and Wahabist charities, and there's no question they'll pour money into the Awakening, and they're so hostile to Shi'ism and to Iran that how can you possibly predict anything other than violence? How do we get out of this? There is no way out. We have a moral obligation to the people of Iraq that goes beyond anything that anyone's talking about. The notion that it's their problem, that we should just leave... I mean, can you believe what we've done to their society? Imagine the psychosis, the insanity, that we've induced.' He stabs the yolk of one of his poached eggs, and sets about his toast like he hasn't eaten in days.</p> <p>Seymour M Hersh (the M is for Myron) was born in Chicago, the son of Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Lithuania and Poland (he has a twin brother, a physicist, and two sisters, also twins). The family was not rich; his father, who died when Seymour was 17, ran a dry-cleaning business. After school he attended a local junior college until a professor took him aside, asked him what he was doing there and walked him up to the University of Chicago. 'Chicago was this great egghead place,' Hersh says. 'But I knew nothing. I came out of a lower-middle-class background. At that time, everyone used to define themselves: Stalinist, Maoist, whatever. I thought they meant \"miaowist\". Seriously! Something to do with cats. Among my peers, they all thought I would write the great novel, because I was very quick and cutting. I've just read Philip Roth's new novel [Indignation], and the arrogance of his character reminded me of that certitude. I was always pointing out other people's flaws.' He went to law school but hated it, dropped out and wound up as a copy boy, then a reporter for the local City News Bureau. Later he joined Associated Press in Washington and rose through its ranks until he quit for a stint working for the Democrat senator Eugene McCarthy. Pretty soon, though, he was back in journalism. 'Using words to make other people less big made me feel bigger, though the psychological dimension to that... well, I don't want to explore it.' His wife of 40 years, Elizabeth, whom he describes as 'the love of my life' in the acknowledgements of Chain of Command (they have three grown-up children), is a psychoanalyst. Doesn't she ever tell him about his ego and his id? He looks embarrassed. 'No, no... marriage is... different. When you live with someone you don't... The hardest part for her is when she tells me to take out the garbage and I say: \"Excuse me? I don't have time. I'm saving the world.\"' Later, however, he tells me that journalism, like psychoanalysis, is about 'bringing things into focus'. </p> <p>He was a broke freelance working for a new syndication agency when he got wind of My Lai. A military lawyer told him that a soldier at Fort Benning, a Georgia army base, was facing a court martial for murdering at least 109 Vietnamese civilians. Hersh rocked up in Benning and went on a door-to-door search, somehow avoiding the officers on base, until he found Lieutenant William L Calley Jr, a boyish 26-year-old otherwise known as Rusty. He asked the former railway pointsman if they could talk, which they did, for three hours. They then went to the grocery store, got steaks, bourbon and wine, and talked some more at the apartment of Calley's girlfriend. Calley told Hersh that he had only been following orders, but nevertheless he described what had happened (it later turned out that soldiers of the 11th Brigade killed 500 or more civilians that morning). Soon after, 36 newspapers ran the story under Hersh's byline. Some, however, did not carry it, in spite of the fact that Calley's own lawyer had confirmed it, among them the New York Times. The scoop caused not only horror but disbelief. Hersh, though, was not to be put off. 'By the third story, I found this amazing fellow, Paul Meadlo, from a small town in Indiana, a farm kid, who had actually shot many of the Vietnamese kids - he'd shot maybe 100 people. He just kept on shooting and shooting, and then the next day he had his leg blown off, and he told Calley, as they medevac-ed him: \"God has punished me and now he will punish you.\"' Hersh wrote this up, CBS put Meadlo on the TV news, and finally the story could no longer be ignored. The next year, 1970, he was awarded the Pulitzer prize. </p> <p>How does Hersh operate? The same way as he's always done: it's all down to contacts. Unlike Bob Woodward, however, whose recent books about Iraq have involved long and somewhat pally chats with the President, Hersh gets his stuff from lower down the food chain. Woodward was one of those who was convinced that WMD would be found in Iraq. 'He does report top dollar,' says Hersh. 'I don't go to the top because I think it's sorta useless. I see people at six o'clock in the morning somewhere, unofficially.' Are they mostly people he has known for a long time? 'No, I do pick up new people.' But with new contacts he must be wary; there is always the danger of a plant. His critics point to what they regard as his excessive use of unnamed sources. Others accuse him of getting things wrong and of being gullible. A low point came in the Nineties, when he embarked on a book about Kennedy, The Dark Side of Camelot. Hersh was shown documents that alleged the President was being blackmailed by Marilyn Monroe, and though he discovered that they were fake in time to remove all mention of them from his book, the damage to his reputation had already been done - and the critics let rip anyway, for his excitable portrayal of JFK as a sex addict and bigamist. There was also the time, in 1974, when he accused the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, of being in on a CIA plot to overthrow President Allende. Some years later, Hersh had to write a long correction; it ran on page one of the New York Times. As a Jew, his mailbag since 9/11 has also included letters from readers who denounce him as a self-hater (later, at this office, he shows me one of these: its author, an MD with a Florida postcode, accuses him of being a 'kapo' - the kapo were concentration camp prisoners who worked for the Nazis in exchange for meagre privileges). </p> <p>His supporters, though, believe that his mistakes - and even the wilder allegations he sometimes makes in speeches - should always be put in the context of his hit rate. A former Washington Post reporter, Scott Armstrong, once put it this way. Say he writes a story about how an elephant knocked someone down in a dark room. 'If it was a camel, or three cows, what difference does it make? It was dark, and it wasn't supposed to be there.' Hersh himself points out that, since 1993, he has been up against the stringent standards of the New Yorker and its legendary team of fact checkers. 'By the way, all my inside sources have to deal with the fact checkers, and they do. People find it hard to believe that, I don't know why.' And then there is his editor, David Remnick. 'I never love editors,' he says. 'But David is smart and he has great judgement.' How often does he check in with Remnick? 'I'm sure he would tell you less often than I should. He gets pretty angry with me. Sometimes we have these rows where I won't take his calls. He says no to a lot of stuff - stuff I think the editor would die for! Admittedly, it is not the Seymour Hersh weekly. But sometimes he'll say: \"We are not going to publish this kind of stuff 'cos it's frigging crazy.\"' It was Tina Brown, formerly of Tatler and Vanity Fair, who brought him to the New Yorker. 'What's-her-name... yeah, Tina. She gave me a lot of money, and she said: \"Just go do it!\" But she used to worry. She'd call me up and say, \"I sat next to Colin Powell at dinner last night and he was railing about how awful you are.\" So I would say, \"Well, that's good.\" And she'd say, \"Is it?\" And I'd tell her, \"Yes, it is.\"'</p> <p>Does it worry him that he is sometimes described as the 'last American reporter'? Who is coming up behind him? 'A friend of mine wants to put $5m into a chair for investigative journalism for me, but why would I want to do that? Look, the cost of running my kind of work is very high, and a lot of stories don't even work out. I know a wonderful journalist who works on the internet. I called friends of mine at the Times and the Post. But he hasn't been hired because he would cost a lot of money.' But Hersh is in his seventies (he is a year younger than John McCain, though you'd never know), he can't keep going forever. Or can he? Most reporters start out hungry but somewhere along the way are sated. Not Hersh. 'I have information; I have people who trust me. What else am I going to do? I love golf and tennis and if I was good enough, I'd be professional. Since I'm not, what am I gonna do? Why shouldn't I be energetic? Our whole country is at stake. We have never had a situation like this. These men have completely ruined America. It's so depressing, my business!' Yet he seems chipper. 'No, I'm not chipper. I don't know how to put where I am... I don't take it that seriously. I've been there: up, down, back up. I do a lotta speeches, I make a lotta money, I proselytise.' Does he like making money? 'Are you kidding? I do!'</p> <p>After we finish breakfast, he takes me to the office. He is eager to put off the moment when he must get on with his Syria piece. The more time he wastes with me... well, the morning will soon be over. Inside he points out a few choice interior-design details - the Pulitzer (it nestles among dozens of other awards), the framed memo from Lawrence Eagleburger and Robert McCloskey to Henry Kissinger, their boss at the State Department, which is dated 24 September 1974, and reads: 'We believe Seymour Hersh intends to publish further allegations on the CIA in Chile. He will not put an end to this campaign. You are his ultimate target.' Then he roots around in a cairn of paper for a while - quite a long while - eventually producing a proof of one of his articles with Remnick's editing marks on it. I've never seen anything so harsh in my life. Practically every other sentence has been ruthlessly disembowelled. 'Yeah, pretty tough, huh?' He also shows me one of his own memos to a contact. It makes reference to the current administration. 'These guys are hard-wired and drinking the Kool-Aid,' it says, deadpan. He laughs. He's getting cheerier by the minute. Soon it will be time for lunch! Now he puts his feet on the desk, removes one training shoe and jauntily waves the sweaty sole of a white sock at me. A couple of calls come in. He is concise bordering on cryptic. Finally an old Times colleague arrives. 'I knew this guy when he had hair!' Hersh shouts as this fellow and I pass in a small area of floorspace not yet covered by books or papers. I'm leaving, but Hersh doesn't get up and he doesn't say goodbye. A breezy salute - and then his eyes fall ravenously on his pal.</p>",

Starting as a secretary, the 54-year-old penetrated the male dominated preserve of technology companies by drinking beer mugs of vodka and attending meetings held in strip clubs to shatter the glass ceiling as no other woman had ever done in America.</p> <p>It is an achievement that still stands even if it ended in humiliation. Fiorina was forced unceremoniously to bid farewell to her $3m salary and the corporate jets after a merger she had bulldozed through caused Hewlett-Packard to lose an estimated $14bn in value. </p> <p>Still, Fiorina has since dusted herself down. A long standing friendship with McCain has led her to reinvent herself as 'Carly the politician', giving much needed ballast to his economic team - an area in which McCain himself confessed he was no expert. </p> <p>The talk was that Fiorina was being lined up to become Treasury Secretary. And then, last month, disaster. On a radio interview, Fiorina was asked whether she thought Sarah Palin had the experience to run a large US corporation as she had done. 'No I don't,' Fiorina replied. 'That's not what she is running for.' Later, on television, she was asked to clarify those remarks and she compounded the error by saying: 'Well, I don't think John McCain could run a major corporation.'</p> <p>The comments could not have come at a worse time. Even as the markets were collapsing and voters were losing their jobs, savings and homes, a key figure in McCain's team was questioning the candidate's experience. Since 17 September McCain's lead has disappeared. Obama has not looked back. </p> <p>A well-placed Republican insider said: 'This is the most intense campaign and you have to surround yourself with experienced people. She does not qualify in that department. She's not a political person. </p> <p>'For McCain it has to be a seriously calculated, strategic team. She's very bright and a good executive, but politics is not as easy as people think. It's a lot tougher even if you are a smart woman.'</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Fiorina is furious about the incident. 'Do you know what I said?' she asks. 'The Obama campaign literally cut and pasted those remarks to say what they wanted. They pushed it on the radar. I was given a silly question. I gave a hypothetical answer.' </p> <p>But McCain has another big problem with Fiorina, and it dates back to her sudden departure from Hewlett-Packard after winning a bitter merger battle with rival computer giant Compaq.</p> <p>The saga ended in Fiorina being summarily dismissed as she was preparing to fly to the Swiss Alpine resort of Davos for the meeting of world leaders and the business elite. But she received an estimated $24m severance package.</p> <p>To many, this is an example of rewarding failure. Not to Fiorina, though, whose self-belief remains intact. After all, the subsequent performance of HP, she says, more than vindicates her merger strategy. And it is true that analysts recommend HP shares as a defensive bulwark in plunging markets. But her huge payout has drawn comparisons to the rewards Wall Street bankers have scooped as markets collapse. </p> <p>'My pay package, which Obama has falsely stated, was voted on by shareholders. It's a matter of public record. The way it was handled is the way McCain believes it should be handled.' </p> <p>But isn't the financial crisis caused in part by the style of buccaneering capitalism you epitomised? 'I completely reject that,' she says. 'The current financial crisis has been caused by people lacking in common sense and judgment, greed, unethical behaviour and a fixation with short-term stock prices by everybody from analysts and investors. We had people betting the farm that real estate would rise forever.'</p> <p>It is the kind of homespun talk that could win over voters, but they don't appear to be listening to her or McCain. Voters see the dotcom collapse, the failure of Enron and the present crisis as three financial disasters under a Republican administration. 'Greed is a bipartisan affliction. It's not about political parties. When business people lose common sense, that's a problem,' she says.</p> <p>According to Fiorina, 'the great problem is markets not having confidence with decisions they made'. Is this a criticism of George Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson? 'I think right now, people are doing their best whether it's Gordon Brown or Hank Paulson. There's plenty of blame to go around.'</p> <p>As the US and Europe sink under a wave of debt, there is an increasing sense that American global dominance is disintegrating. So much for the neo-conservative vision of a 21st century ruled by the United States.</p> <p>'Asia without question is emerging as a financial powerhouse. This certainly is different to the 20th century. But American leadership is going to depend on the same things it always has. Innovation and entrepreneurial spirit,' says Fiorina. 'Political power is based on economic power. As long as the US is innovative our growth will be assured.'</p> <p>But will it be a US with McCain as its leader? He's 72. He must be pretty tired. 'They're all getting pretty tired. They have been doing this for two years. But John McCain is a great fighter. He is a man of extraordinary strength and vigour. He described this process as a privilege. He will fight to the last day.'</p> <p>Republican insiders now believe that even if McCain does pull off a victory, Fiorina is no longer in line for the Treasury Secretary's job she covets but a position as an ambassador or some other junior role.</p> <p>That would be a disappointment to the woman who accepts that she 'had to do crazy things to function in a man's world'. When she attended that meeting in a strip club she said her male colleague attempted to intimidate her. But she 'focused on the job' because 'every day you have to earn your stripes'.</p> <p>Twice married, she seems to live by buzzwords and motivational phrases. 'Tough choices, inspired commitment, real results,' her website proclaims. In two weeks, the eyes of the world will be focusing on just one result. But will Fiorina's role in the race to the White House have helped or hindered her man?</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Name</strong> Cara Carleton Sneed Fiorina, known as Carly Fiorina</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> 1954 in Austin, Texas</p> <p><strong>Education</strong>: BA in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University; MBA in marketing from the University of Maryland; MSc in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management </p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Joined AT&amp;T in 1980 as a management trainee and rose to become a senior vice-president. 1995-99: Lucent Technologies. 1999-2005: Hewlett-Packard chief executive </p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Frank Fiorina for 23 years</p> <p>\u2022 Carly Fiorina will be speaking at the International Leadership Summit in London on 3 and 4 December.

  "<p>Sir Fred Goodwin, departing chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, called it 'more of a drive-by shooting' than a negotiation; another banking executive likened it to lobbing a nuclear bomb at the industry.</p> <p>The military analogies are appropriate enough. Five men have so far fallen victim to the \u00a337bn rescue package drawn up by the government to rescue three of Britain's biggest banks - Sir Fred, his chairman Sir Tom McKillop, and Johnny Cameron, the head of his investment banking arm, along with HBOS's chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executive Andy Hornby. And the pain of the bail-out will have spread far further before the banks can claim to have returned to health.</p> <p>There are the taxpayers, for example, who are already coughing up some \u00a36,700 each to finance the \u00a3400bn rescue plan and are likely to face the lethal combination of higher taxes to fund the deal and rising unemployment as the banks are forced to retrench, restructure and repair the damage from two decades of profligate expansion. </p> <p>Some of that unemployment will emanate from the banks themselves. Stephen Hester, the British Land chief executive parachuted in to take over from Goodwin, will not reveal the detail of his strategy until the new year. But it is already clear that large swathes of the business will be deemed too risky and capital-intensive - including areas such as syndicated loans, structured credit and proprietary trading. That could mean significant job losses among the 25,000 employees of the global markets and investment banking business.</p> <p>He is also likely to be looking for businesses to sell. The sale of the Direct Line and Churchill insurance businesses is already well under way, but some have suggested that he may even consider selling Citizens, its US banking business - though insiders point out that its largely retail franchise is a reliable source of capital.</p> <p>Hester himself says that the business will have to become more focused on the UK - last year, 40 per cent of its revenues came from outside Britain, and that was before the acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro - although he insists that does not mean it will shed all its overseas assets. </p> <p>The cuts will not be confined to RBS: staff at HBOS and Lloyds TSB - and even Barclays - are likely to be waiting nervously for the tap on the shoulder and the redundancy letter. Lloyds' chief Eric Daniels has dismissed earlier suggestions that as many as 40,000 of the combined 140,000 workforce are under threat as a result of the merger, but the stark profits warning that accompanied HBOS's \u00a312bn capital-raising from the government suggests that there could end up being even more casualties as Britain's biggest mortgage lender is forced into a painful retrenchment.</p> <p>HBOS says there has been a 'significant deterioration in credit conditions and falling property prices with associated increased provisioning'. It added that profits would also be hit by more write-offs on toxic loans and higher funding costs. That alone would have justified Lloyds TSB rewriting the terms of its acquisition had Daniels not already got a cast-iron excuse: while Hornby had asked the government for just \u00a33bn, the government - backed by the regulators - insisted it needed four times that, more than double what Lloyds TSB itself is raising. Combined with the collapse in HBOS's share price since the deal was announced, Daniels barely had to bother with brinkmanship tactics as Hornby and Stevenson quickly realised they had nothing left to bargain with. They had no choice but to accept a scaling-back of the offer from 0.833 Lloyds shares for every HBOS one to 0.605.</p> <p>Despite the downgrading, Daniels will have to work hard to prove it was a bargain. Two months ago, his bank was being hailed as one of the few survivors from the bruising credit crunch: its focus on the UK market and conservative lending strategy meant it had avoided the high-risk lending and toxic assets that have brought rivals to their knees.</p> <p>But its takeover of HBOS has highlighted its own short-term financing problems: while HBOS was the most dependent of the remaining high-street banks on raising funds from the wholesale markets, rather than from depositors, Lloyds is next in line: combining the two simply makes Lloyds TSB more risky.</p> <p>As Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, says, the government's rescue package has exposed 'one myth - that of Lloyds TSB's supposed superior ability to raise capital and funding. Lloyds TSB is now completely reliant on the good faith of the government if it wishes to pay a dividend to ordinary shareholders at any point in the next five years before it is able to call the preference shares itself.'</p> <p>The dividend issue is a particularly contentious one: while banks and their investors are pressing the government to water down its condition that the banks repay the \u00a39.5bn of preference shares being issued as part of the deal, the government is reluctant to allow any concessions which mean that shareholders take money out of the company while taxpayers are still providing support. But without at least some prospect of a dividend, it will be hard to persuade existing investors to take up any of the new shares, increasing the cost to the taxpayer. That means some reinterpretation of the rules looks inevitable. </p> <p>The 'gold-plated' capital requirements set by the government meant that Barclays chief executive John Varley decided against taking up the government's offer to subscribe for preference shares, preferring instead to raise \u00a36.6bn from existing and new shareholders by next March. He has been making the most of his bank's ability to go it alone, claiming that his rivals will be 'hobbled' by what is effectively state control; if existing shareholders eschew the capital-raising, the government will end up with close to 60 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and more than 40 per cent of a combined HBOS and Lloyds TSB. </p> <p>Certainly, Barclays appears to have escaped too much damage from the crisis. RBS joined HBOS in issuing a stark profits warning, saying its results will be below what it expected when it announced interim results in July and warns that there could be more write-downs to come - particularly, the City assumes, with a new chief executive at the helm. Barclays, by contrast, said its profit in September had 'significantly exceeded' the run-rate for the first six months of the year. Bob Diamond, its forceful president and head of its capital markets business, has also won plaudits for 'bottom-fishing' by buying the US business of Lehman Brothers from the receivers after it went bust last month.</p> <p>But the Exane analysts point out that its write-downs are markedly lower than at RBS. While the Scottish bank has written its holding of asset-backed securities and other toxic mortgage assets down to as little as 21p in the pound, Barclays' are still at more than 60p. While that may reflect older, and therefore better-quality, holdings, there is still considerable suspicion that far more provisions will be needed.</p>",
  "<p>Ivan, a thick-set Serbian ex-military policeman who now works as a bodyguard for foreign companies in northern Iraq, has a good sense of humour. He jokes that the country is 'boring' now. Before commercial flights to the country started after the 2003 war, he and his twin brother Stojan used to ferry European businessmen in heavily armed convoys across the mountainous and largely lawless border from Turkey into Iraq. 'That was fun,' he smiled wistfully. But though security in Iraq has since improved, for Westerners it is still one of the most dangerous places on earth. 'Last week I had to eliminate someone,' he explains, without going into detail. The foreign businessmen who have just stepped off the plane at Erbil airport in the north of the country decide against pressing him further. He hands his new charges body armour and then they join their round-the-clock heavily armed security detail. It's a unique welcome, Iraq-style. </p> <p>On Monday, in more serene surroundings at the Sheraton Park Lane opposite Buckingham Palace in London, Hussain al-Shahristani, Iraq's oil minister, met executives from Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Total and dozens of other foreign oil companies. On the table were eight contracts to develop Iraq's eight largest oil fields, which Baghdad hopes will almost double the country's production to 4.5 million barrels of oil per day (bpd). Last month, Shell agreed to invest up to $4bn to form a joint venture to produce gas in the south. It has also become the first oil major to open a permanent office in Baghdad, though most foreign oil executives remain reluctant to visit the capital because of safety fears, despite pressure from the Iraqi oil ministry to attend meetings there. Five years after the US-led invasion of the country, the long-awaited - and controversial - foreign-led development of Iraq's vast oil resources looks set to begin in earnest. </p> <p>But as security improves and Baghdad starts to draw up contracts, many questions remain, says Samuel Ciszuk of Global Insight. Addax Petroleum, a Swiss oil company, is one of a handful of small foreign firms already operating in Iraq. Managers at its huge Taq Taq field near Erbil know from experience that Iraq is not an easy place to do business. There has been no production at the field since July because the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which governs the semi-autonomous region, has not extended the company's licence. </p> <p>More importantly, the longer-term plans of Addax and its Turkish partner, Genel Enerji, to increase production at the site to 150,000 bpd are clouded in uncertainty. No pipeline runs from the field, so trucks have to carry the oil, selling it to the local market, usually at a discount to going rates. Addax says that only a maximum of 60,000 bpd can be moved this way. But no construction work on a pipeline has begun because Baghdad has banned the KRG from exporting oil from the region. The ban will only be lifted once the long-awaited national oil legislation - which will set out who controls the oil and how to exploit it - is passed. The problem is, Baghdad and the KRG have been locked in stalemate over the new law for the past two years, and no one knows when it may get signed.</p> <p>Herish Muharam Muhamad, chairman of the regional board of investment, was adamant when he spoke to The Observer that the KRG should have control over the region's oil. 'When we talk about oil and natural resources, we are talking about our constitutional rights,' he said. 'If our friends in the rest of Iraq think we should not be doing this, it's not our problem.' The continuing stand-off leaves companies like Addax in limbo. </p> <p>The oil majors are also anxiously watching the tortuous negotiations, which continued last week. The eight contracts outlined in London on Monday offer attractive terms, but the worry is that the new oil legislation - whenever it is passed - could change the terms retrospectively. </p> <p>Despite the problems, Iraq remains hugely attractive. It holds an estimated 112 billion barrels of reserves, the second largest in the world. Much of the country remains unexplored and production costs are among the lowest in the world. With resource nationalism limiting the opportunities for oil majors to boost their production, Iraq is a valuable prize. </p> <p>But foreign oil companies have to tread warily in a country often suspicious of their motives. Baghdad has refused to offer production-sharing agreements - preferred by companies as they allow them to book a share of a country's reserves - because Iraq wants to retain sovereignty over its oil. John McKeon, a former director of Circle Oil who knows Iraq well, says: 'The Iraqis are suspicious of the foreign companies and who is behind them. They want to get a good deal for the nation.'</p> <p>When Addax executives visited Shiwashok, a dusty village of primitive huts near its Taq Taq field, Mr Sadi, a village elder, told company executives about the severe summer drought and asked for more water supplies from the company. They promised to oblige. In a complicated country, Addax - like all foreign oil companies in Iraq - knows it needs support with the KRG, Baghdad and among ordinary Iraqis for its gamble to pay off.</p>",
  "<p>When I decided to give up shopping for a year, it was all about the grand environmental gesture. I'd already made a start. I gave up eating fish six years ago, and then flying four years later, and I wanted to stretch my commitment a little further, to see if I could do without something that I've always enjoyed. Or at least assumed I had. </p> <p>I didn't give much thought to what it would involve at first; I just wanted to lighten the load of those vast, smoke-belching cargo ships by a few T-shirts, some kids' toys, maybe a dress or two. As a bonus, it gave me something vaguely shocking to talk about in the months running up to Christmas, when the other mothers at the school gate were discussing the interminable progress of their seasonal shopping. </p> <p>By the time New Year came, I'd told too many people to turn back. So I gritted my teeth, hid my credit card, and set the parameters of my pledge. From midnight on 1 January, for one year, I would not buy anything that wasn't strictly necessary. Food was all right, obviously, and other consumables - light bulbs, washing powder, loo paper and diesel. Magazines and greetings cards were out; stamps in. Children's games and toys were verboten; their clothes, when strictly necessary, would be second-hand, but their shoes could be new. My only luxuries were books - used or borrowed where possible - and anything that might grow into something edible. </p> <p>The first week was fairly easy. I revelled in self-denial, and only felt a pang when I had to walk past a window display in our local Wiltshire town of cut-price James jeans. The few occasions on which I nearly broke my promise were a result of absent-mindedness: it didn't occur to me until I was about to hand over the cash that buying a pen or a roll of Sellotape from the post office counted as shopping. I carefully wrote down everything I would ordinarily have bought. Week one: \u00a3128.50 (jeans, \u00a3125, stationery \u00a33.50).</p> <p>By week two, I was beginning to feel antsy. Half of my socks had gone AWOL (\u00a37.99 for three new pairs), one of my wellies was leaking (\u00a320), and Alfie, 7, and Notty, 5, were already talking about their birthdays (in July). I wasn't sure I could cope with a semi-permanent wet foot, or work out whether our children were going to be ignored in the playground if they missed out on the latest gizmo or Harry Potter Top Trumps. I realised to what extent I had always relied on being able to buy - within reason - what I thought I needed. </p> <p>In The Wealth of Nations, the economist Adam Smith lamented our passion for shopping: 'How many people ruin themselves by laying out money on trinkets of frivolous utility?' he wrote. 'All their pockets are stuffed with little conveniences. They contrive new pockets... in order to carry a greater number. They walk about loaded with baubles ... some of which may sometimes be of little use, but all of which might at all times be very well spared, and of which the whole utility is certainly not worth the fatigue of bearing the burden.'</p> <p>That was in 1776. Two and a bit centuries later, when I was reading Economics at university, we respected - even revered - Smith. But he didn't seem to be relevant to what was happening to us. Thatcher was in power and everyone was being encouraged to spend; to use their purchasing power to drive the economy - both domestic and international - in the belief that the benefits would trickle down. By buying a new chair, we were not only deriving use and pleasure from sitting on it, but supporting the companies that made and sold it; the designers, woodworkers, upholsterers, polishers, sales assistants, and even the window cleaners who made sure the shop windows shone. </p> <p>And so, confident that our money (debt) was being put to good use, we bought more chairs, a table for them to go round, cushions, candlesticks, knives, forks, cookery books, and party hats. Fresh out of university, with my first proper pay packet, I entered into the spirit with a certain gusto; I developed a taste for new and fashionable clothes, and pretty things for my flat. I never had a problem per se, but I'd spend to the limit of my overdraft capacity. </p> <p>It seemed to be worth it. I got a kick out of the stuff I bought; the new rags or bibelots made me feel thinner and prettier, even wittier. And once their lustre began to fade, once they were no longer new, I could just go and buy some more, and cram the out-of-favour things into ever fuller cupboards - or more pockets, as Smith would have it. I never thought about the damaging effect that my shopping might have on anyone - or anything - else, certainly not on the already fraying resources of the planet.</p> <p>I wasn't alone. Until this year, we Britons were on what seemed to be a non-stop, downhill spender-coaster ride. In 2007, UK total retail spending (defined by the Office of National Statistics as all goods sold to the general public for household consumption) stood at \u00a3265bn - about a third of GDP - of which food accounted for a little under 10 per cent. A significant proportion of the rest went on baubles: handbags, digital SLRs, breadmakers, Nintendo Wiis. As long as we kept shopping, the economy continued to grow. As house prices went up, property owners felt richer, and spent more. And so we kept spinning upwards and outwards, like a hurricane heading for Houston.</p> <p>On that scale, I must have been somewhere south of Jamaica by the end of last year. Looking round our small house, I realised it was literally brimming with stuff; some stuff that we loved, that brought back memories of wonderful places and times, but other things that we now didn't use, or even notice, frippery that we'd worked hard to afford, but which brought us only fleeting happiness. Not only did we have nowhere to put it, it seemed to be multiplying. I'd never really stopped buying long enough to wonder what it was that drove my acquisitional urges.</p> <p>My first London trip of 2008, at the end of January, provided part of the answer. Walking along Westbourne Grove between appointments, I felt an almost magnetic force trying to pull me into the shops. Had I not been Not Shopping, I would have walked away with a skirt and cardigan from Jigsaw (\u00a3150), some woolly tights for Notty (\u00a35), make-up essentials totalling \u00a348 (to replace what I'd left at home), and a handful of pretty postcards. I realised to what extent I used to wander into shops as a way of filling time, invariably walking away with some purchase. Or to reward myself for a new commission or contract - spending the fee well before the cheque arrived. Or to make me feel better about some disappointment or other. Shopping was both a habit and a fillip.</p> <p>And it invariably worked. For a time, anyway. New clothes, particularly, had a way of lifting my confidence. As Thorstein Veblen wrote in The Theory of the Leisure Class in 1899: 'It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most items of consumption, that people will undergo a very high degree of privation ... in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.'</p> <p>Judging by the typical Saturday night in Chippenham, even in mid-winter, a remarkable number of people wish to appear well-dressed.</p> <p>By the beginning of February, the satisfaction I garnered from Not Shopping had begun to unravel into an almost overwhelming urge to buy something, anything. In the garage, I nearly forked out \u00a37.99 on an FM radio pedometer, and \u00a32.99 for some light-up tweezers. The sun came out and it felt like biking weather. But Notty had grown too much to fit in the child seat behind my bike - but not enough to ride Alf's old one. What we needed, obviously, was a tag-along. </p> <p>I embarked on the first of countless debates with my conscience. Surely, a tag-along (\u00a375) was a necessity? We could then bike to friends' houses and the shop, even occasionally the five miles to school? The carbon saving would soon wipe out the cost - financial and environmental - of the bike. Or was it just that I wanted to spend some money?</p> <p>That night, to shore up my resolve, I dug out my old bank statements. When I checked this January against last, I discovered, to equal satisfaction and horror, that I'd spent nearly \u00a3500 less. That's \u00a3486 I spent last January on stuff that, for the most part, I can't remember buying, and which, on next year's accounts, would have been listed as 'extraneous personal and household' expenditure. The average per capita income of a Kenyan last year was \u00a3175.</p> <p>It was at that time that the economic storm clouds started to rumble. Northern Rock had been effectively nationalised, and the term 'credit crunch' had entered our lexicon, although it still seemed far away from the bustling shops in the towns around us. It dawned on me how lucky I was to be in a position to give up shopping - or should it be to take up Not Shopping, like a banker's wife takes up Pilates or street children? I felt suddenly rather ashamed, squeezed between those for whom even essential shopping is a push, and others who see it as a joy, and must think that exchanging a Joseph shirt for a hair one is not only crazy but a little self-righteous, too. </p> <p>But if I was a bit sanctimonious, I was increasingly aware of the pious around me. Perhaps they were always there, but in the same way that the streets seem suddenly paved with pregnant women when you're pregnant, so I'd started hearing of scores of people who'd also given up shopping. Many had done so for financial reasons, others because they'd decided to put their foot down. I found support groups devoted to shoring up the resolve of non-shoppers; an international 'Buy Nothing Day' (this year on 29 November in the UK); even a book, Not Buying It, by the American writer Judith Levine, in which she describes a year without excessive consumption - and paradoxically persuades tens of thousands of people to buy her book. Perhaps some of the roots of the current consumer downturn lie outside the banks and building societies, and in our heads?</p> <p>It's a trend that the psychiatrist and author Oliver James has already identified. 'Many people have reached the point where they feel bloated,' he tells me. 'They've recognised that they've got an addiction to consuming, and they've started to take matters into their own hands.'</p> <p>He places much of the blame for what he has coined 'affluenza' - our craving for the trappings of wealth, and the title of his latest book - at the door of the media: the advertisers, marketers and programme makers who've consistently shown us a glossy, unattainable way of life and made us feel that we're inadequate if we don't match up. 'The media are pretty relentless in getting across the message that money, appearance, possessions and fame are things to value, and the way to stave off depression and loneliness,' he continues. 'If people started to make the connection between spending and how much they had to work, and realised that if they spent less, they'd worry less, then we'd have a significant reduction in mental illness in this country.'</p> <p>Making that inverse connection between time and money was what pushed me through my first serious Not Shopping bottleneck - the early spring days when I couldn't find anything to wear in my (bulging) cupboards, and would, in any other year, have 'invested' in a summer capsule collection (\u00a3275); when the kids were clamouring for electronic games (\u00a365), and the tumble dryer bit the dust (\u00a3299.95). </p> <p>I realised that where before I'd earned in order to spend, now I didn't spend so as to ease the pressure to work every minute I could. A few days with Alfie and Notty had far greater utility than a skirt, some shoes, and a 'summer cashmere' cardigan - even than a pair of wellies that fitted (I'd been wearing Mark's size 11s since failing to mend my leak). And we could live easily without a tumble dryer; so what if it meant turning our house into a giant drying rack when it was too wet to use the line. At the end of the first quarter, my lengthening list of things I hadn't bought totalled \u00a31,278.</p> <p>I poured much of that 'saved' time into my new obsession: a vegetable patch. After three months of inactivity, my credit card was given an outing to the local garden centre, where we spent an afternoon gleefully filling two trolleys with vegetable and herb seeds, a small peach tree, two grape vines, and a Kiwi fruit bush. And when it came to the check-out, I couldn't wait to produce my card and tap my number into the little pad.</p> <p>I can't pretend it didn't feel good to shop again, and to be able to do so with moral justification - proof that, in the past, I hadn't been shopping merely for the joy of what I bought, but for the kick of buying it. How crazy is that? Or maybe it was merely the deep satisfaction of knowing that I'd spent it on something that, with luck and a morsel of sun, is still, six months later, bearing fruit (and veg).</p> <p>And then, sometime during the early, phoney summer, the world changed. What seemed to have been kicked off by some over-enthusiastic lending by a bunch of American building societies, and confined to the housing sector, was rapidly whirling into crisis. The papers - which I read online - were full of reports about food riots: from Burkino Faso to Bangladesh, Haiti to Harare, hundreds of thousands of people were protesting about the rise in food and fuel prices. It was a jolt to my smugness. My small commitment to stop buying frocks and lampshades felt suddenly paltry. I worried that I could be contributing to the impoverishment of producers in the less fortunate parts of the world.</p> <p>Richard Dodd from the British Retail Consortium was unimpressed by my personal Not Shopping commitment. 'This isn't connected to Buy Nothing Day is it?' he asked in a suspicious tone. I assured him it wasn't. 'That's just a nonsense run by the anti-globalisation people. If nobody bought anything, economies around the world would collapse, because buying things drives the economy, it creates and supports jobs. In the UK alone, retail directly employees 3m people, and supports millions more. </p> <p>Shopping,' he assured me, 'is trade, and Trade is a Good Thing.' I could almost hear the capital letters. </p> <p>Dodd continued: 'Thousands of years ago, people began to trade. They learnt that if individuals or groups specialised in activities they did best, then total output was greater. Everybody was better off. Today's consumerism is a modern, more sophisticated version of trade. On average, around the world, we have more things and better lifestyles as a result of economies of scale and trade. It is A Good Thing.'</p> <p>While what he said made sense, I was still not convinced that having more things contributed to the greater good, particularly if the effect of all this consumption is irreversible and potentially catastrophic damage to the planet, something Dodd was unwilling to concede. If we keep accelerating our consumption, will a Chinese textile worker, whose income is derived from our penchant for well-priced Gap cashmere jerseys, have earned enough to buy a small car and shop at Gap herself, improve her lifestyle, and amplify the carbon in the atmosphere? At the same time, will a Kenyan family be homeless and starving after another debilitating drought, caused in part by the damaging effects of the carbon that has been expended in the manufacture, packaging, transportation, purchase and repeated laundering of the same cashmere jersey? I wish I knew for sure that millions, perhaps billions of people won't die because of our need to drive the Top Gear choice, have the latest Nokia MP3 video camera phone, or get fit in front of the Wii. </p> <p>By the half-year mark, the list of things I might have bought came to a whopping \u00a32,367 but, as commodity prices continued to rise, it was increasingly feeling like I was pouring my earnings into necessities: the car, and our bellies. I was lucky that I hadn't blown it before on a cappuccino machine (\u00a3446.99), or a new dress for my book launch (\u00a3250). It was a relief that, for months to come, we would have no need to buy salad or vegetables and, at our current level of production, will not have to buy any tomato spaghetti sauce throughout the winter. </p> <p>Even if I'd wanted to, it didn't look as if I'd be in a financial position to pick up shopping where I left off, once my year was up. I needed to find solutions to the trickiest of my challenges: presents. Barely a week seems to go by without some sort of giving opportunity; birthdays (our children's friends have them the whole time, at around \u00a35-10 a pop), thank yous, weddings and christenings. I wasn't prepared to stop giving presents, but finding something appropriate (and wonderful) for any and every occasion was going to be difficult without resorting to shopping. And there is that horrible sense that you are judged by what you give. </p> <p>I was all right for other kids' parties, for a while anyway, having whipped away a fair proportion of my children's - frankly excessive - Christmas haul and put it in the present drawer before they registered what they'd got. And when we ran out, we gave books (only lightly used) and seed packets. Cards were home-made from the cut-off fronts of ones we'd received, or drawn on paper made from rhino poo. </p> <p>Presents for my own family were another matter. I spent months worrying - and being worried - about what we were going to do for Alfie and Notty's birthdays in July, before coming up with tickets to a KT Tunstall concert in the grounds of a nearby country house for Alf, and a riding picnic party for Notty and three friends. They were happy; I realised again to what extent children live in the day. I carefully siphoned off more of the presents they received from their friends. We're also - theoretically - set for Christmas (a rescue donkey and a tree house, as long as Mark has time to get his saw out to make it). </p> <p>Adults are trickier. My first solution came in the shape of home-made cup-candles. Having convinced myself that charity shop purchases didn't count as shopping, as long as what I bought was somehow useful or necessary, I spent a happy hour trawling the charity shops of Devizes, coming home with a shelf-full of old cups and saucers. I ordered a length of wick online (\u00a31.50 - surely allowed), gathered up our old candle butts and melted them in a double-boiler with some ylang-ylang oil (bought a decade ago, in the Comoros). </p> <p>They looked pretty, if not quite perfect; the wax shrunk from the side of the cups and they didn't smell of much. But I got a buzz out of making them. Instead of the pleasure of supporting the craftsmen, this came from being the craftsman. The reaction I've got from the people I've given them to - and there have been many over the months - has been effusive. Ditto for the jars of homemade tomato chutney and marrow jam. It took me back to my childhood; to presenting my mother with the patchwork cushion I'd made at school, and the painted clay ashtray which she kept on her dressing table even though she'd never smoked. There was just a tiny little nag at the back of my mind, a suspicion that, maybe, people felt a tiny bit sorry for me. </p> <p>I know that in the beginning, when I talked about it incessantly, my decision to stop shopping ferreted out all sorts of feelings from those around me, ranging from admiration through irritation to incredulity. I'm pretty sure that my sister started lying about the new dresses she was buying, passing them off as 'this old thing', though I don't know whether this was out of guilt or to spare my envy. She seemed genuinely delighted at her birthday present of a baby herb garden. One of my best friends, though, who lives in Boston, now makes furtive visits to England without telling me, presumably out of a fear that I'll pull her up on her frequent flying, or disapprove of her new bag.</p> <p>Possibly I would, much as I hate to think so. I don't like this new power I have to induce guilt. But while I don't want to impose my abstinence on anyone else, I can't help feeling like chucking it all in sometimes, buying something wildly useless (with matching shoes), and jetting off to the Caribbean to sleep in an air-conditioned room. But would that really make me feel good for longer than the time it took to calculate my carbon footprint?</p> <p>With the year galloping towards its close, and the recession increasingly evident around us, those shopping urges are fewer and further between. To my surprise, I rarely think about it; in the past few months, there have been few additions to my Did Not Buy list. That's not to say I've been perfect. There have been minor lapses: cricket whites for Alfie, flamenco shoes for Notty, and a small picture for Mark's birthday - of the dead tree in the field outside our bedroom, painted by a friend shortly before it blew down in the storms earlier this year. I even bought my first roll of Sellotape last week. Nothing I regret, though, and nothing for myself. But how long will it continue?</p> <p>I contacted Judith Levine, the American writer who'd spent 2004 'Not Buying It', to ask What Happened Next? She was reassuringly upbeat: 'No, I have not jumped back on the shopping treadmill. Having lived happily for a year without shopping I realise I can live happily without whatever it is I feel like buying. Not buying has had the lasting effect of a sense of security about my future. I know I can save more now and live happily on not much at all.'</p> <p>With three months to go, I'm confident that I'll weather Christmas and get to the end of the year with my Not Shopping pledge pretty much unbroken. And that, after New Year's Eve, I'll wake up a stronger and a wiser person. I've surprised myself; first, by how much I used to think that the stuff I wore and had around me made me who I was, and also, by how liberating it can be not to shop.</p> <p>That's not to say I'm going to stay out of the shops forever; I'll just be more selective about what I buy, about who's made it and where it came from. Come 1 January, I'll be at the front of the queue for a new pair of Wellington boots.</p>",
  "<p>If I may borrow an age-inappropriate idiom, I'd say that Nico Muhly is, like, totally awesome, with a rising inflection at the end of the phrase to match the sound of his voice and the trajectory of his career. In America Muhly is already the most prominent composer of his generation, with Philip Glass and John Adams as his mentors. Earlier this year his concerto for electric violin, in which the soloist maps the transits of stars, had its premiere in London, and in September his ballet Triade was performed at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. His second CD, Mothertongue, was released last spring: it is a sonic wonderland, with settings of Renaissance texts about devils, dolphins and a drunken cathedral organist. He is now completing a score for Stephen Daldry's film The Reader, based on Bernhard Schlink's novel about guilt in post-war Germany. No wonder he feels, as he told me, 'like, totally over-scheduled'.</p> <p>Detractors accuse Muhly of composing music that is merely pretty. He does have an aural sweet tooth, with a weakness for gamelans, marimbas and the stratospheric tinkling of the celesta. But to me, his work is enchanting: as lyrically unearthly as the harmonies that once supposedly filtered down from the tuned spheres in outer space. 'He paints the sky,' his friend Antony Hegarty, lead singer of Antony and the Johnsons, has said. As well as keeping an ear cocked for heavenly messages, Muhly commandeers batteries of electronic noise, sometimes mixes in the domestic babble of a sizzling stove or a hissing shower, and usually underpins his compositions with complex intellectual plots derived from 16th-century astronomy or the creepy byways of folklore. I should add, wincing invisibly, that he has just turned 27, though he looks 16 and has the air of a mischievous cherub, with black tufts sprouting from his scalp like a grove of unkempt palm trees. How can his hair stay under control, since his head is on fire with ideas?</p> <p>'You know, I don't think about music all that much,' he said to me, 'I just write it!' When not composing, he is probably adding to his comical and erudite blog. 'You've read it, right?' he replied when I asked why he bothered with this chatty chronicle. 'It's fun! It's freer than a newspaper column, I can play round with orthography, make up my own style sheet. And I like the fact that it's my space. People can visit, but they're my guests, as if I'd invited them to dinner.' The reference to hospitality was not accidental: in Muhly's kitchen, as in his brain, there are usually several pots simmering. 'I plan my day around food, not art. Eating and cooking, that's totally what matters. Everything else is a confection - or do I mean confectionery?'</p> <p>When we spoke, in his sound-proofed cubby-hole at Philip Glass's studio in New York, Muhly had rushed from Paris, summoned home by Daldry before his ballet had opened. On the eve of his reluctant repatriation, he went for a blow-out in suburban Belleville and gorged on foie gras and veal cheeks. 'Ohmigod!' was his eloquent tribute to the meal; he then grieved over some unopened jars of 'major chestnut pur\u00e9e' he had not been able to bring back with him. The cover of Mothertongue is a photograph of an open mouth. This is where song comes out, and where food goes in. Muhly, who loves language and has an impressive knowledge of English slang, calls his own mouth 'my pie-hole'. 'During the cold months I hunker down and make stock from chicken feet and bits of duck I buy in Chinatown. If I'm working, it suits the rhythm, because I have to get up every hour to stir the pot. Composing is kind of a stewing process. My mother's family is of French descent, so I grew up around cooks. If we phoned up my grandmother now she'd be, like, sitting in her wheelchair boning a capon!'</p> <p>For a haughty modernist like Brecht, the worst thing you could say about art was to call it 'culinary', a trifle cooked up for jaded consumers. Muhly has no qualms about seeing himself as a chef, and happily works to order. In this convivial spirit, he has orchestrated some of Hegarty's backlist for two concerts that Antony and the Johnsons will give with the London Symphony Orchestra at London's Barbican. 'I met Antony through Laurie Anderson. She and Philip Glass were doing a benefit for a Buddhist magazine, and they let us have 10 minutes on the programme. Then we did some arrangements for a fashion show in Arnhem in Holland. Everyone was parading in garbage bags, it was seriously weird! Antony's songs are very simple harmonically, just a playground for the voice. The orchestrations try to make the voice shine and show up his - er - proclivities. I've kind of set him on a throne of brass, with lots of Wagnerian trombones underneath.' It will be an unorthodox enthronement: Hegarty is a gently gigantic cross-dresser and self-proclaimed 'subculturalite', who sings in flutingly androgynous tones about gender reassignment or breast amputation, and begs to receive fistfuls of love.</p> <p>Born in stifling, respectable Chichester, Hegarty fled to New York at 19. Six hours after arriving, he found his way to the Pyramid Club, headquarters of the gay punk avant-garde in the blitzed East Village; there he located his tribe. Muhly's equally restless imagination has led him east, not west. Growing up in New England, the only child of two counter-cultural and unparental artists, the adolescent Nico attached himself to a dreamy old England that he discovered by listening to High Anglican church music. 'I know, it's culturally bizarre. But for me William Byrd's music is the most fascinating thing ever, maybe just because it's so severe and restrained. He could only write one note for every syllable of text, otherwise they called him a papist. Then there was Tallis writing this totally decadent, continental-sounding stuff at the same time, and Orlando Gibbons with those twisted cadences that they thought announced some devilly apparition. Because of all this I became a choirboy, then I got obsessed with finding out about the English Reformation. It was, like, wow, so there was this gay king, James I, who wrote the Bible!'</p> <p>Muhly's exploration of the liturgy gave him a love of language that matches his connoisseurship of music's non-verbal sounds. He may not have outgrown teen jargon - talking to me, he dismissed Prokofiev's opera War and Peace as 'totally bad shit' - but he treasures quaint or quirky words, especially if they look like abstract musical notation. His Paris blog includes a snapshot of a poster for 'l'iPhone', with a caption that analyses the exotic sandwich of consonants and comma. The same posting describes a stroll in the Parc de Sceaux, irresistible to Muhly because of 'the high ratio of silent letters to pronounced letters' in its name; it supplies the punning title for this instalment of his electronic diary, headed 'Sceaux what?' </p> <p>Muhly retains a childish sense of wonder, evident in the marvels he investigates in Mothertongue, and the strange is, for him, closely allied to the sacred. As his blog says about the Parc de Sceaux, 'There's gotta be something awesome there!'</p> <p>The young Nico's piety was his way of teasing his parents, who belonged to a generation that venerated Maharishis and imbibed enlightenment from drugs. He initially resisted the faith that the music of Byrd and Tallis upheld, and refused to give God a capital letter when transcribing hymns for his choir. Eventually he tiptoed into the fold. Today his professional life is funkily downtown but he goes uptown to worship at an Episcopal church on Fifth Avenue. He dodges questions of belief because his religion is inseparable from his juvenile infatuation with England. In 1994 his mother spent a year at the American Academy in Rome. He agitated to be sent to an English boarding school for the duration; to his fury, she ignored his pleas. He craved the monogrammed blazers and the surplices, and was even prepared for the pederastic choirmasters. 'You know that bit from Evensong about preparing yourself for the dangers of the night? Whenever I hear that, I think of these little choirboys filing out into some foggy quadrangle and probably getting touched up by an old don on his way to eat dinner in the senior common room.' I wondered why Muhly was so fixated on the stuffiest, nastiest aspects of England. 'Hey, I like the good things too!' Asked to be more specific, he thought for a while and then, with his usual quizzical inflection, said 'Oh, I dunno, maybe Coronation Chicken?'</p> <p>Childhood, with its fears and longings, is a life-long resource for most artists. Muhly's childhood, even without being packed off to a brutish public school, was satisfyingly Gothic, haunted by imaginary terrors that he is still translating into music. 'We lived in the woods in Vermont. There was this sharply banked pond, too steep to be mowed, so my father used to go to an unlit garage and get this big old scarey-arsed scythe to chop down the grass: my dad was the grim reaper! A sex murderer killed a little girl and buried her nearby, where my mother collects wild leeks. She pointed out the spot when I was up there in the summer. How witchy is that? I was thinking, \"Mom, if you scrape the skin off leeks that grew on that little girl's grave and brew up a tisane for me to drink, it's, like, over between us, it's a total wrap!\"'</p> <p>Despite his giggling dread, Muhly has turned to this world of despoiled innocence for his first opera. The commission comes from the Metropolitan Opera in New York, though the premiere may be given by English National Opera; the subject is a crime that actually happened in Manchester during the Nineties, when a 14-year-old boy erotically ensnared a 16-year-old boy online, lured him to a rendezvous and then, like Madame Butterfly in short pants, sacrificially arranged his own death as a gesture of vengeful, unrequited love. The story would have had a sickly fascination for Benjamin Britten, so perversely obsessed with the purity of childhood. When Muhly first heard the scene when the abused boy in Britten's Peter Grimes reveals his bruises, he felt he had come across 'a long-lost twin brother'; perhaps Britten is the wicked uncle Muhly has adopted. </p> <p>'I know,' Muhly said about his own work in progress, 'it's very Britten, like Turn of the Screw updated. If Miles and Flora had the internet, they'd be up to some real shit! He'd be taking nudie photos of her in some manor house and uploading them, and poor old Peter Quint, who gets blamed for everything, would be the innocent one. Can't you totally imagine it?' Muhly whooped with evil delight. For the main role in his opera, he will have to find a depraved chorister. 'Easy,' he grinned, brandishing his mobile phone, 'I've got eight numbers in here!'</p> <p>A week later I sat across the aisle from Muhly at a gala to open the Metropolitan Opera season. He had tuxedoed himself for the trip uptown and smoothed his rebellious hair, though he sported violently striped red socks. On stage, the soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming lusciously swanned and swooned through excerpts from operas by Verdi, Massenet and Strauss. As Muhly applauded, I remembered what he had said to me about romantic composers like these: 'They're like relatives I haven't met yet.' He seems ready to join that extended family, and may soon be inviting his august predecessors to dinner.</p> <p>Toumani Diabat\u00e9 plays Nico Muhly's arrangements with the RLPO at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on Tuesday and with the LSO at the Barbican on 29 October.

After starting to learn piano at eight, Muhly joined a school choir and his passion for music was cemented. While studying English and music composition at Columbia university, Muhly began working for Philip Glass as editor, keyboardist, and conductor.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Will Lewis Hamilton become the formula one world champion today?</strong> It's the only question that matters and the young Briton has put himself in exactly the right position to do it by qualifying on pole position for the Chinese grand prix. It is 50 years to the day since Mike Hawthorn claimed Britain's first ever drivers' title - for Ferrari - and if Hamilton can do it today he'll become the ninth Brit to see his name etched on that trophy.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>So, what does Hamilton need to do to avenge last year's disappointment and win that title?</strong> Here are some scenarios if all three title contenders finish the race. If the following happens, Hamilton does it...<br>1 Hamilton wins and Felipe Massa finishes the race no higher than fifth<br>2 Hamilton finishes second, Massa finishes no higher than seventh position and Robert Kubica does not win<br>3 Hamilton finishes third, Massa finishes out of the points, and Kubica does not win or finish second</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Of course,</strong> I could spent hours doodling and plotting different situations - a meteor wipes out the McLaren prat perch; a giant duck plucks Massa from his cockpit - but there's less than 30 minutes to go until the start of the race, so let's not bother. Instead, we'll re-cap that starting grid:</p> <p>1. Lewis Hamilton, Britain, McLaren<br>2. Kimi Raikkonen, Finland, Ferrari<br>3. Felipe Massa, Brazil, Ferrari<br>4. Fernando Alonso, Spain, Renault<br>5. Heikki Kovalainen, Finland, McLaren<br>6. Sebastian Vettel, Germany, Toro Rosso<br>7. Jarno Trulli, Italy, Toyota<br>8. Sebastien Bourdais, France, Toro Rosso<br>9. Nick Heidfeld, Germany, BMW<br>10. Nelson Piquet Jnr., Brazil, Renault<br>11. Robert Kubica, Poland, BMW<br>12. Timo Glock, Germany, Toyota<br>13. Rubens Barrichello, Brazil, Honda<br>14. Nico Rosberg, Germany, Williams<br>15. David Coulthard, Britain, Red Bull<br>16. Mark Webber, Australia, Red Bull<br>14. Kazuki Nakajima, Japan, Williams<br>18. Jenson Button, Britain, Honda<br>19. Adrian Sutil, Germany, Force India<br>20. Giancarlo Fisichella, Italy, Force India</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Mystic mog:</strong> what are your predictions for the race Gem, I can hear you cry from under your duvets. Well, to say the start isn't going to be easy for Hamilton is to understate the mental challenge of getting over last weekend's Fuji fluff-up, to ignore the bright-red danger to his side and immediately behind and to banish from memory last year's Shanghai surprise, when the Briton's world title chances creepy-crawled into the gravel here. Running mate Kovalainen should be up there in a supporting role, but he's on the third row having qualified behind Alonso - the man who has said he will help Massa to win the title. Sheesh! I think Hamilton will make a mint start, repel Ferrari's challenge and drive to a cool victory... but I think Massa will finish in second place and take the showdown to Sao Paulo. We've seen a catalogue of mistakes from both the big title challengers this season, but I think this race is too critical to mess up. The again, we probably thought that last year...</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>For the record,</strong> Hamilton has said he will use last weekend's erroneous start as an experience not to repeat and that he's driving for points, not the title, today. Here he strides, out to the grid, a quick thumbs up for the camera. What a cool cucumber.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>I've not mentioned Robert Kubica, have I? </strong>Well, given that he's back down in 12th on the grid, he's a little difficult to spot. Understeer and poor balance wrecked his qualifying and he's said that it's unlikely he'll win the title now. Personally, I think it should go to Hamilton or Massa anyway - they've been the boys to watch - but while there's a mathematical possibility you never know.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Good morning Gary Naylor, </strong>thanks for your email and a blindingly obvious scenario that I overlooked: 'Lewis and Massa finish together in a Parisian courtroom and nobody wins?'</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The weather looks fine</strong> at the moment, warm and dry, but rain is predicted in the closing stages. No sleet forecast, though.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Did I just hear a muffled cackle escaping from Alonso's helmet? </strong> I wonder how he's going to help Massa to win the title? Hop into the Ferrari? Lend him his lucky kecks? Get in front of Hamilton and hit the 'tacks' and 'oil slick' buttons?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The cars are heading around to prepare for the start, </strong>Hamilton is on the harder tyre but both Ferraris are on the soft option. BMW have just told Kubica over the intercom that there could be rain fairly soon...</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Hamilton's engineer tells him</strong> 'brakes are good, brakes are good'. Phew! That'll make things a bit easier. Official weather forecast: 40 per cent chance of rain.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Start:</strong> Here we go... Hamilton makes a good start and retains the lead. Clean into the first corner this weekend... Top three same as at the start but Kovalainen battling Alonso.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Lap one: </strong> Hamilton leads from Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso and Kovalainen. The Finnish McLaren driver had got past the Renault but Alonso reclaimed the position. Behind them it's Heidfeld, Vettel and Kubica - the Pole up to eighth after a strong first lap.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Lap two: </strong>Trulli has pitted for a new nose after a clash at the first corner on the first lap. He must have collided with Bourdais - who has dropped to 18th position.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Lap three:</strong> Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is 2.5seconds and Massa is 4.1seconds off the man he is fighting for the title with.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Lap four:</strong> Trulli pits again, this time to retire, our first non-finisher of the race. Webber is fighting Barrichello for P10. Hamilton just shy of 5seconds ahead of third-placed Massa - the McLaren is flying.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Lap five: </strong>Here's the order - Hamilton, Raikkonen, Massa, Alonso, Kovalainen, Heidfeld, Vettel, Kubica, Piquet, Barrichello, Webber, Glock, Rosberg, Coulthard, Button, Nakajima, Bourdais, Sutil, Fisichella</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Lap six: </strong> Ferrari must be concerned about Hamilton's superior pace. He's steadily pulling away at the head of the field - now 3.5seconds over Raikkonen and 6.1seconds over Massa. The Brazilian's pace in particular should be worrying the boys in red. Hamilton has just done a 1min36 (the new fastest lap) and Massa's almost a second slower.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Lap seven: </strong>Webber has taken tenth from Barrichello at the final corner.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Lap eight:</strong> Hamilton still the only man to set a 1m36 and there's not much else to report other than his stonking pace.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Graham Wayne</strong> has sent me a riddle. At least, I don't have a clue what he's on about. But that could be because I should by rights be tucked up in bed. He says: 'Hamilton gets away properly without taking to the countryside. And this despite the little seen interference to his car on the grid when some very confused US Republicans were caught smearing lipstick on his tyres...'</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Lap ten: </strong>Webber has passed Piquet for ninth at the final corner. Piquet's engineers kindly tell him not to worry, as the man from Down Under is running light. Aw, that's nice of them. So much for Briatore's tough love.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Charlie Whiting </strong>has stuck his hand outside the window and now says there's just a 20 per cent chance of rain.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Lap 11: </strong>Raikkonen has set the fastest lap with 1m36.612s and Massa has also dipped below the 1m37 mark as the Ferrari's get up to Hamilton's pace.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Lap 13:</strong> Webber pits - as insinuated by the Renault engineers. Hamilton had a slide running through turn two but still sets a time four tenths up on Raikkonen. Rosberg has passed Glock.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Lap 14:</strong> The Ferrari mechanics are in the pit lane... but McLaren's boys in bacofoil haven't jumped up. Massa pits!</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Lap 15: </strong>Alonso also pitted at the same time. Massa rejoins in eighth behind Kubica and Alonso comes in behind Piquet in tenth. Now the McLaren engineers come out.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Lap 16: </strong>Raikkonen pits at same time as Hamilton. The McLaren gets out first - keeping to harder tyres - and they rejoin separated by Vettel, which is more good news for Hamilton. Sutil has retired.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Lap 17:</strong> Massa has kept on the softer tyres. Hamilton is 5.6seconds ahead of Raikkonen. And Kovalainen - yet to pit - leads from Heidfeld.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Lap 18:</strong> Heidfeld has now pitted. A bit further down the grid, Barrichello is holding his own in tenth. It might not be in the points, but it marks a good afternoon for the Brazilian Honda driver.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Lap 19:</strong> Kovalainen now pits, as does Vettel, with both staying on the harder tyre. Hamilton leads again. This is looking good for the Brit.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Lap 20:</strong> Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is now 6.9seconds. Kubica - who has yet to pit - is in third ahead of Massa. The Brazilian's deficit to Hamilton is 14.1seconds...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Graham Wayne </strong> - who I hope isn't the only person reading this LbL - says: 'stand by for rain \u2013 it's my real worry now, that everything will go weird in the wet \u2013 but Hamilton is looking like a champ to me...' I wish he was, Graham, but if Massa finishes in third then he won't be champ in this race. Graham also adds that his humour is still warming up. Anyone else know any good jokes?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Lap 23:</strong> There really isn't much to report at the moment... Raikkonen's pace is pretty much matching Hamilton's. Piquet pits.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Hello Kate Connolly!</strong> Nice to hear from you again. \"I can't believe that James Allen just wasted valuable commentary time telling us about Lewis Hamilton's little brother taking his GCSEs,\" you grumble. Me neither. I mean, I know there isn't too much excitement at the moment, but really. \"Who's your favourite driver? Not necessarily who's the best driver, but who do you find yourself rooting for? You know how I love Kubica, and I'm also rather partial to poor old Bourdais myself, which means I spend a lot of time being dismayed, and outraged after last race. He was robbed!\" I certainly agree that Bourdais was robbed - although my post-race blog picking on the stewards raised a bit of ire. Personally, I'm rooting for Hamilton. He's been the most exciting driver to watch the season and has the most commitment in races. He may have made mistakes, but he hasn't put in dismal performances like Massa in Silverstone.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Lap 27: </strong>Kubica has not pitted and Raikkonen has now made up time on Hamilton. The Ferrari driver has reduced the gap to 6.4seconds. Massa is 15.4seconds behind Hamilton.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Graham Crawford emails:</strong> 'Will Alonso now make no attempt to get past Massa, to further his grudge against Hamilton? That would be rather disgraceful, wouldn't it? (Being paid millions to race and not racing.)' <em>Sooo</em> true Graham. Alonso is 6.4seconds behind Massa but I can't see him putting his foot down. Half the race is now run - not exactly a thriller, is it?</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>David Goodrum</strong> is stuck at work and following the LbL but has no jokes. Who are you rooting for David? Do you want Hamilton to sock it to Massa?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Lap 29: </strong>Coulthard and Fisichella have pitted. Two of the oldest and two of the slowest in this race... cruel but accurate.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Marcus Gearey </strong>(fab racing name <em>Gear</em>ey) asks how many coffees I've downed this morning. None is the answer, as there were no shops open on my way into the office at 6.30sm sadly. \"I've had 2 pit stops,\" says Marcus. \"I took on a double espresso at 7AM but had to take on an extra single 15 minutes ago. If it carries on at this stultifyingly dull level of excitement I may need another splash and dash though I figured perhaps with a cheeky dash of chocolate sprinkles for a level of excitement sufficient to drag me to the kitchen in the first place. Can I promote my \"hilarious\" F1 comedy website pitflaps.com? I had 14 hits last month which I believe may be some sort of internet-indifference record though I'd be grateful if anybody could confirm as I could do with the publicity...any publicity.\" Let's all check it out...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Lap 32:</strong> Webber and Nakajima have both pitted. Raikkonen has flicked the bird to Fisichella when he lost a second getting past the Force India. The order is still the same at the front and Hamilton's lead over Raikkonen is 8seconds.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Bear with me... this is great.</strong> Brian Garvey says: \"Lewis Hamilton and Philippa Masa walk into a bar. Lewis asks for a pint and Massa asks for... a... hm... hm... ?... hm... - a shandy. Barman asks: why the big paws? Because Massa was dressed a bear!</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Lap 35:</strong> A right front puncture for Heikki Kovalainen! This isn't good for McLaren's constructors' title hopes. He's crawling round trying to get to the pits...</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Good morning Simon Woods!</strong> 'The TV keeps telling me that Hamilton will want to turn the revs down a bit... but doesn't he still have his joker engine change to use?' Yes, I believe he does. But perhaps you're only allowed to use it if you can prove your current unit is bust? Sorry, I don't have a definitive answer on this one.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Lap 37: </strong>Alonso has pitted and the Ferrari mechanics are preparing for a driver... it's Massa. Martin Whitmarsh is shown timing the rival's stop.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Ben emails from Sao Paulo:</strong> 'Spare a thought for me - not only did I have to wake up for a 5am start, but I'm a lone Brit amongst friends and family all rooting for Massa. While Hamilton seems to be handling the pressure ok so far, I wonder how he'd fare if he knew that his eventual victory would mean unashamed mockery on my part of every Brazilian I meet (which is everyone everyday)?'</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Lap 39: </strong>Hamilton and Raikkonen both pit and change to soft tyres. Again no dramas.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Dave Goodrum emails: </strong>'Would love to see Hamilton win it, but would like to see Massa finish high enough for the racing to continue. I always think that the edge goes off if the championship is decided too early. Plus I enjoy the bitching that's been going on between the drivers, I think its great!' Dave you wag, enjoying all the tit-for-tat. I'm getting a bit fed up of it personally and, although I understand your reasons, I fear that if the title goes down to the finale it'll be Massa who wins it, not Hamilton. Which wouldn't be good for Ben from Sao Paulo...</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Lap 40:</strong> Just two seconds between Raikkonen and Massa... how obvious will he make it when he lets Massa past? Not very.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Lap 42:</strong> Vettel has pitted from sixth position, but it's a bit of a tardy stop. The German is quietly having another good race. Kovalainen has passed Rosberg... for 15th... as he fights his way back from the puncture.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Tim in Spain</strong> has just sent an interesting email: 'Morning all, presumably Alonso imagines he is already on Ferrari's payroll? According to the totally biased press over here Ferrari are desperate to get rid of Raikkonen, who is all washed up in their opinion, and replace him with the perpetually whining (my opinion) Alonso. Having said that I am rooting for Massa, so carry on doing nothing Fernando.'</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Martin Warren asks:</strong> 'Why the change to soft tyres when the others seemed to be doing the trick - thanks?' The drivers have to use both specifications of tyres during the race - those are the rules. Massa appeared to be happier with the balance on the softs earlier but now they have no choice but to run him on the harder tyres.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Lap 46: </strong>Button has made the second and final stop in a dismal race. Not that it's his fault...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Katie has emailed to say:</strong> 'I don't think you're allowed to use your 'joker' at the last race.' And she's completely right... here's the rule:<br><em><br>From 2008, a driver will not be penalised the first time he needs a replacement engine during the season, unless it is at the final event of the championship.</em><br>So Hamilton might ease off somewhat, with his 15second lead and less than 10 laps to go.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Lap 49:</strong> Massa has eased past Raikkonen. It's a team game, so you can't really criticise them. Hamilton only looks set to extend his lead by two points... unless there's rain or an earthquake or a stampede of termites in the next few laps.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Lap 50: </strong>Our order, then, is: Hamilton, Massa, Raikkonen, Alonso, Heidfeld, Kubica, Glock, Piquet, Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello, Nakajima, Bourdais, Webber, Rosberg, Button, Fisichella. Kovalainen has retired through brake issues.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>A handful of laps left</strong> then and it looks certain that the drivers' title will go down to wire in Brazil in a fortnight. What's the betting that Hamilton's car will appear on the Interlagos grid covered in bubble wrap to protect it from hits from Alonso and Raikkonen? And the Toro Rossos? The McLaren will only need to finish fifth to win the title there if this race finishes with its current order...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Lap 54:</strong> Hamilton's advantage over Massa is just under 16seconds. It doesn't look like he's turning down the wick much.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Last lap:</strong> Wake up everybody, it's over! A dull race but a safe one for Hamilton, who takes the flag. He's done the best he could and now the title will be decided in Brazil in a fortnight. Thanks to Raikkonen, Massa crosses the line in second position.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p>Here is how they crossed the line:<br>1 Lewis Hamilton<br>2 Felipe Massa<br>3 Kimi Raikkonen<br>4 Fernando Alonso<br>5 Nick Heidfeld<br>6 Robert Kubica<br>7 Timo Glock<br>8 Nelson Piquet<br>9 Sebastian Vettel<br>10 David Coulthard<br>11 Rubens Barrichello<br>12 Kazuki Nakajima<br>13 Sebastian Bourdais<br>14 Mark Webber<br>15 Nico Rosberg<br>16 Jenson Button<br>17 Giancarlo Fisichella</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>What it means: </strong>Hamilton has proved that he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this world title fight. With a seven point advantage, he has to finish no higher than fifth in Interlagos - even if Massa wins - to claim the title. McLaren must have both cars finish if they want to keep in the hunt for the constructors' title, as Ferrari's advantage is now 11 points after Kovalainen failed to finish. We're set for a fantastic showdown in Brazil in two weeks so join us then.</p>",
  "<p>MG Sports and Racing Europe are the last small, British-owned part of what was once the British Motor Corporation. Based in Worcestershire, they employ eight people and are a vital part of the local economy. One of their proudest moments came when they bought the badge rights to the MG X-Power brand, keeping a bit of MG Motors alive in the Midlands. But like many small and medium-sized businesses, they are feeling the pinch of the credit crunch.</p> <p>So last Monday managing director William Riley went to see his bank for help. But it wasn't just any bank: it was RBS, which that very day had effectively been taken into public ownership, with taxpayers taking a majority shareholding. And what did he get? Not a penny. Indeed, to add insult to injury, they even reduced his overdraft limit.</p> <p>Though we are doing everything to save our financial system and the banks on which we all rely, this painful story shows that we ignore what's happening in our real economy at our peril. The real economy is the 300,000 families who cannot meet their mortgage repayments and fear for their homes. It's the 164,000 people who've become unemployed - the largest rise in 17 years - in the last three months. And it's the people like William Riley, whose lifetime of hard work is under real threat.</p> <p>After a decade of Labour's economic incompetence, we enter this downturn more vulnerable than almost any other developed country. We cannot, like Canada and America, give families and businesses a helping hand with extra money. Why not? Because Labour thought boom would never turn to bust, and put nothing aside, leaving the cupboard bare.</p> <p>In the coming months, the Conservative party will be outlining our plans to help families, homeowners and entrepreneurs. That work starts this weekend with our plan for small businesses.</p> <p>Britain's small businesses need our help. We intervened to prevent the beating heart of our economy - the financial system - from collapsing. We've got to do the same for its lifeblood. Small and medium-sized businesses employ over 13 million people and turn over \u00a31,440bn a year.</p> <p>After a decade of irresponsible capitalism and irresponsible government, repairing our broken economy isn't the responsibility of any one person or organisation - it's a responsibility we all share. And three areas stand out.</p> <p>First, councils have an important responsibility. Lots of our small businesses provide goods and services to local authorities, with payment normally coming within 30 days. But Brentwood and Castlepoint councils have led the way in reducing this to just 20 days. These 10 days can make all the difference in paying bills and staff, and helping businesses survive, and I want more local authorities to take it up.</p> <p>Second, banks have got to behave more responsibly too. They've got to understand that now taxpayers are keeping them afloat it's their duty to unblock the credit channels, treat small businesses fairly and stop the march to mass insolvencies.</p> <p>Third, and most important, government can do most to help our small businesses. Bureaucracy in the Treasury means that many businesses are still waiting for tax rebates. And this government is still pressing ahead with plans to raise its small business corporation tax by 2p.</p> <p>It's also about being proactive. A few months ago the Conservatives announced plans to reform insolvency law to give sound businesses the breathing space they need to restructure their finances and stop going to the wall. And today we are calling on the government to allow small and medium-sized enterprises to defer their VAT bills for up to six months. That means a typical small business with 50 employees, revenues of \u00a35m and an annual net VAT bill of \u00a3350,000, doesn't have to find \u00a390,000 to pay the taxman when the bank has just taken away its overdraft.</p> <p>Gordon Brown cannot hide from the truth. In the short term, we've got to help families up and down the country with proposals to get them through the downturn. In the long term, we've got to repair our economy by getting the public finances back in order.</p> <p>\u2022 David Cameron is the leader of the Conservative party.</p>",
  "<p>The death of Daniel James, the 23-year-old rugby player who visited a Swiss euthanasia clinic last month, is the most appalling burden his parents will ever have to bear, whether or not they are prosecuted, and whether or not they are sent to prison for what they did on his behalf.</p> <p>They decided to believe him when he said that after he was paralysed in a scrum his life was of no value to him, and that he would prefer death. It was not a sudden decision but one taken over many months, during which he had shown, by attempting suicide, that he was in deadly earnest. They made a deliberate moral choice, and carried it out in what must have been an agonising journey to Switzerland. Their courage has been enormous; but it would be hard to deny that they acted unlawfully.</p> <p>Not everyone faced with the life that Daniel James foresaw for himself would react in the same way. There are many stories of young people suffering similar injuries who have decided that their lives are still worth living, however limited their physical powers. But there are others who cannot stand the thought of forever being completely dependent on others, however loving. In their eyes, life in itself is not valuable, only the freedom and enjoyment that life gives. Daniel James had time to decide that without such freedom death would be better. It was this decision that his parents respected, allowing him his final freedom to choose.</p> <p>This case, coming so soon after the test case brought by Debbie Purdy, is bound itself to become a test case. </p> <p>If Mr and Mrs James are not prosecuted, though the evidence against them is crystal clear, it will seem that, though assisting someone to die is a crime if the death occurs in this country, it is permissible if the death occurs in a country whose laws permit it. There are three ways to interpret this.</p> <p>First, it may suggest that assisting someone to die is not intrinsically wrong, but only contrary to the law, like driving on the right in the UK. Alternatively, it may suggest that we have moral scruples about assisted dying but are prepared to turn a blind eye if it is not in our back yard. Or, we may seem to be saying: 'We have failed to find a way to legislate to permit assisted dying that is not subject to abuse. If other countries have succeeded, let us take advantage of their laws.'</p> <p>If the prosecution proceeds but the accused are not convicted, or are bound over, then the question will be whether the law will ever be fully implemented. And as it becomes plain that it will not, so it will be increasingly disregarded, though family members or doctors will remain in a state of uncertainty when they disregard it. This was the position in the Netherlands between 1973 and 2002, when doctors openly provided assistance to die in cases of acute suffering and generally escaped prosecution on a plea of 'necessity', where the duty to relieve suffering outweighed the usual duty to preserve life. In 2002, the law was changed so that assisting death in certain specified circumstances was no longer a crime, and the uncertainty was brought to an end. But before the change in the law, public opinion would have made it hard to secure a conviction in court. A jury is unwilling to convict where the prisoner seems to face an unjust penalty.</p> <p>The case of Mr and Mrs James, like that of Debbie Purdy, thus presents a legal dilemma. Whether or not they are prosecuted, the law will be challenged. There are many, of whom I am one, who believe that we must try yet again to change the law, not by excluding from criminality those who assist death by taking the suicide abroad but by liberalising the laws of our own country. One argument is that it would be unjust if only the relatively wealthy could lawfully be assisted to die. But the more crucial argument is this: we have a moral obligation to take other people's seriously reached decisions with regard to their own lives equally seriously, not putting our judgment of the value of their life above theirs. Mr and Mrs James have sadly and dramatically carried out this moral obligation.</p>",
  "<p>Thirty years ago when I was irresponsible, full of beans and working for an evening newspaper there used to be a technique to divert the attention of the libel lawyer. The trick was to write a wholly outrageous allegation into the first few paragraphs of a story, then place the fact that you wanted to publish lower down. The libel lawyer would skid to a halt beside your desk clutching several sheets of copy - newspaper articles were then typed with three pieces of carbon paper and presented with one paragraph per page - and gibber that you could not call someone a glue-sniffing pederast in print. A tussle would ensue but after several minutes you would surrender the allegation. I lost count of the times my treasured fact got into print.</p> <p>The government's tactics on the counter terrorism bill remind me of this - at least in effect. We know how much Jacqui Smith wanted 42-day detention without charge from her graceless capitulation in the Commons, but look at what remains in the bill and you will see that she's far from defeated. You may go further and reach the conclusion that in their claim to defend our free society the government, Home Secretary and the Home Office have become its greatest threat.</p> <p>Still intact are the measures for post-charge questioning, which may add to the presumption of guilt; the confiscation of property without trial; extra punishment without trial beyond the original sentence; a new offence for volunteer workers of not giving police information; and a new offence of providing information about the armed forces. </p> <p>This last measure was raised in a letter from Lord Rea, Sir Geoffrey Bindman and others to the Guardian in June: 'We fear this will become yet another convenient tool for use against the peace movement,' they said. Others believe that the bill's measures will, 'provide for the possibility of travel bans and long-term daily reporting or surveillance arrangements for anyone convicted of an offence under anti-terrorism legislation, without any regard for the seriousness of the offence'.</p> <p>In other words we have still got one hell of a fight to preserve British liberty, and while there are many other serious calls on our attention these days we should pay attention to Ms Smith who towers over our democracy like some comic-strip super-villain dominatrix. She is wrong, corrosive and arrogant.</p> <p>As Moli\u00e8re said: 'A woman always has her revenge ready.' Having been defeated by what for most was a heart-warming majority in the Lords she announced a draft bill for extended detention without trial that she said she would keep until a time of crisis when she could push it through Parliament without opposition. What does that say for her respect for the calm deliberations that defeated 42 days last week or the government's opportunistic use of the menace of terrorism?</p> <p>The Home Secretary is remorseless. Last Wednesday she announced a typical New Labour consultation on the government's Interception Modernisation Programme that will gather and store the information from all emails, internet connections and phone calls. 'I want this (consultation),' she said, 'to be combined with well-informed debate, characterised by openness, rather than mere opinion, by reason and reasonableness.' I wonder how 'openness' trumps 'mere opinion' in her mind. At any rate it is clear 'reasonableness' in this context means going along with the government and giving up our freedoms, as we have been doing for 10 years now.</p> <p>Let us just be clear that this new proposal represents a very great threat to individual privacy and in practice it is no different from the original idea of collecting the content of all emails and phone calls. 'The government is proposing to record - for life - the details of everyone you call or write to and what websites you visit,' said Phil Booth of NO2ID. Keith Vaz, chair of the Home Affairs select committee, Lord Carlisle, the government's independent reviewer of terror laws and the left-wing backbencher John McDonnell - none of them in the front rank of civil libertarians - all expressed grave alarm at this idea.</p> <p>So did the Times and Daily Mail. So did the audience of BBC's Question Time: when Geoff Hoon, the new Secretary of State for Transport said he would go a long way to undermine civil liberties to stop people being killed by terrorists, the mockery of the audience, to say nothing of the guilt and irritation on Hoon's face, was palpable.</p> <p>Two years ago I wondered in these pages when the penny would drop with the British public and the media about the attack on civil liberties. It is plainly beginning to. The public is worried about the shoddy laws the government tries to rush past them with its phony calls for consensus and reasonableness.</p> <p>A small incident in Liverpool last week seemed to indicate something was happening. When police tried to break up a demonstration in support of the Freedom Not Fear organisation, it was passers-by who shouted, 'free speech' and 'you're a disgrace' as the police made arrests.</p> <p>The change of attitudes has come about partly because of the government's appalling record on data security. Not a week goes by, it seems, without a security lapse. Last week the Armed Forces minister Bob Ainsworth was forced to admit that the Ministry of Defence has lost a hard drive which may contain the details of 1.7 million people. This follows the news that the Home Office has lost a mere 43 laptops and 93 cell phones in three years, that a memory stick containing records of 84,000 prisoners has gone missing and that the personal details of 18,000 NHS staff vanished in the post. When the government asks the public to trust it with their data the response is: 'Why the bloody hell should we?'</p> <p>We have got a long way to go and that is due to the authoritarian habits that have become so deeply ingrained in government departments, principally in the Home Office. The worry must be that whatever the government, the Home Office rolls on with its own agenda, a state within a state bent on increasing the power of centralised authority.</p>",
  "<p>For their fans, it is one of the great attractions of Madonna's children's books that each one comes with its own, distinct moral. Unlike Aesop, she refuses to allow the demands of narrative to compromise simplicity of instruction. As the author said herself, after the publication of her first story, in 2003: 'I'm not interested in being recognised as a writer. I'm interested in getting the message out there. The book deals with jealousy, envy and being covetous of what other people have and what a waste of time that is.'</p> <p>Above all, in The English Roses Madonna commands young readers not to judge people by appearances. Just because a person might seem to be, say, meretricious, materialistic, foul-mouthed and youth-obsessed, with disturbing musculature and a habit of waggling her venerable crotch in front of hundreds of thousands of complete strangers, doesn't mean she might not, in reality, inhabit a rarified spiritual plane from which - to the great good fortune to those around her - she occasionally returns with important messages about the sacred side of life.</p> <p>Subsequent titles by Madonna Ritchie (as the author of Sex is described on the book jackets), urge kiddies to shun 'the green-eyed monster', warn them not to spread malicious gossip, and, in the cautionary tale of Lotsa de Casha, enlighten the youngsters on the supreme irrelevance of unimaginable wealth. 'Lotsa was by far the richest man in the country. He had everything that money could buy,' the book begins. 'But there was a teeny, tiny problem. No matter how much money Lotsa de Casha made, he wasn't happy.'</p> <p>Appropriately, all profits from the sale of Lotsa de Casha and its companion volumes go to a project called Spirituality for Kids, an offshoot of the Kabbalah Centre offering young students the chance to experience for themselves the Kabbalistic wisdom which has long sustained both Madonna and her husband, Guy Ritchie. They will learn, for instance, that, 'all people have an essence within that is inherently good'.</p> <p>But there's a teeny, tiny problem. If all people have an essence within that is inherently good, how come Madonna just called her soon to be ex-husband an emotional retard? In public? Just before she sang 'Miles Away' at Boston's TD Banknorth Garden stadium? Of course, we've all seen Guy, in his tweed cap. And we've seen the The Vicar of Dibley. We understand that the best religious folk can have trouble with their personal relationships. No reasonable person would expect Madonna to have super-human success in keeping her marriage together, just because she's spent at least a decade learning everything Kabbalah has to teach about relationships. There is a taste of her knowledge on the Kabbalah Centre website. 'Becoming the right person - not finding the right person - is the real key to loving relationships.'</p> <p>So could Madonna have solved everything by drinking more pints of beer? Could fellow Kabbalist, Guy, on the other hand, have spent a few more hours having oxygen blasted upliftingly on his face? Or did the decline of their marriage coincide with the latter's alleged apostasy? Dismiss them if you like, but these questions must weigh heavily with Kabbalists. Given that Madonna's name is not merely synonymous with their faith, but represents to millions of potential converts its active manifestation on Earth, the very reputation of this belief system, cult - whatever - surely rests on the outcome of this holiest of divorces. Meanwhile, Puffin books might reflect whether 'emotional retard' is helpful language from an author it introduces to young readers as a trusted moral guide, mediating between their own world and that of the Kabbalistic sages.</p> <p>Emotional retards, on the other hand, must be thrilled with Madonna's offer of an Englishman in the less than dashing guise of Ritchie proving that appearances can be deceptive. Faux-geezerish, mildly homophobic, upper-middle-class products of minor public schools may, after all, have much to teach adults about standing on their own two feet. One of Ritchie's first reported comments, after news broke of the Madonna rupture, to the effect that he wanted 'not one penny' of her fortune, suggested that there might, after all, be advantages to deer-killing Neanderthals who call their wives the 'missus'. The dandy described by Madonna's brother, in his dreadfully compelling Life with My Sister Madonna, as insisting on red velvet-lined and illuminated display cases for his cuff links and watches, suddenly promises to be a man of Kiplingesque stature.</p> <p>Admittedly, Ritchie's refusal to see his marriage as a pension plan is not a very modern, very English, or even patriotic point of view. Not when London is celebrated as the world's top divorce venue; where the finest legal brains exercise themselves in arguments about antique bedpans and reasonable pedicure costs, the function of the trophy wife and the meaning of the word 'fairness'.</p> <p>In the last few days, a procession of experts from the world of - to use a technical term - 'big-money cases', has obliged with stimulating, if characteristically inconsistent, estimates on the loot that might be Mr Ritchie's (and, by extension, theirs) supposing he found the right person to rubbish the mother of his children, and promote his parallel claims to victimhood and entitlement. Twenty million? Fifty? Three times that? For does not seven years now pass for an enduring marriage? Compared with the childless Melissa Miller's three years (\u00a35m)? And Heather Mills's four (\u00a324.3m)? And does not Ritchie, after heroic tolerance of Madonna's macrobiotic regime, have a reasonable expectation of, at the least, a lifetime's supply of illuminated, red velvet-lined cuff link drawers? Paid for by the woman whose crazed gym attendance and appetite for Malawian adoption may or may not be found to meet the definition of relevant conduct when (as we must fear, despite this profession's profound commitment to child welfare) the dispute transfers to the West End, or as it might be, the bedpan-focused majesty of London's High Court?</p> <p>Though there can be few certainties in the muddle that is British divorce law, the affluent Ritchie has reason to think himself entitled to a decentish gratuity from his missus's fortune, no matter how negligible his contribution to the making of it. Remember the insane divorce pay-outs recently authorised by leading British judges, possibly out of some perverted belief that they are righting ancient offences against women. As Baroness Hale argued, before confirming Melissa Miller's \u00a35m, it is easy to count the rich partner's money, or property. But think of the time you can spend getting your highlights done. 'It is impossible to count the value which the other has added to their lives together.'</p> <p>Equally, it is impossible to quantify the impact on Ritchie's reputation if he were to set an example: choosing personal dignity over the legal profession's massed exhortation to act like a creep. You can't put a price on morality, can you? Well, actually you can. It's \u00a315. That's how much it costs to experience Madonna's Kabbalistic wisdom, in the story Lotsa de Casha: 'When you learn to share, you will not only find happiness. You will also find a friend.' Just so long as he's not an emotional retard.</p>",
  "<h2>Escargots \u00e0 la Bourguignonne</h2> <p>It was the furiously hot and bubbling arrival of this dish at the famous old Paris bistro, Chez l'Ami Louis, that was the original inspiration for this recipe. And these snails have been on the menu at Bibendum, without exception, since day one.</p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>48 canned snails<br>48 snail shells (these are usually sold together)<br>a large glass of white wine<br>a large pinch of herbes de Provence<br>salt and pepper</strong></p> <p>For the snail butter:</p> <p><strong>450g unsalted butter, softened<br>50g peeled garlic, as fresh as possible, finely chopped<br>75g flat-leaf parsley, leaves only<br>25g dry breadcrumbs<br>50ml Pernod<br>1\u00bd tsp salt<br>\u00bd tsp black pepper<br>\u00bc tsp cayenne<br>5 drops Tabasco sauce</strong></p> <p>You will need four traditional snail dishes, each with 12 indentations, or, for smaller servings, dishes with only six indentations. The butter recipe should then be halved.</p> <p>To make the snail butter, put the butter and garlic in an electric mixer and beat together. Blanch half the parsley briefly in boiling water. Drain, refresh under cold running water, and squeeze dry. Chop this and the remaining parsley as finely as possible. Add to the butter with the remaining ingredients and beat together until thoroughly blended. Chill.</p> <p>Place a baking sheet in the oven while it is heating to 230\u00baC/Gas 8.</p> <p>Drain the snails and put in a pan with the wine, herbs and seasoning. Bring up to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes or so. Leave in the liquor to cool, then drain. They are now ready to use.</p> <p>Firstly, using your thumb, push a small amount of snail butter (about half a teaspoon) into the bottom of a snail shell, then insert a snail, with its curved and pointed end uppermost. Gently push it further down into the shell and then top up with more butter - about 3-4 times the amount than before - and smooth off around the aperture of the shell, leaving behind a concave surface, so that, hopefully, most of the butter will remain inside the shell as it heats through in the oven. Repeat until all the shells have been filled.</p> <p>Place the shells on the dishes with their apertures as horizontal as possible. Arrange on the baking sheet and bake on the top shelf of the pre-heated oven for 15-20 minutes. Serve very much at once, with plenty of bread.</p> <h2>Mussels in Gew\u00fcrztraminer with chives and cream</h2> <p>A refined version of the French classic moules \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me. The Gew\u00fcrztraminer's fruity flavour works wonders with the mussels.</p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>2 kg mussels<br>100g unsalted butter <br>50g diced carrot (2-3mm square)<br>50g diced leek (2-3mm square)<br>50g diced celery (2-3mm square)<br>50g shallot, finely chopped <br>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped <br>375ml Gew\u00fcrztraminer<br>125ml double cream<br>\u00bd lemon<br>1 bunch of chives, finely chopped <br>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>First make sure the mussels are clean by rinsing them in cold water and going through them one at a time, discarding any open mussels, and removing the beard that is a stringy bit that can stick out the side of the shells; if you just pinch it with your fingers and pull hard, it will come away.</p> <p>In a large saucepan with a lid, melt the butter and gently fry the vegetables and garlic without colouring them, stirring frequently. After five minutes add the wine and boil until it has reduced by half. </p> <p>Now add the mussels and cover the pan with a lid. Gently shake the pan to and fro keeping the lid on with one hand and holding on to the pan handle with the other. </p> <p>After three minutes lift the lid and peek at the mussels; if they are not yet all open return to the heat and shake for another minute or two until open. Discard any that remain closed.</p> <p>Now add the cream and stir it in. Taste the liquid in the bottom of the pan and season with salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p> <p>You are now ready to serve so stir in the chopped chives and serve in deep bowls, making sure to pour in plenty of sauce.</p> <h2>Fish and chips</h2> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>4 cod fillets, about 175g each<br>seasoned flour, for dusting<br>oil, for deep-frying the fish </strong></p> <p>For the batter:</p> <p><strong>200g plain flour<br>50g potato flour (f\u00e9cule)<br>1 bottle of beer (300ml)<br>1 egg yolk<br>25ml oil<br>250ml milk<br>salt and pepper</strong></p> <p>For the chips:</p> <p><strong>4 large floury potatoes<br>groundnut oil, for deep-frying</strong></p> <p>To make the batter, blend all the ingredients together, sieve and leave to rest for an hour.</p> <p>Depending on whether you like your chips thin or thick, cut the potatoes lengthwise into the appropriate thickness. Then wash under cold running water until the water is clear and rid of all the starch. Drain in a colander and leave to dry before frying.</p> <p>In a suitable pan or an electric deep-fryer, heat the oil for the chips until it has reached 150\u00baC. Put in the chips and fry for 6-7 minutes. Lift one out and check it. It should be soft right through. If not, then give them another minute or so. Lift them out and allow to drain. Increase the temperature of the oil to 185\u00baC.</p> <p>Meanwhile, heat the oil for the fish to 180\u00baC. Dip the cod in the seasoned flour, then immediately into the batter and deep-fry for 5-7 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. </p> <p>Fry the chips a second time between 30 seconds and 2 minutes. This depends very much on the type of potato. Certain potatoes just will not crisp, so ask your greengrocer which are best. </p> <h2>Roast mallard with spiced quince compote</h2> <p>Mallard is a lovely game bird when served pink and juicy so be careful not to overcook it or it will become dry and tough.</p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p>For the quince compote syrup:</p> <p><strong>4 large quinces<br>1kg caster sugar<br>1 litre water<br>4 bay leaves<br>12 cloves<br>1 cinnamon stick<br>juice and zest of 2 oranges<br>juice and zest of 2 lemons</strong></p> <p>For the mallards:</p> <p><strong>50g unsalted butter, softened <br>2 mallards <br>125ml red wine<br>100ml fresh chicken or game stock<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>To make the quince compote syrup, peel the quinces, cut them into quarters then remove the core. Put the quarters of quince in the fridge. Place the peelings and core in a saucepan with all the other compote ingredients and bring to the boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer and leave for 3 hours. The syrup will develop a lovely deep rust colour. After 3 hours sieve the syrup then return it to the saucepan. Now add the quince quarters and simmer gently for 1 hour or until soft. Leave to cool before refrigerating until needed.</p> <p>Smear the butter all over the birds and season with salt and pepper. Heat a large flamproof dish on the hob and fry the birds, breast-side down until the breasts are golden. Then place in a preheated oven, 200\u00baC/Gas 6, and cook for 15-20 minutes so they remain pink. Remove from the oven, transfer the birds to another dish and allow to rest somewhere warm. Return the roasting dish to the hob to make a quick gravy. Add the red wine and bring to the boil. Using a whisk, scrape away the bits stuck to the bottom of the dish and allow the wine to reduce by half. Add the stock and 50ml of the quince syrup and allow this to reduce some more until a tasty, slightly sweet gravy is achieved.</p> <p>Now warm up 4 quince quarters and some of the syrup. Carve the mallards, and pour any of the blood and roasting juices into the gravy. Serve half a bird each with a quarter of a quince and spoon over the gravy.</p> <h2>Roast peaches with ricotta, almonds and port</h2> <p>Serves 6</p> <p><strong>200g amaretti biscuits<br>75g unsalted butter <br>150g flaked almonds<br>grated zest of 2 oranges<br>100g ricotta<br>2 egg yolks<br>50ml Armagnac<br>6 peaches<br>4 tbs caster sugar<br>1 bottle of port</strong></p> <p>In a large mixing bowl, crush the biscuits with the end of a rolling pin. Then by hand mix in the butter, almonds, orange zest, ricotta, egg yolks and Armagnac. Split the peaches in half and remove the stones. Place cut side up, in a roasting tin. </p> <p>Put a walnut-sized piece of the filling on each peach half. Scatter 1 teaspoon of sugar over each half and add the port. Roast the peaches in a preheated oven, 180\u00baC/Gas 4, for 20 minutes. Remove the peaches from the tin and keep warm. Pour the port into a saucepan. Boil to reduce to a syrup - add sugar if not sweet enough. Serve 2 halves to each person and drizzle with the syrup. Add a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.</p> <h2>Sussex pond pudding</h2> <p>Serves 4</p> <p>For the pastry:</p> <p><strong>400g self-raising flour<br>200g suet<br>pinch of salt <br>125m milk<br>125ml water</strong></p> <p>For the filling:</p> <p><strong>2 lemons<br>unsalted butter <br>demerara sugar <br>Butter 4 x 250ml heatproof plastic pudding basins.</strong></p> <p>To make the pastry, mix the flour, suet and salt together in a large bowl. Then add the milk and with your fingers, start to work into a dough. When you have added all the milk start to add the water. You may not need all of this. Keep working until you have a dough you can roll out with a rolling pin. Roll the dough out to 3-4mm thick and then cut out 4 circles big enough to line the basins. </p> <p>A side plate is a good size to use as a template. Now cut out one-quarter of each circle. Place the remaining three-quarters in each basin, bringing the 2 cut edges together to overlap a little bit. Push the pastry down into the basins. Seal the overlap firmly. </p> <p>To make the filling, weigh the lemons and then weigh out the same amount of butter and of sugar. Cut the lemons and butter into 1cm chunks. Mix in a bowl with the sugar and then fill each of the lined basins with the filling. </p> <p>Now roll the remaining pastry quarters into circles and cut to fit as lids. Pinch the lining and lid firmly together to make a tight seal. Cover the top of each pudding with foil with a pleat folded across it. Place the puddings in a steamer with a tightly fitting lid, over a saucepan of simmering water. Leave to boil gently for 3 hours. Top up with boiling water, if necessary. To serve, remove the foil and turn the puddings out into bowls - don't forget the cream! </p> <p>\u2022 The Bibendum Cookbook by Terence Conran, Simon Hopkinson and Matthew Harris is published by Conran Octopus, \u00a325.

  "<p>Patrice Evra likes to smile, enjoys a laugh, revels in a wind-up. Today's target: Rio Ferdinand. Fellow Manchester United defender, sometime television presenter, all-times style-conscious modern sportsman. Yet, it appears, second-best to a certain Frenchman as dressing room DJ.</p> <p>'I fight with Rio because all the time he's saying he's got better songs,' Evra says. 'But my iPod is the best in the dressing room. I say that because it's the truth. They ask me because I have different songs. I can put the hip-hop song, I can put the rock song. I mix the song for everybody in the dressing room - not just for myself or for some guys; for everybody. I want to see everybody happy when I put my iPod on before the game. When the players say, \"Come on Pat, put your iPod on,\" I know the game starts now.'</p> <p>Evra won't reveal which hip-hop number best pleases Sir Alex Ferguson, but lets slip the favoured status of one Yves Larock dance anthem. 'You know the one,' he says, breaking into song. \"'My dream is to fly - over the rainbow - so high.\" \"Rise Up\" is a good song. Sometimes people say, \"Pat, it's too high,\" but I say \"no problem\" and I put the volume higher.'</p> <p>Despite his musical expertise, Evra is some way off being the most celebrated member of a team who are holders of the Champions League and Premier League, a team sculpted from some of the world game's most talented young footballers. This is partly by design; an unjustified lack of confidence in speaking English steering him away from domestic media activities for most of his 34 months in Manchester. It has nothing to do with the way he plays the game. Athleticism, speed and comfort on the ball make him central to both defence and attack - United win 10 per cent more games and concede a third fewer goals when Evra is present.</p> <p>Voted the Premier League's best left-back in 2006-07 by his fellow players, the 27-year-old has developed into one of the finest exponents of an increasingly important discipline. Long gone is the nauseous, ill-prepared ing\u00e9nu bashed up by Manchester City just four days after signing from Monaco in January 2006. 'Patrice has developed into one of the best full-backs in world football,' Ferguson says. 'And his infectious personality has helped build an incredible team spirit.'</p> <p>Born in Dakar, Senegal, but raised in the tough Parisian quartier of Les Ulis as one of a Senegalese diplomat's 24 offspring, Evra learned the meanings of loyalty and teamwork from an early age. He has been with his wife Sandra for 14 years, meeting at school and emigrating to Italy together, as the then unrated striker struggled to establish himself. 'My first girlfriend, and I hope my last,' says a laughing Evra, who clearly does not intend to emulate his thrice-divorced father. 'Twenty-four brothers and sisters - I say my daddy did not watch the TV, he had some occupation more important! When I'm on the phone the players joke. Cristiano says, \"Hey Pat, this is the number 20? This is the number four?\"'</p> <p>The relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo is typical of the warmth Evra has for his team-mates. A friendship that goes far beyond professional co-operation. 'We're very close because he's a good guy and I like when people enjoy every day,' the France defender says. 'We joke about the clothes, and when my English is not the best he takes the piss out of me. When Cristiano comes into training he's always smiling; you just give him the ball. Maybe he watches TV with the ball, he sleeps with the ball, he eats with the ball. Even when we do bike work he tries to do some skill with the ball. It's just unbelievable when you're training with him. But all the time I'm saying, \"Cristiano, if you do some skill and I feel shame around the people, I'll give you the bad tackle...\"'</p> <p>Again the Evra grin, though he acknowledges the benefits of working daily with Ronaldo. Evra was a wilfully reluctant convert to defending, and it was not until he reached the Champions League final with Monaco, in 2004, that he reconciled himself to the left-back role. Part of his effectiveness is a recognition that he is still mastering the art.</p> <p>'The most important thing I think is the balance. If you're getting forward a lot of people say, \"Ah, but he's not defending very well.\" If you defend well people say, \"Yeah, but he's not going forward for some good crosses.\" It is a difficult position, but I like it because you touch the ball a lot. You're important. I understand now why the left-back is the good position.</p> <p>'I remember when I played against Barcelona people told me, \"Messi, Messi, he's a great player.\" I didn't say to nobody but in my head I was thinking, \"If I'm training against Cristiano, why can't I play against Lionel Messi?\" It helps you a lot, you feel like you are a good defender because when you stop a player like Cristiano Ronaldo in training you feel more confident. I can play against every winger or striker.</p> <p>'The secret is just to get close, to not let him have the first touch. If he goes quickly with the ball it is very difficult to stop a player like Messi or Cristiano. You need to get in strong and close. Not foul, but strong and close. And after you can enjoy your game. But if you let him get with the ball, and let him run at you it's very difficult. Cristiano, I think nobody can stop him if he's running. Nobody can stop a player like that.'</p> <p>Ferguson may argue otherwise after another summer stymieing the winger's wanderlust. Instead, a less celebrated Portuguese departed Old Trafford, though the loss was still significant. 'Honestly, Carlos Queiroz was very important for the squad because he knew very well the tactics,' says Evra, a beneficiary of Queiroz's ability with the French language and his daily defensive coaching.</p> <p>'I remember the semi-final against Barcelona away when he was speaking with everybody before the second half. The tactic was to have the team very compact and to let Barcelona play with the ball. He said possession didn't matter. \"Stay compact and when you win the ball go forward as quickly as possible.\" I was feeling the team very strong at Barcelona, and I think this was the work of Carlos Queiroz. Tactically he brought something important to Man United.\"</p> <p>United resume their defence of the European Cup when Celtic visit Old Trafford on Tuesday. One reason they hold the trophy, argues Evra, is because they have been taught to approach Champions League matches in a more conservative manner than domestic games. 'You can't play the European game the same. The boss says it as well. It's totally different because in Europe you have to have 100 per cent concentration. If you miss one control, you lose the ball, they score. It's like that.</p> <p>'We work a lot tactically in training as well. You see the video a lot after your game - the boss shows you your mistake. In the league you do the video just three hours before the game, but Champions League you do the video two days before the game, one day before the game and the day of the game. Three sessions. This is why I say the team is more mature now - because everybody understands that you can't play the same way the European game as the League game.'</p> <p>Different rhythms, but Evra is master of both.</p>",
  "<p>This is one of the shows of a lifetime. Even at twice the size it could not have been more thrilling or profound. Part of its genius is to begin with such a jolt that everything appears new from the start, for the first picture you see - of a strawberry blond aristocrat bristling with golden hairpins - is also the only female portrait that survives from as far back as 1400. Portraits were as rare as hens' teeth, so imagine how they must have startled those who had never seen one before. Someone living, or once living, suddenly reappears as themselves and possibly life-sized? No wonder people were amazed, excited, afraid. </p> <p>Even a century later it was common never to have seen a recognisable likeness, and when Raphael's Pope Julius II was displayed in a Roman church just after his death in 1513, the people who flocked to see it were 'struck with fear', said Vasari, 'to see it so lifelike and true'. For once the old strain of art praise rings true, for although the man we see now may look sly and infirm, he was in his day a notoriously aggressive operator.</p> <p>Julius is here, paired (for the first time) with Titian's deathless portrait of his successor, wilting beneath the weight of office. So are Bellini's Doge Loredan, cut out of his brilliant blue background with frightening precision, and Holbein's spry young Christina of Denmark, a portrait so acute in its characterisation that it is easy to believe in her celebrated quip, on being wooed by Henry VIII, that if she had only had two heads then she might have given one to him. </p> <p>Here are Erasmus and Aretino, and Henry as a laughing child, sculpted and not a little sinister with his bright milk teeth; Jan van Eyck reunited with his wife (also for the first time) so that one sees a time-tested parity between them. Here is D\u00fcrer naked and pointing to the place where it hurts, in the most eloquent visual aid for a doctor ever made; and Ugly Duchess by Quinten Massys, which the curators have now managed to show is the portrait of a woman likely deformed by a dreadful bone disease. By pairing her with her husband (another first), so that you see she is offering him a rose and he is gently reaching out to her, they have also scotched centuries of vile aspersions to the effect that she is too vain to realise how ugly she looks, and produced the revelation of a tender and possibly humorous couple instead. This is brilliant and humane scholarship.</p> <p>With portraits, no matter how brief or faltering the illusion, there is always the sense of coming face to face with another person before that person reverts to an image; even to modern eyes, image-weary, this show offers a tremendous succession of encounters. Gerlach Flicke, imprisoned in the Tower of London by Bloody Mary, painted himself with the red-haired pirate Henry Strangways in a tiny diptych: fellow prisoners in cramped cells. Mary herself, depicted by Anthonis Mors, is erect and stony before an overbearing column; it is no stretch to imagine her attacking a picture of her husband Philip II of Spain when he refused to live with her in London. Philip in turn is portrayed in close-up and full length, as a bust and a life-sized statue so that you have the sense as never before of the man as he stood, bodied forth in real life.</p> <p>Van Eyck and Titian, D\u00fcrer and Bellini: this show has a vivid subtext, which is that Italy has trumped the Low Countries for too long in received wisdom and that the innovations very often come from the north. This is not drubbed home as it would be by lesser curators but presented purely through images: the pictures speak for themselves.</p> <p>Most Italians had never seen a two-eyed portrait, for instance, as opposed to a profile, until Flemish portraits began to appear in the south. When Botticelli shows his beautiful youth facing directly to the front, that most persuasive of person-to-person poses, he is doing only what Van Eyck has done before him. When D\u00fcrer tilts a head, moves an arm, parts the fingers and follows the motion through the eyes, he sends energy through his half-length figures when Florentine painters were still showing them as statues truncated at the waist.</p> <p>Animation is the object of the art, and the whole story, it seems to me, of this show. It wants to gives you the strongest possible sense of the Renaissance as a revolution in portraiture - and it entirely succeeds. </p> <p>Partly this is a feat of staging. A man holds up a medal of Nero, and there is the real medal, hey presto, presented below. Two morose bankers eyeball each other across a crowded room. The hand movement in one portrait appears to continue through the next, and the next, like a wave. Solo portraits multiply into double portraits, then trios and eventually whole families. You will never see, incidentally, more engaging images of children five centuries lost to death.</p> <p>But of course it is the gift of the art itself. These long-dead faces look back at you, living once more; each picture is an advance on the next. The tailor pauses, about to make the first cut. The scholar raises a warning finger. The grey-eyed beauty looks shyly downwards as she turns our way, her smile sealing the astonishing intimacy of the image.</p> <p>Some of these works have never been shown in Britain before. One - Pontormo's swaggering Romeo in black silk - is newly discovered. Many are from the National Gallery's unparalleled collection, but all look completely new in this dramatic all-together-now context.</p> <p>What they show, above all, is the triumph of art over drastic constraints. For what is a portrait after all but a flat figure in a box, which must somehow be brought to life? Contemporaries often thought the transformation supernatural, and it may be spellbinding even today. That is how it appears at the end of Renaissance Faces, as Ghirlandaio's old man, eyes sunk in death, quickens between chalk drawing and poignant portrait. He opens his eyes and clasps his little grandchild, returning to love and life.</p>",

Photograph: Desmond Boylan/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Desmond Boylan/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n is known in his native Spain, quite simply, as the 'superjuez' - the super-judge. It is a double-edged compliment, implying not just the crusading zeal of a comic superhero but a weakness for pursuing both outlandish, eye-catching causes and personal fame. With his neatly slicked-back hair and earnest, bespectacled gaze, Garz\u00f3n bears a passing resemblance to that most famous of superheroes, Clark Kent. As with Superman, the sudden, frenzied bursts of action of this most controversial of judicial activists are dramatic and dazzling.</p> <p>Last week Garz\u00f3n dominated both newspaper headlines and the tapas-time conversations with his decision to launch a case against the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco for crimes against humanity. The judge is chasing a ghost: Franco died 33 years ago. By doing so, however, he has delved dangerously into the darker reaches of the nation's subconscious and blasted away a tacit agreement not to rake over the past.</p> <p>One outraged conservative politician likened his initiative to trying to put Napoleon on trial. 'It is outlandish,' stormed Manuel Fraga, founder of the opposition right-wing People's Party and a former Franco minister. 'There were amnesty laws.'</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has never thought small. He is putting an entire era of Spanish history on trial. The 64-page document he released laid out the charges. Franco was not just a reactionary right-wing rebel who ousted an elected government, plunged his country into a bloody three-year civil war and ruled as dictator for 36 years. He was also a monster who set about the deliberate annihilation of more than 100,000 opponents.</p> <p>Franco was aided and abetted by men who, like the dictator, still have streets and squares named after them. None, however, will face their accuser - for all are dead. As such, some point out, they cannot defend themselves. Even those he is trying to help are not all appreciative. Garz\u00f3n ordered 19 mass graves to be dug up. One contained the body of poet and playwright Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. 'That is profanation of my uncle's grave,' complained Garcia Lorca's nephew, Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez-Montesinos.</p> <p>Time will tell whether Garz\u00f3n, like Don Quixote, is tilting at windmills. The case against Francoism, however, comes as no surprise to seasoned Garz\u00f3n-watchers. He was an atypical magistrate from the start. The child of a petrol-pump attendant from a poor corner of the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda does not normally make it this far. The ma\u00f1ana reputation of his fellow southerners, however, was never for him. Garz\u00f3n's father insisted that, to get on: 'You have to see the sun rise.'</p> <p>Even as a radical left-wing student during the last days of Francoism and early days of democracy, he never forgot that advice. He became the youngest magistrate at the immensely powerful National Court in 1988. He was just 32.</p> <p>An investigating magistrate wields, by British standards, extraordinary power. He does not conduct trials, but prepares them. He helps coordinate the police enquiry, jails or bails suspects and, eventually, decides whether to bring charges. For a magistrado in the National Court the power is even greater. From drug barons and terrorists to international arms dealers and corrupt bankers, this is where Spain's biggest crooks and highest profile cases end up.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n was a new kind of magistrado. He was instinctively left wing, intensely hard working and aware of his own abilities and the importance of his job. Even now, he complains, some judges still work mornings at their court and then earn money, cash in hand, in the afternoons by teaching. 'Nobody tries to do anything about it and, presumably, nobody will,' Garz\u00f3n complained in a best-selling autobiography.</p> <p>State corruption soon fell into his sights. Garz\u00f3n, it became apparent, liked to aim high. Almost immediately he locked horns with the Socialist government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez over a state-run dirty war against the Basque terror group Eta. It claimed 27 lives, though a third of victims had nothing to do with the group. The foot soldiers were hired mercenaries and assassins working under the name of the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n (GAL) - a group founded and funded by the interior ministry.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n shocked the government by arresting police officers and interior ministry officials. He soon became famous and lauded. He even began to make celebrity appearances at pro-am charity soccer matches, donning the goalkeeper's jersey. Some, inevitably, began to accuse him of deliberately seeking to be centre stage. 'So what if he seeks protagonismo? Only those who seek to be protagonists move history,' noted the writer Francisco Umbral. </p> <p>Gonz\u00e1lez eventually decided to neutralise the biggest thorn in his side, by appealing to Garz\u00f3n's weak spot - his vanity. Rather than fight the judge, he hired him. In 1993 Garz\u00f3n became an 'independent' socialist candidate in the general election - number two on the party's Madrid list behind Gonz\u00e1lez himself. It was a brilliant move by Gonz\u00e1lez. Garz\u00f3n was a star. He added so many points to the socialists' poll rating that it instantly drew level with its right-wing opponents in the People's Party. Gonz\u00e1lez, against the odds, won a fourth term.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n, having helped win votes, was sidelined. He did, however, have a chance to catch sight of the corruption around the interior ministry. 'There was a room full of watches, ties, scarves, pens ... that were for giving away as presents; and there was another room full of paintings. The truly amazing thing, however, was that it all disappeared in 24 hours,' he said. When Gonz\u00e1lez refused to sack a corrupt former interior minister, Garz\u00f3n resigned.</p> <p>He returned to his old job at the Audiencia Nacional where one of his first moves was to reopen the GAL case and look at interior ministry corruption in general. Some smelled revenge.</p> <p>The dirty tricks department of the interior ministry went into full swing. He was followed, his phone was tapped and his house broken into - twice. Once the visitors left a banana skin on a bed. It was a sinister calling card, a deliberate sign that they had been there.</p> <p>A special police team was formed to dig up dirt. 'It was Kafkaesque. They investigated to see whether I snorted cocaine, if I had orgies with champagne and prostitutes, if I was in charge of a network of police corruption or money-laundering, or if I was inclined towards paedophilia or homosexuality,' he said later. 'More than anger, it made me sad to see how far our democracy had degenerated.'</p> <p>He went on a radio show to denounce what was going on. 'If you don't show cowardice, if you keep going ... they end up assassinating you. That is what they did to Judge Giovanni Falcone [the Italian anti-mafia magistrate],' he said. It was a game, however, that Garz\u00f3n eventually won. The corrupt minister ended up in jail.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n, who moves in armour-plated cars and is accompanied everywhere by bodyguards, knew from the beginning that his was not a safe job. One of his closest friends, the prosecutor Carmen Tagle, was murdered by Eta in 1989. Garz\u00f3n swore to carry the fight back to them. Nowhere, indeed, has he been more controversial than in his willingness to take on Eta and its supporters.</p> <p>It was the discovery of international human rights law, however, that brought Garz\u00f3n fame beyond Spain - and a call for to be awarded a Nobel prize. His general willingness to test the limits of the law meant groups hoping to use the untried conventions of international human rights turned to him in the 1990s as they pursued Latin American military leaders who had escaped prosecution at home.</p> <p>When he discovered that Chile's General Augusto Pinochet had travelled to London in 1998, Garz\u00f3n had the general arrested and one of the most intriguing battles in recent British legal history began. The Law Lords eventually backed Garz\u00f3n - though a Labour Home Secretary, Jack Straw, used his powers to send Pinochet back to Chile.</p> <p>That did not stop Garz\u00f3n pursuing others. An Argentine navy captain, Adolfo Scilingo, was arrested, tried and convicted for his role in the death flights in which opponents of his country's military junta were pushed out of aeroplanes into the sea. Criticisms, however, were also made. Garz\u00f3n was applying international law to pursue human rights' abusers from almost any country - except Spain itself.

  "<p><strong>Audi RS6 Quattro Avant</strong><br><strong>\u00a377,730</strong><br><strong>CO2 per km: 333 Grams</strong><br><strong>Miles per gallon: 20.3 </strong><br><strong>Good for: alpha males</strong><br><strong>Bad for: beta blockers</strong></p> <p>Jonathan grips the squared-off steering wheel in both hands and shouts at the track surging towards us: 'It's an animal. It's a beast...' He lets out the kind of laugh Peter Mandelson probably did when he 'got the call' from GB, and pushes the accelerator further towards the carpet. The massive engine ignites, sending us hurtling into the future. There seems to be no limit to the power available to us. It's a 12-course gastronomic menu of automotive adrenaline. Jonathan seems composed and capable, but my heart is in my throat with the vision-blurring velocity we are travelling at. I begin to worry my heart might actually burst out of my mouth. But then I remember he is a heart surgeon, and I calm down; he'd be able to shove it back in. At last, he hits the massive six-piston calliper brakes and we slow to a gentler pace, as does my heart... Audi should consider offering a 'cardiac consultant' as an optional extra on some if its models.</p> <p>The RS6 is the most powerful production estate car available on the road. There are only six other production cars which have a comparable level of horsepower shovelled into them. They are the Strasbourg geese of the motoring world: the Bentley GT Speed, Ferrari 599, Pagani Zonda F, Lamborghini Murcielago and a pair of Mercedes-Benzes, the SLR and the S65 AMG. Notice that there are no Porsches in the club. No Aston Martins. No Maseratis. No Jaguars. This Audi is a supercar, and yet it is also a family estate. Which raises the obvious question: who will buy a \u00a377,730 estate car with a 572bhp, V10 Lamborghini engine squeezed under its aluminium hood? The first answer is: not very many people. The planned total volume, to be drip-fed on to our streets over the next three years, is a meagre 1,400. Will the owners be family men who like to drive fast? Surely not. No one wants to do 155mph with their little darlings strapped into the back and a terrified Labrador behind the dog guard. High-mileage salesmen? The pitiful fuel consumption would soon put them out of business. Publicity-shy celebs? Possibly, but they aren't going to need five seats and a big boot. It can only be high-speed smugglers. They need the ample storage space for contraband and the rocket-like acceleration to out-gun the cops. The real answer, actually, is me, or Jonathan, or you - if only we had the cash. And the reason is simple. You will never drive a more exhilarating yet practical, understated yet beautiful car.</p> <p>The RS6 has more power even than the R8 racing car which won Le Mans in 2005. The standard measurement of power is bhp, or brake horse power. Years ago, as small boys, we used to talk in hushed reverence of a car's top speed. But manufacturers can now make cars that go so fast their engines have to be electronically limited - usually to 155mph. So BMW's M5, Mercedes's E63 and the RS6 all do exactly the same speed, 155mph - it's death to Top Trump players. Therefore we small boys have to get excited about the time it takes you to get to those speeds - and the more bhp a car has, the greater its acceleration. And the RS6 has more bhp than any other car in its class.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Jessica Parker, Gerry Adams, and all those ordinary Brits and other foreigners who sought their Celtic idyll are going to have pay more for their rural Irish hideaway.</p> <p>The star of Sex and the City and the Sinn Fein president share a passion for Donegal, Ireland's second largest county and home to some of the most stunning scenery on the island. But along with thousands of others, both Irish and foreigners alike, they are now going to be taxed annually for owning holiday homes in Ireland.</p> <p>As part of one of the most brutal budgets in more than two decades, the Irish government announced last week it was slapping a tax on second homes. It will apply to anyone owning a holiday home, whether their first home is in the Republic of Ireland or abroad. Environmentalists and politicians who have been long campaigning for a holiday home tax have welcomed the move.</p> <p>Ireland's version of the UK's National Trust, An Taisce, said this weekend it hopes the tax will, along with the property crash in the Republic, put a halt to over-development in rural parts of the country. An Taisce's Ian Lumley also pointed out that the tax will give the Irish government the first idea since local rates were abolished in 1977 exactly how many holiday homes have actually been built. Fianna Fail won its last overall majority in a general election 31 years ago in part due to its promise to abolish all local government rates.</p> <p>'There has been an explosion of holiday homes in Ireland, the number of which we don't have a clue about. A lot of these developments have been an environmental disaster for parts of rural Ireland. Hopefully the tax will help put a check on the crash development of holiday homes,' Lumley said.</p> <p>He said it was ironic that it was harder for Northern Ireland citizens to build or buy holiday homes on scenic areas like the north Antrim coast than it was across the border in Donegal. Lumley warned, however, that the costs of collection must not exceed the revenue earned from the holiday tax itself.</p> <p>Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband, actor Matthew Broderick, own a white-washed traditional holiday cottage seven miles outside the Donegal port of Killybegs, not far from Muckross Head. North of the Hollywood couple's home in Ardara is the house belonging to retired school teacher Michelle Markham. Based in Belfast, Markham raised the question of whether cottages or houses owned by people from outside the Republic were in fact second homes. 'You could argue that, if you don't live in the Republic, then how does a house here constitute a second home,' she said. 'I'm sure there could be an interesting court case law study about this.'</p> <p>Markham insisted, however, that she was personally happy to pay the tax, which Ireland's Department of Finance is likely to set at around \u20ac200 per annum. 'When I come to Donegal from Belfast I always make it my business to buy in the local shops, to contribute to the local economy, to hire local labour in the county. I'm not one of these people who stock up in supermarkets in Northern Ireland before heading across the border to Donegal. The tax is fair enough, because if you use local services such as water then you should be prepared to pay for them.'</p> <p>Further north Gerry Adams owns a holiday home in Gortahurk, which in recent years has become a popular haunt of fellow Belfast and Derry republicans seeking their Gaelic Arcadia, including the late IRA strategist and one-time bomber Brian Keenan - an influx that has prompted some locals to label it the 'Costa del Provo'.</p> <p>Joe McHugh, the Fine Gael deputy who represents this same part of Donegal in the Dail, gave a belated welcome to the holiday home tax, which he claimed his party had first pioneered.</p> <p>'The tax is fair because a Donegal man or woman who owns a holiday home on, say, the Wexford coast over in the east will also have to pay it.' In McHugh's county alone there are an estimated 8,000 holiday homes, although the Fine Gael deputy said he believed the figure is higher. 'In the good times the Celtic Tiger only came to Donegal at the weekend and now that we are living in lean times it's only right that those who can afford second homes pay for the services they use,' he added.</p>",
  "<p>John Adams, one of the most revered living classical composers, has claimed that he is blacklisted in his native America and is being followed by the security services.</p> <p>The 61-year-old musician has accused the United States of being in the grip of a political and moral panic and has complained that he is now grilled by airport immigration officers whenever he flies home because of his controversial reputation. </p> <p>Adams made his name 20 years ago with his opera Nixon in China. Although it is now regarded as a landmark in modern music, the opera made headlines when it opened because it was heavily critical of the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger. Then the content of The Death of Klinghoffer, Adams's 1991 opera about the Palestinian Liberation Front's 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, provoked a storm of protest for its treatment of the murder of a disabled Jewish passenger.</p> <p>Interviewed on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters yesterday, Adams said he was now 'blacklisted'. 'I can't check in at the airport now without my ID being taken and being grilled. You know, I'm on a homeland security list, probably because of having written The Death of Klinghoffer, so I'm perfectly aware that I, like many artists and many thoughtful people in the country, am being followed.'</p> <p>The suggestion that Adams, who received a Pulitzer Prize for the choral work he wrote to commemorate the victims of 9/11, does not feel welcome in his own country will send shock waves through the musical world. The impact of his remarks will be amplified by the fact that his 2005 opera Doctor Atomic has its New York premiere at the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow, in a production directed by British film-maker Penny Woolcock.</p> <p>During the interview, presenter Petroc Trelawny asked Adams if he felt that America was living through an age of paranoia that resembled the McCarthy era of the Fifties.</p> <p>'Well it is, and of course Congress has continued to sign off on these Patriot Acts that continue to clip the wings of human rights,' said Adams, adding that poets, novelists and musicians with left-wing leanings are often watched, including, he said, the American composer Aaron Copland, who was 'hounded' all his life. 'I'm sure the FBI had a large file on him. So we artists assume that we are being followed.'</p> <p>Adams - whose autobiography, Hallelujah Junction, is out this month - was born in New Hampshire in 1947. His mother was a Democratic volunteer in the crucial presidential election primaries held there every four years. 'She was a passionate liberal and I've always had a fascination with political life,' he said.</p> <p>Adams went to Harvard in 1966, but abandoned his music studies for a factory job because he wanted to compose. His success was crowned following 9/11, when the New York Philharmonic invited him to compose an 'aural monument' to the victims of the terrorist attacks. His choral ode, On the Transmigration of Souls, was premiered by the orchestra in 2002.</p> <p>However, Adams believes that the Republican administration manipulated the memory of the attacks. '9/11 was a very glamorous event,' he said. 'I'm using the term in a very ironic sense - 3,000 people being killed; it's a terrible tragedy, but in the scale of human tragedy it's very small. </p> <p>'I think Americans went into what the novelist Philip Roth called \"an orgy of narcissism\" as a result of 9/11 - we kept replaying those images and kept re-reminding ourselves of what an indignation and how horrible and terrible that event was. And then, of course, we struck out by invading the wrong country.'</p>",
  "<p>In Rochester, Northumberland, the last village before Scotland, Rupert Mitford, the 6th Baron Redesdale, and Paul Parker, a pest controller, are examining a map. We are in Redesdale's kitchen, in a cottage that borders the Otterburn army base. Chinook helicopters fly low up the valley, the last stop before Helmand and Basra. Redesdale and Parker, however, are organising battle lines of their own. </p> <p>Redesdale, in a lived-in tweed jacket, eventually locates his home on the well-used Ordnance Survey. 'This house was ground zero,' he says. 'In the first six months we had cleared everything to here,' he gestures towards a wooded area to the south. 'May to June we got down to this line here. July we did Newcastle.'</p> <p>Parker, shaven headed, chips in, in his broad Geordie, tracing his finger along the Tyne. 'We were doing the damage in this area. They can swim, but they'd rather use the bridges. We hammered them here and here and here. Now we are really hunting them down in ones and twos.'</p> <p>Redesdale continues, with boyish excitement. 'We developed what we called our killing strategy. Hit them in the woods. Dipton Woods: we took 2,000 out. If you clear a woodland you suck all the surrounding population to it. Then you hit them again. Suck 'em in, hit them.'</p> <p>'Slaley Forest,' Parker says. 'We took 3,500 out of there. In the winter there's no cover and you can pick them off with the .22 rifle. They all get together in the cold. You can get eight or nine with a couple of shots. All huddled together. We just annihilated them.'</p> <p>Redesdale is a tall, consummately charming, slightly distracted man, who attended public schools in north London and studied archaeology at Newcastle. He can trace his bloodline back to the Norman conquests; the Mitford sisters were his great aunts. Having been relieved of his hereditary peerage in Blair's reforms, he became the youngest elected life peer and is now, at 41, the Liberal Democrat spokesman for the environment in the second chamber. Parker, who grew up in the west end of Newcastle, was not much for school. Once he was seven or eight he was off in the fields, rabbiting, shooting crows and starlings and selling them to local butchers for pies. He and Redesdale, who rents him a house up the road, are an unlikely double act. Together, camouflaged crusaders, they form the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership.</p> <p>This is not a resurgent Tufty Club. 'We only call ourselves the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership because if we called it the Grey Squirrel Annihilation League people might be a bit less sympathetic,' Redesdale announces, chuckling. 'But we do nothing with red squirrels apart from save them by killing grey squirrels!' </p> <p>In the two years of their existence, Redesdale and Parker have been remarkably successful. While other conservation groups go in for education or re-habitation, they favour genocide. With a recruited army of 900 volunteers - grannies and game wardens, families and farmers - they have slaughtered 19,500 grey squirrels in the past 18 months and claim to have cleared England's northernmost county of the rodent. The grannies, Redesdale suggests, tend to be the most bloodthirsty trappers. 'It's like: \"Can you beat it to death with a hammer and let me watch?\" We had one old dear who went inside and came back out with a sort of elephant gun: \"Do you want to shoot it with this?\"'</p> <p>Parker and Redesdale are now making plans for Yorkshire, if they can find funding. Parker really dreams, however, of getting down to London, 'taking out - what is it? - Hampstead Heath, the parks. Hit them in their own backyard.' This, Redesdale adds, despite the fact that his partner gets a nosebleed if he leaves Northumberland, and on the one occasion he tried London had a panic attack on the tube. Even so, the baron does not rule out the capital. Lately, he confesses, he has been testing kill traps in Tufnell Park.</p> <p>I first met Redesdale a few weeks earlier, in the House of Lords' tearoom. There he explained how his private army came together. A couple of years ago, he said, he felt he had been lacking purpose in his life. He had the peerage, his work, his wife, Helen (a lawyer), four wonderful kids, a house in north London, and the cottage and several hundred tenanted acres in the valley that bears his name, but he was lying awake wondering about the meaning of it all. 'Now,' he said, trying to suppress a giggle, 'I lie awake working out how to kill squirrels.'</p> <p>A man needs a hobby. In this case it began when Redesdale was asked to make a speech in the Lords about the plight of the red squirrel in March 2006. He had spent every summer of his childhood, the second youngest of seven children, and the only boy, in the woods around the cottage in Rochester; since these were strongholds of the red squirrel he knew a good deal about the subject. Most of all he knew, as every English schoolboy knew, how the native red thoroughbreds had been forced back by the rapacious American greys and now stood on the edge of extinction.</p> <p>The debate itself proved a catalyst in Redesdale's thinking. It was moved by Earl Peel, who described the red squirrel as 'an iconic creature, immortalised by Beatrix Potter'. These days, however, Peel went on, 'Squirrel Nutkin must think to himself, \"How could it have all gone so wretchedly wrong for me?\" Why couldn't he, like Tommy Brock, have employed a top public relations firm and secured himself as a logo for a major conservation body?' </p> <p>The grey squirrel was presented by Peel as the scourge of all right-thinking people, carrier of the brutal squirrel pox which wiped out any reds that came into contact with it in days. A scavenger, it was the black-eyed destroyer of trees and bird populations. Peel ended with an impassioned plea. 'Walking as I do through St James's Park from time to time, I cannot help noticing the absence of common or garden birds. Where are the tits?' he asked. 'Where are the warblers?'</p> <p>Redesdale picked up in the debate where Peel had left off. 'In Regent's Park,' he began, 'a grey squirrel came up to my son and me and actually climbed up my leg to look in my pocket...' Before he was able to add 'in search of nuts', Lord Hoyle butted in. 'In St James's Park one ran up my trouser leg and bit me!'</p> <p>These peer-bothering trouser rats were even now on the march. 'I have some woodland in Northumberland that has red squirrels,' Redesdale went on. 'Last year, however, we found our first grey squirrel - it had been killed in the road - so it will surely not be too long before the grey squirrels arrive. I am just on the edge of Kielder Forest, and it is very depressing to think that that last bastion is under threat...'</p> <p>Of course, no pillar of the establishment likes to see bastions threatened and this roused others to the fray. Lady Saltoun of Abernethy, who had red squirrels dancing on the lawns of her estate, had no doubt what we were dealing with. 'Red squirrels are rather like quiet, well-behaved people,' she observed, 'who do not make a nuisance or an exhibition of themselves, or commit crimes, and so do not get themselves into the papers in the vulgar way grey squirrels do.'</p> <p>The grey squirrels' celebrity-seeking hoodie behaviour was the least of it. Battalions of vulgarian American rodents were fanning out across Europe. Lord Chorley, who wondered if he might be the only member present who had taken tea with Beatrix Potter herself, in 1941 (she put him in mind of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle), spoke darkly of how, contrary to what the New Labour government had recently claimed, grey squirrels were right now massing on the continent. 'There are three colonies, if that is the right word, in Italy. At least one of them is in the process of crossing the Alps. If they get to Germany there will be a complete invasion taking place.'</p> <p>By the time Lord Inglewood took the floor, emotion was running high. 'Squirrels are said to be good to eat,' he declared. 'The great chef Brillat-Savarin created a banquet of grey squirrels stewed in Madeira, together with partridge wings en papillote and roast turkey.' Mr Jamie Oliver had to be summoned. Inglewood finished with a stirring call to arms. 'The red squirrels have had Chamberlains and not Churchills!' he cried. 'But it is Churchills that they need!'</p> <p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Rupert Redesdale is far from a bloodthirsty fellow - he had never killed anything in anger since he had been on Operation Raleigh in Africa in his gap year and it had been his turn to throttle a chicken - but something about the squirrels' plight stirred old emotions in his blood. He was a Mitford after all.</p> <p>It was, he decided, not just the pox that was killing red squirrels, it was bureaucracy. A whopping \u00a3626,000 of Lottery money had recently been awarded to a group called Save our Squirrels, drawn from various nature conservation agencies, but the money had been given on the understanding that none of it would be used to pursue what seemed to be the only hope of salvation for the beleaguered native rodent: it could not be spent on culling greys. </p> <p>Redesdale spoke to the relevant office at Defra to point out the absurdity of this. There were more than 2m greys and only, at best, 160,000 reds. Appeasement was not an option. Defra suggested to him that as they were coming to the end of their budgetary year there might be some funds available. So Redesdale sat up over the following weekend and produced a grant application. It was a strange kind of document. In the space marked 'turnover' he wrote 'nil', in that for 'product' he listed 'dead squirrels'. Still, he got the money, nearly \u00a3150,000 of it, and then sat at his kitchen table and worked out how best to spend it.</p> <p>The original plan was to start lots of little squirrel groups all over the county, spread the word about the danger and get people to start trapping. In the event, Redesdale, a man who never quite seems in control of his laughter, found he was spending more time on team-building than on carnage. Save our Squirrels wanted to be involved. They had four full-time squirrel preservation officers who came to meetings. </p> <p>There was much discussion about whether it was possible to use the 'k' word - 'cull was OK, kill apparently was not,' Redesdale recalls. There was fear of reprisals. At the first board meeting of the RSPP they spent an hour discussing what they would do when the first death threat came in. 'We decided we were quite lucky because they had just arrested most of the Animal Liberation Front,' Redesdale remembers. (They have so far received four letters of complaint, one suggesting a grey squirrel zoo.)</p> <p>Just when he was starting to despair, however, Redesdale met Paul Parker. The pest controller was of the opinion that 'you can be through the area and have cleared it of squirrels by the time you have bought the biscuits for a coffee morning'. They worked on a new foolproof trap, and found a local man to knock up 1,000 in his shed. And it was then, Redesdale recalls, that they really started motoring.</p> <p>There are some pest control vans that favour discretion. The kind that, if parked in a restaurant car park, might keep the patrons guessing about their purpose. Paul Parker's van is not one of those. On back and sides, in the largest possible type, are the words 'Bees, wasps, bed bugs, squirrels, fleas, cockroaches, rodents, rabbits. You hate them, we love them!' There is, too, a squirrel hotline number. If a grey is spotted anywhere in the county, Parker will be on its case immediately with his traps and his rifles. In this way, he reckons, he has been covering up to 4,000 miles in a week.</p> <p>At any moment his phone could ring and we could be off to Hexham or Corbridge. From six in the morning people start calling and they don't stop until late at night. 'At 11 o'clock they've just come in from work, and there's a squirrel in the trap, they want me to shoot it. I can have 10 to do before I wake up in the morning.'</p> <p>This morning, however, Parker's phone is stubbornly silent. There is, it seems, not a squirrel to be shot for 50 miles in any direction. We set off anyway on Parker's regular rounds, checking traps for nuts, catching up with his volunteer army, and while we drive he recounts tales of more memorable mornings. There was the drive-by shooting near Blaydon: 'We were doing about 40 and there's a grey by the side of the road, brushing its hair: I lined him up with the air rifle, bang, straight through the chest.' And Stumpy, the last grey in Slayley, who had lost half his tail. 'He was a swine, took us a couple of weeks to get him. We just fed him, waited until he eventually dropped his guard, and then: bam!'</p> <p>Parker is a superstitious man. In particular he will not pronounce the name of his most resolute adversary. When they crop up in conversation, rats are thus always 'long tails' or 'tin hats'. ('Pig' and 'monkey' are problematic words for him in this regard, too.) As we drive over bridges, he somewhat disconcertingly lifts his feet from the car's pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says. </p> <p>Mrs Sanderson, in Hexham, is a kindly looking woman, and at 82 the oldest volunteer in the RSPP. She is also among its most successful squirrel catchers. Over the past year or so she has taken about 40 squirrels from the trap under her bird table, though more, she muses, if you count all the nursing mothers among them. 'There would be the starving little ones with those, too, I suppose.'</p> <p>She remembers the days when the reds used to come to the back door of her council house. She hasn't seen one for years, but at least the traps give her something to watch with her breakfast. 'You are just willing them to get in there,' she says of the greys, 'when they come sniffing around, destroying everything.' At first, when Parker came to shoot a squirrel she wouldn't watch. But now she does. 'I give him a bag to carry them out in, too,' she explains. 'Actually it's one from the RSPCA.'</p> <p>I mention that a colony of unusually large black squirrels, a colour mutation of the grey, is establishing a stronghold in Cambridgeshire, because the females there seem to prefer the muscular new breed. Mrs Sanderson winces at the idea. Last night she dreamt that she opened her front door and there were two red squirrels on the steps there talking to her. 'They will come,' Parker reassures her, 'don't you worry.' Since the grey squirrel cull, red squirrels have started re-establishing themselves all over the county. One was recently seen in Jesmond Park in Newcastle. 'It gives people round here hope,' Parker observes, 'and they will be back here, too.'</p> <p>We wander out to inspect Mrs Sanderson's trap, in vain. We move on, scanning the horizon, in search of the last grey squirrel in Northumberland. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon we are at a quarry with Reg Ord, another member of Lord Redesdale's squirrel army. Ord, 42, is an infamous bouncer in Newcastle's Bigg Market (a 'nightclub ejection technician,' he suggests). As broad as he is tall, with a neck like a sack of cement, Ord's day job is manning a Tarmac weighbridge. The company gives him an hour a day for conservation projects - the certificates are on the walls of his Portakabin. In corners of the quarried land Ord thus puts out strips of tin to attract newts - 'mostly palmates', Ord says, 'plus the odd great-crested' - and he shoots squirrels. He's had 500 since he started, just around the site here, but none today.</p> <p>Parker suggests this is a sign they are winning, but Ord is not happy. Thing is, someone has been messing with his traps. Stamping on them, driving over them. He shows us the flattened items at the back of his Portakabin, all the while recounting tales of his history as a doorman. 'I've been shot at and stabbed and hit with lumps of wood and bricks and bottles. They only ever try it once, mind. Bloke phoned me up three in the morning, told me how he was going to shoot me, the calibre of the rifle and all. The police wanted me to wear a vest, but I had an idea who it was. Next time he came in the bar I really gave it to him...' Ord recalls the encounter with some relish. 'Had no calls since.'</p> <p>If you had a hankering to liberate grey squirrels, I can't help thinking, it is probably not Reg Ord's squirrel traps that you would choose to stamp on first. Does he have an idea who is doing it?</p> <p>'I've got my suspicions, but you cannot prove nowt. I'll find out though. And when I find the fucker, he'll have it, too.'</p> <p>We drive on. Parker's phone sits on the seat beside him, mute. The story is the same with all the other trappers we meet. On the way home, at the bridge near Corsham, after a squirrel-free day, Parker lifts his feet from the car pedals. 'Devil's water,' he says.</p> <p>The longer you spend in Northumberland the more you realise what a very long way from anywhere else it is. The Observer's photographer, Gary Calton, and I are staying in a curious country house hotel in Otterburn that was recently converted into a hostel for asylum seekers. When there was a local protest at the prospect of the incomers, however, it reverted to being a hotel. We are the only guests. They are preparing for a wedding at the weekend, at which all of the party will be dressed in orangutan costumes.</p> <p>Overnight, I begin to develop a theory that the suspicion about incomers has also fuelled some of the zeal of the squirrel operation. The greys, adaptable and robust, are evidence of Darwin in action. They hugely outbreed the reds - four to eight in a litter, three or four times a year. They also out-eat them. Reds, vegetarians, need a lot of seeds. The greys will eat anything. They will take mince pies from children's hands. In Scotland they will drink Irn Bru. There was a story of squirrels addicted to crack cocaine in Brixton. </p> <p>If there is a class war aspect to this struggle, the aristocracy brought it on themselves. The first grey squirrels came to Britain as amusing mementoes of the New World in the early 19th century. The gentry kept them in cages as pets. It is thought that in 1876 a Mr Brocklehurst, who had brought a pair over from America, released them to see how they would fare in the wild. </p> <p>With all of this in mind I go to sleep thinking even the House of Lords can't stop evolution. The following morning, though, Redesdale puts me right. </p> <p>'Your problem is that you have never seen a red squirrel,' he says. And it's true, I haven't. 'The first time you see a red squirrel you will get it immediately. The hairs stand up on your neck. Half the primates in the world are about to go extinct and here is an extraordinary animal native to this country that is about to disappear because we can't be bothered to save it. Paul and I have proved it can be done. The RSPCA says what we do, though legal, is unethical; Save our Squirrels call us cowboys. But how can it possibly be ethical to let a wonderful native animal be lost to future generations for ever?'</p> <p>Parker, still in his combat gear, is teary-eyed when it comes to reds.</p> <p>'I think they are mystical animals. There is something so spirited about them; I saw my first one back in the Seventies, but every time they still affect me the same way. To think they have been here since the Ice Age and we might be seeing the last of them here is something I really don't want to think about.'</p> <p>The news has been carrying items about how the ancient red squirrel population in Formby, Lancashire, has been quickly devastated by squirrel pox with the arrival of the grey. The conservation groups had given red squirrels 10 years in Northumberland; Redesdale reckons they had four, tops. Now at least they have a fighting chance. 'We have to keep vigilant,' he says, 'have to keep pushing the greys back.' </p> <p>Having failed to find a grey squirrel to shoot yesterday, today we are going in search of a red squirrel to photograph. The grounds of Eshott Hall in the northeast of the county are considered a good bet. For several hours, therefore, Gary and me and Paul Parker and Redesdale study the tree canopy for the movement of red squirrels - unlike the grey they rarely come to ground, and when they do they move like quicksilver.</p> <p>Eventually, with legs cramping up, we spot a pair high up in the tree under which we are crouching, whispering. Redesdale and Parker are right, it is a perfectly charged moment (though partly a relief to see any squirrel at all). Smaller than the greys, the red squirrels chase each other across the high branches. When they sense us they stop stock-still, and then they chatter furiously. Parker says it has been like this on the few occasions he has had a red in the traps. When he has let it go it has been away like liquid, but has always stopped halfway up a tree to fix him with a stare and chunter at top speed. 'It's like, \"Hey mate, you got the wrong man there.\"'</p> <p>Watching these squirrels Parker becomes reverential, almost spooked. 'The greys are just tin hats really. They are nothing like the reds. You see a red and every one is different, they have individual characters. Sharp eyes, little tufts on their ears. They respect the place they live in. A grey squirrel is just a grey squirrel.'</p> <p>Wondering whether it is possible for a squirrel to show respect, we leave Eshott and go in search of a fabled man who feeds red squirrels from his hand in Kielder Forest. We are led to his cottage at the side of Kielder Lake by word of mouth. Everyone knows the squirrel man. And when we get there we immediately see why he has his reputation.</p> <p>Having spent most of the day scanning treetops for red squirrels, suddenly they are everywhere, standing on their hind legs, hopping up to the cottage door. Don Clegg is a retired woodwork teacher with a hint of red about his beard. There have been squirrels coming down from the forest here for 20 years. At the moment they have about seven that arrive for monkey nuts every morning and in the afternoons. Over the years the numbers have dropped, but now they are coming back again. </p> <p>Clegg is all for Redesdale's campaign. They had Bill Oddie up here but, like the squirrels, like the SOS group, like the Wildlife Trust, he sat on the fence, wouldn't say that killing greys was the answer. To Clegg it's a no-brainer. What does he think makes the reds so special? </p> <p>'It's simple really,' he says, 'it's just like they belong here.'</p> <p>That evening over supper, Redesdale tells some tales of his Mitford aunts in their natural habitats. His relations with them were distant but formative. Jessica told him not to be so stupid when he boldly announced he wanted to be an army chaplain at the age of 16; Debo, Duchess of Devonshire, recently invited them all to tea at Chatsworth and they fretted about taking their son who was in the middle of potty training; Redesdale's father was absolutely scared stiff of Nancy. All the time he talks, though, the conversation comes back to squirrels. I wonder if he has ever eaten any. Somewhat sheepishly, he admits he hasn't. It seems to me the next day might be a good moment to start.</p> <p>We meet Parker in the morning behind enemy lines near the Angel of the North. On this side of the Tyne there are still plenty of greys and he has put some traps down here to assess the reserve strength of the population. He has his daughter Bronwyn with him in the van. 'She loves to tell her friends at school what she gets up to with her dad and the squirrels,' Parker says proudly. 'I don't,' says Bronwyn flatly.</p> <p>We walk up a hillside in the woods, checking traps. Two contain squirrels, both juvenile males apparently, anxiously checking the mesh for an exit. Parker takes them back to the van.</p> <p>'I shoot them in the back of the head,' he says. 'You have to shoot them just behind the ear. If you hit them in the middle of the skull you can miss the brain.'</p> <p>He lets them into the killing trap and trains an air gun through the mesh. The car door is open and a Queen CD is playing. As the squirrels find their way over to the gun barrel, 'Don't Stop Me Now' is booming. As squirrels number 19,547 and 19,548 are dispatched, thick blood seeping from their wounds, 'Another One Bites the Dust' might seem more appropriate.</p> <p>Parker puts the carcasses in the back of his van. He's had a call from Mrs Sanderson, who has caught another squirrel in her trap this morning, and we are to meet Lord Redesdale at her house. 'We are like the fourth emergency service,' he says.</p> <p>Along the way, Parker discusses the possibilities for a new kill trap that will dispense with the need for shooting. It's like a huge mouse trap, he says, but they have had a few near misses with fingers in setting it up, so it's not quite right yet. </p> <p>I wonder if he has a sense that the squirrels know they are being hunted now?</p> <p>'When it gets down to the last few in a wood, I'd say definitely,' Parker suggests. 'When they are on the back foot they all know about it. Then it's a question of getting into their minds, under their skins.'</p> <p>At the back of Mrs Sanderson's house another squirrel, out-thought, is awaiting its fate. Redesdale is already there and Parker suggests that he takes the shot.</p> <p>'If I must,' he says. He stands over the cage and shoots the squirrel, with some aplomb, from the hip. Blood stains Mrs Sanderson's patio, but she's impressed.</p> <p>'My, you are a good shot,' she says of Redesdale's marksmanship from two inches.</p> <p>'Well, he's a lord, he has to be,' Parker observes.</p> <p>We all stare down at the squirrel, just now a livewire. 'When you start you get very nervous. But after a while you get to know how to relax into it,' Redesdale says. </p> <p>The first 17,000 are the worst, I suppose.</p> <p>The peer is confident there was no suffering. 'It was a bit bothered, but it wasn't too bothered, and then it was dead.'</p> <p>It is decided with something just short of enthusiasm that we will have the squirrels for tea. For a year now the RSPP has been supplying Ridley's Fish and Game of Corbridge with dead squirrels, and a market has developed for the meat. Parker gets 75p a squirrel and David Ridley, who runs the business, sells them oven ready at \u00a32.25 wholesale, \u00a33.25 over the counter. There has been a good deal of mail-order interest, mainly from restaurants and individuals in London. Over the summer demand has far outstripped supply.</p> <p>The only problem, Ridley suggests when we get there, is that unlike rabbits, squirrels take a long time to skin. One of his skinners has it down to a fine art. He blowtorches them first to get rid of the fleas and then gets to work on the fur. Even so it still takes three minutes per animal. </p> <p>That skinner is not around today so Parker does the squirrels himself on a bench alongside a deadpan pigeon plucker. While Parker tears at the squirrels' stubborn skins, David Ridley discusses ways of cooking squirrels. 'They have no fat on them and they live mostly on berries and nuts so the flesh is sweet. I've roasted them. I've flash-fried them with fresh thyme.' One restaurant has done well with a confit of grey squirrel served with pine nuts; Ridley and Redesdale have been discussing the possibility of the canap\u00e9 market. And yes, each squirrel they sell does indeed have to carry the label 'May contain nuts'.</p> <p>Back at Redesdale's cottage, we present him with the flayed rodents, now under cellophane. He looks at them with forced cheer.</p> <p>There must be times when he regrets becoming the squirrels' champion. </p> <p>'It's like everything,' he suggests, smiling. 'It seemed like a good idea at the time.' </p> <p>Is that how Helen, his wife, feels about it, I wonder. Over the past couple of days she has offered an affectionately ironic chorus to her husband's obsession. </p> <p>'There is,' she says diplomatically, 'no doubt they are doing brilliantly for the reds, but it can take over rather.'</p> <p>'I'll cook 'em!' Redesdale suggests brightly, before displaying a rather worrying unfamiliarity with the hob controls.</p> <p>Eventually the squirrel sizzles dutifully in the pan. Small tufts of fur still cling to its flanks. Redesdale pokes at it with a spatula and laughs a little nervously. </p> <p>'What is it?' asks his elder daughter.</p> <p>'It's squiwwel!' her sister confirms.</p> <p>'Perhaps I should have quartered it,' Redesdale says. The skinned squirrel lies spatchcocked on its back, paws upwards.</p> <p>Paul Parker is due but there is no sign of him; Bronwyn, who has joined us for supper, suggests he is feeling a little tired. Or maybe he's sampled Redesdale's cooking before.</p> <p>At the stove, Redesdale discusses other media opportunities. 'We have been approached to do a TV series,' he confesses. 'BBC3 I think.'</p> <p>It might, I suggest, make a nice antidote to Springwatch - Northumberland Slaughter</p> <p>'Isn't BBC3 the comedy channel?' Lady Redesdale wonders, drily.</p> <p>Redesdale serves up the squirrel. He cuts a piece off and tucks in with some bravado, offering a commentary while chewing. 'This is the saddle. It's not bad, there's no fat on it.' In a reluctant John Selwyn Gummer moment he feeds a little to his children, and gives a sizeable pink-looking haunch to me. We all chew ruminatively on the slightly raw squirrel and think for a moment. 'It tastes like chicken,' we agree. </p> <p>'Very good chicken,' Redesdale suggests, optimistically. Not for the first time, his wife raises an eyebrow. </p> <p>On the draining board two more skinned rodents are waiting to be cooked. The more he eats, though, the more Redesdale brightens. 'This is rather wonderful,' he declares. 'We can now officially eat them into extinction!' He returns to the flesh and bones on his plate with the look of a man who has woken with the solution to a problem that had troubled him the night before.</p> <p>'One down,' I say, swallowing a gamey mouthful, 'and only 2m to go.'</p>",

  "<p>The credit crunch is spreading to the insurance industry: plunging share and bond markets are expected to spark steep bonus cuts and the return of penalties for investors wanting to cash in their life policies. Analysts fear the companies could be forced to cut dividends or raise new capital if the situation worsens.</p> <p>Cashing-in penalties, or 'market value reductions', were widespread as recently as three years ago as life companies' with-profits funds plunged in the wake of the 2000 stock market crash, but these were gradually being abolished. Danny Cox, head of advice at Hargreaves Lansdown, says that Legal &amp; General and Scottish Widows are among those to have reintroduced them for certain products, and he expects them to become more widespread as the price of all assets falls.</p> <p>He also expects bonuses to fall sharply, sending the value of maturing policies spiralling still lower. While life companies' with-profits funds have had a few good years after a dismal start to the decade, many of their payouts are still falling: Standard Life, for example, cut the payout on a 25-year, \u00a350-a-month mortgage endowment by 8.2 per cent to \u00a334,703 in August, while Friends Provident cut its payout by 7.25 per cent. Many companies - including giants such as Equitable Life and Scottish Mutual - have paid no bonuses for years, and the current market turmoil means a return to bonuses is likely to be delayed still further.</p> <p>Life insurers have so far weathered the financial turmoil better than the banks - which have had to be bailed out by the government - largely thanks to stringent new solvency requirements put in place by the Financial Services Authority. These forced the companies, which had traditionally invested most of their funds in equities, to hold a wider spread of assets to reduce the impact of a downturn in any one market. Now, those funds that are still open to new business generally hold around half their assets in equities, 40 per cent in property and bonds and 10 per cent in cash, while funds that are closed to new business can have all their investments in bonds.</p> <p>But the financial crisis has sent the value of all assets plunging. The stock market has fallen by a quarter in the past month alone and is down 40 per cent on its high for the year, while property values are collapsing: according to the IPD Index, commercial property has fallen by 18.1 per cent over the year to the end of September. </p> <p>Corporate bonds have also collapsed recently after an uncertain year, although the impact of the decline may have been cushioned by the dramatic rise in the price of government gilts as investors fled to safe havens. And dividends have been slashed, cutting the income for life funds. Last week's banking rescues were accompanied with restrictions on the payment of dividends from all the domestic banks, which have traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the total payout from British companies, while retailers and housebuilders have also imposed stringent cuts.</p> <p>'I cannot imagine that companies like Norwich Union, Prudential and Legal &amp; General will be able to avoid cutting their bonuses,' says Cox. 'The rules now say that companies have to distribute 90 per cent of the returns [on their with-profits funds], but if that fund has tumbled in value then the distribution will also fall.'</p> <p>Andy Cowan, head of private clients at adviser Towry Law, believes this underlines why with-profits funds are a poor choice for most investors: 'The way they are structured is so complicated that most investors do not understand how they work,' he says. Although they are heavily promoted to ordinary investors as a safe option, he thinks recent history shows that that is 'nonsense'. 'They are a bad way to run money,' he says.</p> <p>The FSA has been keeping a close eye on insurance companies to monitor any fallout from the banking collapse. Justin Urquhart Stewart of Seven Investment Management thinks investors should also be keeping a wary eye on the insurance companies in case excessive investment in bank bonds - whose value has plunged as the number of rescues has soared - and other lower-grade bonds hit their regulatory solvency ratios.</p> <p>Two insurers - Aviva and Friends Provident - have recently tried to reassure investors with statements and presentations about their capital strength. Aviva's chief executive, Andrew Moss, said that its surplus capital had risen from \u00a31.8bn at the end of June to \u00a31.9bn at the end of September, and that it had hedged against market falls so that even a 40 per cent drop in share prices would only cut the surplus by \u00a30.7bn - a better result than would have been achieved if such a drop had occurred in June. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Prudential's shares fell by a fifth last week on fears - robustly denied by the company - that it would have to raise extra capital while Legal &amp; General revealed its surplus capital had fallen by \u00a3500m in the three months to the end of September, and that a 30 per cent fall in prices since then would cut that by a further \u00a3900m. The FTSE 100 has fallen more than 15 per cent so far this month.</p> <p>James Pearce, insurance analyst at Cazenove, said in a recent note: 'The life companies could still catch cold from the banking crisis, but the transmission mechanism would be a combination of investment losses and debt defaults sufficient to undermine solvency, rather than a funding strike or retail run. This week's falls in equities apparently make solvency concerns increasingly pressing, but there has quietly been a major bull run in gilts, which has at least partially offset equity losses for most players.'</p> <p>But he added that, once regulators had switched their focus from repairing the balance sheets of the major banks, they could turn their attention to the life industry - which could mean dividend cuts or rights issues. </p> <p>Two international insurance companies have already collapsed - AIG in the US and Japan's Yamato Life - although these were caused by excessive exposure to underwriting of the kind of high-risk loans and derivatives that are behind the financial crash. British insurers generally have only limited exposure to AIG and failed investment bank Lehman, which also left a trail of insurance losses in its wake.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft paid no dividend for 17 years after it listed; Google has paid no dividends since it floated in 2004 and says it has no intention to do so in the future. But shareholders were happy because the rapid growth in sales and profits at both firms meant the value of their investments soared.</p> <p>The electricity and water businesses of United Utilities and Severn Trent are subject to strict government controls that limit their profit growth. But their shareholders are happy because they pay generous dividends that give investors a decent yield on their investment: United's shares yield 9.3 per cent while Severn Trent's offer 5 per cent.</p> <p>But what are investors to make of RBS, Lloyds TSB and HBOS? Following the bank bail-out, the government could end up owning 60 per cent of RBS and 40 per cent of a merged Lloyds TSB/HBOS. As the price of its support, the government has banned them from paying dividends, though it seems to be drawing back from its insistence that the prohibition will last for five years. </p> <p>But even if we were not about to enter a bruising recession that will see soaring bad debts and falling loan demand, the government's insistence that these banks reduce risks means profits will be falling rather than rising.</p> <p>So if there are no dividends and no profits growth, where will shareholders get their returns? Nigel Parsons, investment manager at financial adviser BestInvest, says this goes to the heart of how we value shares: 'The only way is to discount the future income streams you get from them, in other words their dividends.' He thinks the fact that the government is ruling out such payments was a key reason shares in these banks continued to fall last week, even after the government had guaranteed their futures with a capital injection.</p> <p>Given that the government is ploughing some \u00a3400bn - around \u00a36,700 for every Briton - into the banks, they are under pressure to make sure bank shareholders share the pain of their abject failure to control the risks of their businesses. But the government also wants to minimise the cost to the taxpayer and to offload its bank shareholdings to private investors as soon as it can. That means it is in the government's interest to make the shares at least moderately interesting to investors - indeed, if it does so, it may be able to persuade private buyers to take up some of the new shares being issued as part of the rescue.</p> <p>Dividends have certainly been a key part of banks' attraction to investors. While banks accounted for only around a fifth of the stock market's value - at least before the collapse in their shares - their dividends represented about 40 per cent of total dividend income. That made them a staple for most income funds and it is no surprise that these funds have been among the worst performers over the past year as dividends - and banks - have disappeared..</p> <p>Even Barclays, which is confident it can raise the \u00a36.5bn regulators require from private investors, has said it is cancelling this year's final dividend and, it seems, will be banned by the government from paying one next year. That just leaves two banks - HSBC and Standard Chartered - on the dividend list. While both are likely to suffer from a slowdown in their core Asian markets, their dividends are almost certainly safe, and HSBC's 5.5 per cent yield is particularly attractive.</p> <p>What should those who are still in the bailed-out banks do? Nick Raynor at The Share Centre thinks they should bite the bullet: 'Sell now and take what value is left. If the government is the majority owner, they are not going to race away.' Others, such as Bruce Wilson of financial advisers Helm Godfrey, think it is too late to sell: 'You should have done it a long time ago; this is not the right time to sell.'</p> <p>Holders must ask themselves two questions. First, how long is their investment horizon and second, what will they do with the money raised?</p> <p>If investors are happy to wait for 10 years for the shares to recover, it may be worth just tucking them away in a box. But if offloading them now would raise enough to make a decent investment elsewhere, it may be worth selling out to get faster growth. That could be as simple as putting the cash in a high-interest account until markets settle - Halifax is offering a six-month fixed-rate deal for 7 per cent, far more than you would earn from HBOS shares.</p>",
  "<p>As the recession hots up, will people stop buying music? Or will all the belt-tightening produce a bounce for pop, a relatively low-cost shot of pleasure in straitened times?</p> <p>Leeds's Kaiser Chiefs are taking a big punt on the latter reaction. A mere 18 months after their last record, they didn't really have to release an album into an autumn market already over-stocked with big beasts like Kings of Leon, Oasis, Keane, Snow Patrol, Killers and Razorlight. </p> <p>But they have, and they've raised their hemlines too - the ideal pop-cultural response to financial meltdown. Gone is the sackcloth of their second album, Yours Truly, Angry Mob. In its place is a metaphorical miniskirt. Off With Their Heads is at once insouciant, flirty - thanks to Mark Ronson's taut production - and very available; informed by the British Sixties and yet very now, with its references to Jamie's School Dinners and Hoxton scenester bar Dream Bags Jaguar Shoes.</p> <p>It's a shame that their lead single, 'Never Miss A Beat', didn't chart higher than five. Catchier than a norovirus, it cheers the attitude of 'the kids on the street' but boggles at a diet of crisps 'n' ignorance. Punching with equal weight is 'Can't Say What I Mean', a breathless treatise on ill communication. It takes in the stutters of infatuation, indie-rock's love of badges and a sly Bananarama nod ('It's not like I'm talking Italian...'). Songwriting drummer Nick Hodgson even ventures a bit of Yorkshire existentialism, 'The world and its crust are still drifting apart', beating The Streets's recent aper\u00e7us.</p> <p>Throughout, brass-mad producer Ronson keeps his trumpets in check. He does, however, have Lily Allen on speed-dial, faintly discernible on a couple of tracks. More notable is the encroachment of exotic punk-funk into the Kaisers' Britpop nouveau. It's a revolution in syncopation for this four-four band, fitting them with dancing shoes just in time for the party at the end of capitalism. </p> <p>A couple of forgettable tracks aside, Off With Their Heads is a tonic for tough times. The industry hunch is that this record will suffer in the scrum for the indie-rock pound, but we say: buy.</p>",
  "<p>The number of people losing their jobs is rising faster than at any time since the recession of the early 1990s. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, the total number of jobless is 1.8 million, rising by 164,000 in the three months to August, the most rapid increase since June 1991. Those claiming Jobseeker's Allowance rose by 31,800 over the past month, and it is being predicted that the number of unemployed could break the two million mark by Christmas.</p> <p>The number seeking advice after losing their jobs has 'massively shot up', according to employment law expert Kerry Underwood at St Albans-based firm Underwoods. 'We're three to four times as busy as this time last year.' He attributes the 'dramatic increase' to 'the bigger firms and institutions', but, he says, 'it's not just the banks: it is computer companies and office equipment manufacturers as well'.</p> <p>He points out that 'higher-paid executives tend to have reasonable periods of notice, reasonable payoffs and accept their fate'. But he says that, once recession bites, there is a 'second wave': 'That's when, for example, people receive a month's notice, not three, the payouts are lower and often they're the statutory minimum. At that stage in the downturn, financially speaking, life is a lot more difficult. My guess is that the real problems will start after Christmas.'</p> <p><strong>What should you do if you're told to clear your desk? </strong></p> <p>First of all, check your employment contract. 'Frequently, white-collar workers' contract provisions are more generous than statutory provisions,' advises Ann Jay, senior employment adviser at Cheshire Citizens Advice. 'However, if, for example, you work in a factory and are on a minimum wage, then that's often not the case.' </p> <p>You are entitled to be given notice based on how many years you have been working for the company - a week per year up to a maximum of 12 years. </p> <p>'What [then] comes as a rude awakening for people is just how low statutory redundancy payment is,' says Underwood. To qualify at all you have to have two years' service or more. The formula is half a week's pay for each year if you are between 18 and 21; one week's pay up to and including the age of 41; and thereafter 1.5 weeks pay subject to a maximum of 20 years. The statutory redundancy payment is capped at \u00a3330 a week, 'so the statutory maximum is \u00a39,900 and someone who is 40 with four years' service will get \u00a31,320,' Underwood says. 'That can be a nasty surprise, especially for the type of people who are coming in now from the financial services sector. They were earning big money.' </p> <p>Try to agree terms with your employer. 'Those in more senior roles may be able to negotiate a deal, particularly in the case of voluntary redundancy,' says Donna Bradshaw, financial planning strategist with the IFG Group. The maximum amount of redundancy that can be paid tax-free is \u00a330,000. 'Any amount above this is taxed at your highest rate,' she says.</p> <p>You could talk to your employer about using part of your severance pay (perhaps the balance over the first tax-free \u00a330,000) to boost your pension. You are also entitled to work out your notice, take 'gardening leave' or receive pay in lieu of notice - at the employer's discretion. </p> <p><strong>What legal rights do you have?</strong></p> <p>'It depends on how the redundancy is done,' says Suzanne McKie, chair of the Employment Lawyers' Association. If it is concluded by way of what is called a compromise agreement, such an arrangement precludes certain rights, specifically your right to bring a claim against your employer in a court or employment tribunal. </p> <p>Compromise agreements 'are where the employer gives an agreement to the employee to take to an independent legal adviser to assess whether what is being offered financially is appropriate,' explains McKie. 'If the employee signs the agreement, he waives all employment rights going forward.' This is also an opportunity for you to take legal advice (usually at your employer's expense). </p> <p>Redundancies, other than where an entire company is being closed, tend to be announced by calling employees into a meeting where they are told they are in 'a pool of selection' - in other words, they are being considered for redundancy. </p> <p>'There are five main obligations on employers,' says Russell Brimelow, an employment partner at Lewis Silkin. 'First, they need to be able to show that it is a genuine redundancy: essentially, that you are losing roles for staff - for example, when you are closing offices.'</p> <p>Secondly, if you are one of the selected 'pool', then the employer's selection must be objective and fair. You should be told what the selection criteria are and it is usually a points-based system. 'Most criteria are acceptable as long as they fall within a band of what's considered \"reasonable\",' says McKie. Common criteria include, for example, 'last in, first out' (though, such a policy can fall foul of age and sex discrimination rules); disciplinary history; or performance in the job. You can ask to see your points score (though not your colleagues') and use this in any negotiations over your final severance package. </p> <p>The third obligation, Brimelow explains, is to consult properly. Where there are large-scale dismissals, or collective redundancies involving 20 or more employees being made redundant within a 90-day period, your union or employee representatives should be consulted. </p> <p>'The legal obligation for the employer is not to have made their mind up about redundancy until they have consulted with people,' says Brimelow. 'The objective under law is to make sure no stone is left unturned before making such a critical judgment.' </p> <p>The next obligation is to actively consider redeployment. 'Alternative employment has to be suitable both objectively and subjectively,' explains Underwood. 'Suppose somebody moves you to a comparable job two miles away. If your place of work was originally 400 yards away from where you picked up the children from school that could be objectively reasonable and subjectively unreasonable.' </p> <p>According to Brimelow, the final obligation is that the dismissal procedure is conducted according to statute. If employers don't stick to the letter of the law, they could lay themselves open to an unfair dismissal claim. You could then take your claim to an employment tribunal.</p> <p>There is no legal aid to pay for a lawyer to represent you before a tribunal, though you can contact your union, local Citizens Advice bureau or law centre for free advice. Increasingly, lawyers will represent you on a 'no win, no fee' basis - but for a price. They take a percentage cut (often 30 per cent plus VAT) of any payout. </p> <p>But, as Citizens Advice's Ann Jay points out: 'Don't be afraid of the employment tribunal. Sit down and work out what you think you are entitled to. You do not have to work it out exactly; as long as the tribunal knows how long you have worked and how old you are, they can work it out.'</p>",
  "<p>A number of homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments are still being treated unfairly by banks, according to debt advisers. </p> <p>Last week the Treasury said one of the conditions of its \u00a337bn bail-out would be more help for those struggling with mortgage payments to keep them in their homes. All the debt charities The Observer spoke to welcome the condition, but some say they have seen no change in banks' behaviour since the government called for lenders to be lenient on those in arrears a few months ago. </p> <p>'If anything, some lenders are becoming more aggressive,' says Jahanara Hussein, an adviser at Capitalise, a London-based debt advice service. </p> <p>But while they welcomed the Treasury statement, none of the advisers, the mortgage industry or indeed the Treasury were clear on what 'more help' from lenders entails.</p> <p>'We are already working with the government to implement new measures to help those in arrears,' says a spokeswoman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'We don't know whether it [the Treasury] has anything extra in mind.'</p> <p>These measures, to be implemented in January, will include the option for homeowners to sell their homes to a local authority and rent them back. Another option is for them to sell a stake in their property in a 'shared ownership', letting them to continue to live there. But these options will only be available to a limited number of people in specific circumstances, including, for example, if they have children still in the family home. </p> <p>These are some options debt counsellors say the Treasury should consider imposing on lenders, and what you can do in the meantime. </p> <p><strong>Mandatory debt advice</strong></p> <p>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) is writing to the head of the Council of Mortgage Lenders because it would like to see more lenders referring people in difficulties straight to charity debt counsellors. The CCCS already has this in place with GE Home Lending, a sub-prime lender: if its borrowers are three months or more in arrears, they are referred directly to the CCCS, which will work out a repayment plan. </p> <p>'Even when people talk to their lenders, the lender and borrower will often agree to what is an unrealistic repayment plan,' says Frances Walker of the CCCS.</p> <p>Hussein agrees. 'Lenders should make it part of corporate policy that those who fall into arrears are phoned and given the names and numbers of local debt advice agencies,' she says. 'The chief executives of these banks make noises about how much their organisation is doing to help, but at branch level it is a different story.' </p> <p><strong>What you should do:</strong> As soon as you fall behind on your mortgage, contact your lender but also get in touch with Citizens Advice, the CCCS, National Debtline, or the Bankruptcy Advisory Service. </p> <p><strong>Lenders should allow arrears to be paid back over a longer period, stop adding arrears charges to the debt and consider mortgage interest holidays</strong></p> <p>'Lenders can consider these as options, but in most cases they don't,' says Hussein. Walker agrees. 'We'd like to see a bit more balance in arrears, perhaps allowing people to pay these back over 30 months rather than the 12 sometimes permitted by lenders now.' </p> <p><strong>What you should do:</strong> Financial Services Authority guidelines to lenders say that arrears-handling staff should offer customers options that allow them to stay in their homes, including making an arrangement to repay arrears over an 'appropriate' period. Whereas some may have been reluctant to allow this, Walker says now is a good time to ask your lender about it. 'We have found that certain lenders are recognising that there is no point in repossessing in the current housing market and are more flexible over other options,' she says. </p> <p><strong>Lenders should not be so quick to send those in arrears to court</strong></p> <p>Debt charities say that, despite government calls for lenders to be more lenient, some are still too quick to take the court route. 'In a recent survey we found examples of good practice, with lenders giving borrowers more time and space when they are struggling,' says Peter Tutton of Citizens Advice. 'But some lenders are still taking court action very quickly and being difficult in negotiation. In fact, there has been a very sharp growth in lenders taking court action and we would like to see them disincentivised from doing that.'</p> <p><strong>What you should do:</strong> Don't ignore a court summons. Get in touch with one of the debt counselling services as soon as possible or contact Community Legal Advice on 0845 345 4345. If you haven't got time for that, check if the court you are attending has an advice service - called a 'housing duty scheme' - that can help you on the day. You should not go into or negotiate with your lender outside court without an adviser helping you.</p> <h2>Angry with HBOS</h2> <p>One of the three banks receiving part of the \u00a337bn government bail-out is HBOS, which has outraged one of its former customers who has just had his home repossessed by the bank. Paul Hind, 52, from east Yorkshire, who was a successful businessman, ran into difficulties with the mortgage payments on his home after he bought a second business. It became apparent that the previous owner had falsified accounts and this led to the demise of the enterprise, eventually pushing Paul into bankruptcy. </p> <p>'I couldn't pay the mortgage because I was trying to meet staff costs and fell into arrears,' he says. 'I went into a Halifax branch to discuss a repayment plan, but when they rang head office the person there said they couldn't discuss the matter until the arrears had been cleared.'</p> <p>Paul and his wife decided to put the property on the market at around \u00a3400,000. The Bankruptcy Advisory Service, working on behalf of the couple, says it contacted HBOS to see if it would accept reduced monthly payments of \u00a31,000 until the property sold. The offer was refused, say the BAS, and HBOS sought an order for possession and sale. The house is now back on the market through HBOS at \u00a3260,000, around \u00a370,000 less than the couple owes.</p> <p>'The bank will now come for the arrears, which will push my wife into bankruptcy,' says Paul. 'The government is using public funds to prop up HBOS while it is apparently allowing properties to be sold at knock-down prices. The UK taxpayer is putting money in at one end only to have the banks' continuing bad practices lose it at the other.'</p> <p>HBOS, however, maintains it has 'shown great forbearance'. 'Just over a year ago, we agreed that the customers could pay a reduced amount of \u00a31,000 a month to ensure they could stay in the property,' says a spokeswoman. 'But this was maintained for only three months and no payments have been received since then.</p> <p>'We are aware that the property was valued at a fraction under \u00a3400,000. However, the original selling agent was not able to secure a sale at this price. Our valuation is a market valuation we are satisfied is fair. Even at this reduced price, we have had no offers. If the property was undervalued, we would expect offers to be forthcoming.'</p> <p>\u2022 Citizens Advice, <a href=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk\">citizensadvice.org.uk</a> or check your phone directory to find a local bureau; CCCS, 0800 138 1111; National Debtline, 0808 808 4000; Bankruptcy Advisory Service, 01423 799141/799142</p>",
  "<p>Five months into the job, Boris Johnson has already made his mark as Mayor of London by getting rid of the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair. It is about time people started addressing him as Mr Mayor - he has earned it. But apparently nobody does - the young, eager-beaver staff at City Hall call him Boris, just as they called Ken Livingstone Ken. For such an incredibly important job, the mayoralty carries few if any trappings of power - no official car (Boris cycles to work), no official residence, no chain of office, no mayor's banquet, hardly even an expense account.</p> <p>Boris of course is 'running late', so I chat to a nice young press officer about how City Hall has changed since Livingstone's day. 'It's more open,' he says. Apparently it used to be divided into cubicles, but one of Boris's first acts was to have all the partitions knocked down to make it open plan. His own office is still separate but, according to the press officer, Boris is very approachable. 'More so than Ken?' 'Probably, yes.'</p> <p>Boris eventually emerges only 10 minutes late and greets me as an old friend, though I haven't seen him since I interviewed him five years ago. I was hopelessly charmed by him on that occasion - and then subsequently uncharmed when I read of his affair with Petronella Wyatt. This time, almost the first thing I see on entering his office is a copy of Woodrow (father of Petronella) Wyatt's Journals lying on the coffee table. Does Boris have some death-wish desire to remind me of the scandal? </p> <p>The second thing I see is a man who looks exactly like Charles Moore, Boris's former editor at the Telegraph and predecessor at the Spectator, whom Boris introduces as his director of communications. Poor Charles Moore, I think, how embarrassing to work for a man who used to work for you. It is only when he speaks with a Welsh accent that I recognise him as Guto Hari, formerly of the BBC.</p> <p>Meanwhile Boris is flinging open cupboards and showing me the famous wine collection he inherited from Livingstone's day. 'It took me about a month to find it because I didn't open any of the cupboards.' It looks very enticing, but Boris says it's too early to crack open. He is drinking again, though? (He gave up alcohol for the whole mayoral campaign.) 'Oh God, yes. I did find it one of the most tedious things I've ever done. The only thing was it did help me lose weight a bit, but I soon made it up again with eating. I think giving up alcohol is cruel, cruel, one of the cruellest and most deceitful things you can do to your body. I've taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me. It's a great gift of the gods, in my view.'</p> <p>Then it's over to the window to admire the view. 'Best view in London,' he says, 'absolutely fabulous, but you can't see it because you can't clean the windows. Well, you can, but it costs thousands of pounds, you have to get a cherrypicker. If you want to blame Norman Foster [who designed the building], do.' It is true that the windows are absolutely filthy - nevertheless it is still a great view, looking over Tower Bridge and the Tower of London.</p> <p>Boris is still whirling about in a flurry of displacement activity, but eventually Guto Hari and I, acting as a pair of sheepdogs, herd him to the table. I tell him that when I interviewed him five years ago he was trying to have his cake and eat it, to be an MP and edit the Spectator at the same time. 'Well, I still am! Let's not beat around the bush here. My policy on cake is still pro having it and pro eating it!' But actually, although he still writes a weekly column for the Telegraph, he now seems to have committed himself wholeheartedly to politics.</p> <p>He is, he says, thrilled to be mayor. 'It's the most wonderful job in British politics. Every day I wake up in a state of wonderment that I have been elected - obviously knowing that millions of other people wake up in a state of wonderment that I have been elected too! It is just brilliant fun, but also very hard. I realised that if you're going to make a difference you've got to work really flat out.' He works at least 12 hours a day, and says he has never worked harder in his life except for one period at Eton. 'When I was about 16 I worked ferociously hard for two terms and laid the foundations for all future activity - I thereafter never really did any academic work. But it's a bit like that now - I'm having to run pretty fast on my hamster wheel.' (Note the intellectual arrogance - two terms' work was enough to get him through A-levels and Oxford. According to his Oxford tutor, if he had done just a bit of work, he could easily have got a first. It didn't matter though - everyone accepts that he is brilliant.)</p> <p>Many of his friends, he says, were surprised he even wanted to be Mayor of London. He had a comfortable seat as MP for Henley; he was earning reportedly \u00a3250,000 from the Telegraph as well as extras like \u00a325,000 a show for Have I Got News For You. But his friends obviously underestimated his ambition. Has he lost any friends as a result?</p> <p>'Yeah. It's true that there's a whole lot of people I might have hung out with or had lunch with that I haven't seen much of for the past five months and I do feel bad about that.' He thought he would miss the House of Commons but he doesn't at all. 'That's the most amazing thing about coming here, that not for one second have I thought, \"Golly, I wish I was on my hind feet in the House of Commons\" - no way! Better to reign in heaven than serve in hell or whatever the quote is.' ('Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven', actually - Satan in Paradise Lost</p> <p>The first time he ever thought of being mayor was in about 1995 when he'd just come back from Brussels, where he was the Telegraph's EU correspondent, 'and I remember hearing someone on telly talking about having a Mayor of London and I thought \"Wow, that would be a wonderful job!\" And then, like so many things, it faded into the background. And then when Ken Livingstone was elected, like many people my age I was a bit of a Livingstone fan in those days. Obviously I particularly enjoyed it when he was sticking it so firmly up the Labour Party - I thought that was great.' </p> <p>But about three years ago someone in the Tory party suggested he might stand as mayor, and 'my natural vanity and competitive spirit was piqued, but again I just filed it away as something I might do one day. But then I got increasingly interested in doing it, and finally decided to go for it. But I don't think you could say the Tory party was beating a path to my door! They were trying all sorts of other people - Greg Dyke, Brian Paddick - I was by no means their first choice. But having exhausted all other options, they then decided that they would put their shirt on me.'</p> <p>At the time, I told him, I thought he was a sort of joke candidate.</p> <p>'Did you really? That's both fascinating and insulting! But that was my own feeling of insecurity, because it was quite a thing to go up against Ken. In a way it was like Apocalypse Now - there was this deeply revered fellow, the Marlon Brando character who'd been a colonel and done incredible things at a fantastically young age, but then he'd gone up river and holed up in his lair and allowed things to go to his head. So I felt like Captain Willard, sailing up the long river. But I approached him with that sort of feeling of reverence, at the sad obligation of having to dispatch him.' </p> <p>But he is still on surprisingly good terms with Livingstone and having dinner with him soon. Livingstone sometimes turns up at Mayor's Question Time, which Boris says is actually quite helpful, 'because this office has no constitutional opposition, so it's an important discipline to have someone who can say, \"Well, I would do it this way.\" And Ken is public-spirited enough to want to do that. He does genuinely love London.'</p> <p>Boris has definitely changed since his Spectator days. (Incidentally, he told me that, though he loved the Spectator, he thinks in retrospect he stayed there a year too long.) He said during the mayoral campaign that, in order for Londoners to take him seriously, he would have to learn to take himself more seriously, and he seems to have achieved it. He looks smarter for a start and uses less of the 'Cripes, Crikey' Just William mannerisms. I wondered if, at age 44, he was quite relieved to shed some of his buffoon image?</p> <p>'Yes. The terrible truth, Lynn, is that the buffoon stuff clings to you like a burr and I'm afraid there's only so much auto-lobotomy I can do! The inner buffoon has a way of emerging! But I think the truth is that people did recognise that I was extremely serious about the mayoralty. At the end of a pretty exhausting nine-month campaign - it really went on and on and on - the proposition that I wasn't going to take it seriously was tested more or less to destruction.'</p> <p>He has also managed to suppress some of his old desire to be liked and learnt to be more ruthless. 'You have to. And indeed you realise that there's a great selfishness in endlessly trying to be liked - it is terribly selfish. People elect you to do the tough things, because that's what you're there for. So yes. We had to reduce the London Development Agency considerably and lost about 93 people, and it's tough. And there will be things that I will have to do in the future which will also be tough. But to shirk them is selfish.' </p> <p>Whether getting rid of Sir Ian Blair counted as tough is debatable, but it certainly marked a bold annexation of power. Simon Jenkins called it the moment when the mayoralty came of age. Actually, we can almost presage the change in Boris from his novel, Seventy Two Virgins, published in 2004. ('Ohmigod,' says Boris when I mention it, 'you've read my novel? That's the most exciting thing I've heard for weeks.') The protagonist, Roger Barlow, is an MP, older and less intelligent than Boris, but similar in many respects. He is coolly observed throughout the novel by his American research assistant, Cameron, who finds him puzzling. She admires him in some ways - 'He worked prodigiously hard. He got things done' - but she looks in vain for 'a knuckle of principle in the opaque minestrone of his views' and keeps wondering what, if any, are his ideals, his values, his core beliefs. He seems to say one thing to one person, the opposite to another; he also often spoils what should be a serious speech by putting in throwaway jokes. The Cameron commentary in the novel is tantamount to a critique of the old buffoon Boris by the new serious Boris, and perhaps an insight into the self-analysis that led him to change.</p> <p>The novel also offers some insight into his views on women - always his weak point in my view. He has never been a friend to working women and there are plenty of digs at them in his columns. In the novel, Roger Barlow belatedly decides that he is going to work at his marriage. He makes a list of things he must do - pick up wet towels and put the electric toothbrush back on its stand; not fart under the duvet or leave half-eaten tins of tuna under the bed. Above all, he resolves, 'I'm going to start listening properly when she talks to me. I'm going to communicate. I'm going to stay awake after lights out, because it's always worth it in the end. I'm going to understand that the important thing is not to solve problems, but to discuss them. After 15 years, I'm going to get the point that marriage is not a final act; it's like a meeting of the European agricultural ministers, an endless negotiation of insolubles.' It doesn't sound too hopeful.</p> <p>According to his biographer and friend, Andrew Gimson, Boris has had no end of affairs, not just the two with Petronella Wyatt and Anna Fazackerley that made it to the tabloids. Gimson takes the line that, of course, we can't expect politicians to live like monks, ho ho, but I feel this is never a great selling point with women voters. Given that everyone agrees that Boris's wife, Marina (daughter of the late Charles Wheeler), is just about the nicest woman in the world, and also given that Boris's mother was made so unhappy by his father's philandering that she had a long and serious nervous breakdown, you'd have thought Boris would have learnt to keep it in his trousers, or at least be very, very discreet. But, according to Gimson, he was always canoodling with women in the backs of taxis, and it was pure luck that no cabbie ever shopped him.</p> <p>One of the great quotes in Gimson's book, though unfortunately unattributed, is: 'As well as being a philanderer, he's a great family man.' I can see it might be true in an odd way, and asked Boris if it was. This brought on one of his yelping, snorting, hair-rummaging routines to give him time to devise his answer and eventually it came: 'I took a sort of vow ages ago that when bowled any kind of ball like that, the great thing to do is to watch it very carefully for as long as possible as it flies through the air, and then you stick your bat straight out, put your foot forward, block it and retire into your crease. That's the only way to deal with that one.' </p> <p>Right. So he doesn't want to take this opportunity to deny that he is a philanderer or to say that he is a reformed character? More yelps - and then the sturdy blocking of the ball. 'I'm not going to say anything except that I hugely admire the elegance with which you framed the question and the elaborate way that you dug the hole and placed the stakes at the bottom - but I'm not going to fall in!'</p> <p>There is a hand-written placard behind his desk saying, 'Boris for PM', which he quickly explains was not his doing but given him by the trade union Unite. But is Prime Minister now in his sights? 'This is a very, very wonderful, very difficult, very absorbing job and I know how lucky I am to have got it, and the thing to do is work very, very hard at it, and in the immortal words of Michael Heseltine, I cannot foresee the circumstances in which I would go for anything else.' But of course circumstances can change and he is ambitious enough, and perhaps now serious and ruthless enough to go all the way. If only he can learn to be safe in taxis.</p> <h2>The gaffes and the glory - a life of Johnson</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson June 1964, in New York.

  "<p>Apart from one tiny spot of grease on her pink jumper, you would never know that Anjum Anand, TV chef and cookbook writer, is halfway through cooking lunch for 13 guests - four of whom are celebrated chefs - as she ignores her fiercely sizzling pan of stuffed chillies to fasten her three-year-old daughter's wristwatch. She is still smiling as Mahi skitters off to play with her cousin Maia, and turns her attention back to her frying pan. In short, Anand, 36, is far from the sweaty, exasperated mess that most of us turn into the moment our dinner-party guests are out of sight. In spite of the collection of Michelin stars sitting in her living room, snacking on Quorn samosas and waiting for lunch, she is unfazed and virtually immaculate.</p> <p>'I was a bit nervous about cooking for such a lot of chefs,' she says, pushing chillies around the pan, 'but I thought they would probably enjoy some simple home cooking, nothing fancy, because it would be different for them, and it's less scary for me.' Consequently, today's lunch is Anand's take on traditional Punjabi dishes (her family is from the Punjab and her parents emigrated from Delhi to London some 45 years ago), but with her signature twist - which is to take Indian specialities and make them both simpler and lighter. The roomy top-floor flat she shares with her daughter and husband is in Belsize Park, north London, but she got the lunch ingredients from West Hendon, about 25 minutes away. 'There is one road of Indian shops where I always go, because I know they do the freshest raw ingredients. I do my \"Indian shop\" there once a week. But I get my spices from India - my mother-in-law, who stays every summer, brings them over for me: she'll check out what I've got and say, \"Your cumin is too weak\" or whatever, and get me fresh ones.'</p> <p>Her guests are having those little samosas to start with, accompanied by a fresh and zingy green chutney made with coriander and mint. Then there will be chickpea curry with bhatura, a puffed-up fried bread, or rice for anyone who is avoiding oil, spiced potatoes, crispy strips of deep-fried okra and stuffed chillies with a calming yoghurt sauce flavoured with cumin seeds. There's also a salad of tomato, cucumber, red onion and coriander, topped with grated coconut. 'That's not traditional,' Anand points out. 'I'm making this in the south-Indian style.' Just before serving the salad she rustles up a dressing by quickly frying some cumin seeds, mustard seeds and curry leaves, which she tosses into the salad with the juice of a lemon. </p> <p>There is no meat or fish for lunch today, as Anand's husband (who is away) is a Jain, and so she never cooks meat in the house. 'I sometimes feel a little bit as though our guests suffer for his vegetarianism,' says Anand, 'so I made these Quorn samosas taste as much like keema [minced meat, usually lamb] as possible. One of the chefs actually did think they were meat!' </p> <p>Anand herself won't be eating much either. 'Twice a year there is a fast for nine days, which I have been doing since I was 16. A lot of women in India do it, although I only know four girls here who do. It coincides with Indian harvest time and it's for the Hindu goddess Durga. It means I will not eat any grains: no wheat, rice, lentils, chickpeas or anything that can be made into flour, and no onion or garlic, only root vegetables, fruit and yoghurt, and certainly no meat. So today I will just be eating the potatoes.' For Anand this is as much about having a detox as about religion: 'At home when I was growing up, this would be a time of prayer, which is not so much the case now, but none the less, it still feels like a very good thing to do.'</p> <p>As a teenager, Anand struggled with her weight, and it was this that led her to look at adapting the food she ate at home - in the end she lost over 30 kilos. 'I lived at home until I married four years ago, so in my early twenties, I went into my mother's kitchen and asked her lots of questions - why was she doing this or that, why do you use oil here or there?' The more she learnt, the more hooked she got, and so in order to figure out how to fit cooking into a career, she went to work in a hotel kitchen as a waitress, for a catering company and even in a fast-food restaurant, though her degree is in European business. </p> <p>'It's so much fun working in a team - I loved working in a restaurant environment - and it's what I miss most when I'm working alone, writing recipe books. But it was very hectic and I realised that to make it work I would have to give everything to the industry for years, and I wanted a family. When we got married my husband and I sat down and we realised that this kind of work wasn't going to be compatible with that.' </p> <p>Still determined to forge a career in food, Anand went straight to Books for Cooks, London's biggest dedicated cookery bookshop and asked them if they had any books on healthy Indian food, which they didn't. Next she researched the names of the publishing houses that produced cookbooks, and the editors who worked on them. </p> <p>'I even downloaded a sheet on how to write a book proposal off the internet.' Finally, her first book, Indian Every Day, was published in 2005. This got her noticed by the BBC, which gave Anand her own series last year, Indian Food Made Easy, and which was so successful that her next starts in November, along with a third book, Anjum's New Indian. Now, it's her mother who uses Anand's cookbooks.</p> <p>'Terrifyingly, they've just shown the last series in India,' she says, mixing a handful of pomegranate seeds into her homemade Indian lemonade (still water, lemon, sugar, mint and a touch of salt - a relic from the days when it was made for workers in the fields). </p> <p>'I really expected people to turn around and say, \"Who is this girl from London, who has never even lived in India, to tell us how to cook our food?\" but the reaction has been amazingly positive. I think that what is happening in India now is that a lot more women are working, and there simply isn't the time to cook elaborately. My recipes have just come at a good time because I'm not removing any of the flavours that they love, but I am making them easier to achieve. For example, I have a recipe for oven-fried chilli chicken, which is very easy and which I get emails from India asking for, but 40 years ago, most people in India didn't have ovens. Also, I've come at a good time as there are no young cooks on television in India.'</p> <p>At the dining table, everything is ready to be served up, and Anand is still showing no sign of nerves, despite the presence of Vineet Bhatia and his wife Rashima (of Michelin-starred Rasoi Vineet Bhatia in London), Alfred Prasad (head chef at Michelin-starred Tamarind) and his wife Sunita Panjabi, plus Mehernosh Mody (chef at La Porte des Indes) as well as award-winning chef Udit Sarkhel and Radhika Verma from Mango and Silk. They are joined by Anand's friends Angela and Meera, plus her husband's brother and his wife Nivedita who are visiting from Calcutta, and two in-laws. </p> <p>Conversation veers from the credit crunch, to the etymology of the word Parsi, to the advantages of cooking with pomegranate seeds. More or less the only point of agreement is that Anand's lunch is delicious, something she hears with a flicker of relief. Silence only falls again when the dishes are cleared and dessert appears - carrot and kheer, made with cardamom, cooked carrot and sweet, thickened milk. Then, suddenly, it's three o'clock and the chefs have to head back to their own kitchens, no doubt considerably less calm than Anjum Anand's.</p> <p><strong>Rich chickpea curry</strong></p> <p>A rich, spicy chickpea dish from the region of Punjab that is normally paired with a soft, fried flat bread called bhatura but naan works well, too. Serve with a raita or yoghurt. </p> <p>Serves 6</p> <p>4 tbs vegetable oil</p> <p>1\u00bd tsp cumin seeds</p> <p>1 tsp carom seeds</p> <p>1 medium onion, made into a fine paste with the help of a splash of water</p> <p>20g ginger, peeled, halved lengthways and half sliced into thin julienne</p> <p>3 fat cloves garlic, peeled</p> <p>3 medium tomatoes, quartered and pur\u00e9ed </p> <p>3 x 400g cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed</p> <p>\u00bd tsp red chilli powder</p> <p>2 tsp coriander powder</p> <p>salt to taste</p> <p>1 tsp garam masala</p> <p>\u00bd tsp dried pomegranate powder</p> <p>Heat the oil in a large non-stick saucepan. Add the cumin and carom seeds and once they have sizzled for 5 seconds add the ginger julienne and the onion paste. Cook until the onions have browned well, around 10-12 minutes, stir often once the moisture has reduced.</p> <p>Meanwhile pur\u00e9e the garlic and remaining ginger with a splash of water to a smooth paste. Pour this into the pan once the onions have cooked and cook until the moisture has reduced and the paste fries for 20-30 seconds. Add the pur\u00e9ed tomatoes, salt and all the spices. Bring to a boil then simmer, covered for 20 minutes or until the masala has completely reduced and the oil has been released. Add the chickpeas, stir well then add enough water to come close to the top level of the chickpeas. Bring to a boil, simmer for 5 minutes and serve. <br><strong><br>Fried spiced okra</strong></p> <p>Chaat masala is a blend of spices and is the key flavouring in this dish, but if you don't have any and prefer a simpler dish, give the recipe a go anyway as this is the best way to cook okra. They need to be cooked when you want to eat them as they do not reheat well.</p> <p>Serves 4-6</p> <p>400g okra, wiped clean with damp kitchen paper, topped and tailed</p> <p>4 tbs gram flour</p> <p>vegetable oil, for frying</p> <p>1 tsp chaat masala</p> <p>\u00bc tsp salt</p> <p>\u00bc tsp red chilli powder</p> <p>\u00bc tsp dried mango powder</p> <p>Slice the okra pieces lengthwise into quarters. Toss with the gram flour. Heat the oil to a moderate-high heat in a large saucepan. Add all or half the okra, depending on the size of your pan. Fry for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the okra becomes crispy, with some just turning a rich golden brown colour. Turn the okra onto a plate lined with kitchen paper to drain, then tip into a bowl with the chaat masala, salt, chilli and dried mango powder and toss together. Serve hot.</p> <p><strong>Carrot kheer</strong></p> <p>I'm not convinced that words alone will persuade you to try a chilled dessert of creamy, thickened milk with softened floating threads of sweet carrots . But in just the same way that carrot cake may seem initially unpalatable, the proof is in the tasting, so do give this a go.</p> <p>Serves 6</p> <p>1 litre full-fat milk</p> <p>250g carrots, peeled and grated</p> <p>3-4 tbs sugar</p> <p>good pinch of saffron strands</p> <p>-\u00bd tsp green cardamom seeds, powdered</p> <p>2 tbs pistachios, chopped</p> <p>2 tbs flaked almonds, toasted caramelised pine nuts, to serve</p> <p>Heat the milk in a wide, heavy-based saucepan, stirring and scraping the base with the spoon frequently to make sure the milk does not catch and burn. Keep cooking until it reduces by about one third - this takes about 25 minutes. </p> <p>Add the carrots and continue cooking for another 15-25 minutes or until they are soft and the milk is as thick as you like it - I like it quite thin but others like it quite thick; you will need to keep up the stirring though. Stir in the sugar, saffron and cardamom powder, cook for another 2 minutes and taste for sweetness. Chilling any food dulls its sweetness, so you may need to add a little more than you think. Cool and then place in the fridge, covered with clingfilm as milk absorbs flavours from other food in the fridge. When ready to eat, serve in bowls sprinkled with the nuts.</p> <p><strong>Stuffed jalape\u00f1o chillies in yoghurt</strong></p> <p>Most supermarkets sell these large, fat green chillies which are ideal for stuffing. If using jalape\u00f1os, try to find large ones as the stuffing takes away from the heat, as does the yoghurt. SERVES 4 </p> <p>8 large, fat green chillies</p> <p>1 medium-large potato, boiled, skin removed and mashed</p> <p>2 tbs vegetable oil, plus an extra 1 tsp</p> <p>1 tsp mustard seeds</p> <p>\u00be tsp cumin seeds</p> <p>\u00bd tsp large fennel seeds</p> <p>2-3 tbs water</p> <p>2\u00bd tbs desiccated coconut</p> <p>7 tbs yoghurt</p> <p>salt, to taste</p> <p>15 curry leaves</p> <p>for the stuffing:</p> <p>\u00bc tsp turmeric</p> <p>\u00bd tsp ground cumin </p> <p>\u00bd-1 tsp lemon juice, to taste</p> <p>1 tbs chopped onion, softened in 2tsp </p> <p>vegetable oil (optional)</p> <p>salt, to taste</p> <p>Blanch the chillies in boiling salted water for 2 minutes, then drain on kitchen paper. Slit the chillies on the straightest side to make a pocket. Scoop out the seeds and membranes and discard. Add the stuffing ingredients to the mashed potato and mix together well. Stuff the chillies with just enough mixture to fill. Heat 2 tbs of the oil in a large frying pan. Add \u00bd tsp each of the mustard and cumin seeds and, when they pop, add the fennel seeds. </p> <p>Cook for another 20 seconds, then add the chillies. Saut\u00e9 over a low heat, making sure they do not lose their shape, about 7-9 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk the water and coconut into the yoghurt and season. Heat the remaining oil in a small pan and add the remaining mustard and cumin seeds and the curry leaves. Cook for 20-30 seconds and stir into the yoghurt. Leave to cool while the chillies finish cooking. To serve, place the chillies on a plate and pour the yoghurt over. </p> <p>Anjum's New Indian (Quadrille, \u00a320) is out now.

  "<p>To a certain extent, the flavour of a good mince depends on careful seasoning. However, just as important is the browning of the meat. I make certain that when the mince goes in the pan that I leave it to sizzle for several minutes without stirring to give it a chance to brown. Getting the meat stickily golden at this point will make all the difference to the finished mince. </p> <h2>Rather good mince</h2> <p>Serves 4 (with potatoes, crisp polenta or pasta)</p> <p><strong>butter - 50g<br>cubed bacon - 70g<br>a medium onion<br>garlic - 2 fat cloves <br>celery - 2 stalks <br>mushrooms - about 100g<br>bay leaves - 2<br>minced beef or lamb - 400g<br>canned crushed tomatoes - 400g<br>stock - 200ml<br>a nutmeg</strong></p> <p>Melt the butter in a large, heavy-based pan then stir in the bacon and let it cook for five minutes or so, without colouring much. </p> <p>Meanwhile peel and finely chop the onion and garlic and stir it into the bacon, followed by the celery, finely chopped. Lastly, finely chop the mushrooms and add to the pan, then tuck in the bay leaves and leave to cook for 10 minutes over a moderate heat, stirring frequently.</p> <p>Turn up the heat and tip in the meat, breaking it up well with a fork. Now leave to colour without stirring for a good three or four minutes, then, as the meat on the bottom is starting to brown, stir again, breaking up the meat where necessary and leave to colour.</p> <p>Mix in the tomatoes and stock and a grating of nutmeg, and some salt and black pepper, letting it come to the boil. Turn the heat down so that everything barely bubbles. There should be movement, but one that is gentle, not quite a simmer. Partially cover with a lid and leave to putter away for a good hour or so, stirring from time to time, regularly checking the liquid levels. Serve with pasta, potatoes or crisp polenta. </p> <h2>Peppers with mince, parmesan and rosemary</h2> <p>The thought of stuffed peppers usually makes my heart sink. But season the meat thoughtfully - in this case with rosemary, garlic and parmesan - and you have something worth eating. </p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>a large onion<br>olive oil - 2 tbs, and a little more<br>garlic - 2 cloves<br>rosemary - 3 bushy sprigs<br>tomatoes - 2 large <br>minced pork - 350g <br>breadcrumbs - 50g<br>small red peppers - 6<br>grated parmesan</strong></p> <p>Set the oven at 200\u00baC/Gas 6. </p> <p>Peel and finely chop the onion, put it into a large, shallow pan with the oil over a moderate heat. Let the onion soften without colouring. Peel and slice the garlic, chop the leaves from the sprigs of rosemary and add to the onions. When all is soft and fragrant, chop the tomatoes and stir them in. Continue cooking until the tomatoes have collapsed into the sauce. Season with salt and black pepper, then stir in the minced pork and the breadcrumbs. Remove from the heat.</p> <p>Cut the peppers in half lengthways then lower them into a pan of boiling water for 6-8 minutes until they are slightly limp. Remove them with a draining spoon and put them skin-side down in a baking dish.</p> <p>Divide the pork mixture between the peppers then moisten with a little olive oil. Scatter grated parmesan over the peppers and bake for 35 minutes till sizzling. </p> <h2>Meatloaf with porcini and bacon</h2> <p>A meatloaf that keeps its shape neatly is likely to be less than interesting to eat. The recipe here is moist, coarse-textured and thoughtfully seasoned, and crumbles deliciously when cut. Rather than a sauce, I ate it last weekend with a side dish of baked figs. </p> <p>Serves 4</p> <p><strong>white bread - 70g<br>milk<br>dried porcini mushrooms - 25g<br>leeks - 2 medium-sized<br>butter - 30g<br>chopped parsley - a small handful<br>ground beef - 400g<br>smoked bacon - 75g<br>garlic - 2 cloves, diced<br>grated parmesan - a handful</strong></p> <p>You will need a loaf tin or terrine approximately 10 x 12cm and a sheet of greaseproof paper. </p> <p>Set the oven at 200\u00baC/Gas 6. Tear the bread into rough chunks and put into a dish with enough milk to cover. Leave till the bread is thoroughly saturated with milk. Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and cover them with warm water. </p> <p>Slice the leeks in half lengthways and then into small dice. Wash thoroughly in a colander with cold, running water. </p> <p>Melt the butter in a deep pan, then add the leeks and the chopped parsley. Leave them to soften over a low heat. The leeks should not colour. I prevent them browning by placing a disc of greaseproof paper over the leeks, so that they partially steam.</p> <p>Remove the leeks from the heat, add the beef and the bacon, diced into small pieces. Leave the meat to brown nicely on the underside before stirring. Add the chopped garlic and the mushrooms, drained of their soaking liquid and roughly chopped. Wring out the breadcrumbs and stir into the mixture with plenty of salt and pepper and the grated parmesan. </p> <p>Push the meat into the lined tin and smooth the top flat. Fold the paper over the top and place the tin in a roasting tin. Pour hot water into the tin, to come halfway up the meatloaf. Place the roasting tin in the oven, and leave for an hour until fully cooked through. </p> <p>Leave to settle for 10 minutes before turning out and carefully slicing. </p> <h2>Pork patties with thyme and mozzarella </h2> <p>We tend to think of burgers as being made with minced beef, but pork is an excellent mince, too, offering plenty of succulence. </p> <p>The mozzarella is an unusual addition, and oozes seductively as you eat. </p> <p>Serves 3-4</p> <p><strong>spring onions - 4<br>garlic - 2 cloves<br>butter - a thick slice or 25g<br>cubed pancetta - 100g<br>thyme - 4 bushy sprigs<br>minced pork- 350g<br>the grated zest of half a lemon<br>mozzarella - 1 ball</strong></p> <p>Chop the onions and peeled cloves of garlic finely then let them soften and colour lightly in the butter over a moderate heat. Add the cubed pancetta. Strip the thyme leaves from their stalks, chop them finely then add them to onions, letting them cook for a few minutes until coloured. Let the mixture cool a little.</p> <p>Mix the minced pork into the onion, add the grated lemon and season it generously with black pepper and salt. Cut the mozzarella into cubes and stir it into the mixture. </p> <p>Shape the mixture into six little burgers each about the size of a digestive biscuit, and leave to settle for half an hour. </p> <p>Get a non-stick frying pan hot. Brown the patties on both sides, then leave them to cook through to the middle, a matter of eight to 10 minutes. </p> <p>Serve with thick slices of lemon. </p> <h2>Stir-fried lamb with broccoli</h2> <p>A thin steel wok is ideal for this because the fierce heat will help to caramelise the sugars in the meat, but you could use a frying pan, too. The sweet taste of the meat contrasts nicely here with the hot sour notes of the seasonings. </p> <p>Serves 2</p> <p><strong>broccoli - a large handful of florets<br>spring onions - 3<br>garlic - 3 plump cloves<br>hot red chillies - 2<br>groundnut oil- 3 tbs <br>minced lamb - 300g <br>a lime<br>nam pla (Thai fish sauce) - 1 tbs<br>sugar - a tsp<br>coriander leaves - a small handful</strong></p> <p>Blanch the florets of broccoli for one minute in boiling water. Drain and set aside. Chop the spring onion, removing the darkest green leaves as you go. Peel the garlic and chop it finely, then seed and chop the chillies. Get the oil really hot in a shallow pan then cook the onions and chillies until soft but not coloured, moving them quickly round the pan as you go. It will appear there is too much oil, but bear with me. </p> <p>Add the minced lamb, let it colour appetisingly. It should go a rich golden colour. Add the drained broccoli. In a small bowl mix the juice of the lime with the nam pla and sugar. Tip into the hot pan, leave to sizzle briefly scraping at the gooey stickings on the bottom of the pan and stirring them in as you go. Check the seasoning - you may need a little salt - and stir in the coriander.</p>",
  "<h2>Royal Navy is not acting on its own </h2> <p>One would think that nothing had been done in the Indian Ocean until the Royal Navy frigate Northumberland intervened ('Navy to tackle Gulf pirates', News, last week). For at least two years, many ships from many navies have been maintaining a strict surveillance of these maritime roads as part of the US-led operation Enduring Freedom.</p> <p>As far as I know, the only two operations against piracy have been led by the French Navy to recover two sailing ships, Le Ponant and Le Carr\u00e9 d'As. Now there is the case of the Faina, a transport ship with a strange cargo of tanks and ammunition whose destination is unknown. The ship is under surveillance by ships from the US, France, Russia and Malaysia. So I wish Northumberland the best (with the help of ships from other navies).<br><strong>Rear-Admiral (Rtd) (FN) Jean Lacaille</strong><br>Boulogne-Billancourt, France </p> <h2>Writers don't need bandwagons </h2> <p>Shami Chakrabarti is wrong to claim that no writer approached to join Liberty's campaign against the 42-day detention proposal turned down the opportunity (News, last week). I certainly did. It is not because I favour detention without trial, but because I don't need a ride on a bandwagon.<br><strong>Hilary Mantel</strong><br>Woking, Surrey </p> <h2>Let's hear it for libraries</h2> <p>Victoria Coren (7 Days, last week) is right to point out that education is vital in troubled times. Never has the need for libraries and books been more important. Yet, as I read her thoughts on Andy Burnham's claim that greater funding of libraries in the present climate is unrealistic, I couldn't help but feel sympathy for the minister. With a potential \u00a3500bn being spent on saving the money-sucking vampires of the City, the coffers are going to be depleted and some cuts in spending will become necessary.</p> <p>But then I turned to Pendennis and discovered the Department for Work and Pensions spent \u00a32m on taxis last year. Is it any wonder that the hundreds of people I talk to in schools think our politicians are lying hypocrites?<br><strong>Bali Rai</strong>, children's author <br>Leicester </p> <h2>It is my right to choose death</h2> <p>The opposition to assisted suicide by 94 per cent of palliative care physicians claimed by Dr David Jeffrey (Letters, last week) can hardly be regarded as disinterested in view of the negative effect it would have on their business. Palliative care does not eliminate pain. Patients who are unconscious for long periods are unaware of these blank periods. For them the conscious periods meld into one long sequence of suffering. I have heard, and heard of, such patients expressing the fervent wish for it to be all over.</p> <p>As an octogenarian, I will face the dilemma - should I develop a terminal condition - of whether to terminate my life while I can still do it unaided or of hanging on too long and risking palliative prolongation. The availability of assisted suicide would be a great comfort to me; its denial is an abuse of the human right to choose. <br><strong>Alexander Woods</strong><br>Liverpool </p> <h2>Getting to the roots of history</h2> <p>Vanessa Thorpe ('Agincourt wins battle of bestsellers', News, last week) ignores the fact that historical fiction often has a more pressing agenda than merely boosting the popularity of prominent individuals. The genre has also been used to rewrite the past of those excluded from traditional historical narratives where documentary evidence is simply nonexistent. Alex Haley's Roots is a good case in point.<br><strong>Dr Emily West </strong><br>Department of History, Reading University</p> <h2>No shame in liking Shameless</h2> <p>Nick Cohen's rant against Shameless ('History shows how poverty helps the right', Comment, last week) is starting to grate the more I hear the same argument from the left.</p> <p>Shameless has nothing in common with Little Britain or The Jeremy Kyle Show. It was created by Paul Abbott, who based it on his experiences of growing up in Burnley. It's a true account of how most under-class people, myself included, exist. It won a Bafta and is shown in nine countries. So, when Cohen says 'if you haven't seen it, you haven't missed much', he must believe the show's target audience doesn't read your quality paper. </p> <p>From my experience, the under-classes lap it up. And we do so because it's real; we connect with it. I don't want to watch misery in the form of Cathy Come Home. I want to watch shows like Shameless. Shows that make me laugh. It's television made for us; it's not mocking us, it's us antagonising the other classes and authority. <br><strong>Damien Kelly</strong><br>Dublin </p> <h2>Review was culturally bigoted </h2> <p>Jay Rayner's review of Oki-Nami (OM, 28 September) has left us deeply upset. Rayner writes: 'The chef's name is Mike Dodd. Here, of course, we confront those uncomfortable questions about whether it is possible to cook well outside your own culinary tradition.'</p> <p>It is a narrow-minded assumption that someone with an English-sounding name cannot come from another country. I was born in a small village on the west coast of Japan. My mother, Michiko Mitsuishi, is Japanese and she met my father, Jeremy Dodd, when he was working on the rebuilding of Japan just after the Second World War.</p> <p>On the wider point, to say that someone from another country or culture cannot be good at cooking or representing a country other than their own is bigoted. The proprietor and executive head chef of Zuma, probably the best Japanese restaurant in the UK, is German.<br><strong>Mike Dodd</strong>, <br>owner and head chef Oki-Nami <br>Brighton </p> <h2>BBC blogs are in good hands</h2> <p>I would like to assure Peter Preston ('Danger lurks for BBC's bloggers', Media, last week) that the blogs of BBC journalists do in fact have editorial oversight. Those systems apply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That oversight applies to all the BBC's output, regardless of whether it is TV, radio, online or a blog.</p> <p>Of course no one can guarantee that in the future errors might not occur, but if they do, it will be despite the efforts of individual journalists and editors, not because of a lack of oversight. BBC blogs are an important way of providing additional information and insight to the public and our audiences greatly value them. <br><strong>Helen Boaden </strong><br>director of BBC News<br>BBC Television Centre, London W1</p> <h2>The Miller's tale</h2> <p>Kate Kellaway's review of Luisa Dillner's The Complete Book of Mothers-in-Law (Review, last week) relates to the post-dinner remark by Arthur Miller's mother that Marilyn Monroe was a 'sweet' girl but that it was a pity she 'pissed like a horse'. Perhaps it was hearing of this verdict that led Marilyn, at another of her mother-in-law's dinners, to look up from her plate of matzoh balls and inquire, again sweetly: 'So, Mrs Miller, what do they do with the rest of the matzoh?'<br><strong>Liam Stenson</strong><br>Galway, Ireland</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p><strong>What she watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice</strong>, C4</p> <p><strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall</strong>, C4</p> <p><strong>Wired</strong>, ITV1</p> <p>I'd always thought of Peter Kay as more of a nod-and-a-winker than an arch-satirist but with last Sunday's <strong>Britain's Got the Pop Factor and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice</strong> (C4's biggest audience of the year at 5.5 million), he's probably now situated somewhere in the satirical pantheon between Alexander Pope and Chris Morris.</p> <p>Admittedly, Reality TV talent shows are easy to have a pop at but this really was pitch-perfect, and made me - oh yes - laugh out loud, which hurt because I've got a sore throat and sinuses like favela drains, but hey, it was such an amazing journey</p> <p>'The journey' is to reality TV what 'the naughty step' is to Supernanny, 'fuck' is to Gordon Ramsay and 'credit crunch' is to Robert Peston, with no reality contestant allowed to escape its gruelling demands. Even if they turn up at the auditions theoretically to sing, most wannabes are sufficiently clued-up to bring (along with the Thermos and sandwiches) a bit of a back-story. </p> <p>This is not so much about impressing the judges as wowing the producers, who care considerably less about singing than they do about wringing every last viewer dry of tears.</p> <p>Thus Peter Kay gave us R Wayne (Our Wayne), who was evicted from bootcamp for not being interesting enough but immediately reinstated by Pete Waterman on compassionate grounds when Wayne's grandmother had a heart attack on hearing he'd been dumped from the show. Perfect. As were the almost uncannily plausible 2 Up, 2 Down, a group comprised of two couples, with both the women in wheelchairs.</p> <p>The auditions were fantastic: 'Two dwarves, two donkeys - it's like a Saturday night at Simon Cowell's,' deadpanned judge Dr Fox, thus going some way towards rehabilitating himself several years after famously declaring that 'paedophiles have more genes in common with crabs than they do with you or me ...' on Chris Morris's Brass Eye</p> <p>But the best bits were the finalists' absurd medleys - particularly Peter Kay-as-Geraldine's priceless segue from Springsteen's 'Born to Run' to 'Born Free' to 'Free Nelson Mandela' to Rihanna's 'Umbrella' (ella-ella-ella) - while the sight of Paul McCartney 'mentoring' Geraldine's renditions of TV themes, suggesting Home and Away might be preferable to Blankety Blank ('Paul had his heart set on something more romantic') was priceless, clearing my sinuses faster than Sudafed.</p> <p>The last time I cared about the charts was in about 1988 but I very much hope Geraldine's 'Winners Song' - a gloriously anodyne ballad, all the better for having been written by Gary Barlow - beats Leon to the number one spot this week, if only for the sake of the poor crippled pole-dancers.</p> <p>And thank you, Channel 4, for being kind enough to give us televisual yin and yang in the same week. After Britain's Got the Pop Factor, watching <strong>The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall</strong> made a bizarrely beautiful double-bill. I laughed, then I cried, then I craughed.</p> <p>Gaza, 2003, and a young photo-journalism student on his first visit to the area is shot in the head while saving Palestinian children from Israeli fire. Cut to a busy house in London, where Thomas Hurndall's family, not knowing he was in Gaza, learn he is in a coma in an Israeli hospital after working with the International Solidarity Movement, a non-violent Palestinian protest group. This is a very British, stoical, middle-class family, not the sort to veg out on a sofa on Saturday nights, immersing themselves in the Battle of the Journeys. They are the kind who get on with stuff unfussily, keeping their emotions on the back-burner.</p> <p>Kerry Fox and Stephen Dillane, as Hurndall's divorced parents Jocelyn and Anthony, were stupendously good, sorting stuff out, quietly, efficiently, united in grief but dealing with it separately. For a drama-doc, there was a great deal more doc than drama; no histrionics, lots of facts and an even-handed attempt to humanise the Israeli-Arab Bedouin sniper who shot Hurndall and who, eventually - after the initial whitewash by the Israeli Defence Forces was thrown out in favour of an independent inquiry - received an eight year sentence for manslaughter. This didn't sound much until one learned that this was more than four times longer than any previous sentence for an equivalent crime.</p> <p>The power of the film lay in its resolutely low-key stoicism. Anthony Hurndall may have been emotionally uptight but that made it all the more moving when he unravelled. In front of his ex-wife and the limp body of his comatose son, he declared: 'When I heard the news, I thought, Tom, if you're gonna go, I couldn't think of a better way for you to go than in an act of great compassion, bravery and humanity. And I couldn't be more bloody proud of you.' His upper lip trembled, Jocelyn gave a small tight smile, and the moment passed. 'Gotta go back to the office,' he said, turning on his heel.</p> <p>The only concession to drama was a series of flashbacks to the day Hurndall left home for the Middle East against his mother's wishes. This was played out several times, in increasingly lengthy shots, so that by the end we knew they had parted uncomfortably, Jocelyn turning her back on her son, he slamming the door and thus missing hearing her final, pleading 'Tom'. This was a beautifully played start to the emotional journey every parent dreads. I shivered, then decided to bloody well not cry, all right?</p> <p>Happy days - at least professionally - for Jodie Whittaker, who, fresh from an appearance in Tess of D's, last week played both Thomas Hurndall's grieving sister, Sophie, and hapless Louise, who has been sucked into Laurence Fox's big bank fraud in ITV1's pacy, convoluted and timely three-parter <strong>Wired</strong>. Young Whittaker is good at looking scared, angry, embarrassed, nervous and any number of other actorly emotions but I'm afraid she's a bit rubbish at playing mum to her daughter, Erica. In episode one she didn't touch her, much less hug her, just shouted at her to go to bed, or told her to write down the registration of the car whose driver may or may not be about to abduct mummy. Most of the time Erica looked at Louise as she might at the babysitter who suggests staying up and doing a few vodka shots before watching something cool on TV, like, uh, Dexter</p> <p>If Louise gets out of this alive she may want to take a different approach to the maternal journey but meanwhile, bring on the fraud. Call me perverse but I'm in the mood for seeing a bank brought to its knees and begging for mercy, though I do hope Louise is forsaking an Isa and keeping her bung in readies, under the mattress.</p> <h2>The Palais<br>Memory Lane, W6</h2> <p>In desperation, I recently turned to Facebook to ask whether the Clash first played the Hammersmith Palais in 1979 or 1980 . I was there (it was great) but I couldn't recall the date, having discovered that the 'archive' of papery ephemera I've been carting around for nearly 30 years had mysteriously vaporised. The subsequent correspondence was entertaining but the question remained unanswered. </p> <p>Until last week and the repeat of BBC4's Last Man in Hammersmith Palais, in which Suggs narrated a charming history of the former skating rink with the first sprung dancefloor in Europe, visited by everybody from Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford to Charles and Diana, with the acme of glamour presumably being Elton's 50th birthday party in 1997. From Dixieland to dub, swing, disco and bhangra, the Palais - thanks in part to the Clash's 'White Man...' and Ian Dury's 'Reasons to Be Cheerful, Pt 3' ('Hammersmith Palais, the Bolshoi Ballet ...') - was, according to the film's talking heads, always more than just another venue, until it closed last year. Oh, and thanks to Mick Jones for finally answering the question: 1980, apparently - though I still need the exact date ...</p>",

  "<p>It must have been sometime in 1979, or maybe 1980, when I saw Freddie Toal on the evening news. I remember that I was sitting in the living room of a flat in Kensal Rise, north London with some friends, when someone shouted out his name and I looked up and there he was, bedraggled and barely recognisable; a lad from home. </p> <p>He was not someone I knew very well, but I distinctly remembered him from the early years of the Troubles when we had both been involved in the rioting that was part of daily life in the Nationalist areas of Armagh. Back then, Freddie Toal had longish black hair and wore the young, working class uniform of denim jacket and jeans. On the news that night, though, he was wearing only a blanket, and was standing in a cell in the Maze prison. His hair was long, his face gaunt and the walls around him were smeared with his own excrement. He looked familiar but utterly altered.</p> <p>'For a long time, when I was on the blanket, I had no real idea what I looked like,' he says, some 30 years later, his long hair now gone, his speech quiet and measured. 'The only time I ever saw my face was this one time when the screws were sweeping piss into our cells. The sun suddenly shone through the window and, for a few seconds, I saw my reflection in a pool of piss. It sounds funny but it took me a while to register it was me. I looked like a wild man.'</p> <p>In Steve McQueen's much anticipated film, Hunger, which opens at the end of the month, there is a scene that must surely have been based on that image: two young men, scared but defiant, standing in a shit-smeared cell. It is powerful but not nearly as haunting as the footage that inspired it. The film tells the story of Bobby Sands, the leader of the IRA hunger strike of 1981, and the most iconic Republican figure to emerge out of the Troubles. It does not tell the whole story though, ending instead at the moment of Sands's death. The nine men who followed his example are mentioned only in a footnote. The mass protest that attended their deaths is never alluded to, nor the murderous violence that occurred across the already beleaguered province at the time.</p> <p>Both Freddie Toal and his close friend, Sean McGerrigan, were in the Maze prison at the same time as Bobby Sands. Having seen the film, I wanted to hear their story. We arranged to meet in a community centre near the Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh, the town that we all grew up in and where, to varying degrees, we were politicised by the early years of the Troubles. I never graduated beyond the rioting stage, though, nor did I embrace hardcore Republicanism. I guess I was too interested in girls and rock music, and could not wait to leave Armagh. And, besides, I was scared of guns, and of those that wielded them. Back then, the Brits - and the RUC - were the enemy but I did not hate them enough to even think about killing them. Nor did I really believe in dying for Ireland; it just did not enter my mind.</p> <p>At that time, you only found out for certain who was 'involved' when they were 'lifted' by the British army in a dawn raid, or went 'on the run' across the border, or, in some cases, were shot dead while on what the IRA called 'active service'. Freddie Toal was 20 when he was arrested on a dawn raid in 1977. He was subsequently charged with, as he casually puts it, 'possession of rifles and carrying out some knee-cappings in the town'. Sean McGerrigan followed him into the H Blocks the following year. He was just 17 when he was 'lifted' from his family house in nearby Callan Street in 1978; he was subsequently charged with attempted murder and possession of firearms. </p> <p>In a way, his arrest was not that surprising. His brother, Peter McGerrigan, whom everyone knew by his nickname, Jake, was shot dead by a single bullet fired by a British soldier on the Windmill Hill housing estate in 1973. He was the first IRA volunteer to be killed by the British army in Armagh. He was just 18 years old. 'Jake McGerrigan was the year above me in school,' remembers Freddie Toal. 'He was the first of my generation to die fighting for Ireland. At his wake, I knew I had to avenge his death. The first thing I did was join the Fianna \u00c9ireann [Young IRA]. Before that, I just rioted and threw stones, but then I wanted the gun. If you had told me back then, at 17, what was ahead of me, I would not have believed you.'</p> <p>The blanket protest was already under way when he entered the H Blocks in January 1977, and he went straight on it. In 1976 the British government had decided to phase out special category status for convicted terrorists as part of a bigger process known as 'criminalisation'. Both Republican and Loyalist prisoners, who had until then been granted special category status, were now to be treated as common criminals. The protest began on 14 September 1976, when Kieran Nugent, the first IRA man to be convicted for terrorist offences under the new policy, reputedly said to a prison guard: 'If you want me to wear that uniform, you're going to have to nail it to my back.' He was given a blanket and escorted to his cell. Other IRA prisoners followed his example, and in 1978 the mass blanket protest turned into the dirty protest when IRA prisoners refused to leave their cells following another violent dispute, this time over a demand for extra towels in the communal washrooms. The prisoners' policy of non-cooperation meant that they were often confined for days on end in their tiny concrete cells with just a blanket, a mattress and a Bible. Refusing to wash or slop out, they began emptying their urine out over the floor and smearing their excrement on the walls.</p> <p>Another emotive scene in Hunger shows two prisoners sleeping on dirty mattresses while maggots wriggle in the mounds of rotting food and excrement that have been pushed into the corners. Was it, I ask Toal, who remained on the blanket for four years, really that bad? 'It was worse,' he says. 'For years afterwards I had nightmares about it. I'd wake up drenched in sweat, thinking I was back there.' </p> <p>Back then, the most vivid description of their conditions came from Cardinal O'Fiaich, the then-Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland, who visited the prison in 1978. 'I was shocked by the inhuman conditions prevailing in H Blocks 3, 4 and 5, where over 300 prisoners are incarcerated,' he said. 'One would hardly allow an animal to remain in such conditions let alone a human being.' O'Fiaich compared the H Blocks to 'the slums of Calcutta', adding: 'The stench and filth in some of the cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta around the walls, was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for fear of vomiting.'</p> <p>His public statement prompted a response from the Northern Ireland Office, which began: 'These criminals are totally responsible for the situation in which they find themselves. It is they who have been smearing excreta on the walls and pouring urine through the cell doors. It is they who by their actions are denying themselves the excellent modern facilities of the prison.' </p> <p>The conflicting tone and message of those two statements, the one emotive and outraged, the other detached and clinical, prefigured the coming battle of wills between Republicans and the British state. In the eyes of the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, the prisoners were simply murderers and gangsters and were to be treated accordingly. To the Nationalist population of Northern Ireland, who were becoming increasingly agitated about conditions inside the H Blocks, they were political prisoners standing up for a defining principle of Republicanism. To complicate matters further, word was filtering out of the Maze about the often violent ill treatment of the Republican Catholic prisoners by their mainly Loyalist Protestant prison officers.</p> <p>Toal and McGerrigan also talk quite calmly about the beatings they say they received 'on a regular basis' from their mainly Loyalist prison officers. They often occurred, they say, when they were being returned to their cells after Sunday Mass, or after a visit from someone on the outside.</p> <p>The IRA leadership inside the prison communicated with their counterparts on the outside through 'comms', tiny rolled up pieces of paper inscribed with minuscule writing that were secreted in prisoner's mouths, anuses, or underneath their foreskins. Toal describes how he was often 'grabbed by my hands and feet by four screws and spread over a mirror on the floor like a chicken, while a so-called medical officer officer stuck his fingers inside my ass.'</p> <p>Did they ever feel like giving in, abandoning their protest? 'What you have to understand was there was incredible camaraderie in there,' says McGerrigan. 'You always took strength from the fact that there were so many men on the protest. After a beating, the prisoners would often start singing Republican songs though the doors just to do the screws' heads in.' Toal concurs, though at times he has a haunted look when he talks about his experiences. 'It never entered my head to give up but I was always afraid of breaking under the beatings. You always had to be strong, not show weakness, keep your principles.'</p> <p>They tell me there were some 'decent screws' but that most of them were, as McGerrigan puts it, 'just plain sectarian'. One senior prison officer in the Maze at that time was a man called Paddy Joe Kerr, one of the few Catholics in the Northern Ireland Prison Service. He grew up close to where Sean McGerrigan did, and joined the prison service before the Troubles started. 'He had the power to stop the beatings but he never did,' says Toal. 'He was systemised against us,' adds McGerrigan. In 1985 Paddy Joe Kerr was shot dead by the IRA on the steps of Armagh cathedral as he and his young son were leaving Sunday Mass. </p> <p>By 1980 there were over 400 IRA prisoners on the blanket in the Maze and in Armagh women's prison. Their conditions and harsh treatment had now become a major focus of protest. More chillingly, the IRA had responded to the brutality inside the prison by targeting prison officers on the outside. By January of that year, 18 had been killed. As the dirty protest dragged on, and morale among the beleaguered prisoners began to waver, certain influential IRA men inside the H Blocks began to put pressure on the Army Council on the outside to be allowed to use the most extreme tactic of all: a hunger strike. </p> <p>The hunger striker has an almost mythological status in the annals of Irish Republicanism. Before 1981 the most celebrated hunger striker was Terence McSwiney, Lord Mayor of Cork, who died in Brixton prison in 1920 after 74 days. One part of his inaugural speech could just as easily have described the Republican mindset half a century later: 'The contest on our side is not one of rivalry or vengeance, but of endurance. It is not those who can inflict the most but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.' </p> <p>On 27 October 1980 the first IRA hunger strike inside the H Blocks began. It ended in confusion on 18 December in what the Irish writer and historian Tim Pat Coogan called 'a burst of prison poker, which the authorities at first believed they had won'. No lives were lost but Republican prisoners realised quickly that they had been outplayed, and that none of their demands for special category status had been met. In November the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, had spelt out the British government's stance: 'Let me make one point about the hunger strike in the Maze Prison. I want this to be utterly clear. There can be no political justification for murder or any other crime. The government will never concede political status to the hunger strikers or to any others convicted of a criminal offence in the province.' The stage was set for the second and final round of what would be a bloody and protracted battle, and one in which Thatcher would face someone even more intransigent than herself. </p> <p>Freddie Toal recalls the moment he met Bobby Sands. 'It was 18 December 1980, the day the first hunger strike ended. He came into our cell. I remember he was stroking his beard as he spoke and you could see by the look of him that he was shattered. There were screws behind him so he spoke in Irish. He just said \"Ni bhfuair faic\" (\"We got nothing\"). Then he told us that there was going to be another hunger strike, and this time it would be to the end. He said: \"I will lead it, and I will die.\" That was the last thing he said to us.'</p> <p>The second IRA hunger strike, which began on 1 March 1981, was planned by Sands to develop in ever more dramatic stages, one man following another to his death. Sands himself was the first to die after 66 days without food. By then he had become a British MP, having famously taken the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat on 9 April 1981. In death he became, for a time at least, an icon. An estimated 100,000 people attended his funeral in Belfast on 5 May, streets were named after him in Paris and Tehran, and according to Tim Pat Coogan: 'The French government offered the Dublin government two gestures of solidarity, which Dublin declined. One was to boycott the British royal wedding, the other that President Mitterrand attend Bobby Sands's funeral.' </p> <p>Another nine IRA prisoners would starve themselves to death before the hunger strike was called off in October 1981. In the tense seven months it lasted, violence in Northern Ireland reached a pitch that recalled the dark days of the early Seventies: 61 people died, over half of them civilians, including a girl of 11 hit by a plastic bullet; 30 members of the security forces were killed by the IRA.</p> <p>I went home to Armagh for a short family visit in the late summer of 1981, and I can still remember the mood of dread, anger and simmering violence that seemed to have taken hold of the place. In a bar frequented by middle-class Catholics, school teachers, doctors and the like, I heard a collective hiss of pure hatred turn into a tumult of abuse when Margaret Thatcher appeared on the television in the corner. There was a cheer when the bar manager reached up and switched channels. Thatcher, it seemed, had galvanised the Catholic middle classes into voting for Sinn F\u00e9in. They have continued to do so, in ever-increasing numbers, ever since. </p> <p>Before the hunger strike, Sands had collected the names of over 70 IRA men who were prepared to fast until death. I ask Toal and McGerrigan if either of them considered putting their names forward. 'No, never,' replies McGerrigan. Freddie Toal just shakes his head. </p> <p>The following day I travelled up to Belfast to meet a man who did volunteer for the IRA hunger strike. His name is Pat Sheehan. He spent 55 days without food, and was approaching death when the hunger strike was called off, mainly because of intervention from relatives of the starving men. Sheehan is currently, he says, 'self-employed', and lives in a well-off, middle-class neighbourhood on the outskirts of west Belfast. He has a degree in philosophy, obtained while in the Maze Prison. The night before, he had watched Hunger, and was eager to talk about what he called 'the weird mixture of feelings it brought up'. </p> <p>Did the film, I ask, chime with his experiences of the H Blocks at that time? 'Most of the time, it did. The camaraderie was missing, though. But everything else was pretty accurate, the conditions, the beatings, the grimness of the blocks. It brought it all back.' </p> <p>Sheehan was arrested in February 1978 and charged with causing an explosion in the centre of Belfast. He received a 15-year sentence and moved to the H Blocks in March 1979. 'You were given a blanket and you went down to your wing,' he says, smiling at the memory. 'I was feeling apprehensive, a bit scared, and half expecting a beating from the screws as a welcome. It seemed very quiet, then I heard someone shout in Irish, \"New man on the block!\" and all hell broke loose. There was cheering and shouting and men banging the pisspots on the doors. I thought, the morale is high, the lads aren't cowed. It was,' he says, grinning, 'like walking out on to Croke Park to play for your county in an All-Ireland Final.' </p> <p>Sheehan said he put his name down for both IRA hunger strikes 'without hesitation'. He agrees now that this was 'a brutal thing to do' to his family. 'Absolutely, absolutely,' he says, nodding, 'but the thing was, and this came across in the film, we were absolutely focused. You had to be. So that nothing could deflect you.'</p> <p>When his parents and his older sister came to visit him, he waited for the right moment to break the news to his father. Instead, his father broke some bad news to him. 'He hung back after the others left, and whispered to me that my sister had just been diagnosed with leukemia and given five years to live. Looking back on it now,' he says, quietly, 'it might seem very callous of me to have gone ahead with a hunger strike in those circumstances, to take that decision when they were going through this awful moment. But I had made up my mind. I could not let the other men down.' </p> <p>How did his family react to his decision? 'They were devastated. Absolutely devastated. I can still remember the look on their faces when I told them. It was a terrible thing to see.' He says that his father 'became politicised during the hunger strike even though he was anti-violence to the day he died'. </p> <p>Nine men had already died when Sheehan began his hunger strike, and the 10th, Mickey Devine, died soon afterwards. 'In a way, you couldn't let their deaths affect you too much. I wasn't surprised when Bobby [Sands] died because we all knew he was going to go the whole way. It was more the inevitability of it that was terrible, but we stayed strong because we had to.'</p> <p>Was there a moment during his own hunger strike when he had any doubts about his decision? He thinks for a moment. 'Well, I was going into uncharted territory, so of course I had some doubts. Would I be able to carry it through to the end? I was as sure as I could be but, strangely enough, as time went on and I grew weaker physically, I became stronger psychologically until there was no doubt in my mind. Day by day, I became more certain.'</p> <p>Sheehan talks with remarkably little emotion of what he went through in the 55 days he inched closer to death. He says the worst part was 'the terrible realisation that you were not just feeling sick but becoming seriously ill, your own body rebelling against you'. In the last few days of his ordeal, he says, he was 'still lucid and very, very calm' but could only 'see shadowy, ghostly figures coming in and out of the room'. One of them was a doctor, who told him that even if he ended his fast, he would be permanently damaged and, in fact, might not even live. </p> <p>He tells me proudly that he has 'no lasting effects' from the hunger strike, and, in fact, 'recovered remarkably quickly'. In this, he is the exception: other surviving hunger strikers have had severe problems, usually with their eyesight and kidney function. Sheehan was 'almost totally blind' and 'lapsing in and out of unconsciousness' when the hunger strike was called off. A priest had granted him absolution, given him Communion, and performed the Last Rites over his bed. </p> <p>Can he describe how it felt to be pulled back from the brink of death? He sighs and shakes his head. 'To be honest, I had mixed emotions. On a purely personal level, I was glad that I had survived, but on another level I have to say I felt somehow disappointed, especially as the days went by and I received medical attention and started to recover. I think I had what is called survivor's syndrome. I felt guilty, definitely, about the lads who had died, about their families. And, in terms of the bigger political picture, I felt that stopping the hunger strike would demoralise and undermine the whole struggle.' </p> <p>The year after the hunger strike ended was, according to Sheehan, 'the most demoralising time for Republican prisoners'. Both Toal and McGerrigan had said the same thing. The following year, though, the prisoners had achieved all their aims, and more besides. Segregated from their Loyalist counterparts, and wearing their own clothes, they effectively ran the prison. 'When I was brought into prison in 1990,' the Republican activist and author Danny Morrison told me recently, 'a prison officer asked me if I had everything I needed. Then he said goodnight to me in Irish. Mad!'</p> <p>Why then, one has to ask, did those 10 men die? In one way, as Steve McQueen remarked recently: 'It was as if the whole history of the Troubles, and of Britain's relationship to Ireland, was distilled in that moment. It came down to two opposing and immovable forces: Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Sands.' Morrison, who was an envoy between the Sinn F\u00e9in leadership and the prisoners in 1981, concurs. 'I remember saying to Bobby, Thatcher will not back down. I came away knowing that his mind was set, too, though. He knew what he had to do and how it would end.' </p> <p>'Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart', wrote WB Yeats in his poem, 'Easter, 1916', about the death by execution of Irish Republicanism's founding heroes, among them P\u00e1draig Pearse, whose belief in blood sacrifice and martyrdom seemed at the heart of the IRA hunger strike of 1981. In retrospect, though, the tumultuous events of that time and in particular the election of Bobby Sands, can be viewed as a pivotal moment in Republican thinking, when Pearse's dark ideology reached its terrible crescendo then finally faded. It was the moment when, to paraphrase Danny Morrison, belief in the ballot box began to replace belief in the bullet. Everything that has happened since, including the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn F\u00e9in members taking their places in the Northern Irish Assembly as democratically elected representatives, has emerged out of that terrible summer of 1981. </p> <p>'Things change very slowly,' says Sean McGerrigan, 'and not in the way you expect. People might say that those men died in vain, but they died as part of a greater struggle. There will be a United Ireland but not in the way we envisaged it happening years ago.' </p> <p>Freddie Toal nods his consent. 'It was inevitable what happened,' he says. 'The environment we grew up in politicised us, and the H Blocks politicised us even more deeply. And if you came though what we did on the H Blocks, you have a special bond with the other men who did the same. Maybe it's hard for you to relate to that, just as it is hard to understand why we had to take up the gun, or why someone would choose to starve themselves to death for a principle.' </p> <p>He is right, of course. I have not been through what they have been through. And, despite our shared upbringing, and all that has happened since, I still do not fully understand what drove them to take up the gun or fuelled their monumental endurance, their unshakeable certainty. Nor, though, can I understand why, whatever their reasons for being imprisoned, they were treated in captivity as if they were less than human. Perhaps that is the unanswered question that still echoes most loudly, and alarmingly, in our fragile democracy in these still troubled times. </p> <h2>The toll - Hunger's strike dead</h2> <p><strong>Bobby Sands, aged 27 </strong><br>1 March-5 May 1981 (66 days on strike)</p> <p><strong>Francis Hughes, 25 </strong><br>15 March-12 May (59 days)</p> <p><strong>Raymond McCreesh, 24</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Patsy O'Hara, 23</strong><br>22 March-21 May (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Joe McDonnell, 29</strong><br>9 May-8 July (61 days)</p> <p><strong>Martin Hurson, 24 </strong><br>28 May-13 July (46 days)</p> <p><strong>Kevin Lynch, 25</strong><br>23 May-1 August (71 days)</p> <p><strong>Kieran Doherty, 25</strong><br>22 May-2 August (73 days)</p> <p><strong>Thomas McElwee, 23</strong><br>8 June-8 August (62 days)</p> <p><strong>Michael Devine, 27</strong><br>22 June-20 August (60 days)</p> <h2>Northern Ireland - a history of protest</h2> <p><strong>1965</strong> The Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland meet for talks, a move which provokes tension among Unionists. </p> <p><strong>1966 </strong>Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) forms in response to the perceived revival of the IRA, on whom they declare war.</p> <p><strong>1968</strong> Protests by the newly formed Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) descend into violence with loyalists attacking demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>1969</strong> <strong>12 August</strong> Simmering tensions erupt during the Battle of the Bogside which sees violent confrontations in Londonderry between police and nationalists and lasts three days.

  "<p>Back in the Eighties, in the aftermath of the 'video nasties' scare, British censors would have taken a pair of gardening shears to this delightfully outr\u00e9 slice of rubbery horror fun. The subject matter alone (the 'vagina dentata' myth made flesh) would have given chief censor James Ferman palpitations. How times have changed!

While mounting a satirical assault upon the chaste vows of conservative American teens, Mitchell Lichtenstein (son of Whaam!-art legend Roy) reminds us that there was always more to gore cinema than just meat and two veg.

  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p><strong>Q</strong> In late November I am travelling to Australia. On the way out I have a five-hour stopover in Hong Kong. It seems a shame to be so close to such a city and not visit. Are there any specialist transit tours, or if I go into Hong Kong by myself, what should I see? I arrive at 6pm on a Friday night. <br><strong>Simon Weller, Taunton</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> You need six hours for any of the organised transit tours available from the airport, so you'll have to go for a DIY tour. Five hours in Hong Kong will leave you with around 90 minutes downtown once you've cleared customs and taken the 24-minute Airport Express journey each way. However, you may still decide that 90 minutes in Hong Kong is better than sitting in an airport.</p> <p>A return trip on the Airport Express (<a href=\"http://www.mtr.com.hk\">www.mtr.com.hk</a>) costs \u00a37.60 and trains run every 12 minutes. You can save time by getting off in Kowloon and taking a stroll along the waterfront. The views of Hong Kong Island are only matched when seen from the Star Ferry which links to the mainland. I'd suggest hopping on that ferry, then strolling up to nightlife district Lan Kwai Fong for a bite to eat. At Hong Kong Station you can catch the train back to the airport.</p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I want to travel from Durban, South Africa, to Mauritius in December/early January to visit relatives. I have been quoted a fare of \u00a3900 for the return flight of five hours' duration each way. This seems exorbitant, seeing as my return flight from the UK will cost \u00a3520. Is there any alternative?<br><strong>Dennis Roberts, Sheffield</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Trying to book point-to-point flights that start abroad like this can result in a hefty price quote in the UK. Travel agencies here will only have access to the 'full published fare', rather than any discounted fares that may be available in South Africa. Trying to travel at peak time - January is summer holiday time in South Africa - is adding to the cost. If you can, go earlier in December or in February. Even so, the \u00a3900 you've been quoted sounds excessive. Opodo (<a href=\"http://www.opodo.co.uk\">www.opodo.co.uk</a>) showed a fare of \u00a3434 leaving on 3 December and returning a week later, travelling with South African Airways and Air Mauritius. Go on the same dates in January and the fare is \u00a3722.70, and a month later costs \u00a3441.50. Even if you could find a boat heading this way it wouldn't be cheaper than \u00a3440.

In other cases, including special events, you can book as long in advance as a hotel is prepared to offer you rates for. A safe bet is to start trying to make bookings early next year.</p> <p>When you do book, you will find choice and better rates in Ludwigsvorstadt, near Hauptbanhof station, than the more central Altstadt. I'd suggest Hotel Eder (<a href=\"http://www.hotel-eder.de\">www.hotel-eder.de</a>), a traditional Bavarian pension with en-suite singles from \u00a337 and twins starting at \u00a348.

They booked return flights with Ryanair departing on Friday afternoon from Bournemouth. They checked in electronically and arrived at the gate in good time. On boarding my brother was told that he could not travel because the name on the ticket was 'Rob' and the name in his passport is 'Robert'. He was given 30 seconds to consider his options before he was escorted out of the building by the Ryanair supervisor. His friends felt that they could not leave him so they did not board either. All three lost out on the cost of their return tickets and accommodation. My brother and his party were all sober and behaving impeccably.</p> <p>I realise that Ryanair ask you to enter the name exactly as it appears on your passport. However, my brother and a friend with the same name have travelled under the name 'Rob' before with Ryanair. It seems that Ryanair were being unreasonable. Does Rob have genuine cause for complaint?<br><strong>Sarah Goss, by email</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> I'm afraid not. I've heard from plenty of travellers who have had a similar experience. I can't emphasise enough how important it is to ensure your ticket and passport match on any flight, especially Ryanair. If you pick up a discrepancy up to four hours before travelling, Ryanair allow you to change the name on the booking for \u00a380 - which isn't cheap but cheaper than a group of you not boarding. You can make this change online. Ryanair's (and many other airlines' and travel agencies') FAQs state that: 'Failure to present valid photo ID matching the names on your reservation will result in your being refused check-in without refund.'</p> <p>If you check in online the only time anyone will check this is at the point of boarding, by which time it is too late. It only adds to the annoyance that these rules are often applied inconsistently - though not normally by Ryanair.</p> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p>How I agree with Andy Darlington [Letters, last week] about seats reclined in your face on aircraft.

  "<p>Dashing down the King's Cross platform to catch her train with seconds to spare, Yvette Cooper arrives breathless but surprisingly cheerful for someone woken at 2am by a small child arriving at her bedside.</p> <p>But as the train rattles north towards her constituency, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is in sombre mood. She spent the school run mulling over David Cameron's speech breaking the truce with Labour, and thinks his biggest mistake was implying that the worst of the banking storm was over: 'That slight sense that we are through it now - actually, I just think you can't say that. It's the inter-connectedness. People still can't be sure precisely where all of the risks lie.'</p> <p>The sun shone on Gordon Brown last week as the world lauded his audacious banking bail-out. But now Labour shelters under a darkening sky, facing not only official confirmation that Britain is entering recession but, more hauntingly, a fear of the unknown. If an obscure Icelandic bank can drag British savers and businesses down when it fails, what other buried threats around the globe may even now be emerging?</p> <p>Britain is entering uncharted waters, where political certainties dissolve, plans are torn up overnight and conventional wisdom is rendered useless, leaving Brown and Cameron locked in ideological battle for control of a transformed landscape. Yet the result is a clearer choice for voters than they have known in over a decade as a gulf opens between Labour and the Tories almost overnight. Labour wants to borrow its way out of trouble: the Conservatives wants to reduce debt. Brown's clunking fist clamps down on bonuses: Cameron flirts with 'nudge politics', wanting to shift behaviour by example.</p> <p>Cooper praises 'the power of government' as the only force equal to banks worth more than the GDP of some small countries: Cameron believes a powerful state squashes individuals. Slowly, traditional instincts of left and right are reasserting themselves.</p> <p>'Politics becomes more important now - not in a partisan, point-scoring way but because the way in which you deal with the crisis does depend on your values. If you have got to respond quickly, you go with your core instinct,' says Cooper.</p> <p>'When your back's against the wall, Labour values become more important. The idea that you just leave people to sink or swim, that you abandon people to their fate in the way I think the Tories did to constituencies like mine in the Eighties, just feels so wrong and irresponsible and unfair when people are being hit by forces completely beyond their control.'</p> <p>Cameron, meanwhile, argues that classic Tory values of thrift and enterprise fit the new zeitgeist better. But both recognise that this is a battle of values, not economics: and the party bonding most plausibly with the overstretched couple who can't remortgage, the small business ruined when its overdraft is called in, or the father facing redundancy, wins.</p> <p>Hence Cooper, the mother of three who can talk approachably about how her neighbours manage tight budgets, is now being deployed as the human face of the credit crunch. For Labour strategists have identified an intriguing gender gap over the economy.</p> <p>Male voters need facts, figures and graphs in a crisis: women are quicker to fear for their jobs and homes, and to respond to human casualties. Men listen to Brown's lectures on the intricacies of short selling: women switch off unless he connects emotionally. And acknowledging female fears matters, because British women now make the majority of household spending decisions, from shopping at the supermarket to family holidays: when they stop buying, the retail economy hurts. We are likely to see much more of Cooper in the months to come.</p> <p>So has she ever known what it is like to be hard up and jobless? She hesitates before answering: 'I had one period of time when I was ill for a year and couldn't work for about 12 months. I just had to live on benefits for a period, and then could only work part-time for a while.' Virtually bedridden with ME, Cooper spent months watching soaps and worrying that life had passed her by, but insists she coped financially. 'It was manageable because I didn't have kids at the time. Often the big pressures are when people have to manage with a family.' Those pressures are now biting. And the first test looms of whether Labour's heartland voters will bite back.</p> <p>The area from the former mining villages of Cardenden and Markinch to the postwar new town that gives the Glenrothes parliamentary seat its name was once natural Labour territory. But nothing can now be taken for granted in the 6 November by-election. For weeks Labour has been resigned to losing: now, unexpectedly, comes a chink of hope. Lindsay Roy, Labour's candidate and the headteacher of Brown's old school in Kirkcaldy, believes the Prime Minister's stature has grown there because of, not despite, the economic crisis.</p> <p>'Somebody said to me that one reason they were changing from SNP to Labour is that they have money with HBOS and it's still in the bank,' says Roy, a 59-year-old grandfather who has worked the seat so hard he has lost a stone in weight. 'The implication was that if there had been an independent Scotland, perhaps the money would not have been there.'</p> <p>The omens are good enough for Brown to be planning a campaign visit: Roy says he is finding 'a lot of people who voted SNP for the first time in 2007, but now they are back with Labour'. Yet privately Labour staffers concede that last week's trump card - embarrassing SNP leader Alex Salmond for claiming Scotland could form an 'arc of prosperity' with virtually-bankrupted Iceland - has counted for little. Most voters in Glenrothes don't care about foreign policy, but about jobs.</p> <p>'One person said that it was all very fine that the bankers are getting bailed out, but it's time ordinary folk got some help,' says Peter Grant, the SNP candidate. 'They have all these billions of pounds to save the banks, but didn't step in with \u00a339m to save Farepak two years ago when a lot of people around here lost money and their children didn't have much of a Christmas. People haven't forgotten.'</p> <p>William Watson, a trained engineer who now runs Blueline Taxis in the town, agreed. 'I've seen nothing but manufacturing industries slamming the door in the face of the people; all the plants that gave people work have gone,' he explains. 'With the government bailing out the banks, I just don't know where the money is going to come from.'</p> <p>The Tories may in effect be out of the game in Glenrothes, which is a straight Labour-SNP fight, but nationally such concerns could present them with opportunities. At the height of the banking crisis, normal opposition politics had to be abandoned for decency's sake, and Cameron could not appear too sympathetic to the Tories' old friends in the City. Hence he and shadow Chancellor George Osborne decreed a period of 'consensus' with Labour, joining them in condemning extravagant City bonuses. But, to the alarm of many of his MPs, as a result they were blotted out of the media as Brown took credit for steadying the ship. The recovery in Brown's ratings caused barely disguised angst in the Tory high command.</p> <p>'If there is one thing the Cameron lot are terrified of, it is this sense that Brown is good in a crisis,' said one Tory MP. 'Yet by stepping back we let Brown be just that. We were nowhere.'</p> <p>As Tory frustration grew, Cameron and Osborne were savaged on the blogosphere for lacking policy and strategic touch. The ConservativeHome website carried a string of contributions complaining that the party leadership seemed dazzled in the headlights of a crisis for which it had no solutions. Andy Coulson, the head of communications, was said to be edgy about the lack of TV coverage for Cameron. The party says it has solid evidence that Cameron's ratings go up in direct proportion to the amount of airtime he has on prime-time TV - and he had not been on for days.</p> <p>The Tory tax-cutters came out to play too, arguing that the only way for a real Conservative party to react was to demand drastic spending and tax cuts to breathe some life back into the economy - rather than match Brown over tax and spend. Cameron's caution, they argued, was the last thing needed in the new economic world.</p> <p>Throughout the week, officials in Cameron's and Osborne's offices at the House of Commons worked late into the night to ensure that when their leader ended the truce with Brown on Thursday, with a speech in the City, the tone was right. Important ideological issues had to be finessed. How could the New Cameron Tories - who had never argued much for City regulation - now embrace it subtly without being accused of transparent opportunism? How could a party that had preached about the state staying out of the lives of individuals and the operations of businesses now tack the other way and welcome a good dose of state intervention to help save the economy? Cameron's economic policy was under the microscope as Brown received national and international applause.</p> <p>Friday's speech to the City was the moment when the gloves came off. The Tories would still back Brown over the banking rescue, but return to savaging his broader handling of the economy. The Prime Minister was branded a 'complete and utter failure' whose 10-year stewardship of the British economy allowed the country to build up staggering levels of personal debt. On Friday, Cameron visited South Yorkshire - where thousands of employees of Bradford &amp; Bingley and Halifax fear for their jobs - to hear voters' concerns. He now hopes to turn public anxiety into parliamentary gains in a part of England where his party desperately needs to break through.</p> <p>The 'Yorkshire triangle', which boomed on the back of financial services and now risks bust, is not the only northern region where the crisis is producing unexpected effects. Less than 50 miles away in Manchester, conventional wisdom is being turned on its head.</p> <p>Later this month, a referendum will be launched in the city asking drivers to pay a \u00a32 congestion charge to enter the traffic-choked city at rush hour. Far from being rejected by hard-up families, polling for the 'yes' campaign suggests opinion is now running at 52 per cent to 48 per cent in favour of this so-called stealth tax. Critically, \u00a33bn is promised for new public transport routes into Manchester as part of the deal - creating 10,000 jobs and allowing some families to ditch cars now becoming too expensive to run.</p> <p>'The economic scenario has transformed the debate,' says a source in the Yes Campaign. 'It's a major capital investment. This is, in effect, Manchester's insurance policy against a recession.'</p> <p>If it works, other cities will follow: Birmingham is watching closely. As is the Treasury. Could spending a few billion on better transport links in major cities be worth it to gain a once-in-a-lifetime chance to shift drivers on to greener public transport, creating jobs as a bonus?</p> <p>Such plans would be impossible if government cuts spending in response to shrinking tax receipts. But the Chancellor is now seriously considering a spending spree funded by borrowing. Just as Franklin D Roosevelt spent his way out of the Great Depression by building public works, Brown and Darling will back infrastructure projects that save jobs and stimulate the economy - initially, by bringing forward what had been long-term big plans. Shelter, the housing charity, is calling for government to buy land now while it is cheap and build social housing, keeping construction workers in jobs and providing homes for repossession victims.</p> <p>Can Brown flout the normal rules of politics and profit from a recession? A survey conducted this week by PoliticsHome.com suggests his popularity ratings are now back to April levels, before a disastrous summer of leadership speculation. He is seen as more intelligent and more decisive: the gap with Cameron is closing. 'Gordon's got his mojo back,' says one long-serving aide. So have his Cabinet: Peter Mandelson's return has, according to colleagues, brought a sharper analysis to the table that is worth any number of embarrassing tales about Russian millionaires in Corfu.</p> <p>Brown has also quietly reorganised Downing Street to focus on the economic crisis, seconding his head of policy, Dan Corry, to run a new Number 10 economics unit made up of special advisers poached from around Whitehall, including the Treasury's Sam White. Decks have been cleared of the battles hamstringing government, from 42 days' detention to children's Sats tests.</p> <p>And yesterday's controversial warning from minister Phil Woolas that immigration could become a 'thorny' issue as unemployment rises was a deliberate attempt to prevent the BNP making gains as the white working classes seek scapegoats for losing their jobs.</p> <p>The tectonic plates of British politics are shifting at a dizzying speed. In the Treasury there is unease at the pace at which the bank bail-out plan was put together, leaving many unanswered questions: it is still unclear how some of the attached conditions will work, never mind whether it will achieve its aims. The Treasury, accustomed to the ordered ritual of budgets, does not like making policy on the hoof. Unfortunately, that is a feeling that politicians entering this uncertain new dawn may have to live with for some time.</p>",
  "<p>It was a case of out with the old and in with the new on the Rowley Mile for trainer Jim Bolger as he saddled New Approach and Intense Focus for a splendid Group One double in the Champion Stakes and the Dewhurst, a race he won for the third year running. </p> <p>Sadly for racing fans, this was New Approach's final appearance before he goes for stud duties. But, happily for those of us lucky enough to be in attendance, he put up a scintillating performance, thrashing Twice Over and the rest by six lengths and more in course-record time. </p> <p>Jockey Kevin Manning gave New Approach a supremely positive ride, soon bringing him across from his wide draw to a position one off the rail behind his pacemaker Upton Grey. And it was soon evident that New Approach was going to make the most of these sensible tactics. </p> <p>Shooting clear from the furlong pole after taking the lead three out, New Approach has never looked better and it was a fitting way to bow out. In Bolger's words, New Approach 'gave me the two fingers today', suggesting that the horse, who has always been tricky, has what his trainer refers to as 'little idiosyncrasies' and knew he was having his last race. </p> <p>Bolger, whose horse had won the Dewhurst and been second in the 2,000 Guineas on this course, sounded thrilled as he said: 'It was lovely to get it all right with him today. I'm very lucky to have had a horse like him pass through my hands.' </p> <p>If it was two fingers from a departing champion, it was two noses for Intense Focus in the Dewhurst, as he crossed the line in a photograph with Lord Shanakill and Finjaan in the big two-year-old test. Soft ground has been the undoing of Intense Focus - who now wears blinkers - in several of his outings, but he floated down to the start as though the fast going would suit him. And so it proved. </p> <p>Asked to compare him with his other Dewhurst winners, Teofilo, who never raced again, and New Approach, the trainer thought for a second before opining 'He wouldn't be far behind at this stage', although the impression was that this was not quite Classic-winning form. </p> <p>On his previous run, on softer ground, he was third behind French ace Naaqoos and Freddie Head's colt is at the front of some lists for next year's 2,000 Guineas. After this result, that ante-post market is in some turmoil with the original favourite for the Classic, Rip Van Winkle, only seventh here. His stablemate, Mastercraftsman, was fourth at Longchamp so it looks as though Naaqoos is pre-eminent among the two-year-olds. </p> <p>Bolger confirmed that Intense Focus will, all being well, return here in May and he joked about Epsom too, adding: 'I cannot guarantee he will run in the Derby, but I am sure I'll have him entered. I can't let you know for certain.' This was a reference to his spat with the press over his late change of mind that sent New Approach to Epsom - and Derby victory.</p> <p>One of Naaqoos' relations was, remarkably, Landing Light, who won the Cesarewitch here for Nicky Henderson in 2003. The trainer repeated the feat in the big long-distance handicap, this time with Caracciola, last year's second, who became the oldest, at 11, to win this historic race.</p> <p>Tony Martin, trainer of runner-up Arc Bleu, and Jim Best, who saddled the unplaced Gee Dee Nen, received hefty penalties from the stewards after members of their staff were found to be in possession of prohibited substances in the stable yard. </p> <p>The stewards found that Martin had 'brought a prohibited substance and the means with which to administer it into the stable yard, without the permission of the veterinary officer.' </p> <p>They fined him \u00a31,500, while Best was fined \u00a31,000 for being in possession of a less serious substance.</p>",
  "<p>There are just 67 shopping days to Christmas, a statistic likely to strike fear into the hearts of consumers and retailers in equal measure. </p> <p>Rolls of wrapping paper and baubles are being sneaked into stores and this week the Toy Retailers Association (TRA) fired the starting gun on the Christmas shopping season with 'Dream Toys', the annual industry beano that showcases this year's predicted bestsellers. There was no bah-humbugging - at least not when Santa Claus was in earshot. Anyone saying 'I've got a bad feeling about this' was not talking about Christmas trading, but playing one of the pre-programmed message on a Star Wars Clone Trooper helmet, which at \u00a329.99 is expected to sell by the lorryload.</p> <p>Indeed, as analysts pile on the gloom, predicting the worst Christmas for retailers 'in modern times', staff running the stands at Dream Toys were as cheerful as the cast of High School Musical 3. 'Santa Claus is still on his way and parents will still buy their children toys - we just have to make sure we have choice and affordable options,' says Emma Sherski, marketing director at Vivid Imaginations, which expects to sell 45,000 HSM3 dance mats - a snip at \u00a322.99 - this Christmas.</p> <p>However, the jargon of the credit crunch has reached Toytown: manufacturers have started using the phrase 'cost per play' to promote a toy's merit - a challenge that would test the mettle of the toddler who gets a ride-on Kota the Triceratops dinosaur, weighing in at a hefty \u00a3299.99.</p> <p>'I think consumers are going to be looking for more value,' says TRA chairman Gary Grant, who predicts that toy sales will be flat over the Christmas period. Grant, who owns the Entertainer toy chain, added that sales had been 'appalling' over the past fortnight as consumers absorbed the worst financial turmoil for a generation. </p> <p>Respected retail analyst Richard Hyman is of the 'glass half empty' school: 'This Christmas is going to be the worst retailers have experienced in modern times. The past five years have been forecast as the \"worst ever\" and that hasn't been the case; this year it will be. What is going on in the real economy is affecting every household in the country. Spending power is substantially diminished and that is going to be reflected in retail sales.'</p> <p>In its annual Christmas spending survey, Deloitte estimated that consumers would spend \u00a3706 each in 2007, a 7 per cent increase on 2006. Tarlok Teji, head of retail at Deloitte, who is putting the finishing touches to this year's study, estimates that figure will be 'flat or slightly down' this year. The figure of \u00a3706 breaks down as \u00a3385 on gifts, \u00a3178 on food and \u00a3143 on socialising.</p> <p>Food and entertainment are expected to be the soundest retail sectors, as the former is deemed a seasonal necessity, while book and music sales are expected to be buoyed by the strong line-up of new releases aimed at the Christmas market. In fact, food price inflation, which is currently estimated to be 9.3 per cent, could add to the pressure on the high street as households divert spending from other areas rather than scrimp on treats.</p> <p>Money-saving nights in are good for the UK's \u00a33bn book industry, with a third of sales taken in the 'golden quarter' that includes Christmas. 'The book industry is reasonably optimistic about the outlook,' says Neill Denny, editor-in-chief of The Bookseller. 'Books are a recession favourite because they are a good gift and don't break; also the demise of the Net Book Agreement means they are cheaper than during the last recession. You can buy a book for \u00a33.79 from Asda, which is less than a pint of bitter.' The bestseller lists are likely to include Dawn French's Dear Fatty and ubiquitous cookery titles from Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson, while albums by Razorlight, Snow Patrol and Keane are expected to boost sales at HMV and Zavvi.</p> <p>The internet should continue to exert pressure on high-street rivals. Amazon UK's managing director Brian McBride is predicting its 'biggest Christmas ever' as it goes head-to-head with bricks-and-mortar retailers on eagerly anticipated DVDs such as Batman sequel The Dark Knight and Abba musical Mamma Mia!, as well as electricals and toys. 'In tough times people will do without a couple of pints or a night out to buy their children something for Christmas,' he says. 'Very few retailers come out of a recession unchanged, but it's up to you whether you are the agent of change or a victim of circumstance.'</p> <p>However, bargain hunters may be disappointed: while products such as toys and electricals will be keenly priced, Hyman predicts fewer pre-Christmas sales because retailers will have bought less stock: 'There will undoubtedly be promotional activity in the run-up to Christmas, but I don't think there will be a massive amount. Retailers will be going into the period with lower stock levels and there will be an impetus to sell that at full price.'</p>",

This found immediate agreement from Villa, with the club saying they would work with the police 'to examine CCTV cameras and find the culprit'.</p> <p>Villa manager Martin O'Neill agreed, before moving on to the game and saying, correctly: 'I thought we would win, especially in the second half. But the ball just wouldn't bounce for us, and there was John Carew's header that grazed the bar.'</p> <p>That chance came right at the finish of a match in which Villa were far sharper and looked the more credible candidates to challenge for a fifth-place finish, their position at the day's start.</p> <p>Jermain Defoe, in sparkling form this season for Portsmouth and England, was the visitors' brightest player during the first half. But he faded and, other than the point, there were few other positives for Redknapp. Defoe looks to have become more aware, which will please Fabio Capello, and he did, at first, find space and distribute smartly. But he also missed a good chance - the affliction both sides suffered - after 28 minutes. It came when Armand Traor\u00e9 belted a shot that beat Brad Friedel, but hit the goalkeeper's right post. Defoe snatched a volley at the rebound and spooned the ball over.</p> <p>Like Redknapp, O'Neill plumped for a 4-4-2, with Gabriel Agbonlahor partnering Carew in attack. Yet the 22-year-old's beginnings in senior football as a wide-man were obvious as instinct - and his lightning pace - took him left on enough occasions to collect from the excellent Ashley Young and worry Portsmouth.</p> <p>Portsmouth were making too many mistakes. Glen Johnson and a quiet Peter Crouch - one early shot went too high, a header before the break had no power - were the main offenders, giving away possession in midfield and thereby allowing Villa to turn Portsmouth and unleash Ashley Young and Agbonlahor. While O'Neill had the easier chat before the teams returned for the second half, each manager could have done with a little of Capello's apparent magic at this juncture.</p> <p>Portsmouth deteriorated and Villa should have ended with three points. But they could not execute their chances. Soon after the restart Stilian Petrov found Young with a diagonal pass. Yet the winger chose to control the ball first rather than bang it hard with his right foot, and the opportunity was lost.</p> <p>Then, after Sean Davis was sent off by the prolific Mike Riley, it was time for the unfortunate Sharp to be hit. </p> <h2>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</h2> <p><strong>Mark Rutter, Observer reader</strong> I was slightly confused by our selection policy \u2013 we started the game with Cu\u00e9llar at right-back, Barry at left-back and our two regular full-backs on the bench. Perhaps Martin was looking forward to Ajax on Thursday, but Cu\u00e9llar and Milner on the right didn't work. Milner had a very poor game and, despite seeing a lot of the ball, there was no end product. Pompey were more than happy to sit back and take a point after half-time and if Milner had had his crossing boots on, we might have created a bit more. Redknapp isn't the most popular manager at Villa Park after calling our fans 'filth' last season, but his team were very strong, they came to play and they probably just about deserved a point.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Friedel 6; Cu\u00e9llar 5, Davies 6, Laursen 6, <br>(L Young n/a), Barry 6; Milner 4, Petrov 8, Reo-Coker 7, A Young 7; Carew 7, Agbonlahor 6</p> <p><strong>Mick Dunford, <a href=\"http://www.pompey.org\">Pompey.org</a></strong> A good result for us, although it was a strange game in some ways. I thought we looked the better side in the first half and Villa's only threat came from set pieces. Redknapp decided to play it a lot more defensive than we have been in recent away games, with Pamarot in place of Belhadj at left-back. He completely shut down Milner and we stopped Villa from working the flanks. They were more dangerous after half-time and I was slightly concerned when Davis got sent off. But Redknapp made an immediate substitution and it speaks volumes that although James had a fragile game in goal, he only really had one save to make late on. The Villa fans directed some abuse at Redknapp but that was probably because they didn't have much else to cheer about.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> James 6; Johnson 6, Distin 7, Campbell 8, Pamarot 7; Little 7 (Utaka 5), Diop\u25a0 8, Davis 7, A Traor\u00e9 6 (Belhadj 7); Defoe 6 (Mvuemba 6), Crouch 7 </p> <p><strong><em>To take part in the Verdict, email fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>In the forests of birch and pine, shafts of autumn light fall through the branches and lie in puddles on the mossy, mulchy floor, and you can see them, smell them, almost feel them growing and rotting and dying all around. The wood is full of mushrooms and fungi. There are brick-coloured, bay or sinister purple boletus with slimy caps; cream and beige puffballs sending up a mist of spores when you touch them; lilac blewits, the red-topped beechwood sickener, copious rings of fairy mushrooms and trooping crumble caps, scarlet warty fly agaric. Black, eerie green, dull chalky white, pale brown, greasy yellow, grey, buff; mushrooms shaped like cauliflowers, like UFOs, like dead leaves, like spiders' webs; high in trees or under logs, hidden in the earth or erupting in ditches. They often have human names (the prince, the blusher) or names of body parts (the shank, the foot), and can look uncannily like flesh and entrails - pus-filled boils, scabs forming along logs, dead fingers flopping in the undergrowth, vital organs spilled out onto the grass, giant yellow ears listening on tree trunks, tumours among the roots, pieces of disintegrating flesh sliding down the hummocks, piles of fetid dung, snotty gunk in the earth's crevices - and like dead flesh they rot, flyblown and maggoty, sending up rich strange odours: almond, coconut, geraniums, apricot, sickly sweet meat - a stew of compost, a fruity sweet decay. </p> <p>It is no wonder that many people find these slimy, rotting growths repellent, while others (like me) adore them and can become obsessed. Unlike most plants, mushrooms do not have chlorophyll. Rather, they are like animals, and take their nutrients ready-made from plants and even from animals. They are parasites and live on dead things. To reproduce, they drop and shoot spores. They grow in dark, hidden places - and they grow quickly. You can spot a scattering of tiny nubs on the soil one day and the next day return to pick them. Standing in a Swedish forest in autumn, it doesn't feel at all surprising that these fungoid growths can kill. </p> <p>The most common poisonous mushroom is the fly agaric, a powerful hallucinogen used by the Lapps, and also by reindeer: you're not likely to eat it, though, because it looks so dangerous, its redness sending up warning signals (although its smell is faint and it tastes quite pleasant). Its name comes from the practice in medieval times of breaking it into pieces and adding it to milk to stupefy flies. Eat it, and the symptoms begin 20 minutes to two hours later: the central nervous system is affected, the muscles pull and twitch spasmodically; then comes dizziness, deep death-like sleep, although it doesn't usually kill. </p> <p>The writer Nicholas Evans, along with his wife and his brother- and sister-in-law, very nearly died last month when they ate Cortinarius speciosissimus, otherwise known as fool's webcap (in my mushroom bible, Mushrooms and other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe by Roger Phillips, the edibility of many cortinarius is 'unknown' but the speciosissimus is recognised as dangerous). It has a reddish-brown cap and rust-coloured gills, and can apparently be mistaken for a chanterelle. It is found mostly in coniferous woodlands in the Highlands - which is where Nicholas Evans picked it. Eating it is often fatal: it attacks the kidneys (Evans suffered acute kidney failure) and spinal cord, and breaks the liver into pulp. He and his mushroom-picking companions were lucky to survive.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, a woman on the Isle of Wight wasn't so lucky - she died after she and her companion ate the death cap (Amanita phalloides). This is Britain's most deadly fungus, responsible for 90 per cent of death by mushroom poisoning. It grows in deciduous woodlands and really doesn't look too bad: it has a greenish-yellow cap, convex at first and then flattened as it grows; a smooth white stem, white flesh and gills. I have no idea what it tastes like, but if you eat it, it takes between six and 24 hours before there are the first symptoms of violent diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach ache - and then (this is the cruel part) apparent recovery. But the poison is secretly at work, attacking the liver and kidney and being then reabsorbed into the blood to circulate once more, causing repeated damage. </p> <p>The trouble is, the death cap looks to me exactly like hundreds and thousands of other fungi with white gills and brownish caps. I'm no expert on mushrooms, just an avid amateur. I strictly avoid anything with white gills. I even avoid touching them. I don't pick anything that I'm not 100 per cent sure of, and therefore, when I go mushroom hunting, I look for only half a dozen or so of the many thousand fungi that can be found in Europe. </p> <p>On this occasion, in the deep wood in Sweden, I am looking for ceps, chanterelles, horn of plenty and a small brown mushroom with a funnelled cap whose English name I don't know, but which grows plentifully through the cool damp autumns, like drifts of sodden leaves. Ceps (also known as penny buns) are the magnificent kings of mushrooms, firm and stout with a brown cap and white flesh. They look robust and taste almost meaty, with a mushroomy, Marmitey smell when dried (we have bought a drier from Switzerland, with stack of shelves on which we place thin slices of cep before turning on the humidifier). One sniff and I'm back in the mysterious forests, light falling on to soft mossy earth. Some years, they are hard to find here; others, they are plentiful. One of the points of mushroom-hunting is that you never know where you'll find them and there are days when you return empty handed. And if ceps are the kings, chanterelles (which Nicholas Evans apparently thought he was picking) are the queens: they are a lovely egg yellow, with a tapering shape and gills running from the stem to the slightly depressed cap. When they are old, they become large and soggy, grime sticking to them making them hard to clean. They are often found in patches along paths, but in spite of their yolky colour, they can hide from view, under moss or roots. Horn of plenty is the hardest to find: they are small, tubular (hence the name - though some know them as trompette d'amour), and lie on the ground in thin, leathery crisps, almost indistinguishable from dead leaves. When we're lucky enough to find them we cook them with garlic and serve them on brochettes.</p> <p>I grew up picking wild mushrooms, and many of my earliest memories involve looking for mushrooms with my parents, stumbling through woods after them on drizzly October afternoons. Other families went for walks, we went for hunts. My father was always an inveterate experimenter, and there was something slightly reckless about many of the mushrooms we picked and brought home to be laid out on the kitchen table like specimens in a laboratory. He would take out his mushroom book, put on his reading glasses and examine each mushroom in turn, holding them up, breaking the cap off the stem, cutting open their flesh, smelling them and even - or is this a false memory? - taking tiny experimental tastes. He had a blithe confidence in his deductive skills, and with an anxious kind of resolve, we would eat anything he pronounced edible. Puffballs, even if they were losing their essential firmness. Common ink caps, even if they were opening out from their ideal ovoid shape and beginning to blacken and stain at their skirts (Ink caps should never be eaten with alcohol, as they can make you very sick - indeed, Roger Phillips writes that they have been given to alcoholics to cure them). Parasol mushrooms - which are delicate and delicious but which, to me anyway, look too like death caps to be sure of. St George's mushrooms, though again, they are white-gilled and I still need to be with my father to be sure of them. </p> <p>It wasn't just the finding, but the preparing and cooking. You have to get them home quite quickly - mushrooms grow fast and they rot fast; if you put them in a plastic bag they will soon turn slimy - and then brush off all the soil and cut away the woody or maggoty bits before cooking. Mushroom risotto, mushroom with pasta, mushroom in casseroles, mushroom soup, mushroom sauce, mushroom pie, mushrooms on toast, or simply mushrooms - as an accompaniment or, in the case of a meaty type like cep, as a whole meal. </p> <p>It's usually something you have taught to you, and then it's something that you pass on, like a secret knowledge. When my husband, Sean, and I met, we discovered that one of the things we had in common was a childhood spent hunting for mushrooms - he in Sweden, where he spent every summer with his extended Swedish family, me in Scotland and in Worcestershire, where I grew up. The first thriller we wrote together as Nicci French begins with a family mushroom hunt, and perhaps this was appropriate - mushrooms grow in shadows and darkness; mushrooms and death go together very well. As our parents had taught us, so we taught our own children about mushrooms, carrying or dragging them through pouring rain into dense forests, showing them where to look for ceps and chanterelles, rooting around in the damp soil for our edible treasure. </p> <p>Why is mushroom-picking such a glorious pleasure, even an addiction for some? Why is it that during my summer holidays in Sweden, where we go each year, I can spend entire days in the woods, whatever the weather, stooping under trees, pushing through bracken, up to my ankles in mud, bitten by mosquitoes, scratched by brambles, whipped by branches, searching for my supper. It can't just be the hunter-gatherer instinct. In the summer we also pick blueberries, raspberries and wild strawberries, and fish in the lake for perch and pike. Sometimes we manage to eat meals made entirely from what we've caught and foraged, and there's nothing to beat the sense of triumph and virtue and old-fashioned thrift, nor the way that each bite tastes good - this in spite of the fact that pike is a nasty muddy fish that has to be disguised by lots of butter and horseradish before it's fit to eat, and perch gives you mouthfuls of tiny bones; in spite of pieces of bugs and stalks in the pudding. Sean makes nettle soup (good), dandelion salad (bitter), elderflower wine (exploded all over the kitchen floor) and he has even cooked snails from our garden (an arduous and insane process that ended up with dozens of miniature blobs that looked and tasted like the little rubbers from the ends of pencils, floating on a sea of garlic butter). </p> <p>But picking mushrooms goes beyond the pleasure of food for free. In part this is because you never know if you are going to find them. You know where the raspberry and blueberry bushes are, but not where the ceps will be. They don't grow in the same place twice - although mushroom hunters all have their secret sites, which they don't divulge even to other members of the family; indeed, it's not really good manners to ask anyone exactly where they found their haul, and I always feel slightly aggrieved if I come across others on 'my' particular patch. (A few years ago, one of Sean's Swedish cousins separated from her partner and he, in his final act of revenge, left without ever telling anyone where he managed to find such triumphant amounts of horn of plenty.) There is nothing to beat the satisfaction of coming out of a wood carrying bags full of mushrooms, to see someone else going hopefully in with an empty basket.</p> <p>And perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that you have to learn about mushrooms. It's not just anyone who can go out and pick them. It's a skill (although not a very hard skill if you only reach the level of someone like me, with a handful of types I can recognise without a shadow of a doubt). It makes us mushroom pickers into a strange little community (if I see someone picking mushrooms then, as long as they're not on my patch, I feel a bond with them). </p> <p>But I also think that the repellence of mushrooms, their closeness to dead animal flesh and indeed their danger, is part of the pleasure - like eating blowfish. If you go blackberry-picking, you don't worry that the crumble you cook later might cause you to vomit or your kidneys to pack up on you. Mushrooms, on the other hand, are a food that's close to poison; they can be hallucinogenic and associated with curses and magic (hence magic mushrooms); they have a greasy texture that disgusts; they can taste rich and almost rancid. They grow in dark, dank, forgotten places, and even as they ripen they rot and even as they live, they die. </p> <h2>Omelette with cherry tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms and marigold petals</h2> <p>If you feel like having this omelette, don't deprive yourself just because there are no marigolds to hand - I only added them here after an opportunistic forage in the garden! But by the same token, if you find some, perhaps they will encourage you to make this dish. They do look very pretty scattered over the tomatoes and add a subtle peppery flavour. </p> <p>Serves 2</p> <p><strong>200g shiitake or oyster mushrooms<br>olive oil <br>6 eggs<br>50ml milk<br>salt and freshly ground black pepper<br>6 red cherry tomatoes<br>6 yellow cherry tomatoes<br>cheese (optional)<br>marigold petals from the garden</strong></p> <p>Fry the mushrooms in olive oil, then drain on kitchen paper and keep warm. </p> <p>In a bowl, whisk the eggs together with the milk, then season with salt and pepper.</p> <p>In a separate pan, heat some more olive oil until it's nice and hot, then pour in the egg mixture.When the eggs are nearly cooked through, add the raw tomatoes and cooked mushrooms. At this stage you could add some cheese if you fancy it.</p> <p>Sprinkle in the flower petals, fold the omelette over and serve.</p> <h2>Luxury three layer parmentier</h2> <p>This type of French shepherd's pie is traditionally a dish for using up leftover beef and vegetables. Here I'm using tinned confit of duck.</p> <p>Serves 6-8</p> <p><strong>6 legs of confit of duck <br>25g butter<br>olive oil<br>2 shallots, finely chopped<br>1 garlic clove, finely chopped<br>220g wild mushrooms<br>500g potatoes, peeled, boiled and mashed<br>500g sweet potatoes, peeled, boiled and mashed</strong></p> <p>Heat the duck legs, together with their fat, gently in a saucepan. Remove from the fat and pull the meat apart, keeping the pieces fairly chunky and substantial. Reserve. Melt the butter and a little oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Sweat the shallots and garlic but do not colour. Add the mushrooms to the pan and lightly fry until they are golden and slightly crispy. Reserve until required for the topping. In a large gratin dish build up the layers, starting with duck, followed by mashed and sweet potato, and ending with the mushroom mixture. You can serve this immediately if all the ingredients are nice and warm. Alternatively, cover lightly with foil and reheat later in a warm oven.</p> <p>\u2022 Trish's French Kitchen by Trish Deseine (Kyle Cathie, \u00a319.99) is out now.

  "<p>You want to try to save money when eating out? Oh my giddy goatburger. Readers, it is once more to the dining breach. Let us be frank with each other. For this is no time to mince words. This is the time to mince cheap beef and serve it as a family supper for 50p a head, potatoes and seasonings extra. You say you want advice on how to budget in restaurants during the economic downturn? Let me be the first to tell you that the most effective way to budget in a restaurant during an economic downturn is to cancel your stupid reservation. </p> <p>What are you thinking about? You could knit clogs for the kids for the next decade with what dinner for four at Le Tout Snoot will cost you. If money is too tight to mention, stay at home instead. Crack open a tin of chickpeas (save that juice for a nourishing soup). Barbecue the dog on a bonfire made of your own furniture. Drink tap. Don't mind the hunger gap. Sell the kids. Just say no. </p> <p>For you don't need me to tell you that times are tough out there. Money is not rough puff or flaky. It is short. Things are so desperate that I even find myself making lame jokes about pastry. The shame of it. We are armpit deep in a recession and in a recession, the first things to go from the household budget of even the most dedicated diner are taxis and restaurants. Wave bye-bye to the starched napkin and the service charge for the time being. Say hello to the bus stop and the stockpot. Ask yourself how you ever managed to afford roast chicken with truffles for two at La Petite Maison and still have change out of a Landsbanki high interest account. For many of us, turning on the heating, not having the waiter bring you another slice of foie gras terrine with a glass of Sauternes, is what constitutes a luxury now. </p> <p>So habits change. They have to. Since early September, the restaurant trade in the UK has been hurting bad. In France, it has been even worse. Brasseries and bistros have been closing like a narcolept's eyelids. People are eating out less, for obvious reasons, but they still want to enjoy themselves. Many are trying to recreate the restaurant experience at home. If the food costs are four times less - which is the average restaurant mark up - then why not? Earlier this month, Tesco reported that sales of its own label duck breasts were up nine per cent, with racks of lamb up over 300 per cent. That's a lot of fancy cooking going on out there. </p> <p>Meanwhile, UK national sales of chocolate and subscriptions to online dating are rocketing. Interesting. As tumbleweeds roll through our favourite restaurants, we're all too busy eating tubes of Rolos and snogging complete strangers to notice. </p> <p>The one good thing about a recession is that it acts as quality control on the catering trade, sifting out the overpriced and over-inflated. Things will get better for everyone in restaurants, probably sooner rather than later. And look at it this way. No matter how much in love you are with Croydon Snugglebuns or Lovely Rita(GSOH) whom you met on debts'r'us.com, you can't stay in forever. You've got to go out to dinner sooner or later. So here are my credit crunch do's and don'ts. </p> <p>Don't be that party on table eight who ask if they can split a main course between six and have you got any bones for their (ahem) dog while they are at it. Don't order one glass of house white and produce half a dozen straws for everyone when it appears. Don't order the cheeseburger with fries and salad, then ask the waiter to hold the fries, the greens, the cheese and the burger. If all you can afford is a soft bap, then go right ahead and ask for one. Don't marry one, like Katie Price did, but note that being cash poor and asset stripped no longer has any social stigma. We're all in the same leaky boat. When all else fails, remember we are proud northern Europeans. We have our customs and age old traditions to keep us going through these difficult times. I don't mean the cheese fondue at Cosy Alpine Corner or the sauerkraut sandwiches at Bouchon Breton. No. When all else fails, let's conform to our international stereotype, and spend all out money on booze instead.</p>",
  "<p>There are reasons Tony Pulis is, possibly, the happiest manager in the Premier League this season. Although his team are in the relegation zone - where they are expected to spend roughly the entire season - he brings a sense of joy to his job that comes from spending a lifetime clambering up a ladder in search of the footballing stars. 'If it finished tomorrow, I'd still feel like the luckiest man alive,' he says. </p> <p>In the same way that Sir Alex Ferguson's upbringing in the Govan shipyards is credited with instilling some of his indefatigable resolve, Pulis's background in the Newport docks fuels him with a desire to make the best of every day. His eight-strong family lived in a three-bedroom house. 'The four boys slept in one bed,' he announces proudly. 'We made things for ourselves, we did things for ourselves. We had nothing, but we had everything. I take it for granted that you have to work to get anything out of life. That, maybe, is what people miss today.' And people wonder why his Stoke team play with such a capacity to graft. </p> <p>Few would have expected Pulis, who served a 16-year apprenticeship in the lower divisions before breathing in the sweet air of the big time, to go into today's match looking down on Juande Ramos, twice a Uefa Cup winner with Sevilla, and with an English trophy in the cabinet. </p> <p>Tottenham's shambolic form, juxtaposed with the extraordinary example being set by Hull, is a timely reminder of what Pulis reckons is a bit of a myth about imported coaches. 'Foreign has been fashionable,' he tuts. </p> <p>With the exception of Paul Ince, whose pedigree as an international player gives him that extra stature, the other British managers new to the Premier League this season have all had to earn their shot at it by winning promotion. Would anyone already at the top table have taken a chance on Pulis, Tony Mowbray or Phil Brown? </p> <p>'I have met with [Rafa] Ben\u00edtez and [Luiz Felipe] Scolari and they are fantastic, real gentlemen,' says the 50-year-old Pulis. 'But what gripes with me is I am sure there are very, very good British coaches out there who, given the resources and opportunity they have, would achieve success needed at that level. </p> <p>'Years ago people like Ron Atkinson and Jim Smith were not great players, but they earned their corn and learned their trade working at lower-league clubs. Being successful there gave them the opportunity to work at big clubs. That doesn't happen now.' </p> <p>Are Stoke a big club? Premier League survival would go a long way to improving their status, and Pulis is adamant the potential is there. This is his second spell holding the reins at the Britannia Stadium and Pulis detects a significant shift in ambition and organisation, with local businessman and former chairman Peter Coates having taken over from Pulis' previous employers from Iceland. 'It has changed completely,' Pulis explains. 'The Icelandic directors were trying to run a football club from 2,000 miles away. </p> <p>'I think we have come an enormous distance in the two years since I came back. But the important thing is you don't go from step one to step five.' Hence, Pulis wants for nothing more than a solid campaign that ends up with Stoke above three other teams - whoever, and however, is irrelevant. </p> <p>'We have been competitive, and to be honest we are disappointed with the return of points we've got. In every game we have actually been close to either drawing or winning. If there was anything I could ask for it would just be a little more run of the ball.' </p> <p>They could also do with more conviction in front of goal. Ricardo Fuller has three goals so far this season, but his new strike partner Dave Kitson, signed for \u00a35.5m just before the start of the campaign, is yet to score. Pulis expects him to put that right imminently.</p> <p>Stoke are in good company at the moment, going into the weekend sandwiched between Newcastle and Tottenham. If that suggests there will be more teams than anticipated involved in the survival race, Pulis thinks otherwise: 'First of all, it's very early in the season and when the lines are drawn at the end of the season I don't see Newcastle and Tottenham down there. They have too many resources. Also, the league is more competitive this year. The teams that finished last season just above the bottom three have all invested quite heavily. </p> <p>'Look at what Gary Megson has spent at Bolton, or what Wigan and Fulham have spent. So those teams have all added to squads that were already strong enough to stay in the Premier League. It's going to be difficult for us. One point, or even goal difference above three teams, is what we are looking for.' </p> <p>Pulis has always been prudent. Not many 23-year-olds in the early 1980s went to play on the other side of the world. Soon to be married, he spent the 1981-82 season in Hong Kong with Happy Valley purely so he could save enough money to put a deposit down on his first house when he returned. His Stoke side may not be the darlings of the Premier League, but they will appreciate the meaning of every point they earn.</p>",
  "<p>If there are still critics of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray\">Andy Murray</a> south of the border, their numbers, surely, must be dwindling. The finest player Britain has produced since Fred Perry burnished his soaring reputation here in the semi-final of the ATP Masters Madrid by beating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/federer\">Roger Federer</a> 3-6 6-3 7-5.</p> <p>Murray will now play the rising French star Gilles Simon, who battled Rafael Nadal in an extraordinary 3hr 22min marathon and came through to win 3-6 7-5 7-6, winning the tiebreak 8-6. Simon, who had saved six match points in earlier matches, says he never gets tired. Murray will test that today.</p> <p>It was Murray's third victory over the former world No1 in five meetings and offered some measure of revenge for the defeat he suffered against Federer in last month's US Open final. Despite being unable to prevent Britain losing to Austria in the Davis Cup, there is very little Murray has done wrong in the past three months and, if anything, his world ranking of No 4 looks beneath him. With Novak Djokovic going off the boil, the 21-year-old Scot has certainly looked like the third best player in the world since August, especially as he beat Djokovic in successive weeks at Toronto and Cincinnati.</p> <p>His reputation in the place where it counts most, the tour locker room, is that of a player who has it all. Any coach and most rivals will talk to you about his unerring accuracy off the ground, his fine serve and his deceptive speed. And Federer, in particular, talks of his tactical acumen - the ability to think on his feet and change his approach if things are not going his way.</p> <p>That is precisely what he needed to do here yesterday after a tentative first set that had seen him still unable to shake off the nerves he had felt when facing his legendary opponent in his first Grand Slam final in New York. The previous day he had spoken of being more relaxed here - which was only natural, given the fact that he had not had to face Nadal in a protracted battle over two days, as he did at the US Open - as well as the brilliance of his own form while dismissing as good a player as Ga\u00ebl Monfils 6-2 6-2 here in the quarter-finals.</p> <p>But there was no doubt Federer deserved the first set, partially as a result of the kind of errors that cost Murray the break in the sixth game - a forehand that sailed long. But there were no histrionics, an improvement in his game that Federer noted afterwards.</p> <p>'You need to give young guys time to learn,' said Federer, who had temperament problems of his own in his teens. 'It's fun to see them learning.' But the Swiss found it less fun to see how Murray was able to turn the match around; slowly pressing the accelerator until his game took on a more aggressive mode.</p> <p>At deuce in the fourth game of the second set, Murray unleashed a superb forehand service return that Federer hardly saw and was in at the net on the break point to finish the game. Murray never allowed Federer a sniff of a break back as he levelled the match and, despite having to stave off a break point at 0-1 in the third, he seemed to have taken control when he got Federer 0-40 down in the third game. But Federer was playing at close to his best and reeled off five consecutive points to hold.</p> <p>Murray, looking composed by this stage, had another break point at 2-2, but Federer's responses were helping to elevate the contest to the kind of duel the capacity 9,600 crowd wanted.</p> <p>Murray continued to serve with great authority - he had not lost a point on his first serve in the second set - and with his returns starting to bite, Federer found himself facing another break point in the 11th game.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/aberdeen\">Aberdeen</a> changed places with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/falkirk\">Falkirk</a>, dropping their victims into bottom place in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scottishpremierleague\">SPL</a>, in a match which was poor enough not to need being further tarnished by the decision of referee Willie Collum to send off the home defender, Lee Bullen, in injury time.</p> <p>As Bullen challenged Scott Severin, the Aberdeen defender clearly did not have the ball under control, but the official decided he had been denied a clear scoring opportunity. That was a genuine rarity on a day when Lee Miller's headed winner was the highlight. </p> <p>It took until the second half, but that goal from Miller relieved some of the consternation Aberdeen fans would otherwise have experienced at the cautious strategy of manager, Jimmy Calderwood. Given their pre-match position, his reliance on so many central defenders seemed out of place in a match that demanded an aggressiveness to maximise their chances of a win. </p> <p>Lee Mair and Andrew Considine, both normally to be found in the middle, were the full-backs, while Severin, normally a midfielder, joined Zander Diamond in the middle of the back four, and the regular left-back, Richie Foster, was pushed forward into midfield.</p> <p>It was a line-up that looked like an invitation to Falkirk to play in the visitors' half of the field, with the latter depending on the counter-thrust. That was the pattern that would develop, but, for most of the time, with little promise of either team's strategy yielding a goal.</p> <p>With both sides struggling for incision going forward, especially during a largely uninspiring first half, it was probably lack of practice that led to them spurning the few half-chances that arose.</p> <p>The more ambitious Falkirk, predictably, produced the first of them when Michael Higdon supplied Neil McCann on the left and the winger's cross was perfectly measured for Steve Lovell at the far corner of the six-yard box.</p> <p>The striker, however, appeared to be having to twist his body as he rose, and simply screwed the ball well wide of Jamie Langfield's right post. </p> <p>It took, however, a terrific defensive header from Diamond to frustrate Higdon and Lovell, as both appeared ready to exploit Jackie McNamara's cross from the right before the defender's intervention. During the entire first half, Aberdeen's only genuine opportunity was contrived by Stewart Duff, who took possession from a poor clearing header and squared the pass to Lee Miller. The striker pulled his right-foot shot several feet wide. </p> <p>Miller has always been more reliable in the air, however, and there was little danger of him squandering the chance that came from Considine's impeccable cross from the left early in the second half. Sone Aluko, who had replaced Duff, played a short pass to the left-back and his delivery allowed Miller a free header from six yards, which sent the ball low into Scott Flinders' right corner.</p> <p>Calderwood had recognised the need for change long before his counterpart John Hughes and had also replaced Mark Kerr with Gary McDonald before the Falkirk manager made a change of his own. Hughes, however, waited until Lovell had wasted the most convertible chance of the match before taking off his partner, Higdon, and throwing on Graham Barrett.</p> <p>It was the veteran McCann who first lost possession and then fought hard to recover the ball before moving forward and playing a wonderfully perceptive pass to Lovell through the inside-left channel. The pace and accuracy left the striker on his own just inside the six-yard box, from where he managed to scoop the ball over the crossbar.</p>",
  "<p>Pro-choice campaigners warned last night that a parliamentary bill aimed at extending the 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland offers the last chance of giving women the right to terminate pregnancies in the province.</p> <p>They say there will be little chance of the law being extended once policing and justice powers are devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The new ministry will be dominated by the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein, both of which firmly oppose such a move. The abortion amendment is due to be introduced into the House of Commons on Wednesday, but there are fears it will fall off the parliamentary timetable because the time allotted for the debate has been so curtailed. Pro-choice MPs and groups allege this is due to a private deal between Downing Street and the Democratic Unionist party - a claim both dispute.</p> <p>Anna Lo, the Alliance party assembly member who is one of only two pro-choice politicians at Stormont, said the bill was the 'last ever chance' to introduce the 1967 act into Northern Ireland. 'If and when policing and justice are devolved, I fear the DUP and Sinn Fein will ensure no law is introduced to bring us in line with the UK. So this is the very last chance for the foreseeable future to extend the 1967 act. The status quo means that a woman in Bangor, Wales, has the right to free access to abortion on the NHS while a woman from Bangor, Co Down, has no access and instead has to travel to Britain and pay privately for a termination. Yet both women pay the same taxes.</p> <p>'It would be a disgrace if this bill was shot down through parliamentary trickery. And if that was to happen it still won't stop thousands of women travelling to Britain for terminations each year.'</p> <p>Several hundred anti-abortion activists descended on Stormont to voice their opposition to the bill. Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson predicted there would be a 'constitutional crisis' with Westminster if the motion is passed. He told the rally that, if the bill was introduced, the assembly would refuse to implement it. He said the leaders of the four main parties, Peter Robinson (DUP), Gerry Adams (Sinn Fein), Sir Reg Empey (Ulster Unionists) and Mark Durkan (SDLP), had signed a joint letter to every MP urging them to vote down the bill. He confirmed that the DUP would ensure that a future devolved ministry controlling law and the judiciary would continue to ban abortion. </p> <p>Northern Ireland's Catholic bishops warned MPs that any attempt to make abortion legal would be 'intruding' on the peace process and failing to uphold a fundamental value that has consistently united main traditions on the island of Ireland.' At a '40 women protest' in Derry - a rally to mark the number of women each week who travel to Britain for abortions - the Alliance for Choice said the bishops of 'talking nonsense'.</p>",
  "<p>Winston Churchill once said that in wartime truth was so precious that it needed to be surrounded by a \"bodyguard of lies\". In America's presidential campaign \u2013 and, sadly, within Iraq itself nowadays \u2013 the Iraq war may not be surrounded by a bodyguard of lies, but it has certainly picked up a vast entourage of partisan half-truths, cynical indifference and uninformed stubbornness. </p> <p>America's Democrats continue to argue for complete withdrawal of US forces from Iraq within 18 months, despite the fact that no rational observer believes that Iraqi forces will by then be able to secure Iraq's borders and face down the country's numerous militias, which remain armed to the teeth. </p> <p>Indeed, the <a href=\"http://origin.barackobama.com/issues/iraq/\">Democratic plan</a> (if it can be called one) ignores Iran's ongoing subversion of Iraq's state institutions, which will continue unless and until they become strong enough to resist such machinations. Moreover, Barack Obama's insistence that Iraq has never constituted a central front in the war on terror insults the memory of the tens of thousands \u2013 perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2013 of Iraqi civilians and US troops murdered by al-Qaida's suicide bombers since 2003. Indeed, by 2004, the terrorists themselves regarded Iraq as the central front of their campaign. </p> <p>Nor can one be buoyed by Joseph Biden's repeated calls for a \"soft partition\" of Iraq, even though the entire Iraqi political class has rejected the notion. </p> <p>As for the Republicans, setting aside Sarah Palin's talk of America's divine mission in the war on terror, it is inconceivable that John McCain truly <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/fdeb03a7-30b0-4ece-8e34-4c7ea83f11d8.htm\">believes</a> that a US presence is sustainable in Iraq into the indefinite future. To be fair, McCain never suggested that US troops will wage 100 years of war, as some of his critics claim. What McCain was referring to was a peaceable presence of US forces in the country for a long period, rather like their continued presence in Japan since 1945. </p> <p>Still, even assuming that the American public would tolerate such a presence, the Iraqi public would not. America has made too many policy mistakes, US forces are too closely associated with an unpopular and incompetent occupation, and, until recently, their tactics have been too thuggish to permit talk of a permanent presence. </p> <p>While most Iraqis understand the need for US forces to be in their country for the short term, they will not abide a permanent deployment. McCain's advisors would do well to consider a historical precedent: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/apr/19/iraq.arts\">failed British attempt</a> at the end of the first world war to maintain a long-term military presence in Iraq. </p> <p>Iraqi politicians have not been exempt from posturing for political gain. The government committed a number of blunders in its negotiations on the continued presence of US troops. Indeed, this summer it injected itself into the US elections by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,566841,00.html\">seeming to endorse</a> Obama's plan for early withdrawal. Then again, for three consecutive years, Iraq's national security advisor \u2013 a physician with no credentials for the job when appointed by the US occupation authority, except that he spoke tolerable English \u2013 insisted that the next year would be the last in which American troops were needed. </p> <p>Iraq's government is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/iraq-military\">demanding</a> a withdrawal timetable from the US, not because it believes that Iraqi forces will be ready to take over soon, but to burnish its nationalist credentials ahead of next year's parliamentary elections. In this way it hopes to divert public attention from still nonexistent basic services, continuing sectarianism, weak oil production, scant infrastructure investment, and rampant corruption and cronyism. Whether this strategy will succeed in obscuring the government's record of failure in the minds of voters remains to be seen. </p> <p>The problem now for Iraqi and US politicians is that, to act rationally, they will need to face down elements within their own constituencies. They must recognize that a long-term presence by US troops is out of the question, but that US combat forces will be needed in Iraq \u2013 albeit with a diminishing role \u2013 for the next five years. Only such a presence can consolidate the palpable, but still reversible, gains made over the past year. </p> <p>Such a force is needed to continue pursuing al-Qaida, and to counteract pro-Iranian activities. Ending US involvement before the Iraqis can achieve these goals on their own would be disastrous for both US and Iraqi interests. In the meantime, US forces must support Iraqi efforts to strengthen the country's own military and security forces, while simultaneously disbanding all militias. </p> <p>Iraq's militias will not go quietly, yet their dissolution is essential for long-term stability, itself a sine qua non for stability in the region. When these missions are accomplished \u2013 but not sooner \u2013 US forces should withdraw from Iraq. </p> <p>\u0095 Feisal Amin Rasoul al-Istrabadi served as Iraq's ambassador and deputy permanent representative to the United Nations from 2004 to 2007.

  "<p>After yesterday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/18/cricket-indiacricketteam\">momentous scenes</a>, India got back to the business of trying to win a Test match by taking control on day two of the second Test against Australia in Mohali. Sourav Ganguly hit a century, and Test debutant Amit Mishra took two wickets as India turned the screw on their Australian visitors.</p> <p>Ganguly hit a magnificent 102 \u2014 and put on 109 runs for the seventh wicket with Mahendra Singh Dhoni (92) \u2014 as India were bowled out for 469 just before tea. Zaheer Khan then gave India a flying start with the ball, bowling Matthew Hayden for a duck via an inside edge.</p> <p>Ishant Sharma dismissed Ricky Ponting for just five while leg-spinner Mishra snared Simon Katich for 33. Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey propped up the innings with a 40-run fourth-wicket stand, but Mishra struck again to dismiss Clarke for 23 with the final ball of the day. Australia closed on 102 for four, trailing by 367 runs heading into day three. Hussey was unbeaten on 37 at stumps.</p> <p>At 311 for five, Ganguly began the day cautiously alongside night watchman Ishant, contributing just 15 runs to India's total in the first hour of play. Ishant (nine) looked in better touch before Peter Siddle got him to fend off a short delivery straight into the hands of Katich at leg gully.</p> <p>Ganguly's timing and precision, which deserted the left-hander in the morning, returned as he brought up his 16th Test century by tucking leg spinner Cameron White for a boundary to square leg. He departed soon after though, charging out prematurely to hoist White over the ropes, but only holing out to Brett Lee at mid-off as the bowler fired his delivery short and wide.</p> <p>Dhoni then took centre stage, hammering a total of eight boundaries and four sixes \u2014 two off Siddle and White apiece \u2014 as he charged into the 90s. Dhoni, however, fell to a doubtful lbw decision from Rudi Koertzen eight runs short of a second Test hundred. Replays indicated Dhoni had inside-edged on to pads even while being struck well outside the line of off stump. But the dismissal stood as Siddle and White finished with three wickets apiece.</p> <p>The tourists' reply began in abysmal fashion as Zaheer snapped up the wicket of Hayden with only the third delivery of the innings, while Ishant had Australia skipper Ponting trapped in front in the eighth over to leave Australia reeling.</p> <p>Hussey and Katich lived dangerously as they worked to prop up Australia's sagging innings. Zaheer had gone past the edge of Hussey and the batsman enjoyed another slice of luck when an edge off Ishant dropped safely between Rahul Dravid and Dhoni.</p> <p>The India spinners were pressed into service and Mishra responded with the wicket of Katich, who reached forward to prod at a delivery but only managed to edge the ball on to his leg stump. Harbhajan Singh was left frustrated when an edge from Hussey was put down by Dhoni with the batsman on just 21.</p> <p>Clarke and Hussey lifted the Australia innings with their 40-run partnership but that ended when Mishra trapped the former in front with a straight delivery.</p>",

  "<p>The number of migrants coming into the UK must be curbed and subject to strict limitations because of the economic crisis, according to the immigration minister Phil Woolas.</p> <p>The increasingly tough economic conditions and people losing their jobs made the immigration issue \"extremely thorny\", he told the Times.

  "<p>OK. I screwed up. Lots of people didn't understand the argument I was making in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2008/oct/16/religion-family\">the last post about religion and American politics</a>. That is clearly my fault. Let me try again.</p> <p>One of the things that confuses European (and American) liberals about American voting patterns is that large sections of the working class seem to vote against their own interest. This was the theme of Thomas Frank's book <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/22796\"><em>What's the Matter with Kansas</em></a>, and has been widely accepted, (except <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/%7ebartels/kansas.pdf\">among political scientists</a>). In particular, the American poor will vote for policies that will impoverish the poor and enrich the rich, providing these are wrapped in social conservatism and religious or family values.</p> <p>George Packer's <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/10/13/081013fa_fact_packer\"><em>New Yorker </em>piece</a> about poor voters in Ohio certainly showed they would benefit from more left-wing or socialist economic policies: proper health care, unemployment insurance, job security and so on. </p> <p>[I know that at this point I have lost all the American right-wing readers; but bear with me. I need to upset the left-wingers as well before the end of the argument.]</p> <p>However, the story of Carrie Snodgrass also showed that it is not just economic or political oppression keeping people poor: it is also very widespread family breakdown (as it happens, here, among white working classes). </p> <p>This suggests a reason why such people might vote Republican, or \"family values\" even though this would worsen their economic situation: they reckon that getting and staying married, or in general behaving in a trustworthy and moral way, and living among people who do the same, will increase their well-being in ways over which they have some control. This is more important, or more likely to succeed, than trusting others (politicians), over whom they have no control, to take the necessary political steps to improve their lives. </p> <p>Therefore it can appear a perfectly sensible bet to vote republican, or social conservative, even though it will lead to a starving of public investment and still greater inequality. If family life is yet another thing that rich people get and poor ones don't then it's perfectly reasonable to say that it is the most important of all those things, and to vote for the people who promise, however mendaciously, to strengthen it. </p> <p>That was the argument I was trying to make earlier. I hope it is clearer now. I should perhaps add the standard disclaimer that I am not saying voting to the Right is the right choice for the poor. I merely want to see if it is a comprehensible one, assuming reasonable self-interest.</p>",

Rooney, Giggs and Ronaldo have all enjoyed plenty of ball in and around the area, not that Carson has had to make too many saves. West Brom will continue to be content with a staunch display.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> United win a couple of corners, but nothing comes of them. Nobody really seems that fussed, either. Have I been spiked with ketamine?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>36 min: </strong> Evra goes off to be replaced by O'Shea. He's injured, though I'm not sure what's up with him. Maybe he's been spiked with ketamine.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 min: </strong> Rooney picks the ball up in the West Brom area eight yards out. He tries to turn but Donk is right at his back, and eventually Morrison comes in to whisk the ball away from danger. \"You'd be as livid as Giggs (22 min),\" begins Mac Millings, \"if your team had been disallowed a goal in direct opposition to Law 41.1 (b): 'If a goal is scored after an infringement, the goal is to be disallowed in all circumstances other than when scored by the home side at Old Trafford.' A perplexing decision by the official. This is surely one for the next You are the Ref.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min: </strong> Zuiverloon is booked for upending Ronaldo. That's after a United move has been allowed to continue down the pitch, resulting in a corner on the left. From it, Ferdinand and Robinson contest a high ball at the far post: Robinson bundles the ball out of play, having done so (according to Ferdinand) with his hand. The ref is having none of it. The resulting corner is met by the head of Vidic, but his effort from ten yards is blocked and bounds out of the area.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min: BERBATOV TOUCHES THE BALL!</strong> Yes, he really did touch it!</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Giggs swings a ball into the area from the left. Park races in from the right, attempting to meet it with his head but only achieving the bowling over of Robinson. There will be one more minute of this half, which if in any way similar to the preceding 45, will seem like an hour.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: An exceptionally soporific Manchester United 0-0 A determined West Bromwich Albion.</strong> Ssh, don't make a sound, Old Trafford's sleeping. Let's wake everyone up in 15.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Wakey wakey, rise and shine!</strong> And we're off again. So, OK, this can't be as laid back a half of football as the one just gone. Can it? West Brom get the ball rolling. And lose it within three seconds. The only way is up.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> A lot of pointless passing. West Brom's shirts, by the way, are a work of art. This is mainly down to the lack of sponsor on the front, but the shirts are a nice, simple design anyway, with no needless flourishes or unnecessary flashes of colour. Umbro should be congratulated for that, as usually sports clothing companies do their level best to bugger everything up.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Morrison cuts inside from the right, rolls the ball to Valero, who feeds Brunt on the edge of the area. Brunt tries to curl it into the top-left corner, but only just manages to keep it inside the top-left corner of the stadium. That was one of West Brom's few sorties upfield, and a decent one at that.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Some hapless heading by Olsson on the edge of his own area allows O'Shea to slip the ball to Rooney - who absolutely <em>welts</em> the ball goalwards. His shot is parried spectacularly by Carson, though the keeper would have been disappointed had he not got a hand to it. Still, decent football all round. Will this give United a much-needed boost?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Miller comes on for Bednar.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> United do appear to be much more up for this now. Park bustles straight down the centre of the park, the ball breaking to Berbatov just outside the area. He takes a fair old whack at the ball, but only straight at Carson.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>56 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 1-0 West Bromwich Albion.</strong> A great finish from Rooney, who races down the inside left channel, cuts inside past Donk, and wrongfoots Carson with a hard, low effort into the bottom-left corner. That had been coming since the restart.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Miller works a lovely one-two with Morrison on the edge of the United area. He makes the return just by the byline, but slips as he crosses, the ball sailing sweetly into Van der Sar's hands. Pretty harmless in the end, but promising for West Brom nonetheless, who aren't out of it quite yet.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Giggs slips a ball straight into the area along the floor. Rooney, brimming with confidence at the moment, takes a shot first time towards the bottom right. Carson does well to turn it round the post - though it might have been going wide anyway. The corner is, yes, you guessed it.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Valero drags and shimmies in the centre of the pitch awhile, eventually attempting to slip Morrison free down the right. The ball's too heavy and possession is lost, but Valero looks like a very decent player indeed. Meanwhile Vijayant Singh is watching the game in India: \"I think this a not a football game but a Test Cricket match between West Indies(which- after looking at an atlas for 28752875 hours- is not a country!!!) and losers England. P.S Man Utd are going to lose 4-0 all goals being ronaldo own goals. P.P.S The new Oasis album is mint. Ha.\" That's possibly the most gloriously unhinged email ever sent to the MBM (although he was going so well until he mentioned Oasis).</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Gary Neville comes on for Rafael.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> A lot of pointless passing again. \"I'm no good at this prediction lark, am I?\" asks Chris B, who before the match reckoned we would see a Bednar goal disallowed for a dubious offside, a penalty for United which wasn't, the sending off of either Robinson or Olsson, or both, and a United goalfest. No, Chris, no you're not. Though you are better than Vijayant Singh, I'll give you that. \"We could still get slaughtered, though.\" That is true.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>69 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 2-0 West Bromwich Albion.</strong> Will this make Chris B feel better about himself? No. A simple goal this, Rooney sliding a ball straight down the centre of the pitch for Ronaldo, who loses Olsson easily and slips a shot past the advancing Carson.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>71 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 3-0 West Bromwich Albion.</strong> Oh Chris B, what have you said? Nani, who has just come on for Park, sends a fairly poor cross in from the left. But it bounces under the flat feet of Olsson, and finds Berbatov, six yards out and unmarked. He prods the ball past Carson and has the class to look vaguely embarrassed for Olsson and West Brom.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Nani, Rooney, Berbatov and Ronaldo are just showing off now.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> They're still showing off.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> West Brom enjoy a minute or so in United's half, stroking it around the centre circle with aplomb. They can't get it forward, though, the ball eventually being lost when Morrison goes on a charge down the left.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> United win a free kick just to the right of the West Brom area. Giggs stands over it and decides to take a thrash at goal himself. It's terrible, sailing high wide right. By the way, Moore came on for Koren nine minutes ago.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> See 81 minutes, except this time Giggs sends it flying right across the face of goal and out of play on the left. And Moore now came on for Koren 11 minutes ago.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> We're done here. \"I still say that United will get a dubious penalty from Ronaldo diving,\" insists Aidan Gibson.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ronaldo slips the ball into the box towards Berbatov, who looks like getting to it first but is stymied by Donk, who gets a toe in at the last minute. West Brom have kept going here.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Wow, Miller is <em>this</em> much away from scoring a spectacular goal. He cuts inside from the right and unleashes a wonderful rising shot towards the top-left corner. Van der Sar was beaten - just - but the ball driftes milimetres wide of the left-hand post. So unlucky.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> United are fannying around in the West Brom half - \"Now they really are taking the piss,\" opines Setanta's Craig Burley, the last word sticking in his throat as he realises what he's saying - when the ball breaks to Miller. He powers down the pitch and into the United area - but with Giggs tracking back can only shoot straight at Van der Sar. A strong showing at the end from Miller, this, though.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 min: GOAL!!! Manchester United 4-0 West Bromwich Albion.</strong> Berbatov rolls the ball out right to Rooney, who trundles it across the face of goal for Nani to sidefoot home. So simple. United have been the dominant side, no question, but West Brom don't deserve a tonking.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>FINAL SCORE: Manchester United 4-0 West Bromwich Albion.</strong> That was a pretty terrible first-half performance by United, followed by a very impressive second-half one. West Brom were impressive in fits and bursts, though, and should be givencredit for their efforts. Ultimately, though, there was only ever going to be one winner. United are now ahead of Hull City on goal difference. Well done, United! Ah, hold on, here's some last-minute abuse coming my way, courtesy of Dave Cook: \"Greatest kit of all time? Sorry, but you're wrong. The blue and white home kit is the second greatest kit of all time. The yellow and green striped away kit of the same season beats it. Ah, well. At least we didn't get gubbed out of sight.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Today's kick off at the Riverside is 12.45pm. Some things will be written here from about 12.30pm onwards.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Some team news:</strong></p> <p><strong>Middlesbrough</strong>: Turnbull, Grounds, Wheater, Riggott, Taylor, Aliadiere, Shawky, O'Neil, Adam Johnson, Downing, Mido. Subs:<br>Jones, Digard, Emnes, Alves, Bennett, John Johnson, Walker.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea</strong>: Cudicini, Bosingwa, Terry, Alex, Bridge, Belletti, Lampard, Mikel, Kalou, Anelka, Malouda. Subs: Hilario, Ivanovic, Sinclair, Ferreira, Deco, Mancienne, Stoch.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Good lunchtime all and welcome to the Riverside Stadium</strong>, Middlesbrough, where chart-toppers Chelsea are this afternoon's visitors. They're \"injury ravaged\" today, with Carlo Cudicini in goal, Deco only on the bench, Joe and Kazakhstan's Ashley Cole out, joining Ricardo Carvahlo, Michael Essien, Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba rattling around the stands. Or at home. But England's Brave John Terry returns after a bout of back-knack kept him from being brave against Belarus and Kazakhstan for his country, and Alex has recovered from buttock gah to partner EBJT at centre back.</p> <p>To put this into perspective a little, Justin Hoyte is missing for Middlesbrough, meaning Jonathan Grounds plays, and Adam Johnson starts ahead of Afonso Alves. Mido leads the line in a team that features six of their academy graduates.</p> <p><strong>Pre-match research:</strong> The Guardian's match-pointers say that Middlesbrough have yet to concede a goal in the first half of a match this season, that they are two goals short of 6,000 in league football, and that a win for Boro would take them to 100 under Gareth Southgate. <strong>Prediction department:</strong> <em>One</em> of these records will be broken this afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Department of irrelevancy:</strong> \"Chelsea's striker Didier Drogba is more prolific against Boro (six goals in seven appearances) than he is against any other side.\" <strong>Department of more pertinency:</strong> Didier Drogba's knee injury is expected to keep him out of action until Novemer 9.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Jeff Stelling started his Super Saturday introduction</strong> with a cough and a smile and something like: \"Here's the <em>countdown</em> to today's football.\" But he's not going to be cuddling up to Susie Dent anytime soon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/17/channel4-television\">since Alexander Armstrong is going to be feeling the housewives' love</a> on the popular daytime Channel 4 gameshow.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Gary Naylor is back from the international break</strong> with renewed enthusiasm: \"Older readers will have read your team news and done an Oliver Hardyesque double-take on seeing 'Sinclair' amongst the Chelsea subs, thinking 'Frank'? Alas, it's not the own goal specialist of the 90s - no room for such eccentricities in the ruthless Stamford Bridge machine any more. In a way, football is diminished as a result.\" True, true, but as Gary no doubt knows this is Scott Sinclair, the speedy forward, who some old-school fans are hailing as a potential saviour of the English club Chelsea FC.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> And away we go, with Chelsea finding Salomon Kalou on the right, who tees up Bosingwa to hoist the first cross into the box. It goes behind Andy Turnbull's goal, and Boro touch the ball.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Belletti is the subject of the early commentary-box witterings, about whether or not he's playing the holding role or pushing forward. The latter seems to be the consensus. For Boro, Aliadiere is playing up front with Mido.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 mins: </strong>Adam Johnson doesn't so much skin Wayne Bridge down the right as ambles past the England left-back, who totters over. Johnson lays his cross into a dangerous area on the edge of the box, where none of his colleagues have gone.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Boro allow Chelsea plenty of the ball in midfield and are defending deep. Chelsea over-egg it and the Boro backline copes. Nicolas Anelka then has a scurry in the inside right, but Wheater shepherds to safety.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> Malouda is left alone to weave into shooting distance, but doesn't see the run of either Belletti or Kalou and instead runs into Chris Riggott.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> Bosingwa, striding across the half-way line, is double-teamed by the Boro defenders, with a foul and a talking to going to Andrew Taylor from Phil Dowd. Lampard lifts the free-kick into the box, but Mido muscles Alex out of it.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> First sniff of danger from Boro: Mido is fouled 30 yards out which is improbably described as \"Downing range\" by Andy Gray. Some hope. Sure enough, the free-kick is booted into the wall, skews up and into the grateful arms of Carlo Cudicini.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins: GOAL! Middlesbrough 0-1 Chelsea</strong><br>So that's Middlesbrough's first-half goal conceding record broken. Bridge is played in down the left, he puts a great cross over into the middle that Wheater can only head as far as Belletti. His shot is blocked straight into the path of Kalou, who side-foots past Turnbull for an easy opener. Terrific build-up play, scrappy finish, but 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 mins: </strong>Far too much space here for Chelsea in the middle and - counterintuitively - down the flanks as well. Bridge scampers into acres on the left wing and is played in again. This time Malouda can't control the cross adequately and the danger evaporates.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 mins: </strong>Lampard invites Bosingwa into the attack down the right and he spins around his marker before Taylor finally gets a foot in. Then Kalou pops up in another huge gap on the right corner of the Boro box and fires a low shot goalward. He doesn't connect with particular venom and Turnbull stops.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 mins:</strong> Mido's dropping deep to find the ball and, in this instance, give it away immediately with a dreadful ball that attempts to find Downing on the left and gets nowhere near him whatsoever. Roger Federer breaks Andy Murray in Madrid.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>23 mins:</strong> This is all a bit pathetic up front from Boro, and Mido in particular, who now fails to spot Downing in plenty of room down the left and opts to chip over the middle to no one.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> Comical miss from Frank Lampard, who misses a gaping goal from three yards out when he's picked out with a simple square ball from Kalou, who is once again free on the inside right. The defender lunges in and apparently gets a touch because it goes for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Gary O'Neil is booked for playing football. There's not anything amiss with his tackle on Alex, but Dowd doesn't like it and flashes yellow. Belletti dinks a threatening ball over the static Boro backline, who are grateful to see a linesman's flag shown to the dawdling Chelsea forwards.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 mins: </strong>Anelka is this time all alone on the right, but can't beat the first man with a cross and 'wins' a corner instead. That's wasted by Lampard. \"Boro's keeper rejoices in the moniker 'Andy Turnbull'\" overstates Gary Naylor. \"That's rather too close to \"Wendy Turnbull\", erstwhile bastion of evening doubles at Wimbledon. There was a time when all female tennis players looked like Wendy Turnbull, which is to say, like Andy Turnbull and not like Andie McDowell. I think.\" I don't know what that's all about, but this game is not a thriller as yet.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 mins:</strong> Downing's persistence wins a corner on the left but then undoes all his good work - and then some - when he kicks at thin air after the corner is dragged back to him on the edge of the box. At the other end, Malouda squanders his own good chance when he has hours to line up a shot on the left corner and drags it wide of the right post.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 mins:</strong> Chelsea's reserves have had all the possession here and are merely stroking it around midfield as Boro continue to drop off. In their attempt to get forward, Boro are consistently aiming at the so-far ineffective Mido, who does very little indeed.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Chelsea try to find Malouda buzzing in the centre, but Wheater clears. That only invites another wave of effortless ambling forward by Chelsea which ends with Anelka and Kalou conspiring to produce pretty patterns but no end product on the right.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Corner for Chelsea, which Lampard lifts to the near post. It's headed clear, but only to Malouda on the edge of the box, who thunders one over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> This has all the urgency of a training game and Chelsea are only really beating themselves, this time Anelka darting too hastily down the right and deemed offside. But Boro aren't getting anywhere near their opponents here and are allowing ridiculous amounts of space for the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> More room down the left for Wayne Bridge, whose low cross is cut out ahead of Anelka. But the pressure stays on and Chelsea have a corner, which eventually screws to Malouda on the edge of the box. His shot is charged down.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> Gareth Southgate is going to need to give some articulate hairdrying at half time as Boro have been woefully leaden-footed this half. Their best chance actually comes right at the end of the half when a half-arsed back-pass almost catches out Cudicini, but he clears.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Jamie Redknapp.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time 'analysis':</strong> Boro: really slow and casual. Chelsea: slightly less slow and casual. In truth the visitors could be three or four to the good here if they'd thought they needed to be. But at the moment it's alarmingly pedestrian for the best league in the world\u2122.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>End of half time:</strong> I have high hopes for this second half, if only to rescue some kind of meaning from this afternoon's work. But Boro are really going to need to turn up the urgency lest this one become one very drab footnote to their season and my career. And here they come, sauntering back onto the pitch. Andy Murray has won the second set against Roger Federer, if that's your bag. Federer won the first.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> Tempo is not just an Italian car. In fact, I'm not sure it's even an Italian car, but the point is that \"Tempo\" was the buzzword at the break and Middlesbrough need to up it. Two minutes in, Downing gets a hearty round of applause for rasping one yards over the bar. That was already an improvement, which says much.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Free kick for Boro on the left is plucked out the air by Cudicini. But in the blink of an eye Chelsea go right up the other end, Arsenal-like, and have a gilt-edged chance to double the lead. The 'keeper's throw is horribly misjudged by Grounds at right back, allowing Kalou a free run on goal. Turnbull comes out but the Chelsea forward beats both him and the left post. That should definitely be 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 mins: And <em>THAT</em> is 2-0. Goal! Middlesbrough 0-2 Chelsea</strong><br>The ball finds its way to Belletti in the middle of the pitch 30 yards from goal. The Brazilian looks up, sees nothing but the top right-hand corner of the net, and simply larrups it right there, past Ross Turnbull's despairing dive. Brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 mins: Goal! Middlesbrough 0-3 Chelsea</strong><br>And that's that. Long ball from Bridge finds Malouda deep into the Boro box. His knock-back richochets off Wheater and Kalou stabs it past Turnbull for 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Jonathan Grounds is subbed, with John Johnson (or John Johnson, J, according to our match facts) replacing him. Boro have a sniff of goal when Aliadiere gets a shot in despite the attentions of three defenders, but Cudicini saves comfortably. \"Belletti spoons over\" I hear on my headphones, but missed this spooning.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Boro are rubbish today, and now can't even play a three yard pass to each other in the comfort of their own half. Chelsea are the ones who have upped the pace and are now swarming forward. There might yet be five or so here.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>61 mins:</strong> Lampard drives one in low, saved by Turnbull, after Wheater struggles to contain Anelka on the edge of the box and ends up teeing up the England midfielder. Andy Murray squanders three break points against Federer and that's now 2-2 in the final set.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>64 mins: Goal! Middlesbrough 0-4 Chelsea</strong><br>Boro need to be put out of their misery here as this is an embarrassment. The fourth goal is a beautiful flowing move from Chelsea, ended when Kalou stands one up in the box for an unmarked Lampard to head past Turnbull. The problem for Boro is that the move also contains passes from two of their players - a hopeless header from Taylor, then a misplaced 'tackle' from the otherwise anonymous Shawky. Anelka provides the other crucial touch to put in Kalou.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>67 mins: Goal! Middlesbrough 0-5 Chelsea</strong> Yep, five. Anelka has acres on the left, he cuts in on his right foot and unleashes a low drive that Ross Turnbull scoops ridiculously through him and onto the post. It pings out to Malouda to tap into the open goal. There have been loads of substitutions too, but I haven't caught up.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> And that one is disallowed, although it doesn't excuse more completely hopeless 'defending' from the home side who give the ball away again, allow Malouda free down the left, and free on goal. Instead of just scoring himself, which he could have, he elects to play in Anelka. He duly slots it into the net but is offside and we stay at five.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 mins:</strong> Side netting from Lampard. He takes a swipe from 20 yards after everyone backs off, again. I can't remember a more one-sided match than this in a long, long while.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> This substitution I did notice: Frank Lampard is replaced by Deco, who is given the perfect chance to prove his return to fitness against this pub side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Good save from Turnbull prevents a sixth, although he's going to be furious with his defenders for that. Yet again, they give Chelsea hours in midfield, Deco picks out a slide-rule pass to Anelka, scampering forward, and his shot across Turnbull is saved one-handed.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>78 mins:</strong> A shot for Boro! Yes, it's closer to the corner flag than the goal from Mido, who wriggles free of the defenders' attentions and fires it in left footed. But let's not forget the facts: A shot for Boro! Scott Sinclair replaces Anelka.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Afonso Alves, who is one of those subs I missed, is fouled by Bosingwa three yards out of the box, wide left. Alves takes it himself, thumps it into the wall, then Downing finishes the job and thumps it high and wide from the rebound. The sparse Boro crowd trickle home.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 mins:</strong> Credit where it's due, even if it's 85 minutes too late and ultimately ineffective, but Boro have some sustained pressure. At the other end, Kalou goes in search of his hattrick, but sends an ambitious shot over the top.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> OK, time for a quick assessment of this: are Boro that bad, or are Chelsea that good? Well, the first half was mediocre from both, with the visitors barely needing to get out of second gear to go 1-0 up. The second half, though, made it look like the early tactics of dropping deep and slowing the pace were right all along: the minute Boro forced Chelsea to up the tempo, they were humiliated. There were a number of blunders from inexperienced players which didn't help at all, but Chelsea were effortlessly better than a pretty abject home team. I didn't answer my own question, did I.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 mins: </strong>Chelsea killing time by revisiting the heady days of the first half, when they were casually stroking the ball among themselves with scarcely a threat from Boro. They win a corner, with which they toy around by the byeline, and this is dribbling to a close.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90+1 mins: </strong>The same, and then more of the same.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Chelsea have another corner right at the death but sensibly, I suppose, engage in some keep-ball instead of hoisting it into the middle. Then the whistle puts Boro out of their misery - and you won't see a more emphatic victory than that all season.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Full-time+1</strong> Chelsea consolidate their lead at the top of the Premier League, although Liverpool can overtake them provided they beat Wigan by 11 clear goals this afternoon. Make a point of seeing Belletti's goal on telly tonight. But that's it from here. Bye.</p>",
  "<p>Day 6. Talking to people and watching the media as we make our way across the Southwest, it sometimes feels as if the election is over and Barack Obama has nothing left to do but pack up for his move to the White House. Even as the Democratic nominee warns his legions not to get complacent, John McCain already looks like a sour old loser. Sarah Palin, once the emblem of right-wing populism, is all but invisible to anyone but the crowds who appear at her increasingly virulent rallies; about the only thing that can save her from oblivion is tonight's appearance on Saturday Night Live. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com\">Fivethirtyeight.com</a>, the hot projections site, is today projecting a veritable Obama landslide: 56.6 to 41.4 percent in the popular vote and 349.2 to 188.8 in the electoral college. It also says that Democrats could come out with a 15-seat lead in the Senate. RealClearPolitics, which averages all the national polls, is showing Obama with a more modest 6.9 point lead, but a stronger advantage in the electoral college. States like North Carolina and Nevada and even West Virginia, which McCain should have locked up long ago, are now classified as toss-ups. Four key states that Bush won last time\u2014Iowa, Virginia, Colorado, and New Mexico\u2014are at least leaning Democratic. </p> <p>In these and other swing states, Obama's disciplined ranks of youthful activists have invaded town after town. No one has seen this sort of political mobilization since the New Right rose to power in the Reagan Revolution in 1980.<br> Last night, after a 350-mile drive across the high desert from Sedona, Arizona, we entered the capital of the swing state among swing states: Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2004, George W. Bush beat John Kerry here by just under 6,000 votes. In 2000, Al Gore beat Bush by only 366 votes. Before that, the state went for Clinton in his winning years, and George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan in theirs. According to RCP, Obama is now leading here by just over 8 points. </p> <p>The partisan breakdown varies wildly in different parts of the state: Down in the southeastern corner, on the Texas border, the Republican share of the vote can run as high as 70 to 80%; in the northern mountains, around wealthy, New Age Taos, the split is just the opposite. Bernalillo County, where we are now, is the most populous in the state, with more than 600,000 residents. It is also key to Obama's strategy this year. The campaign's aim is to run up such wide margins here (15,000-20,000) that McCain can't catch him even if he does well further south. And the Democrats aren't conceding the south, either, as Joe Biden arrived in the state for a rally down in Mesilla.</p> <p>Joe Monahan, the savvy local blog editor who runs <a href=\"http://www.joemonahansnewmexico.blogspot.com/\">New Mexico Politics with Joe Monahan</a>, points out the Latinos make up a substantial slice of the population in New Mexico, some 44%. They are trending strongly toward Obama, but <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-newmexico16-2008oct16,0,3999043.story\u2014by \">a fifth remain undecided some accounts</a>, because of the conflict between progressive economic positions and conservative social views. The GOP's position in this community wasn't helped by the unexpected demise of Bernalillo County Republican Party chairman Fernando C. de Baca, who stepped down last month after telling a BBC reporter: \"The truth is that Hispanics came here as conquerors. African-Americans came here as slaves. Hispanics consider themselves above blacks. They won't vote for a black president.\" </p> <p>Native Americans are a higher percentage of the total here than in any other state, though still only about 10%. With margins as small as they have been in recent years, however, the <a href=\"http://nativetimes.bizweb5.tulsaconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=195&amp;Itemid=28\">Native American vote could make a difference</a>. They usually voting in low numbers, but Obama has opened a campaign office on the Navajo reservation, and more near Pueblo and other Indian communities, and has won the endorsement of many tribal leaders. </p> <p>There is a solid McCain vote among those who work for Sandia Laboratories and on Kirkland Air Force base, and in much of the south, Joe Monahan says--but even there, cracks have appeared in a once-reliable Republican base. And the Democrats have registered some 35,000 new voters, far outstripping the Republicans\u2014though the \"voting fraud\" challenges have already begun here, as they have in other battleground states. (I'll be writing more vote about suppression tactics in New Mexico tomorrow.)</p> <p>All this may explain why the GOP is flying in Sarah Palin, who is to appear on Sunday at an airport hangar in Roswell. Maybe she can put things back together again, or at the very least stem the Obama tide. Roswell is of course notorious as the site of a supposed UFO crash in 1947, that left behind spaceship debris and alien corpses. (The U.S. military said the debris was from an experimental surveillance balloon, but believers insist this was a cover story.) </p> <p>With our editors working late into the night, we'll be posting two new videos tomorrow. Part of our team has already headed out for Colorado Springs, to take a look at its famous evangelical Christian community, and the rest of us will be following tomorrow, north on Route 25. But along the way we'll be stopping off in Santa Fe and some smaller towns, to check out the rallies and marches taking place all over New Mexico, aimed at getting people to take part in early voting, which begins tomorrow in locations all over the state.</p>",
  "<p>There's a mood of anxious euphoria among <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/\">Scottish National Party</a> <br>supporters as they make their way to Perth for their annual <br>conference this weekend. Triumphalism at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East byelection</a> victory has been laced with concern that the economic landscape has changed out of all recognition since July. Yesterday, the Irish government introduced an austerity package of tax increases that underlined the extent to which the Celtic Tiger economy, which the SNP has always held up as the model for an independent Scotland, is not what it was. </p> <p>Mind you, neither is the UK economy. Austerity is likely to be <br>the name of the game in Britain too now that the public accounts have been shredded by the banking bail-out. Ireland has a fiscal <br>deficit of 6.5%, double the Maastricht limit, and Britain is heading <br>exactly the same way. The immediate presentational problem remains with the SNP, however, since the predominantly unionist Scottish press has been <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/opinion/Why-global-crisis-has-left.4602208.jp\">quick to point</a> to Ireland and Iceland as salutary lessons in the folly of separatism. What Alex Salmond has to do this weekend is persuade Scots that an independent Scotland would not end up like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/iceland\">Iceland</a> \u2013 bankrupt, alone and waving the begging bowl at Russia.</p> <p>Actually, there's a lot of residual sympathy in Perth for the <br>Icelanders, a rugged, independently minded people used to adversity. <br>Questions are being raised, and will be raised further as the weekend <br>progresses, about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/10/iceland-gordonbrown\">heavy-handed way</a> the UK handled the Iceland default, employing anti-terrorist legislation to seize banking assets. There is a suspicion that Gordon Brown may have been hoping to make an example of Iceland \"pour encourager les autres\".</p> <p>Over the weekend, SNP leaders intend to come out fighting on <br>behalf of all the small northern European countries that the Labour <br>Scottish secretary Jim Murphy has labelled the \"arc of insolvency\". He will be accused of insulting Scotland's neighbours, and failing to <br>note how Norway's \u00a3200bn oil fund has functioned as an economic <br>stabiliser. The SNP has called for a similar oil fund in Scotland. <br>Not that it would be worth quite as much as a few months ago. The <br>collapse in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/oil\">price of oil</a> to less than $70 a barrel blows another hole in the Scottish accounts, according to Labour.</p> <p>Some nationalists could be forgiven for consoling themselves with traditional Scottish fatalism. Just our luck, they'll be saying over a dram. Scotland finally elects a nationalist government, wins huge public support, and what happens? The greatest financial crisis in 80 years. You couldn't make it up.</p>",
  "<blockquote> <p>Brothers, drink and chime in / All sinners shall be forgiven / And hell shall be no more.</p> </blockquote> <p>The author of this fine sentiment, Friedrich Schiller, was until recently one of numerous European citizens presumed guilty until proven innocent, the guilt in question attaching to his non-payment of his TV licence. When one of the long-dead poet's living representatives \u2013 in this case the headmaster of the school bearing his name \u2013 pointed out that while Schiller was now in position to confirm the extent to which sinners have been forgiven and hell cancelled, he was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/germany.theatre\">definitely in no position</a> to watch a television, the German TV licensing authority withdrew the demand. </p> <p>Schiller's conception of joy and spiritual elation \u2013 as expressed in the celebrated Ode and <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6798\">elaborated further</a> in the Lectures on the Aesthetic Education of Man \u2013 was of an infectious moral force. While his analytical gaze was fixed for the most part on the redemptive power of art and love, he might well have subscribed to my own view that the humble smile \u2013 wielded modestly at the unsuspecting passerby \u2013 can bring about a wholesale uplifting of a nation's spirits. In a manner not dissimilar to the <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory\">theory of chaos</a>, it seems reasonable to suppose that a casual smile in Battersea can lead to an marriage in Bolton and a spontaneous street party in Tunbridge Wells (well, if a theory isn't far-fetched, it's unworthy of the name).</p> <p>But if the theory works in one direction, it definitely works in the other. And there are few encounters more certain to send the ambient spirits plummeting into FTSE-style freefall than a fresh advertising campaign by our own TV licensing authority. </p> <p>To say this body's advertising record has been chequered is to imagine a board of uniformly dark squares. Many will remember the \"We know where you live\" campaign with which the authority chose to see in the new millennium, in one instance alerting the orthodox Jewish, strict non-TV watching residents of Broom Lane in Manchester to the existence of unpaid licences in their street. The BBC apologised, though in no way profusely. </p> <p>Now again, precisely the same tone is in evidence in the poster campaign launched this month. The <a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2925103783_59a2063c22_b.jpg\">poster in question</a>, which shows what looks like a crepuscular cityscape, with tower blocks, parks, and well-ordered streets, but which is in fact a close-up of a computer circuit board, informs us that: \"London is in our database. Evaders will pay.\"</p> <p>The Inland Revenue is responsible for the collection of money innumerably more necessary to the wellbeing of citizens than that hauled in by the BBC's private pit-bull terrier. Yet if the taxman were to conduct himself in this fashion, there would be a national uprising, and justly so. But never mind that. Never mind, too, the creeping evidence from every quarter that the tired, offensive analogy between human life and information technology is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. As Schiller put it, lamenting the creeping reduction of human spirituality to what would now be called information processing: </p> <blockquote> <p>Material needs reign supreme and bend a degraded humanity beneath their tyrannical yoke. Utility is the great idol of our age, to which all powers are in thrall and to which all talent must pay homage.</p> </blockquote> <p>But never mind this. Never mind too the fact that, despite the complete absence of references to the BBC and its otherwise ubiquitous logo on any of its advertising or official material, the TV licensing authority is in no way independent of the BBC \u2013 the nation's friendly \"auntie\" \u2013 having been a virtual body contracted exclusively to and funded directly by the organisation since 1991. Never mind the fact that, at a cost in the year 2007/8 of \u00a3121.6m, a full 3.6% of the money collected from licences (and well over half the total radio budget) is spent on enforcement and collection. Never mind the fact an authority funded exclusively from public funds retains levels of secrecy about the detection technology it employs (or maybe doesn't) that put MI5 to shame. As their spokesperson put it to me: </p> <blockquote> <p>Enquiry officers do also have access to detection equipment such as the vans and the new, hi-tech handheld detectors although TV Licensing never reveals exactly how this technology works, because we don't want to give helpful information to people who are considering breaking the law. </p> </blockquote> <p>Never mind all these things. Not because they are not important. They are, manifestly so. But never mind them now because they all pale into comparison besides the routinely aggressive, plain antisocial nature both of the advertising and the bullying letters which terrorise the few members of our society who prefer to live their lives rather than gawp at the lives of others. </p> <p>The question arises, therefore, of whether the cause of this needless aggravation is itself needless. As luck would have it, the BBC are asking <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/consult/open_consultations/tv_licence.html\">this question themselves</a>, having recently opened a consultation \u2013 albeit not a very far-reaching one \u2013 on the future of the TV licence. </p> <p>To my mind, the issue is relatively simple. When the switch of the digital switchover is finally thrown in 2012, can we not simply move over to a system like that of Sky, which requires one to pay before the being able to receive a signal at all?</p> <p>As for the pointless aggravation, suspicious finger-pointing and plain anger peddled by a public service organisation whose raison d'etre is supposed to be education and entertainment \u2013 put simply, we don't need it.</p> <p>So while the consultation is on, stand up and be consulted. Please do. After all, they know where you live already.</p>"
