  "<p>Tonight, the fight-fest formerly known as the sport blog gets a facelift, bringing it in line with the rest of the site. From the early hours of Wednesday morning, it will have a bright, clean design, a range of new editorial features to enjoy (not least a more user-friendly archive search) and functions that will take reader interaction to the highest levels.</p> <p>You can read more about what to expect <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/aug/19/blogsandcommenting\">from head of communities Meg Pickard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/aug/19/blogsrelaunch\">top tech-type Amber McNett</a>.</p> <p>We hope that glitches will be kept to a minimum - and please shout if you notice any. All your old comments on previous blogs will appear on the new site, so you'll be able to recall your greatest posts down the ages. The blog front will also have a stripped down retro - read basic - look for a few weeks, before it's revamped towards the end of the month.</p> <p>A few of you (OK, more than a few) have raised concerns about the blog. Here what Meg and Amber had to say:</p> <h2>Meg's response</h2> <p>Right then, let's try and address some of the specific issues you've raised.</p> <p>First up, speed. Yes. We know. We're working on it, and that's not just the sort of thing you say to get people to shut up - there really is a team of people focused on speeding up the load of the page as a whole, and the comments specifically. We hope we'll have something to share, soon.</p> <p>Secondly, the javascript thing. Ditto.</p> <p>Thirdly, we're implementing something within hours (hopefully) which will resolve a bunch of the complaints about the \"recent comments\" (they're going), and the post and comments appearing on the same page. Part of the reason that was done originally was because the javascript issue (above) would have meant that to put post &amp; all comments on one page would have taken even longer to load, so it made more sense to paginate. As I said, though, we're looking at the speed, javascript &amp; UX issues, and will make improvements as soon as we are able.</p> <p>Beyond that, the profile pages aren't the start of a \"Facebookification\" of the site - think of them as contributor pages for commenters, rather than social networking-type profiles.</p> <p>Lastly (for now), I've seen a lot of people saying \"if it ain't broke...\" or \"why not just leave it alone?\" The thing is, the old system we were using was good in a lot of ways, agreed, but was also held together with string and sellotape in places, so was actually far more broken than you might have realised. The fact you may not have noticed is testament to the hard work and diligence of our technology team over years, holding it together, preventing it from crashing and dealing with the frustration of editors who just wanted it to bloody well work.</p> <p>So the move to the new publishing platform and community tools does actually improve a lot of stuff, though I appreciate that change is always difficult and that the full benefits of the system haven't yet become apparent to everyone. But they will, we hope, as we tweak and improve and refine.</p> <p>In the meantime, thanks for the feedback.</p> <h2>Amber's response</h2> <p>Hi all - thanks for all of the feedback. We actually are listening! And I'm passing many of your thoughts on to our Technology team.</p> <p>Meg and I have posted responses to some of these questions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian/2008/aug/19/blogsrelaunch?commentpage=1\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/sep/09/andnextweregoingtobreakt?commentpage=1\">here</a>.</p> <p>There'll be a post on Inside Guardian soon about our use of javascript and our future plans.</p> <p>If you have a Java-enabled phone (most phones made after 2001, but you may need to double check!), we recommend the Opera Mini Browser. We tested it on a few phones here and it works fine. Let us know if it works?</p> <p>Here is a demo:<br><a href=\"http://www.operamini.com/demo/\"><br>http://www.operamini.com/demo/</a></p> <p>(it worked for AndyInBrum's Nokia N95!)</p>",
  "<p>The latest great orchestra to check in at the Albert Hall this year is the Chicago Symphony. It is a very different beast from the seductive Berlin Philharmonic; the Chicago sound is not beautiful in the way that the silken textures of the Berliners are, but it definitely commands respect.</p> <p>The first of two concerts under Bernard Haitink centred on Mahler's Sixth Symphony, a core work in the Dutchman's repertory, though his reading has mellowed with the years. There is less aggression in the opening movement now - \"fierce but pithy\" is Mahler's recommendation, and though Haitink didn't take the pith, he did blunt the edges of the martial rhythms, assuage the sting from some of its major/minor clashes, and made the alpine interlude with cowbells and celesta seem more of a welcoming refuge than ever.</p> <p>Sometimes the sheer assertiveness of the Chicago playing is distracting - there is a listen-to-me imperative in the brass, a brash, show-off quality to the woodwind solos. But the way in which Haitink shaped the gathering lines of the slow third movement was sublime, and he charted a wonderfully lucid course through the great teeming finale, using the vast orchestral muscle at his disposal with maximum restraint until the unmistakable catastrophe of the final bars.</p> <p>Before the Mahler, Haitink conducted the UK premiere of one of the products of Mark-Anthony Turnage's two-year residency with the orchestra. Framed by percussive, industrial sounds, Chicago Remains is a 15-minute tribute to the city itself, a steadily accelerating web of transforming themes with an inevitable jazzy edge, a taut, well-crafted journey through a musical landscape Turnage knows well.</p>",
  "<p>Even Brecht lovers, of whom I am one, may find their patience tested by this revival of his final play. For all the valiant efforts of Edward Kemp in revising the uncompleted text, it emerges as an Oriental political pantomime that starts as a self-hating satire on intellectuals and ends as a replay of Arturo Ui. The result owes more to confusion than Confucius.</p> <p>At least in the first half Brecht's intention is clear. When the emperor of China, who holds a monopoly on cotton, convenes a congress to excuse the commodity's apparent shortage, the intellectuals line up to whitewash the regime; there is even a prize for the best piece of official mendacity, in the shape of the emperor's daughter. But, while all this is obvious fun at the expense of toadying eggheads who will do anything to appease tyranny - and recalls Brecht's own subservience to the Ulbricht regime during the 1953 workers' uprising - the play splinters and fragments in the later stages. It switches its target to the brutal power-politics of a gun-toting gangster, finally superceded by a Maoist leader whose followers all brandish a little red book.</p> <p>At his best, Brecht was a master ironist adept at exploring the cost of survival in an unjust world. But here the satire is surprisingly coarse, as in Turandot's giggling arousal at the prospect of any unorthodox opinion. Even allowing for our own subsequent knowledge, it is also difficult to share Brecht's optimism about the workers' paradise supposedly ushered in by the Chinese revolution. I admire the wholehearted commitment of Anthony Clark's production and a hardworking cast, led by Gerard Murphy as a whimsically autocratic emperor. But the piece strikes me as a dated curio at a time when the real trahison des clercs is less subservience to tyranny than surrender to an increasingly threadbare popular culture.</p>",
  "<p>David Young, who has died aged 76, was Bishop of Ripon from 1977 until 1999. A fine man with a superb public presence, he brought to the bench of bishops in the House of Lords a quiet and humble authority combined with a sharp intelligence. Appointed at the age of 46, following the all-too-short episcopate of Stuart Hetley Price, Young showed a deep pastoral care for the clergy and their families and, over the next 22 years, won the respect of the people in this varied Yorkshire diocese.</p> <p>Knowing his own mind, he was a diligent, solid and faithful bishop. A gracious, open evangelical who also recognised the gifts of others, Young was able to gather a disparate team around him. Although committed to the ordination of women to the priesthood, he helped craft the 1992 Act of Synod to protect those opposed to this legislation.</p> <p>His passion was education; he believed that schools should be at the heart of the church's mission to the nation. Working closely with David Konstant, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, Young was chair of the ecumenical Churches Joint Education Policy Committee and, from 1994 to 1999, chairman of the general synod's board of ducation.</p> <p>In 2000 he was appointed CBE for services to the Church of England and to education. Committed to young people and the raising of standards, Young was delighted that the new city academy in Leeds was named after him. His interest in education was not limited to children and young people. He was a champion of in-service training for the clergy in the diocese and, for many years, was an ardent and loyal member of the society of ordained scientists. </p> <p>Although not a particular devotee of the general synod, Young loved the House of Lords. Beginning with his maiden speech in May 1985, he spoke on a wide variety of subjects and his interventions were always weighty, thoughtful, humorous and well-received. </p> <p>Born in Poona, India, where his father was a Brigadier in the Indian army, Young was educated at Wellington college, Berkshire, and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took a first in mathematics. Following a short time in industry, Young trained for the ministry at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, being ordained in 1956 to serve at Allerton in Liverpool, reputedly the best-organised parish in the Church of England, where his vicar was the redoubtable Robert Martineau, later Bishop of Blackburn.</p> <p>Before long, the call of the Indian sub-continent lured Young to Sri Lanka, where he taught at the Theological College of Lanka, near Kandy, and developed his interest in Buddhism. After only two years, because of the death of his first wife, Rachel, in 1966, Young returned to England with their two small children. After teaching Buddhist studies at Manchester University from 1967 until 1970, he became vicar of Burwell near Cambridge, combining this with some teaching in the divinity faculty, and then, in 1975, Archdeacon of Huntingdon.</p> <p>As Bishop of Ripon, Young was committed to inter-faith dialogue, putting this to good effect in Leeds. </p> <p>His experience in Sri Lanka enabled him to forge a thriving partnership between the diocese of Ripon and the Church of Ceylon, his gifts as a reconciler helping bring Tamil and Sinhalese together.</p> <p>Young is survived by his second wife, Jane, with whom he had three sons, and the son and daughter of his first marriage. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>David Nigel de Lorentz Young, priest, born September 2 1931; died August 10 2008</p>",
  "<h2>Thomas Cook's \u00a3518m court claim rejected</h2> <p>The EU's second-highest court struck down yesterday a claim for compensation of \u00a3518m by Thomas Cook against the European commission. In 1999 the EC barred a planned merger between Airtours, now part of Thomas Cook and renamed MyTravel, and First Choice Holidays. But that decision was overturned by the court of first instance three years later, prompting MyTravel to lodge a claim for damages for the losses it suffered because of the unlawful ban. The CFI ruled, however, that the EC did not \"manifestly and gravely\" infringe community law and dismissed MyTravel's action.<br><strong>David Gow in Brussels </strong></p> <h2>Ashley's Sports Direct attacked over pay plan</h2> <p>Newcastle United's owner Mike Ashley has come under pressure on a second front after a shareholder action group attacked pay proposals for executives at the billionaire's retail group, Sports Direct International. Investors are being urged to vote against the proposals at today's annual meeting. Ashley is already suffering a furious backlash from club fans after last week's departure of the manager, Kevin Keegan. Pirc, the investor advisory group, has attacked Sports Direct's bonus packages. It said the targets for the incentive pay scheme for top bosses were \"not sufficiently challenging\".<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>BG abandons \u00a36bn bid for Origin after Conoco deal</h2> <p>BG Group has pulled out of its \u00a36bn battle to take over Origin, 24 hours after its target tied up a deal with Conoco-Phillips to develop its coal-seam gas reserves. The Conoco deal pushed Origin's share price well beyond the A$15.50 offered by BG. Yesterday BG said it did not intend to increase its bid for the Australian group and expected to see its offer lapse. BG's chief executive, Frank Chapman, said his company could not justify the price implied by the Conoco/Origin joint venture. He added that BG remained committed to Australia and its liquefied natural gas joint venture with QGC.<br><strong>Mark Milner</strong></p> <h2>Brussels poised to take on Germany over 'VW law'</h2> <p>The European commission is poised to take on the German government in the EU's highest court over the state's holding in Volkswagen. Charlie McCreevy, internal market commissioner, wants the full EC to lodge a complaint at the European court of justice over the so-called Volkswagen Law. The ECJ banned the 1960 law last September but Berlin's proposed amendments reinstate a 20% blocking minority vote for VW's home state of Lower Saxony, which shields the carmaker from takeover. The EU move helps Porsche, VW's biggest shareholder, which plans a full take-over this year.<br><strong>David Gow in Brussels </strong></p> <h2>Move to unite savers with cash in dormant accounts</h2> <p>Two of the UK's biggest banks are launching campaigns to reunite consumers with money in unused accounts. Halifax is trying to hand back \u00a329.6m to people who have not touched their accounts for 15 years, while HSBC aims to help 17,000 customers reclaim \u00a324m. The measures come before the introduction of the unclaimed assets scheme, which is going through Parliament. Under the scheme, deposits left untouched for at least 15 years will be transferred to the central reclaim fund to be reinvested in community projects, although account holders will not lose the right to reclaim their cash.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>A critical report on the conduct of the police and MI5 in the run-up to the July 7 attacks on London has been shelved for legal reasons, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The intelligence and security committee, which consists of senior peers and MPs, was due to have published its report today. It is understood to relate to communications between MI5 in London and West Yorkshire police.</p> <p>The committee, known as the ISC, undertook to draw up a report last year after concluding that it was possible the chances of preventing the July 7 2005 attacks in London \"might have been greater had different investigative decisions been taken in 2003-05\". </p> <p>It emerged that MI5 and the police had many opportunities to identify Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer, two of the suicide bombers. </p> <p>The report is believed to criticise the exchanges of information between those leading the investigation into the plotters and West Yorkshire police, and how potentially crucial tip-offs were ignored or lost.</p> <p>Officials familiar with the issues say the ISC report, which has been seen by Gordon Brown, is now unlikely to be published until next year. </p> <p>The shelving of the report saves the police and counter-terrorism officials from fresh embarrassment as they consider whether to retry several men over the alleged plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic. </p> <p>Prosecutors and police will meet today to draw up a strategy after a jury at Woolwich crown court failed to reach verdicts after 56 hours of deliberations. </p> <p>On Monday three men were convicted of conspiracy to murder, one was wholly acquitted, and the jury reached no verdicts on four other men, despite them having recorded suicide videos. </p> <p>Scotland Yard believed the evidence they had collected amounted to a very strong case.</p> <p>The crown had claimed all eight men were involved in a plot to smuggle liquid bombs on to planes heading to North America, with the intention of exploding them on board with potentially catastrophic effect for the 1,500 passengers and crews. </p> <p>Those alleged to be involved in the plot were arrested on August 9 2006.</p> <p>The decision to act then was made for two reasons, the source said yesterday: on August 9 2006 covert devices in the cell's bomb factory in an east London flat picked up one man recording a suicide video; and in Pakistan Rashid Rauf, believed to be a key figure in the plot, was arrested at the request of the Americans, a move which it was feared could tip off the London-based cell that the authorities were on to them.</p> <p>The source said both events led to the decision to make the arrests, but the US action had not led to crucial evidence being lost. </p> <p>\"Even if [the surveillance operation] had gone on for a few more days we would not have found anything better as evidence than what was found in the first 24 hours,\" the source said.</p> <p>The two ringleaders were caught with a USB computer memory stick and diary outlining planning for the plot and for the liquid bombs and bypassing airport security. Also recovered within hours by police were the suicide videos recorded by six of those who went on trial. </p> <p>Whitehall officials were last night examining whether they could gain a control order against the only man who was wholly acquitted. </p> <p>Mohammed Gulzar had been alleged by the crown to have been a key figure in the plot, and flew in from South Africa on a false passport.</p>",
  "<p>More than 20 years ago, in 1987, a Cardiff newsagent called Philip Saunders was battered to death as he arrived home, after finishing his working day with a drink at his local pub. A police investigation was launched, and a total of 42 people arrested and questioned. One of those held was Michael O'Brien, 20, who was subsequently convicted of the murder and jailed for life. </p> <p>O'Brien always protested his innocence, but it took 11 years before his conviction, and those of his two co-defendants, was quashed. He was finally released in 1998, suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder. He has now written a book about his experiences, and campaigns for the rights of the wrongly convicted.</p> <p>At the time of his arrest, O'Brien was a painter and decorator with no previous convictions, although on the night of the murder, as he admitted, he had been out stealing a car for a joyride. Married with a young son and pregnant wife (his daughter died of cot death while he was in prison), he was stunned when the police hammered down the door and arrested him.</p> <p>At the heart of the case against O'Brien was the evidence of co-defendant Darren Hall, an erratic and suggestible 18-year-old. Hall gave the police many and wildly differing accounts of his movements on the night, implicating a variety of people. In his seventh police interview, he said that while he, Hall, had acted as lookout, O'Brien and another man, Ellis Sherwood, had carried out the attack on Saunders. </p> <p>Following the convictions, a \"Cardiff Newsagent Three\" campaign was launched, and the case was eventually taken up by solicitor Gareth Peirce. Over the years, Hall had changed his story on many more occasions before finally acknowledging that he had made it up. The case was finally re-examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which referred it back to the court of appeal, and the men were freed. </p> <p>\"I was very messed up when I came out,\" says O'Brien. \"I would put the three of us in the same category as [Beirut hostages] John McCarthy and Terry Waite coming home after being held hostage. I am on a lot of medication still and, if I don't have it, I can't get out of bed in the morning.\"</p> <p>Now involved with the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation, he is in support of victims having a sanctuary where they can be rehabilitated on release, with psychiatric help and the support of others who have been through the same ordeal.</p> <p>But he is anxious not to be for ever defined by what happened. \"I don't look on myself as a victim of a miscarriage of justice but as a survivor,\" says O'Brien, who now has a new partner, with three children of her own. \"Things are looking really good now. I feel that I'm on the mend and I want to make a success of my life and not always be known as one of the Cardiff Newsagent Three.\"</p> <p>O'Brien is grateful to the miscarriages of justice support service run by Citizens Advice and based at the royal courts of justice, which, he says, helped him with housing and benefits advice on his release. </p> <p>It took a more lengthy battle to win compensation. O'Brien received \u00a3300,000 from South Wales police and \u00a3692,000 from the Home Office, of which he has put up \u00a350,000 as reward money for information leading to the conviction of the real murderer. \"The relatives of Philip Saunders are the primary victims in this,\" he says. \"I'm just a secondary victim. We have a common aim, we both want the guy who did this.\"</p> <p>O'Brien, who studied law while he was in prison, and after release at the University of Glamorgan, writes in the book that the legacy of his conviction has been \"illness, paranoia, a series of difficult relationships, and the need to make up for a decade spent without being able to be with the ones I love. My whole character and personality have changed ... Before I went inside, I had no difficulties with showing affection ... I didn't know what a panic attack was. I was an even-tempered youngster who didn't have the anger which I sometimes cannot help from feeling now.\"</p> <p><strong>Paranoid and frightened</strong></p> <p>He describes after-effects including waking in the middle of the night expecting to see a prison officer, and sleeping with a knife under his pillow to protect him from intruders who would kill him. \"I was so jumpy and nervous that hearing a car horn would simply make me jump out of my skin. Large crowds around me made me paranoid, frightened, hemmed in.\" </p> <p>O'Brien's book comes at an important time. The CCRC is facing budget cuts, which its chair, Graham Zellick, has warned will lead to further delays in cases being investigated. </p> <p>One important lesson, says O'Brien, who is now writing a book about the prison service, is not to live in the past. His anger at Hall for giving the evidence that helped to jail him has passed. \"When I started studying law, I discovered that people making false confessions was quite common,\" he says. \"That helped me to understand how it could have happened. The resentment has gone.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Death of Justice by Michael O'Brien, with Greg Lewis, is published by Y Lolfa (\u00a39.95).</p>",
  "<h2>Life of your drive</h2> <p>Oxford Brookes University is setting up what it calls \"a sustainable vehicle centre\", which it says will deal with \"the current and future challenges facing the whole lifecycle of motor vehicles ... and its impact on the environment\". Hmm. Eco Soundings wonders whether it will be opened by Jeremy Clarkson, who was awarded an honorary degree by Oxford Brookes in 2005 for services rendered to the auto industry, and whose love of the environment is legendary. Clarkson's TV show, Top Gear, has just been rapped by the BBC standards committee for showing the great man drinking while driving at the wheel on the way to the magnetic North Pole. The show's producers defended the footage, saying: \"They weren't shown to be not in control of the car.\" </p> <h2>Panel beating</h2> <p>What exactly was the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) doing when it came out last week with a study alleging that \"payback\" periods for solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) could take 100 years or more. \"Misleading, inaccurate, and out of date,\" screamed PV company Solarcentury, which was backed by Sharp, the Japanese firm that has a large PV factory in Wrexham, north Wales, and is run off its feet making panels for the world. \"RICS' conclusions are a mixture of historic pricing information and the very crudest 'payback' calculations which bear no resemblance to reality,\" says Jeremy Leggett, executive chair of Solarcentury. Minimal research by Eco Soundings suggests that solar installers are offering retrofit PV systems with a \"payback\" of 13 years. </p> <h2>Hailing distance</h2> <p>An email comes from Kenya: \"For the first time in our history, a hailstorm hit an area around the Aberdare Range, near Nyahururu town, yesterday, leaving 10 inches thick of ice spread over an area of 200 hectares. The villagers were left in shock. We need to arm ourselves in advance. Send over winter clothes urgently. My heart got heavy to see a cow walking on snow with a lot of difficulties. This ogre we have labelled climate change is a real agony!!!\"</p> <h2>Making waives</h2> <p>National and international environment groups have sided with EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson and the UK government over the toxic French aircraft carrier Clemenceau, which is due to arrive on Teesside to be scrapped, with 700 tonnes of asbestos aboard. The people of Hartlepool say the town is in danger of becoming the toxic capital of Europe, with local company Able UK specialising in scrapping \"dirty\" ships. The feisty Friends of Hartlepool group has signed up environmental law firm Public Interest Lawyers to challenge the government's Health and Safety Executive for waiving the asbestos importing rules to allow the Clemenceau in. The case will hinge on how much the executive took into account French union protestations that there are firms in France eager and able to scrap the ship that India and other developing countries said was too toxic for them.</p>",
  "<p>Fred Sinowatz, who has died aged 79, had a turbulent time as Austria's chancellor, the head of its government. His tenure was cut short in 1986 when he failed to prevent the election of Kurt Waldheim, formerly an officer in Hitler's army, to the post of federal president. While the reputation of his nemesis never recovered from charges that he lied about his past, Sinowatz is remembered as the last of the folksy, honest and truly authentic politicians who shaped Austria's postwar era.</p> <p>Born in a working-class family in Neufeld an der Leitha, a small town near the Hungarian border, Sinowatz studied history at Vienna University and rose through the ranks of the socialist Social Democratic party. In 1971, the chancellor Bruno Kreisky appointed him minister for education and culture. He held the post for 12 years as Kreisky won an absolute majority in parliament in three consecutive elections.</p> <p>Sinowatz opened the school system for children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds by introducing free school books and free trips on public transport for students. He encouraged progressive artists to challenge Austria's conservative culture.</p> <p>Overweight and clumsy, Sinowatz was not the modern telegenic politician, but his popularity made him indispensable for Kreisky. As other rivals declined, Sinowatz was made vice-chancellor, deputy party leader and chancellor when Kreisky stepped down in 1983, on losing his absolute majority.</p> <p>Sinowatz had no hunger for power and took the top job more out of loyalty than ambition. His tenure was troubled from the start. Kreisky's shadow hung over him and made him appear weak in comparison. His junior coalition partner, the small Freedom party, was torn between its liberal and nationalist wings. The country was shaken by a growing financial crisis concerning the vast state shareholdings in industry, a dispute over a power plant and several scandals including arms sales to Iran and the revelation that Austrian wine was tainted with anti-freeze. He was widely ridiculed for admitting in a parliamentary speech that \"everything is very complicated\".</p> <p>Sinowatz's main political challenge was the 1986 presidential elections, for which the opposition People's party nominated Waldheim, a respected former foreign minister and UN secretary general. Though the presidency has little power, the Social Democrats felt determined to keep the position they had held for decades.</p> <p>During the campaign, press reports emerged tying Waldheim to the Nazis and war crimes in the Balkans, where he had served as a junior intelligence officer. Sinowatz, whose hand-picked candidate was lagging in the polls, piled on these revelations and attacked Waldheim as dishonest. Plenty of observers suspected that socialist party operators actually fed foreign media and Jewish organisations with damaging documents about Waldheim. For weeks, Waldheim and Austria as a whole were subject to an international storm of indignation.</p> <p>The effort backfired as voters rallied behind the candidate. A day after Waldheim won a landslide victory, Sinowatz resigned in favour of his smooth finance minister Franz Vranitzky, who soon thereafter ended the coalition when the rightwing maverick J\u00f6rg Haider took control of the Freedom party. Vranitzky governed the country for another 10 years in coalition with the People's party; he struggled to avoid international isolation in the wake of Waldheim's election victory and led the country into the EU.</p> <p>Sinowatz withdrew from politics, but had to face unresolved issues from his chancellorship in two trials. He was acquitted on charges of tolerating illegal weapon exports, but convicted of perjury in 1991 for denying in court that he had talked about \"Waldheim's brown past\" before the presidential campaign even started.</p> <p>Sinowatz hardly appeared in public in his last years. But his reputation improved. By the time he died, the battles of his tenure were forgotten and the country came together in mourning a humble, honest and wise man.</p> <p>His wife predeceased him in 1995. He is survived by a son and a daughter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fred Sinowatz, politician, born February 5 1929; died August 11 2008</p>",
  "<p>The universe is increasingly incomprehensible, don't you find? Consider that small part of it taken up by James Bond films. For decades they were satisfyingly stupid, making numbskulls such as me feel a glow of superiority. No one, with all due respect, has ever been intellectually challenged by Roger Moore. Not even me. Now, though, I can't even understand the title of the next 007 film. What does Quantum of Solace really mean? Is solace something that can be quantified? Or did Ian Fleming just throw words together, like an irresponsible God drunk with power on the eve of creation, hoping they would add up to something?</p> <p>And if I can't understand Bond film titles, then what chance have I got of understanding what is going to happen in a 27km (17-mile) circular tunnel beneath the Geneva countryside this morning at the start of an experiment that, it has been suggested, will unlock the secrets of the universe? Despite the obvious answer to this question (ie: \"None\"), I am going on a crash course to try to find out what it all means, armed only with a misplaced assurance that I am not the thickest thing in the universe.</p> <p>What, I want to know, do half the world's particle physicists hope to achieve by triggering a machine called a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to drive two beams of particles in opposite directions around this 27km ring at 99.9999991% of the speed of light, steering the beams at four points during their circuit into head-on collisions with enough energy to recreate in miniature the cosmic circumstances that existed one trillionth of a second after the big bang? </p> <p>Everything conspires against understanding. The European Organisation for Nuclear Research is confusingly known by its French acronym Cern, for instance. But that's nothing. Cern's scientists also hope to find extra dimensions, perhaps as many as 10, coiled up in microscopic loops. (I look back on that last sentence wondering what the hell it means.) They hope to create called a Higgs boson, which is a particle that hasn't existed since a split-second after the big bang and yet which, physicists hypothesise, was fundamental, billions of years ago, for the establishing the nature of reality. A Nobel prize-winner called the Higgs boson \"the God particle\", but every expert I speak to says that this term has no theological import, but is a silly, misleading piece of nomenclature. So thank you, Nobel laureate Leon M Lederman, for muddying further already murky waters. </p> <p>Discombobulatingly, I read that only 5% of the universe is made of matter that scientists understand. A further 25% is so-called \"dark matter\", which clusters around galaxies, and the remaining 70% is even more enigmatic \"dark energy\", which drives the expansion of the universe. Or so scientists claim. But hold on: if scientists only understand 5%, how can they posit anything about the remaining 95%? Aren't they, then, only slightly less ignorant than me? Won't you let me hold on to that dream? Please? </p> <p>Worse yet, the basic building blocks of the universe seemed to have been named by astrophysics postgrads on crack, or at least a dare. I'm familiar with quark, strangeness and charm, though only because this was the title of a Hawkwind album. I'd never come across a gluon before, though. Although it has an unwonted DIY vibe, like something you might use to hold your bookcase together if you'd lost the Allen key, a gluon turns out to be an elementary particle that causes quarks to interact, and is indirectly responsible for the binding of protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. What's more, your everyday gluon has something called negative intrinsic parity and zero isospin. It is, you will be astounded to learn, its own antiparticle. Again, I write these last three sentences and look back at them in bafflement. Oh God, this is hopeless! The only graspable part of particle physics for me is to be found in John Updike's poem Cosmic Gall: \"Neutrinos, they are very small/ And do not interact at all.\" I understand that bit. The poor little sweethearts!</p> <p>I ring the astronomer royal, Professor Martin Rees, for help. \"I believe that the key ideas can be explained by people who need to make a bit of effort to communicate at the right pitch and to people who, similarly, need to think harder than usual,\" he says. \" There is a special scientific vocabulary which is unfamiliar and the mathematics is very complicated, but learning about the experiment is like learning musical notation or like learning Spanish.\"</p> <p>Heartened by these words (even though I barely read music or speak Spanish), I settle down for a pub chat with people who have never aspired to unlock the mysteries of the universe. After exhaustively analysing today's other important global event (how will England avoid humiliation in Zagreb this evening?), we reflect on sub-atomic activity. At the Old Queen's Head on the Essex Road in Islington, north London, the conversation starts shallow before plunging deeper. Barry asks me the following: \"Did you see Frankie Boyle on Mock the Week?\" Perhaps I did. \"He said: 'I'm sure they're going to find out some interesting things about protons, but I would add: I don't give a fuck.' That's how I feel about it.\" Barry goes off to buy drinks.</p> <p>I turn from Barry, whose disregard for intellectual improvement and scientific knowledge is typical of modern Grazia-reading, X-Factor-venerating British society, to his friend Martin, who tries to explain what happened in that trillionth of a second after the big bang by using an empty beer glass - something I secretly hoped someone would do during my research for this article. \"Imagine,\" says Martin, who has an A-level in physics and claims to have read such books as Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat and the Fabric of the Cosmos and alleges that he's finished A Brief History of Time (as if), \"that this glass is a very hot bowl with a frog on its rim.\" Right. \"At the bottom of the glass are some worms that the frog wants to eat.\" Check. \"The frog can't keep still on the glass because it's so hot and so hops around. But as the glass cools, the frog slides down, just like matter did when the universe cooled in that first second.\" I see, I say (lying). \"But imagine if the bottom of the glass had a raised central podium on which the worms sat.\" Gotcha. \"Well, the difference in altitude between the frog at the bottom of the glass and the worms is parallel to the Higgs field of bosons that pertained in that first second and gave all mass-bearing matter its properties.\" Why does the frog slide down the glass? \"Because of time's arrow,\" says Martin, settling back in his seat proudly. Right. And what do the worms represent? \"That's not important.\" Frankly, I don't think Martin did read all those books. Or if he did, he didn't understand them.</p> <p>Barry, thankfully, comes back with his round. \"And the other thing is,\" Barry says, \"if we are going to get sucked through a black hole on Wednesday morning, I don't find it reassuring when scientists say these are going to be really small, miscroscopic black holes that they're going to be creating in Switzerland. That surely just means it's going to be more painful than if they were big holes, doesn't it?\" Marginally, perhaps, I concede. \"After all, it's more painful to get sucked through a hole smaller than the eye of a needle than one that's bigger, isn't it?\" </p> <p>I guess. At this point, I rise from the table and bid Barry and Martin, whom I would like to thank for their hospitality and for helping me not at all in increasing my knowledge of particle physics, a fond farewell.</p> <p>The following day I ring Edward Pattison, a physics teacher at Hayes School in Bromley, south-east London, for a Cern primer, ideally not featuring hot frogs in beer glasses. \"You're familiar, I hope with E=mc2,\" asks Pattison. Absolutely - and not just because it was a song by Big Audio Dynamite. \"Well, the more energy, the more mass you create and so you can make big particles - things that previously only existed in the big bang. Tomorrow is just the start, but as the Large Hadron Collider speeds up and up, it'll show what was there in the earliest seconds after the big bang, and then earlier in the big bang and earlier still as it speeds up. We should be able to see dark matter, which is what holds much of the galaxies together. You'll be showing what black holes are like, creating microscopic ones.\" </p> <p>Should I be worried that the creation of little black holes at Cern will mean I and my loved ones will be dragged towards Switzerland and thence to oblivion? \"No. The smaller they are - and the ones they may create will be tiny - the faster they disappear because they radiate very quickly and so, as it were, evaporate. And anyway, we already find them in space. We shouldn't worry about being gobbled up.\" Excellent.</p> <p>Next I ring Professor Jim al-Khalili, who is not only a theoretical nuclear physicist at the University of Surrey, but also has an OBE. Why is this experiment being undertaken now? \"We seem to have got to the point in describing the Standard Model where the theory has guesswork in it and it needs to be verified or falsified by experiment.\" The Standard Model, you'll be eager to learn, describes three of the four known fundamental interactions among the elementary particles that make up all matter. That theory, I learn, predicts the Higgs boson particle which has never been observed except, possibly, by God - and then only billions of years ago for a split second. He might have blinked and missed it. So he might like a mini-reprise. If he exists.</p> <p>\"You see, particle experimentalists have been almost twiddling their thumbs because, up until now, we haven't been able to create the energies necessary to create theses particles - if they indeed exist - while theorists have been theorising wildly,\" says al-Khalili. \"What we can do now is, for a fraction of a second, create the particles, the Higgs bosons, that theorists argue have not been around since the big bang.\" Why is that important? \"Because the Higgs boson, it is hypothesised, endows other particles with its properties. Mass for instance.\"</p> <p>Earlier, I had asked Rees to explain to me what a Higgs boson is. \"No,\" he replied firmly. Why not? \"It would take too long.\"</p> <p>Al-Khalili is more forthcoming. There is a story, he relates, that William Waldegrave, when science minister in Margaret Thatcher's government in the 1980s, launched a competition to explain what the hell this chuffing boson was (he didn't quite use those words). The winner compared the Higgs boson to treacle or molasses through which other particles passed shortly after the big bang. \"Another, better, story that appealed to Waldegrave was that of a cocktail party in a room into which a famous celebrity walks, Margaret Thatcher for instance. A huddle forms around her as she walks through the room and she finds it difficult to move. Then other non-celebrities come through the room and find it easy to move around - these are the particles that don't have much mass.\" Like neutrinos? \"That's right.\" The poor little sweethearts! Hold on, though; what do the guests at the party represent? \"The huddle of guests represents the Higgs bosons that form a field. It's, so far, a mathematical description, and the hope is that we will find, by means of the LHC, that it does exist by crashing these protons into each other.\" In the sub-atomic post-collision debris? \"That's it.\"</p> <p>What will happen if the experiment doesn't produce Higgs bosons? \"Well, the whole hypothesis might be wrong, and we will discover whether it's right or wrong in the next two years. For me, if it is proved wrong then it could be very exciting. All kinds of other possibilities could be discovered.\"</p> <p>Indeed, what al-Khalili calls one of the most powerful rival ideas is the so-called supersymmetric particles. What are they? \"They are the mystery, the dark matter that has been missing that we have never been able to see.\" Spooky. How do we know that they exist? \"We know dark matter is there because we know how it affects what we do see. It would be nice to see it, which is a possibility that the LHC holds out.\"</p> <p>Rees also hopes that the LHC will discover these hypothesised particles. \"Speaking as a cosmologist, I'm hopeful - indeed, I rather expect - that the LHC will reveal so-called supersymmetric particles,\" he says, \"because it is quite possible that they are 80% to 90% of what holds the galaxies together.\" That makes the research sound very important indeed. \"It is. It is absolutely the biggest science experiment ever conducted and so very exciting and important.\" Why? \"It may give us an answer to one of the key mysteries about the universe - the \"dark matter.\" Atoms make up only around 10% of the gravitating stuff that holds galaxies together. [I thought it was 5%, but let's not get sidetracked.] The rest probably consists of particles left over from the fiery beginning of the universe, but as yet we have only the haziest idea what they are.\" Again, I find it cosmically reassuring that even astronomers royal have only hazy ideas about such things.</p> <p>Is Cern's work worthwhile? After all, Sir David King, the government's former chief science adviser, recently argued that the \u00a3500m Britain has contributed to the LHC project diverts top scientists away from tackling the more pressing issues of the age, such as climate change and how to decarbonise the economy. \"I hear that kind of objection a lot,\" says al-Khalili. \"It's certainly not going to lead to a quality-of-life improvement, but even from just a cultural point of view it's important to know. There are certain things that a civilised, enlightened society should try to know. If it also captures the admiration and imagination of children who get into science as a result - which I think it will - then it is surely a good thing.\"</p> <p>Good point. If future generations are less ignorant than me about the nature of reality and what happened at the dawn of time, then that would be to the glory of humanity (among other things). \"It's a good moment to be a physics teacher,\" says Pattison. \"I keep getting stopped in the corridor by kids asking what it's about - the big bang, the LHC, all that. It's the most weird and wonderful things that interest them - stuff like this and quantum physics. </p> <p>\"There's a problem with the curriculum,\" he adds. \"What children study is supposed to be relevant to children's lives. As a result, we no longer teach relativity as part of an A-level course. But it is just this sort of thing that entrances children. If I had my way, I would teach 11-year-olds about space, quantum mechanics and relativity - obviously at a basic level. But to get children thrilled by physics at an early age seems to me to be important and Cern is helping with that.\"</p> <p>This resonates for me. I recall that my physics O-level course ended before we had even broached radioactivity. It ended without a big bang, but with something of a whimper. Perhaps that is why I stopped studying physics at 16 and now find myself struggling to understand the exciting things that physicists are doing. Many of the great heroes of physics - Faraday, Rutherford, Einstein, Dirac - never got namechecked in my class (I had to piece them together in remedial reading as an adult); still less were we as thrilled by the subject as the pupils Edward Pattison says have been bombarding him with questions, inspired by what will soon happen beneath some Swiss fields. It would be good if British children are less scientifically ignorant than I am. Perhaps, in my dotage, they could even explain to me what Quantum of Solace means. Or maybe that's too much to hope.</p>",
  "<p>Dramatic, sculptural and enormous, the brutalist buildings designed by Rodney Gordon, who has died aged 75, are among the most iconic of the second half of the 20th century. Despised by many as concrete monstrosities, with some now demolished, they sought to bring what he saw as the logic and reason of Modernist interwar architecture to an invigorated postwar world of expanded opportunities - \"the age of the people\", where, as he recalled, \"feelings of egalitarianism and concern for all was the norm\". </p> <p>However, while most of his successful contemporaries worked in the public sector, or for traditional prestige clients such as universities, Gordon was to build his reputation in a very different, new environment - that of commercial architecture and, especially, the developer-led shopping centre.</p> <p>As the leading designer at the Owen Luder Partnership, he was responsible for the Tricorn Centre, Portsmouth (1966) - which, in 2001, BBC Radio 4 listeners voted the most hated building in the UK. It was demolished three years later, despite a campaign to save it.</p> <p>He also designed the Trinity Centre, Gateshead, which became known to a wider audience as the carpark from whose roof mobster Jack Carter (Michael Caine) threw the corrupt councillor Cliff Brumby (Bryan Mosley) in the 1971 cult film Get Carter. Loved and loathed, but never unnoticed, Gordon's audacious designs marked him out as a seminal figure in English brutalist architecture.</p> <p>He was born in Wanstead, east London, to a Polish-Russian father and a Chilean mother. While Gordon was a boy, the family moved to High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and later to Chelsea. A gifted scholar, he went to University College hospital medical school, London, at 16. But, two years later, he moved to the Hammersmith School of Building and later studied at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, under the Bauhaus architect Arthur Korn.</p> <p>On qualifying in 1957, he got a job in the general division at the London county council (LCC) - \"the place to be for a young architect\". While there he was responsible for designing the Michael Faraday Memorial, the elegant stainless-steel box that sits in the middle of the Elephant and Castle roundabout, housing a transformer for London's tube system. This structure was listed in 1996 as \"a building of architectural quality and panache\", and a precursor to \"high-tech\" architecture of the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>In 1959, an LCC colleague, Dennis Drawbridge, introduced Gordon to Owen Luder. By the end of the year he had joined the Owen Luder Partnership and drawn up Eros House, in Catford, south-east London, while sitting in bed recovering from jaundice. Realising that the budget was insufficient for high-quality concrete, he deliberately detailed the exposed beams, columns and floor slabs to make what he described as \"a convoluted sculptural form\" which would dominate and distract from the poor surface finishes. The building won the Riba bronze medal for London in 1962.</p> <p>Although speed was as crucial as economy, Gordon felt in control of the end product. But this was not to last. Luder proved extraordinarily good as job-getter and business manager. Office blocks and shopping centres in Bromley, Hayes, Hounslow, Hammersmith, Coalville and Leicester, as well as the better-known examples in Portsmouth and Gateshead, followed and the office rapidly expanded. There was critical recognition and acclaim, with Ian Nairn, in an Observer article entitled Flamboyance in Concrete, describing the Tricorn as \"an animal, various and cranky, capable of inspiring recognition and affection ... the first no-holds barred explosion\" of a new architecture. It also won a Civic Trust award.</p> <p>Gordon was design director, with Drawbridge leading on working drawings and site works. Luder never interfered in the design process directly, and Gordon was never to object to his name being attached to the buildings. But Gordon was demoralised when Luder started to accept invitations to represent the firm giving talks to architectural students - a role for which Gordon felt he was much better qualified. Developing tensions were exacerbated when offices in Harrogate and Newcastle were set up to interpret Gordon's designs and, as he later recounted: \"Continuity of design was all but cut off, and I had begun to cringe ... at what was being built\". He refused to visit Gateshead, not wanting to see it close up. It all ended acrimoniously, with Gordon leaving the firm after only seven years - followed shortly afterwards by the rest of his design team.</p> <p>Gordon did not always design in concrete: as well as the Faraday Memorial, his 1961 house for his own family (in Burwood Park, Surrey) is a steel-framed structure, clad with diagonal timber boarding. It has triangular windows, and steel chains rather than down pipes to channel rainwater to the ground. He countered suggestions that it was unrelated to the famous projects by explaining that it shares an external expression of structure. This house survives, although the one built next door for a neighbour was recently replaced.</p> <p>On returning to London after only a few years, Gordon settled in Kensington. Behind a conventional mews facade he constructed a multi-level open-plan space, with exposed concrete finishes.</p> <p>In the 1970s he worked with Abbott Howard before founding Batir International Architects with Ray Baum and Larry Abbot - this became Tripos Architects in the early 1980s. In 1979, Batir designed one building with extraordinary panache, a bronze anodised aluminum-clad combination of shops, offices and flats on St James's Street, London. Its rocket-like corner turret is a nod towards the Edwardian listed building it replaced, and it was a controversial intervention in a highly sensitive area.</p> <p>Gordon knew how to enjoy life and had a reputation for fashionable partying and fast cars. He survived a heart attack at 42, and even when wheelchair bound towards the end of his life was irrepressibly entertaining. His early buildings began to attract new fans, lured by their sense of bold confidence, and Gordon clearly enjoyed being asked to talk about them.</p> <p>Sadly, this recent growing appreciation has had little effect on the owners of his work. Eros House has been altered out of recognition, Tricorn has gone, and Gateshead is set to follow. The Faraday Memorial stands in the way of the Elephant and Castle regeneration.</p> <p>With Gordon's encouragement, The Twentieth Century Society has put the St James's building forward for listing. He is survived by his partner, Sonia Power, his former wife, Janet, and his son, Hugo.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rodney Gordon, architect, born February 2 1933; died May 30 2008</p>",
  "<p>As the rising price of petrol starts to affect driving habits, it was perhaps only a question of time before the Driving Standards Agency, regulator of driving tests, got in on the act. Deploying an instinct which combines expediency with usefulness, the agency is today instituting eco-awareness for those undergoing the test.</p> <p>Would-be drivers can expect Britain's 2,000 examiners to comment not just on their proficiency in deciding whether it is safe to let them out on the roads alone, but also on their driving efficiency. </p> <p>Roaring through the gears and sudden braking - apart from the emergency stop routine - will not mean you fail the test, but may give rise to a word of advice about the advisability of smooth acceleration from the examiner at the end. You will get a nice leaflet too.</p> <p>To assess just what sort of a saving there is to be made, I was let loose on the roads of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, with one of the DSA's chief instructors to check my environmental awareness behind the wheel.</p> <p>I like to think of myself as a pretty careful driver - 30 years without an accident and only the odd penalty point or three - but it's fair to say that in 1977 when I passed my test the environmental impact did not play much noticeable part, not least because in those halcyon days petrol was still under a pound a gallon. </p> <p>Sitting with an instructor beside me for the first time since then - in his shiny Ford estate with all the gizmos rather than my battered 20-year-old Renault 5 which only starts, like its owner, with a wheeze these days - was also a daunting experience. </p> <p>Beside the satnav and the CD console - luxuries that I am also not used to - sat a small black handset like a mobile phone, ready to record every stutter and over-acceleration as we sped away on a nine-mile course through housing estates, up hills and down dales, past the estancias of suburban Hertfordshire and, briefly, down the London-bound A1. I thought I did pretty well, until we got out and Bob, the instructor, said: \"Hmmm, something to work on there.\"</p> <p>Back at the test centre, he pointed out my shortcomings, together with notes on smoother driving, gentler acceleration, keener anticipation of traffic movements, less sudden braking and, of course, the importance of keeping the car serviced and well-maintained, uncluttered with impedimenta or wind-dragging roof racks.</p> <p>\"It's a holistic view of environmentally-friendly driving,\" he said, proving his command of jargon skills as well as driving ones. </p> <p>\"Environmentally-safe driving doesn't mean going exceptionally slow or arriving later. Maybe you arrive in a better frame of mind, more safely - and having saved some money. These [petrol] price rises are a godsend for this scheme.\"</p> <p>With that, we returned to the car and proceeded along the same route again, though with rather more instruction this time, and the aggravating pointing out of my faults, including what I had fondly imagined was an energy-saving tendency to slow to a stop in neutral rather than by engaging progressively lower gears.</p> <p>Surveys have shown that drivers instructed in eco-driving methods achieve an average 8% saving in fuel over a year, with newly-qualified drivers managing even better at 15%.</p> <p>How did I do? A saving of 0.4 of a litre of fuel on the nine miles, equivalent in an hour's urban driving of using 1.8 litres instead of 2.2: roughly 50p for this trip but, multiplied by the 10,000 miles I might do in a year, \u00a3500.</p> <p>\"That's a reasonable amount of pocket money, isn't it?\" said Bob.</p>",
  "<p>When Frank rang a brothel in Enfield, he could hear a baby crying in the background. When Alan called one in Southwark, he could make out the sound of a child asking for his tea. And when Mick called another to inquire about their services, he was told that he could have a \"dirty Oriental bitch who will do stag nights, anal, and the rest.\"</p> <p>The men were undertaking research for Big Brothel: a Survey of the Off-Street Sex Industry in London, the most comprehensive study ever conducted into brothels in the UK. The project, which gathered information from 921 brothels in the capital, was commissioned by the Poppy Project, the only British organisation that offers support for women trafficked into prostitution.</p> <p>My co-author Helen Atkins and I recruited male friends and colleagues to help with the research, and warned them that the work might be upsetting. They were to telephone brothels, posing as potential punters, with a list of questions including \"What nationalities are on offer tonight?\", \"Do the girls do anal?\", \"How about oral without a condom?\", and \"What age are they?\" We wanted to look at what really goes on in brothels - how much control the women really have; whether there is evidence of trafficking; if local councils are giving licences for saunas and massage parlours when it is clear that they are brothels; and how the sex industry is growing and evolving. </p> <p>During 120 hours of telephone calls, we established the following: at least 1,933 women are currently at work in London's brothels; ages range from 18 to 55 (with a number of premises offering \"very, very young girls\"); prices for full sex start at \u00a315, and go up to \u00a3250; and more than a third of the brothels offer unprotected sex - including, in some cases, anal penetration. The lowest price quoted for anal sex was \u00a315. \"Come along and bring your mates,\" said one brothel owner. \"We have a Greek girl who is very, very young.\" While kissing used to be off-limits for women selling sex, it can now be bought for an extra tenner. </p> <p>Of the brothels researched, 85% operate in residential areas. Almost two-thirds are located in flats and more than one-fifth are in a house. Wherever you are in the city, the likelihood is that buying and selling women is going on under your nose.</p> <p>Our researchers contacted only brothels that advertised in local newspapers - not those that advertise on websites or on cards in telephone boxes. Because of this we only uncovered the tiniest corner of the trade. But we still encountered brothels in every London borough, with Enfield (a typical residential area of north London) having a minimum of 54, and Westminster at least 71. We estimated that the brothels we surveyed made anything from \u00a386m to \u00a3209.5m in total per year through newspaper advertisements alone. </p> <p>Although it is a criminal offence to advertise prostitution services, the law is not enforced, and this \"blind eye\" approach serves the pimps and punters well. </p> <p>Researchers also interviewed women who have worked in London brothels, and all reported having felt degraded and violated while selling sex. This tallies with previous research: one large US study on prostitution and violence found that 82% of women had been physically assaulted since entering the trade, with many having been raped. More than 80% were homeless, and a majority, on and off-street, were addicted to illegal drugs and/or alcohol. UK research published in 2000 found that prostitutes routinely face sexual and physical violence from pimps and punters, but have little or no \"workplace\" protection. </p> <p>One of the women we spoke to was Naomi, who, like many prostitutes, has a history of childhood sexual abuse. When she ran away from home, she met a man who pimped her - first into hostess clubs, then from a private flat. \"It's an unsettling, unhealthy experience seeing 20 guys a day,\" she says, \"and you don't know what the next person will be like\".</p> <p>A common assumption is that brothels are safer than the street, and while it seems that women are more likely to be murdered if they are working on the streets, the prevalence of rape and other attacks from pimps and punters is also high in brothels. \"The men have up to an hour to do what they like to you,\" says Janet, who was pimped into a Leeds brothel when she was 15, \"whereas at least on the street you can always try to run away.\"</p> <p>Rachel told us about the reality of how much money the women make, as well as the inherent danger in the off-street trade. \"Flats are set up to be a rip-off, to be truthful with you, because you're not going to make money for yourself.\" Rachel made about \u00a3200 a day, but after paying card boys, rent, the maid, and her \"protector\" (pimp), she came out with next to nothing. \"And you're not guaranteed security at the end of the day.\"</p> <p>Alice brought it home to us just how accepted and normalised prostitution has <br>become. \"You sit in a basque, in a window with your red light on. When you get a client you close your curtains and turn your red light off. That starts from eight in the morning.\"</p> <p>The minister for women, Harriet Harman, is determined to curb the massive trade in women's bodies. Last week she released findings from a Mori poll of more than 1,000 British adults on attitudes to paying for sex. It found that the vast majority of both men and women polled would think it \"unacceptable\" if a partner paid for sex; the majority would support a law that criminalised paying for sex; and around half would back a law that decreased the number of women being trafficked into the UK.</p> <p>As our researchers discovered, brothels market women merely as merchandise. Frank was offered \"two for the price of one\" if he visited during \"happy hour\" (any time before 5pm). One brothel owner offered to send two women to the punter's home for a \u00a350 delivery charge; another offered free oral sex without a condom if more than \u00a350 was spent; and at one suburban sauna, first-time buyers were offered a voucher which entitled them to 50% off the next visit.</p> <p>We primed the telephone researchers to look for evidence of trafficking. There was plenty. Brothels offered women of 77 different nationalities and ethnicities, including many from known-source countries for trafficking. One researcher was told by a brothel owner, \"For no condom and anal, call tomorrow. Eastern Europeans promised later in the week.\"</p> <p>One punter I interviewed for another research project told me that in choosing a woman, \"I made a list in my mind. I told myself that I'll be with different races eg Japanese, Indian, Chinese. Once I have been with them I tick them off the list.\"</p> <p>Many people are unhappy that this research has been done at all. The pro-legalisation lobby do not seem to want the horrors of what goes on in brothels exposed, preferring to present such places as being similar to an office environment; simple, clean, consensual workplaces. Punters are also unhappy about public exposure of brothels. One frequent customer at a Soho brothel told me, \"I don't know why people have to research prostitution - the army shoots innocent people, fast food poisons people; no one wants to research them. It's the only job that has no downside. It only brings pleasure to the customer.\"</p> <p>Some of the male researchers had previously been liberal about prostitution. Frank had thought that legalisation would be beneficial to the women, and Mick believed that some would be happy earning good money. By the end of the project, all the men considered prostitution to be a violent and abusive industry, and perceived the punters as harmful misogynists. Nigel said that after weeks of talking about sex to third parties in a cold, clinical way he realised that the women were being used as nothing more than a product. \"The idea of sex started to be devalued and demeaned, its sanctity lost,\" he says. Tony was shocked at the number of brothels. \"They're on high streets, down alleyways and in suburban two-up two-downs.\"</p> <p>Unless we think about sustainable and substantive solutions that will eventually eradicate prostitution, it will continue to grow at an alarming rate - research published last year found that in just 10 years, the number of men paying for sex in the UK almost doubled. </p> <p>What Big Brothel shows is that commercial sex is becoming as normalised as stopping off for a McDonald's. There are two key ways that the UK can respond. We can legalise the trade, make the women pay taxes, and declare the pimps to be legitimate businessmen. Where brothels have been legalised- in Amsterdam, for instance - the illegal sector continues to flourish. Since brothels were legalised in Melbourne, Australia, more than 20 years ago, the number of unlicensed brothels has trebled. Few prostitutes will pay tax, as the act of registering their trade is too stigmatised, and their lives are often too chaotic. There is no evidence that legalisation keeps women safe, but there is plenty that shows it results in an increase in demand for the sex trade. In Australia, $11.3bn was spent on prostitutes and strippers last year, and the trade is growing at approximately 8% a year. </p> <p>The other option is to bring in a law that makes paying for sex illegal, while helping to educate the public that prostitution is not a victimless crime. This has worked in Sweden, where such a law was introduced nine years ago, and 80% of Swedes now support it. Trafficking into the country is now lower than in any other EU nation. This is the approach that government ministers Harriet Harman and Vera Baird support.</p> <p>Most men do not pay for sex. Those who do need educating about the harm that prostitution causes to women and society in general. Some will only stop if they are frightened of the consequences, such as one charmer who told me, \"If she isn't crying but says no, I keep on. I only stop if she is really crying.\"</p> <p>Others are able to justify to themselves what they do, simply because it is not against the law.

  "<p>Shares in Lehman Brothers fell by 45% last night amid fears the investment bank would fail to raise much-needed capital to shore up its finances, plunging Wall Street back into a state of high anxiety.</p> <p>The Dow Jones index of leading shares closed more than 280 points lower, almost entirely erasing the gains made on Monday when the markets had reacted with enthusiasm to the bail-out of stricken mortgage finance firms Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.</p> <p>The oil price also fell sharply, with Brent crude back under $100 a barrel for the first time since April.</p> <p>Lehman's options for raising fresh financing appeared to be running out after talks to sell a stake in the bank to the South Korean government-owned Korea Development Bank were reported to have broken down.</p> <p>Lehman is facing billions of dollars in losses from ill-judged gambles on the mortgage market and the investment bank has become the latest victim of the credit crunch. The bank had hoped to secure an investor ahead of its third quarter results, due next week, but that is now looking increasingly unlikely.</p> <p>\"The market fears that no one will inject capital in the company,\" said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global Research in Chicago.</p> <p>Lehman is also said to be considering the sale of its asset management division, Neuberger Berman, or its commercial real estate portfolio to raise cash.</p> <p>Shares in the bank are at their lowest point in a decade and the decline accelerated toward the end of the trading session, closing $6.36 lower at $7.79.</p> <p>There had been rumours that Lehman would bring its figures forward yesterday in an attempt to calm the markets. The bank made no comment yesterday but senior managers worked late into the night and will be under pressure to make a statement before the market opens today.</p> <p>After the market closed, other banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, stressed that they were still trading with Lehman.</p> <p>Investors are on high alert after the near collapse of Bear Stearns in March. The credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's put Lehman on notice yesterday that it may lower its debt rating because of the \"heightened uncertainty\" about its ability to raise further capital.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, and the securities and exchange commission declined to comment.</p> <p>Lehman had been in discussions with KDB for the past two months but South Korean regulators told Dow Jones that the conversations had ended. The troubled US bank is understood to have held discussions with at least two other potential investors which have come to nothing.</p> <p>Lehman lost $2.8bn in the second quarter.</p> <p>The mood on Wall Street was further soured by fresh housing data, which showed home sales continuing to fall. The National Association of Realtors said pending home sales were down by 6.8% in July compared with the same month a year ago, a steeper decline than expected.</p> <p>Share price falls were reflected across the ranges of indices. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.4% and the Nasdaq composite was down 2.6%.</p> <p>The decision by the US government to seize control of the troubled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had given the markets a shot in the arm on Monday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 289 points.</p> <p>But the future of the government-sponsored enterprises was still far from clear yesterday. Politicians in Washington began squaring up for a fight over the future of Fannie and Freddie, which were effectively taken into public ownership in the largest bailout in American history</p> <p>The House financial services committee yesterday set a hearing date for September 24 and the Senate is expected to announce its own hearing in the coming days.</p> <p>An ideological battle appeared to be brewing over the future of the lenders with Democrats hoping to protect Fannie and Freddie's public policy role of helping low income families and widening home ownership, while Republicans mostly favoured their break-up and full privatisation.</p> <p>Treasury secretary Henry Paulson wants them to start reducing the size of their mortgage books in 2010, mirroring the situation that faced British lender Northern Rock after its nationalisation.</p>",
  "<p>If you were to choose a county to get caught trying to enter illegally, then I'd like to think you could do a lot worse than Britain. In Saudi Arabia, for example, you would be beheaded, immediately and publicly, right in the middle of the arrivals terminal. In China, it's a bullet to the back of the head. And if you try to get into the US overland, you're likely to be met not by the authorities but by a vigilante gun-toting redneck who will tie you by your ankles to the back of his pick-up truck and drag you back home again. To Canada. </p> <p>Here, though, I hope you would get treated with decency and courtesy. The people in<strong> UK Border Force</strong> (Sky1), which follows our UK Border Agency around at work, come out of it reasonably. I like the lady at Heathrow passport control, who politely asks a man to take his cap off so she can see if he's the person in his passport (he is, and he's also Michael Caine). And when an Indian man says he'll kill himself if they send him back to India, they take his threat seriously. The poor man - he says he's here for a five-day tour with his wife. So why have they got 18,000 cigarettes and 27 kilos of rolling tobacco in their luggage? I think maybe they're just heavy smokers, especially while on tour, but the customs people aren't buying 1,800 a day habits (plus a few thousand rollies), and they're sent - politely - back. </p> <p>They do know the cameras are on them, of course, so they're probably on best behaviour. And there's still room for improvement. \"You've got a lot of Afghans, Iranis, Iraqis ... \" says a British official at Calais, who's trying to stop \"clandestines\" crossing the channel. Iranis? Where are they from? Any Pakistanians? </p> <p>And a cheerful lady called Bridget, whose job it is to stick her CO2 probe into trucks to see if anyone's been breathing in them, says: \"We've got one here, guys,\" as if she'd caught a fish. And she goes on: \"We've got a young male Eritrean that's in here.\" Who's in here, or just \"in here\", would have been nicer, given that the young male Eritrean (Eritrani?) turns out to be a person. I know it's only language, but language does reflect attitude. Funny, really, that the British immigration people are let down by their poor command of English. </p> <p>\"He's fine,\" says Bridget, cheerfully, still sounding as if she's talking about an animal. \"He's distressed at the moment. He's only upset cos we've found him, that's all.\" Maybe Bridget's CO2 probe also has psychic powers, and tells her what her prisoners are thinking, and how they're feeling. </p> <p>Actually, I'd like to have known a bit about the young Eritrean - if not what he was thinking and feeling, then something of his story, maybe even his name. I know this wasn't the point of the film - which was celebrating Britain's Border and Immigration Agency, a human levee heroically holding back the flood waters of Hurricane Foreign Invasion. But I couldn't help thinking the people trying to get in might be more interesting than the people trying to keep them out. Typical bleedin'-heart bloody Guardian ...</p> <p><strong>Prison Break</strong> (Sky1), now in series four, has moved a long way from the original premise. It had to, I suppose - you can't go on breaking out of jail, or even breaking into jail - forever. So now Michael and Lincoln and the gang are breaking into lots of different places, in order to steal the data cards that will bring down The Company.</p> <p>I think. It's thoroughly confusing; what normally happens is that just when I've figured out who someone is, they get killed. I mean ghosted; it's important to use the right language when talking about Prison Break. My favourite line comes from Roland the hacker. \"Only if you don't got me, hombre,\" he says. Get that man a job at British Immigration. Lord knows what he's on about, or what any of it's about. But it's still ridiculously exciting - fabulous fun. </p> <p>I didn't see much of <strong>The Sex Education Show</strong> (Channel 4). Don't need it - I know it all, obviously. But I did like the girl who told us when she \"first lost my virginity\". Another candidate for Immigration, perhaps? </p> <p>I'm afraid I didn't see <strong>Who Really Killed Jesus? </strong>(Five). Was it Colonel Mustard, in the library, with the lead piping?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 13 2008.

  "<p>Joe Cole remembers seeing Slaven Bilic when he travelled to Liverpool with West Ham United's first team in the mid-90s. \"I was the mascot,\" Cole said this week. And did he have any particular memories of the tall Croatian defender? \"Yeah - 'avin' a fag on the coach after the game.\"</p> <p>If Bilic was just about the last of his kind as a player, he sometimes seems like the first of a new breed of manager. The man who wrecked Steve McClaren's England career, and who hopes to create similar trouble for Fabio Capello in Zagreb tonight, will be 40 next month, but you wouldn't know it. He has a degree in law, a good command of English, German and Italian, and an interest in the world around him. But the cigarettes, the tattoos, the twinkling ear stud and the sparkling sense of humour belong to a man who relaxes by playing guitar with his rock band. Their name - Rawbau - gives a pretty good indication of how they sound. </p> <p>Bilic and West Ham have been linked again in recent days, as part of the speculation over Alan Curbishley's successor. Top of the club's wanted list, he made it clear that he intends to see out the remainder of his two-year contract with his national team, even though, at a mere \u00a3150,000 a year, the salary is barely a tenth of the minimum he could expect to earn in the Premier League.</p> <p>At this juncture, however, the most important thing to know about Bilic is his record as an international manager. In two years and two months under his management Croatia have played 26 matches, won 19, drawn five and lost two. At the finals of Euro 2008, where they won all three of their group matches before going out to Turkey in a tumultuous quarter-final, he was the youngest of the 16 head coaches. </p> <p>That record lends weight to the words with which he entertains the media before and after international matches. \"Wake up,\" he instructed England after last year's victory at Wembley. \"You didn't lose the game tonight because of the tactics. You didn't lose because you played one man up front. We were simply a better team.\"</p> <p>He was at his best again yesterday in his hideaway across the border in Slovenia, where he takes the squad before matches in order to remove them from the temptations of Zagreb's fleshpots. How much, he was asked, has his team improved since they last entertained England almost two years ago?</p> <p>\"Much better, in every possible way,\" he said. \"We are simply better players, we are better as a team. We've had more training sessions. Before that game in Zagreb we'd maybe had 20 or 30 training sessions together. Now we've had 150. My players are now two years older. The only guy that doesn't help is [the 36-year-old] Niko Kovac, but only on paper as he's playing the best football of his life and will do for another couple of years. All the other guys are no longer 21 but 23, which is important, and we are a better team.\"</p> <p>The great striker Davor Suker, who played with Bilic in the Croatia team that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 96 and the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup, backed up his former colleague's assessment this week, drawing an interesting parallel with their shared achievements.</p> <p>\"Our Croatian team always played at 100%,\" Suker said. \"Even if we changed someone due to an injury, whoever came in would give everything he had for the side. Slaven Bilic has instilled the same attitude into this new younger generation of players. He has followed the principles that we stuck to. The spirit was never lacking, and we were always proud to play. It is the same with Bilic's team. He's a great coach who thinks about the game and understands what needs to be done. In two or three years, he will be a coach in the Premier League. But he will stay with us now because he recognises he is at the beginning of his career. He has time on his side.\"</p> <p>When Bilic accepted the Croatia job his only experience amounted to a few months as acting manager of Hajduk Split during the last season of his playing career, followed by two years in charge of the national Under-21 squad. On his promotion in 2006, his first selectorial act was to move Luka Modric, Vedran Corluka and the Brazilian-born Eduardo da Silva up from the Under-21 ranks to the senior squad, where his infectious enthusiasm, patriotic ambition and shrewd football brain created an instant bond.</p> <p>He seems to think of football as serious fun, which is surely how it should be. Whereas Capello was intimating yesterday that England now find it easier to play away from the \u00a3800m new Wembley, Bilic was able to make a joke out of his own team's remarkable record in the ramshackle, outdated, decidedly unpicturesque Maksimir Stadium, where Croatia have lost only once, a friendly against France in 2000. They have not lost a competitive game at home since their creation in 1990.</p> <p>\"It's easy to explain because the stadium is so nice. It's one of the prettiest in the world,\" he said, to the accompaniment of raucous laughter from his assistants. \"That's why we go there every week to train. If you don't go there a lot and then play there, you can be overwhelmed by the beauty of the place ...\"</p> <p>As England's players face tonight's task of getting to grips with the skill and inventiveness of the likes of Modric and Ivica Olic, a challenge that has twice proved beyond them in the last two years, they are unlikely to have time to notice the scenery.</p>",
  "<p>Weeks of protests by thousands who invaded his official compound could not bring him down. The declaration of emergency rule failed, too. But yesterday the Thai prime minister was thrown out of office - for hosting a TV cookery show.</p> <p>The country was cast from political turmoil to high farce after the constitutional court ruled that the embattled prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, and his entire cabinet must quit over the programme.</p> <p>The nine judges in one of Thailand's highest courts decided that Samak must go immediately for hosting four episodes after taking office, breaching rules that bar ministers having business links.</p> <p>Samak's ministers must also resign within 30 days once a caretaker administration is appointed to run the country, which has been beset by political crisis since demonstrators took to the streets demanding the prime minister step aside.</p> <p>But government opponents hoping the bizarre twist might resolve the deadlock appear set for disappointment after Samak's People Power party unanimously pledged to renominate him for prime minister, a role he took up just seven months ago.</p> <p>\"This is a complete farce,\" said Giles Ungpakorn, a political scientist. \"This law was drafted to reduce big business's influence in government. But here a cooking programme is being equated with big business and the minutiae of the law is being used to get the government out, and the judiciary's taking part in the farce. It should have been thrown out of court.\"</p> <p>Government opponents from the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which has occupied the grounds of Samak's offices for two weeks, failed to dislodge the PM, whom they accuse of corruption and being a puppet of his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra. </p> <p>Clashes between PAD protesters and government supporters left one dead and dozens injured, prompting Samak to declare emergency rule. </p> <p>But yesterday the court declared that Samak's \"position as prime minister has ended\" over his part in the long-running cookery show, Tasting, Grumbling.</p> <p>Samak, 73, had hosted the television programme for the past eight years while he was Bangkok's governor, but gave up in April two months after becoming prime minister.</p> <p>The popular show featured the passionate foodie wrapped in an apron whipping up traditional Thai recipes - pork leg in Coca-Cola is a favourite - before indulging in a ranting monologue on subjects of his choosing. </p> <p>The grumpy rightwinger would often visit restaurants or food stalls offering cooking tips. His other preferred haunts were Bangkok's \"wet\" food markets, where he would cast an expert eye over the produce.</p> <p>But the \u00a3270 he received for travelling expenses and buying the ingredients for each of the final shows after he assumed office was his undoing. He denied he had been moonlighting in the employment of the show's producers.</p> <p>The court disagreed, saying that Samak had \"fabricated his evidence\" and presented \"conflicting testimony\" to conceal the truth. </p> <p>\"His employment at the company can be considered employment,\" said Chat Chonlaworn, the chief judge.</p> <p>The judges ruled he had breached the clause in the constitution, which was rewritten after the 2006 military coup. It was designed to eliminate the conflicts of interest that bedevilled the rule of the telecoms tycoon Thaksin.</p> <p>However, the new constitution stipulates no further sanction for the prime minister, beyond being forced to stand down. It allows his party to choose him once again, as its leaders say they will when they meet on Friday .</p> <p>After initial jubilation the demonstrators occupying Samak's compound began to realise the ruling was unlikely to significantly alter the landscape or break the stalemate.</p> <p>\"Samak was ousted by the court,\" said a PAD spokesman, Suriyasai Katasila. \"But there is no guarantee he will not return in the next few days. So our protest will continue for the time being.\"</p>",

  "<p>The US justice department has hired a top Washington lawyer to lead a possible anti-cartel investigation into the activities of the internet firm Google.</p> <p>Sanford Litvack, the well-known litigator, will be advising the government as it prepares a case challenging a recent advertising deal between Google and its Silicon Valley rival Yahoo.</p> <p>The arrangement, which was made in June and lets Google sell advertising on Yahoo's site in return for a share of profits, has been widely criticised for handing even more power to the dominant force in internet advertising. One analysis suggests that it could result in Google having control of more than 80% of the American online advertising market.</p> <p>Google said that it believed the impact would be much less drastic than predicted and hoped government officials would not kill the deal. \"While there has been a lot of speculation about this agreement's potential impact on advertisers or ad prices, we think it would be premature for regulators to halt the agreement before we implement it and everyone can judge the actual impact,\" it added.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Yahoo responded by saying that it was monitoring the news but that \"we remain confident that the deal is lawful\".</p> <p>Litvack, 72, a former vice-chairman of Disney, has many connections inside the technology industry. He was previously a board member of the computer manufacturers Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, and was also an assistant attorney general in the justice department's antitrust division during the late 1970s.</p> <p>It remains unclear what the scope of any possible antitrust investigation will be, with speculation that the government could widen its remit to examine Google's increasingly powerful reach across the internet industry.</p> <p>The announcement of the advertising deal in June was primarily seen as an attempt to disrupt Microsoft's $44bn (\u00a325.2bn) attempt to buy Yahoo. That gambit proved ultimately successful, as the takeover was rejected soon afterwards. But the nature of the Google-Yahoo deal left a bitter taste in the mouths of many industry insiders. Complaints about the pact were widespread, including from the Association of National Advertisers, which represents more than 400 companies including Ford and Wal-Mart. </p> <p>Microsoft, too, protested strongly over the implications of the deal. \"Never before in the history of advertising has one company been in a position to control prices on up to 90% of advertising in a single medium,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's lawyer, told a US congressional committee in July. \"Not in television, not in radio, not in publishing. It should not happen on the internet.\"</p> <p>That brought echoes of Microsoft's notorious antitrust case of the 1990s, which saw government lawyers primarily focused on the anti-competitive practices involving the Seattle-based company's web browser, Internet Explorer. The Microsoft investigation almost led to the break-up of the company - until the arrival of George Bush in the White House in 2001, which saw the government backtrack and reach an alternative settlement.</p> <p>At the same time as news of Litvack's appointment was made public, Google also announced a series of initiatives it hoped would boost its public image as it hits its 10th anniversary. The Californian firm announced yesterday that it was joining forces with HSBC and John Malone, the communications expert and Liberty Media boss, to create a new company, O3b, which would focus on bringing internet access to the developing world.</p> <p>The new group plans to provide an extensive network of new satellites, dedicated to offering a web connection to the \"other 3 billion\" people who cannot access a traditional internet line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google also sought to allay fears over privacy by announcing that it would be cutting the length of time that it keeps identifiable information on users by half to nine months.</p>",

  "<p>David Cameron's popularity has boosted the Conservatives' presence in local government. Since he became leader in 2005 the party has gained 1,674 councillors and 60 councils and the Tories now control 215 councils across England and Wales. But he has not yet changed the Conservative party's character at local level.</p> <p>Tony Travers, local government expert at the London School of Economics, says Conservative authorities are as divided in their attitudes as they were during the 1980s: \"Cameron has not made a difference. There is still the same diversity between the Thatcherite authorities like the London borough of Wandsworth who want to cut council tax, and the old noblesse oblige shire counties who feel they have a duty to help the poor.\" He cites the contrast between the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and Essex county council, both flagship authorities in different ways. Hammersmith and Fulham is pledged to market-test all services and cut council tax year on year. Essex is planning to use its surplus to give targeted rebates to the poor.</p> <p>The Tories would like the public to focus on Hammersmith and Fulham. Cameron has visited it four times since he became party leader. Stephen Greenhalgh, the young leader of Hammersmith and Fulham, is in charge of the Tory local government innovation unit, which will provide a \"bible\" for Tory authorities. Greenhalgh believes in traditional Conservative values like lower taxes and the free market and opposes Labour's drive towards more equality and a minimum wage: \"I don't believe in the equality agenda and the market should set wages.\" Since the Tories have been in power in Hammersmith and Fulham they have cut council tax by 3% in two successive years, market-tested refuse collection and street cleaning, broken a manifesto pledge not to introduce home care charges, and axed a big social housing project. But they have also pioneered 24-hour community policing, promoted academy schools and plan one of the country's first bilingual primary schools in partnership with a French lyc\u00e9e. The council has a higher efficiency rating than under Labour.</p> <p>Greenhalgh said he wanted the poor to have a \"hand-up\" rather than a \"handout\" by encouraging home ownership and people to get jobs rather than stay on benefit. Officials have been instructed to reverse Labour's priority of helping the poor get the most out of the benefits system.</p> <p>In the north, Conservatives point to Trafford as a shining light. It still supports grammar schools, opposes Labour-controlled Manchester's plan for a congestion charge and takes tough action on crime, including introducing police powers to impose curfews on under-16s in troublespots. The authority recently agreed to keep weekly bin collections.</p> <p>But pragmatism still rules supreme. Boris Johnson, the new Tory mayor, has backed a London living wage of \u00a37.45 an hour and an amnesty for illegal immigrants, thought to number 500,000 in the capital. That policy is in opposition to Cameron, but regarded as a vote-winner in multi-ethnic London. </p> <p>Other Tories point to North Kesteven in Lincolnshire, pragmatic enough to keep its refuse collection in-house because it is cheaper. It boasts the highest recycling rate, 58% in England, and the second highest figure for collection of council tax. That authority, in common with other Tory councils, supports a \"respect\" agenda against discrimination which 25 years ago might have been regarded as loony left.</p>",

After my dad chucked me out when I was 16 I had nowhere to go. I started hanging around my local youth club and Michelle, one of the youth workers, started going on at me to become a volunteer. It was really informal at the beginning. I started helping out with things like breaking up fights and locking up at the end of the night, but I gradually got more and more involved. </p> <p>At that point volunteering was the only constant thing in my life. I was drinking two bottles of vodka a night when I wasn't volunteering but then I began to be given more responsibility and take it all more seriously. I began running things like healthy eating days and organising trips and, after I had proved myself, Michelle gave me a reference and now I've got a job as an administration assistant at a local youth training provider. I'm also doing my youth worker training.

I ended up sleeping on the streets for five or six months. I've sort of blocked this time of my life out of my head, but I was drinking and taking a lot of drugs. By the time I was 17 I was in court for attempted theft, possession of a weapon and ABH, but the judge said he would give me another chance. As part of my court order I had to go and do reparation hours at a youth centre in Westminster and came into contact with a project called Positive Futures. I started working as a volunteer sports coach for them, helping run a summer camp for youngsters and after that they enrolled me on a four-month sports coaching course. That month of volunteering made me realise that I could actually do something and stick at it. </p> <p>Now my life is totally different. I work part-time for Westminster council running coaching sessions and I've also started working at a consultancy firm in Holborn. I won a Crime Concern President's award for having changed my life through volunteering and I was also named runner-up Volunteer of the Year 2007.

I got very low and every day felt like a nightmare. Then I got in touch with a charity called Diversity Hub and they worked with me to set up an anti-bullying peer-mentoring scheme at school. At first I arranged meetings with other people who were also being bullied, but then we started doing other stuff like holding school assemblies and eventually we started talking directly to the bullies themselves and a lot of the problems stopped when people realised what we were going through. </p> <p>Volunteering as a peer mentor got me through a really difficult period and helped rebuild my self-esteem.

  "<p>McLaren have lodged a formal appeal against the penalty that dropped Lewis Hamilton from first place to third in last Sunday's Belgian grand prix. The decision to proceed with the appeal was backed by the fact that Charlie Whiting, the FIA's race director, apparently twice reassured McLaren that he was satisfied with the way in which Hamilton had allowed Kimi Raikkonen to overtake his McLaren after it had straight-lined the chicane immediately before the pits.</p> <p>\"From the pit wall, we then asked race control to confirm that they were comfortable that Lewis had allowed Kimi to repass,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, McLaren's chief operating officer, \"and they confirmed twice that they believed that the position had been given back in a manner that was OK. If race control had instead expressed any concern regarding Lewis's actions at that time, we would have instructed Lewis to allow Kimi to repass for a second time.\"</p> <p>There is not time for the FIA to convene its international court of appeal before Sunday's Italian grand prix at Monza. It is expected to adjudicate before the Singapore grand prix on September 28. The court has the power to restore the ninth grand prix win of Hamilton's career.</p> <p>Hamilton said yesterday: \"In the closing stages of the race I was catching Kimi consistently, lap by lap, and with three laps remaining I got close enough to attempt to overtake him on the entry to the last chicane. I managed to get slightly ahead of him in the braking area for the first apex of the chicane. He fought back approaching the second apex - but, in doing so, he left no room for me on the inside line. The only way for me to avoid a collision was therefore to cut inside the second apex.\"</p> <p>Hamilton goes to Italy leading his main championship rival, Ferrari's Felipe Massa, by two points rather than the eight he believed he had after Belgium. </p> <p>Surinder Thathi, one of the three stewards at the Belgian grand prix, said: \"There was no conspiracy against anybody, McLaren included. We acted professionally and within the FIA rules. Hamilton took a shortcut inside of the corner while off the track. We had a choice to mete out a time penalty or 10 grid places in the next race. We opted for the former and handed a time penalty of 25 seconds.\"</p>",
  "<p>An England shirt soaked in blood will forever symbolise Terry Butcher's commitment to the international cause. Yesterday, in his current role of Scotland assistant manager and arch-protector of a besieged George Burley, he wanted to spill some more. The blood on this occasion, however, would not have been his.</p> <p>Scotland's meeting with Iceland tonight has reasonably acquired must-win status since Saturday's miserable 1-0 defeat in Macedonia. Unreasonably, it has also been elevated in some quarters to do-or-die for Burley's troubled reign as manager; two competitive games into his task of leading Scotland to a first major tournament since 1998. Seated among those critics, it needed all of Butcher's limited supply of self-restraint not to leave them in the same crumpled heap as those strikers who lit his fuse as a player.</p> <p>\"I would have done things a lot differently to George in terms of reacting to the criticism,\" said Butcher, before the departure to Reykjavik. \"I'd have grabbed a few people by the throat and had a go back by now but, by law, I can't do that any more. Don't worry about my bad knees stopping me. I've got one good one now.\"</p> <p>Burley's tenure has attracted fierce criticism since Skopje, with Lee McCulloch's abrupt retirement for \"personal reasons\" adding grist to that victory-less mill. But it is the personal nature of certain attacks that has riled the Scotland camp, with the manager's courteous nature and inability to issue impassioned clarion calls through the media portrayed as evidence of weak leadership.</p> <p>Certainly it would be impossible to imagine Walter Smith or Alex McLeish, Burley's immediate predecessors in the post, handling the inquest into his credentials as calmly as the manager did on Monday. They would not have allowed the inquest to open at all. It needed the bad cop routine from Butcher, therefore, to give the good cop respite ahead of a critical World Cup qualifier, and to vehemently dispute the doubts about Burley as an international figurehead.</p> <p>\"George has had to calm me down,\" added Burley's former Ipswich Town team-mate. \"He is terrific and I am not just saying that because he is my gaffer. He is my pal as well, and I am godfather to his daughter. So we are quite close, but we are different characters.</p> <p>\"He has had 18 good years in management - and virtually every player who has played under him likes his style. The players are a bit bemused at the coverage. There has been a feeding frenzy. George deserves a lot of respect but he has probably not been shown that. He deserves that for what he has done as a manager and for the person he is. He is courteous but there is a lot of steel about him. Not many people have seen that so far but it will come through, believe me.\"</p> <p>Butcher produced a convincing counter-argument to suggestions that he and Burley should exchange dug-out duties because of the assistant's more forceful manner. \"Our styles are different,\" he said, \"but George has had more success as a manager than me so I have to admit his approach is better.\"</p> <p>It is out on the pitch of the Laugardalsvollur Stadium, however, where the defence of the manager will carry its greatest resonance. Scotland are four games without a win under Burley and their first-half performance against Macedonia warranted as much criticism as the result. Preparations for tonight have been disrupted by a hamstring strain to Kenny Miller, with the Rangers' forward a major doubt, although Graham Alexander has recovered from a thigh injury. James Morrison has returned to West Bromwich with a medial knee ligament problem.</p> <p>\"Kenny did three laps of the pitch yesterday and his hamstring felt a bit tight,\" said Burley, who has promoted the Hibernian striker Steven Fletcher from the Under-21s. \"If he's not 100% we won't take the risk.\"</p> <p>Despite the pressure and the need, most of all, to avoid defeat against an Iceland team ranked 107 in the world but buoyed by a draw in Norway, Burley remains intent on developing a more expansive style. Shaun Maloney and Kris Commons, impressive as substitutes on Saturday, are now in contention for a starting role.</p> <p>\"We've come here to win the game,\" said Butcher. \"We want to take the game to Iceland. Confidence has not suffered. There is some great talent in the Scotland squad. I know the players are hurting and that they are desperate to succeed.\"</p>",

  "<p>The sun never sets on the war on terror, even as it degenerates into blood and recrimination. The Woolwich trial of eight members of a supposed 13-member gang all but collapsed on Monday. Despite evidence of intent to blow up an airliner, the jury convicted three defendants of conspiracy to commit murder but failed to reach a verdict on the central allegation. </p> <p>It has been an open secret in police circles that Operation Overt, the most complex in counter-terror history, was sabotaged by the American vice president, Dick Cheney, desperate for a headline boost to the Republicans' 2006 mid-term elections. British intelligence was following trails and acquiring evidence against 20 suspects. They needed American surveillance help in Pakistan and shared their information, foolishly it now appears, with Washington.</p> <p>The backstory is told in Ron Suskind's new book, The Way of the World. Tony Blair, bursting with news of the operation, discussed it in July 2006 with George Bush, who was impatient for action. The argument, says Suskind, was a classic between American gung ho and British patience.</p> <p>Nobody was sure if the plot was more than half-baked game-playing and it would certainly need evidence to stand up in court. The British were \"treating it all as a criminal matter rather than a historic, and terrorist-glamorising, clash of power and ideology\", Suskind writes.</p> <p>Cheney then privately dispatched the CIA's operations director, Jose Rodriguez, to Islamabad to secure the arrest of one of the British suspects, Rashid Rauf, believed to be a possible link with al-Qaida. The British had been watching him and preparing his extradition. They did not want him rendered useless through CIA or Pakistani torture. Within days, news of Rauf's capture reached the British plotters. In a panic, the police had desperately to round up as many suspects as they could find overnight. According to Suskind, \"top officials in British intelligence cursed, threw ashtrays and screamed bloody murder\".</p> <p>Months of work, which might have unpicked an entire al-Qaida network back to the Pakistani training camps, was ruined by \"forced, foolish hastiness\" - and all for the mid-term elections. Bush was soon boasting of having \"foiled a plot to blow up passenger planes headed for the United States\".</p> <p>Two years later, a British jury, having to decide on the basis of evidence whether it faced another 9/11 or just a bunch of crazies, gave the benefit of the doubt to the latter. It was clearly fed up with scare stories and the politics of fear and felt the police had not made a case. Today, many of the plotters are at large, and Rauf himself has mysteriously escaped custody.</p> <p>This is what happens when criminal conspiracy is redefined as an act of war. It goes political. As a conspiracy to cause mayhem, the suspected airline plotters merited and were getting thorough detective work in what was clearly a superb operation. Because it was also a \"war\", the death-or-glory boys took over and wrecked it.</p> <p>Worse than wreck it, they rendered the operation counter-productive. A few sad, disaffected and clearly dangerous youths were captured, but in such a way as to induce many more to sympathise and imitate them. They will be fired by the same resentment at British foreign policy that has turned a crusade to bring democracy to the heathen into a bloody and drawn-out meddling in the affairs of foreign states. That meddling is now overwhelmingly counter-productive, fuelling anti-western insurgency across an arc from Syria through Iraq and Afghanistan to Pakistan. Characterised everywhere as a war on terror, it is further politicised and polarised.</p> <p>Last week's massive operation by Nato forces to move a dam turbine 100 miles across Helmand was reportedly brought forward at Washington's insistence to help John McCain's candidacy. It cost some 300 Afghan lives. Every one of those lives invites revenge against that dam. Meanwhile, Nato and the Americans are intensifying their bombing of Afghan and Waziri villages. Anyone who visits this theatre is briefed with the same mantra: We are going to stop killing civilians ... Every death is 10 recruits to the enemy ... We must win on the ground not from the air. Airforces claim they can kill with \"pinpoint accuracy\". They claim the new predator drones can murder a Taliban leader at a mile distant.</p> <p>They lie. To soldiers on the ground, calling in air power to clear a village is easier and safer than fighting by hand. As a result, and amid a storm of mendacious denials, wedding parties are blown to pieces, houses are crushed, women and children are massacred. To kill a Taliban it is considered worth wiping out a market. British and American generals in Kabul have slid into Vietnam mode, using the enemy kill rate as an indicator of victory. They do not care that one dead Taliban creates 10 live ones.</p> <p>An Afghan crusade that was possibly winnable in 2001 has been systematically subverted by those waging it. Attempts to destroy the nation's staple crop, opium, has alienated almost everyone and driven huge profits into the pockets of the enemy. It has been unbelievably stupid.</p> <p>The current use of drones to bomb Pakistani territory, usually on faulty or devious intelligence, is raising whole tribes to fury. It now risks driving an unstable Islamabad regime back into covert, if not overt, support for the Taliban, as in the 1990s. Is this really the intention of Washington and London?</p> <p>The war on terror has become an exercise in cynicism, a backdrop to domestic politics. Terrorists are a menace to certain western cities. A generation of young Muslims has emerged who see glory in killing civilians for nothing but publicity. They appear loosely aligned with insurgent forces in Pakistan and Afghanistan, much as terrorists in the 1970s and 80s allied themselves with Palestinians. But these terrorists do not constitute a threat to the security of any western state. Their plots and outrages are crimes and do not merit the status of war. They have become servants of political rhetoric. To be tough on terrorism is apparently akin to shooting a moose.</p> <p>That Nato soldiers can casually bomb civilians in these distant parts, knowing it to be counter-productive, shows the half-heartedness of this so-called war. So does the ease with which politicised intelligence can undermine a criminal investigation. Both make us less safe, not more.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>After years of inactivity, Steve Wonder suddenly has a lot on: an album in the making, a performance piece about his life as a blind man and, not least, his first European tour in a decade. Led on stage by his daughter, Ayesha Morris - who once gurgled in the bath as her father addressed her babydom in Isn't She Lovely - the 58-year-old arrives to the kind of reception afforded resurrected deities. Wonder's 1960s Motown singles and 1970s run of electronic-based, socially campaigning albums place him at soul's highest table. His back catalogue is so immense that even a supposedly \"lesser\" moment - the Bob Marley tribute Master Blaster - causes pandemonium in row 40.</p> <p>Moments later you can hear a pin drop as he explains why he is returning to the road - the death of his mother two years ago. \"I wanted to take all the pain that I was feeling and turn it into joy,\" he says. However, an introspective Visions suggests the anguish that inspired his finest work has not left him. A dedication to Louis Braille, another blind man who \"refused to give up\", is similarly touching, before the promised joy arrives with an upbeat Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing.</p> <p>The singer looked frail when he was led on but exploded into life once he had located his harmonica. Though he is playful (saying \"Hello Birmingham\" through a vocoder), there are uncomfortable reminders that this man hasn't produced a stone-cold classic since flares were fashionable. His golden voice occasionally falters and his quality control seems as random as pinning a tail on a donkey. There are interminable jazz-funk workouts and a baffling section where the footballer George Boateng arrives clutching a statue, which it turns out is honouring the world's first black pro footballer, from 1885, and not the ex-Villa midfielder.</p> <p>However, just as Wonder has always told us that if we keep on trying we will reach the Higher Ground, he delivers. A flawless run of classics stretches from 1960s stompers Uptight and Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours to sublime love songs My Cherie Amour and the funky I Was Made to Love Her, before a quadruple KO of Superstition, I Wish, Sir Duke and an extended Always. There's no Boogie On Reggae Woman, no Lately and no encore, but a simultaneously stellar and wobbly performance shows that soul's most gifted superstar is, more than ever, the most human.</p>",
  "<p>According to Tennessee Williams, depending on the kindness of strangers can have disastrous consequences. However Petra Barran's recent escapades suggest otherwise. In April of this year, she embarked on a nationwide tour in an ice cream van that she has converted into \"the country's first mobile chocolate bar\", offering homemade dessert in return for an evening meal and a night's board. Her journey has revealed a side of British hospitality far removed from the atomised existences that seem to dominate modern society.</p> <p>Having lived and travelled abroad for five years \"working on boats, looking after the super-rich\", Barran, now 32, returned home with no plans. \"I'd always been obsessed with baking cakes: producing something delicious, the result of my effort and love,\" she says. </p> <p>After visiting countries where chocolate was presented in interesting and avant-garde ways, Barran felt inspired to bring those ideas to the UK.</p> <p>From the cartoonish, bubbling fountains of the California Bay Area to the sophisticated edginess of Spanish producers, and the purity of the raw ingredient (cacao) in Mexico and Guatemala, overseas chocolate is awarded far greater culinary and cultural significance than in Britain. In fact Barran's assessment of the British relationship to chocolate sounds rather like the stereotype of our attitude to something else. \"It's a cheap thrill,\" she says. \"There's a naughty look, a glint in people's eyes, like they're buying drugs from you. Either that, or it's very formal and sniffy\".</p> <p>To learn the trade, Barran took a job at master chocolatier Pierre Marcolini's London store. Meanwhile, in her spare time, she refined her own recipes, such as hot chocolate rum souffle, white chocolate mousse, spiced chocolate fondant, Malteser muffins and chocolate Guinness cupcakes. Barran also set about creating the ultimate brownie. </p> <p>\"I can't walk past a brownie without trying it,\" she says. \"But it's almost impossible to get a decent one.\" Her criteria? \"A crispy, crunchy top layer almost like meringue, leading into cake and fudginess in the centre, with a sticky, dense texture and contrasting tastes.\"</p> <p>Once Barran's recipe repertoire was complete, a protracted search for a van began. Eventually she found one on Ebay that seemed suitable. The only sticking point was that it was located in Inverness, but after persuading a local acquaintance to take a look on her behalf, she bought it for \u00a33,200. Barran then travelled to Scotland to collect the van with a friend and the two of them spent a leisurely week driving back to London. A vague idea for an adventure around Britain started forming in her mind: \"A step away from the usual humdrum, to re-observe life through a chocolate-tinted prism.\"</p> <p>After a few false starts, Barran landed a pitch in east London's bustling Brick Lane and as soon as she had raised enough money, she hit the road. Selling her treats at festivals and outdoor events, Barran was always on the lookout for strangers to take her in for the night in return for one of her increasingly renowned desserts - chilled chocolate, amaretto, orange and almond terrine for example. \"I was combining two of our national loves: chocolate and pudding,\" she says. \"Pudding is what makes Brits tick. We're all so governed by it, whether we're overdoing it, trying to avoid it, or just pining for it.\"</p> <p>But the trip wasn't just about chocolate. \"It was about having a different conversation with different people every single night; entering someone's life from nowhere and then leaving again, back to nowhere\".</p> <p>Most people Barran approached were suspicious at first. But chocolate, she says, \"can melt the scowl off the most hardcore faces. It's funny - on the one hand, you might say it's only chocolate, on the other, would people have been so keen to let me into their houses without it? As soon as I offered to make them a chocolate pudding, they gave me instant access to their lives.\"</p> <p>Those who were receptive seemed taken by the notion of \"adventure for the sake of adventure\". \"Their enthusiasm was really touching,\" she says. Barran met her hosts via friends, her website and blog (which features pictures of the dinners and beds provided for her, and the puddings she made in return), as well as people she encountered randomly on her travels. \"At first it felt awkward, turning up never having met them before, but before long I loved it. And there was always a lot of booze flying around.\" </p> <p>Many of her encounters reflect a growing return to bygone goods-exchange systems. \"With all the crazy credit-crunch stuff going on, they're really attracted to the tangibility of bartering. You give somebody something real and they give you something real back.\"</p> <p>In Northumbria, \"James the forager\" took Barran into the woods by Hadrian's Wall to search for food, where they collected a supper of tiny daisy flowers, fat hen, red nettles and gorse. Like most people she met, he was extremely hospitable, even giving up his bedroom for her. A chef himself, James also insisted on making desert - \"the fluffiest, most perfect drop scones ever\", says Barran, who rustled up some Venezuelan Black chocolate sauce to go with them. </p> <p>In London, Barran was invited \"skip diving\" by her host, discovering a network of people sharing information about the whereabouts of \"hot\" skips. Her new friend, Rob, was \"an ex-public schoolboy trying to be free\". She joined him on his mission to escape bank accounts, Oyster cards, phone bills, jobs and rental agreements. \"We spent the whole day pulling cast-off food from manky old bins outside M&amp;S, Tesco, Costcutter and Somerfield. Back at the warehouse in which he lives, we eventually got around to eating dinner at 1am, sharing food with people who seemed like they hadn't had a decent meal in weeks,\" she recalls. Conversational topics included nomadism in Britain but thanks to the late hour, she had to write Rob an IOU for the pudding.</p> <p>The trip wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the van's original owners in Inverness. This time, their home was full of friends, with children \"in traditional Scottish outfits, performing dance routines and accordion recitals,\" she says. Barran made them a brownie fudge sundae for their trouble.</p> <p>If her experience is anything to go by, Britain is a far more benevolent place than we might generally believe: \"People were misty-eyed at the idea of me travelling around in a chocmobile, and were welcoming enough to provide me with keys to their homes, meals, laundry facilities, books, and more people to stay with. Perhaps I see the world through rose-tinted glasses, but I discovered a nation of smiling dreamers.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Check Petra Barran's whereabouts at <a href=\"http://www.chocstar.co.uk\">chocstar.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tell us how far your generosity would stretch for a chocolate pudding <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth\">theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth</a></p>",
  "<p>Even before we meet, I know what perfume experts and very funny writers Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez think of me: a woman with \"Lucite-heeled shoes and a ditzy high-pitched laugh that goes on so long it makes your companions gesture to the bartender to cut you off.\" Well, I've been called worse. </p> <p>Admittedly, this was their opinion of me as a 15-year-old and we all agree I've improved since then. Somewhat, anyway. I am now an \"ideally proportioned wonder\" (mais bien sur) and \"refined\" although I occasionally let my standards slip and am merely \"not bad\".</p> <p>\"Oh, I wouldn't worry,\" says Luca jovially in his American-accented English, despite his international upbringing. \"It wasn't meant personally.\" </p> <p>To be fair, it wasn't specifically me they were referring to, but the perfumes I have worn at various points in my life (respectively, Champs Elysee by Guerlain, Chanel No 5, Dior Homme and Marc Jacobs), which they describe and rate in their unexpectedly addictive guide to every perfume in the world, called, rather predictably, Perfumes: the Guide.</p> <p>But if the title lacks poetic fun, the book most certainly does not. Although the language occasionally dips into the kind of hyperbolic floweriness one perhaps must expect from enthusiastic connoisseurs, on the whole it is written with pleasing plainness and, most of all, a sense of humour. Guerlain's Mouchoir de Monsieur is lauded with an adulatory four-star review and readers are advised that \"if you can wear it without thinking of Rupert Everett playing Beau Brummell, do so by all means\", while something called Montana Mood Sexy is dismissed with one star and a curt \"not tonight\".</p> <p>Perhaps most impressively of all, the descriptions really do evoke the perfumes' scents, and smell must be the hardest of the five senses to communicate. Paris Hilton's eponymous fragrance, for example, is described simply as a \"competent but depressing woody-fruity-floral aimed at ditzes\", which is a fair enough description of both the perfume and its namesake.</p> <p>Luca and Tania, who recently married, meet me in the perfume department of Harvey Nichols in London. Despite the absence of author photos in their book, they look so much like how they write that they are easy to spot: he is a towering vision of irrepressible European poeticism, while she is a small bundle of American enthusiasm and no-nonsense. Neither can keep still when they stand next to a perfume counter; instead, their hands eagerly hunt around the bottles like woodland creatures hunting out truffles. \"You've got to try this,\" says Luca, brandishing a bottle of Chinatown by Bond No 9, while Tania stands behind him, sniffing the freshly spritzed air like an eager puppy. I obediently spray it all over my wrists and neck unfortunately just before hearing Luca's description: \"It's like Fracas, but sweet. It's trashy. Basically, it smells like a slut.\"</p> <p>Luca, 54, and Tania, 31 (although he aptly describes himself as, \"mentally nine, and Tania is a serious 17-year-old\"), have both always loved, in particular, talking about perfume. Like wine, perfume has its very own vocabulary: \"For example, oaky means vanilla ...\" Luca's voice trails off, silenced when he catches sight of a brand that apparently defies all of perfume's language: the label, to Tania's eye-rolling amusement, shows a drawing of a spurting phallus and the name, in the finest of perfume's overly sexualised tradition, is Secretions Magnifiques. It smells metallic with a tangy twist. Luca's knees buckle together in excitement: \"It's insane! No one can wear it - yet it's perfect!\" Tania looks a little less enthusiastic: \"It's J'Adore mixed with dirty knickers,\" she decrees. \"Exactly!\" cries Luca, still inhaling deeply. As we reluctantly walk away from the counter of sperm-based scents, Luca turns to me excitedly: \"They have a very good department here! I am very impressed!\"</p> <p>Personally, I'm still struggling with making the distinction between an unusual fragrance and a bad fragrance. Others would go even further. Perfume, while still being the cash cow that keeps many fashion companies afloat, often feels like an anachronism. I know many women who put on a slick of makeup every day, but none under the age of 65 who have a daily reliance on perfume. Tania and Luca agree that partly this comes from a fear of the stuff, thanks to the misguided over-enthusiasm of others: \"Women who flounce into the cinema wearing Poison have inspired generations of people to believe they hate perfume, \" Tania writes in the book. </p> <p>But if on the one hand perfume has accrued rather elderly associations, it has also simultaneously become seen as something for the star-obsessed pre-teen, thanks to the proliferation of cheap celebrity scents. Luca and Tania are sanguine about the dumbing down of their beloved speciality subject. \"Formulas are definitely getting cheaper but there have always been celebrity fragrances. Catherine Deneuve's was wonderful,\" cries Luca. At this point, I bring out of my handbag offerings from David Beckham and Kate Moss to see how they rate. Tania wrinkles her nose. Luca aptly describes them with a shrug as \"kinda not very much\".</p> <p>And then there are perfume adverts, with their weird over-sexualisation, which reached its nadir recently with the one for P Diddy's hilariously named perfume, Unforgivable, with him lying in an unmade bed with several young women from various ethnic groups, as though he was in a parody of a Benetton advert. Luca brushes such nonsense aside with the very wise advice \"just don't look at the adverts\".</p> <p>Another factor working against perfume is, perhaps, a fear of commitment: how to decide which one of the thousands of perfumes in a department's cosmetics hall best sums up you? Tania's answer is simple - don't. \"You don't only listen to one kind of music, so why would you wear only one perfume?\" The two of them have about 3,000 perfumes at home and Tania sluttishly moves between them. Luca is more faithful, surprisingly favours a lavender fragrance from a small brand called Caldey Island. </p> <p>The trick to choosing a perfume, they say, is to check you actually like all of the perfume, not just the top notes, which is what you initially smell. So spritz a little on, then go out for lunch and smell your wrist again in a few hours and again at the end of the day. Also don't feel that you should buy a perfume that suits your personality. \"It's great when a really feminine woman wears something more masculine, like a chypre [a family of perfumes with a top note of citrus and woody base notes]. It makes it more interesting,\" says Tania. </p> <p>Similarly, their counsel to men is to be more bold. Particular ire is reserved for anodyne sports fragrances, which Luca evocatively describes as \"apologetic, bloodless, grey, whippet-like shivering little things ... [whose] name involves the words 'energy', 'blue', 'turbo', 'fresh' or 'glacier' in any order.\" </p> <p>One of the most harped-upon themes in the book is that perfume is not there to attract potential partners - it is there for the wearer's own pleasure. \"The question that women casually shopping for perfume ask more than any other is this 'What scent drives men wild?' After years of intense research, we know the definitive answer. It is bacon,\" Sanchez writes breezily in the book's introduction. </p> <p>This seems an opportune moment to mention that it was perfume, of course, that brought them together - and not just perfume, but Perfumes: the Guide. They first came across each other in 2005 when Tania found Luca's blog on perfumes and the two began emailing and she eventually helped to edit his previous book, The Secret of Scent. After all of their email banter, the two met to write the new book together and \"headed off to city hall as soon as we handed in the manuscript,\" says Tania. They have lived in London for the past few months and are about to move to Boston so Luca can work at MIT for his \"day job\" as a biophysicist.</p> <p>Although part of what caught Luca's attention initially was that Tania's emails made him laugh, what really intrigued him was the way she wrote about perfumes. \"She writes in a way that I understand,\" he says. </p> <p>Writes and speaks. Hanging around with any couple can become cloying after a while - all those coochy-coo in-jokes and so on - but a morning with Luca and Tania is a delight. There is something rather lovely about seeing two people who are so clearly one another's other halves. \"When we're stuck in airports we always go round the duty-free together and have pop quizzes. Luca will suddenly spray something under my nose and say, 'What's this?' I'll go, 'It's Envy!' and he'll say, 'Damn!'\" smiles Tania. At another point, when discussing celebrity fragrances, Luca mentions one by Spanish actor Rossy de Palma, the mere reference to which makes Tania bounce with pleasure: \"It's got that plasticky quality, which occasionally I love,\" she chirps. Luca nods: \"Plasticky rose, with cat piss basil.\" He swiftly turns to me and adds, surely superfluously: \"Which is very good.\" </p> <p>Despite their unashamed obsession with perfume they wriggle when pressed to name the best one of all time. After much, much prodding, they finally concede that their favourite scent in the world is Mitsouko by Guerlain: \"It's like someone with fantastic bone structure married someone with fat in all the right places and they had a perfect child,\" sighs Tania, inhaling the fragrance. I give it a go. It is just too overpowering for my superficial nose, I fear, but they are ecstatic. \"Oh, isn't it just wonderful?\" cries Luca, and the two of them huddle excitedly over their perfect child.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Perfumes: the Guide by Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez is published by Profile Books.

  "<p>Kevin Boniface sees the same things as everyone else in Huddersfield, but more often and with a closer eye. For 10 years, he has heaved his daily sack of mail round the West Yorkshire town. And when he's finished, he writes books.</p> <p>They started as little more than leaflets, presents for friends that combined a striking photograph or painting with an observation from his postie's life. What do you do when you find in a mailbox a despairing letter addressed to God? How do you answer a regular customer who suddenly asks: \"Have you always had a beard, or is it me?\"</p> <p>Boniface, who is 38 and married, with two pre-teen daughters, did a short stint on the post before studying fine art at Liverpool University. He liked the life of what is officially called an operational grade delivery officer - busy mornings, and quiet afternoons to paint pictures, look after the family or write books.</p> <p>His leaflets grew into a beautiful \"art book\" with a limited print of 100, and that led to his current breakthrough, Lost in the Post: Dispatches from Inside Her Majesty's Postal Service. The book - illustrated by Shaw and Shaw, Kevin's sister-in-law Jo Shaw and her husband Christoph - is a shorter and much more cheerful companion to Post Office, the insider classic by American beat poet Charles Bukowski. Boniface was lent a copy of that by another Huddersfield postie in his first week at work.</p> <p>His own vignettes vary from a single line (on a man he saw cleaning his lawn with a dustpan and brush), to four or five paragraphs on the doings of Rod Singleton, a postman sage who's seen it all.</p> <p>The postie is also an important part of the book's revealing miniature glimpse of \"ordinary\" life in a modern English town. A man exclaims with delight when he happens to pass Boniface emptying a pillar box: \"Ooh, let's have a look, I've always wanted to see inside one of them.\" Two teenage girls ask him if they can touch his van for luck.</p> <p>\"I get asked where Jess my cat is,\" says Boniface, whose job remains connected to new generations by the children's TV series Postman Pat. He doesn't take his own cat with him, but remembers a colleague leaving his van doors open - and in jumped a dog. \"It was growling and he was that frightened, he slammed the doors and took it back to the sorting office.\"</p> <p>That's what happens to letters to God, too. Everything found inside a box has to go in a bag. In Boniface's time, that has included a lot of underwear, takeaway meals, and a flowering begonia.</p>",
  "<p>The London Underground network faces a new funding gap of up to \u00a31.4bn as the cost of repairing the system spirals out of control. The lack of funds for vital upgrade work has led to calls for further government cash for the tube amid warnings that the creaking network will not be able to cope with rising passenger numbers.</p> <p>An assessment of the tube's financial needs published yesterday outlined a shortfall on a third of the capital's underground lines: the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines. The latest figures create a severe headache for the government when they are added to the estimated \u00a32bn funding gap on the rest of the network. Transport for London, the London mayor's transport authority, blamed the government and said ministers would have to step in.</p> <p>London Underground's boss, Tim O'Toole, said the government must bridge the funding gap after it imposed the public-private partnership (PPP) programme that parcelled out the tube upgrade operation to private companies. The three lines facing the \u00a31.4bn shortfall are maintained by Tube Lines, a business whose investors include BAA's largest shareholder, Spain's Ferrovial. </p> <p><strong>Funding crisis</strong></p> <p>O'Toole has consistently warned that any attempt to cut back on the \u00a330bn upgrade programme would cause chaos because the network was struggling to cope with current levels of demand.</p> <p>\"Any funding required above TfL's budget should be met by continuing support by government, who imposed this PPP structure on the tube and Londoners,\" said O'Toole. He said the recent \u00a339bn TfL settlement, which covers 2010 to 2017, could be renegotiated if a funding crisis emerged.</p> <p>\"The funding agreement provided for the government to revisit the settlement if there are exceptional pressures. No one could have known what the result would be for Tube Lines. It was impossible to have provided for it.\" </p> <p>Under the PPP model, a franchise to upgrade and maintain the network is awarded to a contractor, which is paid monthly by TfL to carry out the work.</p> <p>Ruth Kelly, transport secretary, and Gordon Brown, who imposed the PPP when he was chancellor, must decide whether to bail out the Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The mayor's transport adviser, Kulveer Ranger, ruled out imposing big fare increases last week and said the mayor would go directly to the Department for Transport for the cash. </p> <p>O'Toole said scaling back vital work such as new signalling systems, track replacements and station refurbishments in order to conserve funds would create cost increases elsewhere, because maintenance work would have to be stepped up to deal with the ensuing delays and cancellations on an ageing network. \"It's like pushing on a balloon,\" he said. The Underground would ultimately carry fewer people than the 3 million a day it manages currently, added O'Toole, because the system would not be able to cope. \"The infrastructure is so old and unreliable that we are going to see a contraction in capacity,\" he said.</p> <p>The scale of the funding gap emerged yesterday in an initial report by the PPP contract referee, Chris Bolt. He said carrying out vital upgrade work on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines up to 2017 would cost between \u00a35.1bn and \u00a35.5bn. TfL projected it would cost \u00a34.1bn and therefore faces a deficit of up to \u00a31.4bn. Tube Lines said its cost estimate was \u00a37.2bn - implying a funding shortfall of \u00a32.1bn. </p> <p>Bolt said Tube Lines was running out of time to get debt-funding in place and start the next phase of upgrades. \"Unless we are broadly in the same place by the end of December, the chances of agreeing the numbers and getting all the financing in place are pretty small.\" </p> <p>Terry Morgan, chief executive of Tube Lines, said nothing in Bolt's report \"challenged or surprised\" the firm and that he expected the financial shortfall to narrow. However, Morgan indicated that further government funding was needed: \"It's not a debate about the PPP. It's a debate about continuing the investment in the Underground.\" </p> <p><strong>Signature policy</strong></p> <p>Metronet, the contractor charged with maintaining two-thirds of the tube, collapsed last year after building up a projected overspend of at least \u00a32bn. In an embarrassing reversal of one of Brown's signature policies as chancellor, Metronet is back in public ownership after it was taken over by TfL. TfL has yet to reveal the funding needs for Metronet up to 2017 amid speculation that it also faces a budget deficit on top of the existing \u00a32bn funding hole. </p> <p>O'Toole said TfL had made good progress in tackling the \u00a32bn funding gap, but did not deny that the deficit for the entire network could reach more than \u00a33bn. \"That figure embraces 10 years out,\" he said. </p> <p>One of the staunchest critics of PPP warned that cutting back investment in new trains, signalling systems and tracks would be disastrous for the network. Stephen Glaister, a former TfL board member and professor of transport at Imperial College, said: \"If the programme is not carried out, then we have got a serious problem with capacity on the tube in London.\"</p> <p>Sources close to the funding issue said they did not expect the DfT or Treasury to \"write a cheque for over \u00a31bn\". Instead, there is hope that the government will underwrite any related debt increase that is taken on by Tube Lines. However, Glaister warned that TfL would still need an injection of state cash because it would ultimately be responsible for paying back any extra Tube Lines debt. \"It would essentially be rubber money,\" he said.</p> <h2>Fares are not enough</h2> <p>Tim O'Toole, the head of London Underground, ruled out hiking fares to cover a potential \u00a31.4bn funding gap. \"There is no way you can raise fares to cover this. It is impossible,\" said LU's managing director. The tube takes about \u00a31.5bn a year in fares. Plugging a \u00a31.4bn hole would therefore require a near doubling of prices. Last week the London mayor, Boris Johnson, imposed above-inflation fare increases, blaming the move on an \u00a384m shortfall left by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone. Total fare revenues on Transport for London services, including buses and the DLR, were just under \u00a33bn last year.</p>",
  "<p>The growth of global media channels and 24/7 news networks means the work of charity media and communications departments has never been more important in getting vital messages out across the planet. While once consigned to a peripheral role within many voluntary organisations, press offices are now some of the busiest and most creative places to work in the charity sector. Media and communications departments are staffed by a huge variety of people with specialist skills, from press officers to film-makers, copywriters, designers and celebrity bookers. </p> <p>John McKie, ex-editor of the now-defunct pop magazine Smash Hits, works at development agency Christian Aid as an artist liaison, which means he manages relationships with celebrities to help raise the charity's profile.</p> <p>\"We reach millions of people through our media coverage, but sometimes it helps if you can add a celebrity in the mix,\" he explains. \"They might go and visit a project, and might be able to speak knowledgably about the issues. That can be a massive benefit to an organisation like us, and most charities have someone doing this kind of work.\"</p> <p><strong>Star attraction</strong><br>McKie's past jobs in music journalism mean he is accustomed to working with celebrities, and is not easily star-struck. But there are big differences between his past career and his current work. </p> <p>\"I didn't have to be an expert on the Mozambiquan civil war at Smash Hits, and I don't need to know much about Steps in this job,\" he points out. \"The main skills you need for this are perseverance, patience, a certain strategic brain, and it helps if you have people skills.\"</p> <p>Beth Jepson, multimedia officer at WaterAid, has made similar cross-over career moves. A degree in media professional studies - in conjunction with Mersey Television - led her to gain experience as a runner on the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. From there, she got a job in admin at Save the Children and worked up to be the media unit co-ordinator before moving to WaterAid. \"My job at WaterAid is to make short films to highlight our work,\" she says. \"I sit in the press office, but my work spans the whole organisation. We use films to gain media coverage, or if we have an event or issue to push.\"</p> <p>This year is the International Year of Sanitation, so Jepson has made short viral films published on YouTube, called Pooing in Public, to shock viewers into understanding how vital sanitation is for public health. </p> <p>\"My job is an emerging one,\" she says. \"You can talk to supporters and journalists, but it's hard to capture what it means to live without access to a toilet. Putting these videos online is quite new and has been hugely successful. Charities are also starting to see the importance of giving a voice to the people they work with, which we can do more of through film.\"</p> <p><strong>Small charities, big ideas</strong><br>WaterAid and Christian Aid are high-profile organisations, with room for specialised jobs like film-making. But there are thousands of smaller, more obscure charities that also need to sell their cause.</p> <p>Jaime Eastham is the communications and membership manager of the Bat Conservation Trust - one of only two in her department. \"With a lot of charity PR, the cause is already sold and it's a matter of getting a bigger piece of the pie,\" she says. \"I like it that this is a more unusual area. Bats are a misunderstood animal and you have to really change people's minds.\"</p> <p>Eastham worked as a journalist in her native Australia and, after moving to the UK, worked in the press office at Action for Prisoners' Families - another difficult sell. The challenge is to find creative ways of getting your charity into the public consciousness, she says, and to think on your feet when stories break that are relevant to your organisation.</p> <p>\"Last year we partnered with the New Covent Garden food company during Halloween,\" she says. \"I also try and turn around negative stories. If a building development is held up by a roost of bats, I try to explain why. Then there was the story recently where a woman found a bat in her bra, after wearing it to work. I had dozens of calls that day, and in the end it wasn't such a negative story at all.\"</p> <p>The real difference for people working in charity media and communications is that they are promoting something they feel is important, often more satisfying than just pushing product at a public relations agency.</p> <p>\"I just find it more motivating to sell a cause rather than a product or service,\" says Eastham. \"Bats have recently been accepted as an 'indicator species', which the government uses to assess the health of wildlife as a whole. That was after lots of lobbying by us. I like knowing that what I do has made a difference.\"</p> <p><a href=\"www.christianaid.org.uk\">christianaid.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.bats.org.uk\">bats.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"www.wateraid.org/uk\">wateraid.org/uk</a></p>",

  "<p>Artists have found a new way to tackle terrorism: with tapestries. Grayson Perry has put aside his pottery and taken up the ancient art form once used in days of old to depict brutal battles. The 2003 Turner prize winner's latest work shows a figure brandishing a gun, wearing a vest of bombs. \"Vote Alan Measles for God,\" it says. \"He will save us.\"</p> <p>Perry is one of a raft of contemporary artists - including Gavin Turk, Gary Hume, Peter Blake, Paul Noble and Kara Walker - who have designed tapestries for an exhibition called Demons, Yarns and Tales, which opens at the Dairy gallery, London, this November. Commissioned by Banners of Persuasion, a company set up by designer rug-makers Christopher and Suzanne Sharp , the show's 14 tapestries were three years in the making. Following the medieval tradition of commissioning artists to depict a scene, then getting craftsmen to make the tapestry, each contributor designed an artwork that was then hand-woven in silk, wool, metallic and gold thread.</p> <p>Their themes vary from landscape to fashion, from race to international conflict. Kara Walker's A Warm Summer Evening in 1863 shows a black silhouette of a lynched female figure in front of a scene of racial mob violence. Gary Hume's Georgie and Orchids is a tribute to his wife, featuring a triple portrait of her among flowers. </p> <p>\"A huge amount of work has gone into each tapestry,\" says Christopher Sharp. \"Each single thread has to be hand-dyed and tied. It's exciting to find a medium in which these artists' work can take on a whole new way of life.\"</p>",
  "<p>Remember 1994? Blur's Girls &amp; Boys was at the top of the charts, a new sitcom called Friends started to air and I spent a lot of time in the college computer room emailing my then boyfriend, and getting wildly excited when we found we were emailing <em>at the same time</em>. We'd exchange emails, rapidly click \"check for mail\" and, with only five minutes to wait between messages it was almost like we were having a real conversation!<br> Times have changed, and now instant-messaging software is everywhere. Skype, Windows Live messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and Jabber have a combined total of almost 1 billion users. And that doesn't include the 783 million registered users of Tencent QQ, a messaging service most popular in China. </p> <p>Multiprotocol instant message programs like <a href=\"http://www.adiumx.com\">Adium</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ceruleanstudios.com\">Trillian</a> have been created, to allow people with multiple accounts on different messaging systems to read their messages without keeping half a dozen separate programs running. Online games like World of Warcraft have their own instant chat systems, no internet dating site would be complete without one, and even Facebook's recently jumped on the bandwagon.<br> With all these opportunities for real-time chat, it's easier than ever to make friends online with people in different cities, different countries, and different timezones. But are instant messenger friendships \"real\" friendships? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/sep/11/facebook.myspace\">A study last year suggested not </a>, saying that \"90% of contacts who the subjects regarded as close friends were people they had met face to face\". That's not very surprising. What interests me is that 10%: people who had not met face-to-face but nonetheless considered each other close friends. <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15114\">Another study</a> found that 75% of online role-playing gamers \u2013 a technophile group, admittedly \u2013 had made good friendships online. </p> <p>This raises the question of what a \"real\" friendship is. My college boyfriend and I might have communicated by email, but we did spend plenty of time together IRL \u2013 \"in real life\". But among my geek friends \u2013 mostly younger than me \u2013 I'm practically unique in never having made friends with someone I met purely online.<br> My instinct remains that real-life friendships must surely be more solid, more authentic, than purely online encounters. But my experience of instant messenger communication is slowly making me change my mind. My dear friend Andrea \u2013 who lives in New York \u2013 and I have probably spent a total of 24 hours in one another's physical company. But, after \"meeting\" online while working on a project together several years ago, we talk almost every day. In a way, this friendship seems purer than a real-life one: Andrea doesn't have to come over to my place to chat, and deal with my washing-up aversion, my bad-hair days, or the mess that accumulates when I'm working. We can share ideas, insights, complaints and triumphs throughout the day, becoming <a href=\"http://rooreynolds.com/2008/03/12/ambient-skype/\">quasi-ambient communicators</a> in a way that would probably drive me crazy if we were in the same room all the time.<br> This form of communication does change friendship, of course. In a way, it makes us more likely to take one another's side. If we were living closer together we'd probably by now have spent a lot of time not just with each other but also with each other's friends, partners and families. And, when we reported an argument or a falling-out, that more rounded view might make us less sympathetic. As it is, we are each other's only windows on our worlds; this doesn't make the friendship less \"real\", but it does make it different. </p> <p>I can't, of course, go round to Andrea's place to babysit her children. She can't bring me chicken soup when I'm ill. But the affectionate cheerleading of an online friendship are, nonetheless, pretty comforting.</p>",
  "<p>The first thing you notice about Kirk Dawes is his physical presence. He's powerfully built, 6ft 2ins tall and weighing over 16 stone, with a 52-inch chest and a handshake that leaves an impression. Nobody would choose to call Dawes, the managing director of West Midlands Mediation and Transformation Services (WMMTS), a \"pussy\" - the street term for gang members who back down from conflict. \"Words are far more powerful than violence,\" the former police officer growls. \"Getting that message across is our aim.\"</p> <p>Dawes is 50, a former regional chair of the Black and Asian Police Association, who had to give up his career in the police force four years ago because of a lung condition that also curtailed his work as a basketball coach. He arrives half-an-hour late for our interview, lugging a workbag the size of a suitcase. But it would be churlish to complain. After all, he has been detained by a conversation with a \"player\", as he calls gang members. And it is not too dramatic to suggest that conversations aimed at reducing conflict can make the difference between life and death in the delicate web of mediation.</p> <p>The past month has seen a flare-up in the simmering, long-term conflict between the Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew in the north-west section of inner-city Birmingham. There were three alleged gang-related murders in August. That is one more than in the whole of 2007. On a whiteboard in the corner of the WMMTS office are various felt-tip squiggles where Dawes has been \"conflict mapping\" - outlining who did what to whom, and why. </p> <p>\"Few shootings are directly to do with drugs,\" Dawes explains. \"Yes, the players are involved in the trade, but the conflict usually comes over issues of respect. Somebody's strayed into another gang's territory or slept with someone else's sister or cousin. At times, it's a bit like Romeo and Juliet,\" he adds, reflecting on one of his favourite ballets. Indeed, this former drug squad undercover worker is now on the board of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. </p> <p>Right now, however, he has little spare time to indulge his love of dance. There is work to be done to prevent a re-escalation of serious violence in a city that had seemed to be doing better than other major centres - notably London and Manchester - in suppressing the problem. </p> <p>There were 27 gang-related murders in Birmingham in the 12 months that preceded the deaths of Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare, innocent victims of a drive-by shooting in the early hours of January 2 2003. Last year, there were two gang murders, the same number as in 2006. So has WMMTS, a not-for-profit company, made a difference, or is it just that some of the gang leaders were locked away at a time when Dawes was still a serving officer?</p> <p><strong>Robust policing</strong></p> <p>\"I know we've made a difference,\" he says. \"Robust policing is important, and we work closely with the police under the umbrella of the Reducing Gang Violence Group in Birmingham. But when a player is sent down for a lengthy sentence, there's always someone ready to step into his shoes. Many of them are brighter than you'd imagine. What they can't see, though, is any future. So you have to get them out of that mindset and into their imaginations.</p> <p>\"We've trained 31 mediators, and we use 15 regularly. They could be firemen, recruitment consultants, mothers, or former players themselves. One is a bloke I sent down for 14 years when I was with the drug squad. The next time I met him was at a do at the Home Office.\" Dawes has been a member of the gun crime round table group, under various home secretaries, since 2001. </p> <p>What concerns him now is a threat to the government funding that his company depends upon. Neighbourhood Renewal money ceased in April. \"Since then, they've brought in local area agreements,\" Dawes says. \"But local authorities are still trying to work out what it means. Birmingham city council has provided us with shortfall funding, which may run out in November.\" And after that? Dawes shrugs. \"It costs around of a third of a million a year to run this place, yet the average murder takes around \u00a31.4m from the public purse,\" he says. \"Those 27 gang-related killings in 2002 cost over \u00a330m. Cuts in funding would affect not only young black men but also Asians and whites. We're dealing with gang members from all races.\"</p> <p>Whatever the ethnic background, the mediation technique is the same. Dawes spends a lot of time finding neutral venues acceptable to both sides. It could be a community hall, a Quaker Meeting House, or even a hotel. \"We don't talk down to them,\" he says. Then he suddenly produces from the top of his enormous bag a book called The Wicked Wit of Winston Churchill, before adding: \"And we like to have a few jokes ready to ease the tension.\"</p> <p><strong>Positive view</strong></p> <p>Churchill famously observed that \"jaw-jaw\" is always better than \"war-war\". It's a sentiment that WMMTS would heartily endorse while trying to engender a more positive view of the future among gang members. \"We have to make them see what's possible,\" Dawes says. \"At the same time, we stress that if they don't give up the violence, they'll either die on the street or in prison. It helps that most of the people we deal with have kids.\"</p> <p>He has never forgotten being in a hall in Newark, New Jersey, when the comedian Bill Cosby brokered a truce between two of the biggest gangs in America, the Crips and the Bloods. \"The real catalyst for it,\" Dawes points out, \"was a prominent Crips member who returned from a funeral and asked his five-year-old what he wanted to be when he grew up. 'What do you care?' the boy replied. 'You'll be dead by then.'\" </p> <p>So is gang violence here mimicking the American way? \"Although guns are getting easier to come by over here, they're not yet as accessible as they are in the States,\" Dawes says. \"Mind you, guns are the weapon of choice in Birmingham, and that could be because of the big Jamaican influence in the city.\" </p> <p>He says this tentatively and with evident regret, as a man of Jamaican origin. His parents came from the Caribbean in the 1950s and he was born in Wolverhampton, one of six surviving children. An early memory of his is of moving to an estate in nearby Bilston, despite a petition signed by almost every resident against having a black family in the neighbourhood. \"All five of us boys learned to fight pretty quickly,\" he recalls. \"In fact, I could all too easily have become a player myself.\" </p> <p>Two factors conspired against that outcome. One was the influence of his God-fearing parents; the other was basketball - \"particularly our coach, Don Davies, who showed me that there was an alternative to the streets\".

  "<p>In the past when the rich in Britain gave to good causes they did so by sending a large yet discreet cheque. Now they start their own charities. While voluntary organisations across the country fret about the impact that a faltering UK economy will have on their income streams, Britain's richest people are increasingly involved in unprecedented levels of charitable giving. </p> <p>According to this year's Sunday Times rich list, the 1,000 wealthiest people in the UK are collectively worth over \u00a3412.8bn, a rise of nearly 15% since 2007. And as personal wealth has grown, so has their desire to give it away. In Britain, where the average person gives \u00a3150 a year to charity, the top 30 philanthropists last year committed to donate \u00a32.38bn. While that figure may be dwarfed by the generosity of philanthropists in the US - where last year the top 30 promised \u00a35.47bn - the amount is more than five times that donated by Britain's rich elite in 2006. </p> <p><strong>Personal touch</strong><br>Instead of deciding to donate their money to existing charities, growing numbers of \"venture philanthropists\" in Britain are setting up their own foundations and retaining control over how their money is spent.</p> <p>Chris Hohn, officially Britain's largest individual donor, is one of this new breed. Hohn has given \u00a3466m to The Children's Investment Fund, the foundation he started with his wife that funds projects across the developing world. </p> <p>Salvatore LaSpada, chief executive of the Institute for Philanthropy, which runs a series of programmes aimed at wealthy donors, says: \"What is increasingly defining the new wave of venture philanthropists from old-style major donors is the will to exert the same control over their charitable giving as they do their business ventures.\" La Spada says this more commercially-minded approach to giving can present issues for UK charities wanting to engage with this new breed of giver. \"Obviously the best way for venture philanthropists and charities to work together is in partnership.\" </p> <p>Charities, particularly small local voluntary groups, can often struggle to provide the \"return on investment\" in the shape of detailed and measurable outcomes expected by private sector philanthropists and manage the expectations of how much control major givers can expect to have over their charitable investments.</p> <p>Caroline Underwood, Save the Children UK's new director of philanthropy and partnerships, believes the voluntary sector has been too slow to adapt to the opportunities offered by the rise of venture philanthropy. </p> <p>\"Nothing is essentially different from what major donors wanted 20 years ago, but the expectations of venture philanthropists are a lot higher and I think the voluntary sector has been slow to respond,\" she says. \"The rise of personal foundations is a direct reflection of the desire for people to know how their money is being spent.\"</p> <p>Underwood says that charities have to become more responsive to the demands of major donors, especially at a time when corporate fundraising and individual donations are expected to decline. </p> <p>\"It's a much more crowded market than it was two decades ago and now, when we're seeing a recession looming the need to retain and keep supporters is growing more critical, especially when it comes to relationships with high-net worth individuals.\"</p> <p>As part of its drive to work more closely with venture philanthropists, Save the Children has set up initiatives to bring together groups of donors to analyse new programmes and become closely involved with them over a number of years.</p> <p><strong>More to offer than money</strong><br>John Reizenstein, an ex-investment banker, who has been helping Save the Children with one of the initiatives, says the pull of being able to contribute more than just hard cash is what brings venture philanthropists closer to charities.</p> <p>\"This idea of seeing what value you can add other than just money feeds into the desire for sustainability which is a major motivation for venture philanthropists,\" he says. \"While I can't help Save the Children do their job on the ground, I can help them articulate better to the business world, and working on a project over a number of years also means that you have that direct accountability and a sense of going further than just writing a cheque.\"</p> <p>There are now a number of established trusts and charities backed by funds from the business world, which have developed long-term, cooperative programmes. The benefits of engaging with venture philanthropy funds is that they are more likely to back innovative approaches to social change than more traditional funders, says Jim O'Neill, the Goldman Sachs executive and founder of the Shine Trust, the educational charity founded with investment from the banking community in 1999.</p> <p>\"The problem we've had is finding charities we want to fund that are willing to take those risks and are prepared to grow,\" he says. \"We have the funds, we want to make the difference, and we can help the charity sector develop some of the commercial skills that will ensure they can pull through tough economic times. Things are changing but charities have to realise they must start speaking our language if they want us to listen.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anyone who has ever wished they were an actor, a detective, an undercover agent, an investigative reporter or a global traveller would fit in perfectly at the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). </p> <p>Campaigners at the charity spend as much as six months each year working undercover all over the world to expose environmental crimes from the sale of tiger-skins in China to illegal logging in Indonesia to ivory trading in Malawi. In stark contrast to the big conservation charities like Greenpeace and the WWF, the EIA's 20 staff work in an office above Caf\u00e9 Uno on London's Upper Street, Islington, and there is barely any money for marketing. Yet, for a tiny charity, it packs an almighty punch. Since it was launched in 1984, the team has fought dozens of global environmental battles, from playing an instrumental part in the banning of the ivory trade in the late 80s to helping stamp out the illegal sale of ozone-destroying CFC chemicals in the US in the 90s.</p> <p>\"We're small, but we have a niche, and that is an investigative approach, regarding these issues as crimes,\" says campaigns director and ex-journalist Julian Newman. \"My interest is about justice - organised criminal gangs looting the planet for their own profit and nobody really doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>The EIA was set up by people who had worked for big conservation charities, and felt there was a need for a more flexible, fast-moving operation, which could get evidence of environmental offences by working undercover on the ground, and then lobby governments for change.</p> <p>\"Our philosophy is to get close to these issues and not just sit at a desk in London writing reports based on other people's reports,\" says Newman. \"Actually going out into the field and documenting how these crimes are being committed gives us a strong voice in negotiations.\"</p> <p><strong>Eyes and ears</strong><br>With all the environmental problems in the world, the EIA focuses on crimes other organisations are not investigating, which it hears about through a global network of informers as well as its own research. A vast atlas takes pride of place in the office's meeting room, and a dedicated editing suite is crammed from floor to ceiling with hundreds of tapes of undercover footage.</p> <p>Typically, a group of two or three campaigners will spend up to six months briefing themselves for undercover missions. \"It takes a lot of preparation to be get close to targets and be convincing in your role,\" says Newman. </p> <p>Staff are trained with specialist skills such as how to analyse wildlife specimens, tell the difference between real and fake skins at a second's glance and use specialist industry terminology. Campaigners then work for several weeks or months in the field, wearing secret cameras and microphones to get the evidence they need to build convincing cases. </p> <p>They become consummate actors, posing, for instance, as Western investors, timber traders or chemicals dealers, using carefully-crafted aliases and carrying phoney business cards representing dummy companies. Every member of this not-for-profit group is passionate about their work - and they have to be, given the dangers of working undercover. Although EIA has stringent safety measures in place, campaigners' work is often nerve-wracking. Only once in the last 10 years has an investigation gone wrong, when two EIA staff were discovered filming illegal logging in an Indonesian forest by the company under investigation. They were held in a room, beaten up - one lost a finger - and threatened with a gun before escaping. </p> <p><strong>Funding sources</strong><br>The EIA's trips, governmental lobbying and training of local investigative partners are funded by a small, loyal membership and grants from foundations and the Department for International Development (DfID). \"We never have enough money but we do use our money very well,\" says Newman. </p> <p>Deborah Banks, head of EIA's tiger campaign, believes that being a small not-for-profit organisation is an advantage. </p> <p>\"The one thing that keeps me here is our size,\" she stresses. 'We don't have layers and layers of bureaucracy; we can change plans. There's a tenacity about the organisation.\" </p> <p>In the offices of other, larger environmental charities, the sofa in reception might be covered with neat cushions - at the EIA, it has been turned into a makeshift bed for a sleepy campaigner who has just flown in from the US. There is no faceless corporate red tape here, just a commitment to justice.</p> <p><a href=\"www.eia-international.org\">eia-international.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Experience over many years shows that small-scale community organisations can be immensely effective in the delivery of essential, practical services: services related to homelessness, counselling, legal and other forms of advice, neighbourhood security, mental health provision and a whole host of community support programmes.</p> <p>They're particularly effective in these areas because they involve local people, with personal knowledge of the locality and its particular problems. Their local action helps to resolve national problems, and to answer national social needs, often in highly innovative ways.</p> <p>In the 1990s, many such organisations received relatively secure core funding. These days, life is altogether different. The core funding approach has been replaced in recent years by a target-driven, cost-conscious culture in which success is measured in terms of the capacity to deliver to a tick-list of centrally defined outcomes.</p> <p>Small-scale community organisations are undoubtedly under threat. But if they reorientate themselves, there is immense potential for them to flourish. If larger organisations - which increasingly control budgets - begin to understand that sub-contracting to such organisations presents the very best way of delivering both outcomes and genuine, lasting community benefit, the future of small-scale organisations is assured as a central part of the public services mix. </p> <p>Politically, there seems to be an encouraging move towards this way of thinking. This government, with its dedicated Office of the Third Sector, purports to be the sector's greatest advocate into the future. And in their recent green paper, the Tories seem to convey a real understanding of the issues. \"The conversion of grants into formal contracts with tightly specified - and monitored - terms and conditions has taken the bureaucratic approach too far,\" they say. \"It should be possible, as it is desirable, for government bodies and local authorities, who are familiar with the work of charities and voluntary bodies ... to trust them to make good use of donations - subject only to the standard requirements to demonstrate that taxpayers' money has not been used improperly.\"</p> <p>Time will tell. The acronyms, the policy statements and the papers are all complex and possibly deliberately confusing in their wording. That's why we need to adopt the simple mantra \"think national, act local\". Because local organisations are uniquely equipped to deliver the national agenda in a way that adds real value to communities: an intangible that no cost analysis can measure, but that represents a long-term investment offering incalculable benefits for the people that the government's policy seeks to serve.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ben Hughes is the chief executive of Bassac, the national network of community organisations devoted to tackling poverty, exclusion and discrimination <a href=\"www.bassac.org.uk\">bassac.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown should be careful what he wishes for. In his tub-thumping 2004 conference speech, he declared: \"I want us to build a shared national purpose, a British progressive consensus.\" He repeated the call for a \"progressive consensus\" a dozen times and for a while this was the animating Brownite theme. </p> <p>It seems the Tories were listening. Under David Cameron, the Conservatives have rebranded themselves as the party best placed to achieve \"progressive ends by Conservative means\". Cameron now claims that his party has better solutions than Labour to the problems of social injustice, poverty, inequality and unfairness. This is certainly not the consensus Brown had in mind.</p> <p>The Conservatives' claim to be a progressive party is a bold one, especially in the light of the Thatcher years. But a longer historical perspective helps. Cameron highlights Benjamin Disraeli's \"one nation\" Conservatism and William Wilberforce's campaign against slavery to show that his party can be on the side of the angels. But it speaks volumes that the Conservatives have to reach back more than a century to find their progressive forebears.</p> <p>Cameron's \"pick'n'mix\" approach to his party's history cannot disguise the fact that the establishment of the welfare state, including the National Health Service, was the single biggest progressive step in our nation's history, and which owed little to the Tories. Lloyd George laid the foundations; Atlee and Bevan finished the job. The Conservatives, at least until Thatcher, accommodated themselves to the welfare state - but they cannot claim parentage.</p> <p>It is foolish, however, to suppose that the Conservatives are prevented by some political law of gravity from being progressive in the 21st century. Successful political parties are never hostages to their past. To be progressive is to believe that societies ought to move forward, and that the measure of this advance is the expansion of freedoms and life chances for all - but especially the most disadvantaged. Iain Duncan Smith's long-standing interest in social justice helped to prepare the ground; and there are now a number of areas, including civil liberties, the environment and education policy, where the Tories can now plausibly claim to be more progressive than Labour. </p> <p>Of course there is a good dose of politics in this Conservative positioning. In their relentless efforts to lose the \"nasty party\" brand, it suits the Cameronites to be seen to care about inequality and unfairness. To some in their own party, it is all soggy liberalism. The ex-minister George Walden has suggested that, when considering an issue, Cameron asks himself: \"What would Diana have done?\"</p> <p>If he is losing friends on the right, Cameron is making them among floating voters - who like the sound of fairness and social justice, especially when it seems to be coming without a price tag - and in some unlikely corners of the left. In his outspoken attack on David Miliband last weekend, Unite's boss Derek Simpson declared: \"We might be better off with Cameron.\" </p> <p>Some Labour ministers are simply incredulous at the Conservative claims. \"People don't join the Conservative party because they are passionate about social justice,\" said one cabinet minister. Treasury minister Kitty Ussher described George Osborne's claim to stand for fairness as \"laughable\", given his policy to raise the inheritance tax threshold. The problem, though, is not that the Tories don't mean what they say about the importance of progressive goals. It is that in some key areas they have little idea how to achieve them without recourse to the state. </p> <p>The Conservative critique of Labour's policies on poverty and inequality is that they have dealt merely with the symptoms of the disease, without addressing the root causes. In his August speech on the theme of fairness, Osborne said: \"To tackle deprivation, it is not enough simply to transfer money - we need to tackle the complex mix of entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, drug and alcohol abuse, and rising indebtedness that perpetuate the cycle of poverty.\"</p> <p>An attack on poverty does require more than moving around money. But the hard fact is that, without Labour's redistributive policies, there would be much more financial hardship for the Conservatives to complain about. </p> <p>And when the Conservatives begin to flesh out their policies for tackling this \"complex mix\", the list includes an expanded health-visiting service for parents, tighter credit controls to protect people from debt, stronger rights of parental leave, and increased funding for schoolchildren from poorer backgrounds. Good stuff, but it is not clear what is especially \"Conservative\" about these approaches; indeed, such confident state action would be welcomed by those on the Labour party's left. It might help the Conservatives to accept that sometimes progressive ends can only be met by progressive means after all.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Richard Reeves is the director of Demos<br><a href=\"mailto:Richard.Reeves@demos.co.uk\">Richard.Reeves@demos.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Thai politics veers weirdly from comedy towards tragedy and then back again. Samak Sundaravej will surely go down as the only prime minister anywhere who has lost office for culinary reasons. His cookery show on television was yesterday deemed to offend against a law which stipulates that the prime minister must not engage in private business. No matter that Mr Samak did the show for fun and because it helped give him a jovial political profile, or that he gave the few baht he earned for it to his driver. Justice is not to be mocked and Mr Samak and his cabinet have to step down, although they may well all be reappointed in a couple of days after a fresh vote in parliament. </p> <p>Needless to say, it was not Mr Samak's recipe for leg of pork cooked in Coca-Cola, one of his more unwise suggestions, which constituted the real offence, but his recipe for ruling Thailand. Samak came to power as a liege man of Thaksin Shinawatra, the populist politician who dominated the political scene in Thailand before he was deposed in a military coup in 2006. The generals and their civilian allies ruled for a while and then held fresh elections, thinking that with Mr Thaksin in exile and his party banned, they could get a result to their liking. But Mr Thaksin's political party simply renamed itself, swept the board again in the polls, and put Mr Samak in his place to keep his seat warm until legal problems arising from corruption charges against him and his wife could be sorted out.</p> <p>But those who had brought down Mr Thaksin in the first place were not ready either to let him return or to allow a Thaksin government under another name to stay in power. A campaign of protests by the so-called People's Alliance for Democracy similar to that which had helped push Mr Thaksin out was now aimed at Mr Samak. The protests got larger, spilled on to the prime minister's lawn, and led to counter protests, an unfortunate development given Samak's small but well remembered role in the political crisis which led to the October 1976, massacre of students in Bangkok by rightwing militia. It is true there are some murky episodes in Mr Samak's history, but that is also the case with almost everybody else in this drama on both sides, including Mr Thaksin and General Prem Tinsulanonda, the influential adviser to the ailing King. </p> <p>Some of leaders of PAD have meanwhile demonstrated their ignorance of what they are supposedly defending by demanding an appointed corporatist legislature of the kind once favoured by European fascists. Mr Thaksin was a flawed politician who broke rules and cut corners, and Samak is his henchman, but both were elected by a large popular vote and that is, or ought to be, the bottom line.</p>",
  "<p>Contrary to Mayor Johnson Liberal Democrat AM Dee Doocey, a <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/about/members/03doocey.htm\">member</a> of the Metropolitan Police Authority, is unhappy with the Met chief's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/sep/09/police.race\">dramatic thrust</a> against his rebellious assistant. In a statement she declares herself \"stunned\" by Sir Ian's move. The background is the relevant Met committee deciding that although Ghaffur might have a misconduct case to answer - thanks to his famous <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2638956/Tarique-Ghaffur-blames-Sir-Ian-Blair-in-Scotland-Yard-racism-claim.html\">press conference</a> - there were no grounds for suspending him. Doocey is not impressed that Sir Ian has found a different way of detaching Ghaffur from organising security for the 2012 Olympics because he was \"undermining confidence in it.\" She says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Commissioner hasn't produced a shred of evidence to prove this and I'd suggest there's a much larger negative impact by his own continuing tenure at the top of the Met, which has been mired in controversy after controversy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Fellow Lib Dem and former senior Met officer Brian Paddick - the party's 2008 <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/brian-paddick-selected-to-be-london-mayor-candidate-1626.html\">mayoral candidate</a>, of course - has commented unfavourably too. \"For Ian Blair to allow the situation to reach the stage it has raises questions about his ability to lead and manage,\" says Paddick of his former boss. \"Whatever the merits of the case, blame for the damage done to the Metropolitan Police has to land at his door.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to speculate that Mayor Johnson rather envies the freedom with which these Lib Dems have spoken their minds.

  "<p>With the failure to reach verdicts in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/3\">two</a> high-profile <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/01/jury.bombings/index.html\">terror trials</a> in the last two months, jury trial in such cases is being questioned.</p> <p>This morning, certain senior officials and government ministers probably feel like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jutland#Two_points_to_port\">admiral</a> at the battle of Jutland who said \"there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today\". We have become used to the fact that on occasion obscure points of human rights law can scupper what look like common sense procedures \u2013 deporting Islamist extremists for instance. But juries are a different matter \u2013 they are held to embody the distilled fairness and impartial judgment of all of us. If they are having difficulty reaching verdicts maybe there is something amiss.</p> <p>Juries are central to English justice. Here it's 12 good men/women and true who ultimately decide criminal trials \u2013 not judges or panels of judges like the dodgy Europeans. We are proud of this. During the troubles in Northern Ireland we were forced to suspend jury trial in the province after a programme of intimidation and murder by terrorists. We had little choice, but the reputation of justice suffered nonetheless and the IRA made great hay in terms of propaganda from the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplock_courts\">Diplock courts</a> where a judge sat alone (abolished in 2007).</p> <p>If on occasion the prosecution case is not as strong as initially thought and the jury won't buy it \u2013 all well and good. That is how the system should work. Juries are not meant to be comprised of 12 Jeremy Clarkson think-alikes. The authorities will have to take it on the chin. But juries repeatedly not being convinced \"beyond reasonable doubt\" by what the prosecution (and the intelligence community and a large chunk of the general public) consider to be strong cases is a different matter altogether.</p> <p>When the verdicts came in yesterday in the airline plot trial (which the jury, despite convicting three men for conspiracy to murder were not convinced was about airliners at all) the judge complimented the jury on their efforts in effusive not just polite terms. So he was satisfied that they had done their duty. I am sure he was right. But have the authorities given any thought to the sheer complexity and grinding detail that some present-day juries have to absorb? Is there a way of making some of these cases less complicated and time-consuming without loading the dice against the defendants?</p> <p>Finally I wonder if modern juries are not susceptible to a form of silent, subconscious intimidation. After all, when they leave the secure environment of Woolwich crown court some of them might not feel that they are resuming their lives in a well-ordered society. And as we have discovered in recent months, they can't necessarily be confident that their identities and addresses will remain secret for long.</p>",
  "<p>We've had 11 years of Labour's approach to public services \u2013 centralising, micromanaging, pouring unprecedented amounts of money in through a tiny funnel in No 10 \u2013 but that's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/labour.gordonbrown\">come to an end</a>. Because New Labour is dead in the water.</p> <p>And the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/recession\">state of the economy</a> means there is no more money to pour in, no matter which party forms the government. So now is the time for new thinking about how to get more without spending more.</p> <p>When we consider changing the NHS, we must think big. It is time to deliver to England's patients the standards of personal care, individual empowerment and accountability that millions of patients elsewhere in Europe take for granted. But we must deliver that without destroying the ethos of solidarity and equality, which rightly underpins an NHS funded through progressive taxation.</p> <p>The health service budget has tripled in eight years, while services themselves have been subject to more Whitehall command-and-control and micromanagement than this country has ever seen. Yet, productivity is stagnant; outcomes are worse than in much of Europe; and health inequality is the widest since Victorian times. As the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2008/pr29/en/index.html\">World Health Organisation said</a> last month, \"social injustice is killing people on a grand scale.\"</p> <p>Labour's experiment has failed. There are two basic, structural problems with their NHS: it is too massive and centrally controlled; and because of that centralised system, we have a second basic problem, that the financial incentives all pull in the wrong direction. The more operations a hospital does, for instance, the better (under Labour) \u2013 it doesn't matter if a person is readmitted a few months later with the same problem. This is madness.</p> <p>The whole financial system on which the NHS operates is broken. So how do we fix it?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/liberaldemocrats.health\">basis of my approach</a> is to make the NHS a people's health service, with resources controlled from below, not from the top down. We want to replace centrally-set targets with personal entitlements like the ones you get in an insurance contract. Everyone should have the right to private treatment, paid for by the NHS, if the waiting time is not met.</p> <p>To give patients more control over their care, we would extend direct payments and personal budgets \u2013 so people with long-term and chronic conditions choose what care they need. </p> <p>I also believe top-up payments should be possible within the NHS. This is difficult territory. I'm concerned that people may feel the need to get expensive insurance for rare cancers they stand a one in a million chance of developing. I'm concerned the NHS may have to pick up the pieces \u2013 at great cost \u2013 if extra treatments go wrong. I'm concerned that the more people fund extra treatment, the easier it will become for the NHS to shrink to provide just a rump of \"essentials\".</p> <p>But I'm a liberal. We cannot continue to deny people the right to top up their care \u2013 particularly where they are following a clinician's advice \u2013 when the NHS has finite resources and cannot provide everything for everyone.</p> <p>I have three provisos. First, there must be no hidden costs for the NHS. So, paying for your drugs should mean also paying for treatment for any side-effects or unexpected consequences. Second, top-up payments should be limited to drugs and procedures that have been licensed and clinically recommended by your doctor. And finally, we must ensure that no PCT can use the availability of top-ups as an excuse to offer fewer drugs or treatments for free.</p> <p>So we must enshrine everyone's legal entitlements to all treatments ruled cost-effective by Nice. There must be no risk of NHS \"shrinkage\" \u2013 not now, and not in the future.</p> <p>Our NHS is at the core of what many people feel it is to be British. It's close to everyone's heart. But that affection mustn't cloud our judgment or hold us back. If we can make it a people's health service, local, flexible and accountable, I believe it can thrive through the challenges of the 21st century.</p>",

But the ambitious Irish pay-TV broadcaster believes its terrestrial rivals are guilty of trying to wage a campaign against a new force in sports broadcasting, just as they did with Sky Sports in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Despite offers from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 to buy the rights to highlights, Setanta continues to believe that the broadcasters are refusing to pay the market price and are hoping instead to bounce it into accepting a cut-price last-minute offer. </p> <p>It paid around \u00a35m for the exclusive live rights and is looking for a fifth of that for the highlights. But the free-to-air broadcasters are equally adamant that Setanta is hugely overvaluing the rights and is purposely setting a high bar in order to maintain exclusivity and drive subscriptions. Bar an unlikely last-minute compromise, a deal now looks highly unlikely.</p> <p>While there are believed to have been isolated examples of international highlights not being bought by terrestrial channels, this is the first time it has blown up into such a huge row - partly because the Croatia game is seen as such an important one. Setanta also hold the rights to the rest of England's away matches during the qualifying campaign. </p> <p>Earlier this week Labour MP John Grogan called for the rights to the highlights of qualifying matches, home and away, to be added to the government's list of protected sporting events. </p> <p>The last time there was a comparable situation, when Sky had the rights to England's climactic away clash with Turkey in 2003, the rights to the highlights were eventually sold to ITV. The FA has no control over the situation, with away matches being sold to the highest bidder by overseas football authorities often seeking a big pay day for their clash with England. </p> <p>An earlier precedent established that only the rights to highlights of \"decisive\" matches in qualifying groups were required be sold on to a free to air broadcaster, following a similar dispute over England's clash with Italy during the qualifying campaign for the 1998 World Cup under Glenn Hoddle.</p> <p>\"There is no commercial value to Setanta in holding on to the rights to the highlights at this stage. They will not increase their subscriber figures in the days before the match by withholding highlights that would run after 11pm on the same day. It seems to me they are walking into a PR disaster,\" said a senior executive at one of the terrestrial broadcasters. </p> <p>But Setanta insiders believe they now offer a good value alternative to Sky Sports and see no evidence of a public backlash.</p>",
  "<p>The US justice department has hired a top Washington lawyer to head up a possible antitrust investigation into the activities of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/google\">Google</a>.</p> <p>Sanford Litvack, the well-known litigator, will be advising the government as it prepares a case challenging a recent advertising deal between Google and its Silicon Valley rival, Yahoo.</p> <p>The arrangement, which was made in June and lets Google sell advertising on Yahoo's site in return for a share of profits, has been widely criticised for handing even more power to the dominant force in internet advertising. One analysis suggests that it could result in Google having control of more than 80% of the American online advertising market.</p> <p>In a statement, Google said that it believed the impact would be much less drastic than predicted, and hoped that government officials would not kill the deal. </p> <p>\"While there has been a lot of speculation about this agreement's potential impact on advertisers or ad prices, we think it would be premature for regulators to halt the agreement before we implement it and everyone can judge the actual impact,\" it said.</p> <p>Meanwhile Yahoo responded by saying that it was monitoring the news but that \"we remain confident that the deal is lawful\".</p> <p>Litvack, 72, a former vice-chairman of Disney, has deep connections inside the technology industry. He was previously a board member of computer manufacturers Hewlett Packard and Compaq, and was also an assistant attorney general in the justice department's antitrust division during the late 1970s.</p> <p>It remains unclear what the scope of any possible antitrust investigation will be, with speculation that the government could widen its remit to examine Google's increasingly powerful reach across the internet industry.</p> <p>The announcement of the advertising deal in June was primarily seen as an attempt to disrupt Microsoft's $44bn (\u00a325.2bn) attempt to buy Yahoo. That gambit proved ultimately successful, as the takeover was rejected soon afterwards. But the nature of the Google-Yahoo deal left a bitter taste in the mouths of many industry insiders.</p> <p>Complaints about the pact were widespread, including from the Association of National Advertisers, which represents more than 400 companies including Ford and Wal-Mart. Microsoft, too, protested strongly over the implications of the deal.</p> <p>\"Never before in the history of advertising has one company been in a position to control prices on up to 90% of advertising in a single medium,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, told a US congressional committee in July. \"Not in television, not in radio, not in publishing. It should not happen on the internet.\"</p> <p>That brought echoes of Microsoft's notorious antitrust case of the 1990s, which saw government lawyers primarily focused on the anti-competitive practices involving the Seattle-based company's web browser, Internet Explorer.</p> <p>The Microsoft investigation almost led to the break-up of the company \u2014 until the arrival of George Bush in the White House in 2001, which saw the government backtrack and reach an alternative settlement.</p> <p>At the same time as news of Litvack's appointment was made public, Google also announced a series of initiatives it hoped would boost its public image as it hits its 10th anniversary.</p> <p>The Californian firm announced today that it was joining forces with HSBC and John Malone, the communications expert and Liberty Media boss, to create a new company, O3b, which would focus on bringing internet access to the developing world.</p> <p>The new group plans to provide an extensive network of new satellites, dedicated to offering a web connection to the \"other 3 billion\" people who cannot access a traditional internet line.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google also sought to allay fears over privacy by announcing that it would be cutting the length of time that it holds on to personally identifiable information on users in half, to just nine months. </p> <p>The company has been slowly reducing the longevity of its logs on people's internet activities, in what has become a cat- and-mouse game with regulators around the world.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama today called for new government funding for schools that operate outside the traditional state-sponsored educational system, effectively embracing one of John McCain's signature proposals.</p> <p>Obama pledged to double the amount spent on so-called charter schools, which enjoy autonomy from the strictures governing most state-sponsored schools.</p> <p>In remarks in Dayton, Ohio, today, Obama presented education reform as one of the most pressing issues facing the next president.</p> <p>\"Our kids and our country can't afford four more years of neglect and indifference,\" he said in prepared remarks. \"At this defining moment in our history, America faces few more urgent challenges than preparing our children to compete in a global economy.\"</p> <p>Charter schools have become a flashpoint between educators who want to shake up what they say is a system controlled by bureaucrats and teachers' unions and those who fear they will drain resources and energy from traditional state schools.</p> <p>Opponents of charter schools say they siphon money, teachers and students from other state-sponsored schools, creating a two-tiered system of free education in which the most motivated parents place their children in charter schools. Some educators are wary of for-profit schools, which are allowed in certain states.</p> <p>Conservative backers of charter schools say they encourage competition and innovation in traditional state-sponsored schools, and force bureaucracies and teachers unions to accept reform.</p> <p>\"When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children,\" John McCain said in a speech last week. McCain went on to accuse Obama of ceding control of the nation's state-sponsored schools to teachers unions and \"entrenched bureaucracies,\" a message the Democratic candidate today sought to quash.</p> <p>Charter schools have blossomed across the country, beginning with two in Minnesota in 1991. By 2004, more than 3,000 had opened in 37 states, serving more than 750,000 students, according to the National Education Association, a teachers union that welcomes charter schools but remains cautious about the concept.</p> <p>Under his new plan, Obama would double federal funding for charter schools, paying particular attention to \"high-needs\" school districts, and limiting funding to states that \"improve accountability\" for the schools and intervene in failing charter schools. The federal government currently spends about $200m a year on charter schools. </p> <p>Among other measures, Obama would promote university-level coursework in high schools, boost financial aid for university students, and purchase computers and other technology for the classroom. </p> <p>He would also boost teacher pay, with raises for veteran instructors and teachers who work in \"underserved\" schools. Obama also endorsed the idea of so-called \"merit pay,\" an idea typically opposed by the Democratic-leaning teachers unions.</p> <p>\"When our teachers succeed in making a real difference in our children's lives, we should reward them for it by finding new ways to increase teacher pay that are developed with teachers, not imposed on them,\" he said. \"We can do this. From Prince George's County in Maryland to Denver, Colorado, we're seeing teachers and school boards coming together to design performance pay plans.\"</p> <p>Obama struck out at McCain in his speech today, saying the Arizona Republican has been in Washington for 26 years and \"he has not done one thing to truly improve the quality of public education in our country. Not one real proposal or law or initiative. Nothing\".</p> <p>Obama also unveiled a television advert accusing McCain of voting in the Senate to cut education funding and proposing to abolition the federal department of education.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama understands what it takes to make America No 1 in education again,\" the advert says. \"John McCain doesn't understand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Counter-terrorism police and intelligence officers are said to be astonished that a jury did not convict eight Britons of planning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/6\"> to blow up seven airliners</a> across the Atlantic. Three men were found guilty on Monday of conspiracy to murder, but not of any particular plot. The jury did not agree on the key allegation \u2013 that they were planning the biggest terrorist attack since the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.</p> <p>Dismayed, counter-terrorism officers may have been. However, other forces were in play. Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yard's counter terrorism command throughout the investigation, offers a clue. \"On the evening of August 9 2006\", <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4710870.ece\">he wrote in the Times newspaper</a>, \"I was told that a man connected to the British terrorists had been arrested in Pakistan. This was not good news\".</p> <p>It certainly was not. The man in question, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashid_Rauf\">Rashid Rauf</a> was arrested in Pakistan at the request of the Americans. It was not what the police and MI5 wanted. MI5 in particular was keen to continue its surveillance operation. The alarm which Rauf's arrest triggered among the alleged plotters meant that there was no alternative but to arrest them as soon as possible before they took evasive action. </p> <p>British security and intelligence officials are extraordinarily sensitive to any suggestion that they are in any way critical of their US counterparts. However, officials familiar with the \"airline plot\" investigation make it clear they were seriously concerned about the US's approach. As soon as they were told about the alleged plot, the American authorities wanted immediate arrests.</p> <p>Michael Clarke, the director of the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the pressure for early arrests may have come from President Bush \u2013 even though he had reportedly been advised to wait by the then prime minister, Tony Blair.</p> <p>As Clarke remarked, the case reflected the different approaches of the British and the Americans. \"The United States say they are in a 'war against terror' and all they want to do is smash any conspiracies. What we're concerned with is a criminal justice approach. What we want is evidence that would be admissible in court because for us this is an issue of criminality\". Clarke added: \"For the British, the evidence will never be better than the night before the plot is sprung. For the Americans when you see a plot you break it.\"</p> <p>Peter Clarke appeared to have a dig at the US in his Times column. He referred to the sophistication of modern evidence-gathering here. He added: \"No need for military commissions or the juryless Diplock courts of Northern Ireland\". Diplock courts have gone, but military commissions is what the US has at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Counter-terrorism officials often refer to the tension between the desire to get more evidence from intelligence-gathering operations and the overriding responsibility of the police to safeguard the public. </p> <p>Today, they also referred to international operations where the situation \"is not entirely under our control\". </p> <p>The jury in the \"airliner plot\" case deliberated for many, many, days. To criticise its failure to reach a verdict on the key allegation as perverse is itself perverse. It reflects a dangerous presumption that dramatic terrorist-related allegations must be true whatever the evidence.</p>",

  "<p>Semillon has, in its time, been the world's most planted white grape, capable of producing top-quality wines, but it is now widely undervalued. As well as making some of the world's greatest sweet wines in Bordeaux, it is responsible for the region's best dry whites (of Graves and Pessac-Leognan), usually blended with sauvignon blanc, and Australia's most distinctive table wine, Hunter Valley semillon. It blends well with sauvignon because it lacks positive aroma but makes up for sauvignon's lack of body. If it is picked before it reaches full ripeness, it can almost taste like sauvignon. Semillon's thin skins make it prone to rot, and so it is an ideal producer of botrytised sweet wines, not just in Bordeaux and Monbazillac, but also in New South Wales and occasionally California.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Semillon is the great white grape of sweet white Bordeaux, namely Sauternes, arguably the world's longest-living white wine. It is also sanctioned in most of the dry or sweet white wine appellations of south-west France, yet outside Sauternes it seems destined to play a supplementary role, increasingly just ballast to the more aromatic sauvignon blanc. </p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>In Australia, semillon has been used to stretch the available quantities of chardonnay while new plantings come on stream, initiating a category known as \"semchard\". Australia has also taken perhaps the most positive line on constructing varietals, rather than blends, out of this grape - notably Hunter Valley's light, age-worthy examples. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>Semillon is planted in virtually all of the world's wine regions, but for the moment little is made of it, even though old vines and cooler subregions in South Africa have shown great potential. Odd varietal versions have shone in Hungary, New Zealand and Washington state. Semillon is also widely planted in Chile, though very little is exported.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore's recommendations</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong><br> <strong>Peter Lehmann Barossa Semillon 2005, Australia</strong><br><strong>\u00a36.99 Oddbins, \u00a35.99 Tesco, \u00a36.18 Asda</strong><br> Age is starting to lend this dry, unoaked white a mellow toastyness. <br>It smells like the inside of a new handbag, and moves in a shallow arc through your mouth with a tang of preserved lemons and the <br>freshness of white blossom. </p> <p><strong>One to lust after </strong></p> <p><strong>Waitrose Sauternes 2005, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a39.99 for 37.5cl, Waitrose</strong></p> <p>A delicious take on this famous sweet white wine, made by Chateau Suduiraut.

  "<p>Pinot gris is wildly popular today, especially when given its Italian name, pinot grigio. At low yields, it can make deep-coloured, full-bodied, gently aromatic wines with lots of extract, but it is much more commonly encountered as a crisp, only vaguely aromatic commercial white. A pink-skinned version of pinot noir, it can create wines that are almost rose in colour. In the vineyard, this vine can easily be taken for pinot noir, and once habitually grew in among the pinot noir of Burgundian vineyards, adding softness and sometimes acidity to its red wines. As pinot beurot, it is still sanctioned as an ingredient in most of Burgundy's red wine appellations. Wines from this grape are generally best drunk young, though some pinot gris may be stashed away for a few years.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p>Italians today grow far more pinot grigio than pinot bianco, and most have the habit of picking it before it can develop any interesting characteristics. The most concentrated plantings are in the cool north-east, where high yields tend to make rather neutral wines. The top Friuli producers, however, can fashion something special from it. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>In Alsace, pinot gris, unlike pinot blanc, is revered as a noble grape and can produce commandingly rich wines. These range from almost bone-dry, through vendange tardive (\"late harvest\"), to SGN (\"selection of noble berries\" - ie, noble rot) levels of ripeness. The drier of these wines are some of the finest whites to drink with rich savoury food. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>The most pinot gris is grown in Germany, where it was traditionally called rulander if sweet, although it's now more commonly known by its dry name, grauburgunder (it's dry, therefore fashionable). Pinot gris is known as malvoisie in the Loire and Switzerland (where its innate smoky flavours survive). It is grown thoughout central Europe and has shown real form in Oregon. It is very popular with Californian growers, and is rapidly becoming a speciality in New Zealand.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore's recommendations</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong><br> <strong>Riff Pinot Grigio 2007, Italy</strong><br><strong>\u00a36.48, Asda</strong></p> <p>Made in the foothills of the Dolomites in northern Italy, this has subtle nectarine and citrus flavours, and is crisp, clean and thirst-slaking.

  "<p>The pink-skinned gew\u00fcrztraminer is grown all over the world to produce deep-coloured, full-bodied whites with the distinctive smell of lychees and rose petals, veering towards bacon fat in very ripe examples. For many wine drinkers, this (or sauvignon blanc) is the first varietal they learn to identify - it is far easier to recognise, even just by smell, than it is to spell. It invariably ripens to a high alcohol level (over 14% is common) and can lose acidity dangerously.</p> <p>Although there is probably much confusion, especially in newer wine regions, strictly speaking gew\u00fcrztraminer is the aromatic or musque version of a pink-berried traminer, and certainly the Italians distinguish between traminer and traminer aromatico. Its roots lie in the village of Tramin in Alto Adige, northern Italy. Vines called variants of traminer are planted throughout central Europe, as well as Russia, Moldova and Ukraine, where it is sometimes used to perfume sparkling wine. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Gew\u00fcrztraminer's stronghold is Alsace, where it is occasionally known as some sort of klevner. In addition to aromatic yet dry whites, it can produce sweeter late-harvest wines more reliably than any of the region's other three noble grape varieties - riesling, pinot gris and muscat - which will be labelled vendange tardive or selection de grains nobles in sunnier years. It is the second most planted grape in Alsace after riesling, and the most widely planted in the more famous vineyards of the Haut\u2011Rhin departement. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>Winemakers of all nationalities like to play with gew\u00fcrztraminer, and fine examples can be found in Washington, Oregon, Chile and New Zealand, as well as northern Italy. Germany relegates its roter traminer to a minor rank, well behind riesling.

  "<h2>Spain</h2> <p>Palomino, or palomino fino to distinguish it from the coarser palomino basto it has replaced, is the sherry grape, grown around Jerez in southern Spain.

  "<p>Riesling must be the world's most misunderstood, and mispronounced, grape variety. Acknowledged king of German vineyards, it happens to share a name with so many more ordinary, unrelated grapes and wines (such as Cape riesling, Clare riesling, emerald riesling, riesling Italico and Welschriesling) that its image became tarnished. And, it must be said, the Germans themselves have made some pretty awful rieslings at the bottom end of the market that have done nothing for the reputation of their greatest asset. </p> <p>Good wine made from riesling is quite unlike any other. It is light in alcohol, seeringly high in fruity natural acidity, has the ability to transmit the character of a place through its extract and unique aroma and, unlike chardonnay, is capable of ageing for decades in bottle. Indeed, riesling could claim to be the finest white grape in the world on the basis of the longevity of its wines and their expression of place. </p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>Riesling ripens quite early, so when planted in a hot climate its juice can be overripe and flabby long before any interesting flavours have developed in the grapes. In a cool climate, such as that of Germany's Mosel, Nahe, Rheingau and Pfalz regions, on the other hand, it can stay on the vine well into autumn, developing all sorts of subtle and age-worthy characteristics. Until recently, German riesling was often so tart that it needed some sweetness in the wine to balance the acidity, but climate change has meant that grapes ripen much more successfully, and some seriously fine dry (trocken) rieslings are made. Their perfume and raciness can make them particularly food-friendly - often more so than a heavier, oak-aged white. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Riesling is also the noblest variety of Alsace, France's most Germanic region, and the only part of the country where this vine is officially allowed. Riesling accounts for more than 20% of the area under vine in Alsace, and plantations are steadily increasing, mainly in place of sylvaner. The best of the region's tingly-dry, steely wines, such as Trimbach's Clos Ste-Hune, can age for a decade or two in bottle. There is a slight talcum powder aroma about the least concentrated examples of Alsace riesling, but these are great wines to drink as aperitifs (as, indeed, are all but the sweetest rieslings made anywhere). </p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>Surprisingly, in view of its relatively warm climate, Australia grows an enormous amount of Rhine riesling, once colloquially called simply \"Rhine\". Indeed, riesling was the most planted white wine grape variety until chardonnay caught up with it in 1990. Its perfect spots are in the cooler reaches of south Australia, notably but not exclusively Clare Valley and Eden Valley whose bone-dry rieslings can be quite steely and super-tangy, although the far south of Western Australia makes some interesting herbal-scented examples, too.</p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>The Wachau in Austria rivals Alsace and the Mosel for the purity of its rieslings, except that these wonderfully characterful, bone-dry, sculpted wines tend to have a bit more body. Much of central Europe has suitable spots for ripening riesling, whose local name usually incorporates some variant on the word Rhine (in Croatia it is known as rizling rajinski). True riesling (as opposed to Italian riesling) is widely dispersed in Friuli and Alto Adige, in north-east Italy, where it is called riesling renano, although few startling examples have so far emerged. Riesling is also allegedly grown widely in the old Soviet Union, but much of this may be Welschriesling. </p> <p>New Zealand's rieslings are developing and some fine sweet wines are made. In California, only the odd cooler region can make fine examples, but both Oregon and Washington state can produce some extremely delicate, toothsome, off-dry rieslings. Both Ontario in Canada and, especially, the Finger Lakes region in New York state can turn out fine dry versions, while Canada's icewines from frozen riesling grapes fetch extremely high prices. Be aware that riesling-sylvaner is a misleading name for muller-thurgau used in New Zealand, while rizling is a term used at the Germans' insistence for Welschriesling to distinguish it from the riesling that is their pride and joy.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore's recommendations</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>Leitz Rudesheimer Burgweg</strong><br><strong>Riesling Kabinett 2007, Germany \u00a38.19, Tesco</strong></p> <p>To me, a German riesling seems to waltz while one from Australia tends to soar and circle with the direct purpose of a bird of prey.

Its taste is also an exact balance, in terms of intensity, for the smell, which makes it satisfying to sip. <br><strong>Victoria Moore</strong></p> <h2>Drink with</h2> <p>While most European cooking proves pretty straightforward for wine matching, south-east Asian cookery definitely does not. With many <br>dishes containing palm sugar, lime juice, fish sauce and bird's eye <br>chillies (sweet, sour, salty and hot all in one go), you can probably <br>appreciate that few wine styles are up to the job. Riesling is the <br>exception. Look for examples with some degree of sweetness - <br>Germany is home to the best of these.

  "<p>Forty years ago, the viognier grape was virtually extinct. Even 25 years ago, the total area of viognier vines planted in the world was barely 30 hectares (80 acres), and almost all of them were in the little village of Condrieu in France's northern Rhone. Ten years ago, only the cognoscenti had heard of it. Today, however, it is extremely fashionable, and set to become still more so. While the vine can yield poorly in cooler climates, it is now planted all over southern France, in California, Australia and wherever a cosmopolitan wine producer lurks. The grapes are a deep yellow and the resulting wines are full-bodied and high in alcohol, with a very distinctive scent of dried apricots, blossom and, almost, musk. The wine is usually best drunk young, before its relatively low acidity fades.</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>The northern Rhone appellations of Condrieu and Chateau Grillet are the longest-established sources of viognier wines, but the vine is planted well beyond appellation boundaries, including in the Languedoc. The tradition in Cote Rotie, just north of Condrieu, of fermenting a small proportion of viognier with syrah has recently been resdiscovered. </p> <h2>Elsewhere</h2> <p>Australian producers have recently welcomed viognier, both as a varietal white and a 5-10% blend with shiraz. The Californian way with it is a notably alcoholic one, but these monsters can be magnificent. There has also been experimentation with it all over North America, as well as South, particularly in Uruguay. While Italy's plantings are very modest, its blends of viognier and chardonnay have had success.</p> <h2>Victoria Moore's recommendations</h2> <p><strong>One to drink now</strong></p> <p><strong>La Difference Viognier Muscat 2007, France</strong><br><strong>\u00a35.25, Tesco, Sainsbury's</strong> </p> <p>A just off-dry, girlish feel-good wine that's all Charentais melon <br>and grapey pleasure (the viognier is blended with 30% muscat, one of the few grapes to make wines that actually taste of grapes).

Keralan cooking in particular - lighter, <br>fresher - is home to some very wine-friendly dishes, and the region's fish curries make perfect viognier partners. <br><strong>Matt Skinner</strong></p> <h2>Background</h2> <p><strong>Say it right</strong> Vee-on-yeah </p> <p><strong>Makes</strong> weighty, high-alcohol wines, with floral, peach and apricot aromas </p> <p><strong>Hotspots</strong> Rhone, California, Eden Valley in Australia </p> <p><strong>Good companions</strong> Because of its strong aroma, viognier can withstand blending well.

Used to play for Chelsea, not that notoriously fickle 'Ammers fans will mind if he turns out to be any good.</p> <p><strong>Zola Budd:</strong> Famously barefoot British distance runner from Bloemfontein, Orange Free State in South Africa.<br> <strong>Pros:</strong> Won't let players' heads be turned by talk of boot deals. Not afraid of employing rough-house tactics in the heat of battle. <br> <strong>Cons:</strong> Was encouraged to come and work in Britain in the 1980s by the Daily Mail, a newspaper no longer renowned for the welcome it extends to unemployed foreigners.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I know David has spoken well of Preston North End over the years.

It's almost like he thinks he's one of us when he's winning and a foreigner when he's losing. Which is typical of a bitter Scotsman.</p> <p>Anyway, it seems this perfidious thinking has knacked the mental process of the underperforming British players in Fabio Capello's squad, who are nowhere near as good as their English counterparts who won the World Cup in 1966.

  "<p>McLaren have lodged a formal appeal against the penalty that dropped Lewis Hamilton from first to third place in Sunday's Belgian grand prix.</p> <p>The team's decision to proceed with the appeal was buttressed by the fact that Charlie Whiting, the FIA race director, apparently twice reassured the McLaren team that he was satisfied with the way in which Hamilton had allowed Kimi Raikkonen to overtake his McLaren after it had straight-lined the chicane immediately before the pits.</p> <p>\"From the pit wall, we then asked race control to confirm that they were comfortable that Lewis had allowed Kimi to repass,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren chief operating officer, \"and they confirmed twice that they believed that the position had been given back in a manner that was 'OK'.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If race control had instead expressed any concern regarding Lewis's actions at that time, we would have instructed Lewis to allow Kimi to repass for a second time.\" </p> <p>There is no time for the FIA to convene a meeting of its international court of appeal before this weekend's Italian grand prix at Monza, but it is expected to adjudicate on the matter before the inaugural Singapore grand prix on September 28.</p> <p>The court has the power, if persuaded by McLaren's argument, to restore the original. For his part, Hamilton claimed yesterday that the reason he squeezed over the left-hand kerb at the pits chicane was to avoid a collision with Raikkonen's Ferrari rather than gain any unsporting advantage.</p> <p>\"In the closing stages of the race I was catching Kimi consistently, lap by lap, and with three laps remaining I got close enough to attempt to overtake him on the entry to the last chicane,\" he explained. \"I managed to get slightly ahead of him in the braking area for the first apex of the chicane.</p> <p>\"He fought back approaching the second apex - but, in doing so, he left no room for me on the inside line. The only way for me to avoid a collision was therefore to cut inside the second apex.\"</p> <p>As things stand, Hamilton goes into the Italian grand prix leading rival Felipe Massa by two world championship points rather than the eight he believed he had after being first past the chequered flag in Belgium. It is now up to the governing body to support or overturn the controversial decision of their stewards.<br> Surinder Thathi, one of the three stewards at the Belgian grand prix, has emphasised there was no conspiracy against the McLaren team.</p> <p>\"We acted professionally and within the FIA rules. Hamilton took a short cut inside of the corner while off the track,\" said Thati. \"We had a choice to mete out a time penalty or 10 grid places in the next grand prix race. We opted for the former and handed a time penalty of 25 seconds.</p> <p>\"I know I am a very unpopular person in the United Kingdom now, but then I was doing my job and I know I acted professionally.\"<br></p>",

Just because 79% think the country is going in the <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/right_direction_wrong_track/right_direction_or_wrong_track\">wrong direction</a> doesn't mean they all want it to go in the same direction. And the fact that Bush's <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/political_updates/president_bush_job_approval\"> approval ratings</a> are at 34% means there is a solid third of the country who will pretty much believe whatever they want to believe.</p> <p>Obama is a late finisher. Six weeks before the Iowa caucuses <a href=\"http://people-press.org/reports/questionnaires/374.pdf\">he trailed (pdf)</a> Clinton by 6% in Iowa, 19% in New Hampshire and 14% in South Carolina. We all know how that turned out. His campaign relies on field offices and grassroots contact, which takes longer and is more of a slow burn.</p> <p>But finally, and most importantly, the polls that really matter are not the national but the state polls. The US presidential election is not really a national election but 50 separate local ones. And on that front, even after the conventions Obama is in a commanding position. Obama needs 18 electoral college votes \u2013 more than John Kerry \u2013 to win. According to <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/\">pollster.com</a> there is not a single state that Kerry won where McCain is ahead. Conversely, there are two that Bush won \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/map/polling/\">Iowa and New Mexico</a> \u2013 where Obama maintains a commanding lead. That's 12 electoral votes. Then there are two \u2013 Michigan and New Hampshire \u2013 that Kerry won where Obama holds slight leads but which are toss-ups. That's 21 electoral votes. Then there are eight that Bush won \u2013 Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina \u2013 which are toss-ups. Obama narrowly leads in four, McCain narrowly leads in three. One, Virginia, is a dead heat. That's 95 electoral votes.</p> <p>In other words, Obama is fighting this election entirely on McCain's territory. McCain is struggling to defend what he has. If they split those toss-ups even 80-20 in McCains' favour he still loses the election.</p> <p>That doesn't mean Obama's going to walk it. First of all, this year more than most polls are likely to be uniquely unreliable. White people have routinely lied to pollsters about their propensity to vote for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\">black candidate</a> in a bid to hide their racism. Meanwhile, Obama's base is heavily built on the young and the black who historically have been less likely to turn up than others. One may cancel the other out. The truth is, nobody really knows. (There is some reason to believe the Bradley effect \u2013 also known as the <a href=\"http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~dhopkins/wilder13.pdf\">Wilder effect (pdf)</a> \u2013 no longer holds. I'll believe it when I see it).</p> <p>In any case, there's a while to go before election day and it is perfectly possible that Obama will lose each roll of the dice. But it's unlikely. What it does mean is that the people who should really be panicking \u2013 and who clearly really are panicking because otherwise they wouldn't have picked Sarah Palin as a vice-presidential nominee \u2013 are the Republicans. I know which position I would rather be in. Democrats, meanwhile, should have a bit more faith that they have picked the right candidate. <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-vote.com</a>, which uses a different method for calculating the slew of polls each day, projects an Obama victory of 281 to McCain's 230 with 27 votes tied. This time back in <a href=\"http://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2004/Pres/Maps/Sep09.html\">2004</a> they projected Bush on 254 and Kerry on 243 with 41 votes tied. The good news is they got the numbers, if not the individual states, pretty much right back then. The bad news is all the tied votes went to Bush.</p>",
  "<p>They'll struggle to wring many headlines out of this ECB announcement. Having been spoiled for stories over the past six months the cricket media are now faced with one of the least surprising squad selections in recent memory, conforming almost exactly to the pundits' predictions. The stand-out decisions \u2013 the inclusion of Michael Vaughan in the central contracts list and of Ryan Sidebottom in the Stanford Super Series squad \u2013 were as easy to forecast as the August rains.</p> <p>As if they wanted to pour more water on the fire the selectors have swerved<br>further controversy by choosing the same 15 men for both the Stanford<br>matches and the one-day tour of India. It means there is space for both Alastair Cook and Ravi Bopara, and for Sidebottom and Steve Harmison. The only man to miss out from the recent one-day series over South Africa is Tim<br>Bresnan, and as he has taken only four wickets in his six international matches he hardly has good cause for complaint. Even Bresnan may yet return if Sidebottom fails to recover from the hip problem that has afflicted him in recent weeks.</p> <p>More significant than either the Test or the Stanford squads may be the incremental contracts handed to Tim Ambrose, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel,<br>Matthew Prior, Owais Shah, Graeme Swann and Luke Wright, which will mean the ECB taking increasing control of the players' time and wages as they make further appearances for the national teams. England, it seems, have identified a nucleus of elite players for the next 12 months, meaning that it might be a while before we enjoy another DJ Pattinson.</p> <p>Given that players' egos and neuroses are going to need such careful management as the Stanford series unfolds, it is right that the selectors have avoided rash decisions. Even those omitted from that squad \u2013 Phil Mustard and Dimitri Mascarenhas will be rueing the manner in which they've drifted out of contention over 2008 \u2013 can take consolation from the fact that the Stanford Series is scheduled to run for the next five years. There will be future opportunities to cash in.</p> <p>An interesting aside to events in Antigua will be the performance of Andrew Strauss when Middlesex take on England. Otherwise, with that four-nil win over South Africa so fresh in the memory, the selection questions were all too easy to answer. Samit Patel and Harmison both did well enough to ensure their selection for the money match.</p> <p>Similarly, Kevin Pietersen's public confirmation that he wanted Vaughan to be available for the Test team ensured that we were also denied the pleasure of mulling over the merits of his case for inclusion. Regardless of what the rest of us thought, Pietersen and the management have never given any suggestion that Vaughan would be denied a contract. It was not even as though there was a convincing argument to be made for another batsmen in his place. His contribution as an ice-cool senior pro would certainly be a worthwhile temper to Pietersen's headstrong leadership style.</p> <p>The prospect of an unburdened Vaughan returning to anything like his best form with the bat is enticing enough to make his inclusion worthwhile, to say nothing of the debt of loyalty owed to him for his years of service. It is a shame that similar logic didn't apply in the case of England's other open secret \u2013 the end of Matthew Hoggard's Test career. There are few players in the history of the England team who have contributed so much and yet been discarded so abruptly and with so little ceremony. In contrast, Vaughan has been granted a chance to prove that the whispers about his declining eyesight and malfunctioning footwork were the product of the stress the captaincy was putting him under rather than the rust of age and fatigue.</p> <p>Somehow, though nothing would please me more than to watch Vaughan bat like he once did, I think it unlikely that he will thrive. Mike Atherton, who played a further 36 Tests after stepping down from the captaincy, actually averaged less in that time than he did over his whole career, which rather spoils the idea that he enjoyed a renaissance of form when he gave up leadership. Admittedly Atherton's health problems were more severe than<br>Vaughan's, but unless his form reaches its majestic best the case it is easy to imagine that the draw of earning some serious cash of his own in the Sky commentary box may well be too strong to resist.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\">Chrome</a> is all the news this week: a new browser from the world's foremost internet company, Google. It's no secret that the nonprofit, free, open <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\">Firefox</a> browser depends largely on Google's financial largesse and technical contributions, so lots of Firefox diehards are understandably nervous about what this might mean for the future of everyone's favourite free browser.</p> <p>Here's what's got me worried: Google has a vested interest in ensuring that your browser doesn't always do what you tell it to do. Tools like ad-blockers, plugins that let you change the way search results are presented, improved cookie-managers, and tools that let you print pages from Google Book Search are all examples of the kind of thing that is readily available in Firefox, but which Google seems unlikely to want to implement for Chrome.</p> <p>Here're some things that my Firefox does that Google probably doesn't want:</p> <p>\u2022 Automatically logs me out of Google when I do searches, but logs me back in again when I want to access my Google Spreadsheets documents \u2013 thus Google loses the ability to use cookies to track my travels over the web and my searches, but I retain the convenience of accessing my shared documents without having to remember to log in again</p> <p>\u2022 Rewrites Google Image Search pages to direct-link all the thumbnails to the full-size images</p> <p>\u2022 Changes the Google logo to a \"Gulag\" logo showing Google's place as part of the Great Firewall of China, providing a constant reminder to me that for all that I trust Google with lots of key data, I must never forget that it has demonstrated a historical corporate willingness to participate in censorship and surveillance efforts when its profits were on the line</p> <p>\u2022 Blocks Google Adword ads</p> <p>\u2022 Rewrites the style sheets on Google Book Search pages to make it easy to print and save the scanned-in book-pages.</p> <p>All of this is legal, and all of it comes under the general category of getting my browser to act in my interest, rather than Google's. This dynamic \u2013 the struggle between companies to control public behaviour and access to information, and the public's resistance to control and surveillance \u2013 is the thing that makes \"don't be evil\" more than a laughable corporate motto.

  "<p>Gordon Brown today admitted it was time to \"adapt and rethink\" Labour's policies as he attempts to revive his party's fortunes ahead of the autumn conference season.</p> <p>The prime minister conceded the government \"must do more\" after Labour has suffered a series of byelection defeats and dire poll ratings</p> <p>Echoing his speech in Downing Street on the day he took over as PM 15 months ago, Brown expressed his desire for change in \"the way we govern\".</p> <p>In a pre-conference article for <a href=\"http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/brown-admits-labour-must-rethink-policy\">the Monitor</a> magazine, the prime minister stressed that the economic challenges facing the UK were global in nature.</p> <p>He went on: \"I believe that Britain is well placed to withstand the shocks that these transformations bring, but if we are to seize on the opportunities these new challenges present, then the country, the government, and New Labour must do more.</p> <p>\"Whether global or domestic, deep-seated or just fleeting, the pressures that we face in the short term and the long term have all changed since New Labour first came into government.</p> <p>\"And so, the way we govern must change too. That is why in Manchester this year it is time to adapt and rethink New Labour policy.\"</p> <p>Brown also described his determination to demonstrate he can provide the leadership required.</p> <p>\"What I ask of our country, our government, and our party, cannot be done without leadership.</p> <p>\"So, at conference in Manchester and in the weeks that follow, I will set out how I - and our party, and our government, and our country - must rise to conquer those challenges and to ensure fairness for all,\" he said.</p> <p>The prime minister also acknowledged that improvements in social mobility under Labour had not matched expectations and had to be stepped up.</p> <p>\"We need to be honest with ourselves: while poverty has been reduced and the rise in inequality halted, social mobility has not improved in Britain as we would have wanted,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A child's social class background at birth is still the best predictor of how well he or she will do at school and later on in life.</p> <p>\"Our ambitions for a fairer Britain cannot be satisfied in the face of these injustices.\"</p>",
  "<p>When listening to vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94258995\">talk of reform</a>, it's easy to miss that she is firmly embedded in the same movement that gave the US its last disastrous eight years of policies based on faith rather than reason. As a member of the religious right, Palin has a unique stand about when and why the government can intervene in the lives of ordinary Americans.</p> <p>One of Palin's more disconcerting attempts to foster her own sense of decency and morality is her advocacy of abstinence-only sex education in public schools. During her gubernatorial run in Alaska, the <a href=\"http://eagleforumalaska.blogspot.com/\">Eagle Forum Alaska</a>, a conservative \"pro-family\" group, asked this of Palin: \"Will you support funding for abstinence-until-marriage education instead of for explicit sex-education programmes, school-based clinics and the distribution of contraceptives in schools?\"</p> <p>Her answer: \"Yes, the explicit sex-ed programmes will not find my support.\" How nice it is that the Eagle Forum has the ethic of full disclosure. They've removed Palin's answer from their blog.</p> <p>It shouldn't be surprising that Palin's position is directly tied to her religious ideology. She's an <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jCeGgS4vbVt6qpxTpahCgGn_R-dQD92VOKVG0\">evangelical Christian</a> who believes the Bible is the inerrant word of God and that she has a personal relationship with his divine majesty. The Bible, therefore, is the wellspring of right morality. And those that do not choose to put their noses in between this particular book's binding will be made to do so, or they will have it smashed closed on them.</p> <p>Much has been made of Palin's endorsement of abstinence-only education considering her daughter's pregnancy, but Bristol Palin should be left out of it. She needn't factor into the legitimate public debate that pits abstinence-only sex education versus comprehensive sex education, which, mind you, discusses abstinence, as it should.</p> <p>What matters in this debate is that Palin doesn't want teenagers to have such knowledge, because it offends her Christian sensibilities, regardless of its effect on public health. The whole point of not only democracy, but adulthood, is for people to educate themselves as much as possible on any and every given issue, so they can make an informed decision when the time comes. The mission of public schools and compulsory education is to do just that: create a responsible citizenry, so that it may govern itself.</p> <p>But the abstinence-only education approach hasn't produced pure young adults imbued with a responsible attitude toward sex and its implications. There is no positive correlation between abstinence-only education and a decrease in teen pregnancy, <a href=\"http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/117934920/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0\">according to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc</a> (pdf), which evaluated four abstinence only programmes over four to six years. As true limited-government conservatives would say: This is a waste of taxpayer money!</p> <p>There has, however, been a more ominous tread when sex has not been discussed frankly: widespread ignorance regarding other risky sexual acts that can also transmit disease. In April 2005, Yale and Columbia researchers looked into those teens that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48509-2005Mar18.html\">took an abstinence pledge</a> against those did that did not but chose to stay virgins. The pledges found loopholes, two to be exact. Boys that took the pledge not to engage in traditional intercourse were four times more likely to have had anal sex than non-pledges. All pledges were six times more likely to engage in oral sex than non-pledges were. They were also less likely to use a condom during there first sexual experience. Not surprisingly, these teens were also found to have the same rate of sexually transmitted diseases as their peers, but were less inclined to get tested for STDs.</p> <p>Studies such as these should lead schools to dismiss all abstinence-only programmes as ineffective. Why don't they? Because for some Christians, sex should only occur within the confines of marriage. If other kids can't control their genetic urges, so be it. As Michelle Goldberg wrote in her deft book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Coming-Rise-Christian-Nationalism/dp/0393060942\">Kingdom Coming</a>: \"One fundamental difference between sex ed and abstinence education, then, is whether the emphasis is on saving kids' bodies or saving their souls.\"</p> <p>This isn't just a battle between abstinence-only sex education and comprehensive sex education, but a battle between faith and reason, theocracy and democracy.</p> <p>This type of faith, of course, has been bludgeoning this country for the last eight years as the separation of church and state has been eroded with Bush's faith-based initiatives (which Democratic nominee Barack Obama erringly wants to extend under different rules); as the desert morality of archaic, nomadic tribes and an ignored messiah has been rolled out to justify opposition to the life-saving potential of stem-cell research and the teaching of evolution in public schools; and as the war on terrorism, especially in Iraq, has been considered divinely directed. Much like President Bush, Palin <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CVN_PALIN_IRAQ_WAR?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2008-09-03-22-48-15\">believes</a> the war in Iraq was \"a task from God\".</p> <p>It is a faith deeply hostile to democracy, which is the rule of the people, not the rule of a book written by an absent deity. It is a faith deeply hostile to the Enlightenment, which helped produce this republic and has shown that human reason and our innate morality allows humans to rule themselves without the help of the supernatural. It is a faith that says \"I demand that you live the way I do\" under the threat of exclusion, if not suppression.</p> <p>For far too long, Republicans and their evangelical base have harped on liberal elitism and its nanny state of social programmes, while liberals and secularists have allowed a much darker and ominous state to infiltrate our republic: a state governed by scripture without room for freedom of choice and conscience when it conflicts with its dictates.</p> <p>Do we really want another politician in the White House whose faith, rather than empirical evidence, determines her policies? Do we really want to put someone with another hotline to god in charge of our secular republic? Americans have suffered too long underneath this drift toward theocracy.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush will argue today that the withdrawal of 8,000 troops from Iraq is testament to the success of US strategy in Iraq, particularly his decision \u2014 in the face of widespread opposition \u2014 to launch last year's \"military surge\".</p> <p>The surge that began early last year has led to a big drop in sectarian violence, although Bob Woodward in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/05/usforeignpolicy.usa\">new book</a> cites other contributing factors: the decision by the Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to rein in his Mahdi army militias; the so-called Anbar Awakening, in which Sunni fighters allied themselves with US forces to fight against al-Qaida, and an assassination campaign against extremist leaders.</p> <p>But a reduction of 8,000 troops over the next few months will still leave US troop levels in Iraq at about 140,000, posing a big problem for Bush's successor. </p> <p>In fact, the pace of the reduction in combat troops is both slower and smaller than had been anticipated. US commanders see little alternative to keeping a big troop presence in Iraq for now because the situation remains fragile, although Baghdad has made it clear in current talks on a security pact that it would like all US combat forces to leave by 2011.</p> <p>Some strategists, notably Fred Kagan \u2014 one of the advocates of the surge \u2014 have argued that this is no time to ease military pressure on al-Qaida and the Shia militias. In a recent article <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.28324/pub_detail.asp\">Kagan wrote</a>: \"Now is exactly the time to continue the pressure to keep them from regaining their equilibrium. It need not, and probably will not, require large numbers of American casualties to keep this pressure on. But it will require a considerable number of American troops through 2009.\"</p> <p>He went on to argue that the US needed to maintain current levels through the Iraqi provincial elections later this year, and that consideration of force reductions made sense only after those elections and until the incoming commander in Iraq, General Ray Odierno, has assessed the new situation. </p> <p>Odierno is set to take over from General David Petraeus, who has been named to take over US central command, in charge of military operations in the Middle East, East Africa and Central Asia.</p> <p>Toby Dodge, an analyst at Queen Mary, University of London, said Bush's decision was a compromise between Petraeus and Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.</p> <p>He said: \"Petraeus wanted a slower withdrawal because he thinks the gains are reversible, while the other commanders wanted to shift troops to Afghanistan and to save the army from being broken, so Bush compromised between the two camps.\"</p> <p>Although the violence has dropped largely because of the surge, Dodge also believes the progress that has been achieved is clearly reversible. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi army is a work in progress and the police is still completely divided along sectarian lines.\"</p> <p>Kagan's pre-occupations are widely shared by US military commanders in Iraq, who are worried that violence may flare up during provincial elections \u2014 originally scheduled for this month but postponed after the failure of the Iraqi parliament to agree on a new electoral law. Iraq's parliament legislature must pass the law by the end of this month if elections are to take place this year. </p> <p>The law has been held up partly by disagreements among ethnic Kurds and other minorities about the unresolved status of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. There is also concern over Iranian-backed Shia militias. US officials fear that many of the militia leaders, who have fled after a government spring offensive in Baghdad and Basra, may be just biding their time.</p> <p>The success of the Sunnis in the Anbar awakening poses its own problems. Until now, these volunteers \u2014 about 100,000 \u2014 have been paid by the Americans. But the Shia-dominated government of Nouri al-Maliki, the prime minister, has said it would take over payment and find them jobs. But these Sunni volunteers view Maliki with suspicion, especially following the arrest of several Sunni leaders. For all these reasons, the next several months are seen as crucial and the potential for slippage from past security gains is very real.</p> <p>So Bush has had to be cautious about reducing the US troop presence in Iraq. But there had to be some give because American forces are so stretched. For the US military the drawdown in Iraq will mean little respite as Bush will be sending 4,500 extra troops to Afghanistan, where Nato is having a hard time with an emboldened Taliban, which is not only exacting a heavy toll on western forces, but stepping up suicide attacks in neighbouring Pakistan.</p> <p>In his speech, to be delivered at the US National Defence University, Bush devotes plenty of attention to Afghanistan, evidence of how badly Nato's war effort is faring in this front on the \"global war on terror\". In the past three months more American soldiers have died in Afghanistan than in Iraq.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan's success is critical to the security of America and our partners in the free world. And for all the good work we have done in that country, it is clear we must do even more,\" he says in the text of the speech released last night.</p> <p>Current US deployments to Afghanistan include 14,000 troops that are part of a Nato force and an additional 19,000 under separate US command. As Bush shuffles American troops around, one thing remains certain: American forces are fully stretched and are likely to remain so well into next year.</p>",
  "<p>There's a glorious history of civil disobedience in Britain, created by campaigners such as the suffragettes, who were prepared to break the law in the cause of justice, and this morning at Westminster another chapter was written \u2013 involving Lembit \u00d6pik and a <a href=\"http://www.segway.com/\">Segway</a>.</p> <p>I'm afraid I missed it. As a campaign stunt, \u00d6pik and three peers leapt on their Segways \u2013 the stand-up electric scooters made famous when <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2989000.stm\">George Bush fell off one</a> - outside the Houses of Parliament and rode them up to the Department of Transport along the public highway.</p> <p>Why was this an act of civil disobedience? Because you are only supposed to use them on private land and taking one on the road is apparently against the Road Traffic Act. \u00d6pik declared that he had <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7605353.stm\">\"decided to take a stand\" </a>and that he was \"challenging the government to either have us arrested or to accept that not doing so means the Segway PT (personal transporter) is effectively legal transport\".</p> <p>By the time I got there, it was over. Needless to say, \u00d6pik and his fellow Segway martyrs didn't get arrested. Instead, they just handed in a letter asking the government to pilot a scheme allowing the machines to be used on the roads.</p> <p>I was all set to take the mickey. After all, what with all that stuff about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gallery/2008/jul/14/lembitopik.liberaldemocrats?picture=335675020\">Cheeky Girls</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/15/lembitopik\">asteroid threat etc</a>, \u00d6pik is an easy target. But I notice that <a href=\"http://kerroncross.blogspot.com/2008/09/arrest-law-breaker-lembit-it-would-be.html\">someone else</a> has got there already and, on reflection, what's the point of liberals if they don't stand up for liberty.</p> <p>Besides, having had a chat with Murray Stewart, the Segway PR guy who was still hanging around outside Portcullis House after \u00d6pik et al had left, I could see that the Montgomeryshire MP had a point.</p> <p>Segways are green (they are battery-powered). There are only about 2,000 in the UK, but in most states in the US they are approved for use on the roads and there are around 400 police departments around the world that use them. Understandably, the manufacturers would like them licensed for road use here.</p> <p>Stewart even persuaded me to give one a go. They're unnerving \u2013 it's like a pogo stick on wheels - but I managed a few yards without doing a George Bush, which I suppose is some sort of achievement.</p> <p>Sadly, I'm not sure whether \u00d6pik's latest crusade will do him much good. He wants to be elected as the Lib Dems' next party president. But today Lib Dem Voice has published <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/ldv-members-survey-2-who-you-would-elect-party-president-3613.html\">a poll of members</a> showing him trailing badly behind Ros Scott, a Lib Dem peer.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMZw4dYnLxr5AKkDn0bKGqH0epYAD930EBDG0\">Jack Abramoff cried in court</a> on Thursday when he was sentenced to four more years in prison. The former Republican lobbyist is already serving a six-year sentence for fraud in Florida. Now, however, in federal court, he's been convicted on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy and tax evasion. Honestly, those terms sound a little nice for what Abramoff did, which he at one time claimed was standard practice in Washington. Basically, he engaged in some old-fashioned bribery, offering lawmakers expensive trips and gifts in exchange for favours on Capitol Hill. </p> <p>Now that he's been proven guilty, his life is over and his name is ruined. Or so he said in court, apparently in the hopes of making the judge feel sorry for him. But on the bright side, he will soon release a book about how he became the \"fall guy\" for corrupt politicians. Actually, the book, <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2066350/posts\">The Perfect Villain: John McCain and the Demonisation of Jack Abramoff</a>, was written by Gary Chafetz with Abramoff's cooperation, but the point remains the same.</p> <p>Lets not forget that Paris Hilton was a \"Paris Who?\" until that infamous video got loose. So, what did she do next? She wrote a book, of course! And check out Lynne Spears <a href=\"http://celebrities.gearlive.com/vip/article/q108-lynne-spears-book-sure-to-create-a-storm/\">cashing in</a> on her daughters' myriad problems, from teen pregnancies to failed marriages with a hefty side of drug abuse. Now that's good reading material, right? </p> <p>Meanwhile, Britney Spears <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/arts/television/08mtv.html?ref=arts\">got another shot</a> at opening the MTV Music Video Awards this past weekend because, in the celebrity world, it pays to be a drama queen. But in politics? Not so much.</p> <p>It's only right that some images are beyond repair. OJ Simpson, for example, cannot get away with a <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/books/08/14/simpsonbook.ap/index.html\">book about his hypothetical method of murdering his ex-wife</a>. No, Mr Simpson, we do not want to know how you would've done it, nor are we interested in how unfairly you've been treated. Playing the victim will not gain you our sympathy.</p> <p>And the same goes for Abramoff. The Perfect Villain casts Abramoff as a victim and a scapegoat, and even implicates John McCain in the title. To be a grammar geek for a moment, just look at the name placement in that title. It sure looks like it's all about McCain, and that Abramoff is just an innocent bystander. Interestingly, the book's release later this month seems aimed to impact the November election, although it probably won't sway many voters.</p> <p>The book's basic argument is that poor Jack Abramoff got caught up in a culture of corruption in Washington and was only following suit when he got caught, chewed up and spit out by the same people who taught him the game. It's not too different from memoirs about kids who learned to snort coke riding in the back of their Mickey Mouse Club tour bus. Oh poor them, right? They didn't know any better. Except, in this case, Abramoff did \u2013 or he should have.</p> <p>Entertainers of all stripes can write flimsy books about their dramatic childhoods, their drug experiments and their sexual escapades, and at least some of us will still love them. Lindsay Lohan can be arrested and sent to rehab repeatedly, but when she hits the magazine covers, they still sell, even if no one is sure why she's still famous. And Paris Hilton did that <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/64ad536a6d\">celebrity-president campaign ad</a>, which was funny no matter how flaky you think she is. </p> <p>When Abramoff was sentenced last week, he had some touching things to say about his regrets, and he looked pathetic enough, but in a country that prides itself on having a stable and well-thought-out system of government, doing all the footwork to corrupt that system isn't the kind of thing that can be easily forgiven. We don't fool ourselves into thinking our government is perfect. Lies and scandals have been popping like fireworks all year long. But Americans are still idealists, and though it's not cool to say it, we generally love our country. If we didn't, we wouldn't be so sickened by guys like Abramoff.</p> <p>Years from now, or maybe in just a few months, political scientists and historians may write books on corruption in the US government in the early 21st century, and Abramoff may be in there somewhere. But meanwhile, I don't expect many readers to attend his pity party.</p>",
  "<p>Another void has been located in London's public transport arithmetic. The Guardian's Dan Milmo <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/09/london.london\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The London underground network is facing a funding gap of more than \u00a33bn as the cost of repairing the tube system spirals out of control. An assessment of the tube network's financial needs published this morning outlined a financial black hole of up to \u00a31.4bn on a third of the capital's underground lines. The latest figures create a severe financial headache for the government when they are added to the projected \u00a32bn funding gap on the rest of the tube system.</p> </blockquote> <p>TfL is blaming the government and asking it to step in. The Assembly's Lib Dems are pinning the problem on Gordon too. Their transport spokesperson is <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/members/pidgeonc.jsp\">Caroline Pidgeon AM</a>. In a statement she says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"He was the Chancellor of the Exchequer who pushed through the ill-fated PPP project for London's Underground and that project has now cost London's hard pressed traveling public billions of pounds. Gordon Brown assured Londoners the PPP method of funding the tube was the only way in which upgrades and refurbishments could be provided. And yet we're still waiting for them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I wonder what Labour has to say.</p>",

  "<p>Maqbool Fida Husain, India's most famous living artist, will not be able to return to India unless the hundreds of cases claiming he hurt \"Hindu sentiment\" are withdrawn, say experts despite a ruling from the country's supreme court clearing him of the charges.<br> The artist has been in self-imposed exile since January 2006, forced out by threats from Hindu groups enraged by his paintings of nude gods and goddesses. On Monday three supreme court judges considered whether his painting, Bharat Mata (Mother India), which depicts a nude woman on her knees creating the shape of a map of India, was sacrilegious. The bench rejected the petition seeking prosecution for offending Hindus, saying it was a work of art and citing India's tradition of graphic sexual iconography. \"Does the sentiment of the petitioner get scandalized by the large number of photographs of erotic sculptures which are in circulation?\" the judges asked. \"It is an art like the sculptures. None get scandalized looking at the sculptures.\" The artist, known in India as MF Husain, told the Associated Press: \"At last, the dignity of Indian contemporary art has been upheld by the supreme court as expected.\" He could not be contacted today. MF Husain put Indian modern art on the world map. By 2005 he was the highest paid painter in India with his work easily fetching $1m (\u00a3538,000). However claims that he would be able to return home to India were in doubt. Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.India\">MF Husain told the Guardian</a> there were \"3,000 legal cases which have been lodged against me in the past eight years\".<br> Organisations that have long defended the painter said that rightwing Hindu groups could still keep \"hounding Husain\". \"We welcome the court judgment,\" said Rajan Prasad of Sahmat, which last month put on an exhibition of Husain's work that was vandalised by Hindu activists.  \"The problem is that this petition relates to just five cases quashed by the high court. The other cases stand. Even if you quash all the cases these guys can simply lodge more. Unless the executive takes a decision and changes the law to defend freedom of expression [MF Husain] will be in exile for years to come.\"</p>",

But, after a \u00a310m investigation and trial lasting more than two years, the jury could not agree on the main allegation - that eight men planned to blow up seven airliners on their way to North America from Heathrow.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service today said it had yet to decide whether to request a retrial and was involving police in its deliberations. It has until the end of the month to make a decision.</p> <p>What is clear, however, is that more evidence might have been gathered had Rashid Rauf, a man believed to have been a key figure in the alleged plot, not been arrested in Pakistan.</p> <p>His arrest on August 9 2006 came as a surprise to British police and intelligence officers involved in the surveillance of the alleged plotters in the UK. It is understood that Rauf was arrested at the request of US authorities, who wanted to strike as soon as they heard about the alleged plot.</p> <p>Rauf's arrest was unwelcome in London. The US action triggered arrests in Britain that were forced on the security and intelligence agencies sooner than they expected, or wanted.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4710870.ece\">Writing in today's Times</a>, Peter Clarke, who retired as head of counter-terrorism command in 2008 and led the liquid bomb plot inquiry, said Rauf's arrest was \"not good news\" as officers were at a \"critical point\" in building a case against the plotters.</p> <p>He wrote that Scotland Yard decided in \"a matter of minutes\" that all 20 suspects had to be arrested to prevent them destroying evidence and fleeing or mounting \"a desperate attack\".</p> <p>Professor Michael Clarke, the director of the Royal United Services Institute, said that there was a \"different approach\" between counter-terrorism in the UK and the US, with the former focusing on establishing the strongest criminal case possible.</p> <p>\"For the British, the evidence will never be better than the night before the plot is sprung. For the Americans, when you see a plot you break it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p> <p>He added that he was \"pretty sure\" that the US president, George Bush, discussed the matter with the then prime minister, Tony Blair. That may lend weight to the theory that Bush put pressure on the UK intelligence agencies to act swiftly.</p> <p>Officials familiar with the investigation made this clear to the Guardian today. They said that since the investigation was an international one, \"the situation was not entirely under our control\".</p> <p>They added that there was always a balance to be struck between intelligence officers wanting to pursue a surveillance operation and the overriding responsibility of the police to protect the public.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the whereabouts of Rauf are unknown. In December 2007, he escaped from police guards in Pakistan by slipping out of the back door of a mosque he had been allowed to pray in.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Atlanta, Georgia.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Matt Lambert (guitar, vocals), Jim Crook (drums), Titus Brown (bass, vocals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> All the Saints are a three-piece from Atlanta who have been described as a metal Radiohead or the missing link between space-rock and grunge, between Spiritualized and Soundgarden. Actually, they sound to our ears more like Wish You Were Here-era Pink Floyd with Owen Morris at the controls, or Swervedriver, that early-90s Creation band who attempted, via dream-pop, to capture the widescreen, epic feel of a US rock band. Most of all they sound like Oasis if they'd been shoegazers. That's not as preposterous as it might first sound. You could tell, as soon as you heard Oasis' debut album Definitely Maybe and its immense wall of guitars, that Noel Gallagher had been listening to Creation label mates My Bloody Valentine. And you can tell that this Atlanta three-piece have been listening to both Oasis and the Valentines. It's got feedback, fuzz and an enormous droning intensity that is both anthemic and psychedelic. <br> Despite the fact that their voices are treated and enhanced by a series of effects that makes them sound like they're singing from the wrong side of a wind tunnel, Lambert and Brown have the insouciant arrogance of the Gallagher brothers. There are even two tracks on All the Saints' debut album Fire on Corridor X called Sheffield and Leeds, and although they're named after cities in their home state of Alabama (they only recently relocated to Georgia), it's tempting to see them as paeans to the UK's other northern rock centres after Manchester (especially the goth stronghold that is Leeds, because there is a Mission-ary urgency to All the Saints' attack). Turns out we're not being too fanciful \u2013 ALS were turned on to haze-rock exponents like MBV, Ride and the Jesus and Mary Chain by an elder sister of one of the band, who used to tape a local Anglophile indie radio station in the early 90s.  It's dark, driving drone-rock that sounds like it was made by young men not far from the depraved edge \u2013 and yet two of its creators, Lambert and Brown, were raised as strict Christians in the heart of the Bible Belt. That's the first surprise about Fire on Corridor X. The second is that it was produced at their local studio Nickel &amp; Dime by Ben H Allen, most recently acclaimed for his work with Gnarls Barkley. There is no funk or hip-hop element to All the Saints' music but Allen has managed to give tracks like Sheffield and Hornett a cosmic, rhythmic groove-power that will cause the sort of violent head-nodding not seen since the heyday of Loop and Spacemen 3. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Imagine if Radiohead were a hard-rock band with a more metal edge, or if Syd Barrett made a hard-rock record.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> This is what we imagined Kasabian's Empire was going to sound like. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Cause a sonic boom. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Cause Jason Pierce to get back in touch with Sonic Boom.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Fire on Corridor X is released by Touch &amp; Go on November 17.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Swervedriver, Oasis, Spacemen 3, Loop. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/allthesaints\">www.myspace.com/allthesaints</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Petit Mal. </p>",
  "<p>It was Kenard, in the Korean store, with the handgun. That's who killed Omar Little. From the moment you saw him on the beach in Mexico, comfortable in a straw hat, the odds of the man completing one final, conclusive rip'n'run back in Baltimore were going to be long. But to die halfway through making an order (\"Let me get one of those...\" being his final words) seems a cruel way for anyone to go.</p> <p>The news of Omar's passing travels slowly. Bunk is quickly on the scene, communing one last time with the one mope with whom, over the course of these five seasons, he had built an understanding. But Chris and Snoop, for once, are in the dark, dreaming up new plans to catch their foe while he's already on a slab. At the Sun, Gus spikes a possible story (death by shooting of a 34-year-old male) in favour of a few paragraphs on a house fire. McNutty, meanwhile, is more interested in Bunk's other news \u2013 a warrant for the arrest of Chris Partlow \u2013 and how it might affect Lester's wire. Only a morgue attendant, who spots the wrong tag on his body bag, shows Omar the respect he deserves. </p> <p>Kenard will continue no doubt; the pre-teen kingpin will prevail. Spiteful, vindictive and, as we see in episode eight (entitled Two Down), self-confident. Omar barely registers the child's presence in the bullet-proofed store, but in a second he is on the floor, the victim of one clean shot to the head. Kenard stands over him, scared by what, you want to assume, is his first murder. Another second ticks by and he regains his composure, threatening to kill the screaming shop attendant too.</p> <p>What does it mean for the Wire that Omar, the closest thing the show had to a marketable commodity (my brother does have the T-shirt), is killed in this way? Nothing, probably. We didn't need to be told that violence can happen randomly in this programme, nor that characters don't always get their just desserts. That said, antagonising a city's drug dealers while squatting right in the heart of the projects with a penchant for going to the shops sporting only a dressing gown and matching shotgun might be said to be a habit that would attract trouble in the end. Omar, you will be missed.</p> <p>At this rate, so will Jimmy McNulty. Ten minutes after the death of Omar, McNutty and Keema are in Quantico to meet the Feds in what proves to be the funniest scene of the season. There to receive a psychological profile on the Baltimore homeless killer, McNutty is forced to try to keep his face straight and his eyes narrow as the profilers read out a detailed description that bears a frightening resemblance to a certain murder police.</p> <p>\"Someone without a college education who nonetheless feels himself superior to those with advanced education ... Someone who works within a bureaucratic service or quasi-public service from which he feels alienated ... Possibly a high-functioning alcoholic ...\" The list goes on. At least McNutty will be less inclined to dismiss such practices in future.</p> <p>At the same time as he's wasting the Feds' time, McNutty is also seeing his patronage in OT and pool cars the subject of threats from colleagues searching for a jolly. The warrant for Partlow's arrest means that a legitimate investigation could undermine his own duplicitous one. And finally, yet most importantly, he's had to tell Keema quite what the scam is and she's unwilling to take part. Will McNutty receive the wrong toe-tag when he's carried out of the service on a stretcher?</p> <p>\u00b7 Read Steve Busfield's blog on the episode <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/09/the_wire_season_five_episode_e.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Vodafone's new chief executive, Vittorio Colao, has made his first significant move since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/28/vodafonegroup.telecoms1\">taking control of the mobile giant this summer</a>, reorganising its assets outside western Europe in a shake-up that sees the departure of emerging markets boss Paul Donovan. </p> <p>From January, the group will split its central Europe, Middle East, Asia Pacific and affiliates (Emapa) division into two parts, one focusing on central Europe and Africa, the other on Asia.</p> <p>The move, announced today, reflects the increasing importance of these fast-growing markets, which now account for about 25% of the group's revenues.</p> <p>In Africa, for instance, it recently completed the acquisition of a 70% stake in Ghana's third-largest mobile phone company and is believed to be negotiating to increase its stake in South African joint venture Vodacom.</p> <p>Among other recent investments, the company has also taken a 3% stake in China Mobile and has a 67% stake in its Indian venture. </p> <p>Donovan, who has been with the company since 1999 and run Emapa since its creation in May 2006, made the decision to leave, said Vodafone. He will stay with the company until the end of the year.</p> <p>\"I want to extend my thanks and appreciation for all that Paul has done for our business and in particular his role in expanding our emerging markets portfolio,\" said Colao. </p> <p>Donovan was recently linked with the vacant chief executive's job at Arsenal football club, although it is understood he has no immediate job to go to.</p> <p>He was seen as a potential internal rival to Colao to succeed Arun Sarin, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/10/vodafonegroup.telecoms\">left in July after five years as chief executive</a>. </p> <p>As part of the restructuring, Vodafone is splitting off its investment in US group Verizon Wireless, which until now has been housed in the Emapa division.</p> <p>It will now be managed directly by Colao, finance director Andy Halford and Terry Kramer, who has been promoted from human resources director to the new post of group strategy and business improvement director.</p> <p>Vodafone said it had recruited Michel Combes, the head of French multimedia group TDF, to take Colao's old job running the European business, which covers 10 countries, including the major markets of the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. </p> <p>Vodafone is to conduct an internal and external search for chief executives to run its two new divisions.

  "<p>When Vietnamese monk <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c\">Thich Quang Duc</a> set fire to himself at a busy intersection in Saigon in 1963, few of the Afghan women who later followed his example were even born. Most of them had probably never heard of the burning Buddhist monk, of the way pictures of his spectacular protest made the then US president, John F Kennedy, famously shriek \"Jesus Christ!\", or of the way, as some say, his self-immolation speeded up the downfall of the regime against which the monk was protesting. </p> <p>His death triggered many questions and interpretations. In the words of one commentator at the time: \"To set oneself on fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance.\" Thinking of the Afghan women who set light to themselves, just what is this thing of utmost importance that they are trying to say? Since March 2008, there have been a hundred cases of self-immolation in southwestern Afghanistan alone; 100 women who got hold of fuel, soaked themselves in the liquid and lit the match to stage a small-scale domestic revolution of a spectacular nature. If they wanted to say something, they wanted to say it with vehemence. If they wanted to leave this world, they didn't want to leave quietly. But what is their motivation? And who or what is the subject of their protest?</p> <p>Unlike the burning monk, who wrote down all his hopes, wishes and complaints prior to his death, little is known about what motivates the Afghan women. Few of them survive to tell the tale and those who do survive are unwilling to talk. Afghan documentary film maker Olga Sadat spent months at a hospital which specialises in treating burns. She waited patiently but persistently to win the trust of the women she interviewed for her film Yak, Do, Seh (One, Two, Three). The film is a documentary cautionary tale the aim of which is to discourage self-immolation. In an interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle international radio, Sadat said, </p> <blockquote> <p>Unfortunately, in the eight months that I was working on the film, only one of the many women who had set themselves on fire and were brought to the hospital managed to survive. But even that woman is in a bad state.</p> </blockquote> <p>The woman had set fire to herself in protest against maltreatment on the part of her husband. </p> <p>Sadat told Deutsche Welle that she believes that the women who set themselves on fire are confident that someone will come to their rescue while they are in the process of catching fire. Those she did manage to interview for her film said that when they lit the match, their aim was not suicide. They just wanted the people who maltreated them to take notice of the suffering they had caused. </p> <p>Forced marriages and maltreatment by husbands and fathers is often cited as the cause of the despair that leads women to use household fuel to set fire to themselves. But a closer look reveals a more complex picture. </p> <p>Sometimes the protest is directed against other women, such as an unkind mother-in-law. Other times girls have set fire to themselves for the love of a man they could not marry. And then there's protest against institutions, like case of the woman in <a href=\"http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/2008/01/30/young-afghan-woman-tries-self-immolation.html\">Laghman</a>, northern Afghanistan, who came to the court hiding petrol under her burqa. She had petitioned for divorce and was awaiting the verdict when she set fire to herself. </p> <p>Female drug addiction is an equally powerful trigger that has led to self-immolation in places like Ghore, in western Afghanistan. But the fact remains that the women themselves are usually silent on the meaning of their own suicides and the meaning of their acts remains essentially ambiguous. </p> <p>In a recent statement, the Afghan women's affairs minister said: </p> <blockquote> <p>As long as all individuals, but especially the families, fail to ensure women's social and human rights, it's impossible for the government or the related offices to have any notable success in reducing violence against women.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other officials, like Sima Shir Mohammadi, the head of the women's affairs department in Herat, blame the war. They say violence stops government offices and aid agencies from reaching remote areas. That's why cases of self-immolation have fallen in the cities but increased in rural areas.</p> <p>Earlier, in an <a href=\"http://www.femschool.com/spip.php?article1094\">interview</a> with an Iranian feminist website, Shir Mohammadi said her department had worked hard to tackle the problem: \"We had meetings with religious scholars and asked them to make use of religious texts, Qur'anic verses and the prophet's sayings in their Friday sermons and in radio and television speeches to tell the people in rural areas that suicide is not the solution.\" The clerics also tell worshippers that maltreatment of girls and women is not allowed in Islam. Both Shir Mohammadi and the women's affairs minister believe that the cooperation of religious scholars is essential in solving this problem. This society is traditional and the people respect the clerics and follow their advice. </p> <p>Time will tell whether the preachers' message will prove effective and discourage women from resorting to fuel and matches to get their message across. What's certain is that the traditional path of \"patience and forbearance\" has lost its appeal to Afghan women.</p>",
  "<p>Russia said today its troops would stay in the breakaway Georgian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia for a long time to come, a day after Moscow agreed to pull its forces out of other Georgian territory within the month. </p> <p>Yesterday's deal, between France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, specifically excluded Abkhazia and South Ossetia. </p> <p>The future of the two enclaves, which Moscow recognised as independent last month, will be discussed at an international conference in Geneva on October 15. </p> <p>But Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said Russia's military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was necessary in order to avert Georgian attempts to regain control. </p> <p>He said troops would remain for the foreseeable future, though he did not indicate how many soldiers would be based in the area. Russia would sign formal agreements with both regions on the extent of the military presence. </p> <p>Lavrov's comments will heighten tensions with Georgia, which regards South Ossetia and Abkhazia as inseparable parts of the country. </p> <p>In a cautious welcome to yesterday's deal, Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, reiterated his country's claim to the regions. The Russians, he said, \"should get the hell out of the territories they control\". </p> <p>Describing the deal as \"momentous\", Sarkozy said Moscow had agreed to scrap its checkpoints inside Georgia within a week and had promised to remove all forces from areas adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia within a month. </p> <p>The agreement also envisaged the deployment of a 200-strong force of EU observers to Georgia by October 1, Sarkozy said. </p> <p>Sarkozy, the current EU president, led yesterday's negotiations, together with the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana. </p> <p>The deal appears to mark a major achievement for Sarkozy. He was criticised widely after Moscow failed to implement his previous, August 12 ceasefire agreement, which called on Russia to pull its troops out. </p> <p>\"All has not been resolved,\" Sarkozy said. \"We are aware of that. But what has been resolved has been considerable.\" Welcoming the deal, he added that both the EU and Russia had avoided \"a cold war that we don't need\". </p> <p>In a press conference yesterday afternoon, after four hours of talks, Medvedev made clear that Russia's withdrawal of forces depended on Georgia's signing a \"non-aggression pact\" with South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Medvedev said Russia would continue to provide \"military assistance\" to the breakaway provinces. </p> <p>However, in a sign of continuing tension with Russia, the US administration said it was cancelling a much-heralded civilian nuclear cooperation deal with Russia, which the US president, George Bush, sent to Congress for approval in May after two years of tough negotiations. </p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said in a statement yesterday: \"We make this decision with regret. Unfortunately, given the current environment, the time is not right for this agreement.\" </p> <p>Earlier, in Moscow, Medvedev bitterly criticised the US, which he said had encouraged Georgia's \"aggression\" against South Ossetia, as well as its attack on August 8. The US was also \"actively\" rearming Georgia, he claimed, adding that Russia would no longer accept a \"unipolar model\" of world affairs in which the US decided \"the rules of the game\". </p> <p>Asked whether the Kremlin planned to invade any more of its neighbours, Medvedev looked irritated. Referring to Georgia, he said: \"This is an individual situation. Everything else is just plots ... Some people are trying to look at Russia like the Soviet Union. Russia is different. But Russia needs to be taken into account.\" </p> <p>Assuming Russia fully withdraws its forces, talks could resume in October on an EU-Russia cooperation deal, Sarkozy said. EU countries suspended the talks last week in protest at Russia's actions in Georgia. </p> <p>According to Russia's Kommersant newspaper, Moscow plans to establish diplomatic relations with Abkhazia and South Ossetia today.</p>",

This time no one is holding their breath.</p> <p>The deal the French and EU president struck with the Russian leader, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7603355.stm\">Dmitry Medvedev</a>, is at least a little tighter than its August 12 precursor, which had loopholes big enough to drive a tank through \u2013 or several armoured columns as it turned out \u2013 under the guise of the \"additional security measures\" Moscow was entitled to take.</p> <p>Those measures have provided cover for Russian forces to entrench themselves deep inside Georgia well beyond the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia that they were ostensibly there to protect. </p> <p>Despite repeated pledges from President Medvedev that they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/09/russia.georgia\">would pull out</a>, they remain dug in around the strategic port of Poti and the western hub of Senaki, raising questions over how much control the new man in the Kremlin wields over Russia's armed forces. </p> <p>Under the new Sarkozy deal, the <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/09/09/europe/09georgia.php\">Russians will withdraw</a> from those positions in \"Georgia proper\" by October 11, once 200 EU monitors arrive to take over their positions. Four days later, there will be international talks on Georgia's future in Geneva.</p> <p>It sounds plausible, but there is plenty of room for scepticism. Firstly, there are other conditions on the Russian withdrawal which could provide ample wiggle room if Moscow wants to make use, of it.</p> <p>There is, for example, the stipulation that Georgian forces return to their bases. The catch is \u2013 for many of them, there are no bases to return to. They have razed by Russians. Any attempt to regroup at their charred remains would mean crossing Russian checkpoints. </p> <p>Secondly, the pullback from Poti and Senaki would require Georgia to pledge not to use military force in nearby Abkhazia. Tbilisi, however, is unlikely to sign anything that appears to confer legitimacy on Abkhazia's secession, and would probably call for Russia to give similar undertakings.</p> <p>As for the Geneva peace talks, there is the question of what there is to talk about. Moscow <a href=\" http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/26/content_9716666.htm\">has recognised</a> Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence, an irrevocable step that precludes any compromise solution on status. </p> <p>It is entirely unlikely that Moscow or the authorities it backs in the two regions will allow the return of the 250,000 Georgians driven out of Abkhazia in the early 1990s or of tens of thousands forced to leave South Ossetia after last month's conflicts.</p> <p>This critical stumbling block illustrates the essential difference between the partition of Georgia and the Kosovo declaration of independence earlier this year, which Russia points to as a precedent.</p> <p>Kosovo's breakaway reversed the results of Serbian ethnic cleansing. The secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is intended to set the consequences of ethnic cleansing in stone. </p> <p>Nato troops in Kosovo have spent the past nine years protecting the Serb minority. Russian troops in Georgia have done nothing to impede the victimisation of the Georgians in the breakaway regions, to put it mildly.</p> <p>It is hard to see what Geneva can achieve, and it is equally difficult to imagine what the EU can do if Russia does not withdraw from Georgia after all. Britain's attempt to use the crisis to crystallise some sort of united European bargaining position on Russian gas supplies has gone nowhere. The national interests at stake are too immediate and too visceral. No European government is willing to risk its voters going cold this winter because of withheld supplies.</p> <p>When Russian diplomats talk about the future of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, they either mention the precedent of Kosovo (recognised by some nations and not by others) or they talk about northern Cyprus (recognised only by Turkey). Turkey's recognition has done it no harm in the long term, they point out. For Moscow, another two frozen conflicts is a quite acceptable outcome.</p>",
  "<p>The Sri Lankan air force shot down a Tamil Tiger aircraft for the first time during an attack by the rebels on a military base, said the government, in a bloody clash which left more than 20 people dead.<br> The attack took place in the early hours of the morning and saw the rebels target the army's military headquarters for the northern region in Vavuniya. Two aircraft attacked the base along with rebel fighters. According to the defence ministry, 10 soldiers and 10 rebels were killed in ground battles at the camp. A policeman was also died in the pre-dawn raid, which appears to have been repelled. </p> <p>The fighting is the latest indication that the war is entering a deadlier phase. On Monday Sri Lanka's government announced a ban on foreign aid workers and many of their local colleagues working in Tamil-rebel held areas in the north.</p> <p>There can be no independent verification of the casualties as the army does not allow journalists inside the theatre of \"operations\".<br> \"Terrorists launched a pre-dawn ground assault with artillery fire and an air raid with the intention of causing severe damage to air force assets,'' the defence ministry said in a statement on its website. The ministry also said it destroyed an aircraft from the air wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Five Czech-built propeller aircraft are believed to have been smuggled into Sri Lanka in parts and re-assembled.  The appearance of the world's first rebel air force had been a significant propaganda victory for the Tigers. Last month, according to the TamilNet website, rebel planes carried out a successful raid on the headquarters of the navy in the eastern port of Trincomalee. There is little doubt that Sri Lanka's army has pushed the Tamil Tigers deep back toward their headquarters in Kilinochchi. Last week the two sides clashed over control of a key rebel position. The army said more than 70 rebels were killed while the LTTE said a similar number of soldiers died. Despite claims by the military, it is clear that Tigers remain a potent fighting force. Last December Sri Lanka's army chief, Sarath Fonseka, said the military would \"wipe out\" the LTTE by June this year.  By its own count, the Sri Lankan army has killed an estimated 9,000 LTTE fighters for the loss of 1,700 soldiers since August 2006. However, the army admits that, in the \"worst case scenario\", there remain 5,000 fighters in the Tiger stripes thanks largely to \"underage conscription\". The rebel's iconic leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, remains at large. The Tigers' ultimate aim is to carve a separate state in the north and the east of the island, a homeland for the country's 3 million Tamils. But analysts say the rebels are on the back foot and need a \"spectacular\" to regain the offensive. \"Until recently the fighting had not begun in earnest. But it's clear that LTTE does not have a vast reservoir of manpower,\" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a Colombo-based thinktank. \" \"Unless they can can strike back with a big act of terrorism, the army can keep chipping away\u2026 however the government could still pull a political defeat from the jaws of a military victory because the underlying causes of conflict have not been resolved.\"</p>",

  "<p><br>Bloody hell ... Michael C Hall in CBS's Dexter</p> <p>\"Show, don't tell\" is a rule for writers to live by, but it might be time to add a caveat for today's TV scribes: maybe don't show quite so much.</p> <p>Since the success of Sex and the City and The Sopranos, we have been seeing a lot more of everything. The first shows to bring cable company HBO to worldwide attention, they broke the mould in terms of what we expected to see on TV. Because cable companies are not bound by the restrictions that networks like ABC and NBC have to abide by, they can be as rule-breaking in their programme-making as they wish.</p> <p>So writers and producers became more adventurous, showing us everything from the gory details of plastic surgery (in FX's Nip/Tuck) to the sex lives of polygamous Mormons (in HBO's Big Love). Cable companies now lead the way in producing cult TV, with shows like Weeds, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2008/07/the_wire_too_black_too_strong.html\">The Wire</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2007/10/tv_drama_round_up_1.html\">Californication</a> and <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/tv/2008/02/dexter_not_like_the_fraggles.html\">Dexter</a> being prime examples of programmes with cachet.</p> <p>But while this is often touted as a good thing, I'm not sure it really is. Although they all have great production values and occasionally feature a likeable character, they are for the most part low on charm and lacking in subtlety.</p> <p>I'd much rather watch ABC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/nov/14/broadcasting.usnews\">Desperate Housewives</a> than Weeds (made by HBO rival Showtime). Both attempt to subvert the suburban experience but, lacking the constraints imposed by a network, Weeds always takes things too far. Of course, a show about a widow-turned-drug dealer was never going to be subtle, but what an exciting prospect it could have been if the writers had aimed for understated instead of over-the-top. In one episode I watched, a man and a woman were talking, then abruptly engaged in energetic sex on a kitchen counter. For no reason.</p> <p>And this is now the standard: sex instead of storylines, violence instead of character growth. Where the sex, swearing and violence in the Sopranos were relevant to the plot, and sometimes surprising in their restraint, now it seems a cable TV show can't survive without copious helpings of all three.</p> <p>Although I was as frustrated as anyone else when the rudest thing Housewives' Bree could say to her lying husband was that she was going to \"French\" another man (I'm still not sure if snogging or a language lesson was on the agenda), I'd rather see self-control than a swear-filled slanging match: one creates tension, the other a tension headache.</p> <p>But it seems anyone making a show for HBO and co these days thinks they won't succeed without further challenging the boundaries of good taste; that they have to push the envelope, whether it benefits their programme or not. In fact, there could be nothing more cutting-edge right now than a cable TV show that was well-written and well-acted, in which the story was more important than the sensationalism. I live in hope.</p>",
  "<p>When Britain's prime minister, Gordon Brown, visited Ramallah in mid-July, he <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,386785,00.html\">told</a> the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas: \"We want to see a freeze on settlements. Settlement expansion has made peace harder to achieve. It erodes trust, it heightens Palestinian suffering, it makes the compromises Israel needs to make for peace more difficult.\"</p> <p>In that case, the decision by the British government to <a href=\"http://www.ibcc.co.il/news.htm#9\">rent space</a> for our new embassy in Tel Aviv from the Africa-Israel Investments company chaired by businessman <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Leviev\">Lev Leviev</a> sends precisely the wrong message.</p> <p>Leviev, a Russian-Israeli real estate and diamond billionaire who recently became a UK resident, is also a major settlement builder. Danya Cebus, a subsidiary of Leviev's Africa-Israel group, has built homes in three West Bank settlements - Mattityahu East, Har Homa, and <a href=\"http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9235.shtml\">Ma'ale Adumim</a>. </p> <p>Additionally, Leviev is a <a href=\"http://adalahny.org/index.php/boycott-against-land-developers-leviev?start=3\">major donor</a> to the Land Redemption Fund (LRF), which is affiliated with the radical fundamentalist <a href=\"http://www.cactus48.com/fundamentalism.html\">Gush Emunim</a> settler movement. The LRF uses highly questionable methods to secure Palestinian land for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, in clear violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva convention.</p> <p>The settlement of Mattityahu East along with Israel's wall, which was built mostly inside the occupied West Bank to grab land for settlements, seizes 50% of the village of Bil'in's land, including olive groves that its residents have relied on for centuries. Leviev's Zufim settlement, again along with Israel's Wall, seizes as much as two-thirds of the village of Jayyous' agricultural land and six wells, effectively annexing one of the West Bank's most fertile agricultural zones. Since 2002, residents of Bil'in and Jayyous have held more than 250 <a href=\"|http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2003-08-17-omar_x.htm\">nonviolent protests</a>, with the support of Israeli and international activists, in an effort to save their lands.</p> <p>The Israeli army <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1018282.html\">meets the protesters</a> with clubs, teargas, bullets, curfews, arrests and stink sprays.</p> <p>The settlements where Leviev's companies have recently built homes trap Palestinians in disconnected enclaves, destroying the possibility of creating a viable Palestinian state. The settlements of Ma'ale Adumim and Har Homa constitute part of an outer ring of settlements that cut off East Jerusalem from the occupied West Bank, and separate its north from its south.</p> <p>Israel's facts on the ground, created by companies like Leviev's, make the two-state solution impossible, resulting in a <em>de facto</em> one-state solution, in which half the population lives under apartheid-like conditions \u2013 contradicting Israel's proclaimed democracy. Having raised this issue in petitions and pressure on Israel's architects and construction industry, <a href=\"http://apjp.org/\">Architects and Planners for Justice in Palestine</a> has protested at Leviev's Bond Street jewelry boutique, in conjunction with <a href=\"http://adalahny.org/\">Adalah-NY</a>, which has also carried out a series of protests at Leviev's Madison Avenue store in New York. These actions respond to a call for a boycott of Leviev's companies issued by the villages of Jayyous and Bil'in - a call that has also been taken up by US and Israel-based peace groups and the Palestinian Boycott National Committee, which represents 171 Palestinian civil society organisations.</p> <p>Yet the British government seems to be immune to taking positive action. In late June, after three Israeli settler leaders were invited to the Tel Aviv home of the UK ambassador, Tom Phillips, for the Queen's birthday, Crispin Blunt MP sent a blistering <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215331200556&amp;pagename=JPArticle%2FshowFull\">protest letter</a> to Foreign Office minister Kim Howells. \"Entertaining the pioneers of this colonisation movement has certainly given the strong impression that Britain tacitly endorses it or no longer objects to it,\" demonstrating a \"weakening in the government's long-held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace\".</p> <p>Blunt demanded that British taxpayers' money should not be \"spent entertaining those who violate the Fourth Geneva Conventions and whose very presence has been an obstacle to a vital and much needed peace deal in the Middle East\". Kim Howells responded that the settlers' presence \"was not helpful\" and that they would not receive such invitations again.</p> <p>Rewarding Leviev with the contract for our new embassy shows that Her Majesty's government is not serious about stopping Israeli settlements. Rather than mouthing admirable but empty platitudes about freezing settlements, for the sake of all Israelis and Palestinians, let us apply serious sanctions to stop Israel expanding illegal settlements and the Wall, and take our business elsewhere.</p>",
  "<p>The London underground network is facing a funding gap of more than \u00a33bn as the cost of repairing the tube system spirals out of control.</p> <p>An assessment of the tube network's financial needs published this morning outlined a financial black hole of up to \u00a31.4bn on a third of the capital's underground lines. </p> <p>The latest figures create a severe financial headache for the government when they are added to the projected \u00a32bn funding gap on the rest of the tube system. Transport for London, the London mayor's transport authority, this morning blamed the government and said the Treasury would have to step in.</p> <p>London Underground boss Tim O'Toole said the government must pay because it had imposed the public private partnership programme that parcelled out the tube upgrade operation to private companies. O'Toole has consistently warned that any attempt to cut back on the \u00a330bn upgrade programme would result in chaos because the network is struggling to cope with current levels of demand.</p> <p>\"Any funding required above TfL's budget should be met by continuing support by government, who imposed this PPP structure on the tube and Londoners,\" said O'Toole. </p> <p>Gordon Brown, who brought in the PPP when he was chancellor, and his successor, Alistair Darling, must decide whether to bail out the Conservative mayor of London, Boris Johnson. The mayor's transport adviser, Kulveer Ranger, last week ruled out imposing massive fare rises to raise funds. </p> <p>The scale of the funding gap emerged this morning in a report by the PPP contract referee, Chris Bolt. He said carrying out vital upgrade work on the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines up to 2017 would cost between \u00a35.1bn and \u00a35.5bn. TfL projected it would cost \u00a34.1bn and therefore faces a gap of up to \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p><strong>Metronet's funding needs</strong></p> <p>However, Tube Lines, the private company that owns the PPP contracts for the work, revealed this morning that it thinks the gap could be bigger. It believes the work will cost \u00a37.2bn, implying that it faces an overspend of up to \u00a32.1bn.</p> <p>Metronet, the contractor charged with maintaining two-thirds of the tube, collapsed last year after building up a projected overspend of at least \u00a32bn.</p> <p>In an embarrassing reversal of one of Brown's signature policies as chancellor, Metronet is back in public ownership after it was taken over by TfL. TfL has yet to reveal the funding needs for Metronet up to 2017, amid speculation that it also faces a budget deficit up to 2017 on top of the existing \u00a32bn funding hole \u2014 which covers the period 2003 to 2010. </p> <p>Tube Lines, which is co-owned by a subsidiary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">BAA</a> owner Ferrovial, indicated that the government's role in funding would have to be clarified. In a carefully worded statement this morning, the company did not make a direct reference to the disparity between its cost estimates and TfL's. </p> <p>Instead, it hinted that the government should put in place long-term financial backing for the network, rather than allocating cash every seven years.<br>\"The question is not should the upgrade of the tube cost this much but how is this vital work to be funded? Funding for future tube improvements must be secured and maintained,\" said the company.</p> <p>One of the staunchest critics of the PPP programme warned this morning that cutting back work investment in new trains, signalling systems and tracks would be disastrous for a tube network that carries more than 3 million people on a typical weekday. </p> <p>Professor Stephen Glaister, a former TfL board member and head of transport at Imperial College, said: \"The PPP was claiming to deliver a programme of work over 30 years. That programme cannot be delivered for what the government thought it would cost originally. The work cannot be done, so the government will have to pay a lot more money. If the programme is not carried out, then we have got a serious problem with capacity on the tube in London.\"</p>",

  "<p><br> The exception that proves the rule... Diablo Cody making writing look easy and cool. Photograph: Vince Bucci/Getty</p> <p>Two things. Writers are not cool, and writers always look like crap. Even when they've been styled for big awards ceremonies, you can still see the look of fear in their eyes, and the voluminous bags underneath them. And that's because writing is a bitch.</p> <p>Sometimes the only way I find the inspiration to write is to read about how difficult the process is for other writers. Call it \"screenplay schadenfreude\" if you will (thank you <a href=\"http://www.avenueq.com/\">Avenue Q</a>for bringing that word into my life).</p> <p>I completed my final session at <a href=\"http://www.writersbootcamp.com/\">Writer's Boot Camp</a> this week but I'm struggling to get the first draft finished. My failsafe remedy of going for long bike rides on the beach has left me exhausted not exhilarated. And driving randomly around LA listening to loud music (which is what <a href=\"http://www.new.facebook.com/group.php?gid=33807262256\">Aaron Sorkin</a> does when he hits a wall) simply used up petrol and hurt my ears. I honestly don't know how people find the all important work/write balance, particularly if like me, their day job is writing.</p> <p>A few days ago I'd been writing so much that looking at the computer screen made me nauseous. Lying down made me feel sick, so I stayed up all night on the sofa, eating cheese string, wearing my purple kaftan (a clear sign of a crisis right there), watching all-new episodes of <a href=\"http://www.oxygen.com/tvshows/torianddean/\">Tori and Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood</a>. I told you, writers are not cool.</p> <p>Surely everyone else in class was having a hard time? Turns out, not. It became clear that I hadn't made as much progress as the others, and most of them have jobs (apart from the actors). The chances of me having a completed first draft in 10 days is slim to none and now I have the added pressure of trying not to beat myself up about it. The trouble with a first draft is that it rarely hits the page the way it sounds, and looks, in your head.</p> <p>I heard that <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/\">Juno</a>'s shooting script was a first draft but I don't believe it. First drafts are always terrible and that makes them slightly depressing to write. You know that the hours you are about to put in are, if not wasted, then completely irrelevant to what the film might end up being.</p> <p>Of course you never know what's around the corner with anything you write.

Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen, living room, I think I counted three flat screen TVs, and a balcony. Who has a balcony with tables and chairs?\") but film festivals can be brutal. \"We couldn't find a party last night,\" she moaned via Facebook IM. \"We eventually found a bar, but the doorman wouldn't let us in, and I was wearing my special outfit from New Year!\" Such is the lot of a writer.

The 30-year-old actor from Palo Alto, California, has a brace of very different new films in the traps - first, the druggy action comedy Pineapple Express, and then Milk, Gus Van Sant's biopic of the gay politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. (Franco plays his lover, Scott Smith, with Sean Penn as Milk.)</p> <p>He has also just become the face of Gucci's latest fragrance; you can see him in the obligatory moody ad campaign, strolling through empty rooms in a snappy suit whilst speaking the lyrics to Roxy Music's 'Slave to Love'. Don't laugh. We've all done it.</p> <p>And he has just started an MA in directing and writing, after graduating from UCLA with a degree in English literature. The media has tended to greet these academic pursuits with the same level of suspicion that would be reserved for celebrity advocates of devil worship or macram\u00e9. No matter. Franco is sincerely happy in his studies, as well as his work. </p> <p>And yet he is bellowing at me as though we are seated at opposite ends of the Royal Albert Hall, rather than on either side of a coffee table in a London hotel room. Eventually he confesses that he has a mild hang-up about his voice. In 2001, he took the title role in a TV film called James Dean, trousering an Emmy for his trouble. His performance did not want for acclaim, but some comments, intended admiringly, stuck in his craw.</p> <p>\"People kept saying to me, 'God, you played that guy like he was high the whole time',\" Franco recalls. \"So then I got a complex. I guess people think I'm stoned the whole time because of the way I talk.\"</p> <p>You take his point. When he isn't booming and projecting to stop people thinking he's high, he has a tendency to drawl seductively, turning each word into a protracted purr. The general perception that he was born with a Camberwell carrot in his mouth can only become more widespread with the opening of Pineapple Express. This weirdly violent, dope-fuelled comedy, which pays unnecessary homage to crap 80s action movies, has its bright spots, and all of them are due to Franco's beatific turn as Saul Silver, a drug dealer with a Cheshire Cat grin, lank locks and a slacker-chic wardrobe of PJs and faded Ts. In reality, the actor is almost offensively handsome - dark hair, come-<em>back</em>-to-bed eyes, cheekbones like spirit-levels. Today he is stretched out on the sofa in dark blue jeans with a checked shirt buttoned over a white singlet. Any man in his company begins inevitably to resemble Ernest Borgnine by comparison.</p> <p>Pineapple Express - produced by Judd Apatow, co-written by its star Seth Rogen and named after a powerful (and fictional) strain of weed - is a departure for Franco, although from what remains slightly unclear. Any Franco-phile knows he can hold his own in everything from Apatow's much-loved, short-lived TV show Freaks and Geeks to the Spider-Man trilogy (where he plays Harry Osborn, aka Son of the Green Goblin) or any of the sombre parts he has taken on in between, from a homeless junkie in City By The Sea to a hustler in Sonny. But there's little sense of who Franco is, or where his strengths lie, other than in his kamikaze, Method-style willingness to go that extra hundred miles for films which invariably transpire to be notable only for his contribution to them. (He slept rough to prepare for City By The Sea, and hung out with a real-life hustler for Sonny, even sitting in on - but not, he insists, participating in - a cocaine-doused threesome in a New Orleans hotel room. Both films sank without trace.) </p> <p>Pineapple Express and Milk represent the start of an unofficial campaign to reveal who Franco is, and what makes him special. The former unleashes what Apatow has called \"the funny Franco,\" so far witnessed only by fans of Freaks and Geeks. But while he's a riot in the film, his videos for the website <a href=\"www.funnyordie.com\">Funny Or Die</a> reveal his comic dexterity just as clearly. In a quartet of self-mocking shorts, collected under the title Acting With James Franco, he lampoons himself as he attempts to teach his kid brother Dave the rudiments of his art. You might wonder how a performer who has not yet established a persona manages to send it up, but Franco's target is the self-absorption of the average pompous ass. For those who have followed his career, an additional frisson comes from seeing him turn on his own largely humourless body of work. (\"James is always crying!\" complains his mother on the website before a montage of her son's tearful on-screen breakdowns.)</p> <p>Even Sony, the studio which produced Pineapple Express, had expressed reservations about casting Franco as Saul, given his dour track record. \"This was the same studio that made all the Spider-Man films. They'd worked with me for, like, six years. But they said, 'Well, we just don't know about James doing comedy.'\" Apatow convinced them by roping Franco in for a cameo in Knocked Up. \"I had no idea that Judd was using it as my comedy audition piece for the studio.\" The Funny Or Die material was the icing on the cake, and Franco says proudly that he never heard another gripe from his paymasters during the making of Pineapple Express. \"The only note we got from up high was: THERE MUST BE NO BLOOD ON THE MAIN ACTORS' FACES. Of course, by the end of the movie I have a broken nose and blood running down my face.\" He shrugs. \"So I guess we broke that rule.\"</p> <p>Acting With James Franco has been important too for allowing him to vent some of his frustration at the turgid work in which he had become mired. \"I was unhappy with a few of the movies I'd done. So it was a way, as you say in England, to take the piss.\" He has voiced his discontentment before with forgotten pictures like Tristan + Isolde and Annapolis, but I'm concerned that he is tarring with that same brush his work in Robert Altman's beautifully fleet-footed movie The Company, in which he had a handful of brief but disarming scenes.</p> <p>Tell me you weren't unhappy with The Company, I ask him.<br>\"I - um - no!\" He pauses. \"The Company?\" he repeats, sounding mildly baffled.<br>You remember, I say - the Robert Altman film where you played a chef and you cooked scrambled eggs for Neve Campbell.<br>\"I know! I know what The Company is!\" he splutters, returning his coffee cup to the table so as not to spill it. \"I know who directed the film - I was in it! I wasn't smoking that much pineapple express.\" He's laughing and shaking his head now, and I feel a wee bit stupid. </p> <p>But no, he wouldn't badmouth The Company. He calls working with Altman \"one of the greatest experiences of my life\" and says they had another project ready to roll when the director died in November 2006. Franco likens his directing style to that of Gus Van Sant. \"It's weird. Gus seems like he's doing so little. What he does, like Altman, is to make you feel like you're not being directed at all. It's still baffling to me because I've made short films and tried that approach myself and I had mixed results.\"</p> <p>I ask if it's true that he and Sean Penn - both renowned for the intensity of their work process - were considering shacking up together during the shooting of Milk. \"Hey, who told you that?\" he asks, a sly smile forming on his lips. I think he likes the idea that such rumours, which riff on his penchant for preparation, have begun doing the rounds. \"Sean and I did talk about spending the night together on the set where we did the apartment scenes, but it never happened.\"</p> <p>He has, though, already started wheeling out saucy tales from the making of the movie on the US chat-show circuit, such as how he wore an overly flattering prosthetic penis to spare his blushes in a nude scene, only for Penn to think it was the real thing. And that old chestnut, which every young actor who has played a gay scene must by law recount, about how strange it was to kiss another man. But Franco talks reverently about the film itself, which he saw only recently. \"It's great,\" he says simply, lowering his voice for perhaps the first time. \"It couldn't have turned out better.\" </p> <p>Pineapple Express opens on Friday</p>",
  "<p>As Quentin Tarantino will happily tell you, the grindhouse occupied a unique position in American film-going culture. Taking on the nickname as well as the premises of the old burlesque joints of New York's 42nd Street, they offered audiences a generous, if variable, diet of genre filler and exploitation material. In recent years, the venues have gone the Disneyfied way of all midtown scuzzery, and admirers of the movies they showed can now order most of them on Netflix.</p> <p>Last week, though, the BAM cin\u00e9matek, Brooklyn's premiere bastion of foreign-language and low-budget independent film exhibition, transformed from arthouse to grindhouse with a short season of John Carpenter films. Antarctic shocker The Thing was playing, along with San Francisco-set chop-socky tribute Big Trouble in Little China, LA corporate satire They Live and one movie with a distinctly local flavour: Escape from New York.</p> <p>Released in 1981 and set in 1997 \u2013 \"NOW\", the credits insist \u2013 the picture envisages a dystopian future in which a walled-off Manhattan has become the US's maximum-security hole, a lawless jailzone in which feral gangs maraud through downtown and the local warlord (Isaac Hayes) cruises his streets in a tricked-out ride with chandeliers for headlights. This, you suspect, is what Travis Bickle was afraid of. In a plot that plays out somewhat like Mad Max Goes to Manhattan, outlaw Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is dispatched to retrieve the President (Donald Pleasence) after Air Force One goes down over the island.</p> <p>The atmosphere at the screening was pretty grindhousey \u2013 at least for a classy joint like BAM. There were whoops and cheers as the credits began, especially for Pleasence, Hayes and Lee Van Cleefe, who plays police chief Hauk. Certain characters were applauded on their first appearance and generally unfunny jokes yelled out from certain parts of the auditorium. (When Pleasence is addressed as \"Mr President\" while tied up and wearing a blonde wig, one wag offered the immortal heckle: \"Mrs President!\")</p> <p>The print, whether through accident or design, also played into the theme: scratched and crackly, it had the fuzzy, supersaturated quality of a copy that has done the rounds. The punchline to one sequence was even missed when the projector skipped to the next reel \u2013 an effect Tarantino and his Grindhouse co-director Robert Rodriguez worked hard to replicate artificially.</p> <p>Carpenter has said he was inspired by Death Wish's portrayal of New York as \"a jungle\", if not by that film's politics, and he delivered an apt fantasia for the start of the 80s, when the city's edges were arguably at their roughest. By the time the actual 1997 rolled around, of course, the Giuliani effect had smoothed most of them to a corporate sheen, and the film seemed safely camp \u2013 partly thanks to touches like Plissken's tight, patterned jeans and mobile phones larger than characters' heads. The streets of New York today feel as safe to walk as they did a decade ago, but they have seen more trauma, and the movie's off-screen geopolitics \u2013 the president is embroiled in<br>a precarious stand-off with Russia and China, apparently over energy resources \u2013 seem less quaint these days.</p> <p>Escape from New York offers unignorable moments of resonance with 9/11, not least in its use of a plane as a suicide weapon targeting Lower Manhattan. \"We're going in, we're going to crash,\" squawks the radio as Air Force One bears down on the Twin Towers, prompting one audience member to blurt \"Oh, my God,\" in amused astonishment. Soon after, Plissken's one-man glider zeroes in on the WTC as well; having landed on its roof and descended its east stairwell, he finds plane wreckage on the streets and paper fluttering to the ground.</p> <p>Carpenter has also said his story was partly inspired by Watergate and the disenchantment with the office of the Presidency that it provoked. Pleasence is a tetchy, resentful presence here, less Bush than Cheney, though his climactic gung-ho turn with a machine gun does get one particular mission accomplished. Early in the picture, Hauk reminds Plissken that the US is at war and needs its president alive. \"I don't give a fuck about your war,\" he replies. \"Or your president.\" That earned the auditorium's biggest cheer of the evening.</p>",
  "<p>Two newspapers - <a href=\"http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/\">The News</a> in Portsmouth and its sister weekly, the <a href=\"http://www.chichester.co.uk/\">Chichester Observer</a> - have successfully challenged a ban on identifying a man jailed for eight months for possessing 697 indecent images of children. A judge sitting at Chichester magistrates' court overturned the ban imposed by magistrates following a letter from the <strong>Press Association's</strong> legal editor <strong>Mike Dodd</strong>, supported by the two papers.
