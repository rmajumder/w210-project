  "<p>In recent speeches Tory leaders have focused on how (bad) behaviour can be made good. The \"nudge\" version is convenient; it meshes with the state doing less and citizens doing more for themselves. \"We were distracted by being overly concerned with government and not enough with citizens and how they react,\" Oliver Letwin, the thinker in chief on the Tory frontbench, commented.<br> The health spokesman Andrew Lansley made a speech to the thinktank Reform attacking the \"nannying\" state. The alternative (which some might consider just as much nannying) is buck-up-your-ideas talk. \"People need to know that the buck stops with them,\" he said. \"They can't shuffle off the responsibility.\" Lansley himself acknowledged the nannying nature of trying to deal with obese children, when he said they needed more of a Mary Poppins than a Miss Trunchbull, the fearsome headteacher created by Roald Dahl. </p> <p>Lansley envisages a \"responsibility deal\", based on a \"nonbureaucratic partnership with the business community\". This contrasts with \"constant and escalating resort to legislation and regulation and public sector intervention\".</p> <p>Practically, it would mean for instance, not enforcing EU proposals for mandatory food labelling. Lansley has rejected a \"traffic light\" labelling system for food and is backing instead the food industry's preferred system, based on a guideline daily amount. This more relaxed view has not gone down well with health bodies. But the question is whether relying on people's thirst for information is going to change their behaviour.</p> <p>If the Tories do come into power at Westminster, would they really rely on \"learning through failure\" and do away with punishment for minor misdemeanours, as some of them are now saying?</p> <p>The evidence base for interventions by the government has many gaps. A recent book, How public service advertising works, has shed some light on the effectiveness of government campaigns, but for the most part, the relationship remains dim.</p> <p>The Tories are certainly trying to learn. Frontbenchers met Richard Thaler, the economist and promoter of the nudge idea, earlier this summer.</p> <p>David Cameron wants government to take the lead but not be obtrusive and always work with the grain of incentives. People will alter their ways: \"with the right prompting we'll change our behaviour to fit in with what we see around us\". That could mean, as Cameron has proposed, sending energy bills that tell households whether they are using more or less energy than their neighbours; the aim is to use subtle peer pressure to encourage households to become more energy efficient.</p> <p>But is that so very different from, say, existing encouragement of recycling, which some Tory spokespeople have rejected? The Taxpayers Alliance, which is close to the Tory party, singled out for attack advertisements by local councils for \"environmental volunteers\", who would report issues such as fly-tipping, dog fouling and abandoned vehicles. When Exeter city council became the first local authority to announce it will fine residents who put normal waste into their green recycling bins, shadow local government minister Eric Pickles described it as the result of Labour policies, which had left the council with little choice. Pickles said people \"genuinely want to improve recycling and go green\", but Labour's policies would be counter-productive, he said, and could result in a \"surge in fly-tipping\".</p> <h2>Dependency</h2> <p>Letwin, meanwhile, has spoken about weaning people off dependency on the state as civil society strengthens, involving families, neighbourhoods, voluntary bodies, community groups and social enterprises. He and Lansley<br>talk the language of empowerment, or, as Lansley put it in his Reform speech, \"leadership, role models and social marketing approaches\" to tell teenagers about \"the positive empowerment they can achieve by choosing healthy living\". There's an interesting shift, too, away from the idea of scaling up successful local schemes into national projects and towards the notion of reproducing such schemes in different places. That would require a tolerance of local differences that seems at odds with the usual outcry over \"postcode lottery\" when exactly such local differences come to light, in areas such as health. </p> <p>Tory interest in behaviour change seems to be limited when it comes to welfare policy. Here, policy is certainly aimed at weaning people off long-term welfare dependence, but hardly through any fresh ideas about behaviour change or peer pressure. Instead, the policy is clear: people who refuse to join a return to work programme will lose the right to claim out of work benefits until they do; people who refuse to accept reasonable job offers could lose the right to claim out of work benefits for three years; and there will be time limits: people who claim for more than two years out of three will be required to join community work programmes. That's the sound of the levers of central government in action.</p> <p>\u2022 This article appears in the latest edition of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public\">Public</a> magazine</p>",
  "<p>Governments have always tried to influence behaviour. If public administration is, in part, a science, it's also an art, dealing in norms and values and subjective states. Certain behaviour is deemed acceptable while other ways of acting are not. Sometimes a Millite test is applied \u2013 following the Victorian philosopher John Stuart Mill \u2013 behaviour that only affects individuals is deemed to be outside government purview. But behaviour that impinges on others deserves to be controlled.</p> <p>One dimension of policy has always been about changing behaviour, either through law, which criminalises particular actions, or measures to encourage desired behaviour.</p> <p>What is new is the realisation that the government needs to go beyond programmes to deliver services. Despite large increases in public spending, social problems persist and they are connected to detrimental ways of living and thinking. Criminalising actions are not effective as changing or at least influencing people.</p> <h2>Collaboration</h2> <p>Education, health and policing are more effective if parents, pupils, patients and the community collaborate. Children whose parents encourage them to behave at school and do their homework are more likely to do well than those who don't, patients who follow their doctor's advice are more likely to get well quicker (or stop getting sick at all) and the police will have less to do if a community censures and detects unacceptable behaviour. In short, changing behaviour can help improve outcomes.</p> <p>Public managers have a much better understanding of the range of options available to try and change behaviour than they did in decades past. Traditional mechanisms emphasised legal constraint. Now they use behavioural economics, psychology and neuroscience.</p> <p>\"All my physical science colleagues are saying we need more social science,\" says Paul Wiles, head of social research in the Home Office and chief government social scientist. Biological responses to obesity, for example, are well understood \u2013 eat less and exercise more \u2013 but how to make people do it? So the Food Standards Agency now has a social scientist advisory committee in addition to committees of biologists and physicists.</p> <h2>Psychologists</h2> <p>Whitehall, however, seems uncertain about the status of social science, apart from economics. There is a fast stream for social scientists but social science expertise, once concentrated in a special unit located in the Cabinet Office, is dissipated through the various departments. Whitehall employs very few psychologists.</p> <p>Changing behaviour these days is more about positive mechanisms, about communicating and incentivising rather than proscribing particular actions. This has been the Labour way since 1997 on obesity, sexual health, recycling, energy use and welfare to work. Benefits policy changed the emphasis from paying money to the unemployed to supporting those who actively looked for work (with the threat of cutting benefits if they did not attend interviews or accept job offers).</p> <p>Behaviour is not just how people think and act, it's context and opportunity. However hard it is hard to change the propensity to commit a crime, what Roman Catholics used to call occasions for sin can be cut. Car theft has been cut as a result of improvements in alarms and other security measures.</p> <p>Deterrence may matter less than perception of the difficulty or cost of breaching norms of behaviour. The certainty of getting caught may be more important than the nature of the punishment.</p> <p>Policy makers tend to look at behavioural problems in isolation. They often mount campaigns to persuade people off drugs, reduce teenage pregnancy or cut obesity as if these could be separated from a host of contingent and related issues. Advertising about the pains and penalties of drug addiction, for example, has highlighted the issue, but has had little impact on the scale of addiction because policy has not addressed the causes of substance misuse and treatment for addicts has been limited.</p> <p>In contrast, reductions in road deaths have been based on a combination of tactics. Adverts showing what difference driving more slowly makes to a pedestrian's chances of surviving being run over were shocking, but road engineering (speed bumps) forced motorists to change their behaviour in the most significant fashion and slow down. </p> <p>Attempting to change behaviour may imply identifying groups, leaving public managers open to the charge of discrimination. Initiatives may impose conditions, but only for disadvantaged groups \u2013 the unemployed, those on housing benefits or the disabled.</p> <p>Does behaviour \"trickle down\" from the top of society \u2013 for example in terms of recycling household waste or eating more healthily? The affluent and educated are not always role models of course and there may be social resistance to following their lead. Behavioural change certainly relates to income. With money comes choices. Those least able to exercise choice may adopt a fatalist view of life as something that happens to them. Incentives to change behaviour end up rewarding those with more confidence and influence.</p> <p>\u2022 This article appears in the latest edition of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public\">Public</a> magazine</p>",
  "<p>Britain found itself thrown into the US presidential election after the leak of a letter from its ambassador to Washington, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, offering a frank assessment of Barack Obama, commenting on his inexperience and aloofness as well as his intelligence and \"star quality\".</p> <p>The leak of the seven-page letter to Gordon Brown undermines British efforts to abide by the convention of neutrality in US elections.</p> <p>The letter is mainly complimentary about Obama but also highlights his perceived weaknesses. Sheinwald wrote that Obama \"does betray a highly educated and upper middle class mindset\". He adds that accusations of elitism \"are not entirely unfair\" and he is \"maybe aloof, insensitive\" at times.</p> <p>The ambassador, who was last night in Los Angeles, suggested in the letter that an Obama presidency could present problems for the UK over his plan to negotiate directly with the Iranian leadership.</p> <p>Although Brown is ideologically closer to the Democrats, he has tried to remain neutral between Obama and his Republican rival John McCain, though an article written in his name last month which praised Obama caused embarrassment. </p> <p>The British embassy in Washington said last night: \"We do not comment on leaked documents. We are totally neutral as far as the US elections are concerned and we look forward to working closely with whoever is elected.\"</p> <p>The letter, leaked to the Daily Telegraph is classified, marked \"sensitive judgements\" and requests officials to \"protect the contents carefully\". It was prepared before Obama's visit to Downing Street in the summer as part of a tour to the Middle East and Europe.</p> <p>A leak inquiry has been launched.</p> <p>The letter will play into the election campaign as it was picked up almost immediately last night on publication by US websites such as Drudge.</p> <p>It is part of the job of the ambassador to offer such assessments of an incoming president and Sheinwald has been out on the campaign trail, including attending the Democratic convention in Denver, Colorado, and the Republican one in St Paul, Minnesota, building up portraits of the two candidates. He described Obama's voting record as \"decidedly liberal\" and pointed up his lack of experience. \"Although he has been a member of the Senate foreign relations committee for four years, and a regular attender of meetings in his first two, there is little Obama track record to refer back to,\" he says.</p> <p>He attributed Obama's rise in part to luck, including that \"Hillary Clinton had such a bad organisation in the primary campaign, and took so long to respond to Obama's threat\".</p> <p>Describing Obama's approach to politics, he noted the senator has emerged from the tough Chicago political background but that he \"can seem to sit on the fence, assiduously balancing pros and cons\".</p> <p>He added: \"He can talk too dispassionately for a national campaign about issues which touch people personally, eg his notorious San Francisco comments [in April] about small-town Pennsylvanians 'clinging' to guns and religion.\"</p> <p>Sheinwald, appointed by Tony Blair, has been a relatively low-key presence in Washington compared with some of his predecessors. </p> <p>In the letter, the ambassador also described Obama as \"elegant\", \"mesmerising\", \"highly intelligent\" and having \"star quality\".</p> <p>He anticipated a potential problem over Iran, given Obama's comment that he was prepared to sit down for talks with the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>\"If Obama wins, we will need to consider with him the articulation between (a) his desire for 'unconditional' dialogue with Iran and (b) our and the [United Nations Security Council]'s requirement of prior suspension of enrichment before the nuclear negotiations proper can begin.\"</p> <p>But Obama's Iraq policy of withdrawal fitted in with Britain's.</p> <p>\"Whatever the detail, our own proposed transition in south-east Iraq would be consistent with Obama's likely approach. Obama's ideas on a more expansive regional framework for Iraq would also fit well with our thinking.\"</p> <p>He wrote approvingly of Mr Obama's \"mainstream team of youthful economic advisers, with strong credentials [who] approach policy with refreshingly few prescriptions\", his \"progressive position on climate change\" and his \"pragmatic realism\" and \"balanced approach to the big security issues\".</p> <p>Sir Nigel concludes that searching for a deal between Israel and the Palestinians is \"unlikely to be a top priority for Obama\" and he expresses concern about his protectionist trade policy, while noting that he has \"repositioned himself somewhat towards free trade\".</p>",
  "<p>The Crown Prosecution Service is failing the terminally ill by refusing to be clear about whether their relatives will face criminal charges for helping them to die, the high court heard yesterday.</p> <p>Debbie Purdy, who was diagnosed in 1995 with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, says that when her condition becomes unbearable, she would like her husband, Omar Puente, to accompany her to Switzerland where she can die in comfort. Purdy hopes to use the facilities of Dignitas, the Swiss charity which assists the terminally ill to take their own life, by providing support, facilities and ultimately a fatal dose of barbiturates.</p> <p>Speaking on the first day of the hearing, Purdy's barrister, David Pannick QC, said that although it was illegal to assist a suicide, cases where terminally ill patients were helped to die by loved ones were rarely prosecuted, making the law \"confused and uncertain\". The court heard that although many British people travel to Switzerland every year to die, none of their relatives has faced criminal charges on their return.</p> <p>Purdy says the blind-eye approach of authorities is not good enough. \"I just want clarity so I know whether or not my husband Omar will be prosecuted or questioned by the police if I decide to travel abroad to die and he accompanies me,\" she said. \"I want to know what the law considers to be assisting suicide - is Omar open to prosecution if he helps me into a taxi to the airport, or books my flights?\"</p> <p>Purdy says her condition is such that by the time she is ready to die, she would depend on her husband's help to travel. \"If the law is not clarified, I may be forced to travel alone before I am ready.\" </p> <p>Although her husband, who sat beside her in court, has said he would go with her even if he risked jail, Purdy says she is not willing to take this risk. </p> <p>Not all assisted suicide campaigners agree with Purdy's challenge. Nan Maitland, an 82-year old member of campaign group Friends at the End, watching the case in court yesterday, said: \"People are worried that if this case is unsuccessful it will make it harder for their partners to assist them in ending their lives.\" </p> <p>Purdy's legal team said that they were not seeking immunity from prosecution for her husband, but for more information about when prosecutions were likely. \"It is impossible for someone in [Purdy's] position to get any useful guidance,\" Pannick said, adding that she was \"entitled to a policy\" to protect her right to a private and family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>Purdy's solicitor, Saimo Chahal, questioned whether prosecutions were ever justified in cases of this nature. \"Is it really in the public interest to prosecute people like Omar?\"</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service has said that it will not create a specific policy for assisted suicide but will consider each case individually in deciding whether to prosecute. The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>Two million workers in the UK fear for the future of their job, new research reveals.</p> <p>Citizens advice bureaux are being overloaded by people in short-term jobs worried about being exploited by their bosses. The influx is so great that people at advice centres are finding it hard to access information.</p> <p>Many employers are knowingly taking advantage of workers who live in fear for their livelihood or are ignorant of their rights as employees.</p> <p>These findings have recently been published in the 'Hard work, hidden lives' report, by the Commission on Vulnerable Employment. The investigation highlights the shady practices of many employers who exploit those in low-paid, low-skilled professions such as catering, cleaning or factory work \u2013 jobs often dominated by women.</p> <p>Many of those guilty of exploitation are small businesses that rely on a fast turnover of staff; many are also recruitment agencies that are known to continually re-offend. Much of the evidence in the report has been gathered from Citizens Advice Bureau and Law Centre advisers who report a sharp rise in requests for help. </p> <p>Some 70% of CAB and 80% of Law Centre advisers felt they had too few staff to deal with the number of enquiries they receive. 79% of advisers are receiving weekly reports of unfair dismissal, whilst 67% receive reports of problems with pay each week.</p> <p>One CAB advisor based in the East Midlands describes a typical scenario.</p> <p>\"I have a number of complaints from pubs where they employ cleaners, barmaids and barmen that they do not give any official letter to. They don't give them hours of work. They don't give them terms and conditions of employment. Obviously a problem arises and it tends to be a case of: 'Get out; I can't be doing with you. Go.'\"</p> <p>Jozef is in his thirties and is originally from Poland. He has a degree in enterprise management, an MA in political science, and nearly 15 years of management experience in manufacturing. He came to the UK to develop his language skills and found a job in a food processing plant through a friend.</p> <p>Nearly all his co-workers are migrants, directly employed and on minimum wage. Jozef receives holiday pay but no company sick pay. He works 43 hours a week, in four 10 hour shifts and one half-day. But workers can be sent home if there is not enough work, \"If they don't like somebody, it is very subjective: 'I don't like you, you go. I like you, you stay,'\" he explains.</p> <p>His manager doesn't like workers speaking in Polish and has been known to thrown things at him and swears at him. Jozef has also seen company bonuses being shared between the bosses and the other workers, who are also immigrants, from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Polish workers don't ask for a share of the bonus or challenge the bosses as they fear losing their jobs and do not feel confident expressing themselves in English.</p> <p>The report describes vulnerable work as \"precarious work that places people at risk of continuing poverty and injustice resulting from an imbalance of power in the employer-worker relationship.\" This sums up Jozef's predicament, and that of many others.</p> <p>Professor Anna Pollert from the University of the West of England led the research team. \"While we expected to find poor treatment, its extent has stunned us all,\" she said. \"Worst of all, much of it took place within a legal framework that fails to prevent exploitation.\"</p> <p>The report suggests employment rights should be better publicised and enforced, and that enforcement agencies should work more closely. Unions are also criticised for not doing enough to protect vulnerable workers: only 25% of those in vulnerable employment have union presence in the workplace. </p> <p>As a commissioner of the research the TUC is already responding to the findings. \"Since the report's publication a number of new initiatives have been developed,\" said the union. </p> <p>\"The TUC general council has adopted the CoVE report into formal TUC policy. We are also developing training on vulnerable employment for union reps, which will enable them to better understand how to support workers in precarious employment and enforce employment rights' he added.<br> The union is also increasing their support of migrant workers. They recently signed an agreement with the two Polish trade union confederations, Solidarity and OPZZ, to work together to prevent exploitation among Polish workers in the UK. In addition, they say they will also continue to campaign on issues affecting vulnerable workers, such as agency workers' rights and better enforcement of the national minimum wage.</p> <p>The 'Justice for Cleaners' campaign, in Canary Wharf in London, has proved that unions can protect vulnerable workers. The international campaign, led by Unite, has won better pay and conditions for cleaners at multinational companies based in London's financial districts. Sick pay, holiday pay, pension provision and London weighting are the modest aims of the campaign.</p> <h2>Useful phone numbers</h2> <p><strong>The National Minimum Wage helpline:</strong> 0845 6000 678<br><strong>Gangmasters Licensing Authority:</strong> 0845 602 5020<br><strong>Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate:</strong> 0845 955 5105<br><strong>Health and Safety Executive:</strong> 0845 345 0055<br><strong>Acas:</strong> 08457 47 47 47</p>",
  "<p>In the evening the temperature falls at last and light slants across the camp, throwing long shadows across the stagnant puddles and shining through the kites, made from plastic bags, that the children fly. </p> <p>It shines, too, through the thin walls of the makeshift tents that cover a patch of wasteland in the west of Kabul. The 3,500 refugees who live in them are a long way from their homes in the badlands of the south where the British are fighting. Most of the refugees are from districts such as Sangin, Nawazad, Kajaki or Gereshk in the southern province of Helmand, sites of fierce battles between British troops and the Taliban. </p> <p>Their stories reveal a different side of the conflict. Few understand who is fighting, even fewer distinguish between British troops and those of other nationalities, all tell stories of civilians killed by coalition air strikes. There is little sign of progress in the campaign to win hearts and minds.</p> <p>Rozi Khan, a day labourer from Kajaki, said he had no idea which soldiers were fighting around his village when he left two months ago. In fact, securing Kajaki with its strategically important reservoir and dam has been a British objective since the initial days of the deployment in 2006. Last week British soldiers successfully transported a huge turbine to the dam, which could eventually supply nearly 2 million people with electricity. Coalition spokesmen claimed to have killed more than 250 Taliban during the operation. </p> <p>But there is little evidence of material improvement on the ground, according to the refugees. \"They say they have come to help us but they have come for fighting,\" Khan, 25, said. \"But instead of killing one person who has attacked them they kill 50 people in the village. Is this a help?\" </p> <p>Bismatullah, who like many Afghans uses only one name, said \"the Americans\" and the Taliban were fighting around his home in Sangin, again in the British zone of operations. He too spoke of how large numbers of civilians had been killed and buildings destroyed. Independent confirmation of the claim was unavailable. </p> <p>Bismatullah, 32, was nostalgic for the days when the Taliban were in power. \"There was peace and security and no real fighting. The Taliban were following the path of the Qur'an,\" he said.</p> <p>Such sentiments appear widespread. Many refugees interviewed said that the insurgents had not bothered them; others said that, as they had nothing, the Taliban had accepted their refusal to provide food. \"They came asking but I showed them my children who are hungry and have no clothes and they left me alone. They get food from the richer people,\" said one farmer from Sangin. </p> <p>Elsewhere, however, the refugees said the Taliban demanded food, lodging or even volunteers. \"If you have nothing else to give them you have to go with them and they give you a gun and you have to fight. They haven't committed any atrocities but people are afraid of them,\" said another Sangin resident. </p> <p>Often, villagers made a distinction between local Taliban they knew personally, such as those apparently operating in Kajaki district, and those who came from elsewhere, sometimes Pakistan, with whom they had more trouble. The real problem, most said, was not the Taliban or the \"Amriki\", as western troops are universally known, but the combination of the two. </p> <p>\"We had to leave because the Taliban were coming to our village and firing once or twice and there would be a big bombardment and some civilians would die,\" Ahmed Shah, from Nawazad district, said. The word bombardment has been integrated into local languages. </p> <p>Nato spokesmen frequently allege that the Taliban deliberately invite attacks that will kill civilians in order to turn local populations against the international forces and the Afghan government they support. Taliban spokesmen deny the charge. The situation is muddied further as local officials and tribal elders often inflate the number of civilian casualties for political gain or more compensation. </p> <p>But that the villagers are caught in the crossfire is without doubt. Nor is their extreme poverty. Most are landless labourers forced to travel to seek work. For them the war brings particular problems.</p> <p>\"If I went out of my village I risked being shot by the government as a Taliban spy or shot by the Taliban as a government spy,\" said one refugee from the central Oruzgan province, where Dutch and US soldiers are deployed. \"The government holds the district centres, the Taliban run everything outside.\" </p> <p>Most of the refugees are destitute, often having borrowed money or sold their last possessions to travel by truck to Kabul. The unauthorised camp has been established on unused government land. There is no sanitation and summer temperatures reach 40C (104F). They live on scraps of stale bread scavenged from rubbish piles across the city. </p> <p>As a widow with four young children, Gul Pari is in a worse situation than many. She said her husband, a labourer, was killed a year ago in Helmand in a \"bombardment\" but is unsure which side was to blame. \"When there was fighting, we did not know what was going on. But I think it was the fault of the Taliban because they were shooting and then there was an attack afterwards. Now we have nothing except the 50 Afghani [65p] each day that my son gets from selling ice creams.\" </p> <p>The refugees have received blankets and plastic sheets from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and an initial ration of food from the government, and are helped by local businessmen. </p> <p>\"They are in a poor situation but are better off than many other such communities around the country who are less visible,\" said Mohammed Nader Farhad of the UNHCR. \"Especially in the south and east there are problems with displacement due to military operations. Most people want to go home but can't due to the fighting.\" </p> <p>Government estimates place the number of internally displaced by the conflict at 10,000, though aid agencies believe the true total is seven times greater. </p> <p>Said Ali, who last month fled the Helmand town of Gereshk, where British troops have struggled for two years to stabilise a secure zone, said: \"There was fighting with the Taliban and local people shooting at the soldiers and then the planes were coming. My house was destroyed, my animals were killed, my brother injured. We have nothing there and we have nothing here.\"</p> <p>Ali was unsure of the future. \"When there is peace we will go home but now there is war,\" he said. </p> <p>For a few autumn months at least the temperatures will be relatively pleasant and the dust storms will end. But then the vicious Kabul winter will come.</p>",
  "<p>One of Lebanon's most talented and thought-provoking film-makers, Randa Chahal, has died aged 54 in Paris after a long battle with cancer. Like many Lebanese film-makers, her documentary and feature films were made with foreign funds and her work was better known outside Lebanon, but her subjects, for the most part, centred on the tiny and politically troubled Mediterranean country of her birth. Her work gained numerous international prizes, most recently the 2003 Silver Lion at the Venice film festival for her film Le Cerf-volant (The Kite), a love story that takes place on the Golan Heights in a Druze village separated by the Israeli occupation.</p> <p>Chahal was born in Tripoli, Lebanon. Her mother, a Christian originally from Baghdad, married a Sunni Muslim. Chahal was educated by nuns at the St Vincent de Paul school in Tripoli. A long-time Communist party member, she never hesitated to scold the radical Islamists in her neighbourhood or to lob a grenade out of the window, when necessary, during the civil war. Her sister, Nahla, became a militant at the age of 14 and worked for the Organisation for Communist Action in Lebanon (OACL). </p> <p>But it was their father who introduced Chahal to the cinema, at Tripoli's cin\u00e9-club. He agreed to allow her to study film at the Louis Lumi\u00e8re school in Paris on her own in the early 1970s - an exceptional move for a young woman from a conservative city. When the civil war began in 1975, she returned to Lebanon and began to make documentaries. The OACL used Chahal as a messenger, giving her some freedom of movement, which helped to shape her experience of the civil war. </p> <p>Much of her early work is in documentary form and includes Nos Guerres Imprudentes (Our Heedless Wars), a look at how her family dealt with the civil war, which was an official selection at the 1995 Locarno film festival. Her documentary, Souha: Surviving Hell, followed the Lebanese activist Soha (Souha) Bechara as she revisited the Khiam detention centre, where she had been held for 10 years.</p> <p>Chahal turned to feature films, shooting \u00c9crans de Sable (Sand Screens) in 1991 and Les Infid\u00e8les in 1997. The latter controversially told the story of an irresistible attraction between two men - a Muslim fundamentalist and a French diplomat living in Cairo. </p> <p>Her 1999 film, Civilis\u00e9es (A Civilised People), enjoyed critical success abroad, winning a prize in New York, but was screened just once at the Beirut international festival and subsequently fell foul of the censors (50 of its 97 minutes were cut), proving Chahal's point that Lebanon was still in the grip of a collective amnesia about its 15-year civil war. Civilis\u00e9es is one of the most scathing features made about the Lebanese war. Seen through the eyes of maids from various developing nations working for wealthy Lebanese, militants - but also civilians - career madly around the country in a bloody comedy. Chahal cast her brother, Tamim, in the role of a bored sniper, who, in an unforgettable scene, is camped out on top of a building with a dead man with whom he plays cards, carefully arranging them between the corpse's stiffened fingers.</p> <p>When Chahal won the Silver Lion for The Kite, it was a personal triumph, in large part because it legitimised her in her own country - it was her first film released for the general public and she was made Chevalier of the Order of the Cedar by former president \u00c9mile Lahoud.</p> <p>Chahal was deeply saddened by the suicide in 2005 of one of her staunch backers, the French producer Humbert Balsam, who had enabled Arab film-makers, including Youssef Chahine and Elia Suleiman, to realise their films. But she forged ahead with several projects that were in progress at the time of her death, including a musical comedy entitled Too Bad for Them, and a screenplay about Gertrude Bell, the powerful British diplomat responsible in part for drawing the boundaries of the provinces that became modern-day Iraq. </p> <p>Chahal's premature death leaves a void in the Middle Eastern world of film, where freedom of expression requires boundless courage and tenacity.</p> <p>She is survived by her three children, who live in Paris.</p> <p>\u2022 Randa Chahal Sabbag, film-maker and screenwriter, born December 11 1953; died August 25 2008</p>",
  "<p>'They have waited until something has cracked and then at the last moment have sought to prevent total collapse.\" Those words, which could so easily have come from one of the congressional representatives who this week voted down the proposed federal bail-out of the American banking industry, were spoken by Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932.</p> <p>A precipitous collapse in stock market prices, millions defaulting on mortgage repayments, an unpopular president blamed for neglecting the plight of ordinary Americans. As the current economic crisis in the US unfolds, many people are asking whether this is history repeating itself. Are we witnessing a rerun of the stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression? What lessons can be, or should have been, learned from that earlier national emergency?</p> <p>\"The past,\" once observed Pulitzer prizewinning author Robert Penn Warren, \"is always a rebuke to the present.\" And there are certainly clear parallels between the present crisis and events of eight decades ago. In both cases, the economic collapse came after a period of political dominance by the Republican party. The 1920s saw three successive Republican politicians elected to the White House: Warren G Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. These administrations shared a fervent commitment to laissez faire capitalism, encouraging growth through tax cuts, low interest rates and minimum business regulation. Coolidge encapsulated Republican faith in the free market economy in the aphoristic observation: \"The business of America is business.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the last three decades have been a period of renewed Republican party hegemony, interrupted only by the two terms that Bill Clinton served as president. Successive administrations have championed the growth of commerce unfettered by government regulation. Even Clinton, a political centrist who abandoned many of the progressive legacies of Democratic presidents such as Roosevelt and Lyndon B Johnson, did little to control the excesses of Wall Street.</p> <p>In the 1920s, as now, political leaders created the conditions that precipitated economic crisis. In both instances, a lack of effective regulatory oversight fostered a climate of reckless speculation on the stock market. And just like the federal government in 1929, the current administration failed to see the emergency coming.</p> <p>\"I have no fears for the future of our country,\" boasted Hoover at his inaugural address in March 1929. \"It is bright with hope. We shall soon be in sight of the day when, God willing, poverty will be banished from this nation.\" Seven months later, the stock market crash precipitated an economic crisis unprecedented in the nation's history.</p> <p>In a speech last November, George Bush emphasised the continuing growth of the American economy. \"Sure, there's some challenges facing us,\" he complacently suggested, \"but the underpinnings of our economy are strong.\" Even as warnings that the country was heading towards disaster became louder, the president emphasised his administration was \"on top of the situation\". Given his earlier optimism, the recent televised address in which Bush predicted that the US faces a \"long and painful recession\" was a painful admission of his lack of foresight.</p> <p>The American economy still has a long way to fall before it reaches the depths of the Great Depression, of course. The US is technically still not even in a recession, and only just over 6% of American workers are out of a job. The economic situation is nonetheless hurting many ordinary Americans who are losing their jobs, finding themselves with little disposable income and defaulting on mortgage loans. It is also important to recall that Americans did not experience the worst excesses of the Great Depression until some years after the stock market crash. We may not yet have felt the full force of the current crisis.</p> <p>The suffering that followed the crash of 1929 was appalling. From 1929 to 1933, farm income halved, industrial production stood at 40% of capacity and unemployment rose to one in four Americans. Hungry men and women lined the streets for their next meal from the local soup kitchen, homeless people huddled in hastily erected shantytowns on the outskirts of many cities, and thousands hitched rides on railroad cars in search of a job. </p> <p>The collapse of the agricultural economy drove farmers from the land. Dust storms and evictions displaced more than a million rural labourers, whose plight John Steinbeck portrayed in The Grapes of Wrath. Industrial and manufacturing workers fared no better. The coal and textile industries were first to suffer, but were soon followed by other sectors of the economy. Homeless families in Arkansas huddled in caves; others in California found refuge in sewers. \"We saw want and despair walking the streets,\" observed a Chicago social worker, \"and our friends, sensible, thrifty families, reduced to poverty.\" The American birth rate fell to its lowest level while the suicide rate reached its highest.</p> <p>The anguish of the American people is captured in the thousands of letters they wrote to the White House in search of help. One woman from New York State sent a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt in which she asked for a loan to buy clothes for her new baby. \"Please, Mrs Roosevelt,\" she begged, \"I do not want charity, only a chance from someone who will trust me until we can get enough money to repay the amount spent for the things we need.\" As proof of her sincerity, she enclosed in the envelope two of her dearest possessions, a ring worn by her mother and another given to her as a gift by her husband.</p> <p>For African Americans things were even bleaker. The collapse of the cotton market led to the displacement of thousands of black sharecroppers in the southern states. Many migrated to urban areas but racial discrimination restricted their access to jobs and government relief programmes.</p> <p>Once again, minorities, still overrepresented among America's poor, have borne the brunt of the economic burden that now afflicts Americans. Sub-prime mortgage lenders aggressively targeted minorities who otherwise were unable to afford their own homes. According to the Harvard University's Joint Centre for Housing Studies, 55% of African Americans and 45% of Latinos who became homeowners in 2005 did so through sub-prime mortgages, compared with only 17% of whites. </p> <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis has hit minorities hard, with many suffering foreclosures. Last year, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a lawsuit against sub-prime mortgage lenders it accuses of \"institutionalised racism\" because of their predatory behaviour. Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino civil rights organisation, similarly affirms that high-interest loans to poorer minorities are \"eroding the hard-earned wealth our communities spent decades fighting for\".</p> <p>In 1929, there were few safety nets to catch people whose livelihoods collapsed. With his New Deal, Roosevelt revolutionised the role of government as a provider for the dispossessed through the introduction of such measures as the minimum wage, unemployment relief and aid to dependent children. Despite swingeing cuts to the provision of welfare in recent times, there are now far greater protections in place for ordinary people than in the 1930s.</p> <p>Perhaps as a result, there are also no indications that the current economic crisis is tearing at the social fabric of the US in the same way as the Great Depression. Demonstrations by unemployed and homeless people shook many cities during the 1930s. Fears grew that a fascist demagogue could use grassroots unrest as a means to seize power in Washington, a scenario enacted in Sinclair Lewis' satirical novel It Can't Happen Here. While the US is not about to become a fascist dictatorship, there is a possibility of more serious social unrest should the crisis deepen further.</p> <p>The stakes are high. Bush's handling of the economy may prove decisive to this year's presidential election, as was true in 1932. The dour President Hoover appeared to many Americans uncaring and unable to appreciate the scale of the problem that beset the country. </p> <p>In 1930, Hoover introduced higher trade tariffs to protect American manufacturers from foreign competition. The Smoot-Hawley Act led to a protectionist war between the US and other countries. American exports and imports fell sharply, crippling businesses, which laid off workers in ever higher numbers. The president became so unpopular that the shantytowns erected by homeless people became known as \"Hoovervilles\" and an empty pocket turned inside out a \"Hoover flag\".</p> <p>The public perception that Hoover had failed either to avert or remedy the economic crisis led to his resounding defeat to Democratic challenger Franklin Roosevelt in the presidential election of 1932. Roosevelt won a landslide victory with 22.8m votes to Hoover's 15.7m. How the US government acts now is very important, but while Bush is unlikely to repeat Hoover's mistakes, so far he has lacked the vision of Roosevelt.</p> <p>One of the most striking contrasts between the past and present economic crises concerns presidential rhetoric. \"The only thing we have to fear,\" proclaimed Roosevelt in his inaugural address of March 1933, \"is fear itself.\" The Great Depression had a profound psychological as well as material impact on Americans, shattering their individual and collective self-confidence. In times of unprecedented trouble, Roosevelt sought to restore public optimism through his regular radio broadcasts, the \"fireside chats\" in which he presented himself as not only a politician but a personal friend to ordinary Americans.</p> <p>In sharp contrast, the address that Bush delivered to rally support for the bail-out plan exploited public fears. \"Our entire economy is in danger,\" the president warned. \"Without immediate action by Congress, America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold.\" If the strategy was to scare Congress into endorsing the plan with little or no amendments, it clearly failed. Although the Senate approval of an amended plan places members of the House of Representatives under increasing pressure to support the administration, the outcome of a further vote is still not certain. </p> <p>With his poll rating already disastrously low because of his mishandling of the Iraq war, Bush has suffered a further blow to his credibility as a result of the economic collapse. According to a poll conducted by the American Research Group last month, only 19% of Americans approve of how the president is handling the economy, while 76% disapprove. </p> <p>Unlike Hoover, Bush is not seeking re-election. The crisis in the financial market has nonetheless similarly undermined popular trust in the Republicans while providing political capital for the Democrats. John McCain, who concedes his limited expertise in economic matters, has attempted to reinvent himself as a populist champion against Wall Street. His efforts to dissociate himself from the pro-business policies of the Bush administration appear, however, to be in vain.</p> <p>With the economy now the central issue in the election, Americans are increasingly placing their faith in Barack Obama to deliver the country from its current crisis. In what has been a tightly contested race, that advantage could prove decisive when Americans go to the polls on November 4.</p> <p>A fundamental weakness of the American economy in the 1920s was the unequal distribution of wealth. Although the average wage of workers increased during that decade, the economic elite benefited far more from cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Rather than borrow more, ordinary Americans cut back on consumer purchases, creating chronic deflation. The situation is strikingly similar today. Millions of debt-ridden Americans cannot afford to repay mortgages, triggering a collapse in the housing market.</p> <p>During the presidential campaign of 1932, Roosevelt gave a speech in which he spoke of the failure of the federal government to address the needs of the Forgotten Man. Washington, he asserted, had \"sought temporary relief from the top down rather than permanent relief from the bottom up\". This is precisely the criticism that many Americans are now making about the plan to bail out the banking industry.</p> <p>There is one further lesson from history that the federal government will need to consider should economic conditions deteriorate further. Although much of the blame for the current crisis is attributable to the recklessness of Wall Street, bailing out the economic elites will not address the problems that afflict Main Street. The New Deal programmes of the Roosevelt administration represented an unprecedented expansion of government intervention in the economy. Yet they failed to work. Although Washington provided relief and opportunities to millions of Americans, the country remained in a perilous state. On the eve of US intervention in the second world war, nine million Americans were still out of work. </p> <p>Perhaps the most frightening lesson of history is that the mobilisation for war and the factory-employment opportunities it created accomplished what government economic reform programmes could not. By contrast, the current military conflict in which the US is embroiled only compounds its economic problems. The expenditure of billions of dollars on the war on terror drains resources that could be spent on the domestic economy, imposing a tax burden on ordinary people that restricts their disposable income. Nothing less than a radical restructuring of the economy, from the grassroots up, will fix today's mess.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Clive Webb is reader in American history at the University of Sussex</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday October 9 2008.

  "<p>The Last Gang in Town is back! And although the surviving members of the Clash will be remaining firmly in their rocking chairs, no bank is safe. By the time they head for the hills again, they'll have made out like bandits without firing off a rim-shot, flashing an axe, or even raising a bass in anger. </p> <p>This Monday sees a tri-partite Clash release: the illustrated autobiography The Clash (selling for \u00a330), the live compilation DVD Revolution Rock (\u00a312.99), and the CD Live at Shea Stadium (\u00a311.99). You wait a whole year for more Clash product, and then a three-part cross-promotional multimedia extravaganza comes along all at once. </p> <p>Integrity was high on punk's list of watchwords, and the Clash set themselves particularly lofty standards, promising their fans value for money and no exploitation of their followers. \"There will be no six-quid Clash LP, ever!\" Joe Strummer guaranteed Sounds' David McCullough in 1979, failing to consider the effects of inflation (\u00a36 then is worth approximately \u00a322 now).</p> <p>From the moment they signed a recording contract in 1977, the band were in continual conflict with record company CBS over creative freedom, as celebrated in the third Clash single, Complete Control: \"They said we'll make you lots of mon-ee/ Worry about it later.\" Instead, the band put their mon-ee where their mouths were, going into debt to ensure both the double album London Calling and triple Sandinista! sold for the price of a single LP. </p> <p>In 1979, Joe Strummer told Creem's Dave DiMartino the Clash would only enjoy significant commercial success in America 20 years after the event. \"It'll be like on TV,\" he sneered. \"39 Greats from Old England. That's how you like it over here, don't you? Repackaged nostalgia.\" And so it has come to pass. </p> <p>The Clash's output during their lifetime was prodigious, and there was little unheard material left in the vaults when they finally split in 1985. Once CBS was taken over by Sony in 1988, the repackaged nostalgia begain in the usual forms: compilations and reissues in the USA and the UK. By 1999, when From Here to Eternity, an album of (mostly) previously unreleased live performances, was issued at the same time as Don Letts' Grammy-winning official band documentary, Westway to the World, it looked as though there was nothing left to release, that everything had been already been compiled to completion.</p> <p>But then all the bases were thoroughly covered all over again. By the end of last year, posthumous releases included two double-CD best-ofs, two single CD singles collections (both called The Singles), an expanded B-sides compilation, two triple-CD box-set overviews, an </p> <p>A- and B-sides singles box set, an extravagantly extended 25th Anniversary special edition of London Calling, a programme of remastered CD reissues of the band's entire album back catalogue (including the compilations), a singles video collection, and a DVD reprising and expanding upon that. This from a band that released five albums (The Clash, Give 'Em Enough Rope, London Calling, Sandinista and Combat Rock) in its classic form, followed by one (Cut the Crap) so poorly regarded that it was written out of history and no material from it was ever included on the compilations. Well, at least until its reissue in 2000.</p> <p>In fairness, the nature of the music marketplace has evolved over the years and attitudes to \"old music\" have changed. And, naturally, the Clash and their dependents deserve a pension plan. But what gets the fans tutting in the internet forums is that the band have always refused to admit to a profit motive even while the quality control - never complete with the Clash - has deteriorated.</p> <p>In the case of almost every post-split CD, one or more members of the Clash are given credit for song selection, remixing, sleeve notes and/or cover design. In-house filmmaker and band buddy Don Letts has helmed all official DVDs. Wherever possible, a member of the Clash is also credited with initiating the project, most of which are marketed as munificent gestures to the band's followers. And the content of the releases of \"new\" material is presented not as a business decision, but as the result of some Inspired Clash Discovery. There can be no suggestion that the flood of Clash product has been the result of Sony refusing Complete Control to the band.</p> <p>A typical case: in 2004, the special edition of London Calling came about because Mick Jones chanced upon the long-lost album demos in a seldom-visited lock-up. That's right. While other middle-aged music business veterans make reissue decisions around the conference table, the Clash's schedule is apparently dictated by eureka moments in storage facilities. </p> <p>So what's on offer this time around? Advance publicity for Atlantic Books' 2008 lead non-fiction title promises \"an exciting new book about the Clash, in their own words and pictures\", \"hitherto unseen photographs and interviews\" and \"unprecedented access to the Clash archives\". There's no denying that The Clash is a handsome career overview in the gravitas-bestowing coffee-table style of The Beatles Anthology. Atlantic make no secret of the fact that the Beatles book is their model. </p> <p>But how new is this \"exciting new book\"? The Clash's text derives from interviews filmed for an earlier documentary, in this case Westway to the World. Admittedly, the Beatles book took its interviews from an earlier documentary, too, but the difference is that the Beatles releases - also including three CDs of unreleased material - were staggered over five years and shared the same title, while the Clash's are separated by a nine-year gap, and don't. </p> <p>\"I spent between 12 and 17 hours with each band member,\" says Mal Peachey, the book's editor, who conducted the interviews in 1999. \"Less than a third of each interview was used in the finished film.\" The third that was used is self-evidently the most interesting part of the iceberg, though, and The Clash also includes other interview material that has appeared in print before, most obviously from the Clash On Broadway box-set booklet notes. </p> <p>Many of the professional photographs are well known, and the personal snaps are both familiar and scanty. Similarly, the bulk of the memorabilia is commercial rather than personal. We get a handful of drummer Topper Headon's \"Will this do, Mum?\" postcards home, but there is nothing from Joe Strummer's huge cache of notebooks, draft lyrics and on-the-road souvenirs, which have already been the subject of an impressive 2004 exhibition in London. Peachey denies this material is being held back for a new project from Strummer's estate, and - almost unbelievably - dismisses its omission as inconsequential. Topper's postcards aside, there's little indication that the Clash's direct post-1999 involvement amounts to much more than claiming copyright. </p> <p>The press release and cover sticker for the DVD Revolution Rock announce a new documentary directed by Don Letts, featuring \"a host of rare and previously unreleased live performances\". Instead, it's a collection of 22 live clips, only a quarter of them attributable to Letts, only seven not previously included on Clash releases, with a hackneyed voiceover narration. Just to reinforce the distinctive aroma of old hat, Revolution Rock was released in the USA this April, and has been available via Amazon ever since. </p> <p>\"Legendary\" and \"long sought after by fans\", claims the press release for the CD Live at Shea Stadium. The band played two nights at Shea, on October 12 and 13 1982. Producer Glyn Johns recorded both - though persistent buzzing ruined the first night - and Don Letts filmed part of the second for a video promo. The intention was to release a live album in late 1983 to fill an unusually long gap between Clash studio releases. In the event, work was suspended when guitarist Mick Jones was sacked and the writs started flying. </p> <p>Moving house 15 years later, Joe Strummer found a cassette of the second show in his woodshed (it's another Inspired Clash Discovery). Eureka! The project was revived - but shortly afterward, the Clash opted instead to release a live compilation representing all the stages of their career. For much of From Here to Eternity's development, eight of the album's 17 tracks were still due to come from the Shea tapes. Then, at the last minute, seven of these were replaced by superior versions from an earlier 1982 concert. </p> <p>Hardly a vote of confidence in a full release for Shea, then. Similarly, while The Clash takes great pains to point out - and most fans agree - that the \"real\" Clash was the one with the cordon-bleu drumming of Headon, Shea dates from the period following his dismissal and replacement by the more meat-and-two-veg Terry Chimes. </p> <p>There are other reasons why this is a peculiar choice of show to release. The Clash were supporting the Who, playing to a borrowed audience in the alien surroundings and acoustic nightmare of a baseball stadium. In the rain. \"Off balance, out of tune, in total confusion ... depressingly ordinary ... a 50-minute fizzle\", was how Melody Maker's David Fricke reviewed their contribution at the time. Even spit-shined for CD release, it's an efficient rather than impassioned performance, the usual light-and-shade and hit-and-miss of a Clash gig sacrificed for an immediate but uniform hard-rock sound. (Even the reggae and funk bits are hard rock.) </p> <p>All Sony BMG has to offer by way of competition with existing free internet downloads of this and other Clash shows is improved sound and professional packaging. The first part they've achieved, but the 32-page photo-booklet is exclusive to the deluxe limited edition, and for some reason the front cover of both versions seem to depict the Village People trying to stare down the Viet Cong. There had been a rumour of an accompanying DVD, but it hasn't materialised.</p> <p>Attempts to discuss this glut of unnecesasary product with Sony BMG come to nothing because, as the Clash's publicist explains, \"The guy responsible for catalogue releases is away on holiday.\" </p> <p>Don Letts, however, does answer a few questions. He says there's no DVD in the Shea package because the only surviving live footage from Shea has already been released at least twice, most recently on Revolution Rock ... which, incidentally, contains the entire sum of the live film Sony BMG owns or can lease the rights to. Also, and contrary to suggestions on the official Clash site about a rolling programme of live CDs, \"There are no plans to release any other live albums.\"</p> <p>Is the barrel finally scraped clean, then? Hardly. Still to come, no doubt: the Clash-era Strummer notebooks; Rat Patrol from Fort Bragg (the original double album-length version of 1982's Combat Rock); and, possibly, the half-dozen unreleased songs that - according to Strummer biographer Chris Salewicz - Strummer and Jones wrote together a year or so before the former's death. Any demos? Scour the outhouses! </p> <p>\u2022 Marcus Gray is the author of The Clash: Return of the Last Gang in Town.</p>",
  "<h2>Belgium</h2> <p><strong>Likelihood of total government bail-out:</strong> 4/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>105<br>Two of its five biggest banks - Fortis and Dexia - were bailed out this week by the government and the Dutch, French and Luxembourg authorities. Fortis, a Belgo-Dutch institution, won a \u20ac11.2bn capital injection while Dexia, a Franco-Belgian municipal lender, got \u20ac6.4bn. Thanks to consumer protection laws, Belgian consumer credit, including mortgages, is just 5% of GDP compared with 17% in the UK. The three other big banks - part-Dutch ING, part-French Axa and mainly Flemish KBC - have so far escaped contagion but the authorities have pledged equity support. </p> <h2>France</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>2/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>747<br>French banks are closely regulated by the Banque de France, which boasts that its system is one of the strongest in the world. However, this week France helped rescue Dexia (see Belgium). French banks are much more cautious on lending to consumers than the UK. There is no mortgage equity withdrawal in France, for example, and conditions for getting a mortgage are much stricter. Deposits of at least 10-20% are mandatory and monthly mortgage repayments cannot exceed 33% of monthly income. Latest figures show around 30% of households carrying mortgage debt and 24% using overdraft facilities. </p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>2.5/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>1,650<br>Hypo Real Estate mortgage bank, Germany's second biggest commercial property lender, was bailed out by the government this week to the tune of \u20ac26bn. This followed the rescue of state-owned Sachsen LB and the IKB Deutsche Industrie Bank AG. WestLB has also been driven to the brink of insolvency. The government has tried to reassure the public, but trust in banks is at an all-time low. The ruling coalition is talking of raising the deposit guarantee limit from \u20ac20,000 to \u20ac50,000 or \u20ac70,000 and increasing payout speed. Banks are very cautious lenders and it is not unknown for them to try to put customers off taking out mortgages. There is also a German wariness of credit.</p> <h2>Italy</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>5/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>800<br>Shares in Unicredit, Italy's biggest bank by assets, plunged this week to a 10-year low of \u20ac2.55 amid market panic, leading prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to promise that Italians \"are not going to lose any money\". The Italian financial system is thought to be safe partly because of strict regulation, but also because it is so fragmented, insular and conservative. Though 83% of Italian homes are owner-occupied, it is almost impossible to get a mortgage for more than 60% of the value of a house.</p> <h2>Spain</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>1/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>350<br>Spain looked like being one of the countries worst hit by the financial crisis as a large housing bubble burst last year and the loans ratcheted up by families began to look alarming. Strict rules imposed by the Bank of Spain, however, mean that banks have proved to be less exposed than those elsewhere in Europe. As far back as in 1999, Spain's central bank began to insist that banks boost reserves to write off bad loans. They were told to set aside the money when loans were taken out, rather than waiting until something went wrong with them. Banco Santander, as a result, has been able to snap up bargains like the Bradford &amp; Bingley's deposits and branches.</p> <h2>Denmark</h2> <p><strong>Bailout rating: </strong>3/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>143<br>Denmark has seen several banks bought up by other lenders or rescued by the authorities. On Monday, Vestjysk Bank, the country's seventh largest, announced it would buy smaller peers Ringkjobing and Bonusbanken. In August the Danish central bank had to rescue Roskilde Bank with a \u00a3473m plan amid concern it would collapse under bad mortgage debts. Many banks prefer to grant credit rather than overdrafts. At Danske Bank, for instance, a 35-year-old earning \u00a340,000 per year would receive a \u00a35,500 credit at a 9.1% interest rate. For mortgages, customers tend to receive three times their salaries. </p> <h2>Sweden</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>1/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>94<br>The Swedes have so far been spared by the financial turmoil, thanks in part to the full-scale bail-out that saved its system in the 1990s. However, the central bank said yesterday it would establish a loan facility of 60bn kronor (\u00a34.8bn) to banks to ease the shortage of long-term credit. Lending is more strictly controlled than in the UK and homeowners tend to be able to borrow just 75% of the value of a property.</p> <h2>Switzerland</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>1/5<br><strong>Number of banks: </strong>330<br>The banking sector employs around 135,000 people and is very strictly regulated by the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC). About a third of offshore funds are held in Swiss accounts which are subject to the notorious secrecy provisions of a 1934 law originally drafted to protect German Jews. The big two banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, were among the first European casualties of the sub-prime crisis, with UBS suffering $43bn of writedowns on toxic assets. Under severe new provisions set by the SFBC and on their own initiative, they have been forced to recapitalise.</p> <h2>Ireland</h2> <p><strong>Bail-out rating: </strong>5/5<br><strong>Number of major banks: </strong>14<br>The Irish authorities this week guaranteed deposits and debts in the country's six major banks in a package worth \u20ac400bn. The surprise move came amid reports that one of the banks was about to go bust thanks to bad loans in the country's plunging property market. Ulster Bank was later added to the list after its owner, Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland, complained that its exclusion put it at a commercial disadvantage. Ireland's high deposit per head of \u20ac140,000 is partly explained by the large number of deposits held in the UK by customers of Irish banks.</p>",
  "<p>A ministerial press conference in the middle of a trade fair from which politics are vetoed? Like so much that he has said down the years, Tony Benn's comment describing the Labour party conference in G2 yesterday contains just enough truth to be plausible to the unwary, while simultaneously oversimplifying a process for which he himself bears no small historic responsibility.</p> <p>Yet Benn is on to something all the same. Having spent five of the past six weeks at party political conventions and conferences on either side of the Atlantic, I believe it is obvious democratic politics deserves better than this annual ritual and that something needs to be done about British party conferences.</p> <p>Let us, though, recognise a few realities that Benn ignores. There never was a golden age of party conferences. They evolved because they could not survive as they were. Labour conference was never the people's parliament that rose-tinted memory suggests. A lot of the time they were stitch-up sessions in which male union chiefs traded millions of unconsulted votes to obtain ends which were as often conservative as progressive, and which routinely ignored the interests and views of Labour members, voters and governments alike.</p> <p>Tory conferences of earlier times were unreformed anachronisms too, albeit of a different kind. Too often nasty, deferential and short, they never pretended to be democratic or deliberative, much less representative. They were rallies of the faithful, the fanatical and their wives. MPs of a delicate disposition gave these conferences a wide berth, while ministers arrived, spoke and departed as quickly as possible. Not even the leader always attended. </p> <p>Old-style Liberal assemblies, by contrast, the last of which took place 20 years ago in a snowy January in an icy and forbidding Blackpool hotel, improbably chaired by the brother of the composer of Salad Days, had all the opposing faults: excessive length, openness and encyclopaedic attention to detail, fatally combined with irrelevance.</p> <p>Nor is it true that today's conferences are as completely gelded as fashionable commentary sometimes pretends. Labour conferences still vote, though without the existential drama of yesteryear, and Labour, for all its many controlling sins, remains the one party at which floor delegates can still catch the eye of the chair and get to make an unvetted speech from the platform. You have to be called by name at the Lib Dem conference to do that these days. The Tories, meanwhile, have gone still further down the controlling road. Not only do they never vote; they don't even have a rostrum any more. William Hague and Edwina Currie could not make their names there today.</p> <p>Yet politics at conferences continues. Benn is silly to pretend that a form of politics he dislikes is somehow not politics at all. You couldn't sit through the Lib Dem debate on tax and spend at Bournemouth without understanding what was at stake. Nor listen to Gordon Brown's speech in Manchester - or David Miliband's - without recognising these as conference moments of a kind that Nye Bevan or Hugh Gaitskell would have understood. Even David Cameron's three speeches in Birmingham told a tale of anxiety and indecision for those who were prepared to see it.</p> <p>The fringes remain genuinely important too. Admittedly, there has not been a fringe meeting these 20 years to compare with the Tribune rally in Brighton in 1981, my first Labour conference as a reporter, when Margaret Beckett denounced Neil Kinnock as a Judas for not voting for Benn as deputy leader. And you rarely hear speeches at a Tory fringe like the encoded dissidence that Michael Heseltine or Geoffrey Howe used to bring so compellingly to the seaside in the Thatcher years.</p> <p>Yet if you wanted to understand the seriousness with which the Tory party of 2008 is now preparing for power, then the on-message fringe meetings at this week's Birmingham conference told you a lot. The Labour fringe at Manchester, just as tellingly, offered a fringe conference of the Labour heart running in parallel to the conference of the Labour head in the official hall. </p> <p>Yet party conferences, even in their modern, disciplined, best-behaviour mode, still matter. In 2005, the Tory party conference killed David Davis's leadership hopes dead, and transformed Cameron into the likely winner. That was also the year when a shout from Walter Wolfgang in the gallery during a speech by Jack Straw became the lightning rod for New Labour's illiberalism. Last year, the contrast between Brown's boasting and Cameron's straightforwardness turned the party battle on its head in the Tories' favour. </p> <p>Party conferences have changed for three main reasons. The first is that they reflect changes in society itself. Greater prosperity has fostered greater ideological convergence. The antagonisms of even a generation ago, let alone of a century ago, have been blurred and blunted. Those who want to revive them have been marginalised not by a conspiracy but by progress. The conferences have become more centrist and more convergent, just like the voters.</p> <p>The second change was television. Though the broadcasters no longer pay as much attention to the annual gatherings - not least because in the 24/7 media world the politicians are all permanently available anyway - they have relentlessly dictated changes in political style and appearance to fit the TV era. The pressure to avoid open dissent on TV cannot be laughed off as mere control-freakery.</p> <p>The third change is money. Political parties cannot pay for conferences without the rental income they get from selling space at the conference site to lobbyists and companies, and without sponsorship that only large donors can provide. Judging by the Tory conference this week, I bet the party made a profit.</p> <p>That is why, if you want to change conferences for the better - not to take them back to some non-existent and irrecoverable golden era but to make them more open and honest about the discussion of political and policy options, and less dominated by money and lobbyists - then money is the only weapon available. State funding of political parties should be your goal.</p> <p>If you want parties under an obligation to conduct their conferences with more open debates and under other democratic rules, then place conditions on the state funding that they crave. Anything else is crying for the moon.<br><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\"><br>martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The fire started in the extractor system at 7.30 on a Saturday night in April, just as the River Cafe was starting to fill up with customers. By the time the fire was put out, the kitchen was chargrilled and the dining room blackened with smoke. Neither Ruth Rogers nor Rose Gray were in the country. Rogers was on a plane to New York, going to visit her first grandchild; Gray was in St Tropez. \"I was sitting having my third fabulous cocktail and my mobile kept ringing and I was ignoring it,\" says Gray. \"In the end I picked it up and saw a text saying: 'Rose, ring the restaurant, it's on fire.' I got on a plane the following morning, walked into the restaurant and burst into tears. The main thing was, everything was black. We had such a beautiful restaurant - shiny and colourful - but it was the black that I couldn't cope with.\" </p> <p>Six months later, the fresh scent of paint hangs in the air and shards of sunlight flood in through the huge glass windows. They haven't just repaired the fire damage - \"That could have been done in a matter of weeks if we'd wanted to,\" says Rogers - they have built a new bar and a private dining room, and the new kitchen is open to the main restaurant. There is activity everywhere - carpenters run their hands over cabinets to check they are flush, a young woman sits at the bar carefully cutting out cloakroom tickets, fridges are being filled and gleaming metal surfaces polished. </p> <p>The closure of a London restaurant for the summer wouldn't usually cause much of a fuss, but the River Cafe isn't any old restaurant. It is one of the most influential in the UK, and its owner-chefs, with their lifelong love of rustic Italian cookery, played no small part in introducing the nation to sun-dried tomatoes, polenta and olive oil. Not bad for a couple of women who were busy bringing up children, and who had never trained as professional chefs when they started the River Cafe 21 years ago (initially as a work canteen for Ruth's husband, Richard Rogers, and his architecture firm next door). They sell their cookery books by the million and have trained some of today's best-known cooks, including Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, both of whom have gone on to espouse the importance of quality, seasonal ingredients - the cornerstone of the River Cafe from the beginning. </p> <p>\"I know it's become very fashionable now,\" says Gray, \"but to us, it just made sense. It is cheaper and it tastes better when things are in season. And you can get excited about new things coming in. When summer is ending, you know you've got autumn to look forward to.\" </p> <p>I was going to ask if perhaps the fire and the closure of their west London restaurant might have made them consider retiring (Rogers and Gray are in their mid-50s and 60s respectively) but watching them in the middle of their dining room, looking more energetic than their youthful staff, I realise it is a stupid question. (Later, I ask Gray, who has twice had breast cancer, if she might slow down, and she says, \"I wouldn't know what to do - I would probably dissolve.\") They are like a married couple and I have to admit it is almost impossible to interview them; they talk over each other, finish each other's sentences, admonish each other when they don't agree, and laugh together. </p> <p>The insurance meant that all their staff could be paid while the restaurant was closed. \"They didn't all go, 'Oh, wonderful, a paid holiday,'\" says Rogers. \"They passionately wanted to work, and they were really lost at sea, their anchor had been taken away. We decided that the most important thing was to use the time wisely, to come back and do it better.\" It says a lot about how respected Gray and Rogers are in the restaurant world that immediately after the fire, their suppliers and other restaurateurs were on the phone, offering help, and the pair decided that their staff should be given the opportunity to soak up other people's knowledge. \"So they went to the butcher and learned about the meat,\" says Gray, her words coming out in a tumble. \"They all went to La Fromagerie, the cheese shop, to learn how to look after cheeses - how to turn cheeses, to wash the rind, to move them, the temperature you need to keep them at - because now we've got a cheese room in the new restaurant. It's so exciting. Some of them went out with our fish suppliers on the coast, caught fish and watched how they sent fish to market. Then they went up to stay with one of the producers of the animals and went to their abattoirs and saw how they worked.\" They went to Specogna, a family-run wine producer in northern Italy, and several other vineyards. Before she can draw breath, Gray has moved seamlessly from wine to prosciutto (the pair of them could talk about food and drink all day). \"The prosciutto from San Daniele [north-east Italy] is made with pigs that have a very different diet from the pigs in Parma. They eat acorns. Prosciutto di Parma pigs' diet is the byproduct of parmesan, which is basically milk, whey, bits of old cheese rind and everything else. So it's very different. Some of the chefs have now got knowledge that Ruthie and I don't have.\" \"Like how to cut a prosciutto,\" says Rogers. \"They came back and said, 'Don't ever put anything with prosciutto. They just serve prosciutto with nothing, no figs, no melon.'\" </p> <p>Jo Holland has been a chef at the River Cafe for seven years. She went to San Daniele - \"It's amazing to meet the producers. I now only want to have this particular prosciutto, because it's an amazing product and I love the passion and the history of this family who make it\" - and to Poole to fish with the restaurant's fishermen. \"That was incredible,\" she says. \"I've had a telephone relationship with them for years, but it means so much more to meet them and go out on the boat with them and see where the fish come from. You just feel you understand your ingredients in more detail and depth.\"</p> <p>Gray and Rogers both have a strong sense of social justice (Rogers, especially, is enviably well-connected and there are numerous River Cafe charitable events), but for all their leftwing ideas and egalitarianism, the restaurant is still beyond the means of ordinary people (main courses are upwards of \u00a328). They seem used to hearing this. \"We like to buy the best, because the River Cafe is about ingredients and it always has been,\" says Gray. \"We consider ourselves fair and very conscientious that people get value for money.\" She looks to Rogers, who says: \"Rose and I are very concerned about all that and we reflect it in the way we run our business. We pay our staff fairly - I don't think you'll find any other restaurant that gives as long a maternity leave as we do and we insist on chefs having two days off in a row. So there's all that, a civility in the way we run our business and our ethos runs throughout that.\" </p> <p>She admits that \"running an expensive Italian restaurant is not the most socially significant thing [you can do]\", so while they were shut, they embarked on a series of charitable events. The dining room, with its wall of glass, was turned into a giant greenhouse where Rogers and Gray grew tomatoes, zucchini, beans, pumpkins. \"We wanted to help this school for children with learning disabilities, and we decided to build a vegetable garden for the children,\" says Gray. \"We got them to dig the garden and we took about six chefs and we all planted it together. Then we cooked for them and the kids helped. That was an amazing day.\" The pair also took their female chefs (who outnumber the male chefs in the River Cafe) and cooked at a women's refuge. \"And we took four chefs and went to a group called Women for Refugee Women,\" says Rogers. \"There were about eight women from all different countries, mostly African ones, who are here with their children living in hostels. We all cooked together and it was really moving, because not many of these women had had a meal cooked for them ever in their lives. They had always been the providers. It was very gratifying to do that.\" </p> <p>It feels as if the country has changed a lot even in the months while the River Cafe has been shut. Its image was once so intertwined with New Labour (Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown and the Blairs were all regular customers) that at the Tory conference the year after Labour's landslide victory, the Conservative MP Peter Lilley complained that Britain was \"now all about Britpop and The River Cafe\". Those years - the optimism, the money, the New Labour sheen - feel long gone. With the current economic problems, there probably isn't a more difficult time to be relaunching a restaurant, even one that, when it opens on Monday, is already fully booked for the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>\"It is very worrying,\" admits Rogers. \"But we have to do what we do, like everybody else in this situation. I always say if you're on the in-list one year, you'll be on the out-list the next. We do what we do, and we've done the River Cafe for us and our customers. We're not thinking, 'We have to be in fashion.' Fashion doesn't really interest us.\" </p> <p>There's no more time to talk. There are boxes to unpack, glasses to polish, menus to prepare. Rogers goes off to supervise something and I ask Gray if she's nervous. \"Cooking under pressure is probably a bit like riding a bike,\" she says. \"You don't forget how to do it. You suddenly kick into it and then you're off\".</p>",
  "<p>If tragedy is the downfall of an essentially good person through some fatal choice or action, then Sir Ian Blair's descent probably began shortly before the first British suicide bombers brought death and carnage to the country three years ago.</p> <p>He was five months into his new job, a post he acknowledged required \"copper-bottomed trousers\", and was appearing on the Today programme when he boasted about the Metropolitan police's record on combating terrorism. The force, he said, was the \"gold standard\" across the world for dealing with terrorism and had \"upped\" its game to work more closely with the intelligence services than anywhere in the western world. It was 7.16am. </p> <p>Ninety minutes later the first of three suicide bombs exploded on London underground trains within 50 seconds of each other. Nearly an hour later a fourth bomber detonated his device on a bus. </p> <p>If Blair did not immediately regret that moment of hubris, he must have done later. His comments were seen by his foes as an early sign of a lack of judgment - and luck - that pervaded his tenure at the Metropolitan police. Unlike the heroes of Greek tragedy, Blair elicits little sympathy from anyone in Scotland Yard today. </p> <p>It is a remarkable collapse in support for a man many hoped would rejuvenate a force which less than 10 years ago was branded institutionally racist.</p> <p>\"Blair has lost his friends and supporters,\" said one former close colleague. \"Those who were not close to him but put prejudice to one side and said; 'I have to stand by him,' have been put through such difficult times their support has waned. </p> <p>\"Those who consider themselves to be friends of his, equally, have been shafted or not treated well and were also starting to question what his motives are.\"</p> <p>Another close associate drew parallels with the troubled tenure of another former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon.</p> <p>\"It's like the dying days of Condon, nothing was going to improve until Blair went. Only at least in Condon we had a statesman-like figure. Blair seemed to be too touchy and not big enough to let certain things just wash over him.\"</p> <p>Blair's reign began in February 2005. The former deputy commissioner, he succeeded Sir John Stevens and immediately faced extreme challenges: Islamist suicide bombers, the fatal shooting of an innocent man in a bungled anti-terror operation, a simmering race row with senior officers and a violent youth crime problem. </p> <p>But arguably the events he had to deal with were no more challenging than those faced by commissioners from Sir Robert Mark in 1972 to Stevens; Irish republican terrorism, police corruption, the Broadwater farm riots and the murder of PC Keith Blakelock, the poll tax riots and the fatal stabbing of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>Coming as he did after the towering figure of Stevens - the larger than life commissioner who held the loyalty of the rank and file - Blair was a completely different kind of leader. </p> <p><strong>Stubborn</strong></p> <p>Early on, Blair earned the reputation for being a New Labour lackey. Lobbying first for identity cards and later for detention for 42 days without trial, he was accused of being a mouthpiece for his namesake, the then prime minister, Tony Blair.</p> <p>It was always acknowledged that he was a clever politician, able to win over ministers, but support from the rank and file was going to be harder to secure after Stevens' superhero status. \"If Stevens had to give you bad news he would put his arm round your shoulders and include you and by the end of it you would agree with his decision to move you or take officers away from your unit,\" one officer said. \"But with Blair there is no small talk. When he calls you in to see you he just starts talking. When he is finished he gets up from his desk and it's time for you to go.\"</p> <p>Another associate said: \"His interpersonal skills are not good. He thinks he is good at it, but actually he is not.\"</p> <p>One anecdote notorious at the Yard describes the evening Blair took a handful of senior officers to dinner to congratulate them. Some of those present recalled that he made it clear as soon as they sat down that he would only be eating a main course, so they followed his lead. </p> <p>After the main course he asked; \"Who's for coffee?\" bringing a swift end to the proceedings. When it came to the bill, Blair took the receipt, divided it up and asked them all to pay \u00a321 each. He then returned to the table carrying a handful of one pound coins, and returned \u00a32 each to the officers because the service had not been inspiring enough to leave a tip.</p> <p>All of that might not have mattered had his officers believed he was either an inspirational leader or someone they should fear. But Blair quickly gained a reputation for a lack of general judgment and stubbornness.</p> <p>Senior officers complained that he didn't listen, and that he became paralysed as problems piled up. The shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell tube on July 22 2005 would have presented a challenge for any commissioner: an innocent man gunned down in an anti-terrorist operation bungled and confused from the start. Quite naturally in the immediate aftermath there was a degree of chaos and crisis management at the Yard. Confirmed facts were scant, the media was baying for information and there were still at least three suicide bombers on the run.</p> <p>At a press conference that afternoon Blair said: \"The information I have available is that this shooting is directly linked to the ongoing and expanding anti-terrorist operation. Any death is deeply regrettable I understand the man was challenged and refused to obey.\"</p> <p>None of this was confirmed at the time, and although Blair was perhaps let down by senior officers who did not brief him clearly, he also had the option of using his own judgment. The next day Blair continued talking, leading a senior officer to tell the Guardian: \"It is time for him to just be quiet. If you don't know the full facts, don't make out that you do.\"</p> <p>But Blair's tendency to say the wrong thing continued. In January 2006, he claimed \"almost nobody\" could understand why the murder of the two ten-year-olds, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham in 2002 dominated the news headlines and became \"the biggest story in Britain\", provoking a furious response and eliciting an apology. </p> <p>Two months later, it emerged that he had illicitly recorded telephone conversations with several public figures, including Lord Goldsmith, the then attorney general, and senior figures within the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). </p> <p><strong>Blunders</strong></p> <p>He was also ridiculed for suggesting during a visit to Haringey, in north London, that crime had come down so much that people were leaving their doors open or unlocked, in a way they had not done for 25 years. The figures suggested otherwise: in one year 2,834 burglaries were reported to police in the borough.</p> <p>On another occasion at a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority, Blair told those attending that vehicle-borne bombs were the greatest threat to the capital. Moments later his comments were undermined by a senior figure, who told journalists privately: \"The intelligence does not stand that up.\"</p> <p>There were other embarrassing moments. In a Guardian interview in 2006 Blair spoke of his experience as a young officer during the 1975 Balcombe Street siege in London, when an IRA unit was chased to a house. He indicated that he had been fired at by the IRA. But a fellow officer questioned that version of events. </p> <p>Judgment was again crucial in the fallout from the De Menezes shooting. Blair was heavily criticised by the IPCC for blocking its inquiry into the shooting for three days. The delays, the IPCC said, had given officers time to alter a surveillance log and allow conspiracy theories to develop about the shooting.</p> <p>When it came to the criminal prosecution of the Met over the shooting, under health and safety laws, Blair, sources say, again displayed lack of a sure touch. </p> <p>\"He was advised by several senior officers, people close to him, to plead guilty, take the beating and move on. But he insisted that we must plead not guilty in the face of opposition from all around him,\" said a senior figure.</p> <p>The Met's defence team mounted a brutal character assassination at the trial, suggesting De Menezes might have been high on cocaine and therefore jumpy and paranoid, that he had acted like a suicide bomber, and had been aggressive and threatening.</p> <p>In addition, the Met released a composite picture intending to show how alike de Menezes was to the suicide bomber Hussain Osman. But it emerged that the picture had been distorted, stretched or resized, creating a misleading match. The Met was convicted of endangering the public and Mr Justice Henriques criticised Blair's force for adopting \"an entrenched position\" in refusing to admit any failures in the operation.</p> <p>\"The thing about Blair is that for most of his career he has been a lot brighter than those around him and he has got into the habit of not listening. But he is now at a level where he should be taking advice,\" said one adviser.</p> <p>Blair's integrity was in the end fatally damaged by the controversy over the awarding of \u00a33m of Met contracts to Andy Miller, a friend and skiing companion. A report by the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, was due to be delivered before the end of 2008 and was expected to be highly critical of Blair. </p> <p>\"At the end of the day the crucial thing on the main contract was that he was in the room when it was awarded to his best friend, and he shouldn't have been, he should have declared an interest and left. It's extraordinary he could not see that,\" said a senior officer.</p> <p><strong>Crime</strong></p> <p>Throughout it all, however, Blair continued to receive the private support of successive home secretaries as crime continued to fall. But in some areas spikes in offences were marked. Youth crime, particularly fatal knifings and shootings, has increased year on year during Blair's tenure and the victims are predominantly black men in their early to mid teens. </p> <p>It is an unedifying context against which to view the race row simmering all summer between Blair and senior Asian officers who accuse him of discrimination.</p> <p>As he departs, Blair might take some comfort from recent emails received from ordinary black and ethnic minority officers, telling him they do not agree with the views of the National Black Police Association and are happy in their lot. </p> <p>\"The great irony is that Blair was the most liberal leader we have had,\" one ethnic minority officer said. \"But in the end he wasted that, he was vulnerable and weak and exercised no control over those below him.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> March 19 1953, in Chester</p> <p><strong>Educated</strong> Read English at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1971 and wanted to be an actor.

  "<p>Sir Ian Blair was forced to resign as Britain's top police officer in a Tory coup engineered by Boris Johnson, who insisted no permanent successor needed to be appointed until the Conservatives took over in Downing Street, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>In a dramatic showdown between the two, the mayor of London made it clear that Blair had to quit his post as Metropolitan police commissioner. Friends of Blair said last night that when the commissioner suggested he should stay until a replacement had been found, he was told: \"We don't want a successor appointed. We will have an acting arrangement until a Conservative home secretary arrives.\"</p> <p>Johnson's attempt to put himself above the law and appoint the next commissioner was immediately challenged by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, who has been left privately seething by the mayor's flexing of muscles. By statute only the home secretary can appoint and dismiss a Met police commissioner. \"There's a process in place that the mayor chose not to respect,\" Smith said last night.</p> <p>The government's anger was directed at the way Johnson treated Blair's future as though the issue was purely a matter for London, rather than one affecting the policing and counter-terrorism policy of the UK as a whole, Whitehall sources said. \"The Metropolitan police commissioner does not just look after London but in counter-terrorism terms looks after the whole country and the leadership of the police,\" said a well-placed official. He added: \"Yet London has decided this.\"</p> <p>The point was reflected in Smith's letter to Johnson yesterday. \"The office of commissioner is an indispensable part of the good policing of London,\" she said, adding pointedly \"and of maintaining the national security of the country as a whole.\"</p> <p>The tone of her letter to Blair, in contrast, was significantly warmer and included an indirect attack on Johnson, implying that he had been irresponsible in effectively forcing the commissioner to resign.</p> <p>\"You have faced the complex challenges of your office with unwavering commitment,\" Smith told Blair. \"It is the job of responsible politicians to support those who have to carry heavy operational burdens. It has been my honour to do so.\"</p> <p>Details of the face-to-face confrontation between Blair and Johnson, who was supported by his chief of staff, Kit Malthouse, were revealed to the Guardian last night.</p> <p>\"It is a very black day for the constitutional position around policing,\" said a Whitehall source. \"We have a mayor who is saying he wants a change of leadership in the Met, but ... that is not the way it should happen.\"</p> <p>Friends of Blair said he had no choice but to quit, even though the mayor of London had no statutory power to sack him. \"He could have stayed on. He could have said 'sod it', but only at the cost of total damage to his organisation. It would have been structurally impossible,\" said one.</p> <p>Johnson made his move on Wednesday within hours of taking control of the Metropolitan Police Authority, calling Blair into a private meeting at City Hall. He did not wait for the outcome of three big challenges to Blair's leadership; the inquest into the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, a race discrimination case from assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur and an inquiry by HM chief inspector of constabulary into \u00a33m of Met contracts awarded to Blair's best friend.</p> <p>But Blair, who has refused to quit over these issues in the past, said yesterday at a press conference that they were not the reason for his departure 16 months before his contract is due to expire. \"I am resigning not because of any failures by my service and not because the pressures of the office and the many stories that surround it are too much,\" he said. \"I would have wished to continue to serve Londoners until my time of office expired in February 2010. However ... the new mayor made clear, in a very pleasant but determined way, that he wished there to be a change of leadership at the Met ...</p> <p>\"To serve effectively the commissioner must have the confidence of both the mayor and the home secretary. Without the mayor's backing, I do not consider that I can continue in the job.\"</p> <p>After the home secretary's intervention, Blair stays in post until December 1.</p> <p>Publicly, Johnson praised Blair for his service, giving no hint of the bitter confrontation the two men had in private. But he said: \"There comes a time in any organisation when it becomes clear it would benefit from new leadership and clarity of purpose. I believe that time is now.</p> <p>\"And following a meeting with Sir Ian yesterday, he has agreed to give someone else the chance to offer new leadership for policing in London. And I am sure he has done the right thing. I will always be grateful to Sir Ian for the productive start he has made to our plans to tackle serious violence and to reduce disorder on public transport. He leaves having made London safer and with our gratitude and best wishes.\"</p> <p>The Tories have repeatedly called for Blair to stand down after the Met was found guilty last year of serious failures that led to the death of de Menezes.</p> <p>The home secretary said in a statement that she accepted Sir Ian's decision to quit \"with regret\". \"Sir Ian has always had my support for the demanding and vital tasks that we expect of the Met,\" she said. She added: \"Sir Ian can be proud of his contribution locally and nationally.\"</p> <p>But her shadow, Dominic Grieve, accused the government of showing a \"serious lack of judgment\" about the leadership of the Met. He said: \"This is the right decision.\"</p>",
  "<p>The time has come... <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">Guardian.co.uk/film</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/filmandmusic\">Film &amp; Music</a> have got together to inaugurate the Guardian First Film award, in which we are asking you, along with our critics, to nominate and vote on the best debut works from the last year. Here's the place to get your thinking caps on about the directorial debut you've most admired over the last 12 months.</p> <p>So what qualifies for the award? The film must be a feature-length fiction (documentaries don't count), have been given an official UK cinema release between October 1 2007 and September 30 2008 (if it's just had film festival screenings it won't qualify), and the director must be making their first feature. For example, Son of Rambow doesn't qualify, even though it's the director Garth Jennings' solo debut, as he already made Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as part of the Hammer &amp; Tongs partnership. Other than that, it's wide open.</p> <p>We've done <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/02/guardian.first.film\">a preliminary survey</a>, and it seems there are more than 110 films to choose from. Our list isn't definitive, so if there's something else you think ought to be there, by all means email in and make a case. But a quick glance shows some obvious contenders. From the British contingent, Anton Corbijn's much-praised Joy Division biopic <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=7c2_B_cWK_M\">Control</a> has got to be a strong candidate, along with Sarah Gavron's adaptation of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=6iyo8jPOzYY\">Brick Lane </a> and Joanna Hogg's critically acclaimed <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=8NecAfUh4ys\">Unrelated</a>. Martin McDonagh's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=7mR-sIf-w1w\">In Bruges</a> also impressed.</p> <p>But there's plenty of classy stuff from the rest of the world. Eran Kolirin's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=QWYlLb0jm8U\">The Band's Visit</a> has won lots of admirers for its subtle depiction of Israeli-Arab relationships. Sarah Polley, the young American actor, stunned audiences with her adaptation of Alice Munro's story about Alzheimer's, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=ct7eXP-ivAk\">Away From Her</a>. Juan Antonio Bayona showed there's more from the Guillermo del Toro stable with his spooky <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=UqqcBkpmsSA\">The Orphanage</a>. And only last week, Philippe Claudel's <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=AlMPS_qcRaM\">I've Loved You So Long</a> saw him emerge as a strong contender.</p> <p>Any of them would be a worthy winner. But we want to know what you think. Which films do you want to see win, and why - tell us here. But you need to email your nominations to <a href=\"mailto:first.film@theguardian.com\">first.film@theguardian.com</a> otherwise they won't count. (Feel free to put in some supporting lines of text.) Our critics will then whittle down the nominations to a shortlist of 10, announced on October 31. We'll then invite you to vote for the winner, with voting closing at the end of November. Your votes will count for half the total, and our critics' votes will count for the other half. We're doing it this way not because we're not interested in your opinions, but because e-votes can be hijacked by organised lobbies. The winner will be announced on December 19.</p> <p>So, who will you be nominating?</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign for the White House is receiving increasing complaints about scam pollsters involved in dirty tricks operations to discredit the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Victims claim the fake pollsters work insinuations into their questions, designed to damage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Obama</a>. Those targeted in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/22/uselections2008.republicans\">swing states</a> such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania include Jews, Christian evangelicals, Catholics and Latinos.</p> <p>One of those to protest, Debbie Minden, who lives in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood, Squirrel Hill, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that the pollster had begun by asking her the usual questions about her background and who she would vote for.</p> <p>But the pollster went on to ask Minden, who is Jewish, how she would vote if she knew that Obama was supported by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza and was responsible for most of the suicide bombings against Israel. \"It is scare tactics. It is terribly underhand,\" she said.</p> <p>The groups behind such polls have not been identified. One of the Republican groups working on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s campaign, the Republican Jewish Coalition, acknowledges carrying out a survey about Jewish voters' views on Obama and Israel, but insists it was a legitimate exercise intended to test campaign messages on Jewish voters.</p> <p>The RJC angrily dismissed comparisons between its exercise and a \"push poll\", the technique of using fake surveys to sway voters. Its poll was restricted to 750 people whereas push polls usually involve phoning thousands of people. It asked 82 questions, only 10% of which were devoted to Obama.</p> <p>The technique of push polling is part of the election battle being fought on the ground in the swing states where the margins of victory have been narrow in past elections.</p> <p>On a bigger scale, teams from each campaign are engaged in legal fights over who is entitled to vote, with Republican groups trying to have people in largely Democratic neighbourhoods disqualified.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/19/uselections2000.usa2\">Push polling </a>was used with stunning effect in the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina where people claiming to be pollsters insinuated that McCain, then fighting George Bush for the party nomination, had illegitimately fathered a black child.</p> <p>Bush went on to overturn McCain's double-digit poll lead in the primaries, and the origin of the calls was never fully established.</p> <p>This year, the tactic surfaced again during the Republican primaries when calls were made highlighting the religion of one of the candidates, Mitt Romney - he is a Mormon, a religion viewed with suspicion by some on the Christian right.</p> <p>An Obama campaign organiser in one of the swing states said there had been lots of complaints about push polling in his patch. Callers said questions frequently included a reference to the widespread belief that Obama is a Muslim, even though he has repeatedly said he is a Christian.</p> <p>The organiser said another question was: would you be less likely to vote for Obama if Israel had to give up all of Jerusalem? \"They make this shit up. They are good at it. The unassuming listener will not realise it is untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>Minden, a school psychologist, received a call on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of last month. Living in a swing state, she was not surprised to be polled. \"It sounded like a normal poll. Was I voting? Demographics? Age? Where we live? Then a question about which party I supported, who I preferred on the economy, on foreign policy, questions like that.</p> <p>\"They said; 'Are you Jewish?' and I said 'Yeh'. Then they said 'if you knew Barack Obama was supported by Hamas, would it change your vote? Would it change your vote if you knew his church had made antisemitic statements?'. All the hot button issues on Israel.\" She said she will vote for Obama as planned.</p> <p>In Key West, Florida, another swing state, Joelna Marcus, 71, a retired professor, had a similar experience. She was asked if she would be influenced if she learned that Obama had donated money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Marcus has since disconnected her telephone.</p> <p>The Huffington Post website reported that a reader, named Rachel from Strongsville, Ohio, complained of a push poll that portrayed Obama as a radical leftwinger who had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early and to allow them to live near schools.</p>",
  "<p>It's not just Americans who face a crucial choice this autumn. You, too, have the opportunity to effect world-altering change by the simple expedient of casting a vote. We want you to help us choose the best British debut album and the best film by any first-time director (from anywhere in the world) released in the past year. Our awards have no sponsor, so you can be sure no shady money-men are pressuring us to pick a particular album or film in return for kickbacks. Our judging panel consists solely of you and our critics, so there is no risk of celebrity judges nudging us towards their mates' work. Indeed, so free of the shackles of corporate cash are these awards that we don't even have a prize (we might buy cheap trophies for the winners from the shop around the corner). In short, we want to make it all about quality.</p> <p>And so to the rules. It's simple. Throughout October, you have the opportunity to nominate your favourite debut films or albums - just email your nominations to <a href=\"mailto:first.film@theguardian.com\">first.film@theguardian.com</a> or <a href=\"mailto:first.album@theguardian.com\">first.album@theguardian.com</a>. Feel free to include some supporting text arguing why each deserves the award. </p> <p>The film must be a feature-length fiction movie that had a cinematic release in the UK between October 1 2007 and September 30 2008. It must be the first fiction feature from its director, and it can have been made anywhere. </p> <p>As for the album, it must be a genuine debut album by a British artist released between those two dates. \"Genuine debut\" means no side projects - so the Last Shadow Puppets and Neon Neon are not eligible - and no albums made by somone who previously released albums with a different group. There's a little leeway: if your favourite album featured bass-playing by someone who happened to have been on another album three years ago, we can allow that. But if it's a songwriter moving from group to group, that's a no-no. We're trying to recognise new talent here. </p> <p>At the end of October, our critics will look at your nominations and whittle them down to 10 films and 10 albums. If you didn't nominate it, it won't be on the shortlist. And if you overwhelmingly back some works, we will not ignore your feelings. </p> <p>We'll then publish the shortlists and invite you to vote for the winners, with voting closing at the end of November. Your votes will count for half the total, and our critics' votes will count for the other half. We're weighting it that way not because we don't trust you, but because we don't want publicists or organised lobbies to be able to hijack the voting process (be warned: multiple votes from the same or similar email addresses will be viewed with suspicion). The shortlists will be announced in our October 31 edition, and the winners will be unveiled in the last Film&amp;Music of the year, on December 19.</p> <p>So what's in the running? There's a score of films in contention: Control, The Band's Visit, Cloverfield, Lars and the Real Girl, The Orphanage, In Bruges, Persepolis ... Or maybe you preferred the Paris Hilton vehicle, The Hottie and the Nottie. As for albums, there are big commercial contenders from Glasvegas, Adele and Duffy, the math rock of Foals, the cross-stylistic potpourri of Late of the Pier, Mercury-nominated debuts from Laura Marling or Portico Quartet, or urban efforts from the likes of Ear Dis ... The list could go on and on. </p> <p>To read more about some of the films and albums that qualify, and to start persuading others of the virtues of your own preferred candidate, go to our blogs: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/oct/03/1\">theguardian.com/film/filmblog</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog\">theguardian.com/music/musicblog</a></p>",
  "<p>It seemed as if class conflict was a thing of the past in Britain. An old Etonian at the top of the polls; Labour roundly derided for trying to criticise \"toff\" Tory candidates. But the economic crisis of the past few weeks has seen class resentments resurfacing: rich bankers got us into this mess! Why are we bailing them out when no one lifted a finger for the miners? Which means that British society is now aping, of all things, indie music's class warfare. </p> <p>The British indie scene has never been so divided, and the two sides are facing off across a sticky dancefloor over the issue of class. Just ask Coventry Britrockers the Enemy. An interview with singer Tom Clarke last year saw him berating rival bands whose backgrounds he considered to border on the aristocratic. \"I think having working-class roots does mean better songs as they are songs the majority can relate to,\" he told the Sun. \"If you live in a castle, you're going to write about living in a castle and who wants to hear a fucking song about a castle?\"</p> <p>Those supposedly up in the turrets were never going to take that lying down, and so, sure enough, earlier this year Observer Music Monthly ran an article featuring the privately educated Foals, Ox.Eagle.Lion.Man and These New Puritans, proclaiming the arrival of \"a new class of smart, literate British bands challenging the lumbering louts of indie rock\" and deriding bands whose members look like \"plumbers\". This in turn provoked NME features editor James McMahon to fire off an enraged letter to the paper warning that \"the views expressed by the privately educated bands reeked of an inherent fear of the working classes\".</p> <p>Though he admits his words were fuelled by a combination of \"gin and vitriol\", McMahon is adamant that the elitism he claimed to detect reflects a more general prejudice throughout the industry. \"Working-class bands are so often viewed just as oiks or dullards in cagoules, and to me that is a manifestation of a real fear of poor people,\" he says. \"My worry is that music now seems to be something you can't get into any more unless you have financial bedding and are free of the constriction of having to have a job. The indie-pop scene now is just posh people who don't have to get up in the morning to go to work, wandering around London being idiots, not saying anything of any depth or value, and existing in this self-absorbed bubble. There is a massive amount of snobbery.\"</p> <p>McMahon believes this extends to the way record labels approach the marketing of bands seen as working class. \"I remember seeing the Twang at a showcase gig in Camden before they were signed. It was obscene - loads of record company people turning to each other saying, 'Ooh, aren't they scary lads?' and telling horrific stories about how they were football hooligans and that they'd been banned from some bar in Birmingham for groping a girl's breasts. I went for a drink with the band afterwards, and they were surrounded by people almost telling them to perform for the gallery - 'Get this drink down you, go wild, you need to be like the Happy Mondays.' And all they actually talked about was how much they missed their girlfriends on tour. There was none of this 'lads in Magaluf' shit. But the only thing the industry wanted to hook the music on was this fake oik image.\" McMahon is convinced that bands from middle-class backgrounds do not have to deal with preconceptions. \"A middle-class band doesn't have to be anything. There's no glass ceiling. Working-class bands, without a doubt, have to fit into the box that's set up for them.\"</p> <p>The bands themselves are frustrated by this desire to define them so narrowly. \"I do think that the way we're pigeonholed is patronising,\" says Liam Fray of the Courteeners. \"Whether you're from Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow or wherever, the press think, 'Strong accent, lads, they like football; we'll put them in this box.' You know what? I do love Liam Gallagher and Oasis, I love football, and we are lads, but we're not allowed to be anything more than that.\"</p> <p>It's not all the press's fault. Marking out the demographic appeal of a band is integral to the major labels' marketing process. \"It's definitely talked about within the label,\" says one A&amp;R at a major record company. \"If you have a band with that working class lad-rock sound, you will jump to very obvious conclusions about what they're like as people, and also about the people who you think will like it. It informs the whole campaign. With a band like the Enemy or Kasabian, the idea is to get people behind them like they get behind football teams, trying to get them to look up to the band, in a way that is very different from how you'd market Girls Aloud or Foals.\"</p> <p>In fact, contrary to McMahon's belief, predetermined marketing plans dependent on stereotypes apply not only to working-class bands. For an art-rock band such as Foals, solidly middle class both in membership and their perceived appeal, a common marketing tactic is to use a nominally independent feeder label as a means to building up vital credibility. \"Finding an indie to start things off before putting stuff out on the major label is something that happens all the time with bands like that - there are very few true independent labels now, the majority are funded by majors,\" the A&amp;R says. \"You've got to be careful, because you can damage the credibility of your indie label if you force them to put out some crap you've just signed. But it's about putting the band in context for the media and for fans. If you put them out on a certain indie label, it puts them into the context and aesthetic of that label, and leads people to think they must be similar to their other bands. It doesn't even matter what they sound like - it's all just codes and clues as to what you're trying to do.\" Either way, image is everything. \"The media needs to put bands and people into boxes, and it makes it easier for everybody if you've got a strong image - it helps people to understand where you fit, even if that is relying on stereotypes.\" </p> <p>Once an act are stereotyped, they can suffer from it, regardless of their background. Public school-educated George Pringle's experimental spoken-word electro has drawn both critical plaudits and brickbats, but her undiluted middle-class accent has been a frequent point of interest for writers. \"Every critical review I've ever had has included the words 'moaning posh girl',\" she explains. \"I had no idea my voice would end up pissing people off as much as it has. People associate wealth with not having a cause for complaint, that you don't have something to talk about because you come from a privileged background. But you only have to look at someone like Joe Strummer to see how ridiculous that is.\"</p> <p>The spectre of Oasis looms large over any discussion of class and today's indie scene. For the cultural commentator Jon Savage, the Gallaghers' \"class fundamentalism\" delivered a crushing blow to the idea of aspirational working-class music. \"Oasis were so big that they could have done anything they wanted to - they could have done incredible things with their position, but they chose to put themselves in a box and be a malign influence,\" he says. \"There was that famous quote of Noel Gallagher saying that he never reads books. Compare that to the Manic Street Preachers - they came from a South Walian valleys tradition, an old Labour tradition of education and hard work and self improvement, which is a very strong part of working-class history, but something Oasis always rejected. Oasis are a very fundamentalist act, in their attitude to class and their attitude to music. In a way they're very reactionary.\"</p> <p>Savage highlights the social cross-pollination of punk as being a healthier model than today's class divide. \"One of the interesting things about punk was the class mix. That's when things really happen, when people step outside of their allotted class roles - and allotted class roles are just as strong for public-school people as they are for working-class people - and encounter each other and learn from each other. </p> <p>\"I always thought the point about rock music was transformation, about becoming something different, something other, something glamorous, something inspiring, and that means stepping outside your allotted class role if you can. But bands like Oasis or Paul Weller just encouraged a lot of kids just to stay in their roles, and that kind of social realism is very trite and very dull.\"</p> <p>The Manics remain a central reference point for James McMahon, too. Despite his fierce defence of bands such as the Twang, he fears the rigidity of the surface level assumptions used by the industry to market indie music - assumptions too often left unchallenged by the musicians themselves - limit the opportunities for bands willing to try to fight free of what is expected of them. </p> <p>\"I do find it depressing that there hasn't been a working-class band for such a long time who really breaks that mould of dumb lads in cagoules,\" he admits. \"The Manics were the perfect distillation of the high hopes the working classes can achieve through music. They had intelligence and sensuality and beauty, and subverted anything that people might assume about them - but there was also anger and frustration, which I think can only come from people who have had to fight tooth and nail in their formative years to be creative. That's something that just can't come from people who would be in a high-powered City job if they weren't in a band.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's a remarkable scene in Matteo Garrone's film Gomorrah, in which a man known to us as Uncle Franco, immaculate in his linen suit, is overseeing the dumping of several hundred barrels of toxic waste. During the manoeuvre, one of the truck drivers, an illegal immigrant, gets splashed with corrosive fluid from a container, and the others down tools. Uncle Franco drives off and returns not with an ambulance, but with a small army of children, who clamber up into the cabs and, perched on cushions, steer their massive loads expertly to the dumping ground. </p> <p>This scene reveals the profound cynicism of the Naples mafiosi, the camorra, who pocket vast sums to dispose of northern Italy's toxic industrial waste in built-up areas in the south. But it also shows the limitless resource of cheap labour available to the Camorra, supplied by an underclass of illegal immigrants, drug addicts and uneducated but resourceful youths, for whom organised crime represents the only way out of poverty. </p> <p>Roberto Saviano, the young journalist and author of the bestselling book on which this film is based, did his research among gangs of illegal workers - on the docks, in the clandestine clothing factories, dealing drugs in the piazza - and their fight for survival is the real story in this shocking portrait of life under the Naples criminal sistema (system). In casting his film, Garrone made a point of using local people as extras, adding an unpolished intensity to his documentary-style camerawork. We are always uncomfortably close to the action, like another member of the crowd; in the dimly lit corridors and cramped kitchens, we are not granted the privilege of seeing what's about to happen. Garrone said he wanted to film Gomorrah like a war report, because that is, essentially, what it is. </p> <p>This decision backfired somewhat when inmates watching the film in a Naples prison recognised a fellow camorrista on screen. Giovanni Venosa was wanted by the police for his organised crime activities. After his ill-advised moment of fame, he is back in custody. </p> <p>Naples is a natural film set: the bay, with Vesuvius puffing away in the background; the theatrical districts where rich and poor live literally on top of each other. In the early 1960s, Francesco Rosi's Le Mani Sulla Citt\u00e0 (Hands Over the City) showed the dramatic contrast between grimy tenements collapsing under the developers' machinery, and the magnificent views from the corrupt councillors' offices. Gomorrah focuses on the grimy underbelly of a suburb. Much of the action takes place in the imposing housing projects: on the inside, they are like prisons, where the drug dealers' teenage lookouts watch every movement. With a nod to Fellini, a stolen statue is raised slowly on ropes for delivery to someone's apartment. But there is no joyful call of raucous women's voices in this version of Naples: no Sophia Loren hanging out laundry and swearing amusingly at the neighbours. The women here are frightened, cowering indoors, trying to save their boys from danger. </p> <p>Gomorra's one dissenting presence is a young graduate who is taken on as Uncle Franco's assistant, but eventually revolts against the careless poisoning of the land. This character, the film's quiet conscience, is called Roberto; but despite the presence of so many non-actors, he is not played by the author, for the simple reason that the author now lives in hiding, under police protection. Like the Sicilian journalist Lirio Abbate, who found a bomb under his car after writing a book about the boss of cosa nostra, Saviano's life has been threatened for revealing the clans' secrets. </p> <p>This is a very different world from the cosy rapport between the American cosa nostra and Hollywood film-makers. In the old days, mobsters loved to hang out with George Raft in Beverly Hills, while the New York families all want James Caan to come to their weddings. </p> <p>In fact, Naples has its own celebrity criminals. As the bosses of an industry worth a reported \u20ac150bn (\u00a3119bn) a year, the heads of the most powerful clans are treated like local heroes. The Giuliano family controls the Forcella district of Naples; Erminia Giuliano had her photograph taken drinking champagne with Diego Maradona, while her brother, the blue-eyed boss, Luigi, released records of himself singing nostalgic ballads. Naples' poor and disenfranchised youth need someone to look up to, and the charismatic bosses fulfil that role. Giuseppe Tornatore's 1984 film Il Camorrista (The Professor), based on the life of Raffaele Cutolo - a messianic figure who formed a splinter group and caused the death of 300 people - depicts a fascinating criminal mind still exercising power from behind maximum security prison walls. </p> <p>Since then, other Italian film-makers have moved on to examine more wide-ranging issues. In 1994, La Scorta (The Escort), directed by Ricky Tognazzi, depicted the courage and dedication of a judge's bodyguard under continual threat of assassination. In I Cento Passi (The Hundred Steps), Marco Tullio Giordano told the story of anti-mafia campaigner Peppino Impastato, and his brutal murder at the hands of his father's mafia friends. Another Neapolitan, Paolo Sorrentino, has more recently taken on the mafia; in The Consequences of Love, he depicted it as a ruthlessly efficient machine, its money laundered by suited bankers in Zurich, its gunmen in shell suits eating fast food. And Sorrentino's new film, Il Divo, is a biography of Italy's long-time premier Giulio Andreotti, and shows mafia turncoats dramatically incriminating corrupt politicians, their former allies.</p> <p>However, Gomorrah's subject is not the flashy lifestyle of the bosses - it is the misery they inflict on an entire population. The title comes from the words of a campaigning priest's call for people to open their eyes to what was happing to Naples: \"We must turn and look at what is happening, what is raining down on Gomorrah ...\" Saviano's story is a powerful cri de coeur. He records 3,600 camorra-related murders in his lifetime, and he's only 28. </p> <p>The camorra's activities also spill over into public policy. Over the past year, news footage from Naples has shown uncollected rubbish strewn across the streets, with evil-smelling fires smouldering in the markets. These heaps of rotting garbage have become emblematic of the city's endemic corruption. The camorra makes much of its money from garbage, and for years has stuffed all kinds of rubbish, including highly dangerous toxic waste, into landfill sites. In defiance of police and even the military, residents have blocked the construction of new waste disposal sites and incinerators on land adjoining their homes and their children's schools - a protest that now seems unstoppable after arsenic was discovered in the hardcore beneath a newly built school. </p> <p>But the traditional mafia activities go on. In the Naples suburb of Secondigliano, a war for domination of the drug trade, between the Di Lauros and the Spaniards, or Secessionists, is being fought. Last week, a gang of youths was arrested after a series of violent muggings. One was wearing a bracelet identifying him with one of the factions. \"It's a clear sign that he aspires to a life of crime,\" said a police spokesman. In Gomorrah, this aspiration is the death of hope. One of the film's most terrible sequences follows Tot\u00f2, a lad of 13, bright-eyed and elfin-featured, who wants desperately to be part of the clan. He understands what's required of a mafia soldier - he is quick, discreet, resourceful. And for his loyalty, they exact a terrible price, when he is forced to betray his best friend's mother. While her husband is in prison, her son has changed sides, but she refuses to move away. Tot\u00f2 must help his friends kill her, by luring her out of her flat. Tragically, this is a true story. </p> <p>The mafia depends on its illegal workforce - anyone attempting to offer unemployed addicts and desperadoes a glimpse of an alternative way of life puts himself in immediate danger. In the mid-1980s, Father Peppino Diana set up a welcome centre for African immigrants in the Naples hinterland to stop them being recruited by the mafia. This was a direct challenge to the camorra's business practices. When the warring clans made the streets unsafe and the population virtual prisoners, Don Peppino wrote an open letter of protest. His famous letter, entitled \"For the love of my people I will not stay silent\", was distributed over Christmas 1991. He called on the church to stand up against the camorra's rule, which he called \"a form of terrorism\", and denounced the clans' business practices: \"Extortion that has left our region with no potential for development; kickbacks of 20 per cent on construction projects; illegal drug trafficking, which has created gangs of marginalised youth and unskilled workers at the beck and call of criminal organisations.\" In March 1994, Don Peppino was shot dead in church, as he prepared for Sunday mass. </p> <p>\"The dead are the least revealing element of the camorra's real power,\" Saviano writes, \"but they are the most visible trace.\" Mafia films have always sated their audiences' desire for big hits, splattering gunshots and gleeful explosions. In The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola created an elegant counterpoint between a christening and a massacre; Scorsese's Casino opens with an operatic car bomb. But these violent moments pass quickly. As Gomorrah so powerfully demonstrates, the survivors' fear lingers on. </p> <p>\u2022 Clare Longrigg is the author of Boss of Bosses (John Murray)</p>",
  "<p>Schools in England are to be rated on the proportion of their pupils who attend top universities, in a move designed to increase pressure on secondaries to reduce their drop-out rate at 16 and promote university to students in disadvantaged areas. </p> <p>The plans are contained in a report by the National Council of Education Excellence, a body set up by Gordon Brown to operate as a \"sounding board\" for the direction of education. Brown backed the plans, saying: \"The recommendations will help us to achieve our goal of achieving world class standards of education in our country.\" Universities will collect more data on social and educational backgrounds to help them identify students from a low-scoring school who show promise. The controversial move, which will see more universities tailoring A-level scores to a student's background, should help end the middle-class stranglehold over the most competitive university places, the report's authors say. </p> <p>All schools and colleges will have to enter a partnership with a business and university in a move ministers believe will drive up standards. Universities will be under pressure to sponsor an academy or partner with a school in a trust. The report also puts pressure on schools by introducing a benchmark so they are rated according to their pupils' destinations. </p> <p>The report, devised by members of the NCEE including the prime minister, ministers, vice-chancellors and chief executives of large companies, also says: </p> <p>\u2022 Every primary pupil should visit a university to raise their aspirations early;</p> <p>\u2022 There should be an overhaul of careers guidance with schools inspected on the quality offered to pupils;</p> <p>\u2022 Reforms will focus on 600 schools judged as under-performing;</p> <p>\u2022 Private schools should be brought more closely into the system with local authorities including them on some planning and national bodies.</p> <p>The report, which ministers are promising to implement in full, also announces a moratorium on the use of the new A* grades at A-level which were introduced to help universities and employers distinguish between the top students. Universities have voiced concerns that teachers will not immediately be able to predict which pupils might get one. There have been separate concerns that the grade will be dominated by private school pupils. </p> <p>Steve Smith, vice-chancellor of Exeter University and chair of the university group of the NCEE, said: \"We got a lot of evidence that pupils are poorly advised of their options at some schools.\" </p> <p>University chiefs said schools have to do more to increase student numbers. </p> <p>Prof Rick Trainor, president of Universities UK, said: \"Universities make strenuous efforts to seek out potential, but they cannot admit people who are not applying.\"</p>",
  "<p>More than one in five teachers would like the cane reinstated to punish pupils in cases of \"extreme\" bad behaviour, a survey has revealed. </p> <p>The most common reason cited for supporting corporal punishment was the deterioration of behaviour in schools, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/09/schools.uk1\">more than 20 years after corporal punishment was abolished</a>.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by the Times Educational Supplement, asked 6,162 teachers, mostly in the state sector, whether they supported the \"right to use corporal punishment in extreme cases\". Just over 20% said they would. </p> <p>Comments from teachers who took part in the poll suggest some desperation for new sanctions to tackle poor behaviour.</p> <p>Ravi Kasinathan, a primary teacher, said: \"There is justification, or an argument, for bringing back corporal punishment, if only as a deterrent. I believe some children just don't respond to the current sanctions.\" </p> <p>Judith Cookson, a supply teacher, said: \"Children's behaviour is now absolutely outrageous in the majority of schools. I am a supply teacher, so I see very many schools and there are no sanctions.\"</p> <p>The findings drew shocked responses from children's rights charities and teaching unions who sought to distance themselves from the teachers' views.</p> <p>Sir Al Aynsley-Green, the children's commissioner for England, said: \"All forms of physical punishment against children and young people are completely unacceptable and go against the UN convention on the rights of the child, which the UK accepted in 1991. There are far more effective and positive methods of discipline than physical punishment.\"</p> <p>Anne Longfield, chief executive of the charity 4Children, said: \"It demonstrates an underlying acceptance that corporal punishment is still in some way acceptable and an answer to problems. That is a shame on all of us.\"</p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"To put it another way, 80% of teachers are not in favour of a return to corporal punishment. The NUT could not support the views expressed by those in favour of hitting children.\"</p> <p>A Department for Children, Schools and Families spokeswoman said: \"The authority of school staff should not be challenged by pupils. Teachers already have the statutory power to use reasonable force to restrain or control pupils. However, we are clear that this power must be used appropriately when the risks of not using force are greater ... Violence against children is clearly unacceptable and illegal.\"</p>",
  "<p>A busy week preparing food and garden entries for our village show - and tidying the garden, because events for the show were to be held in my field. Two large marquees, a display from the army, alpacas, a sheepdog trial, a fun run, a dog show and more. Two days before the event it was cancelled, due to the serious wet weather and flooding this area has recently suffered. So, on the day of our abandoned village event, I went to Cresswell beach near Druridge Bay, where the body of a 20ft-long whale had been washed up - a rare thing to happen. Maritime salvage teams on our north-east coast normally deal only with shipwrecks. Apparently, under British law dating back centuries, beached whales, dolphins, porpoises and sturgeon are described as royal fish and are the property of the Queen.</p> <p>I took my dog on a lead, and as we made our way through the sand dunes on to the beach several gulls began circling above us and one of them made it plain that they did not want intruders. The bird got quite close, sweeping in and dipping in the wind currents, his inscrutable face turned towards us. He was objecting to the dog. When we reached the shore the gull simply walked away, peering over his sleek shoulder to see if I was still coming down to his territory.</p> <p>The carcass of the whale had been roped off prior to disposal, and a member of the coastguard staff told me that they were not yet sure whether it was a minke or a fin whale, but it was probably a minke. He said that he was more used to finding the occasional dead seal or porpoise on the coast. One of the coastguards told me that there had been a lot of people coming down to look at the whale and that they had had to rope it off to stop dogs investigating the carcass, which was beginning to smell a bit.</p>",
  "<p>Not many British hedge fund bosses have been keen to open their Mayfair doors and explain themselves to a baying mob looking for someone to blame for the recent spasms of panic that have overtaken the stockmarkets and threatened the existence of all but a handful of the nation's largest banks.</p> <p>Andrew Baker, who played a major role in building a number of successful funds, has been pushed forward as deputy chief executive of the Alternative Investment Management Association to speak up for the industry.</p> <p>He recognises much of the damage has already been done. The popular impression endures that, in the words of Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, it was \"short-selling spivs and speculators\" that forced HBOS, Britain's largest mortgage bank, into a rushed takeover agreement with Lloyds TSB last month.</p> <p>With the markets in chaos, regulators in London, New York and elsewhere responded with emergency bans on short-selling in financial stocks - a move that seemed to confirm the prevailing suspicion that secretive hedge funds were placing huge bets on falling share prices, profiteering from the near meltdown that followed.</p> <p>But within days of the ban, a trickle of market data began to suggest short-selling activity in HBOS - and in Bradford &amp; Bingley and other stocks - had very little if anything to do with the heavy falls in the banks' share prices that caused so much anger. </p> <p><strong>Witch hunt</strong></p> <p>\"It has been a monumental exercise in scapegoating,\" says Baker. \"And that's where we've obviously failed. We've not been able to stop these wilder stories circulating. Suddenly - boom - all hedge funds are short-sellers, they're all market manipulators and they're all short-selling the banks, driving them to destruction and they don't care about broad financial stability issues.\"</p> <p>There followed a string of tabloid name-and-shame attacks on fund managers linked with short-selling bank shares. Even Church of England leaders joined the witch hunt. John Sentamu, archbishop of York, likened short sellers to \"bank robbers and asset strippers\".</p> <p>Within days, however, this last attack turned out to be an embarrassing own-goal when it was noted that \u00a313m of church assets had been invested in shares in Man Group, the hedge fund operator. The church ethics committee had also approved the practice of lending out shares to short-sellers - a decision that has been hastily reviewed.</p> <p>Baker points out many other critics appear to be similarly unaware of their own indirect interests in these exotic, often higher-risk investments.</p> <p>\"In all of this excitement about how disgraceful it is, a huge chunk of investment is coming from the very people who appear to be raising the criticisms. It's coming from their pension fund, or from insurance companies, or from banks who themselves have big asset-management activities or who themselves have big hedge fund activities.\"</p> <p>Despite this indirect connection to ordinary people, there remains an impression that the industry has distanced itself from the more prosaic parts of the investment community - not to mention the wider world. Hedge funds have tended to shun the City and Canary Wharf addresses where most other financial players are to be found and clustered in Mayfair, best known as the capital's casino district, where winning or losing millions on the spin of a wheel is just a form of entertainment.</p> <p>Occasional reports of pay packages handed out to star fund managers have also highlighted a chasm that has opened between the nation's smartest investors and the rest of us. Greg Coffey, the 36-year-old Australian manager at GLG, is thought to have earned $300m (\u00a3170m) last year after raising the value of his emerging markets fund by 51%. That is more than seven times the \u00a323m earned last year by WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell, the highest-paid chief executive in the FTSE 100. Coffey's staggering earning power was underlined when it emerged he planned to strike out on his own, forgoing a $200m package designed to keep him working at GLG.</p> <p>Baker is unapologetic. \"It all comes from a transparent formula, published in the [fund] prospectus. No one is being fooled. There's a base fee which pays for electricity, the carpets and cleaners, and then there's the performance fee. Spectacular returns only kick in when there's spectacular performance.</p> <p>\"These people are proprietors in their own business - that's one of the compelling sales propositions: they eat their own cooking - and they're there for the long term. Those that are getting all this publicity because they're rich as Croesus have been there a long time. They are very smart and they are taking bets off the table at the moment because they sense trouble ahead. They are not trying to bet the shop on one last spasm of market excess before the game's over.\"</p> <p>Baker, who describes his own background as that of \"an ordinary comprehensive boy from south Wales\", insists the media preoccupation with the rewards of the star fund managers doesn't reflect the realities of the wider industry. \"It's like focusing on Cristiano Ronaldo's salary and what he does at the weekend, as opposed to whether football has any value to society and whether people enjoy watching it.\"</p> <p>Baker himself has spent much of his career designing and building funds rather than managing money. He is down to earth, a patient voice explaining complex subjects. Despite having shed every trace of south Wales from his accent, he is not so detached from the rest of middle-class Britain. He recounts how he gets a lot of stick at home for a mathematical approach to everyday issues - \"it drives my wife crazy\". His daughter last week told him: \"Dad, you don't have to turn everything into a business plan.\"</p> <p>Though he knows his voice will struggle to be heard in the charged atmosphere of Whitehall and media-land, Baker is confident he can, in time, persuade those that matter of the useful role hedge fund operations and short selling have to play. </p> <p>The paradox is that the backlash comes just as the industry faces in all probability its worst ever monthly investment performance, with many firms on the brink of collapse. Far from profiteering from short-selling banks, most firms are nursing heavy losses, burned by the volatile market just as more orthodox investors have been. </p> <p><strong>Moment of reckoning</strong></p> <p>A repeat of the run on Northern Rock has so far been averted among high street banks, but scores of hedge funds have been faced with investors clamouring to withdraw money. Some managers have responded by asking them to lock in their cash for longer, promising that performance fees will be halved. Others have imposed a \"gate\" rule, limiting monthly redemptions to 10%. </p> <p>The third quarter closed this week and many managers are holding their breath as asset valuations are being assessed. \"It is a moment of reckoning,\" says Baker. \"You've had enormous market volatility, you've had the short-selling ban, you've had Lehmans and you've had redemptions.\"</p> <p>What has been remarkable, he suggests, is how few major funds have gone to the wall. \"There are people going out of business but they are doing it in an orderly manner. They are just saying: 'We can't make the returns we were expecting to so here's what's left - we want to distribute it to shareholders.' There's a lot of orderly liquidations but the sorts of spectacular blow-ups that people worry about - there have been hardly any of those.\"</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born </strong></p> <p>December 1956, Fareham, Hampshire</p> <p><strong>Education</strong></p> <p>Barry Boys' Comprehensive School, Barry, South Glamorgan.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a> warned yesterday of rising defaults on loans amid signs that a worsening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> is prompting sharp falls in house prices and a squeeze on consumer spending power.</p> <p>In a quarterly health check of credit conditions conducted before the recent market turmoil, Threadneedle Street said lenders had reduced the availability of credit by more than had been expected and anticipated an even tougher environment in the next three months.</p> <p>The report which fanned City speculation about a cut in interest rates next week coincided with a report from the Nationwide showing that house prices dropped by 1.7% in September - the 11th successive monthly fall. Average prices have now fallen by \u00a323,000 since their peak in October last year, while the 12.4% annual rate of decline was the largest since the Nationwide first published its monthly snapshot in the early 1990s.</p> <p>Fionnuala Earley, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"The higher cost and lower availability of finance resulting from the credit crunch were factors in triggering the slowdown.\" She added that the \"current unrest\" in the financial markets threatened to increase mortgage costs.</p> <p>Seema Shah, property analyst at Capital Economics, said the data \"brought further evidence that the correction in the housing market is unfolding with unprecedented speed. The toxic combination of the mortgage credit squeeze, sharply slowing economic activity, and plummeting buyer confidence have caused house prices to fall at a record pace\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Marks &amp; Spencer chairman, Sir Stuart Rose, revealed M&amp;S's worst sales figures for three years. Like-for-like sales of clothing and homewares - which exclude gains from newly opened stores - tumbled 6.4% in the last three months compared to the same time last year. Food sales, which should have been boosted by inflation, were down 5.9% as customers defected to lower-priced stores.</p> <p>Rose said: \"We want shoppers to have confidence, but they are worried about inflation, they are worried about interest rates, they are worried about their house price and they are worried about the safety of their money in their bank.\" He announced a cutback in investment over the next two years in an effort to conserve cash. He also refused to rule out job losses, though he insisted the retailer had \"no immediate plans\" for any redundancies.</p> <p>The gloomy range of data was completed by a survey by CIPS/Markit showing a record contraction in the construction industry, with house building particularly weak. With downbeat data also published in the US, stock markets in London and New York fell. The FTSE 100 closed 89.3 points lower at 4870.3 while Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average had lost almost 300 points by early afternoon.</p>",
  "<p>Johnny \"Dizzy\" Moore, who has died aged 69 after a long battle with colon cancer, was one of Jamaica's most renowned trumpeters. As a founding member of the Skatalites, Jamaica's premier session band of the early 1960s, he helped create the ska form and backed scores of significant singers, including the young Bob Marley.</p> <p>Moore was born in Kingston, where he was raised in a strict Seventh Day Adventist household. An early fascination with music led him to fashion rudimentary wind instruments out of papaya stalks and pumpkin vines. After discovering that a drumming neighbour learned his musical craft at the Alpha boys' school, a Catholic charitable institution for \"wayward boys\" that was a breeding ground for some of Jamaica's most talented musicians, Moore set his mind on attending Alpha, despite the social stigma surrounding its students. Most Alpha boarders were orphans or street urchins whose parents could not afford their upkeep, but Moore gained entry by pretending to be out of control, so that his disapproving parents, who objected to the school's Catholic foundation, would allow him to learn music there.</p> <p>At Alpha, where he studied electrical engineering and printing as well as music, he grew close to his fellow students Don Drummond, who soon emerged as the country's most outstanding trombonist, and Lester Sterling, later a leading alto saxophonist.</p> <p>Upon graduating in 1955, Moore joined the Jamaica Military Band, but was ultimately thrown out for playing bebop and refusing to shave. He then joined an uptown jazz orchestra, but was fired for refusing to cut his hair.</p> <p>Facing growing discrimination for his Rastafarian beliefs, he retreated to Count Ossie's Rasta camp, where he took part in the late-night jam sessions that gave birth to ska, just as Jamaica was struggling to free itself from Britain's colonial yoke.</p> <p>After being spotted by Clement \"Sir Coxsone\" Dodd, founder of Studio One, Moore and his peers regularly featured on recording sessions cut for Dodd during the early 1960s. Then, in 1964, following the demise of the leading session group the Cavaliers, Dodd decided to form an official ska supergroup, featuring Moore, Drummond and Sterling, along with the pianist Jackie Mittoo, drummer Lloyd Knibb, bassist Lloyd Brevett, guitarist Jerome \"Jah Jerry\" Haynes and saxophonists Roland Alphonso and Tommy McCook. </p> <p>Named the Skatalites (in reference to a recently-launched Sputnik satellite), the group was officially together for only 14 months, but changed the shape of Jamaican popular music as chief proponents of the ska form, backing all the leading artists of the day, including Owen Gray, Alton Ellis, and Toots and the Maytals. Skatalites instrumentals such as Tear Up, Guns of Navarone, which also made the UK top 40, and Ball of Fire topped the Jamaican charts, and Moore, whose nickname \"Dizzy\" stemmed from his intricate soloing, was a key feature of songs including Ska La Parisienne, Dick Tracy, Nimrod and Ringo, the last cut for the producer Justin Yap.</p> <p>Following the break-up of the Skatalites, McCook and Knibb defected to Treasure Isle, the producer Duke Reid's rival stable, to form the Supersonics, while Moore, Alphonso and Mittoo remained at Studio One as the Soul Vendors, touring Britain with Ken Boothe in 1967. Returning to Jamaica, where he was briefly active in the uptown club act Kes Chin and the Souvenirs, Moore then joined the Supersonics, helping to define the rock steady style at Treasure Isle, but after a tour of Canada, the group disbanded, and he began to rely on session work.</p> <p>Although less active from the mid-1970s, Moore joined the re-formed Skatalites to perform at Reggae Sunsplash in 1983, contributing to the album Return of the Big Guns the following year. In 1989, the group backed Bunny Wailer on an international tour and began touring as the Skatalites in 1990, but as most of the band lived in New York, he was usually absent from their line-up, though he was later active in the Jamaica All Stars with Justin Hinds. </p> <p>He is survived by several children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p> <p>\u2022 John Arlington \"Dizzy\" Moore, trumpeter, born October 5 1938; died August 16 2008</p>",
  "<p>The pride of the nation is secured. Last night, two Britons joined a long and prestigious list of Ig Nobel prizewinners at the annual awards ceremony at Harvard University.</p> <p>The Ig Nobel for literature was awarded for research into the different breeds of unpleasant character one might encounter in the workplace, while the Ig award for nutrition went to scientists at Oxford University who proved stale crisps taste better when eaten to an accompaniment of crunchy sounds.</p> <p>The Igs have become an irreverent highlight of the academic calendar, an annual exercise to celebrate research that makes people laugh first and think later. They are timed to coincide with the rather more lucrative and legitimate Nobels, which are awarded in Stockholm next week.</p> <p>The ceremony is hosted by the tongue-in-cheek journal, Annals of Improbable Research, and is attended by real Nobel prizewinners and a 1,000-strong audience. This year's recipients were given 60 seconds to deliver their acceptance speech, a time limit enforced by an eight-year-old girl.</p> <p>David Sims of the Cass Business School in London, whose paper You Bastard: A Narrative Exploration of the Experience of Indignation within Organisations, won the literature prize, said: \"I'm delighted. The whole ethos of the Ig Nobels is a wonderful way to make people think.\" The paper examines how people construct roles as clever bastards, devious bastards or bastard ex machina, and goes on to examine the mixture of joy and guilt of labelling someone as such.</p> <p>Sims wrote the paper after puzzling how right-thinking people who often stressed the importance of appreciating others' arguments would give up and brand someone a bastard. \"We are all novelists writing the next chapter of our life story and with bastards, we need to understand what kind of character they are trying to create,\" Sims said.</p> <p>Charles Spence, professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, was awarded the Ig for nutrition for his investigation into the gastronomical role of sound. In the study, volunteers ate crisps of varying freshness while wearing headphones. </p> <p>As they ate, the sound of the crisp breaking was modified by a computer and played back to see if it changed their perception of the crisp's freshness. By making the crunch sounds louder, or by boosting the high frequencies, Spence made people rate the crisps 15% fresher.</p> <p>The work led to a collaboration with Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, who played diners the sound of crashing waves to improve the flavour of oysters, and sizzling bacon to enhance his egg and bacon ice cream. \"I'm very happy to be receiving the award,\" said Spence, who is now testing why crisps come in such noisy packets.</p> <p>The Ig Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to Dan Ariely at Duke University in North Carolina for a landmark study proving that costly placebos are more effective than cheap ones. Ariely's team told volunteers they were being given a new kind of painkiller, with some receiving an expensive one and others a much cheaper version. </p> <p>Even though all of them received the same sugar pills, those who thought their pills were more expensive reported less pain when they were given small electric shocks. </p> <p>\"This is the proudest day of my life,\" said Ariely. \"The Ig Nobels are humorous, but the work often examines things in real life, like why buttered toast is more likely to land face down.\"</p> <p>Ariely said his work has serious implications for the medical industry, because many patients are told they can only have cheaper drugs, or have inexpensive-looking medication, which could undermine how effective the drugs are. While the active ingredients of the drug will help treat symptoms, often they work in tandem with the placebo effect, which triggers the body's own healing mechanisms.</p> <p>Among other winners were the people of Switzerland who claimed the Ig peace prize for adopting the legal principle that plants have dignity; Geoffrey Miller at the University of New Mexico who won the economics prize for showing lap dancers received more in tips when they were ovulating; and scientists in San Diego who showed that hair, string and almost anything else will become tangled given the chance, earning them the Ig award for physics.</p> <p>Not all of the winners understood why their work had made people laugh. Marie-Christine Cadiergues, who won the prize for biology by proving the fleas on dogs jump higher than those on cats, said: \"Despite appearing funny and maybe crazy and useless to some people, this was part of a larger work on the biology of fleas ... A better knowledge of flea biology can provide a better control and therefore help vets, pet owners and overall our favourite pets.\"</p> <p>Toshiyuki Nakagaki at Hokkaido University in Japan was similarly nonplussed about receiving the Ig award for cognitive neuroscience, after showing that slime mould could navigate a simple maze. \"I was wondering which aspect of our research attracted the Ig Nobel prize. How does the prize evaluate our research? We are always serious and don't know why they laugh once before thinking,\" Nakagaki said.</p> <p>The real Nobel prizes are awarded next week, beginning with medicine on Monday.</p> <h2>And the winners are ...</h2> <p><strong>Physics</strong></p> <p>Won by Dorian Raymer at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, California, for discovering why ropes, hair and cables get more knotted the longer they are. </p> <p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p> <p>Jointly awarded to Sharee Umpierre at the University of Puerto Rico for discovering Coke is a spermicide, and to Chuang-Ye Hong at Taipei Medical University for showing that it is not.</p> <p><strong>Biology</strong></p> <p>Marie-Christine Cadiergues at the National Veterinary School in Toulouse for discovering that fleas jump higher on dogs than on cats.</p> <p><strong>Medicine</strong></p> <p>Dan Ariely at Duke University for demonstrating that expensive placebos are better painkillers than cheaper ones.</p> <p><strong>Economics</strong></p> <p>Geoffrey Miller at the University of New Mexico for discovering that lap dancers get larger tips when they are ovulating.</p> <p><strong>Archaeology</strong></p> <p>Astolfo Mello Araujo at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil for measuring how the contents of an archaeological dig can be disrupted by the actions of an armadillo.</p> <p><strong>Cognitive neuroscience</strong></p> <p>Toshiyuki Nakagaki, at Hokkaido University in Japan, for discovering that amoeboid organisms can solve puzzles.</p> <p><strong>Literature</strong></p> <p>David Sims at Cass Business School, London, for discovering why there are bastards in the workplace. </p> <p><strong>Nutrition</strong></p> <p>Charles Spence at Oxford University for making crisps taste better by modifying the sound of their crunch.</p> <p><strong>Peace</strong></p> <p>The Swiss federal ethics committee on non-human biotechnology and the citizens of Switzerland for acknowledging the dignity of plant life.</p>",
  "<p>James Morrison is incontinent with sincerity. In case the title of his second album weren't earnest enough, just check out the cover picture of him fretting soulfully on the kerb, and, if you must, explore the music inside. Despite looking as if he has been cloned from cell scrapings taken from Chris Martin and James Blunt, Morrison has neither the former's quivering anxiety nor the latter's creepy streak, thus attaining a level of blandness that is almost zen. Almost every song here is about a woman who has wronged him, a woman he has wronged, or little children, who can do no wrong. \"You see life is a crazy thing,\" he explains on Please Don't Stop the Rain. \"There'll be good times and there'll be bad times.\" Indeed. And despite Morrison's Rod Stewart-esque rasp, this overproduced blue-eyed soul, co-written with a small army of MOR hitmakers, is dead from the waist down. The result: airplay for him, boredom for you.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard not to be impressed with the way Noel Gallagher has managed to turn Oasis' apparently permanent state of musical stasis into a matter of class pride. \"It's a working-class thing ... I'm not an experimenter,\" he recently remarked, as if making interesting music was an unacceptable capitulation to bourgeois mores, like joining a snooty golf club. </p> <p>It's a smart bit of doublethink, but there's something depressing about this not-for-the-likes-of-us attitude, not least the sneaking feeling that Noel Gallagher - clearly a sharp and intelligent man - doesn't believe a word of it, that it's bluster designed to hide fear, the knowledge that the one time he did try to experiment, the result was Oasis's catastrophic 2000 album Standing on the Shoulder of Giants. The millions of records and tickets Oasis sell must come as consolation, but you wonder if Gallagher occasionally steals a rueful glance at his former Battle of Britpop nemesis - wistfully noting, say, the critically acclaimed Mandarin opera - before going back to dutifully promoting the new Oasis album with a single that goes \"love is a litany, a magical mystery\" and assurances to the press that it sounds like the Beatles.</p> <p>At least he can console himself that he's never going to get sued under the Trade Descriptions Act: Oasis's seventh album arrives bearing Helter Skelter drum fills, a sample from John Lennon's final radio interview, a coda to The Turning stolen from Dear Prudence and lyrical references to Lennon's Gimme Some Truth and Ian MacDonald's Fabs book Revolution in the Head. Complaining about Oasis's lyrics seems rather like shooting fish in a barrel, or as Gallagher would doubtless have it, shooting fish in a barrel/ with a man called Darryl/ singing a carol/ in American Apparel. Suffice to say there's a chorus that advises you to \"shake your reptile\" - Crocodile? Snake? Tortoise? - and that the younger Gallagher brother has developed a weird tic of continually reminding you that you're listening to a song, as if concerned you might think you're listening to a lecture on particle physics: \"Here's a song,\" he offers on both I'm Outta Time and Ain't Got Nothin'.</p> <p>That said, both are among the album's highlights, the former an effective exercise in shamelessly button-pushing balladry, the latter a two-minute brawl of a song, driven by an off-kilter drum pattern. It's one of a handful of moments when Dig Out Your Soul works because it does precisely what Noel Gallagher says it doesn't and experiments, at least a little, with the Oasis formula. The opening Bag It Up offers an impressively grimy, low-rent brand of freakbeat, while Falling Down is, by Oasis's standards at least, opaque and oddly delicate.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the other Liam contribution, Soldier On, highlights Dig Out Your Soul's biggest problem: the mid-tempo plod that has become Oasis's default rhythmic setting. There's something trudging and weary about it, redolent of gritted teeth and furrowed brows, of labour rather than effortless inspiration. It's further compounded by a surfeit of lyrical references to having a go, sticking with it and not giving up - \"You've got to keep on keeping on\", \"My head's in the clouds but at least I'm trying\" - and by the straining mannerisms of Liam's vocals, which at their most affected sound less like bracingly abrasive sneering than the dogged exertions of a man who's a little backed up.</p> <p>Oasis can still occasionally produce songs suggestive of the breezy insouciance that marked their early years - the new single The Shock of the Lightning among them - but more often on Dig Out Your Soul, they sound as though they're killing themselves trying to come up with something that'll do. And sometimes what they come up with won't do at all, as on Gem Archer's To Be Where There's Life, a song that signifies its mystical, psychedelic bent by opening with a sitar going sprrrrrroinnnnng. It's the kind of hackneyed gesture that seems to underline Oasis's reductive view of music, the nagging suspicion that, far from being steeped in the nuances of classic rock, they've only actually heard the Greatest Hits.</p> <p>For more than a decade, Oasis have continued to sell millions of records while stuck in a musical holding pattern. It's a perversely impressive feat, partly down to their fans, who, depending on your perspective, are either remarkably loyal or risibly undemanding. But it's also down to Oasis' willingness to graft, dutifully touring, never declining to play the hits. Neither masterpiece nor catastrophe, more experimental than Noel would allow but no one's idea of adventurous, a lot of Dig Out Your Soul sounds like hard work, and not in the latter-day Scott Walker sense of unorthodox or avant garde. Perhaps that's fitting.</p>",
  "<p>The Catholic church is exhorting Catholics to oppose parliamentary reform of abortion law (Catholics must mobilise against abortion reforms, says archbishop, September 30) despite support for pragmatic modernisation from medical and nursing bodies and patient groups. The legal requirement for two doctors' signatures can delay women from abortion care. Reforms would permit abortion under the 24-week limit to be offered on the basis of informed patient consent and good clinical practice, as with other medical treatment. </p> <p>Reforms would allow early abortions in community settings, such as GPs' surgeries, where appropriate. With medical abortion under nine weeks' gestation, reforms would allow one of the drugs used to be taken at home, as is routine in the US. These drugs are already taken at home by UK women after early natural miscarriage. The reforms aim to allow abortion earlier, which is acknowledged to be safer and less invasive.</p> <p>Another proposal would extend the 1967 Act to Northern Ireland. UK citizens deserve equal legal rights to healthcare wherever they live and Northern Irish women should not have to travel to Britain for abortion in secrecy and stigma at their own expense. The Catholic church often speaks out against injustice and inequality, and supports the exercise of individual conscience in accordance with its beliefs. In contrast, sadly, its position on reproductive rights perpetuates injustice against women and fails to respect women's considered decisions, made in good conscience.</p> <p><strong>Jon O'Brien</strong>, Catholics for Choice, <strong>Ann Furedi</strong>, British Pregnancy Advisory Service, <strong>Julie Bentley</strong>, Family Planning Association, <strong>Simon Blake</strong>, Brook, <strong>John Bercow MP</strong>, Con, Buckingham, <strong>Dr Evan Harris MP</strong>, Lib Dem, Oxford West and Abingdon, <strong>Emily Thornberry MP</strong>, Lab, Islington South &amp; Finsbury, <strong>Dr Wendy Savage</strong>, Doctors for a Woman's Choice on Abortion, <strong>Marge Behrer</strong>, Voice for Choice, <strong>Lisa Hallgarten</strong>, Education for Choice, <strong>Louise Hutchins</strong>, Abortion Rights</p>",
  "<p>Any wild hope that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity\">Manchester City</a> may have entertained about adding Steven Gerrard to their roll call of the rich and famous was put into stark perspective yesterday when Dirk Kuyt insisted that no <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a> regular would consider leaving Anfield for Eastlands.</p> <p>The City manager, Mark Hughes, was at Anfield on Wednesday to witness the Liverpool captain scoring his 100th goal for his club with a trademark finish against PSV Eindhoven. The Champions League regulars will travel to the Champions League wannabes on Sunday with confidence soaring after an 11-game unbeaten start to the season. Before they even meet, however, Kuyt has drawn a distinction between City's ambition and Liverpool's reality, having dismissed suggestions that Sheikh Mansour's riches could lure Gerrard away from his boyhood club.</p> <p>It was not Hughes, of course, who unveiled the ambitious transfer wish-list that featured Gerrard and Cristiano Ronaldo and was designed to showcase City's new-found wealth in August. In fairness to Sheikh Mansour, who was responsible for the list, there was also a notable change of tack when his \u00a3200m takeover was completed last week with talk of gradual development, not gal\u00e1ctico signings. Clearly an educated football man had intervened and had a word.</p> <p>\"To score 100 goals from midfield is a great achievement and a lot of those goals have been great goals,\" said Kuyt yesterday. \"Stevie is Liverpool. It would be very difficult to buy him - he'd be a lot of money. But I don't think he'd ever leave Liverpool for Manchester City.</p> <p>\"We don't talk about Manchester City that much. We know they've got a new owner who has got a lot of money so we'll have to see what happens, but I don't think any Liverpool player would go to Manchester City, because we're a much bigger club. It won't be easy for them, especially if they want the big players. It is possible to buy big players but, if you want to buy big players who are already playing for big clubs, that is much more difficult.\"</p> <p>After the personal ordeal of his two flirtations with Chelsea the Liverpool captain is now happily ensconced at Anfield and in the company of some legendary figures in having reached his century. The 28-year-old is now level with Kevin Keegan on goals scored for Liverpool and, although unlikely to disturb Ian Rush, Roger Hunt, Kenny Dalglish and Robbie Fowler at the head of the scorers' chart, is the first midfielder in Liverpool's history to reach the 100 mark.</p> <p>\"Just to be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Dalglish, Rush and Fowler makes the hairs stand up on the back of my neck because everyone knows what they mean to this football club,\" said Gerrard. \"It's a fantastic achievement and it's one that I'm really proud of because no one needs me to tell them of all the great midfielders that have played for this club. But I doubt many of them managed to play as many games as I have and I've also played quite a few up front as well. There's no doubt about it, though, it does mean a lot to me.\"</p> <p>Gerrard's free-kick capped a landmark occasion for Liverpool, with Kuyt scoring the 100th Champions League goal under Rafael Ben\u00edtez in the manager's 250th game in charge and Robbie Keane flicking home his first for the club in his 11th appearance since a \u00a320.3m move from Tottenham Hotspur.</p> <p>\"The first goal is always important - it's always nice to get it out of the way. It stops people talking about it,\" said Keane. \"That's been the most annoying thing, because as a player I haven't been worrying about it.\"</p> <p>The Republic of Ireland captain revived his trademark celebration to mark his first for Liverpool but he was once advised to stop the cartwheels and pistol-shooting by the then Tottenham manager Martin Jol so it may not receive a regular airing at Anfield.</p> <p>He added: \"I've dreamt of doing that celebration as a Liverpool player since I was a kid. I haven't done the celebration in a while. At Spurs I only did it on special occasions, and this was a special occasion for me with Liverpool, scoring in an important game. I can put it back in the box now.\"</p>",
  "<p>As owners of four well-behaved, socialised dogs, we were disappointed by Andy Beckett's negative portrayal of mastiffs and staffordshire bull terriers, and his numerous references to the Dangerous Dogs Act (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/27/ukcrime.animalwelfare\">The wolf at the door</a>, September 27). The implication here, that certain breeds are automatically \"dangerous\", smacks of scaremongering.</p> <p>\"As the number of rough-looking mutts on Britain's streets has risen, so has their involvement in crime. Has man's best friend become more weapon than pet?\" the headline asks. We are the first to agree that there is a small proportion of owners who fall short of their dog ownership responsibilities, but in places the article is too simplistic.</p> <p>Beckett observes: \"A woman in her 30s talks on her mobile phone while her lean mastiff cross, off the lead, gallops back and forth. In another play area, another youngish woman stands smoking, a heavy black staffordshire beside her, also off the lead.\" Both these examples imply that a \"good\" dog owner simply keeps their dog on the lead. In reality a responsible dog owner ensures they have control of their dog at all times - on the lead or otherwise. An ill-disciplined dog on a lead can still be a liability.</p> <p>Beckett refers to \"other breeds with bodybuilders' necks and jaws like wheel clamps - French mastiffs, Japanese fighting dogs, South American hunting dogs\". Mentioning French mastiffs in the same sentence as the latter two breeds - which are banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act - implies that they are also illegal, when in fact the mastiffs are not. </p> <p>He cites banned breeds again - \"obscure Japanese and South American breeds\" (presumably the latter being the banned Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasileiro) - and then argues that \"there are almost certainly far more of them than in the early 90s\". Is Beckett really asserting that these particular banned breeds are readily available on the streets of Britain? Where is the evidence for this claim?</p> <p>However, we do agree that there are pit-bull-type dogs in ownership in the UK. Often these are described by their owners as \"staffy crosses\". Here in south-east London this is not unusual. In fact sometimes these are even nice dogs with decent owners. We suspect that the authorities are often not sufficiently knowledgable to act in these cases and do not have the necessary resources to investigate. Possibly the more important thing here would be ascertaining whether the owner was being responsible or not.</p> <p>A discussion on ways of tackling the problems caused by dangerous dogs and irresponsible owners would have been refreshing. Beckett cites Wandsworth council's proposal to microchip dogs on its estates. But why not have a national debate on the merits of a law requiring all pet dogs to be licensed, microchipped, neutered and adequately trained? </p> <p>Why not have a written test that owners would have to pass, similar to the driving theory test? Or a system where only registered breeders could apply for a licence to breed dogs, thus reducing the number of unwanted dogs and unethical breeders? These are only ideas, of course, but we need to have a debate if we really want to tackle the problems.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Flood and Liz Whimperley-Dixon are responsible owners of neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, trained, family-friendly and socialised mastiffs and staffordshire bull terriers<br><a href=\"mailto:chris.flood@mac.com\">chris.flood@mac.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Slowly, food is gaining political salience. Progress can only be measured in teaspoons, but yesterday, the Scottish administration announced universal free dinners for the first three years of primary school, while a smaller pilot, worth about \u00a314m, will be introduced in some English local authorities next year. And at the end of this year the ban on advertising fast food on TV watched predominately by children is finally fully implemented. Meanwhile, the patron saint of school dinners, Jamie Oliver, has returned to Rotherham, where in the notorious contraband chips incident two years ago mothers subverted his healthy-eating scheme. Once again he is scandalised, this time by how many people have never learned to cook. It is all progress. But it will take a lot more teaspoons before it is widely accepted that there is more than education and income shaping the food choices that people make. </p> <p>The long-term solution is to tackle the food and farming industries, which, through a lethal blend of subsidy and sales strategy, distort our choices in favour of food that is artificially cheap and tasty but nutritionally nasty. First, as our correspondent Felicity Lawrence argued powerfully earlier this week, it has to be recognised that diet has always been partly about class. In particular, the white working class has a long tradition of eating badly that was only fleetingly interrupted by second world war rationing (even now, research suggests that poor black Britons eat better than their white neighbours). It is true that too many of us too often eat high salt and fat ready-meals - far more than anywhere else in Europe. But what really counts is the class-based nutritional gap seen in the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. That is about local availability, high costs, low incomes and tradition, a poisonous mix most lethally reflected in health inequalities and life expectancy, but also in low educational attainment, for example, and ability to concentrate. Bad diet is both symptom and cause of poverty. </p> <p>As the Scottish government has realised, universal free school dinners are a powerful place to start challenging this cycle. Until it lost control in 2006, Hull's Labour council provided breakfast, healthy snacks and dinners. According to the final assessment, it improved behaviour and learning, while raising the children's awareness of healthy eating and their willingness to tackle unfamiliar dishes. It also raised school meal take-up from around 40% to over 60%, and ended the stigma attached to free school meals, which in turn made a \"significant impact\" on cutting disadvantage, all for barely 1% of the authority's education budget. It even made people feel good about their council.</p>",
  "<p>India's Congress party leadership and the Bush administration were celebrating yesterday after the US Senate finally approved a nuclear cooperation agreement that opens the way for a $14bn investment in new Indian reactors and nuclear plants over the next year alone. The deal also has wider strategic significance, bolstering US-India ties at a time of rising Chinese influence. </p> <p>President George Bush said the agreement, which took three years to negotiate, would \"strengthen our global nuclear non-proliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs responsibly\". A spokesman for India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who like Bush views the deal as a legacy issue, described it as \"historic and unprecedented\".</p> <p>Independent experts are less enthusiastic. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said: \"The agreement is a non-proliferation disaster. Contrary to the counterfactual claims of proponents and apologists, it does not bring India into the 'non-proliferation mainstream' and India's so-called separation plan is not credible.\"</p> <p>Kimball was referring to India's pledge to separate its civilian-related and military-related nuclear activities in return for unrestricted supplies of nuclear fuel and technology for the former. Indian claims that the deal transforms the country into a respectable, mainstream nuclear power are also fiercely disputed. Critics say that Delhi's continuing refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and the comprehensive test ban treaty, and uncertainty over whether it will test more bombs, places it beyond the pale. Worse than that, they say US acquiescence in India's non-compliance with the main nuclear weapons treaties undermines global security.</p> <p>The reaction of Pakistan (which like India carried out unauthorised nuclear tests in 1998 and has not signed the NPT) was instructive. The prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, said yesterday that Pakistan would demand similar access to nuclear supplies, \"and they will have to accommodate us\". </p> <p>Bush has trumpeted his administration's counter-proliferation efforts in recent months, saying he is responding to worries that terrorists as well as \"states of concern\" such as North Korea, Iran and Syria will obtain or enhance nuclear weapons capability. But progress has been limited.</p> <p>The India deal is certain to encourage Tehran, for example, in its claims that the west is applying a double standard by penalising what it claims is a similarly peaceful civilian nuclear power generation programme.</p> <p>At the same time, a leading expert, Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, warned this week that Iran would attain \"virtual nuclear weapons status\" by the time the next US president is inaugurated in January, three UN sanctions resolutions notwithstanding. Quoting the latest International Atomic Energy Agency report, Milhollin said: \"This means that it [Iran] will be able to produce, within a few months of deciding to do so, enough weapons-grade uranium to fuel a bomb.\"</p> <p>International attempts to inveigle North Korea into banning the bomb also hit trouble after the US insisted on an inspection regime so intrusive that, according to a New York Times editorial, \"only a state vanquished in war\" would accept it. </p> <p>With North Korea threatening to restart its reactor at Yongbyon, US envoy Chris Hill was in Pyongyang yesterday trying to head off collapse. While the state department insists the proposed inspection regime is not especially onerous, the suggestion in Washington is that the vice-president, Dick Cheney, would prefer negotiations to fail rather than accept a \"bad\" deal.</p> <p>Looked at from other perspectives, Bush's legacy on proliferation appears unimpressive, even frightening. US pressure on the 45-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group to bend its rules to facilitate the India deal reportedly verged on outright bullying, leaving that proliferation control body divided and weakened. Bush has meanwhile cancelled a nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Georgia in August.</p> <p>The US president will leave office amid unassuaged worries about Syria's intentions following the bombing by Israel of an alleged secret nuclear plant there. Notwithstanding Libya's welcome abandonment of its nuclear ambitions, nuclear programmes could yet mushroom across an Arab world increasingly nervous about Iran. On top of all that, Israel's nuclear arsenal remains uninspected and undeclared.</p> <p>Like India, Israel, sees itself as a deserving exception to the rules. The question now is: how much longer can the rules hold?</p>",
  "<p>Jelly Roll Morton had a business card proclaiming him to be \"the originator of jazz\". Yet he wasn't the greatest piano player in New Orleans; he is not even the greatest piano player in this play.</p> <p>Clare Brown's two-hander traces the relationship between Morton and his musical mentor, Tony Jackson, an obscure figure whose legacy survives only through the testimony of others. Lesser musicians would be told: \"Get up from that piano, you're hurting its feelings - let Tony play.\"</p> <p>Brown's play is a well-observed study in contrasts. Jackson was taciturn, African-American and gay; Morton was exuberant, Creole and fond of chasing the female organ from which he gained his vulgar nickname. It was only the piano that the two men held in common, forging a style loud and syncopated enough to work as background music in a bordello.</p> <p>Considering that this is a first work, produced on spec, Brown's writing shows incredible assurance. Giles Terera's Jackson and Kelsey Brookfield's Jelly Roll send the hipster dialogue back and forth as if trading riffs on the piano. Sarah Punshon provides eloquent direction and Simon Higlett's flophouse set is sleazily opulent.</p> <p>Yet there are times when Brown's research seems to be leading the action, rather than the other way round. The characters seem too aware of their historical significance, though nobody at the time would have thought jazz was more than a passing fad. Not unlike Jelly Roll's fashion for putting light bulbs at the end of his shoes - bringing delightful new meaning to the term twinkle toes.</p>",
  "<p>The apolitical nature of British policing is not only a tradition, but a great strength. The manner of Sir Ian Blair's departure yesterday raises serious questions about whether it is under threat. In a dignified statement, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police explained that his decision to quit reflected the wishes of the London mayor, Boris Johnson. That is an oddity, not least because Sir Ian's anti-terrorism role gave him a nationwide role, beyond the capital. Indeed, the mayor has no formal power to order the commissioner to go. But as he prepares to take the chair of the Metropolitan police authority, something the London mayor has not done before, Mr Johnson clearly had the capacity to make life difficult. He may have said as much. More alarming are allegations that his aides believed that they might delay the appointment of a successor until a Conservative home secretary was in place.</p> <p>If if is true that Mr Johnson and his team were prepared to take such a partisan approach towards policing, then it is a very grave worry. That is so, even though Sir Ian himself might reasonably be charged with stepping into the political mire too often. More than once - over 90-day detention without trial and over ID cards - he has risked compromising his professional independence by taking the government's side on divisive questions. But using political office to affect top appointments in the force is no way to reintroduce the desirable distance between policing and politics.</p> <p>None of this is to deny that there was a powerful case for Sir Ian stepping aside in the not too distant future. The immediate backdrop to yesterday's news was revelations about the questionable manner in which a company owned by a friend of Sir Ian had won a contract for Met-funded work. The commissioner should have better understood that, for top public managers, acting without fairness or favour is not enough - they must also be seen to act that way. Sir Ian has found grave difficulties in building a loyal team. Infighting and briefing have long been part of Scotland Yard's culture, and he was never going to be able to stamp that out - especially when he was up against strong reactionary currents, who yearned for less culturally challenging days. But even those who should have been allies often were not - as a baffling series of legal rows with senior minority-ethnic officers showed.</p> <p>The most intractable of all Sir Ian's difficulties, however, can be traced back to the 2005 shooting at Stockwell of the unarmed Brazillian, Jean Charles de Menezes. The terrible fact of the death was no reason for Sir Ian to go. It took place at a moment when the police were operating under extraordinary strain - two weeks before terrorists had claimed dozens of lives, and only hours before they had sought to do the same. These are exactly the sort of circumstances in which terrible mistakes will happen. But Sir Ian's position was undermined by what happened following on from the shooting, including the way he responded to news of the shooting by telling the Home Office that the Independent Police Compliants Commission should not be allowed to investigate.</p> <p>As a true progressive within the police, Sir Ian belongs to a breed that is too rare. His determination to forge a force that better reflected the city it served was commendable, as was his practical record in delivering on neighbourhood policing. As Mr Johnson and the home secretary pointed out yesterday, crime fell during the period of his office. The bungled response to Stockwell meant that before long Mr Blair might well soon have had to go. But how much better it would have been for him to depart on an issue of policing, rather than on issues of politics. There may be satisfaction in some conservative circles at seeing an unpopular liberal policeman bounced out of office by a Tory mayor. But by his actions Mr Johnson has set a disturbing precedent.</p>",
  "<p>It is a comfort to know that some traditions never change. Trains still run reliably late, summers are still soggy - and doctors are always men. Three years ago a reader, Dr Joanna Smith, found that she had been given a sex change on her airline ticket. Her travel company, Airtours, explained that its computers only recognised men as doctors and that if she wanted to reclaim her femininity she would have to be a Mrs. </p> <p>Another reader, Dr Martha Caddell, chuckled wryly when I referred to the case recently. Then she went to book a holiday online with First Choice. A company representative called to confirm the gender of the two Drs on the booking; nevertheless when the travel documents arrived Caddell had become a man. She telephoned to request a correction and was sent a second set of tickets. This time someone had scribbled a pen mark in the female box while an official printed star remained defiantly in the male one. Concerned that her now dual gender might be queried at check-in Caddell rang again. This time she was told that if she insisted on being female she would have to travel as a Ms. \"I'm pretty shocked that something as basic as this can still occur,\" she says. \"When was the First Choice computer system designed?\" </p> <p>First Choice tells me that anyone who books under the androgynous title of Dr will be contacted to confirm their gender because the law requires it to be specified on travel documents. The Department of Transport has never heard of such a law and First Choice then finds there isn't one. It apologises for the \"misinformation\" and \"confusion\" and says: \"We're doing all we can to make this process simpler moving forwards [sic].\" The happy news is that the company is sweating over its computer programmes and hopes that by summer 2009, female postgraduates will be able to travel as doctors.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Send your consumer grievances to Dear Anna, at Shopping, 3rd Floor, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER email <a href=\"mailto:consumer@theguardian.com\">consumer@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>As an active Holocaust denier is apprehended at Heathrow, we look ahead to one of the literary events of the year, the first book in six years from David Irving. We receive an advance copy and some glossy publicity about our favourite historian. No reviews are possible until October 19, but we can tell you that Banged Up - his account of 14 months spent in an Austrian jail for Holocaust denial - is everything one might expect from him. If you have tears to shed, now's the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Just as engaging is the publicity material that features a photograph of Mr Justice Gray, who presided over the libel trial involving Irving and the US historian Professor Deborah Lipstadt in 2000. Irving lost, but in a lengthy judgment the judge said many things, and the writer quotes a few of them. \"As a military historian Irving has much to commend him,\" the judge said. \"He is beyond question able and intelligent ... his knowledge of world war two is unparalleled.\" But Mr Justice Gray said much else in his judgment that is not reproduced here. It was \"incontrovertible\" that Irving qualified as a Holocaust denier, the judge concluded. \"Not only has he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz and asserted that no Jew was gassed there, he has done so on frequent occasions and sometimes in the most offensive terms.\" There were in fact soundbites galore. \"Irving has repeatedly crossed the divide between legitimate criticism and prejudiced vilification of the Jewish race and people\". And \"the picture of Irving which emerges from the evidence of his extra-curricular activities reveals him to be a rightwing pro-Nazi polemicist\". Perhaps the most relevant quote addressed Irving's political agenda, \"which, it is legitimate to infer, disposes him, where he deems it necessary, to manipulate the historical record in order to make it conform with his political beliefs\". Or perhaps My Lord, to flog a book? </p> <p>\u2022 In this new age of seriousness, when serious people are saying serious things about serious challenges, might one usefully reflect on the way things have been for the past decade? The publication next week of Adam Boulton's new book, Tony's Ten Years, will shine a light on the disreputable things that were done by way of news management, the Campbell phenomenon and the dark era of spin. Examples abound, but each of us has a favourite, and reader Phil Grierson gets in touch to give us his. It was 1998, and he was responsible for organising a youth event in Birmingham. Young delegates were selected to question the prime minister. \"Immediately prior to this meeting, one of the youth delegates expressed concern to me about having been approached to ask a specific question relating to a recent shooting in Northern Ireland,\" Grierson recalls. \"It was unclear who had made this attempt to plant the question, except that it had been made by an unidentified woman, and I advised the delegate to ignore it and ask the prime minister what she had planned to ask him, which she duly did.\" After the meeting he talked with Anji Hunter, Blair's gatekeeper, who \"agreed with me that it had been a successful meeting, with the single proviso that 'her' question about Northern Ireland had not been asked by the female delegate she'd approached\"! Of course one can hardly think that Anji Hunter, aka Mrs Adam Boulton, would recall one such episode of minor chicanery. They happened all the time.</p> <p>\u2022 Now we finally understand the need to make our presence felt in Darfur, the question is, how can we help? What are the priorities? Chief of the Sudanese police force in North Darfur, General Ahmad Atta Al Mannan Othman, tells the UN that the peacekeeping mission's main problem is not the lack of helicopters or troops, but rather the dearth of insurance company officials to deal with road collisions. But an airlift of suits? Just doesn't seem right.</p> <p>\u2022 Meanwhile, our inquiries into Barack Obama and his \"links\" to radical Islam lead us to this from Conservapedia, the resource for US rightwingers. \"He uses the Muslim Pakistani pronunciation for 'Pakistan' rather than the common American one,\" it tells us. \"Obama repeatedly pronounced 'Pakistan' as 'Pokiston'.\" Does Sarah Palin know? This is dynamite.</p> <p>\u2022 Congrats to the government car and dispatch agency, named Public Sector Fleet of the Year in the prestigious GreenFleet awards. The judges were impressed - and little wonder, for in a less perfect world ministers might struggle to travel the 200 yards or so from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to parliament. Des Browne would have 300 yards to walk from the MoD. Gordon 150.

  "<p>We will look back on the banking crisis of September 2008 as a defining moment for economic globalisation. It may have started in the US mortgage market and on Wall Street, but through an integrated global economy it has become an international problem. Whatever our response, we should be guided by two principles. First, we should not jettison our commitment to globalisation. Second, a global economy needs global governance. </p> <p>Globalisation works by widening economic networks. It multiplies the sizes of markets, increases the economies of scale that push down prices, and allows countries to tap into sources of productive investment from around the world. Those networks have created a global economic engine that is the biggest eliminator of poverty and creator of opportunity the world has ever seen. But globalisation transmits risk and volatility as well as benefits. </p> <p>Sustaining the huge benefits of economic globalisation relies on preserving these fundamental networks of interdependence, not rolling them back. Changes to financial regulatory frameworks must tackle excessive risk while defending open trade and foreign investment as vital to development. </p> <p>Beyond ending the liquidity crisis, our first response should be to fix the source of the shock. We need to inject confidence by regulating to control excessive risk-taking and heavy leveraging, and to improve the way ratings agencies work. The European commission is right to now come forward with new European rules on these questions. Certain financial products have become so complex that they are not understood by the very institutions that buy and trade them. This is a regulatory and professional failure of the first order.</p> <p>Politicians need to recognise that national solutions are only half the solution. For years, financial markets have been global more than national, yet they operate with limited multilateral coordination or governance. Asset bubbles in one market can have serious consequences in another. The effects of monetary or currency policy are easily exported. Yet the machinery of global economic governance barely exists. </p> <p>Mechanisms for cross-border cooperation in Europe exist but they are incomplete. The rescue package for Dutch financial group Fortis showed European governments can act quickly to limit damage. But the Benelux states that stepped in to help the group have close ties and habits of cooperation. Guarantees for Irish banks have proved more politically complex. The general mechanisms of European coordination must be strengthened so governments and regulators act effectively to address the fact that many financial institutions operate across borders. </p> <p>Internationally, the problem is even more acute. There is no institution with a mandate or real capacity to assess systemic risk in financial markets. There is no institution empowered to speak from the perspective of global economic interdependence and to counsel states on the global picture. Coordination mechanisms among central bankers and regulators exist, but they are weak. </p> <p>They are also skewed towards an economic order that is increasingly outdated. The large emerging economies - especially China - are growing sources of capital and economic demand. They are tightly knit into the global economy. Bodies like the G8 simply do not reflect this changing economic architecture. Effective multilateral governance of the global economy will require institutions that do. It is 64 years since the Bretton Woods conference put in place the basic machinery of modern global economic coordination. It is time for a Bretton Woods for this century.</p> <p>It has always been a mistake to believe that globalisation was putting governments out of business. States and effective governance are what makes globalisation possible: they preserve open markets, enforce rules and responsibilities, and manage the risks for individuals and society. We have been reminded over the past two weeks that the state underpins the market as lender of last resort. But it has a legitimate claim to a wider role. Its role is to ensure that the conduct of individuals or businesses does not put at risk the stability of the system or the foundations of our economies. </p> <p>We have nothing to gain by shutting down financial globalisation. But the networks that make up globalisation will keep transmitting the shocks along with the benefits unless we take a tougher line with excessive risk, and strengthen the multilateral instruments that govern the global financial system. </p> <p>If there is anything cathartic in this crisis it will be a healthy new scepticism for financial products we don't understand, a heightened intolerance for excessive risk-taking, and a new conviction that a global economy needs global economic governance. </p> <p>\u2022 Peter Mandelson is EU trade commissioner <br><a href=\"mailto:peter.mandelson@ec.europa.eu\">peter.mandelson@ec.europa.eu</a></p>",
  "<p>She's back. The Mona Lisa of the modern age, Vermeer's Girl With a Pearl Earring, is in town again and kicking up a storm. As a result, members of the Catharina Vermeer admiration society must take up arms once more to defend their heroine. After the novel by Tracy Chevalier and the lush Scarlett Johansson movie comes a stage play by David Joss Buckley at London's Haymarket. The story is the same mix of sex, jealousy and frowning moodiness amid the paint pots and varnish. If I were Vermeer, I would sue.</p> <p>Chevalier and I share a fixation with Johannes Vermeer. When the last of his few works ever likely to come to auction appeared at Sotheby's in April 2004, we went along to fantasise. She sat on her hands, but I recklessly placed the first bid, something astronomical. Mercifully the painting, Young Woman Seated at the Virginals, went to Steve Wynn, casino operator of Las Vegas, the man who had an unfortunate accident with his Picasso.</p> <p>As for the girl, Chevalier and I disagree. I cannot see her as Vermeer's seductive acolyte, supplanting Catharina and playing girlish tricks on the way to the paint shop. To me she is one of his pre-teen daughters, Maria or Elizabeth, dressed up to look exotic as Vermeer loved, in oriental costume and with her mother's jewel in her ear.</p> <p>We know so little about this painter that writers assume a licence to stray from even plausible conjecture into pure fiction. Knowing little is not nothing. Some 200 books have been written about Vermeer, including research into his family by the critics Pieter Swillens and Malraux and the American sleuth, John Montias.</p> <p>Vermeer's marriage to Catharina in 1653 was manifestly one of love, a Protestant to a Catholic and against both families' wishes. He had to leave his neighbourhood and was erased from the civic records, moving into the house of his mother-in-law, Maria Thins, in what was known as Delft's \"Papists' Corner\". There he ran an art dealership and acted as family rentier.</p> <p>There is every sign that the family was happy. Catharina was to be pregnant throughout their 22-year marriage, with 11 of their 15 children surviving. Vermeer named them after his mother-in-law, Maria, and her favourite saints (including Ignatius and Franciscus). She made him her heir in preference to her own son. When he died bankrupt at the age of 43, Maria referred to him as \"the sainted Vermeer\". Catharina pleaded with the executors to let her keep three of her favourite paintings, one almost certainly of her and the others, I believe, of their girls. None of this suggests a frigid, jilted canvas-slasher.</p> <p>Archival research has uncovered enough about Vermeer's household to indicate a close-knit home, full of children and music. Vermeer, though trained and in the artists' guild, earned little from painting and stopped altogether during the crash of 1672 to concentrate on making money.</p> <p>Only some three dozen authenticated pictures survive, and experts think it unlikely there were many more. There were no pupils, no studio, no sketches, no notebooks or etchings. The modest family possessions, many depicted in the paintings, were listed on the artist's death and offer many clues to his lifestyle.</p> <p>That Vermeer painted slowly and intermittently suggests that he had neither the time nor the money to use professional models. Besides, he had no need. He was surrounded by them. The residents of his house were Catharina, her mother, possibly her brother, innumerable children and the maid, Tanneke Everpoel.</p> <p>The idea that Vermeer painted \"ideal\" faces is denied by the clear presence of Tanneke in four paintings, including The Milkmaid, with her robust Dutch face, muscled arms and brown costume. The artist's friend, Anton van Leeuwenhoek (whose appearance is known from other portraits) appears to have been the model for both The Astronomer and The Geographer.</p> <p>Hence there is no reason to doubt the identity of the mistress of the house, so often portrayed as pregnant, reading letters and toying with jewels. And if she is Catharina, why should the girls so ubiquitous in the pictures not be her daughters, of whom Maria and Elizabeth were between 11 and 13 when the pearl earring picture is dated, in 1665-7?</p> <p>The girls all bear the distinctive Vermeer look - high-browed, wide-eyed, with straight nose and strong jaw, quite unlike Tanneke. The girl in The Art of Painting, also in fancy dress, looks identical to the earring girl with her oriental headdress. Why go to the trouble of inventing an unknown servant, Griet, with a gloomy, defamatory story round her, for this one painting?</p> <p>Chevalier adheres to the modernist thesis that whenever a female gives what might be thought a meaningful look it must imply sex. This girl's moist, slightly open mouth is said to indicate physical allure, stimulating acclaim for its eroticism and sensuality. Some have even renamed it The Art of Seduction.</p> <p>They allege that the mouth holds the key, despite the fact that a mere turning of the head can draw the lips apart. As a result, says Chevalier, the look holds \"a bewitching ambiguity, balanced between innocence and experience, fear and desire, loss and gain ... a look so intimate that she clearly knew the painter well\". Knew, yes, but then she would if she were his daughter.</p> <p>Does any of this matter? Not really, and Chevalier's book is a delight. But I remain unnerved by fiction's relentless abuse of history, as if \"real\" invention is no longer up to the job of packing a literary punch. There must be a difference between intelligent deduction and pure make-believe.</p> <p>Despite his unconventional marriage, Vermeer became a bourgeois burgher of Delft, not a Bohemian artist. I see no improbability in the view that he delighted in spending his spare time making music and painting Catharina and their children. This construction may be boring and hopeless for Hollywood or the West End, but it is the closest we are likely to get to a picture of the historical man.</p> <p>Half the fun of history may lie in each generation reinterpreting works of art through new eyes and new views of human nature. But Vermeer will now and forever be known as a sex-mad garret artist. So spare a thought for poor Catharina. To Proust she embodied Vermeer's \"withdrawal into silence\". To Montias she was \"a pensive woman pent up in shallow space\". Chevalier has her howling at her husband, \"Why have you never painted me!\"</p> <p>I see her as quite different, as a beautiful woman, one of the most beguiling in all art, who suffered much for love and faith. Her image and that of her daughter now lie sacrificed on the altar of theatrical sex.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's campaign is receiving increasing complaints about scam pollsters involved in dirty tricks operations to discredit the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Victims claim the fake pollsters insinuate into their questions information, often untrue, designed to damage Obama.</p> <p>Those targeted in swing states such as Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania include Jews, Christian evangelicals, Catholics and Latinos.</p> <p>One of those who have protested, Debbie Minden, who lives in a predominantly Jewish neighbourhood, Squirrel Hill in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said that the pollster had begun by asking her the usual questions about her background and who she would vote for.</p> <p>But the pollster went on to ask Minden, who is Jewish, how she would vote if she knew that Obama was supported by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that runs Gaza and was responsible for most of the suicide bombings against Israel.</p> <p>\"It is scare tactics. It is terribly underhand,\" she said.</p> <p>The groups behind such polls have not been identified.</p> <p>One of the Republican groups working on behalf of John McCain's campaign, the Republican Jewish Coalition, acknowledges carrying out a survey about Jewish voters' views on Obama and Israel but insists it had been a legitimate exercise intended to test campaign messages on Jewish voters.</p> <p>The RJC angrily dismissed comparisons between its exercise and so-called push polling, the technique of using fake surveys to sway voters. </p> <p>Its poll was restricted to 750 people whereas push polls usually involve phoning thousands. It asked 82 questions, only 10% of which were devoted to Obama.</p> <p>The technique of push polling is part of the election battle being fought on the ground in the swing states where the margins of victory have been narrow in past elections. On a bigger scale, teams from each campaign are engaged in legal fights over who is entitled to vote, with Republican groups trying to have people in largely Democratic neighbourhoods disqualified.</p> <p>Push polling was used with stunning effect in the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina when an organisation claiming to be pollsters insinuated that McCain, then fighting George W Bush for the party nomination, had illegitimately fathered a black child. </p> <p>Bush overturned McCain's double-digit poll lead, and the origin of the calls was never fully established.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the tactic surfaced again during the Republican <br>primaries when calls were made highlighting the religion of one of the candidates, Mitt Romney - he is a Mormon, a religion viewed with suspicion by some on the Christian right.</p> <p>An Obama campaign organiser in one of the swing states, who is not authorised to speak on the record, said there had been lots of complaints about push polling in his patch. </p> <p>Callers said questions frequently included a reference to the widespread belief that Obama is a Muslim, even though he has repeatedly said he is a Christian.</p> <p>The organiser said another question was: would you be less likely to vote for Obama if Israel had to give up all of Jerusalem? \"They make this shit up. They are good at it. The unassuming listener will not realise it is untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>Minden, a school psychologist, received a call on a Sunday afternoon in the middle of last month.</p> <p>Living in a swing state, she was not surprised to be polled. \"It sounded like a normal poll. Was I voting? Demographics? Age? Where we live? Then a question about which party I supported, who I preferred on the economy, on foreign policy, questions like that.</p> <p>\"They said; 'Are you Jewish?' and I said 'Yeh'. Then they said 'if you knew Barack Obama was supported by Hamas, would it change your vote? Would it change your vote if you knew his church had made anti-Semitic statements?' All the hot button issues on Israel.\"</p> <p>She said she will vote for Obama as planned. \"This had no influence,\" she said.</p> <p>In Key West, Florida, another swing state, Joelna Marcus, a retired professor, had a similar experience. She was asked if she would be influenced if she learned that Obama had donated money to the Palestine Liberation Organisation.</p> <p>Marcus has since disconnected her phone.</p> <p>The Huffington Post website reported that a reader named Rachel from Strongsville, Ohio, complained of a push poll that portrayed Obama as a radical left-winger who had voted to let convicted child sex offenders out early and to allow them to live near schools. </p> <p>Similar poll questions were reported by another reader on Marc Ambinder's Atlantic website.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/02/ian.blair.resigns\">resignation</a> takes the Met \u2013 and Britain \u2013 one step closer to being governed in the manner of Sarah Palin, the candidate who stands accused of firing her own appointee as state police commissioner in a personal vendetta. From the vantage point of an American who has worked closely with Blair and other British police leaders, the UK would suffer immensely from any further loss of what made British police the best in the world: their fealty to the rule of law, rather than politics. </p> <p>The American practice of allowing politicians to dismiss police executives has been a disaster. London's police have, from their earliest days in 1830, been a far greater success than the copycat forces soon created in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. While London police were led by professional commissioners with life tenure, American police were all subject to dismissal by urban political machines. Many things have changed since those days, but the basic culture of an independent police in Britain has not \u2013 or not yet. </p> <p>Opinions will differ about whether Blair's resignation is an undeserved finale for one of the most effective leaders in Met history \u2013 my own view \u2013 or a victory for democratic control of policing. American police chiefs are used to being fired every two years or so as political sacrifices. The police commissioner of one of America's largest cities told me last week that \"my colleagues and I can all be fired tomorrow. That's the way we live. Get over it.\"</p> <p>That is not how British police chiefs have lived \u2013 least of all the Metropolitan commissioners, who from 1829 to 1999 enjoyed judicial independence as justices of the peace. That independence has been so central to British rule of law that we can scarcely conceive of an alternative. Even the controversial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/apr/03/conservatives.ukcrime\">Tory plan</a> to elect commissioners guarantees the independence of their chief constables.</p> <p>When Labour created an elected <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/\">mayor for London</a> in 1999, many observers wondered what that would mean for police independence. Instead of serving only the home secretary, the Met's commissioner now reports to a local police authority as well, with strong input from the mayor. It was not long before firing a police commissioner became a key issue in the mayoral race. Yet doing so has broken the social contract on which the Met was founded. </p> <p>In selling the Tory plan to create the Met in 1829, Sir Robert Peel assured the opposition Whigs that the police would not be used to the political advantage of one party over another. Yet when Whigs took office, their home secretary ordered plainclothes police to spy on political meetings. He also ordered police to repress an anti-government rally, at which a constable was killed \u2013 and his killers were acquitted on grounds that police acted illegally. </p> <p>The first police commissioners, who had tried to resist such Home Office orders, used the ensuing controversies to win a statute that established their independence from political direction more firmly. Later commissioners continued to struggle with the Home Office over policy and even operations. Yet no commissioner was ever publicly removed from office because of the way they led <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\">Scotland Yard</a>. The idea seemed as unthinkable as dismissing a lord chief justice over an opinion - at least until the creation of the London mayor in 1999. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/history/index.htm\">Never before</a> has the Metropolitan police commissioner been judged like a cabinet minister, with an implied duty to step down or be pushed when things are not going well. </p> <p>Where countries have created police ministers, as in Australia and more recently in the UK, they have preserved independent terms of office for the professional police executives. So while police ministers may serve short-term political considerations, a police executive can plan the best policies for the long run. Many variations on this theme can be developed, from elected police \"commissioners\" replacing police authorities (and preserving professional police executives) to an elected criminal justice commissioner who integrates police, prosecution, prison and probation in each area. </p> <p>If British people want more democratic control of the police, they can certainly have it. But they will be sorry if they \"fix\" a British system of independent police executives with an American solution of having mayors call police chiefs five times a day to give them orders (as Philadelphia's last mayor did). Whether or not Sarah Palin goes to Washington, let's hope we can keep her style of governance far away from London.</p>",
  "<p>Whoever wins the American presidential election next month, there will be a dope smoker in the White House next year. Both <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=cpBzQI_7ez8\">Barack Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/29/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4397109.shtml\">Sarah Palin</a> have admitted that, in their youth, they smoked marijuana. British politicians are also becoming marginally franker about their own use of the drug, although the standard term is to \"experiment\" with cannabis; strangely, no-one talks about their student days \"experimenting\" with beer and wine.</p> <p>One might have thought that with so many politicians on both sides of the Atlantic having \"experimented\" and lived to tell the tale, that there would be a more receptive response to attempts to address the place of cannabis in the law. This week, the respected Beckley Foundation has published the report of its <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/policy/cannabis_commission.html\">global cannabis commission</a>, compiled by an international team of acknowledged experts on the issue, and its findings make intriguing reading.</p> <p>The thrust of the report, presented in the House of Lords yesterday, is that there is urgent need for a debate to move beyond the stalemate we have now reached. As the report suggests, although cannabis can have a negative impact on health, including mental health, in terms of relative harm, it is considerably less damaging than alcohol or tobacco. While there have only been two deaths worldwide attributed to cannabis, alcohol and tobacco together are responsible for an estimated 150,000 deaths per annum in the UK alone.</p> <p>Yet more than half the arrests for drugs worldwide are for minor cannabis offences and, suggests the commission, the damage done by the criminalising these minor offenders, drawing them into the criminal world and using the time and resources of the justice system to do so, appears to far outweigh the medical and societal damage.</p> <p>The lead author of the report, Professor Robin Room, spelled out the potential areas for discussion and the options for regulation of the drug. He was not advocating legalisation but merely asking for politicians to engage with the actual research that exists. For instance, the lowering of cannabis from a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/oct/24/drugsandalcohol\">class B to a class C drug</a> in the UK did not have the effect of increasing its use, despite the parroted claims that it would \"send the wrong message\". In fact, the opposite happened, which makes the government's current plans to reverse the reclassification even more baffling.</p> <p>There is ample evidence that regulation and education work for drugs: in 1950, 80% of men smoked tobacco, now the figure is around 30%, thanks to a mixture of information, taxation and restriction. But neither the government nor the Conservative party dare to discuss the issue and only the Liberal Democrats and the Greens will address what is one of the most important issues facing us. Instead, we follow the bellicose call from across the Atlantic for a \"war on drugs\" as misdirected and misinformed as the \"war on terror\".</p> <p>The global cannabis commission report contains much that would aid the debate. Let's hope that at least some of our politicians \"experiment\" with it.</p>",
  "<p>The row with the London mayor, Boris Johnson, may have given Sir Ian Blair an opportunity to depart as commissioner of the Metropolitan police without going directly as a result of a scandal or controversy.</p> <p>Controversy after controversy had left him weakened. But it was not scandals past that were the biggest danger to Blair, namely the De Menezes killing and the race row plaguing the Yard. It was the criticism to come over corruption allegations that left him weak to a point where the Tory mayor could pick him off. </p> <p>It all added up to a situation where Blair's demise was increasingly not a matter of if, but when, he would become the first commissioner in modern times to be ousted from office.</p> <p>Blair seemed to have more than an inkling of his demise back in July, when he warned the post of commissioner was becoming increasingly politicised. Speaking at a regular monthly press briefing, he said that plans by Johnson to take more control of the force could ultimately be damaging.</p> <p>Blair said he was aware that Johnson was elected in May on a platform of wanting the power to hire and fire the commissioner, in order to make policing more accountable.</p> <p>The commissioner said such a move could be a \"poor bargain\" for the Met, because it had national functions, in leading the police fight against terrorism, as well as an international role. </p> <p>Blair said: \"Most senior officers are concerned that the office of commissioner is becoming a matter for high politics, which it has been for quite some time.\"</p> <p>His comments came immediately after it was revealed that a top Conservative close to Johnson had wanted to suspend the commissioner over allegations of cronyism and corruption.</p> <p>The biggest and most consistent cloud over Blair for the past three years has been the shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes in July 2005. Blair has been criticised for his handling of the shooting, and making a bad situation worse.</p> <p>But the biggest threat to Blair had become the contracts issue. He was under formal investigation over the awarding of \u00a33m worth of police contracts to a close personal friend of his. Blair thought it was enough that he had openly declared his relationship with the businessman. But the commissioner's closest allies, including those who have publicly supported him, believed the contracts issue was toxic and potentially fatal. </p> <p>It emerged that Blair had a sat on a panel that awarded the contract, and it was believed the official report would criticise the commissioner's judgment when completed either later this year, or early next. There was all this damage, despite even his biggest enemies accepting Blair had not personally benefited by a single penny.</p> <p>Blair did face a hostile rightwing press determined to get him, but he also became bereft of supporters, in government and at the top of his own force. One senior police officer yesterday said: \"The home secretary could have refused his resignation.\"</p> <p>The Labour government stuck by him, in part because his commissionership did see crime fall, in part because they did not want to hand his scalp to their Tory opponents. Months after he started as commissioner, Blair talked to the Guardian about the challenges of the job: \"You don't come into here without a pair of copper-bottomed trousers. This is a very tough place.\"</p> <p>Recently he was heard to say he did not realize how \"copper bottomed\" his trousers would need to be. Nor must he have realised how much he would contribute to his own demise.</p>",
  "<p>There's a serendipitous symmetry about this debate: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/1\">Is the future Conservative?</a> For the first time in years an un-word that had disappeared from modern times, like gasmasks and typewriters, is once again on our lips. Capitalism.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/gordon_brown_conference\">Gordon Brown's speech</a> at the Labour party conference was coy: he alluded to what should be called a \"crisis of capitalism' without using the words. He couldn't, of course, because Labourism is implicated in a love that dare not speak its name; it's fatalistic ardour for capitalism positions it as part of the problem, not the solution. That does not mean that the future is Conservative, even though it might have looked like that all but a week or so ago. </p> <p>The crisis of capitalism is as unsettling for Conservative fortunes in the UK as it is in the US. The Conservatives have at least come out: it's capitalism, they said at the party conference in Birmingham. Well, not capitalism as a system, but casino capitalism, coarse, crass, greedy betting-shop capitalism.</p> <p>As we emerge from these conferences in the midst of a global economc tsunami, we are reminded of the idiosyncracy of English politics \u2013 Dave's resort to the race card and old-fashioned right-offness, and Gordon's misty blether about fairness. And both of them blame the problem of inexcusable mass poverty on the poor. What is so enervating about all this is its irrelevance, its estrangement from my pre-occupations, yours, and more importantly the experience of the many millions of people whose societies are framing the future.</p> <p>The proletarianisation of Asia, the combustion of the Middle East, the rise and fall and rise of Eastern Europe, the ravishing tumult of Latin America, the dying of Africa \u2013 all this in the context on a perceived crisis of global capitalism \u2013 should change the terms of our national conversation. For only two decades capitalism has been given a free hand to roam the world, and in doing its thing, unrestrained, it has brought the world to the brink.</p> <p>Conservatism may own the future: it looks as if it does. But it doesn't control it. That does not mean that <a href=\"http://www.progressive-governance.net/\">progressive politics</a>, on a global scale, is currently positioned to seize the time. It is still gravely wounded by socialism's own conjunctural crises \u2013 the cruelty and <a href=\"http://www.raleightavern.org/lovell.htm\">collapse of Bolshevism and state collectivism</a>; social democracy's creation in the image of myopic men's movements masquerading as a labour movement.<br> Despite their considerable achievements, these 20th century experiments were surprisingly brief and unsustainable. They didn't resolve the structural sexism, the colonialism, the oppressions that infuse modernity's faustian grandeur. Nowhere has the tragedy of class as a social relationship \u2013 rather than merely the patois of local, subaltern cultures \u2013 been resolved. </p> <p>And everywhere wars are being waged that sponsor counter-insurgencies that, in turn, release macho mayhem, rape and pillage. The dilemma of our conjuncture is the mighty crisis of capitalism and the disorientation of progressive politics, largely bereft of the means of mass organisation. And yet, and yet \u2026 progressives interested in a dynamic, inventive, cooperative, democratic and egalitarian esprit \u2013 didn't create this conjuncture, but it is the moment we have been waiting for. </p> <p>This autumn, Comment is free and Soundings will continue the debate about our political future with a series of public debates, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/1\">Who owns the Progressive Future?</a> at the Guardian's new home in Kings Place.

  "<p>While Sir Ian Blair may have insisted his resignation today was \"in the best interests\" of London and the police service, many are interpreting it as a simple political sacking.</p> <p>Explaining the reasons behind Blair's exit, London's mayor, Boris Johnson, spoke warmly of the Metropolitan police head and said the pair had \"agreed to give someone else the chance to offer new leadership\".</p> <p>But Johnson's predecessor, Ken Livingstone, a firm supporter of Blair during his time at city hall, said he saw an entirely different motive.</p> <p>\"I think this is a political decision and in that sense I regret it,\" Livingstone told Sky News. \"The long-term legacy of this political decision will be bad for policing.\"</p> <p>\"The mayor has made no real effort to build a working relationship,\" he said.</p> <p>\"During the [mayoral] campaign he said he had no confidence in Sir Ian Blair at a time when he had no working encounter with him whatsoever, and then broadly ran against the police, claiming crime was going up and we were going to be murdered on the streets.</p> <p>\"I think that is a very bad position to start with, I don't think a mayor should run against the police.\"</p> <p>The job should not be \"a political appointment\", Livingstone said, adding: \"You want a good copper who can actually bring crime down not someone you feel politically is closer to your viewpoint.\"</p> <p>This sentiment was backed by Brian Paddick a former deputy assistant commissioner in the Met who went on to be the Liberal Democrat's 2008 mayoral candidate.</p> <p>\"This is a sad day for policing,\" he said. \"If my understanding is correct that Sir Ian really has resigned because the mayor himself has said he has no confidence in him then I think that is not a good step.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Ian Blair was seen as a reformer, somebody who was pro-diversity and he certainly set out to take the Metropolitan police in the direction I think it needed to go. He was unable to take others with him and was unable to deliver on those promises.\"</p> <p>While Livingstone had been staunch in his support for Blair, even when he faced severe criticism over the 2005 shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes by anti-terrorism officers, Johnson was different.</p> <p>The commissioner's predicament became plain at this week's Conservative party conference, where the new mayor of London expressed his frustration that he lacked the power to sack Britain's most senior officer. That remains the prerogative of the Queen, acting on the recommendation of the home secretary.</p> <p>Johnson, who takes over as chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority next month, said: \"I'm not proposing to intervene in day-to-day operations but if the mayor is to hold the police to account and if the mayor is to be held accountable for crime in London as he or she must be, then that means having proper power of appointment over the commissioner.\"</p> <p>Back in May, shortly before his election, Johnson said he was encouraged by his first meeting with Blair. </p> <p>But at the same time he was critical of the commissioner's policing techniques and accused Blair of being too political and focusing too much on minor crime such as nuisance teenagers on buses.</p> <p>In July, following his installation as mayor, leaked emails revealed that a top aide to Johnson had been advised legally that Johnson would have no power to suspend Blair.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, today announced that he is to step down after losing the support of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Blair said he would have liked to continue as Britain's most senior policeman until his contract expired in 2010. But he said that at a meeting yesterday Johnson had told him in a \"pleasant but determined\" way that he wished to see a \"change of leadership\".</p> <p>\"Without the mayor's backing I do not think I can continue in the job,\" Blair told a news conference.</p> <p>Johnson paid tribute to Blair's record in cutting crime in London but said it was time for \"new leadership\" in the force.</p> <p>The mayor said there was \"no particular story or allegation that was uppermost in our considerations.</p> <p>\"He and I agreed that this was an opportunity \u2013 with me taking over the Metropolitan Police Authority chairmanship \u2013 for a clean break and a new start for policing in London.\"</p> <p>Blair has faced pressure to step down over a number of issues, most notably the botched anti-terrorism operation in July 2005 which saw a Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, shot dead by police who mistook him for a potential suicide bomber.</p> <p>Johnson's predecessor, Ken Livingstone, backed the police chief resolutely, but the new mayor was always lukewarm in his support, making Blair's position ultimately untenable.</p> <p>Blair, who was appointed as commissioner in 2005, defended his record as the head of the Met and said it was the duty of the commissioner to lead the force \"through good times and bad\".</p> <p>He said he would leave the job on December 1 after the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, had \"reluctantly but graciously\" accepted his resignation.</p> <p>Smith said she had accepted Blair's resignation \"with regret\" and paid tribute to his contribution to policing at a local and national level, including cuts in crime rates and tackling gun crime and terrorism.</p> <p>\"Sir Ian has always had my support,\" she said.</p> <p>She announced that Sir Paul Stephenson \u2013 the bookmakers' favourite to replace Blair - would serve as acting commissioner until his successor was appointed. Smith will appoint the new commissioner after consultations with Johnson and the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p> <p>Livingstone criticised the way the commissioner was forced from office.</p> <p>\"I think this is a political decision and in that sense I regret it. The long term legacy of this political decision will be bad for policing,\" he told Sky News.</p> <p>Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner in the Met who ran as the Liberal Democrat candidate for mayor, said it was a \"sad day\" for policing.</p> <p>However, the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, welcomed the news.</p> <p>\"We have been calling for Sir Ian to step down for almost a year,\" he said, criticising \"a serious lack of judgment about the leadership of the most important police force in Britain\".</p> <p>Blair's decision comes after allegations in today's newspapers about inappropriate use of public money in sharpening the commissioner's image.</p> <p>The Daily Mail claimed this morning that Blair employed a close friend to give him PR advice prior to taking the job. He denies acting improperly.</p> <p>Blair's problems stemmed from a series of high-profile mistakes, most notably his handling of the shooting of De Menezes in the wake of the July 2005 bomb attacks on London.</p> <p>He was criticised for an initial insistence that the shooting was \"directly linked\" to anti-terrorism operations, despite widespread worries at the time among other Met officers that an innocent man had been killed.</p> <p>The family of De Menezes, who are in London for the ongoing inquest into the 27-year-old's death, said Blair bore \"responsibility for the lies told about Jean and the cover-up by police\".</p> <p>Outside the Oval cricket ground, where the inquest is taking place, De Menezes' cousin, Erionaldo da Silva, said: \"Ian Blair should have resigned three years ago when he and his men killed the wrong man.\"</p> <p>More recently, Blair has had to deal with two high-profile cases of alleged discrimination by his force. In June, the Met's most senior Asian officer, assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, said he would sue the force for racial discrimination and victimisation.</p>",
  "<p>As search teams busied themselves combing the rugged Californian mountains for more evidence <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/usa1\">after a hiker's discovery of two identification cards and a wad of cash</a>, bloggers got on with things this morning on the web.</p> <p>There already exists quite a comprehensive body of material of the possibilities other than a straight forward plane crash to answer the unanswerable in the Fossett mystery.</p> <p>One of the favourites, is that the adventurer <a href=\"http://blog.area51.org/steve-fossett-rumored-to-be-shot-down-over-area-51\">was shot down over Area 51</a>. <br> </p> <p>Also the story about how a <a href=\"http://motls.blogspot.com/2008/10/steve-fossett-officer-saw-him.html\">Californian highway patrol officer actually saw the plane flying low near Mammoth lakes </a>and has subsequently vanished.</p> <p>Oh, and let's not forget the possibility that he was kidnapped by Islamic terrorists, because that also makes it into e bloggers list of 12 possibilities, <a href=\"http://www.motls.blogspot.com/2007/09/steve-fossett-found-died-alive-location.html\">which you can read here.</a></p> <p>On the slightly more-believable level, there is much discussion that Fossett could have faked his own death following some ill-advised business ventures, or so he could start a new life with one or other of his supposed mistresses, and that he had been squirreling money away into a secret bank account for some time.</p> <p>We can blame the British press - in some capacity - for the beginnings of the conspiracy theories, which, when tracing the trail back, appear to have started in the News of the World and been carried in the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>It published a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2462912/Adventurer-Steve-Fossett-may-have-faked-his-own-death.html\">story quoting Lieutenant Colonel Cynthia Ryan of the US civil air patrol </a>who said Fossett may have faked his own death because of personal problems or fears about his business dealings.</p> <blockquote> <p>I've been doing this search and rescue for 14 years. Fossett should have been found. It's not like we didn't have our eyes open. We found six other planes while we were looking for him. We're pretty good at what we do. </p> </blockquote> <p>Then there was the risk assessor Robert Davis, who carried out an eight-month investigation into Fossett's death.</p> <blockquote> <p>I discovered that there is absolutely no proof that Steve Fossett is actually dead. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a man who deals in facts, and I don't really care if he is alive or dead, it makes no difference to me.<br>What I am interested in is the truth - and a proper criminal investigation of this man's disappearance was never undertaken by law enforcement or officials in the state of Nevada. </p> </blockquote> <p>This was followed by an <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/into-thin-air-did-steve-fossett-fake-his-own-death-882540.html\"> all-encompassing piece in the Independent</a>, which made an interesting point about the military personnel who had helped propagate the theories.</p> <blockquote> <p>Military people are not prone to hyperbole, and Ryan's comments about the Fossett case (in an interview with the News of the World last weekend) were far from understated. </p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps the last word, then, to a blogger who claims to be a ''fellow billionaire and acquaintance\" of Fossett's, who had this to say today:</p> <blockquote> <p> You see, in the search for Fossett, every form of technology known (some unknown) to man has been employed in the search effort: satellites, radar, aerial, foot, dogs, microwave, internet, seismic, thermal scans, .... and thousands upon thousands of personnel have been involved. BUT NO FOSSETT!</p> <p>I can't help but wonder, \"is something else going on here?\"<br>There has never ever been this level of technology and manpower put into a search for anyone in history, still zilch!</p> <p>I'm no conspiracy theorist, but, you have to admit this is interesting\u2026 </p> </blockquote>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/02/police.menezes\">Sir Ian Blair's resignation</a> is a major event. Not because Blair hasn't made mistakes, which he clearly has. But because he is, in effect, the first London police chief of modern times to be sacked by a politician, London's recently elected Conservative mayor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a>. </p> <p>Blair's position had clearly become, as the jargon has it, untenable. But it had become untenable not because he was wrong but because he has been squeezed between a small and vociferous left-wing campaign against the shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> in 2005 and a much larger, much more sinister and much more powerful right-wing axis of disaffected police officers, the London Tories and, crucially, the Daily Mail.</p> <p>I don't defend Blair in every way. He played a political game and lost. There was a very strong case for him to accept the responsibility \u2014 as the man in charge of the force that shot and killed an innocent man \u2014 for the Stockwell shooting. On balance, I don't agree with that case \u2014 and I think the Brazilian government's campaign against Blair is the most monstrous hypocrisy, coming as it does from a country where police in Rio alone have shot and killed 1,300 Rio citizens, many of them children, in the past 12 months alone. But I can see the strength of the case nevertheless \u2014 police shooting is a small but lethal problem \u2014 and it is clear that the new inquest would have increased the pressure on him, to the detriment of London's policing more generally.</p> <p>I also think that Blair is a bit of a jack-the-lad with the media, not very smart in his dealings with politicians, clumsy (though not necessarily wrong) in his handling of the black and Asian officers issue, as well as (above all) being out-of-step with a lot of conservative (note the small c but a large one would not be out of place) police officers in the Scotland Yard snake pit.</p> <p>So Blair had his faults, no question. But he also had immense strengths. Above all, he understood that the Metropolitan Police had to change and modernise. Not only understood but acted on it. He did two things in particular that should have been much more widely defended than they were. The more important was the restructuring of the Met to put neighbourhood policing at the absolute forefront of its mission. This remains the single most important service issue in policing and it is deeply opposed by many in the force who care more about their perks than their duties, and who will be celebrating tonight.</p> <p>The second was to take seriously the obligations that go with being an equal opportunities employer in a multi-racial city \u2013 to remake the London police force, as it were, in the image of the communities it polices. This had to come from the top and, with Blair in charge, it did. It was also unpopular with the inherited police culture, and it is part of Blair's political failing that he managed both to offend the old guard and then parts of the new.</p> <p>Blair's critics may be right. But they completely lack a sense of police history. Until very recently, London's police were a law unto themselves, controlled only, if at all, by a Home Office that rarely picked even a small fight with the force. Historically, the Met was an alien force to Londoners, often staffed and sometimes even led by people with no community roots in the capital (particularly Scots). Until the 1980s, the Met to all intents and purposes ran itself.</p> <p>In the past 30 years that has changed. There has been a revolution in policing. And inevitably the revolutionaries are hated by those whose power they have challenged. The first revolutionary was Sir Robert Mark, Met commissioner in the 1970s, who took on the corruption culture in the force \u2014 and who was then forced to resign. Mark was hated by the canteen culture but he resigned, it should be recalled, because the Callaghan government proposed to include an independent element in the review of complaints against the police. Innocent days!</p> <p>Blair has been the second key revolutionary in the modern history of Scotland Yard (there's a case for adding Peter Imbert to the list too, I admit). But Blair has had to operate in a world of infinitely greater accountability and transparency than anything that Mark or Imbert ever knew (or would have put up with). In particular, he has been commissioner at a time when the accountability of the police has been politicised and forced to adapt to the 24/7 media world. This is not necessarily a bad change, but it is indisputably a huge one. Blair is sometimes accused of being too political but he has been the victim of a political assassination too. In the end, he has had to go because his own officers subverted him through the Daily Mail and because a Tory politician told him to quit, not because of any particular established failing of his own. </p> <p>Those on the left who are cheering Blair's departure need to think about that. Blair is the victim of a process that should give pause for thought to us all \u2014 and especially to his successor. Policing is not like other public services. It requires staff who do dangerous things to citizens as well as dangerous things for citizens. Putting politicians in charge of the police is like putting politicians in charge of judges \u2014 there is a case for it but there is also a good reason why we tend not to do it. In the end, I am strongly in favour of local accountability but this episode makes one think twice. There is a proper debate to be held about who should decide the priorities of the police and we have not had it yet. If nothing else, I look forward to hearing Sir Ian Blair's views on the subject.</p>",
  "<p>If tragedy is the downfall of an essentially good person through some fatal choice or action, then Sir Ian Blair's descent probably began shortly before the first British suicide bombers brought death and carnage to the nation three years ago.</p> <p>He was five months into his new job, a post he acknowledged required \"copper-bottomed trousers\", and appearing on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, when he boasted about the Metropolitan police's record on combating terrorism. The force, he said, was the \"gold standard\" across the world for dealing with terrorism and had \"upped\" its game to work more closely with the intelligence services than anywhere in the western world. It was 7.16am.</p> <p>Ninety minutes later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/july7\">the first of three suicide bombs</a> exploded on London underground trains within 50 seconds of each other. Nearly an hour later a fourth bomber detonated his bomb on a bus.</p> <p>If Blair did not regret immediately that moment of hubris, he must have come to. His comments were seen by his foes as an early sign of a lack of judgment - and luck - that pervaded his tenure at the Metropolitan police and eventually led to his departure.</p> <p>Unlike the heroes of Greek tragedy, Blair <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/10/politics.ukcrime\">elicits little sympathy</a> from anyone in Scotland Yard today.</p> <p>It is a remarkable collapse in support for a man who many hoped would rejuvenate a force which less than 10 years ago was branded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\">institutionally racist.</a></p> <p>\"Blair has lost his friends and supporters,\" said one former close colleague. \"Those who were not close to him but put prejudice to one side and said, 'I have to stand by him', have been put through such difficult times their support has now waned.</p> <p>\"Those who consider themselves to be friends of his, equally, have been shafted or not treated well and were also starting to question what his motives are?\"</p> <p>Another close associate drew parallels with the troubled tenure of another former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon.</p> <p>\"It's like the dying days of Condon, nothing was going to improve until Blair went. Only at least in Condon we had a statesman-like figure. Blair seemed to be too touchy and not big enough to let certain things just wash over him.\"</p> <p>Blair's reign began in February 2005. The former deputy commissioner succeeded Sir John Stevens and immediately faced extreme challenges; Islamist suicide bombers, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">fatal shooting of an innocent man</a> in a bungled anti-terror operation, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/28/race\">simmering race row</a> with senior officers and a violent youth crime problem.</p> <p>Early in his tenure Blair earned the reputation for being a New Labour lackey. Lobbying first for identity cards and later for detention for 42 days without trial, he was accused of being a mouthpiece for his namesake, the then prime minister, Tony Blair.</p> <p>Arguably the events he had to deal with were no more challenging than those faced by former commissioners from Sir Robert Mark in 1972 to Stevens before him; Irish republican terrorism, police corruption, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/04/ukcrime.rosiecowan\">the Broadwater farm riots and the murder of PC Keith Blakelock</a>, the poll tax riots and the fatal stabbing of Stephen Lawrence.</p> <p>Coming as he did after the towering figure of Stevens - the larger than life commissioner who held the loyalty of rank and file - Blair was a completely different kind of leader.</p> <p>It was always acknowledged that he was a clever politician, able to win over ministers, but support from officers was going to be harder to secure after the superhero status of Stevens.</p> <p>\"If Stevens had to give you bad news he would put his arm round your shoulders and include you and by the end of it you would agree with his decision to move you or take officers away from your unit,\" one officer said. \"But with Blair there is no small talk. When he calls you in to see you he just starts talking. When he is finished he gets up from his desk and it's time for you to go.\"</p> <p>Another associate said: \"His interpersonal skills are not good. He thinks he is good at it but actually he is not.\"</p> <p>One anecdote notorious at the Yard describes the evening Blair took a handful of senior officers to dinner to congratulate them. Some of those present recalled that he made it clear as soon as they sat down that he would only be eating a main course, so they followed his lead.</p> <p>After the main course he asked, \"Who's for coffee?\" bringing a swift end to the proceedings. When it came to the bill, Blair took the receipt, divided it up and asked them all to pay \u00a321 each. He then returned to the table carrying a handful of \u00a31 coins, and returned \u00a32 each to the officers because the service had not been inspiring enough to leave a tip.</p> <p>All of that might not have mattered had his officers believed either that he was an inspirational leader or someone they should fear. But Blair quickly gained a reputation for a lack of general judgment and a stubborn streak. Senior officers complained that he didn't listen, and he became paralysed as problems piled up.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/23/july7.uksecurity11\">shooting</a> of the Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes on July 22 2005 would have presented a challenge for any commissioner. An innocent man killed in an anti-terrorist operation that was bungled and confused from the start.</p> <p>Quite naturally in the immediate aftermath there was a degree of chaos and crisis management at the Yard. Confirmed facts were scant on the ground, the media was baying for information and there were still at least three suicide bombers on the run.</p> <p>At a press conference that afternoon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/aug/17/pressandpublishing.ttackonlondon\" \">Blair said</a>: \"The information I have available is that this shooting is directly linked to the ongoing and expanding anti-terrorist operation. Any death is deeply regrettable. I understand the man was challenged and refused to obey.\"</p> <p>None of this was confirmed at the time, and although Blair was perhaps let down by senior officers who did not brief him clearly, he also had the option of using his own judgment.</p> <p>The next day Blair continued talking, leading a senior officer to tell the Guardian: \"It is time for him to just be quiet. If you don't know the full facts, don't make out that you do.\"</p> <p>But Blair's tendency to say the wrong thing continued. In January 2006 he claimed \"almost nobody\" could understand why the 2002 murder of the two 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in Soham dominated the news headlines and became \"the biggest story in Britain\", provoking a furious response and eliciting an apology.</p> <p>Two months later it emerged he had illicitly recorded telephone conversations with several public figures, including Lord Goldsmith, the then attorney general, and senior figures within the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p> <p>He was also ridiculed for suggesting on a visit to Haringey, north London, that crime had come down so much that people were leaving their doors open or unlocked in a way they had not done for 25 years. The figures suggested otherwise - in one year 2,834 burglaries were reported to police in the borough.</p> <p>On another occasion, Blair told those attending a meeting of the Metropolitan Police Authority that vehicle-borne bombs were the greatest threat to the capital. Moments later his comments were undermined by a senior figure who told journalists privately: \"The intelligence does not stand that up.\"</p> <p>There were other embarassing moments. In a Guardian interview in 2006 Blair spoke of his experience as a young officer during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/30/iankatz.uknews4\">1975 Balcombe Street siege</a> when an IRA unit was chased to a London house. He indicated he had been shot at by the IRA, but a fellow officer questioned his version of events.</p> <p>More seriously, judgment was again crucial in the fallout from the De Menezes shooting. Blair was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/01/topstories3.menezes\">heavily criticised </a>by the IPCC for blocking their inquiry into the shooting for three days. The delays, the IPCC said, had given officers time to alter a surveillance log and allow conspiracy theories to develop about the shooting.</p> <p>When it came to the criminal prosecution of the Met under health and safety laws over the shooting, Blair, sources say, again displayed a lack of a sure touch.</p> <p>\"He was advised by several senior officers, people close to him, to plead guilty, take the beating and move on. But he insisted that we must plead not guilty in the face of opposition from all around him,\" said a senior figure.</p> <p>The Met's defence team went on to mount a brutal character assassination at the trial, suggesting De Menezes might have been high on cocaine and therefore jumpy and paranoid, that he had acted like a suicide bomber, and was aggressive and threatening. The Met released a composite picture intending to show how similar De Menezes was to the suicide bomber Hussain Osman. But it emerged the picture had been distorted, stretched or resized to create a misleading match.</p> <p>At the end of the trial the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/02/menezes.immigrationpolicy1\">Met was convicted </a>of endangering the public under health and safety legislation and Mr Justice Henriques criticised Blair's force for adopting \"an entrenched position\" in refusing to admit any failures in the operation.</p> <p>\"The thing about Blair is that for most of his career he has been a lot brighter than those around him and he has got into the habit of not listening. But he is now at a level when he should be taking advice,\" said one adviser.</p> <p>In the end, Blair's personal integrity was fatally damaged by the controversy over the awarding of \u00a33m of Met contracts to Andy Miller, a close friend and skiing companion.</p> <p>A report by the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, expected to be highly critical of Blair, was due to be delivered before the end of the year. The leak of one of the contracts under scrutiny to the Daily Mail was enough to push him to stand down.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day the crucial thing on the main contract was that he was in the room when it was awarded to his best friend, and he shouldn't have been, he should have declared an interest and left. It's extraordinary he could not see that,\" said a senior officer.</p> <p>Throughout it all, Blair continued to receive the private support of successive home secretaries as crime continued to fall. But in some areas spikes in offences were marked. Youth crime, particularly fatal knifings and shootings has increased year-on-year during his tenure and the victims are predominantly young black men in their early to mid teens. It as an unedifying context against which to view the race row simmering all summer between Blair and senior Asian officers who accuse him of discrimination.</p> <p>Blair might take some comfort as he departs in recent emails he has received from rank and file black and ethnic minority officers telling him they do not agree with the views of the National Black Police Association and are happy in their job.</p> <p>\"The great irony is that Blair was the most liberal leader we have had,\" one ethnic minority officer said. \"But in the end he wasted that, he was vulnerable and weak and exercised no control over those below him.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, today announced that he is to step down after three controversial years as Britain's most senior policeman.</p> <p>Blair's decision \u2013 understood to be his own - comes after claims in today's newspapers about inappropriate use of public money in sharpening the commissioner's image.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1066305/Met-chief-Sir-Ian-Blair-paid-friend-figure-sum-help-sharpen-image.html\">Daily Mail</a> claimed this morning that Blair employed a close friend to give him PR advice prior to taking the job. He denies acting improperly.</p> <p>Blair, once dubbed New Labour's copper, has rarely been far from criticism since becoming commissioner in February 2005. The Oxford English language and literature graduate has twice resorted to quoting Mark Twain, saying that \"reports of his demise are premature\".</p> <p>In recent months he was seen as reliant on the support of the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, and the new London mayor, Boris Johnson, to stay in his post. Blair forged a close working relationship with the former mayor, Ken Livingstone, but this week Johnson called for the mayor to have the power to hire and fire London police commissioners.</p> <p>This week Johnson took over as chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority.</p> <p>\"I think it is for the good of the Met,\" a former Metropolitan police commander, John O'Connor, told Sky News about the commissioner's likely exit. \"They have been suffering from the baggage of Ian Blair for too long. It has not done the reputation of the Met any good. He has been a lame duck for quite a long time.\"</p> <p>Analysts suggested that Blair's deputy, Sir Paul Stephenson, could be temporarily put in charge of the force. Among those tipped to succeed Blair is the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Sir Hugh Orde.</p> <p>Jenny Jones, a Green party member on the Metropolitan Police Authority, said :</p> <p>\"He hasn't helped himself. There have been lapses of judgment but the Tories have not got on well with him. I think the majority of police officers will breathe a sigh of relief that he has gone. I think they will regret that he has been hounded out of office.</p> <p>\"He put back bobbies on the beat and crime has gone down. He did incredibly well with the 7/7 bombings but then it all started to change after the shooting of De Menezes.\"</p> <p>Blair's problems have been caused in part by a series of high-profile media gaffes and also by events at the Met, the most serious of which was the shooting dead of the Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in the wake of the July 2005 bomb attacks on London.</p> <p>The commissioner was criticised after the publication of the official Independent Police Complaints Commission report into the shooting of De Menezes, which found the police operation had been marred by confusion and a lack of resources.</p> <p>The head of the IPCC went on to accuse Blair of causing much of the \"avoidable difficulty\" facing the force since the shooting.</p> <p>More recently, he has had to deal with two high-profile cases of alleged discrimination by his force. In June, the Met's most senior Asian officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, said he would sue the force for racial discrimination and victimisation.</p> <p>In 2006, Blair was forced to apologise to the families of the Soham murder victims, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. He said \"almost nobody\" could understand why the disappearance of the girls, in August 2002, had dominated the news headlines and become \"the biggest story in Britain\".</p> <p>Around \u00a315,000 of public money was paid to Andy Miller to advise Blair when he took on the job, the Daily Mail reported.</p> <p>Miller's company, Impact Plus, advised the commissioner on communications strategy and leadership style. The paper also reported Scotland Yard paid the firm more than \u00a33m over six years.</p> <p>Contracts awarded to the company are being examined by the chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Ronnie Flanagan.</p>",
  "<p>There seems to be a meme running around the slightly sweaty world of science fiction fandom to the effect that the present is moving so fast that writing fiction set in the near future is <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/75280/The-Ghosts-of-Futures-Past\">all but impossible</a>.</p> <p>Which is annoying if only because it kills my second favourite geek pub argument (after who'd win in a fight between Roy Keane and five Orcs?): which profession will be the first to be entirely replaced by robots?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is referees.

I for one am sick of hearing ex-players (who couldn't referee a kids game) telling us that \"the ref's having a good game\", or a poor game, or a nightmare.</p> <p>If these so-called experts are really good enough to rate a referee's performance, why aren't they out there refereeing? Keeping fit and active in the game they keep telling us they love? Rather than earning a dodgy crust getting fat and old while trotting out the same half dozen or so well polished opinions. (If I hear the phrases \"he won't be happy with that\" or \"he'll be thinking\" one more time, I shall scream.)</p> <p>The answer is that they know the job is too damn difficult. In most games the referee is the only person on the pitch who actually earns their appearance fee. Never mind respect \u2014 we should be treating our referees like gods.</p> <p>And yes, I have reffed. Incredibly badly. I officiated for one half of a game between showbiz hacks and the cast of the British remake of Mean Machine \u2014 which included Vinnie Jones and Razor Ruddock. And afterwards Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vaz Blackwood told me to my face that I was a \"cheating cunt\". It was not the most edifying and uplifting experience of my life, but it still gives me pause every time I hear some bloated pundit talk as if every decision was so blinding obvious that only a complete moron could possibly get one wrong.</p> <p>I'm not talking about the abuse refs get from fans. That's just dandy (I myself know that all Premier League officials are part of a vast pro-Liverpool conspiracy \u2014 pass it on). But in English football the anti-ref alliance between commentators and pundits is destructive of the game itself.</p> <p>Refs are like traffic wardens \u2014 incredibly valuable public servants who are soft targets of a dumb, unthinking sheep-like consensus. And just as traffic wardens perform a vital task in keeping the planet-raping speedophile car filth in check, so referees are crucial to the very existence of the sport.</p> <p>That's why I cringe whenever I hear some triple-chinned has-been former red-card magnet deride a ref for \"thinking he's the most important person on the pitch\". The ref <em>is</em> the most important person on the pitch \u2014 the most important person in the entire sport.</p> <p>Undermine the authority of the ref and the entire structure of the sport collapses. And what rushes to fill the vacuum? The Corinthian values of the millionaire brats who play the game? The free-market amorality of the owners? The bumbling blazered bureaucracy? Only the referee remains pure of motive and entirely dedicated to the fundamentals of the game.</p> <p>Which is why the Respect campaign doesn't go far enough. The referee should be omnipotent and beyond question. Even when the ref is wrong \u2014 totally wrong, magnificently wrong, egregiously, almost-certainly-been-bribed catastrophically wrong \u2014 the ref is right. We need to instill a culture where to challenge a ref's authority is considered the sporting equivalent of picking one's nose in front the Queen.</p> <p>We should tool the refs up. Not with guns, obviously. That would be stupid. But certainly with tasers. In fact if we're going to bring technology into the game, let's forget video (lest soccer ape the ridiculous spectacle of gridiron refs spending ages reviewing just-shot footage in especially adapted What The Butler Saw machines).</p> <p>Let's make the players wear undergarments laced with a filigree of superconductive wiring. One word of dissent, one raised eyebrow, the slightest suggestion of a smirk, one tiny gesture of sarcastic applause and the offending player is dealt a brief but instructive agony. This could be particularly effective with those players feigning injury. Bzzzzzzt! Get up. Bzzzzzzzzt! Get up. Repeat as needed.</p> <p>But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Respect needs to start in the commentary box and the backpages of the tabloids. All you old lags, all you wannabe Motsons, all you catcalling conveyers of cowardly consensus \u2014 show some respect for the game and shut your stupid mouths. The damage you do to the very fabric of the sport every time you undermine the ref is incalculable. Shut it, you slags.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Luton.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Pete Cordt (bass), Jamie Mack (vocals, guitar), Bren Monahan (drums), Matt Rushton (guitar).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> This week, one of the weekly music papers \u2013 no, not the heavy metal one, the other one \u2013 includes a free Indie Map Of Britain And Ireland, with features on the expected locations of Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff and Dublin. But there's no mention, anywhere, of the Beds, Herts and Bucks scene anywhere in its 60 pages. Outrageous! And so, for all the Home Counties outfits out there, today's New Band of the Day comes to you from Luton, birthplace of singer Ian Dury, actress Diana Dors and serial killer Charles Bronson. Oh, and a new indie band called Shapes. </p> <p>Shapes, who are unsigned and recently performed a session at Maida Vale for Radio 1 as part of their BBC Introducing project, are an identikit indie band. This is not necessarily a bad thing. They might sound like every reasonably rated indie act of the past two or three years, but that's OK. Life is short. We lead busy lives. We're cash rich and time poor. No, we're both-poor now, aren't we? So if you want someone to do the job for you, or if you've just emerged from an extended period in suspended animation and don't have the inclination or the energy to play catch-up and investigate the music scene circa 2003-2007, the likes of Foals, We Are Scientists, Maccabees, Good Shoes, Bloc Party and the rest, Shapes have generously offered to do it for you by presenting you with a neatly compressed version of all the angular, spiky music you've missed.<br> Such nice boys. A bit on the laddish side, maybe, but again, that seems to work for them. They take all that brainy, intricate math-rock and convert it into terrace chant-worthy tunes. Jamie Mack, the Jamie T of jerky geezer indie, sings with a cockney accent, so that \"face\" becomes \"fice\", \"wage\" becomes \"wige\" and \"special\" becomes\" \"speshul\", that kind of thing. Their songs, all primitive riffs and rat-a-tat rhythms, are about the seamier side of life in one of London's satellite towns, they've got one called Fools and Horses and another called Big Time Charlie while their Unsung Heroes posits Shapes as a sort of suburban Babyshambles with their tales of guttersnipes and their oiky, sub-literate take on the notion of \"fuck forever\".  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They're filling in where Kubichek! have been disgracefully ignored, and where Foals promised but so spectacularly failed to deliver with their album Antidotes.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're a cut-price version of your favourite new new-wavers \u2013 Maximo Primark, anyone? <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Put Luton on the map. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Move to Watford.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The band are unsigned, but they've got a clutch of sure-fire student disco hits in their arsenal. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Foals, Klaxons, Maximo Park, Bloc Party. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/shapesuk\">www.myspace.com/shapesuk</a>. <br><strong><br>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> The Coast. </p>",
  "<p>The expectation of an untimely end to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/ian-blair\">Sir Ian Blair</a>'s tenure at the Metropolitan police has plagued him for so long that he was forced into recycling his literary repertoire.</p> <p>In 2006, after a botched raid during which police shot a young Muslim man in the shoulder, Blair quoted Mark Twain by saying that \"accounts of my demise are premature\". In September, after claims that government ministers were preparing to ease him out of office, he stood outside Scotland Yard and repeated the phrase.</p> <p>The most serious of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/03/blair.police2\">controversies</a> that have dogged him during the three and a half years since he became the Metropolitan police commissioner was revived when the inquest into the shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> started in September.</p> <p>The killing of the innocent Brazilian electrician at Stockwell underground station, in south London, in 2005 presented the most serious blight on the career of Britain's most senior policeman.</p> <p>He was accused of misleading the public and the De Menezes family by claiming in a press conference on the afternoon of the killing that the police shooting was \"directly linked to the ongoing and expanding anti-terrorist operation\".</p> <p>An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) investigation into the Met's response to the shooting found that Blair made this remark less than an hour before one of his most senior officers, the assistant commissioner Andy Hayman, was briefing crime journalists that the dead man may have been innocent.</p> <p>Others told the inquiry they had been aware of rumours circulating within hours of De Menezes' death that his killing had been a terrible mistake. Blair said he had not been aware that the wrong man had been shot until the following day, leaving De Menezes' relatives incredulous.</p> <p>Members of the Metropolitan Police Authority criticised him for not knowing \"where the truth lay\", and said it was \"incomprehensible\" that he had not been aware, on the day of the shooting, of serious fears among his own officers that an innocent man had been gunned down.</p> <p>Blair became commissioner in February 2005 and had the misfortune to take over from Sir John Stevens, who was widely liked by the force's 31,000 officers as a \"copper's copper\". Blair, by contrast, was seen as \"New Labour's copper\" for his role in pioneering the government's favourite neighbourhood policing schemes.</p> <p>The Oxford English language and literature graduate - he continues to be a visiting fellow of Nuffield College - was brought in to reform parts of the force, and was therefore already facing hostility from within the ranks even before the July 2005 London bombings.</p> <p>A former chief constable of Surrey police, Blair rejoined the Met in 2000 as deputy commissioner. He had originally served with the force from 1975 to 1994, with a two-year stint at the Home Office.</p> <p>While Stevens was known for his ability to mix with all ranks, Blair was seen as aloof and managerial. His plans to produce \u00a3300m savings and amalgamate legendary teams like SO19 and the Flying Squad into new departments sparked horror within the force.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian a week before the July 7 attacks, Blair estimated that 10% of the Met - around 3,000 officers - were set against him.</p> <p>At around the same time, an employment tribunal found in favour of three white officers who claimed they had been wrongly disciplined over alleged racist remarks. The court found Blair had \"hung his officers out to dry\" to prove his anti-racist credentials.</p> <p>Thus the scene was set for the commissioner to face fresh calls for his resignation every time he erred towards the controversial - and such occasions have not been in short supply.</p> <p>In January 2006, he apologised to the families of the Soham murder victims, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, after claiming the media were institutionally racist. He said \"almost nobody\" could understand why the disappearance of the girls, in August 2002, had dominated the news headlines and become \"the biggest story in Britain\".</p> <p>Two months later, it emerged he had secretly recorded a conversation with the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, about counter-terrorism. He also covertly taped phone calls with officials from the IPCC and the Guardian journalist Ian Katz, who was writing a profile of him.</p> <p>He attracted further bad press for claiming that Londoners felt as safe now as they had 25 years ago and that, in Haringey, residents had taken to leaving their front doors unlocked or even open.</p> <p>The Met's conviction by an Old Bailey jury last November of breaching health and safety rules in the De Menezes killing triggered further criticism. Blair insisted that the series of catastrophic errors were a one-off and that there was no evidence of systemic failures.</p> <p>The commissioner was criticised again the following week after the publication of the official IPCC report into the shooting of De Menezes, which found that the police operation had been marred by confusion and a lack of resources. The head of the IPCC went on to accuse Blair of causing much of the \"avoidable difficulty\" facing the force since the shooting.</p> <p>More recently, he has had to deal with two high-profile cases of alleged discrimination by his force. In June, the Met's most senior Asian officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, said he would sue the force for racial discrimination and victimisation. Ghaffur later settled the case out of court.</p> <p>In July, Blair described claims that he had tried to block the promotion of another senior Asian officer, Commander Shabir Hussain, as \"inconceivable\". He robustly defended his record on diversity while giving evidence at an employment tribunal in Stratford, east London.</p> <p>Such controversies fuelled the doubts of his critics about his suitability for the job and emboldened disgruntled rank and file officers to publicly attack their boss. In May 2006, Detective Constable Peter Smyth, the chairman of the Met constables' branch, said the force's 24,000 beat constables had no confidence in Blair.</p> <p>Rank and file police organisations have transferred their anger towards the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, over their below-expectation pay offer. Blair has supported his officers' pay claims, publicly questioning why the government should choose to fight this particular battle.</p> <p>Another blow came on the day he announced his resignation. The Daily Mail printed an article that morning claiming he had made inappropriate use of public money in offering consultancy work to a personal friend. Blair denies he acted improperly.</p> <p>The final straw, however - revealed by Blair in his resignation statement - was the loss of confidence of London's new mayor, Boris Johnson. In his final interview last month before his \u00a3300,000 payoff, Blair blamed the rightwing media and Johnson for his downfall. </p> <p>During the last 24 hours of his job, Blair clashed openly with the mayor. He warned that his successor could be forced out in the same way in four years' time unless the politics was taken out of policing.</p> <p>While Johnson and the press may well have played a part in Blair's resignation, many feel that ultimately he was brought down by his own decisions and actions.</p>",
  "<p>I suppose this is where we say \"it had to happen\":</p> <blockquote> <p>Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, will issue a statement today in which he is expected to announce that he is stepping down after three controversial years as Britain's most senior policeman. Blair's announcement, believed to be his own decision, was apparently prompted by claims in today's newspapers about inappropriate use of public money in sharpening the commissioner's image.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read the full <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/02/police.menezes\">Guardian report</a> here. We await a response from the office of the mayor, who chairs the Metropolitan Police Authority for the first time on <a href=\"http://www.mpa.gov.uk/news/press/2008/08-051.htm\">Monday morning</a>. How, I wonder, will he conceal his satisfaction? <br> </p> <p><strong>UPDATE, 15.30</strong>: Former Met DAC <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Paddick\">Brian Paddick</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's sad day for British policing in that we had a pro-diversity, liberalising Commissioner but for one reason or another he's been unable to deliver what we hoped. Clearly, he's been a in a series of battles with the media, some of his own making. But he's been unable to control the strong characters at the top of the Met and therefore unable to take them with him. The final straw was that the thing he wanted most, which was to become Commissioner, seems to have got the better of him when he awarded that contract.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>All of which begs the big question - who will be the next Met chief? </p> <p><strong>UPDATE: 16.45:</strong> No two ways about it, then: it was Boris wot done it. In his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/ianblair/3123888/Sir-Ian-Blair-the-resignation-statement-in-full.html\">resignation statement</a> Sir Ian said he'd met Mayor Johnson yesterday and it had been made clear \"in a pleasant but determined way,\" that he wished for a change. Sir Ian added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"\"Personally, I see no bar to working effectively with the new mayor, but that is where we differ.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Beeb has just reported that fellow Tory and Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve isn't sad to see the back of him either. Neither is Dee Doocey AM, the Lib Dems' representative on the Metropolitan Police Authority. In a statement, she says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Metropolitan Police Service is crying out for strong leadership, and whoever takes over has a mountain to climb. The lack of leadership at the top of the MPS in recent weeks and months has resulted in the top brass fighting among themselves, rather then getting on with their real jobs of policing London. The Met must now devote all it's efforts on keeping the streets of our capital safe rather than vying for power and fighting each other.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>UPDATE, 17.10</strong>: From the London Assembly Labour Group:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is easy to forget the contribution Sir Ian has made to the Metropolitan Police Service and the safety of Londoners, building on the success of Sir John Stevens. Under Sir Ian's leadership, the roll-out of Safer Neighbourhood Teams was accelerated, the co-ordination between business groups at New Scotland Yard improved and overall crime in London fell.</p> <p>It's unfortunate that Sir Ian is leaving at this difficult time for the Met and under the cloud of an on-going investigation. We are confident that the Met's acting leadership and senior management board will not allow themselves to be distracted from the vital work of protecting Londoners.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mayor Johnson has just issued a short statement. Coming soon.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE, 17.15</strong>: Here's Mayor Johnsons' statement in full:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Sir Ian Blair has made a lasting and distinguished contribution to policing, in London and across the UK, for the last 34 years. He will be especially remembered for his successful introduction in London of the Safer Neighbourhood teams and for falling crime levels virtually across the board.</p> <p>In the face of a chronic and dangerous terrorist threat, he can be very proud of his record in helping to keep millions of Londoners safe from harm. But there comes a time in any organisation when it becomes clear it would benefit from new leadership and clarity of purpose. I believe that time is now.</p> <p>And following a meeting with Sir Ian yesterday, he has agreed to give someone else the chance to offer new leadership for policing in London. And I am sure he has done the right thing. I will always be grateful to Sir Ian for the productive start he has made to our plans to tackle serious violence and to reduce disorder on public transport.</p> <p>He leaves having made London safer and with our gratitude and best wishes. There is no doubt that he will continue to make a significant intellectual contribution to crime fighting in the UK and abroad.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>No questions were taken. Paddick is on Five Live pointing out that this has been an unprecedented route for changing the leadership of the Met. Boris has put his foot down and it's worked. He's made no secret of his desire to have the power to hire and fire the Met chief. It may be that he's effectively at least half taken it.</p> <p>I am now going to insert four large potatoes in my oven and attempt to appease three hungry children. Back soon, though.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE, 18.05</strong>: Just seen Mayor Johnson making his statement on BBC News. It brings, irresistibly to mind, what his friend and former editor Charles Moore said about him on the day after the election:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Boris, of course, does put up an act almost all the time and buffoonery is part of it. But I think a buffoon is somebody who is in some sense almost stupid and, of course, that's absolutely not the case, Boris is extremely clever...I think it [his mayoralty] could go either way, but I feel optimistic about it because he has a mandate and he has a real will to do it and, goodness, Boris has a will. He is a very, very ambitious person and I'm sure that he wants to prove that you can be this extraordinary person, and you can be this sort of pretend fool, you can do everything your way and you can end up, I think, being prime minister.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Read the whole of <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/05/charles-moore-o.html\">Moore's remarks</a>. </p>",
  "<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_nick_c.shtml\">Nick Cotton</a> is back in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/eastenders\">Albert Square</a> for Christmas 2008. God bless us, every one! He's returning this December to \"spread fear and loathing\". Or more accurately to shuffle about resembling a more Satan-infused member of <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=IGg3_T_FcOQ\">the Stray Cats</a> ruining the Lord's day for his mother <a href=\"http://www.cockneyrhymingslang.co.uk/slang/dot_cotton\">Dot</a>. Dot isn't strictly speaking to Nick about that last fiasco in 2001 when he killed his own son. But she'll forgive him. She sort of has to. She's a hardline Christian. It's in the rules. Dot turned the other cheek in '97 when Nick faked having Aids. She found joy in her heart when he was arrested for kicking Reg Cox to death. Surely she'll raise a smile now when he lurks into shot growling \"Hello Ma,\" and spoils the Branning family yule.</p> <p>Actually, good luck with that Nick. You may be one of soap's most legendary villains, but you better turn it up to 11 on the Scrooge-o-meter to make an impact chez Branning. Christmas is already ruined. Just look at them, for pity's sake. It's all a bit: \"Ooh Max, pass the Quality Streets, hey, sorry about all leaving you for dead in a shallow woodland grave business. I feel a bit daft about that now! You have first shot on the green triangles, it's only fair!\" And, \"No problem Tanya, I shouldn't have shagged my daughter in law ... 18 times ... And bloody loved it. Oops, what a bungle, eh?\" In truth, what can Nick Cotton add to this mess? Or to Pat Butcher's house, where Bianca's boyfriend Tony (Britain's hottest paedophile) is tucking up all the kiddies and planning an extra special gift for teenager Whitney.</p> <p>The fact is that Nick Cotton is now 56 years old and, apparently, recovering from cancer. Maybe he just wants a nice sit down, a mince pie and a good view of Stacey garroting Bradley with a length of tinsel. Maybe, after 23 years of spreading fear and loathing, his work is finally done.</p> <p>Regardless of Nick's agenda I'm ecstatic to have him back. I love it when old faces re-appear on soap. We've just welcomed Bianca and Ricky and I'm happy to hear that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_janine_b.shtml\">Janine Butcher</a> is coming back too. Janine stole the show during \"Frank Week\", showing up to her dad's funeral and endless wakes looking like <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=cTV5b7T8TBA\">a Lidl Alexis Carrington</a> sporting an entire season of Jane Norman workwear. Spiky, clever and conscience-free. I find these comebacks oddly reassuring. I'm older, more cynical, less skinny and so are they. I remember their sins from years ago and, like the other characters, still bear grudges. In soap, there's always someone, somewhere with a big nose who knows. Well, usually. That's one of my concerns about Nick Cotton's return. Who is left to give him a hard time about anything? Pauline Fowler's dead, Frank's dead, Ethel's long gone, Dirty Den's dead. (Apparently. <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=2aipV-TwEjA\">We've fallen for that one before</a>.) These people knew the whole Nick Cotton story.</p> <p>The slashed motorbike cables that killed his son? The time he put Mary the Punk on the game? The 867 times he ransacked Dot's purse, spent it on heroin then blamed it on a strong breeze? Without any of this backstory Nick is nothing. He's just a bloke with a collapsed quiff and a soap aversion propping up the bar trying not to look at Roxy Mitchell's cleavage. (Give up now, Nick, resistance is futile.) What EastEnders needs right now is for me to be drafted in for at least eight episodes with a loud-hailer. I remember everything. I've been on this sofa for 23 years.</p> <p>The good lord might offer forgiveness, Nick. I'm a different bloody matter.</p>",
  "<p>After last week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/25/nokia.comes.with.music\">Behind the music</a> blog on the Comes With Music subscription service, I received some communication from Nokia. They had issues with the way the deal was presented in my blog, but refused to go into details; the only point they were willing to be specific about was that the figure of 120 free downloads was wrong. In the end, none of the labels involved seemed to be able to say exactly how much their artists will be paid at this point, even though the deal is due to launch this week. </p> <p>This brings me to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/26/myspace.digitalmusic\">MySpace Music</a> venture, which launched in the US last week and is due to launch in other countries over the coming months. This is a venture that has caused serious concerns among independent labels because, in many ways, it's even more controversial than the Nokia deal. Charles Caldas, the head of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS124830+11-Jun-2008+MW20080611\">Merlin</a>, a non-profit organisation that represents some of the biggest independents explains why. </p> <p>\"The major labels have made a deal with MySpace - owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp - which gives them equity in the venture. The problem is that if independent labels who have not been offered any equity make their music available on the service, they're signing up to a service owned by their competitors.\"</p> <p>This poses many questions for indie labels. Since the system is less than transparent, what are the chances that it will be a level playing field? How can they be equitable without equity? What are the chances they'll get placed in a prominent space on the server, let alone trust that they'll get accurate information regarding how many downloads they've had?</p> <p>MySpace Music will largely get its revenue from advertising, which means that every time a fan decides to stream their favourite independent artist (this, of course, relates to unsigned artists too), then Universal, just to name the major with the biggest equity, will get paid. </p> <p>As Caldas explains: \"MySpace has built its reputation on being the home of bands like Arctic Monkeys, not Christina Aguilera. It's disrespectful, if nothing else, to launch the service without them on board.\"</p> <p>Through the advent of digital music sites, the majors have lost much of their control over music distribution and many people see ventures like this as a way for them to claw some of it back.</p> <p>Martin Mills, chairman of Beggars Group, one of the biggest independents, said last week: \"We also believe the competition authorities around the world will take a keen interest in this; when you have a service, reportedly 40% owned by four companies with an 80% market share (presumably solely by virtue of the repertoire they provide to it) acting as a gateway with those four companies benefiting not just from their own sales, but from those of their competitors, questions have to be asked about market dominance.\" He adds, \"Also very worrying is that we find much of our content up and available on the new service, despite the fact that we have no licence in place with them.\"</p> <p>And, as in the case of the Nokia deal, the artists and their managers are left in the dark as to how profits will filter down to them and how they will be distributed. </p> <p>MySpace has so far been a fantastic tool for independents and unsigned artists to reach out to a big audience, so it's sad to see them bowing to the corporates when, with a bit more preparation and loyalty to the music makers who built it, MySpace Music could've been a great way to support equality on the internet. </p> <p>News Corp and record labels don't create music, musicians do. It'll be interesting to see if it gets to a point where artists decide not to play along anymore and take their music elsewhere. There's already a new coalition in the works with some big names on board that is looking to organise artists and make their voices heard. It'll be launched this weekend, at <a href=\"http://www.inthecity.co.uk/showscreen.php?site_id=30&amp;screentype=site&amp;screenid=30\">In The City</a>, so watch this space.</p>",
  "<p>Not for the first time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/jonny-wilkinson\">Jonny Wilkinson's</a> life feels like a soap opera. When the news of his dislocated knee came on the very same day that Danny Cipriani made his comeback, it felt like a scriptwriter's stretch too far. In winter though, Wilkinson's injuries are as inevitable as the shortening of the evenings. By my count this is his 15th since <em>that</em> day in 2003*. And again some pundits are predicting that Wilkinson won't be seen playing Test rugby again. </p> <p>In another quirky concurrence his book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tackling-Life-Jonny-Wilkinson/dp/0755318439/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222953013&amp;sr=1-1\">Tackling Life</a>, is released today. Reading it makes me think that Wilkinson will be back, if just because he has more to offer English rugby now than he ever has done in the past. Through coping with everything his life has thrown at him since he reached the Beatles at Shea Stadium peak of his fame in 2003, he has matured into one of the most intelligent and thoughtful people in sport. His skills may be less adept and the returns may grow scantier (though they'd showed no sign of it this season), but he has accumulated so much knowledge and understanding. </p> <p>How many sports stars can you think of who would be willing to talk openly about the effect reading about Schrodinger's cat had on their lives? \"Quantum physics helped me to realise that I was creating this destructive reality and that all I needed to do to change it was to change the way I chose to perceive the world.\" </p> <p>It sure makes a change from the tripe most players trot out in interviews and biographies. With most players the closest we get to a glimpse of a hinterland is when we see them prancing in lycra or gurning over a plate of food on Saturday-night primetime. And all the while Wilkinson has been spending his time overcoming his fears about his own mortality. \"I couldn't figure out how to avoid death: it was like a game I could not win. The closer I got to family and friends and the better things got, the more I had to lose.\"</p> <p>This is a man, you sense, who has spent his life looking for his own enlightenment. And he seems to have found it, something he never achieved in the meticulous obsession with perfection that characterised his early years. \"I would trade all the immediate joy around me at that time for what would undoubtedly be an even greater, more worthwhile and lasting experience further down the line,\" he writes of his old self. \"I did not intend to go laughing, joking, smiling and therefore wasting all my dream savings away.\" </p> <p>Like many other members of the side who won the 2003 World Cup \u2013 Steve Thompson has said almost exactly the same thing \u2013 when Wilkinson did reach that \"even greater, more worthwhile experience\" that he had been working towards, he found himself overwhelmed by anti-climax. Hiding in rucks and behind sunglasses, his mindset seems to have reached a nadir at the very height of his personal and public achievement. \"I felt,\" he writes in Tackling Life, \"like I was tumbling out of control.\" </p> <p>Finding the noise of his own thoughts drowned out by the roars of the adoring public around him, all those subsequent injuries have enabled Wilkinson to retreat into the quiet corners of his own mind, just as the Beatles ensconced themselves in the studio and refused to come out. He has emerged from the last five years as a stronger person, and in that sense as a better player too. </p> <p>He is still terrifyingly obsessive, kicking the ball around 1,000 times a week. \"Three-hundred place kicks, 250 punts with my right foot, 250 with my left, 120 drop goals, 120 restarts \u2013 that makes a total of about 1,000 kicks to prepare for just 20 [in a match]. That's near enough 50 rehearsals for each single defining event. To me that has been a totally acceptable ratio.\" But he has married the professional approach to mental stability. Most other people would have been broken by the Job-like string of misfortunes he's endured, but for Wilkinson you sense it has been the making of him.</p> <p>It is easy to imagine him providing the kind of ballast for the England team that Mike Catt has in recent years. Catt had more than his fair share of traumas along the way too, and he grew into one of the shrewdest minds in the game. Wilkinson has seen it all, done it all and his wisdom would be all too welcome to a team that too often over the last five years has seemed to lack for leadership. With all the brouhaha about Cipriani, it is worth remembering that Wilkinson is an authentic great, one of the sport's finest players. </p> <p>It is fair for pessimists (realists even) to speculate that his body is just too broken, that he will be unable to stay fit for long enough to play much. Yet he's not even 30, and mentally he's never been fitter. Until he decides to retire himself, he will always be worth a place in the England squad, as much as a mentor and leader as a player.</p> <p>*The roll call: Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder again, haematoma, knee, medial ligament, shoulder, appendix, groin, abductor, knee, kidney, ankle, shoulder, and knee.</p>",
  "<p>The suggestion that Britain's man in Kabul <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/02/afghanistan.usforeignpolicy\">has warned</a> a fellow ambassador that the current international military campaign against the Taliban is, in the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4860080.ece\">words of the Times</a>, \"doomed to failure\", should surprise no one. What is news is the way that the Foreign Office has tried to cover the tracks of Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles in a web of obfuscation.<br> The spokesman in London told the Times that the reported remarks by Sir Sherard to his French opposite number were a \"parody\" of what he really said. Instead of muttering behind their hands, the men and women in King Charles Street should come clean and say exactly what Cowper-Coles' assessment of the crisis in Afghanistan really is, and what the British government intends to do about it. The campaign against the Taliban and their allies on either side of the Afghan border with Pakistan has not been going well. The fight is spreading, and the New York Times, through the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/pakistan/northwest-pakistan/index.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Carlotta%20Gall%20%20Jane%20Perlez%20pakistan%20taliban&amp;st=cse\">despatches of Carlotta Gall and Jane Perlez</a>, about the best in the business, suggest that the Taliban are well in control of most of the provinces ringing the Afghan capital.<br> The American command this summer has tried to pour oil on troubled waters, but only succeeded in setting light to it. In July, President Bush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/usforeignpolicy.usa\">signed the operational order</a> to allow US ground as well as air forces to conduct \"hot pursuit\" operations into Pakistan territory along the North West Frontier, in particular into the provinces of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). This is in breach of international law, because it is the waging of aggressive action on sovereign territory, albeit that of an ally, without prior warning or permission. <br> Following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/usa.afghanistan\">a raid by US Navy Seals</a> flown in by helicopter on September 6, the US command said it would behave better in future and consult its Pakistan allies about such raids. However, there have been several unannounced attacks by Predator drones since then.<br> On his visit to London this week, General David Petraeus, who, as the new Central Command boss, is in overall charge of US military operations in Afghanistan as well as Iraq, warned that the fight in Afghanistan is about to get a lot worse. \"Obviously, the trends in Afghanistan have been in the wrong direction,\" he said in London and implied that he would like to see a \"surge\" of US and allied troops on the same lines as the surge he commanded in Iraq in the past 18 months.  The commander of the Afghan theatre for the US forces, General David McKiernan, <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/01/mideast/military.php\">is reported to be requesting</a> the Pentagon for more American troops. It is unlikely that the UK will be considering matching the US increase \u2013 given the widening gaps between US and British commanders and analysts about tactics on the ground and operational methods and concepts. There is evidence of a widening split on strategy \u2013 what the campaign is really about and what realistically it can achieve.<br> The American approach, for all the sophisticated jargon and high fallutin' language by David Petraeus about \"mastering the human terrain\" and \"winning the narrative\" in his counter-insurgency doctrine, the Americans still believe in the kinetic approach, the use of force to smash the enemy. This has led to at least 4,500 non-combatant civilians, at least, being killed in US raids across southern Afghanistan this year alone.  More than ever, this is a US-commanded and US-driven campaign: General McKiernan now commands the international support mission to President Karzai, comprising some 39 nations. At the same time, he commands Operation Enduring Freedom against al-Qaida. International efforts in Afghanistan have been bedevilled by the division of commands and missions of the international forces \u2013 and this is now sure to get worse. The American command has little time for its Nato allies, even those like the Canadians, the British, Danes and Dutch who are doing the heavy lifting in the south west and taking casualties.  America's view of Nato as a blunt instrument to confront and contain US enemies, from Russia in Georgia, to the Taliban in Waziristan, raises doubts about the value of the alliance in the present complex crisis, developing into a perfect storm from the eastern Mediterranean to Kashmir. These doubts reinforce the old maxim that it is hard to turn a defensive alliance into an offensive one \u2013 particularly, in the cause of wars of choice.  The outlines of the perfect storm are more serious than their lack of coverage in the international media might suggest. In the past month, they have hidden behind the global banking meltdown.  In Afghanistan, there is growing mistrust of Hamid Karzai and his corrupt regime in the run-up to next year's elections. He has been soliciting Saudi help to start talks with some of the Taliban. The Taliban is getting stronger in numbers, tactics, and weaponry. It <a href=\"http://www.worldnetdaily.com/?pageId=76286\">is now thought</a> that, at a secret meeting in Peshawar last year, Iran agreed to open up a major supply line of arms and trainers to Taliban in south-west Afghanistan. Since then, Taliban affiliates have been widening their operations, most notably with the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad last week.<br> With the resurgence of fighting in Kashmir, where al-Qaida and Taliban allies form the core of the Islamic fighters, there are growing fears of a looming confrontation between India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have, since 1947, regarded Afghanistan and Kashmir as the zones of \"strategic depth\". The novelty this time round in a major Indo-Pak confrontation is that, this time, both countries have nuclear weapons, and in the woodwork of their leadership there are fanatics who believe in using them. Pakistan's military command believes that any fight with India will be one for survival, so they must gather in all the allies they can, including the Taliban.  The Afghan mission in its present form is doomed because it is only a part of much worse and deepening crisis in the region as a whole. Our man in Kabul was right to warn his mates about it, but it's about time our own government 'fessed up and started telling us the truth about what is going right and wrong in Afghanistan, and why we need to be there.</p>",
  "<p>The number of UK households in fuel poverty rose to 3.5 million in 2006, the latest official figures showed today.</p> <p>The data, released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, showed an increase of one million on 2005 levels. They include around 2.75 million homes classed as \"vulnerable\" - those that contain a child, elderly person or someone with a long-term illness.</p> <p>To be classed as being in fuel poverty, households have to spend more than 10% of their income on gas and electricity. In England, 2.4 million fuel-poor households had fallen into fuel poverty by 2006, of which 1.9 million were vulnerable. </p> <p>This was 900,000 more households than 2005, of which 700,000 were vulnerable.</p> <p>The government attributed the rise to a 22% increase in consumer energy bills between 2005 and 2006.</p> <p>Although the major suppliers cut their tariffs early last year, they increased them early this year, and again in the summer, which could mean the number of homes in fuel poverty today is actually much higher than 3.5 million.</p> <p>The environment minister, Hilary Benn, said that while the government was committed to tackling fuel poverty, \"sharply rising energy price rises have made that goal increasingly difficult\".</p> <p>He said that since 2000, the government had spent \u00a320bn on fuel poverty, benefits and programmes.</p> <p>Unions and charities called on the government to take action to keep prices down. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: \"It is imperative that the government acts on our motion to the Labour conference last week to give the energy regulator the power to cap gas and electricity prices.</p> <p>\"There is no justification for the high prices currently being charged. Somebody has got to get a grip.\"</p> <p>Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth said there were at least 5 million households already in fuel poverty, and they would be taking ministers to court next week over their failure to tackle the problem.</p> <p>\"Fuel poverty is escalating out of control and the response from government has been completely feeble,\" said Help the Aged's special adviser Mervyn Kohler.</p> <p>\"What is needed is a government strategy that combines both short- and long-term solutions - crisis payments to help with the here and now, and in the longer term improvements to the energy efficiency of our housing stock. </p> <p>\"That is why Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth have sought a judicial review - to ensure the government finally delivers on its duty to end fuel poverty.\"</p> <p>The charity Age Concern estimates that around 5.5 million households could be pushed into fuel poverty this winter, with one in three pensioner households among them. </p> <p>Age Concern's director general, Gordon Lishman, said measures to improve energy efficiency would not be enough on their own to solve the problem. </p> <p>\"What we really need is an urgent review of the government's fuel poverty strategy to tackle the escalating crisis,\" he said. </p> <p>\"As a starting point, the government should be working with energy companies to reform their social tariffs to end the inequalities of energy pricing that mean poorer people pay more.\"</p>",
  "<p>The deputy chairman of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/ofcom\">Ofcom</a> today questioned whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC's</a> plans for \"practical partnerships\" to bridge the public service broadcasting funding gap of up to \u00a3235m a year will work.</p> <p>Philip Graf, speaking at the Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer's Citizenship and Broadcasting conference, said that while Ofcom agreed that the BBC must remain strong, he called on the corporation's director general, Mark Thompson, to reveal his proposals.</p> <p>\"Are these partnerships on a big enough scale to make a real dent in the \u00a3145m to \u00a3235m gap [in PSB funding] identified?\" he asked. \"Responses from other stakeholders suggested the BBC's initial ideas did not have that big an impact.\"</p> <p>Graf said that the idea of partnerships - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/23/bbc.television2\">such as technology sharing and bolstering regional and local news by other broadcasters</a> - raised the question of when \"amiable cooperation becomes anti-competitive cartel\".</p> <p>\"We are no longer in the cosy world of just four broadcasters,\" he said. \"'Partnerships can have unintended consequences for the wider media ecology or foreclose new entrants who will provide content that meets public purposes.\"</p> <p>Graf did, however, reiterate that a strong BBC was essential to the future of PSB, echoing comments by the Ofcom chief executive, Ed Richards, that the corporation's core services would be protected.</p> <p>\"You do not make PSB stronger by weakening the BBC,\" said Graf. \"But you do also not make the BBC stronger by weakening PSB.\"</p> <p>Thompson, speaking at the Royal Television Society conference in London last week, cast doubt on Ofcom's plans for securing the future of public service broadcasting.</p> <p>\"To me, the debate needs to become more ambitious, more imaginative and less defeatist,\" he said. \"I want to offer a practical set of partnerships and initiatives which are deliverable and big enough to be game-changing. Which do not require legislation or any new regulatory machinery - and which therefore can make an economic difference to the other PSBs in months rather than years.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/23/bbc.television2\">The BBC, which raised the idea of partnerships in June</a>, is desperate to move the PSB funding debate away from the idea of \"top-slicing\" the licence fee or giving a stake in BBC Worldwide to Channel 4 to bridge its looming funding gap of up to \u00a3100m per year by 2012.</p> <p>\"BBC Worldwide is not a portable cash machine,\" Thompson said. \"Worldwide's ability to generate revenue comes from its closeness to the BBC itself and to BBC intellectual property.\"</p> <p>BBC trustee Diane Coyle said: \"The BBC Trust is committed to a strong, sustainable future for public service broadcasting. As part of our contribution we have asked the director general to develop proposals for partnerships with other PSBs. When he comes forward with those proposals we will be looking at them carefully, including at their scale and significance.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>So tonight's the night. What's going to happen? Let's look at Sarah Palin, Joe Biden and moderator Gwen Ifill \u2013 now a more active than passive character in this drama \u2013 in turn.</p> <p>Palin. Let's assume she doesn't pull a classic boner for the ages that destroys her credibility in five seconds' time. I think she might, but let's say for the sake of argument that she doesn't make it that easy. What standard does she need to meet?</p> <p>The media have been saying things like, \"as long as she doesn't seem like a total idiot, she'll win.\" But I don't think that's right. I actually believe that substance matters in these forums a little more than that. One of the reasons Barack Obama beat John McCain in their first debate is that many viewers found him more substantive than they'd figured him to be. Whether they can remember specific things he said isn't the point. It's that he came across as knowledgeable. </p> <p>So put it this way if you like: command of substance is a form of performance. A candidate could not get up there and, however charismatically and empathically, read from the St. Louis telephone directory. You have to know <em>something</em>.</p> <p>So the standard she needs to meet is this: She can't seem like the student who gets up to give a book report who clearly hasn't read the book. Every American knows that type. Every American <em>was </em>that type, in one English class or another. \"Jean Valjean was this, uh, guy, who, uh, one day, and it was a nice, summer day\u2026\" People know when someone's faking it.</p> <p>In the Alaska gubernatorial debate clips I've watched, Palin was fine to good. But she was comfortable with that material, which she'd dealt with as a mayor and a state commissioner. But now, it's quite obvious that she hadn't given 10 minutes thought to national or international affairs before she was plucked. She's been studying for three weeks. </p> <p>In three weeks, how much can one learn about the credit crisis, the trade imbalance, the financing of the Social Security system, the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, the impact of WTO regulations on American manufacturers, the latest research on carbon sequestration at coal plants, the auto makers' pension problems, telecommunications policy and the lack of broadband, the path-to-citizenship question, the Syria-Lebanon situation, the India-Pakistan dispute, the Chinese connection to Africa and Latin America, the Mahdi Army, the matter of Taiwan, the concerns about military preparedness, the history of the Geneva Conventions and loose nukes?</p> <p>I've just listed 17 issues areas. I could list 117. A legitimate question could be asked in a debate about any of them. Some questions will be predictable, and Palin will be able to fall back on rehearsed boilerplate. But some won't be. And if she can't talk with some degree of, if not actual knowledge, then at least persuasively fake pseudo-knowledge about, say, India and Pakistan then she might as well have gone up on stage naked. Substance does matter. </p> <p>Joe Biden. Obviously, Biden could talk for five days straight about 117 areas of policy. Which suggests his first challenge: Don't. Keep it short.</p> <p>Aside from that, he has two main jobs. First and by far most important, don't condescend. Don't show off. There will presumably be moments when it's embarrassingly evident that she is talking gibberish. He can't smile or snicker (remember, Joe: split-screen camera). </p> <p>He must take her seriously even \u2013 especially \u2013 when she least deserves it. He can't spend the whole evening correcting her. No: \"In fact, governor, let me explain that the details of that legislation were as follows\u2026\" Yes: \"Well, if I'm remembering correctly, I think that bill was actually more directed at trying to\u2026\"</p> <p>Second: Palin will attack, attack, attack, both him and Obama. She'll be trying to goad him into being unchivalrous. Biden has to avoid the trap and fend these off forcefully but politely. Both these tasks require emotional restraint; a state of zen coolness. Biden should prepping for this debate not by rehearsing lines but by doing yoga.</p> <p>Gwen Ifill. The <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iVAeSkYI2HWjkaX11O2cv09Zf73wD93I1TVO1\">mini-controversy</a> of the last 24 hours may have the effect of forcing Ifill, one of America's best television journalists, to censor herself and strike from her question list one or two of the tougher questions she had ready for Palin.</p> <p>Ifill needs to stand her ground. In a case like this, it's the precise crafting of the questions that matters. Questions have to be phrased in just the right way so that they demand that the answerer bring some knowledge to bear on the issue, while at the same time they don't cross the line into being too clever by half. Also they can't be too open-ended, because open-ended questions just let the person fling b.s. around.</p> <p>Too open-ended: \"Governor, give us your thoughts on telecommunications policy and how to expand broadband.\"</p> <p>Too clever: \"Governor, expound if you will on the comparative merits of the broadband policies of the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and Estonia.\"</p> <p>Just right: \"Governor, many people think the 1996 telecommunications act hasn't fostered broadband growth at a rate that it could have. What changes would you recommend to that act?\"</p> <p>That's a fair question. It doesn't demand that she be an expert on policy, but it does fairly demand that she know a little something about one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in the 1990s and have some basic ideas about the issue. </p> <p>The other thing Ifill shouldn't do is give Palin opportunities to correct some of the idiotic things she's said over the last few days. In a new Katie Couric segment released yesterday, Palin affirmed that she saw a right to privacy in the Constitution. That's a dreadful error from the perspective of the so-called pro-life movement. Ifill shouldn't just ask her something like, \"Do you want to clarify your views on privacy and the Constitution?\" She'll have been coached for that. </p> <p>Assuming there are no big historic moments, I suspect that this debate won't end up mattering that much. Most Americans think John McCain made an irresponsible choice, and most Americans will still think that the morning after election day.</p>",
  "<p>In recent weeks, liberals and conservatives alike have been warning the Republic party - and Sarah Palin herself - that their vice-presidential candidate is woefully incapable of serving in the White House. Take <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=MDZiMDhjYTU1NmI5Y2MwZjg2MWNiMWMyYTUxZDkwNTE=\">Kathleen Parker</a>, for example, writing in the National Review:</p> <blockquote> <p>Palin's recent interviews with Charles Gibson, Sean Hannity, and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive, earnest, confident candidate. Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League. \u2026 Only Palin can save McCain, her party and the country she loves. She can bow out for personal reasons, perhaps because she wants to spend more time with her newborn. No one would criticise a mother who puts her family first. Do it for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>The main reason she is inadequate is her stunning lack of knowledge about the issues that anyone in her position should know about, most prominently foreign policy. The few news anchors the McCain team has allowed her to speak with - Gibson, Hannity and Couric - could all clearly dance circles around the wannabe Veep when it comes to international politics. But Palin is also alarmingly unskilled when it comes to a more indigenous matter: speaking the English language. Or, as I wouldn't be too surprised to hear her put it, talking American.</p> <p>The petrified McCain team has, wisely, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/sep/29/sarah.palin.media.debate\">barely permitted Palin to speak in public</a>. They are so worried about her oratorical ineptitude, in fact, that they successfully negotiated to limit the amount of time she could be interrogated on a single topic during tonight's vice-presidential debate. Now, each candidate will have just 90 seconds to answer a question, followed by a two-minute discussion period.<br> The few times Palin has spoken at length, with the exception of her heavily rehearsed performance at the Republican national convention, she has revealed both her limited vocabulary and how difficult it is for her to utter complete, complex sentences.</p> <p>I began to notice the problem during <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=5782924&amp;page=2\">Palin's interview with Charlie Gibson</a> - not coincidentally, her first major unscripted foray into the public speaking realm. When Gibson asked her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/12/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">whether she agreed with the Bush doctrine</a> - and then had to explain to her what it was \u2013 she replied: \"If there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we have every right to defend our country.\" Even to the untrained ear that sentence sounds awkward. \"Legitimate and enough\"? It can't possibly be elitist to suggest that \"legitimate and sufficient\" would have come off as more literate.</p> <p>At another point, Gibson asked Palin whether it took hubris for her to jump so quickly and unquestioningly at McCain's offer to run with him. The halting way she answered made me wonder whether she knew what the word hubris actually meant: \"I - I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that readiness and knowing that you can't blink.\" Even if we give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she does know what hubris is, her sentence barely makes sense. What does it mean that she has \"confidence in ... knowing that you can't blink\"?</p> <p>Another way that Palin has revealed her limited linguistic skills is through her repetition of certain words or phrases. As <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/opinion/25Cohen.html?em\">Roger Cohen pointed out</a> recently in the New York Times, she \"loves the word 'exceptional.' At a rally in Nevada the other day, the Republican vice-presidential candidate said: 'We are an exceptional nation.' Then she declared: 'America is an exceptional country.' In case anyone missed that, she added: 'You are all exceptional Americans.'\" And as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/us/politics/01palin.html\">Kathleen Seeyle has reported</a> about Palin's past debate performances:</p> <blockquote> <p>Her sentences were distinguished by their repetition of words, by the use of the phrase \"here in Alaska\" and for gaps. On paper, her sentences would have been difficult to diagram. John Bitney, the policy director for her campaign for governor and the main person who helped prepare her for debates, said her repetition of words was \"her way of running down the clock as her mind searches for where she wants to go.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Andrew Halcro, however, who ran against Palin in the Alaska gubernatorial race, was perfectly succinct when he called one of her debate answers during that campaign \"political gibberish\".</p> <p>Perhaps the most painful verbal moment for Palin came during <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/25/eveningnews/main4479062.shtml?source=RSSattr=HOME_4479062\">her appearance on Couric's show</a> when the newswoman asked Palin to explain what she'd meant when she cited Alaska's proximity to Russia as proof that she has foreign policy experience. Palin responded: \"[I meant] that Alaska has a very narrow maritime border between a foreign country, Russia, and on our other side, the land - boundary that we have with - Canada.\" Never mind that you can't have a border between countries - countries either border each other, or they share a border.</p> <p>Far more worrisome was Palin's next sentence, which she was unable to complete: \"It's funny that a comment like that was kind of made to - cari - I don't know, you know?\" It seemed as though Palin stopped herself because she'd been considering using the word \"caricature\", but was afraid she'd do so incorrectly. She ended her spluttering by sighing: \"Reporters.\" Kind of the way a redneck might say: \"Women. Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em!\"</p> <p>Couric suggested to Palin that the word she'd been searching for was \"mocked\". Palin, who managed to come off as both exhausted from the effort of trying to translate her thoughts into words and yet still belligerent, responded by saying: \"Yeah, mocked. I guess that's the word. Yeah.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/opinion/27herbert.html\">Bob Herbert commented</a> on the exchange in an op-ed for the New York Times: \"It is not just painful, but frightening to watch someone who could become the vice-president of the United States stumbling around like this in an interview.\" Herbert was focused mainly on Palin's lack of readiness to lead the country, rather than her basic linguistic inadequacies. But the two go together. I would guess they stem from her lack of intellectual curiosity and her concomitant arrogance.</p> <p>I could go on and on. I could mention the time when she mentioned \"predator\" lenders, rather than predatory lenders, to Couric. But you get the point. </p> <p>I have to wonder whether Palin, who is being touted by Republican leaders as an anti-elitist, knows the definition of \"elitism\":</p> <blockquote> <p>1. The belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority, as in intellect, social status, or financial resources.</p> <p>2. a. The sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group or class.<br>b. Control, rule or domination by such a group or class.</p> </blockquote> <p>Funny that a so-called anti-elitist is woman who rewards members of her inner circle and old high-school friends with plum appointments; who is a member of the party that has been ruling the White House for eight years; who seems so haughty about her right to run for the vice-presidency that she makes no effort to hide her exasperation with members of the media who are trying to assess whether she is prepared for the job.</p> <p>Oh, and hubris?

  "<p>Pity the poor pension fund manager charged with putting his punters' savings in a range of investments to provide an adequate and secure income over time. Perhaps purchase an office block or two? Some juicy shares in the bouncy ball that is now the stock market? <br> Yet there could be another far more secure and socially and environmentally beneficial haven for pension funds \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/MoneyTaxAndBenefits/ManagingMoney/SavingsAndInvestments/DG_10013986\"> local authority bonds</a>. These were once used to build the civic infrastructure and utilities of our cities and indeed they were a common source of public finance until the Thatcher government began the era of constrained local financial independence and increasing centralised economic control.<br> There are no legal constraints on local authorities raising bonds, but it has not been encouraged by governments since the 1980s. However <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/nov/29/uk.london2004\">this changed</a> when an important precedent was set whereby the Treasury authorised Transport for London (itself a local authority in legal terms) to issue \u00a3600m of bonds as part of its borrowings to improve transport infrastructure. These were snapped up by big investors.<br> This idea was first raised some time ago in the report People's Pensions, published by the New Economics Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/\">NEF</a>) but it is even more timely today given the rising unemployment and business collapses inevitable in the wake of the credit crunch. This could be substantially reversed should even a small part of the at least \u00a31tn in private pension schemes be invested into such bonds for public infrastructure. The proven economics of reducing energy use through efficiency, combined heat and power and renewables for buildings make it an excellent choice for funding by such local authority bonds. Part of the savings would fund the repayments due on such bonds. This form of infrastructural investment is also crucial to reducing fuel poverty and tackling climate change, since buildings are responsible for 40% of the UK's carbon dioxide emissions. The final advantage is that this approach could provide a much more stable pension environment, thus encouraging people to put more money into their pensions, and could help close the \"savings gap\" in the pension market.<br> The lead could be taken by the country's largest local authority, Birmingham, which has a proud history of the use of local authority bonds in developing the city in the last century. It is now the biggest landlord in Britain, owning more than 80,000 houses and flats. Many of these are <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020409/ai_n12614691\">in need of repair</a> and are energy inefficient. There is nothing to stop Birmingham city council following the example of Transport for London and launching a \"Brummie bond\". This could fund a \"carbon army\" of local employees to crawl like ants over its entire housing stock, making it energy tight, warmer and cheaper to heat. Renewables such as solar electricity and water heating and larger scale combined heat and power systems would all provide business opportunities in the area.<br> Now is the time for the pensions and savings industry to start lobbying for government encouragment of the widespread use of local authority bonds. They are already legal, Transport for London have shown the way, and it could at last give one section of the finance industry a chance to show its social responsibility and its commitment to nurturing the real economy as well as the environment.</p>",
  "<p>Just as no one ever went broke by underestimating the taste of the great US public, so is it the first law of Hollywood that films featuring monkeys are a guaranteed box office smasheroo (and that's a direct quote from Harvey Weinstein). This week's Casting the News features real monkeys and fake monkeys, a monkey god and much monkey-related hilarity. It's a simian horn of plenty; a till-ringing extravaganza that's like Titanic crossed with Lord of the Rings. Except with more monkeys.</p> <p>The basis for our production is an out-of-work actor named <a href=\"http://www.apakistannews.com/lucknow-railways-employ-monkey-man-83655\">Acchan Miyan</a>, who now poses as \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a monkey in order to combat a monkey infestation at a train station in northern India. It transpires that these creatures have been swooping down from the rafters to steal food and rip up train seats. Yet now they have met their match. \"Poor passengers will certainly be protected from monkey menace by Acchan's act,\" explains commuter Santosh Kumar. Monkey Menace might even be a good title for our film.</p> <p>So now Acchan earns the equivalent of \u00a33.50 a day by scurrying about the station, sporting a brown mask, an erect tail and (intriguingly) a pair of natty scarlet shorts.

Moreover, we reckon that Kingsley might bring a necessary touch of pathos to the role, articulating the conflicted nature of a man who perhaps once dreamed of playing the Dane but now earns his keep by making chimp noises on all fours. </p> <p>What else? We also need someone to play <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman\">Hanuman the monkey god</a>, the wise mentor who offers advice on technique and behaviour and occasionally goes absolutely bananas and starts hurling his own faeces around the temple (Anthony Hopkins, maybe?).

  "<p>The second season of the glossy historical drama The Tudors comes to an end tomorrow night and I'm going to miss its glorious costumes, sumptuous sets, uplifting score and hilariously cavalier approach to historical fact. More than anything, I'll miss Jonathan Rhys Meyers' acting-by-numbers (sad = look down, happy = laugh loudly, pensive = not sure, can we go back to the looking down thing?). Jon-Jon aside, there have been highlights galore and lessons too: in fact, here are a few Fascinating If Not Always Factual Things I Learned From Watching The Tudors:</p> <p><strong>1. Things every woman in the 16th century must have had, by law</strong></p> <p>A scheming father-and-brother team who helped you marry the king/become queen/meet a horrible end. A large collection of make-up, fake tan and body oil, despite it being a full 450 years before Superdrug opened. An inability to look any man in the eye even though you will almost certainly agree to have sex with them within three weeks/one episode, whichever is shorter. 'A bit of previous' with several of the crowned heads of Europe, and/or an inappropriate liaison with a lord of the realm who is very possibly scheming against you. A ludicrously small dog named Nonny. A dress wider than the doors of your house.</p> <p><strong>2. Alternately shouting and pouting is not acting, Jonathan Rhys Meyers<br></strong><br>All kudos for looking a lot sexier in a black leather jerkin than the real Henry VIII ever did, but technically-speaking, and sadly for Mr Meyers, there is a bit more to acting than just that. Did no-one think to sit Jon down before shooting started and give him a few pointers? Like, for example, pause too long in the middle of a scene and you run the risk of the viewer switching over to see who Jonathan Ross has got on his sofa this week. Flash your eyes too often and you will look like you've had a recent head injury. And staring blankly out of a window is no substitute for real emotion. Did he have it written into his contract that facial expressions would have to be paid for on a pro-rata basis?</p> <p><strong>3. Throw enough sex at a show and you can call anything 'history'<br></strong><br>Remember how all that talky stuff ruined those great films Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love? The Tudors' writers sure learned a lesson from that, and that lesson was basically: when in doubt about historical fact, write in a sex scene instead. Henry goes for a ride in the woods with trusty sidekick the Duke of Suffolk and ends up snogging a peasant's wife who stumbles into their path. Henry, at a loose end while the Queen is with child, turns her ladies-in-waiting into his own personal harem. Henry, out hunting for the day, accidentally falls in love with Jane Seymour (whoops!). All of which begs the question: who was running the country? Didn't Henry VIII establish the Anglican church, unite England and Wales and invade France? When did he find the time? And wasn't he too tired?</p> <p><strong>4. Renaissance England was full of good-looking people<br></strong><br>Smallpox, what smallpox? Forget malaria, diphtheria, syphilis, rickets and scurvy, to look at The Tudors cast \u2013 even the servants \u2013 you'd be forgiven for thinking that the 16th century had boasted a Champneys, Fitness First and Vidal Sassoon on every corner. The creamy complexions and bulging biceps weren't confined to kings, aristos and battle-glorious soldiers either. Oh no. The pious priests were where the real beauty was. Aussie hunk Sam O'Neill dominated season one as Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, and Jeremy Northam brought the pretty to this season as the troubled (read: smouldering) Thomas More. Conscience pained by rifts in the church? Locked up in the tower, facing certain death? Never mind, love, you've still got your looks. <strong>5. Finally, proof that The Rules will not bag you a man<br></strong><br>Anne Boleyn played a very clever game, of course, to land Henry, famously making him wait seven years before agreeing to consummate their romance, and generously letting him sleep with other women (including her sister) to show him how hollow and meaningless his life without her would be. Add in a few teasing text messages and an email flirtation and you've got The Rules, the insane US book that coerced thousands of 90s women into subjugating themselves in the search for Mr Right. Still, it didn't do Anne much good in the end, what with the public beheading and all. The axe fell, the head bounced and the crowd shouted 'he's just not that into you'...</p> <p><strong>6. Someone on the production team has a great sense of humour<br></strong><br>The Tudors is currently shooting its third season, due to be transmitted in 2009, and it's been announced that eccentric singer Joss Stone, she of the mid-Atlantic accent, erratic behaviour and Notting Hill fanbase, will play Henry's fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. That's a casting session you'd pay money to sit in on, isn't it? Either the producer has a courageously populist sensibility, or he's heard that Jacob's Creek are looking for a new show to sponsor. But of course, Henry's marital shenanigans didn't stop with Anne, so it'll be interesting to see how the producers cast wife number five, Katherine Howard. Let's hope Kerry Katona's available.</p>",
  "<p>All historians know that if you want to know what the common people are up to, you find out what governments pass laws against. Read in this light, the Roman Catholic <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/book/7208204\">code of canon law</a> contains a startling illumination. The other day I found my way to the rules for absolving whomsoever the priest may have screwed.<br><br>This is a big no no, as the commentary explains: </p> <blockquote> <p>The absolution of a partner in sin against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue is invalid except in danger of death; apart from that danger, any priest who knowingly attempts to absolve an accomplice in such a sin commits a very serious offence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments#Division_of_the_Commandments\">sixth commandment</a>, by the way, is the one that prohibits adultery, at least the way the Catholics and Lutherans count them: other protestants make that the seventh commandment.</p> <p>So far this is entirely straightforward and reasonable. If a priest is given the power to absolve sins that he has himself committed, this stops them being important sins at all. Giving the priest the right to absolve his mistress or concubine must be strictly forbidden because it would eviscerate the requirement of celibacy.</p> <p>But there is fascinating pendant in my commentary (which has been officially approved by the Bishops' conference of England and Wales). This says \"the canon must be interpreted strictly, so no offence is committed \u2026 if the priest absolves the accomplice without in any way realising that he or she was in fact his accomplice [or] if the priest does not specifically recognise the accomplice or has doubts concerning his or her identity.\"</p> <p>I think this deserves to be generally known as the cottaging clause, though obviously it also covers participation in masked orgies.</p> <p>PS \u2013 I shouldn't have to add this, but comments which attempt to portray the whole church as enabling paedophilia will be removed. Deal.</p>",
  "<p>A secondary school's teacher training trip to Spain has been cancelled after adverse publicity, the head teacher announced today.</p> <p>Teaching staff at Edensor technology college, in Longton, Staffordshire, were due to fly out to Marbella today for a two-day conference.

Phew! Who says Belgium's boring?</p> <p>In news of actual relevance to this game: Louis Saha will get his first start for his new club and, if form is anything to by, will be back in the Everton quack's office by 6.53pm this evening. Lescott, despite his error-strewn performance in the first leg retains his place but Yobo won't be able to help out his old club with another own goal unless he's sprung from bench-warming duties. Everton's record signing, Marouane Fellaini, is cup-tied so also won't be able to face his former side. Steven Pienaar, however, is considered fit enough for the bench after recovering from a broken toe.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Standard Liege:</strong> Aragon, Dante, Onyewu, Dalmat, Camozzato, Sarr, Nicaise, Defour, Witsel, Jovanovic, Mbokani. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Devriendt, Goreux, Toama, Mikulic, Benko, Ingrao, Mangala.</p> <p><strong>Everton:</strong> Howard, Hibbert, Jagielka, Lescott, Baines, Osman, Neville, Cahill, Arteta, Yakubu, Saha<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Nash, Yobo, Castillo, Nuno Valente, Pienaar, Rodwell, Anichebe.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Peter Sippel (Germany)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>An email:</strong> \"In the photo above, David Moyes looks kind of like Mark E.

Meanwhile, on the pitch, they're off.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Some team news amendments: the Liege keeper is actually a chap called Espinoza. They've lined up fairly defensively, with a 4-1-3-2 formation. Yakubu makes the most of the space they've left on the wings and plays a good ball to Arteta on the left wing. After some shilly shallying, it goes into the box before Yakubu goes flying, half after a penalty. The referee reckons a goal kick is more the order of the day, though.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Ah, no Espinoza is his surname, Aragon his first. Very confusing. Liege are sitting back, Everton are pushing up and, so far, most of the Everton players are playing the ball to Arteta as if to say, \"Well, you're our best player: do something with it\". He ends up with the ball on the D and it breaks to Yakubu, briefly, before it is cleared.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Louis Saha isn't injured yet. Baines, meanwhile, plays it back to Arteta whose cross is cleared by Sarr. It's the third time the ball has gone into the Liege box in these opening moments, which must be encouraging for David Moyes.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> \"Has Moyes picked Baines and Hibbert at full-back in homage Belgium's boy-sized hero sent to do a man's job, namely Tintin?\" chortles Gary Naylor. \"I'm not sure about the Thompson Twins, Yakubu and Saha up front: Everton play best in a 4-1-3-1-1 formation with a screen for the fragile back four and a free rein for Cahill to make his late runs into the box,\" he continues, doing my job for me. On the pitch, Neville plays a poor pass to Osman, which is intercepted by Nicaise (I think). He bombs up the pitch but an attempted chip over the Everton defence goes into Howard's arms.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Dalmat, dangerous in the first leg, brilliantly wriggles free of both Lescott and Neville and charges into the box. He flicks it back Mbokani, who can't get a decent shot away as a result of Jagielka's challenge. Worrying for Everton.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Louis Saha bursts past Nicaise, storms into the area, then sends a shot sailing into the crowd. Good stuff; poor finish. \"This query might have a better home in the Knowledge section but I've noticed that the Everton XI and bench has representatives from 5 continents. I wonder if any other team (perhaps Blackburn?) have beaten this and done all six?\" remarks Elliot Jacobs, a man with perhaps too much time on his hands.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Much like Everton are relying on Arteta, Liege are depending on Dalmat. They send him free down the right and he knocks it back Camozzato, who sends a cross into the area. Jovanovic goes down in that very area with Hibbert in attendance, but nothing doing says the ref. By the way, if these word pictures aren't enough for you, there are actual pictures of tonight's Uefa Cup action <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2008/oct/02/uefa.tottenhamhotspur\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Hibbert has a crack from distance and it bobbles about a bit, confusing keeper Espinoza, who makes a mess of the save. There's no-one nearby to take advantage, though. Then there's an appeal for a penalty at the Everton end (for hand ball), before Saha earns a free-kick at the other when he's knocked over. Defour earns a yellow card when he comes within seconds of punching the referee in the face. An exciting minute, readers.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> The free-kick is shoddy in the extreme - it dribbles into the wall, where it hits Tim Cahill who is having a lie down. Need I really tell you what happens when Neville has a follow-up shot? Liege run up the other end but Defour's cross doesn't find Mbokani.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> \"You've had that email address since you were nine? You had email at age nine? You're either very young or you were a child prodigy genius who got a job at the Pentagon while the rest of us were getting excited by the ZX81. I don't know which thought depresses me more,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst. Both are true, Robin. I just spend my time hacking these report out to fill in the time when I'm not at the Pentagon. Everton launched a free-kick into the box, by the way. It was too high and went into Espinoza's arms.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Standard Liege 1-0 Everton (agg 3-2) (Witsel, 23)</strong> Defour has a swirling long range shot, which is stopped well by Howard but it falls to Jovanovic who, brilliantly, stands the ball up at the back post - chipping the entire Everton defence - allowing Witsel to stuff it home.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> That, in the parlance of the football pundit, has really knocked the wind out of Everton's sails. It was Liege's first meaningful attack and they scored from it. It wasn't Howard's fault - his first save was as good as could be expected in the circumstances - however the rest of the Everton defence needed to close down Jovanovic far more quickly than they did. Having said that, his ball to the back post was exquisite.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> \"We know Saha is not injured yet six minutes in, but what about 20 minutes in? I think you need to have a Saha injury update every time you post just so your readers will know that he is, in fact, not injured yet,\" writes Bryan T, which confused me greatly as I thought I was emailing myself. Well, Bryan, he's not injured yet and he's just tried to get onto the end of a ball dinked into the Liege box. He doesn't manage it, nor does he injure himself in so doing - so there's both a minus and plus to the move.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Arteta is trying to pull the strings - aided by the fact that he's moved into the central midfield slot, swapping with Tim Cahill who's gone out left. Unfortunately, a ball that could have been brilliant from the Spaniard is thwarted by the fact the ref's whistle went a good minute before he played it. Everton are screwed here, aren't they?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> \"Is Phil Neville's career a 15 year odyssey to prove that he has never been good enough to play for the teams for which he is selected?\" writes increasingly bitter Everton fan Gary Naylor. \"Not good enough for England, nor Manchester United, nor Everton - what is his right level? Stockport County? I wish he'd stuck to cricket.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Liege are looking both settled and comfortable at the moment. Their midfield is particularly strong - when not coming within moments of slapping referees - and they've pushed Everton back into their own half. The pattern of play involves the Everton back four passing it amongst themselves then hoofing it up the pitch, where it fails to reach Yakubu or Saha, who's still not injured.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Hibbert bucks the trend by taking the ball to the byline, his cross is cleared, it falls to Neville and then he slips it to Saha. He has a decent sight of goal but doesn't control the bobbling ball and sends a weak shot in. He looks rusty. Uninjured but rusty.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Neville finds himself alone in the midfield. There's not a player anywhere near him. He pauses, has a quick think, then passes it straight to Nicaise. For about the fifth time this evening. Liege race up the other end, win a throw-in, but can't make much of it.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Camozzato, or Marcos, depending on which name he's using today, thumps over a brilliant cross to Mbokani. He goes up with Howard, who gets a fist to the ball, before the striker is wrongly flagged offside. No matter, Camozzato, or Marcos depending on etc and so forth ... , gets the ball back and glides into the box. He elects to thump the ball into the crowd, rather than at the goal, oddly. Saha is still fit.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> A long ball sails over Saha's head and Yakubu thinks about going for it, then doesn't. Espinoza claims, clears, then goes back to daydreaming. Camozzato, or Marcos depending on etc and so forth ... , whips in another good cross to Mbokani on the penalty spot. His header is wayward, though, and Jovanovic can't get onto the end of it either. Bit of a let off for Everton.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Yakubu is fouled 40 yards out and in the centre of the pitch. The ball is worked to Hibbert, whose cross is charged down for a corner. With unerring accuracy, Arteta picks out 'keeper Espinoza.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Mbokani runs onto a through ball into the box but Jagielka puts in a great saving tackle to send the ball out for a corner. The reason Liege had the ball? Yakubu had come back into the midfield to 'help out' and had gifted it to them. Cahill's doing nothing on the left, by the way. Arteta hasn't found his range and Saha is still not injured. One minute of extra time added.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Peep, peep:</strong> That's it for the first half. It may well be it for Everton as well.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>A half-time email:</strong> \"Re: Gary Naylor's tactical email. Fair point about that 4-1-3-1-1, except that the thing that made it work so well the past few years - a stout bald Irishman - is no longer available. Problems with Howard and the back four this season aside, not nearly enough attention is paid to how much we miss Lee Carsley,\" says Ryan Jones all the way from USA! USA! USA!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>MBM regular</strong> and Everton fan Gary Naylor is beginning to get into that kind of angrily morose mood you tend to get into when your team is on the verge of sliding ignominiously out of the Cup. \"Everton are a bit lucky to have nil at the moment,\" he says. \"At the start of the season, at least we were scoring as well as conceding - the nightmare scenario of a fragile defence and a toothless attack looms. Moyes needs to earn his money in the next hour or so.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>He's not the only one, either:</strong> \"Man, first we panic buy a player who would have cost \u00a35m before his clash with Liverpool (Fellaini: \u00a315m),\" writes Darren Holliday before winding himself up then really getting in the mood for a <strong>RANT</strong>. \"Then we play a disgraceful home derby. This week the players openly ask Moyes what the deal is with his contract ... no answer to that one. Just now we are playing as badly as we have all season and look second best to a team from Belgium. And at this very second I'm listening to random French conversation darting out of my speakers as the BetFair internet broadcast quite strangely just leaves us hanging there among the crowd staring at an empty pitch ... oh, and now awful Europoop trance is blaring out of the stadium.\" He signs off saying he's off to make some tea but, really, I think he might be rigging up some kind of gun-drawing contraption, shaving his head, and repeating \"Are you looking at me,\" into the mirror over and over again.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Across the other side of the desk</strong> my colleague James Dart is busily uploading pictures for you to look at. It would be a shame if he was putting all that work in for nothing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2008/oct/02/uefa.tottenhamhotspur\">so go and have a look and keep us all happy</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>We're off again:</strong> Saha is still fit.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Neville is penalised for a foul when, actually, he got to the ball first and made minimal contact with the opposition player. It's been that sort of night for him, really. It's raining too. Hard. It's not getting much better for Everton here.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Next Arteta gets done for handball in a dangerous position when under no pressure. The free-kick is launched into the box, it bobbles about, then Nicaise is penalised for hand-ball - it actually bounced off his knee when he was in a decent shot-taking sort of a position.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Dalmat goes on another run up the right and looks up to see what's on. He finds his centre-back, Onyewu, on the edge of the box, looking up eagerly. Dalmat frowns and strokes the ball into touch. A few seconds later Liege win a throw-in of their own. That man Onyewu takes it and concedes a foul throw. What an odd couple of minutes for the central defender.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> In the last two minutes, this is what has happened: nothing. Everton are in trouble</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Arteta has caught Neville's disease - he keeps passing to Liege players. Still, no matter, Yakubu's got it. What's he going to do with it? He's going to ping it well over Saha's head and into the corner where the Liege goalkeeper chases it down. He mucks about with it for a bit, and allows it roll out for a goal kick. Saha, still fit, looked on at his antics as if he thought he should do something but wasn't sure what.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Everton win a corner, thanks to good chasing work by Cahill, and Arteta manages to bend the ball out of play. Hmmm.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Dante runs up the left and completely does Hibbert. A nutmeg from the Liege left-back that left the Everton right-back looking a total mug. His shot to the near post is saved by Howard, who turns defence into an attack that finishes with Yakubu heading well wide.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> To cries of \"Ole\", Standard Liege pass the ball amongst themselves while the Everton players chase shadows. Again, it's worked to Dante, who wins a corner. From it, Liege try one or two charged-down shots but can't get an effort on goal.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Anichebe is warming himself up while, on the pitch, Hibbert indulges himself with the sort of agricultural rugby tackle you would more normally see at Twickenham. He has a brief shout at no-one in particular then is subbed for Anichebe, presumably allowing Neville to go to right back.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Nice touch from Arteta, he dinks the ball over Marcos allowing Baines to run onto it but he fires a shot well over. Everton are now playing 4-3-3 with Saha the prong of the three-man attack.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Pienaar is getting his kit on as Everton win a corner from Liege, who are struggling to adjust to Everton's new formation. When it is eventually taken, the keeper comes and flaps, it falls to Anichebe. He shoots and it is deflected over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Standard Liege 1-1 Everton (3-3 agg) (Jagielka 67):</strong> The keeper flaps again from the ensuing corner, drops the ball, has two unsuccessful air grabs at the ball, and then watches aghast as Jagielka toe pokes it in.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> News of that goal would have come to you quicker had I not hit the wrong button on the computer - sorry about that. Meanwhile, Saha is down! He's clutching his head in what looks like real pain after being flattened by a Liege player.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Saha is, not unpredictably, off. Pienaar is on. It was Onyewu who nobbled him. Can Everton get the second goal they need in the next 19 minutes?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Just seconds before Everton scored, this email from Ryan Jones came in: \"Hi Tom. I'm going to a quick staff meeting now, it should take five to 10 minutes. When I get back, I'm convinced, Everton will have scored and shifted the momentum.\" Suspicious. Very suspicious.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Has David Moyes just earned himself an extra few quid on that new contract he hasn't signed? Certainly his tactical change, by putting three up front (I know, it's hardly radical, but still ... ) has caused Liege no end of problems. It's led to one goal and Everton are now getting behind the Liege defence. However, they're also looking more vulnerable at the back.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Ryan Jones' meeting is over and he's feeling triumphant. \"HA!,\" he says. \"Good thing I didn't try to predict the goal-scorer. Among the players on the pitch, Jagielka would've been about my 14th pick - but I will take it!\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>PENALTY!</strong> Jovanovic plays a one-two with Defour, then ploughs into the box. He connects with Leighton Baines' knee and goes down. Baines didn't do much wrong, Jovanovic was clever, but it was still a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Standard Liege 2-1 Everton (4-3) (Jovanovic 79)</strong> A poor penalty that's low and straight-ish. Tim Howard, however, elects to dive under it. Everton need a goal to force this into extra time.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> \"If Phil Neville had stuck with cricket, as Gary Naylor has suggested (31 min), and been successful - his Wikipedia page claims that 'one of his former coaches called him the greatest schoolboy cricketer he'd ever known' - Mr. Naylor would probably be emailing on what might have become of him had he stuck with football, ending his missive with, 'He's a Lancashire lad, too. We could do with him at Everton,'\" reckons Mac Millings. His efforts tonight - mostly running around in circles, giving the ball away and shouting a lot, ineffectually - would probably be just as useless on the square.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> A free-kick is floated into the Everton box. It's cleared up the right and the ball breaks to Yakubu, he begins a few seconds of thoughtful Everton play as they stroke it about waiting for a breakthrough. Arteta thinks he spies it and dinks it to Cahill in the penalty area. He's flagged offside - wrongly - but Onyewu had cleared anyway.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Arteta goes for a screamer. He's 35 yards out, in plenty of space, but his shot is high and wide.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Mbokani gets the ball in the Everton area, has a look at the clock, and realises he doesn't need to do much. So he flicks it from one foot to another a few times, then dribbles back out again. At the other end, Baines sends a cross over from the byline (in fact just over the byline) and the keeper drops it again. Fortunately for him, the ref was wise to Baines' mistake.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Yobo steps out of the dug out to the sound of a Liege fan in the crowd roaring, 'Wahey-hey!' as he, no doubt, contemplates another own goal. Neville comes off in his place.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Dalmat plays a great ball to Jovanovic, who had noticed that most of the Everton players were thinking about attacking, rather than defending. However, he fluffs his shot when Jagielka gets back to deal with him.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> A cross comes over and the Liege keeper punches it half way up the pitch, rather than dropping it as per usual. Then Pienaar nods the ball back into the box and Yakubu can't get there before Onyewu thumps it away.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>90 min+2</strong> A long ball into the Liege box is cleared up well by the keeper. There's a minute left and Everton's goose looks cooked.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min +3:</strong> \"Funny how when Everton leveled the score at 1-1 your photo of David Moyes conveyed the knowing smile of a professional in control. Now he's back to looking like he has a large root vegetable up his ...\" writes Richard H.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min+4:</strong> A last desperate lunge from Everton leads to a corner kick. Arteta lines it up, then hits it straight at the first man. That was Everton's last chance and, as the ref brings his whistle to his lips, they know it. So then, that's it: Everton are out.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p>Admittedly, Everton were handed a tough draw but they could have beaten Liege if they'd been at their best. Unfortunately, perhaps the uncertainty over Moyes' future and that defeat against Liverpool conspired to produce another poor display - something in which Everton seem to be specialising this season. Liege, however, are a very decent side and wouldn't be a bad bet to go all the way and lift the trophy at the end of the season. With two attacking full backs, a good strike force and a midfield that is both solid and creative, they should do well.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p>Thanks for all your emails tonight, I'm off.</p>",

And now it seems that Julianne Moore's new film has <a href=\"http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Julianne_Moores_Blindness_Sparks_Controversy_Among_The_Blind_25562.html\">upset America's National Federation for The Blind</a> with its portrayal of a society in which a disease causes large numbers of people to lose their sight.</p> <p>It seems the organisation is most disgusted over <strong>Blindness</strong>'s depiction of sightless people descending into monstrous crazies as they compete for scant resources at a hastily opened in-house for the newly blind. Moore plays a woman who fakes the loss of her sight in order to join her husband (Mark Ruffalo) in the institution.</p> <p>The movie is directed by City of God's Fernando Meirelles and hits cinemas here on November 28. In the US, it's out this weekend, and doesn't look likely to make a huge mark on the box office chart, given the <a href=\"http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/1188215-blindness/\">distinctly lukewarm reviews</a>. The placard-wielding protestors outside cinemas over the next few days probably won't help much either, although all the controversy over Robert Downey Jr's use of the \"R\" word <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/aug/25/tropicthunder.housebunny\">did nothing to dampen Tropic Thunder's appeal</a>.</p> <p>In other news, it's all about the talking bears in today's Hollywood happenings.

Called, predictably, Pandamonium, the new film will see Black and co-star Angelina Jolie returning to the vocal studio. But Panda fans will have to be patient - the sequel won't be out until June 3 2011.</p> <p>Secondly, Warner Bros has confirmed it is bringing a live-action/CG hybrid of <a href=\"http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a131642/warner-bros-confirms-yogi-bear-film.html?rss\">Hanna-Barbera cartoon Yogi Bear to the big screen</a>. To me, this sounds worryingly like the abominable Garfield movie, which despite the presence of Bill Murray on voice duties was about as pleasurable an experience as an hour and a half spent hunkering down in a tray of cat litter. Still, we can but hope.</p> <p>Warner is also at the centre of suggestions that the follow up to this summer's box office behemoth, The Dark Knight, <a href=\"http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/914/914964p1.html?RSSwhen2008-09-30_154400&amp;RSSid=914964\">could start shooting as early as next year</a>. Warner has already said it wants a third Christopher Nolan Batman film in time for a 2011 release. Could it arrive even earlier? </p> <p>As far as we know right now, Nolan and co haven't even signed on for a third movie as yet, and the 2009 start date remains unconfirmed.

With a place in the interminable group stages at stake, Spurs skipper Ledley King is healthy enough to make a rare appearance in defence after being rested at the weekend for the defeat at Portsmouth.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Wiki-fact which, given it's place of origin, may not be all that factual:</strong> Wis\u0142a's Stadium is located on 22 Reymonta Street in Krak\u00f3w, Poland.

It's warm and dry in Poland, writes minute-by-minute reporter from sanctuary of Farringdon bunker. Will Spurs play a 4-5-1 with Frazier Campbell lining up on the left wing and Lennon on the right? Or will they play a 4-4-2 with Bent and Campbell up front? I don't know about you, but the suspense is killing me.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> I can confirm that Spurs have lined up in a 4-5-1 formation, but with Campbell on the left and Lennon on the right. Depending on which side of the field play is on, one of them moves forward in support of lone frontman Darren Bent. Anyway, enough boring chatter about formations and tactics, I can also confirm that Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes is wearing a blue cap to keep the sun out of his eyes.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Mauro Cantoro body-checks Aaron Lennon, conceding a free-kick about 30 yards out from his own goal, slightly left of centre. Gareth Bale fancies his chances and steps up, only to see his dismal effort blocked by the shins of somebody standing in the Wisla Krakow wall.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> \"I'm living in Krakow at the moment and was walking home when about 200 Tottenham supporters surrounded by about the same amount of insanely armed riot police were being escorted to the stadium about an hour ago,\" writes Graeme O'Connor, in an attempt to provide some hostile big match atmosphere. \"They had full-on tear gas cannisters, shotguns and all had full riot gear on. Not sure if the supporters were going to be that rowdy! I can hear the streams of Wisla Krakow fans about two streets over now as well. Madness altogether.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> A Fraizer Campbell cross is put out for a corner by Junior Diaz and Jermaine Jenas curls the ball into the penalty area. It pings harmlessly around the hinterland of the Wisla Krakow penalty area before being cleared.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Gareth Bale gets forward and whips in a cross from the left that causes no end of panic among the Wisla Krako defenders, who manage to clear despite the presence of Campbell, Bent and Jenas.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> \"Let's hope the Spurs fans don't sing any 'Bent Campbell' songs this afternoon and get themselves into any more trouble,\" writes Mark Andrews. For anyone who may not be aware of it, Tottenham fans are currently being investigated by police and/or the FA for chanting homophobic and racist abuse at Sol Campbell in Fratton Park last weekend. I have no idea whether Sol is black or not, but he's always denied being gay.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Move along to the next bit, folks. Nothing to see here.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Luka Modric latches on to a misplaced pass from a Wisla Krakow defender and tries a shot from distance that's low and wide. Spurs are probably the better of the two teams, but neither of them have settled too well and there's not much in it.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Wandering down the right, Aaron Lennon feeds the overlapping Chris Gunther, but the Welsh international's cross is dreadful. He wins a corner, which yields another. Jermaine Jenas sends the ball into the penalty area and Cleber heads clear for Wisla.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> This. Match. Is. Dreadful.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Tottenham win a free-kick a good way out from the opposition goal. Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate lumber up from the back and start jockeying for position in the penalty area, only to see Gareth Bale address the dead ball and send it flying high over their heads and wide. That's another poor effort.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Pawel Brozek, one of a pair of twins on the Wisla team, has the first shot on target of the game. That it's a feeble effort from distance that Gomes gathers easily tells you all you need to know about the quality on show this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Another free-kick for Spurs from distance. Ever the optimist, Jermaine Jenas has a pop, but in the Wisla goal, Mariusz Pawelek is still able to catch the ball despite the inconvenience of having Jonathan Woodgate hanging out of one of his arms. The Tottenham defender gets deservedly and unnecessarily booked for his troubles and is now <em>[commentator reaches for Big Book Of Cliches]</em> walking the proverbial tightrope.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> I don't mind admitting I haven't the foggiest idea which Wisla player has just been replaced by the substitute Lobodzinski, or why. I hope it was Barcin Basczcynski, because his name is the most difficult to spell.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Wisla Krakow get a free-kick, a little over 30 yards out from the Tottenham goal. The Costa Rican, Junior Diaz, tries his luck, but Gomes saves easily.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> I can confirm that Heurelho Gomes is no longer wearing a blue cap. Although the exact moment he removed it wasn't broadcast on TV, it was probably the most interesting thing to happen in this half.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Spurs are awarded a free-kick in the Wisla right-back position. Standning over it, Jermaine Jenas makes a big show of rubbing his head with both hands three times. Either he's got lice or it's code for: \"I am going to send this ball fizzing into the penalty area at great speed in a bid to win a corner off the head of an opposition defender.\" Assuming it's the latter, his plan works perfectly, but nothing comes from the ensuing corner, which is delivered with such apathy that it fails to clear the first defender.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Wisla Krakow miss two glorious chances to go ahead. The first falls to Radoslaw Sobolewski who, upon being put clean through on goal with only Gomes to beat, attempts to place the ball past the keeper from six or seven yards when <em>[minute-by-minute reporter reaches for 20-20 hindsight goggles]</em> he probably should have blasted it. Moments later, Junior Diaz brings another smart save out of Gomes, shooting diagonally from about 10 yards, under pressure from three Tottenham defenders.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Tottenham's players trudge back to the dressing room still ahead in this tie, but only just. Their performance in the first half has been adequate at best, but despite their best attempts at pinning Wisla inside their own half, they haven't looked like scoring against a fairly ordinary side.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>An upbeat email to brighten up proceedings:</strong> \"Thanks for keeping us working Spurs fans up to date with the match,\" writes Alan F. \"No irony there, by the way, it's much appreciated.

Spurs clear.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> \"What always really killed me about being a Spurs fan was not the pain of losing but the hope of winning,\" writes Jim Brewer. \"Looks like I've got one less thing to worry about this season.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Kleber picks up the ball on one side of the centre-circle and floats a long ball towards the corner for Basczcynski to chase. There's too much welly on it and it bounces wide.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Somebody in a Spurs shirt - Gunther, maybe - lumps a hopeful ball forward, Bent leaps to get a flick on just outside the penalty area and Fraizer Campbell gets in a tangle with his marker and falls over while chasing the scraps. It's an exhibition of total football we've got going on here. Well, total something.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Luca Modric tries a dipping, swerving shot from distance that brings a smartish save out of Pawlelek in the Wisla Krakow goal. Seconds later, at the desk opposite mine, my colleague James Dart perks up and announces that Going For Gold with Henry Kelly is coming back soon, to a television screen near us.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wisla Krakow 0-1 Spurs (Agg: 1-3) (Glowacki 56og)</strong> Hurrah! A goal at last. Near the corner flag on the left-hand side, Gareth Bale sends in a wonderful cross. On the edge of the six yard box, under pressure from Friazer Campbell, Arkadiusz Glowacki sends a diving header past his own goalkeeper, just inside the far post.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Luca Modric picked up a yellow card in the aftermath of that goal, but I'm afraid incompetence precludes me from telling you why.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Wisla go forward through Mauro Cantoro, who feeds the ball to Junior Diaz, who plays it on to Brozak. He's fouled by Gareth Bale, who gets booked. It's a free-kick for Wisla in the Tottenham left-back position, from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Wisla are committing more men forward now, when it's probably too late. Still, it'll increase their own chances of scoring while leaving holes at the back for Tottenham's players to fail dismally to exploit.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Spurs midfielder Didier Zokora picks up a lose ball in the centre circle and gallops into the Wisla half with only one thing on his mind. Bearing down on the left-hand side of goal with the 'keeper on the charge, he attempts to shoot the ball inside the far post, but it wafts a foot or two wide. In the penalty area, Fraizer Campbell politely enquiresof his team-mate why he didn't look up and square the ball. Wisla substitution: Zie\u0144czuk on, Cantoro off.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Darren Bent latches on to a dinked pass from Luka Modric on the right-hand side of the penalty area. Turning Glowacki inside out, he makes from for a shot before sending a diagonal shot fizzing inches wide of the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Spurs substitution:</strong> Fraizer Campbell off, Jamie O'Hara on.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Five commentator Alistair Mann shouts \"BENT!!!!\" at the top of his voice while I'm gazing absentmindedly out the window at the sunset, which is far more interesting than anything on the television. I risk whiplash turning my head too fast, only to see the ball bouncing harmlessly wide of the Wisla goal.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Junior Diaz reacts angrily to a challenge from Aaron Lennon, prompting a mass handbags session in which Didier Zokora takes on the mantlepiece (\u00a9 Rio Ferdinand 2008) normally worn by referee's assistant John Terry and attempts to sort it out. The names Zokora, Lennon and Diaz are all written in the notebook of the actual referee, Alexandru Dan Tudor. Tottenham substitution: Huddlestone on, Modric off.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Great play from Wisla Krakow. A cross-field Hollywood pass is volleyed into the path of Pavel Brozek on the edge of the six-yard box. Only the timely intervention of Ledley King prevents the striker from scoring.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Wisla blow another couple of good scoring chances, with Gomes saving in a Gordon Banks-from-Pele-esque fashion from a corner, diving low to his left, changing direction in mid-air and tipping the ball onto the crossbar. Moments later, Boguski volleys high and wide from 12 or 13 yards when hitting the target seemed easier.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Wisla Krakow 1-1 Spurs (Agg: 2-3) (Pawel Brozek 82)</strong> Unbelievably shambolic defending from Tottenham (OK, all too believablely shambolic), whose centre halves fail dismally to deal with a simple Junior Diaz ball over the top, before allowing Pawel Brozek to nip between them and lob the ball over the onrushing Gomes and into the abandoned goal.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> It's squeaky bum time for Tottenham now - one more goal for Wisla would make it 3-3 on aggregate and send the tie into extra time. From a corner, the ball drops for Pawel Brozek, who is unable to get any pace on a header which goes straight into the grateful arms of Gomes.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Wisla appeal for a penalty as Pawel Brozek goes down in a tangle with Michael Dawson, who's just come on as a substitute for Spurs. There was no foul an the referee waves play on.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Several hundred Spurs fans cover their eyes as the ball fizzes inches over the crossbar of their team's goal.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> There's two minutes of added time left and Spurs are under relentless pressure from Wisla, whose fans could be forgiven for wondering why their team only started playing decent football after going a goal down this afternoon. They could easily have won this tie but for their excessive caution and some seriously wayward finishing.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! It's all over - Spurs have scraped their way through to the group stages of football's most farcically formatted competition, the Uefa Cup. Their fans shouldn't be too pleased with themselves or their team - this was a poor effort that was about as convincing as an argument in favour of Palin for vice president that doesn't feature the expression \"Milf\".</p>",
  "<p>A group of leading economists today called on EU leaders to mount a coordinated Europe-wide rescue operation for the continent's banks to prevent a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" crisis spiralling out of control.</p> <p>The 10 economists, including Willem Buiter, a professor at the London School of Economics and a former Bank of England rate-setter, warn that Europe faces a repeat of the 1930s, with the savings of hundreds of millions threatened unless governments act together.</p> <p>Their \"call to action\", published by the DIW institute in Berlin, comes as France summons British, German and Italian leaders to an emergency summit in Paris this weekend to draw up a common response to the financial crisis.</p> <p>The French finance minister Christine Lagarde last night rebutted reports that president Nicolas Sarkozy, the current EU president, would present a \u20ac300bn (\u00a3236m) bail-out plan similar to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">the US rescue scheme</a>, dubbed a \"Euro-TARP\" or troubled asset relief programme.</p> <p>The 10 economists stop short of demanding a similar scheme, saying the key problem in Europe is high leverage among international banks rather than lack of liquidity. \"Hence the EU contribution must be centred on a recapitalisation of the banking sector, through the injection of public equity or through mandatory debt-to-equity conversions,\" they said.</p> <p>They added: \"This has to be done at the EU level (eg through the European Investment Bank). The current approach of rescuing one institution after another with national funds will lead to a Balkanisation of the European banking sector.\"</p> <p>In a dire warning to policymakers, they wrote: \"Trust among financial institutions is disappearing and there are risks that fear will spread more widely. Turmoil in financial markets must be stopped before it causes major damage to the real economy.

I was sold to Earlshall where Reuben Smith, a racist stable hand, mistreated me horribly. My knees were finished so I was made to pull a London cab. It was terrible work and someone really should have called the RSPCA as my eyes started playing up because of the darkness. Still it could have been worse. One day I came across an emaciated Ginger in the street. \"Is it because I is ginger?\" he gasped before dying in front of me.<br>I got sold again and times was very hard during the apartheid regime.

  "<p>Google the term \"community investment\" and you will be directed to the corporate social responsibility websites of some of our largest banks. But while the credit crunch bites deep into their reserves, with some banks disappearing altogether, community organisations must be wondering whether they have seen the last of any \"investment\" from the big banks for some time to come. Community investment was always an odd term for the banks to use to describe their charitable works. Exactly what return on investment were the banks looking for?</p> <p>Now, the meaning of the term community investment is being reinvented by a publication being launched at the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/\">Financial Services Authority</a> today. Called Community Investment, the publication describes how communities can invest in themselves, using a little used and poorly understood corporate form: the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/Pages/Doing/small_firms/MSR/Societies/index.shtml \">industrial and provident society</a> (IPS). <br><br>The publication defines community investment as the practice of communities investing capital in business ventures serving a social or community purpose. These might be geographic communities, such as <a href=\"http://www.witherslack.org\">Witherslack</a> in the Lake District, where members of the local community have invested \u00a325,000 of their own money in creating a village store, or they might be communities of interest, such as the 8,000 supporters of small-scale farming who invested nearly \u00a3750,000 in share capital to buy <a href=\"http://www.fordhallfarm.com/\">Fordhall Farm</a> and turn it into <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/jul/01/ruralaffairs.conservationandendangeredspecies\">England's first community-owned farm</a>. </p> <p>Interest in using share structures as a way of raising capital for social enterprises has been growing steadily since the high-profile share launch of Caf\u00e9direct plc in 2004.</p> <p>The government made sure that <a href=\"http://www.cicregulator.gov.uk/ \">Community Interest Companies</a> (CICs) could raise share capital, and is currently setting up a \u00a320m risk capital investment fund that will buy shares in social enterprises. But despite all this interest there are practical problems using plc or CIC formats for community share launches, and there are fewer than ten cases of social enterprises successfully using these formats. </p> <p>In contrast, the number of IPSs with community investment has more than doubled since 2004. There are now at least 49 IPSs that have used community investment to finance initiatives ranging from football clubs to wind farms, with a further 12 initiatives currently under development. Altogether, they have raised over \u00a347m from their 65,000+ members. Whilst some of these IPSs, like Fordhall Farm, have gained national attention, most are low-profile expressions of community solidarity. </p> <p>Back in 2002 a government review of the third sector dismissed the IPS structure as \"a useful, but underused and outdated legal form\". Now, HM Treasury are in the middle of reforming IPS legislation and the FSA, in its role as the regulator of IPSs, is showing a renewed commitment to the format.</p> <p>The principle of community investment is nothing new. The co-operative movement and building societies were founded on this concept of mutuality. It is ironic that the two UK banks that have failed so far, Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, were both building societies until they were demutualised back in the 1990s. In contrast, none of the remaining building societies have gone under in the current crisis. Maybe it is time to rediscover the power of community investment.</p> <p>\u2022 Jim Brown is the author of Community Investment: using IPS legislation, published by Co-operatives UK. The paper will be launched today by Iain Wright MP, minister for communities and local government, at the FSA</p>",
  "<p><strong>Matthew McEachran </strong>at <strong>Kaupthing </strong>said of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/marksspencer.retail1\">Marks &amp; Spencer's latest trading update</a>: \"This is not as bad as feared. They indicate that they are running more promotions and offering better value in non-food. This has margin implications. They say they are confident in their autumn/winter offer though. </p> <p>\"If performance at the top line can be held at current levels without a further drop-off, there would be faint hopes of the dividend being held. Overall this statement is better than feared, and there are no awful outlook comments in relation to a bad end to September, albeit based on numerous anecdotes we feel it did happen.\"</p> <p>However, he said City forecasts for pretax profits this year may still need to come down from \u00a3695m to \u00a3635m.</p> <p><strong>Philip Dorgan </strong>at <strong>Panmure Gordon </strong>said: \"This statement is probably as bullish as it could be, given that the trading environment is the worst for 30 years and that its food business's structural flaws are being exposed. Pricing issues are being addressed, costs are being cut and the capex excesses reined back. We are not sellers of the shares, because we believe that the problems in clothing are no more structural than usual ... We believe that M&amp;S has enormous brand value and that this is worth more than the current share price.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The problems in clothing are well documented, being part consumer, part weather, part internal (although the statement is optimistic about this season's ranges), but it is the problems in food which could create the largest hole in profits. We expect all quoted food retailers to show margin declines in the next 18 months and there appears little hope for M&amp;S's high price/high cost format.\"</p> <p>He is forecasting pretax profits of \u00a3595m this year.</p> <p>\"The move to stock brands, while good-intentioned, is flawed and doomed to failure. M&amp;S's prices are too high, its range is too narrow and attempts by the previous managing director to widen the range has merely exposed the creaking supply chain and created more problems in terms of gaps in shelves.\" </p> <p><strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr </strong>at <strong>Charles Stanley </strong>stockbrokers warned that he could see \"no light at the end of the tunnel\" for M&amp;S. </p> <p>\"M&amp;S's problem is its age-old problem. It is focused on the middle ground, and the middle ground is being torn up between the companies at the bottom and the companies at the top.\"</p> <p><strong>Richard Edwards </strong>at <strong>Citi </strong>said: \"While the food business looks far from being fixed, the progress on cost removal does give this profit &amp; loss shape some resilience. Lower capex guidance ... implies the end (for now) of the store modernisation programme and a slowdown in the space growth dynamic. This action suggests management's view that the full-year dividend for 2008/09 will be maintained.\" </p> <p><strong>Rob Mann </strong>at <strong>Collins Stewart </strong>said: \"Part of the underperformance in food has been self-inflicted through poor operational execution. As such we believe that despite the positioning of the offer there is a recovery that can be implemented in food through a reduction in wastage, improved availability and greater promotional penetration. The new head of food, John Dixon, has been at M&amp;S 22 years and with a background as a food buyer deserves more than a quarter to instigate a recovery.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Although trading momentum will remain negative in the short term and there is a risk of more downgrades to 2009/10 we see medium term value with an attractive recovery story beginning to form.\" </p> <p><strong>Keith Bowman </strong>at <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown </strong>Stockbrokers said: \"Whilst these are not exactly glowing figures, they are not the over-the-cliff disaster which many investors had feared.</p> <p>\"That said, profit margins are coming under pressure via increased discounting and the outlook for both the UK and global economies appears to be weakening almost by the day. For now, and despite a near 50% drop in the share price over just the last 6 months, market consensus opinion currently denotes a weak hold.\"</p> <p><strong>Nick Bubb </strong>at <strong>Pali International </strong>said: \"Now, the like-for-like sales have only been achieved by price-cutting, so gross margin guidance is weak, down 100bps for the year (even worse than our -90bps assumption), despite buying/sourcing gains in clothing. There is no indication of how the -100bps is split between food and clothing, but we suspect food has taken the brunt of the gross margin pain.</p> <p>\"However, there have been useful cost savings ... On this basis, the 22.5p dividend is safe for this year, although next year is a different story: we still expect a divi cut to 16p next year. And the market will like the slashing of capex, from a planned \u00a3850m to \u00a3700m this year, which will leave net debt at \"only\" around \u00a33.3bn at year-end.\"</p> <p>He added: \"With the worst Christmas for at least 30 years coming up for non-food retailers, we wouldn't get carried away, but the shares have fallen far enough in the short-term and M&amp;S is off the hook for the time being: we are moving from sell to neutral.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/02/law.health\">Debbie Purdy</a> today launches a landmark legal bid to clarify the law on assisted suicide. Purdy, 45, who has primary progressive multiple sclerosis, is asking the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to clarify the law in England and Wales that makes it an offence to help someone kill themselves. She wants to ensure her husband is not prosecuted for helping her travel abroad to end her life \u2013 assisting someone to die carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7644094.stm\">BBC Radio 4</a> this morning, Purdy said the law as it currently stands may force her to travel to Switzerland \u2013 where assisted suicide is legal \u2013 while she is still physically healthy enough to do so, but before she is emotionally ready to die:</p> <blockquote> <p>I don't know what's going to happen to me in terms of the progression of my disease, and I don't know that my life will ever become unbearable.

  "<p>Following the highlights of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/01/championsleague.villarreal\">Celtic's defeat at the hands of Villarreal</a> at the Madrigal, ITV presenter and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jun/14/features16.theguide\">dignity-free Everest Windows shill</a> Craig Doyle asked pundit Robbie Earle to explain why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic\">Celtic</a> find it so difficult to win away from home in the Champions League. Earle mumbled something or other about teams setting out their stalls differently on their travels, but offered no reason <em>why</em> this should be - before embarking on a paean to Celtic's holy goalie Artur Boruc that was all well and good, but had nothing whatsoever to do with the question posed.</p> <p>Celtic's run of defeats on the road in the Champions League proper now extends to a toe-curling 17 out of 18, with just a draw against Barcelona several years ago going some small way towards hiding their shame. While reverses at the Madrigal, Nou Camp, San Siro (x3), Allianz Arena, Stadio Delle Alpe and Old Trafford are not disgraceful, the law of averages suggests eight matches at such imposing venues should have yielded more than a solitary point. Elsewhere in Europe, defeat after defeat at the hands of eminently beatable teams such as FC Copenhagen, Lyon, Shakhtar Donetsk (x2), Porto, Rosenborg and the perennially hopeless Anderlecht give every indication there's a lot more to Celtic's appalling run than a paucity of quality among the club's ranks. </p> <p>So why exactly is it that Celtic in particular and sports teams in general endure such hardship when it comes to playing outside their own manor, with many going so far as to approach a games in completely different ways depending on whether they're playing in their own stadium in front of their own fans or in somebody else's in front of theirs? When push comes to shove, a game of football is just that: a game of football, so why adopt a different, negative tack, as many managers do, for no other reason than that you're playing away from home? After all, look at the success enjoyed by Hull City last weekend when they took the game to Arsenal in their own backyard. Let's examine the relevant factors:</p> <p><strong>Travel: </strong> Obviously jet-lag can affect a travelling team's performances, as can the effects of long coach journeys endured by impoverished sides that can't afford overnight accommodation. Unfortunately for Celtic, they are neither poor nor far away enough to cite arduous EasyJet flights through different time zones as a legitimate excuse.</p> <p><strong>Accommodation: </strong> They might not arrive in town brandishing 35-point lists of ludicrous demands and an official food-taster, but Celtic aren't going to put their players up in a motorway Travel Lodge either. Unless opposition fans are putting late-night calls through to the rooms of visiting players while beating drums and honking car-horns outside their five-star digs, the excuse of being unable to sleep in a strange bed doesn't really wash either. </p> <p><strong>Climate: </strong> Celtic hail from Scotland, where on a good day, the cold would freeze the balls off a brass monkey. The foreigners on their books ought to relish any opportunity to play in the more temperate climates on offer around Europe. Next. </p> <p><strong>Altitude: </strong> As long as geography precludes Ecuador and Bolivia from fielding sides in the Champions League, this is also unlikely to factor against Celtic or anyone else when they play away from home.</p> <p><strong>Pitches: </strong> Yes, it's true that they vary a little in width and length (younger readers may not be aware of this, but the playing surface at Arsenal's previous home, Highbury, was famously only 14ft wide), but never in shape. They're all rectangular, generally covered in grass and each has a regulation-sized goal at each end. Get on with it. </p> <p><strong>Atmosphere: </strong> Whether you're being welcomed to hell or Hull, playing in a strange stadium where the vast majority of the assembled throng are cheering on the home side and baying for your blood is likely to intimidate all but the most psychologically strong. But should it? Despite their unofficial status as 12th man, opposition supporters play no part in the actual game, so professional athletes used to playing in front of partisan crowds should not let their performances be adversely affected by the din generated by thousands of people they don't know. Indeed, it could be argued that if anything, it ought to spur them on to greater things. Of course there are <em>some</em> people whose performances can be affected by the atmosphere created by opposition fans \u2026 </p> <p><strong>Officials: </strong> Possibly the only factor that can legitimately be held accountable for the fact that, when two relatively evenly matched sides meet, the home team is expected to win. Only the most na\u00efve football-goer would dispute the fact that referees and their assistants are bigger homers than the patriarch of the Simpson family. But while there is no doubt that an understandable desire on the part of many officials to avoid hearing 50,000 people question their parentage or sexual proclivities in unison leads to many home-town decisions, there have been few if any suggestions that Celtic have suffered more than most at the hands of referees away from home. </p> <p>So having put them under the microscope and stared at them in a Grissomesque fashion at great length, what can we deduce from this analysis of Assorted Things That Seem To Influence Teams Playing Away From Home But Shouldn't? It's difficult to avoid the conclusion that the only thing preventing Celtic and their ilk winning more often on their travels are simple human frailties: insecurity and fear.</p>",
  "<p>It will not be the Sherlock Holmes on film many remember - the suave Basil Rathbone to the bumbling Nigel Bruce - but a new big budget action movie will be faithful to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/11/arthurconandoyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s original stories, its director Guy Ritchie said yesterday.</p> <p>Shooting is about to begin in London on the Warner Bros movie with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdowneyjr\">Robert Downey Jr</a> taking the lead alongside Jude Law, now confirmed as Dr Watson. Kelly Reilly will play Watson's love interest, Mary, Rachel McAdams has signed on to play the traditional object of Holmes' affections, Irene Adler, while Mark Strong is Blackwood, the \"unremittingly evil\" baddie.</p> <p>Yesterday those involved gathered in London's Freemason's Hall - where scenes will also be shot - to talk about the movie, one of two rival planned productions. The other will be a comedy with Sacha Baron Cohen and Will Ferrell. Ritchie's film, to be released in 2010, will be based on an original comic book currently being penned by Sherlock Holmes producer Lionel Wigram.</p> <p>Ritchie said he was a huge fan of the stories. \"I really knew Sherlock Holmes from tape - I wasn't a very good reader - and what I had imagined in my mind was not exactly what I'd seen previously on film.\"</p> <p>He added: \"We're trying to be as authentic as we can to the original Sherlock Holmes. We've tried to include a bit more Conan Doyle in it.\"</p> <p>Ritchie, who has had the most success with cockney gangster movies (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and RocknRolla) said the new movie, his biggest to date, would not be \"a traditional Guy Ritchie thing.\"</p> <p>Downey Jnr said his received pronunciation was just fine and that he would be drawing on his experiences filming Chaplin, for which he was nominated for an Oscar, to create a believably British character. His Holmes, he said, would focus less on the repressed English side of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character, and more on his status as \"a bohemian\" and \"a patriot\". He went on to admit the character was \"just such a weirdo.\" He added: \"as a matter of fact Mrs Downey said that if you read the description of the guy - quirky and nuts - it could be a description of me on some days.\"</p> <p>He also said the film was a fresh take on Holmes which was \"kind of returning to a little bit more of what the stories always had in them and the scale of them and the canvas is so huge I just don't think they've ever had the budget to fully tell the story in a really big, fun way.\"</p> <p>The actor, now a proper action movie lead after the success of Iron Man, joked that he was \"clearly going to do it better\" than anyone before him. He said he was not that familiar with Sherlock Holmes before accepting the part. \"The more I read about him, the more overwhelmed I was by the weight of it and the amount of people who will be watching to see if it's gotten right.\"</p> <p>There will be plenty of fighting (Holmes was adept at bare knuckle boxing and an unusual form of jujitsu) and the film will explore the \"co-dependency\" and genuine love between Holmes and Watson. The only reticence yesterday was over what Holmes will wear - the deerstalker is out but lips are sealed about what is in.</p>",
  "<p>A woman who has multiple sclerosis will today launch a landmark legal bid to ensure her husband is not prosecuted for helping her travel abroad to end her life.</p> <p>Debbie Purdy, 45, who has primary progressive multiple sclerosis, is asking the director of public prosecutions (DPP) to clarify the law in England and Wales.

  "<p>Conscription in the <a href=\"http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/\">Israeli defence forces</a> (IDF) is a particularly sensitive topic in Israel; unsurprisingly, given that the majority of families will send at least one of their offspring to don the uniform in defence of their country. Refusal to play the game and join up is tantamount to treason in many people's eyes, so much so that politicians have realised there is huge political capital to be made out of relentlessly hounding and scapegoating those who fail to do their time in the forces.</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1020999.html\">target</a> for the wrath of the righteous is New Profile, an NGO dedicated to assisting would-be soldiers to avoid the draft. The pursuit of New Profile is part of the all-out war being waged by the authorities against the burgeoning section of Israeli youth that successfully eludes the IDF's clutches. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=902122&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4\">Last year</a>, nearly a third of eligible males managed to evade enlistment, causing a national outcry that has yet to die down.</p> <p>The main culprits are the children of Israel's <a href=\"http://www.ynet.co.il/english/articles/0,7340,L-3481004,00.html\">ultra-orthodox community</a>, which has been exempt from serving ever since Ben-Gurion caved in to the demands of the haredi leaders during Israel's formative years. Ben-Gurion's accession to the <a href=\"http://www.tzemachdovid.org/gedolim/jo/tpersonality/chazonish.html\">Chazon Ish</a>'s request covered a few hundred young men who preferred to study in seminaries rather than take up arms for the fledgling state; now, however, almost 50,000 young Israelis can invoke this ruling in order to avoid serving.</p> <p>But pursuing the haredi community is not a politically expedient move for today's politicians. They are well aware of the collective power that the ultra-orthodox wield, and are far too diplomatically adroit to make waves in such potentially deadly waters. Instead, they have opted to go for the soft underbelly of the refusenik brigade: those who claim conscientious objection as the reason for their reluctance to serve.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE15/049/1999\">Conscientious objectors</a> are not a new phenomenon in Israel, although this summer has seen a particularly vocal and well-publicised slew of draftees opting to spend time in military jail rather than lace up their combat boots and embark on a tour of duty. New Profile says that the assistance it provides to those seeking a way out of military service is based on the group's advocacy of pacifism and \"determined peace politics\", and it insists that it is simply endorsing \"the basic human right to conscientious objection\".</p> <p>Incitement to draft-dodging is a crime under Israeli law, and the activities of New Profile appear to fall well within the definition. The group provides all kinds of advice on how new recruits can achieve a \"21 [unfit to serve] profile\" to convince the army psychologists of their unsuitability. Their actions have been widely condemned, especially in the rightwing, nationalist sector of the Israeli press, where commentators have had a field day painting New Profile and its devotees as workshy traitors, hell-bent on destroying Israeli society from within.</p> <p>There is, of course, the danger that New Profile's services are being used by those teenagers for whom the mere thought of making altruistic efforts is anathema; namely the rich and spoilt offspring of the Israeli upper class, whose resistance to the call of duty continues a long tradition of pampered youth worming their way out of national service. However, that an NGO, which provides much-needed support to real conscientious objectors, should be labelled criminal shows up its accusers as being motivated more by malice than by well thought out, rational intentions.</p> <p>Being forced to serve just because it's the done thing does not make it acceptable or palatable to every young Israeli, all the more so when the matter of aiding the illegal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/israelandthepalestinians\">occupation</a> of the West Bank is thrown into the mix. Under international law, not serving over the Green Line is actually a far more moral position for an Israeli to take than blindly following the herd and doing the IDF's bidding without a second thought. </p> <p>However, as usual, considerations of international law come a distant second to kneejerk, nationalistic posturing. As word of New Profile's activities spread, more and more people are jumping on the bandwagon of castigation, working themselves into a frenzy about the corrupting influence that the group supposedly exerts on the nation's youth. According to this view, anyone defying the order to serve should be branded with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_and_mark_of_Cain\">mark of Cain</a> and exposed as a dangerous revolutionary. </p> <p>Unless, of course, they are ultra-orthodox, in which case it's just business as usual, and no one dares speak out for fear of incurring the wrath of the omnipotent rabbinate. What's sauce for the haredi goose is not considered sauce for the conscientious gander, and the Israeli army, authorities and media seem more than content to play along in this duplicitous game.</p>",
  "<p>Well, it shouldn't be a surprise really. Back in December last year we at BBC Science set out to make a three-part series for BBC2 about global warming, one of the biggest controversies of our era (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00djvq9\">Earth: The Climate Wars</a>). And now we've ended up becoming a part of the controversy. Indeed, having made a point of highlighting how virulent the debate over human-induced climate change has become, I can now report on that from first hand experience. </p> <p>Most of the reaction has come from the blogosphere. Much of it has <a href=\"http://climateresearchnews.com/2008/09/bbc-bias-part-2-earththe-climate-wars-programme-3-a-viewers-view/\">been</a> <a href=\"http://www.climate-resistance.org/2008/09/biased-broadcasting-climate.html\">critical</a>, but some has been <a href=\"http://iainjclark.livejournal.com/191091.html\">supportive</a>. Some of it has even surfaced on more mainstream sites such as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/21/do2105.xml\">the Telegraph</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1063110/BBC-investigated-peer-says-climate-change-programme-biased-sided-polemic.html\">Daily Mail</a>.</p> <p>If there's one thing the reaction to the series makes clear, it is that there is still a furious debate going on out there. Some contributors to the series apparently feel they haven't been fairly represented in the finished films. This is something we take seriously. We can only make these programmes because people are prepared to give up their time for us, and to trust us to use their contributions fairly. Obviously, as programme makers, we have to make selections from interviews. It's our job to make sure that in editing an individual contribution, we don't edit the argument. Have we \u2013 taking the film as a whole \u2013 done justice to each contributor's position? I'm confident that we did, but I know that contributors who feel passionately about a subject sometimes do feel that their individual arguments deserved more space. </p> <p>Meanwhile, some critics have taken a much more ideological approach. For them, the BBC is the \"Biased Broadcasting Corporation\", incapable of \"balance\" on global warming (or indeed any other major issue). All I can say is that I wish the bloggers could have been there as we made the series. I think that had they been with us they would have been reassured at the level of scrutiny that all the scientific claims in the series were subjected to. And as some of the more thoughtful blogs have noticed, we were determined to give credit to the sceptical arguments where and when they were justified. In fact, to some scientists we gave them a bit too much credit. (The examples are more in emails we've received than on blogs.)</p> <p>Others come at us with a barrage of scientific arguments (although they all boil down to variations on a small number of points). Fair do's; it's a science series, after all. The debate continues online, and I don't propose to go through each argument here. But happily, there are some points which are easy to clarify. </p> <p>In his Telegraph article, Christopher Booker <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/09/21/do2105.xml\">suggests</a> that when we discussed the satellite temperature records we allowed contributor Dr Roy Spencer to admit that there had been an error, but didn't allow him to go on and say that once he corrected for this the results were the same. But in the film, Dr Spencer makes clear that his corrections did change the results. Here, for the avoidance of doubt, is the exact quote:</p> <blockquote> <p> I think when we made that correction I \u2013 if I'm remembering correctly \u2013 I think we went from a, a cooling trend to a slight warming trend and then ever since then it's been a warming trend, actually by sort of ever increasing amounts.</p> </blockquote> <p>In addition, Mr Booker says that we truncated a graph to reinforce a point attacking the Channel 4 documentary <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/science/microsites/G/great_global_warming_swindle/\">The Great Global Warming Swindle</a>. Actually we went back to the scientists whose work formed the basis of the original graph in the Channel 4 programme, and asked them for their latest published data. Which we then faithfully reproduced. </p> <p>And then there's the \"hockey stick\" \u2013 a graph that reconstructs the temperature of the last 1,000 years. It's claimed by some that the hockey stick has been discredited. So what did we say in the series? That the hockey stick was beyond reproach? Actually no. We acknowledged that the original hockey stick probably did underestimate the degree of variability in the climate before the last 100 years. But that since then many more temperature reconstructions have been done, all of which agree with the main point; the warming in the last 100 years is greater than anything experienced in the last 1,000 years. That conclusion was backed up two years ago in a report by the <a href=\"http://www.nationalacademies.org/\">American National Academy of Sciences</a>. </p> <p>Perhaps a clue to the weaknesses in Mr Booker's article comes from his methodology. <a href=\"http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=3649\">This posting</a> suggests that he went trawling for criticisms from fellow \"sceptics\". Perhaps he didn't check the answers he got back. </p> <p>Many of the criticisms of the series seem to have misunderstood exactly what it was trying to do. Maybe that's our fault for not being clearer. The series set out to tell the history of global warming; in other words, the history of a scientific idea. Our job was to tell the story of how global warming was \"discovered\", the scientific battles that were central to the climate change debate, and to explain how we got to where we are now. Which is where exactly?</p> <p>Today, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists would, I think, agree with three propositions. First, the climate is in a warming trend. Second, that most of this warming trend is down to human emissions of greenhouse gases. And third, that if emissions continue to rise then the result will be continued warming which will become damaging to human society. It's also true to say that \u2013 here in Britain \u2013 all the main political parties accept that global warming is real, and that it's a threat to society. In America, both candidates for the presidency take the same view. Most major corporations are also in the same camp. </p> <p>Given the above, it would have required a major rewriting of history to conclude the series by saying \u2013 as some of our critics would have liked \u2013 that global warming is a con (or even a plot), whipped up by wussy liberal scientists with a vested interest in perpetuating the \"myth\" of warming. No, I'm afraid the story of the series is much more mundane. We did our best to accurately reflect the debates of the last 40 years or so, and to tell them in an entertaining and thought provoking way. </p> <p>I guess we got the last bit right at least.</p>",

  "<p>A few weeks ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> burst into the popular consciousness like some kind of super Kylie and won the hearts of an entire hemisphere. Then, like a giant moth flying too close to the sun, poof! She self-destructed in a flaming tangle of gossamer wings, furry thorax and horrid leg bits. Just like Diana, Princess of Hearts. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP12aNzocSc\">Only more so. </a><br> The showbiz equivalent to this spectacular rise and fall would be running into the spotlight to rapturous applause, skidding on a banana skin and smacking into a steel column by side of the stage. Thus, Sarah Palin has become the perfect embodiment of the live fast, die young and leave a good-looking corpse rock'n'roll aesthetic. And, in doing so, she has made rock'n'roll redundant.  The pop tragedy that has been Sarah Palin's gloriously entertaining fortnight in the limelight will no doubt be compared by lesser scribes to the crash'n'burn trajectories of Buddy Holly or Mama Cass. They do the story a disservice. It took Jesus Christ 33 years to be born in a blaze of media hype, have an entire nation hanging on his every word, and then be crucified in front of a jeering mob. It took Sarah Palin just two incredible weeks, making her not only more rock'n'roll than Jesus, but more rock'n'roll than rock'n'roll itself.  It's like the evil capitalist Tyrell tells super sexy robot Rutger Hauer in Bladerunner: the light that burns twice as bright, burns for half as long - and Sarah Palin has burned so very, very brightly.  Rock'n'roll is dead, rendered redundant by the woman who allegedly called her son Van so that his name would rhyme with <a href=\"http://www.vhnd.com/2008/08/29/sarah-palin-loves-van-halen/\">Van Halen</a>. That's how rock'n'roll she is. And that's how totally un-rock'n'roll she is. Which is totally rock'n'roll. <br> But in the weeks between her triumphant Autocue reading at the Republican National Convention and her <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/music/2008/09/palin-compariso.html\">disastrously inept</a> metaphorical screwing of the proverbial pooch on <a href=\"http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/?inc=vid&amp;id=1314030\">CBS News</a>, Palin became, like the zombie, pan-metaphorical. <br> For starters, she has made the drawn out substance-assisted career suicides of Shame McGowan and Pete Doherty look overblown, and she's done it stone cold sober. Which makes her the str8-edge Amy Winehouse. Except that Winehouse has talent. </p> <p>No scrub that. Palin is like Oi. She's from the street, she don't have no truck with that fancy book-learning leftie rubbish. Nah, she's just having a larf. And hanging around with people who just happen to very, very right wing. </p> <p>Or maybe she's actually more like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55xTlD95eo\">Boney M</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9t8_YgqBl4\">Sham 69</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A-EOwci_Yc&amp;feature=related\">Boy George</a>, or any other pop act that's attempted to make a profound political statement and instead made a total dick of themselves. Like the Rolling Stones, for instance, who took part in the storming of the US Embassy in London by war protesters in 1968, wrote the chicken shit Street Fighting Man and then never left their mansions ever again. <a href=\"http://video.yahoo.com/watch/3557931/9843294\">Except to vote Lib Dem.</a> <br> Palin combines the DIY ethic of punk with the hamfisted amateurism of a Balkan Eurovision entry. But more than that, faced with a reasonably competent interviewer on live TV she resembles us all in that dream we share about playing guitar live onstage with U2. The one where Bono beckons you into the limelight. You throw an incredibly sexy shape that has millions of U2 fans screaming in appreciation. And then you crap yourself as you remember that <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/couric-palin-open/704042/\">you can't actually play a single note</a>. <br> Except Palin doesn't crap herself. She babbles on, like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMIKQ7-VbS8\">Joey from the episode of Friends</a> where he's convinced that if he makes French-sounding noises, he is in fact speaking French. She is, in short, <a href=\"http://www.jonthepostman.org.uk/introduction.shtml\">Jon the Postman</a>, the musically challenged postal worker who got onstage at early punk gigs in Manchester and yelled incoherently in the microphone, and thus became a DIY punk legend and harbinger of the post-Big Brother era where talent and celebrity became entirely divorced. <br> Sarah Palin is both the executioner and the living embodiment of rock'n'roll. She is its Jesus Christ and its rough beast, whose hour has come round at last, slouching towards Bethlehem to be born. And she is but one deranged electorate and a heart attack away from control of the greatest empire the world has ever known.  All hail the rocky mom.</p>",
