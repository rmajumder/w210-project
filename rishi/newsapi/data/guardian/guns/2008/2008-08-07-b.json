  "<p>I'm deep in conversation with George Pelecanos, speaking from his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, when I ask if he minds being labelled a crime writer. There's a pregnant pause. Dogs start barking, then howling. Have I asked the wrong question? </p> <p>He excuses himself, pacifies the pooches and moves to another room before answering. \"It's fine,\" he assures me with a deep southern drawl. But he adds a caveat: \"I'm not a mystery writer \u2013 that is a misnomer. The formula of the mystery novel is that a murder is committed in the first chapter then solved in the last chapter, and the world is set back upright again. That's meant to comfort the reader. I've even heard crime writers say that they're doing some kind of public service by making people feel good about the world. I just don't agree with that. When someone's murdered, it forever haunts the family and the community. It ripples out.\"</p> <p>The Turnaround shows how far those ripples can reach. Written in clean and direct prose, the book is split into two sections: the first set in the early 70s, the second in the present day. As a teenager, Alex Pappas is the passive participant in a violent, racially motivated incident. After a day's drinking, his friends drive into a black neighbourhood, volley racial abuse at a group of bystanders and then run into trouble when they hit a dead end. The day ends in death and the event haunts Pappas as an older man until a chance encounter offers a shot at redemption.</p> <p>The story spins off from an incident that occurred close to Pelecanos's home when he was young: \"I went back to that neighbourhood and talked to people about it. I got a transcript of the trial but everything's fictionalised beyond that.\" The author himself hit his teens in the early 70s and the book is cluttered with nostalgic details. Almost obsessive attention is paid to brands of sneakers, amplifiers and cars, as well as the sounds on the local radio stations. Pelecanos's books typically sing with musical references - presumably it won't be long before they are published with accompanying soundtrack CDs.</p> <p>Family is at the heart of many Pelecanos novels, embodied here by the coffee shop where Alex helps his father. Pelecanos himself grew up working at a lunch counter run by his dad: \"He was my hero. He had a heart attack and cancer in the same year, when I was 19 years old, and I dropped out of college to run the family business.\" A throwaway comment in the novel provides another link between Pappas and Pelecanos. Alex is a detective fiction fan and confides in another character: \"I thought I wanted to write a book, once. And I tried it, quietly.\" Did Pelecanos approach his first novel in a similar manner? \"Nobody knew except my wife,\" he laughs. \"I had a little card table set up in the back room of our house. I was bartending at night and working in the kitchen of a bar during the day. I'd get up very early and write in longhand in notebooks.\"</p> <p>That first book, A Firing Offence, introduced accidental PI Nick Stefanos, who interrupts his work as a bartender and electronics salesman (another of Pelecanos's early jobs) to find missing people. The book was followed by two more outings for Stefanos, all of which were put out in the UK by Serpent's Tail. Pelecanos is quick to name-check the publisher Pete Ayrton: \"Pete was the first guy who brought me out in paperback. American journalists started reading foreign press about me and it really did something for my career.\" There is frustration in his voice when he says, \"The New York Times didn't review any of my books until my seventh novel. And then I got one paragraph.\" Was it a favourable write-up? \"It was good,\" he admits. \"But it was still a paragraph.\"</p> <p>After the Stefanos trilogy came the DC Quartet, which used a sprawling cast to capture the changing face of the nation's capital across several decades. Then there were three modern-day novels starring black private investigator and ex-cop Derek Strange, who reappeared as a younger man in Hard Revolution (Pelecanos's personal favourite among his novels), set amid the 1968 riots following Martin Luther King's assassination. </p> <p>Characters from earlier books are inlined to make cameos in later work \u2013 one of Stefanos's buddies has a cameo in The Turnaround \u2013 but the author has so far resisted milking a long-running detective series. \"There's always a dissipation of quality in the repetition,\" he says. \"The authors get tired of it themselves. I think Rankin got Rebus out at the right time.\"</p> <p>Detectives and PIs are notably absent in The Turnaround, the latest in a line of standalones Pelecanos has written since he became involved with the HBO series The Wire. He says working on the show in Baltimore made him eager to find \"new ways to talk about the social issues I'm interested in but still within the context of a crime novel\". Take Drama City, the first to be written during his stint on the programme: \"It's kind of an odd book,\" he admits. \"It's about a dog catcher. It's not really a traditional crime novel. None of them have been since The Wire.\" </p> <p>There's a direct line from Pelecanos's examinations of DC's race relations, political machinations and the drug trade in his early novels through to The Wire, which he lent the same eye for detail and ear for dialogue. The acclaimed show presented a sobering state-of-the-nation portrait, but during our conversation Pelecanos repeatedly declares his hope for America's future. The Turnaround uses an unabashed metaphor of national healing: one of the characters works as a physical therapist at the Walter Reed army medical centre. \"I live just a mile from there so I often see soldiers on the street with missing limbs. I wanted to talk to them, and I reported on what I saw and heard. They were trying to move on with their lives.\"</p> <p>The Turnaround escalates towards the author's customary violent final showdown but Pelecanos is tired of hearing about the \"dark and gritty world\" of his novels. \"It's an optimistic book,\" he insists. \"When I wrote The Turnaround, I had no idea that Obama was going to rise up. Maybe in my subconscious I was onto something. We are probably going to have a black president. Because of the baggage that my generation has, I'm going to look at Obama and say 'That's our first black president.' Kids are going to look at him and say, 'That's our president.' Once you cross that line, you don't go backwards, man. I see an awful lot of good happening right now. I called the book The Turnaround because we \u2013 not just the characters in the book \u2013 are trying to right the ship.\"</p> <p>I wonder if Pelecanos harbours political ambitions like his fellow crime writer Kinky Friedman, who ran for governor of Texas. A hearty laugh comes down the line. \"Absolutely not. I love what I'm doing.\" Right now, his focus is on the next novel \u2013 a tale about juvenile delinquents \u2013 which means writing seven days a week until the book is done. \"My dad loved to go to work,\" he remembers. \"He was never happier than when he was behind the lunch counter. I do the same thing. I'm turning the key on my business every day just like my dad did.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Britain makes spouses promise to learn </h2> <p>The British government has shelved plans to force spouses to learn English before they join their partners in Britain. </p> <p>Instead, spouses will be required to sign up to an agreement to learn the language before they leave their home country with checks made on their progress \"soon after arrival\".</p> <p>If spouses were found not to be fulfilling their promise to learn they could have their visas revoked, the Home Office said in an announcement last month.</p> <p>The climbdown by ministers comes after a public consultation exercise overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to require spouses to learn basic English before they were given visas to join husbands or wives.</p> <p>Immigration minister Liam Byrne said the introduction of English tests before spouses moved to the UK would be a \"medium-term goal\". </p> <p>But he claimed it would be impractical to demand tests before arrival because English lessons are not widely enough available overseas. </p> <p>Byrne said: \"British citizens have the right to marry whoever they choose. But we want newcomers to succeed in our society and sign up to the standards we have in common. That means freedom, not being forced to marry someone, and it means newcomers quickly acquiring a command of English, with consequences for those who break the rules.\"</p> <h2>Appeal against Poland's U-turn on English for all</h2> <p>Polish intellectuals, politicians, artists and celebrities have put their names to an open letter appealing to their prime minister, Donald Tusk, to reinstate a policy to teach English from the first year of primary school.</p> <p>The letter was prompted by the government's surprise decision to go back on its plan to introduce English language teaching in all schools from September.</p> <p>One of the signatories, Polish MEP Konrad Szymanski, told Polskie Radio: \"Compulsory English education in elementary schools is the best way to popularise this language. If Poland wants to be involved in the mainstream, common knowledge of English is a basic factor.\"</p> <p>The radio station quoted former president Lech Walesa as saying: \"I had no chance to learn English and I still feel hampered by it.\"</p> <p>Instead of making English compulsory, the education ministry now wants schools to choose which modern languages to teach.</p> <p>The ministry argues that in some regions of the country Russian or German would be more useful than English.</p> <h2>Crowded classes curb Saudi scholarships</h2> <p>Saudi Arabia is reported to be suspending scholarships for its students to study at foreign universities because too many of them are enrolled together in English language preparation classes, raising concerns about the quality of their training.</p> <p>The Saudi ministry of education limits the number of its scholarship students allowed to enrol at a single institution to 1% of the total student body. According to the Australian newspaper, 31 universities worldwide have now exceeded that limit, including five in Australia.</p> <p>Australia's allocation of Saudi scholarship students for 2008 was set at 1,100, but 1,700 students have been enrolled. In 2007 there were 2,299 Saudi students in English preparation programmes, an increase of 120% on 2006.</p> <h2>Japan's Nova boss faces charges over unpaid wages</h2> <p>Prosecutors in Osaka, Japan, received formal charges last month against failed English language school operator Nova Corp and its former president, Nozomu Sahashi, on suspicion of violating labour standards laws for failing to pay wages to Nova workers. </p> <p>Sahashi is suspected of failing to pay $1m in wages to 400 Nova workers. Among them were 266 foreign instructors whose unpaid wages in October last year totalled $673,000.</p> <p>Sahashi has claimed his failure to pay wages was not a violation of the law. \"I feel responsible as the [former] president of the company, but I did what I could do, like putting my own money into the business,\" he told labour officials.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><a href=\"mailto:max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com\">max.delotbiniere@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>David Pearce's film Footprints means so much to him that it is almost painful to listen to his story. You desperately want it to succeed, so that he can recoup his \u00a3200,000 investment in the film and feel vindicated for the three years he has spent working on it.</p> <p>Pearce, now 65, is a veteran cameraman. Obsessed by film as a child growing up in Essex, he got a job in documentaries at the age of 16, was a clapper loader on David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia in the early 1960s, joined Path\u00e9 News, hung out with the Beatles, filmed the 1966 World Cup, shot commercials and a few features, and then - married and with two small children - opted for the more controllable life of television, working mainly for Anglia.</p> <p>His professional life ran smoothly until 1998, when he was attacked at his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, by a burglar. Pearce was knifed and left for dead. After that, his world fell apart. He had always been fond of a drink; now he tipped over into alcoholism. His wife left him; he couldn't work; he quit Anglia TV. He divorced, sold his house, and went to live in St Ives, Cornwall, which he had loved since he first visited the town with his parents when he was seven.</p> <p>In St Ives he signed up with a doctor who was determined to get him off the booze. It's not clear where the idea of making a film came from - Pearce is resistant to the suggestion that it was mainly a form of therapy - but in 2003 he remortgaged his cottage, bought a state-of-the-art camera for \u00a350,000 and started shooting in and around St Ives, capturing its gorgeous sands, unforgiving seas, pesky seagulls (there is a scene in his film straight out of Hitchcock's The Birds) and holiday-makers. </p> <p>Pearce spent the next three years developing a portrait of a town still animated by local customs. He calls Footprints, the name of his 72-minute love letter to his adopted home, a \"time capsule\". \"Nothing like it will ever be made again,\" he says. \"I wanted to capture the beauty of St Ives and show my respect for it.\" To explain, too, what had captivated generations of artists.</p> <p>It does have some beautiful scenes, a haunting score by David Mitcham and a percussive climax that captures the oddity of some of the people drawn to Cornwall. But you can understand why TV companies and cinemas have so far been resistant. What is it? A nature film, a gentle documentary about a town, a photographic record of one man's quest for spiritual renewal? Art for whose sake?</p> <p>Pearce says producing the film has left him \"penniless\", but he doesn't seem unduly bothered. \"I've got no regrets about making it,\" he says. \"I've got the most beautiful film on the planet. That's what life's about. Something will crop up, and it will be OK.\" A publisher based in Somerset is interested in marketing a DVD. Failing that, Pearce can always sell the camera.</p> <p>But he doesn't want to. He wants to use it to shoot a film about alcoholism and the dangers drink poses to the young - he says he has been battling the demons on and off since the late 1950s. He even has a working title: Fear of Fear. </p> <p>\"What I went through was absolute hell,\" he says. \"It was terrifying having this [drink problem], and I'd like to make a film showing people, especially young people, what I went through. </p> <p>But I'd show Footprints immediately afterwards, to demonstrate what you can achieve if you beat it.\"</p> <p>Footprints is available from <a href=\"http://www.footprints-thefilm.co.uk/\">footprints-thefilm.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Here is the biggest, fattest, dampest squib of the week: perhaps the most disappointing film ever to have won the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival. Brazilian director Jos\u00e9 Padilha made the documentary Bus 174, about a man who stormed aboard a city bus in Rio in 2000 and held the passengers to ransom at gunpoint on live TV. His fiction feature, based on the memoirs of a cop in the city's paramilitary elite squad, tells the story of how these hardcore officers were horrified to discover in the 1990s that Pope John Paul II on his upcoming visit wished to stay near the favelas and that they were therefore required to storm these no-go areas to clean them up. There's an awful lot of very cliched Brazilian slum-porn, gun-porn and poverty-porn, all knocked off from the influential favela masterpiece City of God. The movie's evasive cynicism, morphing gradually and insidiously into lipsmacking adoration of the macho lawmen in their SS-style black uniforms, is pathetic. The worst moment comes when the anti-hero Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) jeers at a feeble cop applying to join their ranks: \"You belong with the whores, you belong with the pimps, you belong with the abortion clinics.\" Um, excuse me? Abortion clinics? Getting a reactionary sermon from a pumped-up man in uniform is the last thing we need.</p>",
  "<p>No British composer since Benjamin Britten has announced himself so decisively as George Benjamin did in 1980 with his first orchestral work. Benjamin composed Ringed By the Flat Horizon when he was 19 and a first-year undergraduate at Cambridge. Almost 30 years later, it still seems a wondrous achievement, with the formal confidence, understanding of instrumental colour and texture, and lucid harmonic sense that have characterised his music ever since.</p> <p>Benjamin included the piece in his Prom with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Carefully unwrapping the instrumental layers and shaping the lyrical details, the performance perfectly conveyed the sense of tense expectation that pervades the work, which takes its title from a line by Eliot but depicts a landscape over which a thunderstorm is about to break. It is a piece in which the journey matters far more than the arrival, but Benjamin judged both perfectly.</p> <p>The BBCSO went on to give a gentle, fond account of Ravel's Pavane pour une Infante D\u00e9funte, which led directly into his Bol\u00e9ro. Benjamin made that a tingling affair through sheer restraint, savouring the kaleidoscope of instrumental colour and holding everything in check until the final onslaught could be resisted no longer.</p> <p>The first half of the programme had been much less convincing, however. Benjamin had opened with his teacher Olivier Messiaen's first large-scale orchestral work, L'Ascension, and found his attempts to unfold it undermined by some under-par brass playing, with hardly a single attack in the opening movement exactly co-ordinated. Stravinsky's Violin Concerto seemed a bit approximate, too. Carlin Widmann's account of the solo part was edgy and neat, and Benjamin accompanied crisply, but some of the orchestral edges were still distinctly foxed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Repeated on Radio 3 on Monday.</p>",

Photograph: Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the publication of her novel The Well of Loneliness in 1928, the writer Radclyffe Hall, a lesbian from an upper-class family in Bournemouth, warned her editor that the book would require a mammoth commitment from its publisher. \"I have put my pen at the service of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world,\" she announced portentously. </p> <p>\"So far as I know nothing of the kind has ever been attempted before in fiction.\" </p> <p>Hall's novel chronicles the life of Stephen Gordon, an English woman from an upper-class family, whose \"sexual inversion\" (as the likes of sexologist Havelock Ellis described homosexuality at that time) is apparent from an early age. It thus became the first novel ever to openly address lesbianism. Gordon falls for Mary Llewellyn, a woman she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in the first world war, but the couple's happiness is ruined by their social rejection. A silent plea of \"allow us the right to our existence\" runs throughout the narrative, as the characters descend into despair, relieved only by copious amounts of cocaine and creme de menthe.</p> <p>By modern standards the book is chaste; the only reference to lesbian sex is the line \" ... and that night they were not divided\". But by portraying lesbianism as being as \"natural\" as heterosexuality, The Well of Loneliness was radical. Its publication provoked a major outcry, leading to an obscenity trial that concluded with the book's ban and an order that all </p> <p>copies should be pulped because it defended \"unnatural practices between women\". Public feeling was so strong that the editor of the Sunday Express, James Douglas, wrote that he \"would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel\".</p> <p>Hall's book continued to be supported by well-known intellectuals such as Virginia Woolf and EM Forster, and was published in France and the US, where it sold steadily for decades. By 1943 it had been translated into 14 languages, but it remained banned in Britain until 1949, six years after Hall's death.</p> <p>Today there is still much debate about The Well of Loneliness, which has been reissued for its 80th anniversary. While it has often been criticised for its gloomy outlook on homosexual life, and Jeanette Winterson refers to it as an \"awful book\", others see it as a literary classic. The writer Lee Lynch believes that no novel since \"has been as great. It is beautifully written and constructed, with delightful prose. It is the standard-bearer; the lesbian The Grapes of Wrath.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the novel remains a staple on the bookshelves of many a lesbian, and it has often been argued that it actively paved the way for the development of the lesbian novel - first in its pulp incarnation, then as a gritty counter-cultural genre, and latterly as a well-established and lucrative part of mainstream publishing. According to the crime writer Val McDermid, there are two distinct groupings within the broad category of \"lesbian fiction\". One is lesbian genre fiction - such as romance, mystery and science fiction, written by lesbians with predominantly lesbian characters and a gay female audience specifically in mind. Then there are books written by lesbians who depict a wider world and shine a critical light on it. These novels generally have lesbian characters, but they exist as part of a broader landscape, and the books have proved appealing to a huge range of readers. In fact, lesbian novels are now so accepted, successful and even respectable that their relevance to the lesbian community sometimes seems to have dimmed. At a time when lesbian characters are accepted with barely a blush by mainstream readers, do gay women really have any need of these literary role models?</p> <p>Back in the 1950s, when lesbian pulp fiction first became popular, there is no doubt how important these characters were. Although the pulp novels were routinely shot through with negativity - lesbians being portrayed as mad, mannish neurotics - the books did, at the very least, validate the existence of an alternative sexuality for women. They featured lesbians in institutions, love triangles and being \"saved\" by straight men. Despite the fact that the protagonists rarely fared well, and the books had titles such as Women's Barracks and The Evil Friendship, they appealed to an entire generation of lesbian readers. The \"rule\" of pulp fiction was that characters could indulge in wild affairs with other women, but they then had to experience a downfall. That way, lesbian stories could be published, while still appearing to condemn unnatural practices.</p> <p>A classic of the genre, albeit one with a happy ending, was Ann Bannon's Beebo Brinker. Brinker is a butch 17-year-old, fresh from a farm in her Wisconsin home town, who is banished by her family for wearing her brother's clothes in public. Arriving in Greenwich Village, she is soon befriended by a lonely gay man who teaches her the ropes of gay life. Together they explore the underground Village bars, where she finds the \"love that smoulders in the shadows of the twilight world\". The story ends with Brinker finding true love. </p> <p>Another exception to the unhappy ending-rule was The Price of Salt by Patricia Highsmith, published in 1952 and written under the pseudonym Claire Morgan. The plot centres around the love affair between Therese, who works in a department store, and Carol, one of her customers. The relationship leads to Carol losing custody of her daughter, but the book's ending is optimistic, hinting that the women may stay together and find happiness. </p> <p>The first contemporary novelist to come out as a lesbian was Maureen Duffy, author of the 1966 classic The Microcosm, which focuses on the community found within lesbian bars. Then as the gay and lesbian liberation movements gathered pace in the UK and US in the early 70s, the genre began to change for the better.</p> <p>The American novelist Rita Mae Brown, who lived with tennis star Martina Navratilova in the late 70s, wrote the classic coming-out story Rubyfruit Jungle, published in 1973. This novel had a significant influence on lesbian literature. It swept away the figure of the closeted, lonely lesbian, replacing her with an out-and-proud character who pursued sex with lusty abandon, and believed that lesbianism was a positive choice rather than a condition of birth. </p> <p>However, despite the changes for the better, few mainstream publishing companies wanted to publish lesbian fiction, which led to the emergence of a number of independent, lesbian-run publishing houses, such as Amazon and Naiad Press.</p> <p>My favourite Naiad Press novel was Swashbuckler, written by Lynch and published in 1985. It is set in the 50s and 60s and follows 15 years in the life of New Yorker and butch dyke, Frenchy Tonneau. Where some lesbian authors tend to revert to stereotypical characters, Lynch's Frenchy is a lovable rascal. Her struggle to find acceptance in the context of gross homophobia is moving and funny, and paints a clear picture of how brave gay people had to be if they dared to come out in that era.</p> <p>By the 80s, many lesbian novels were picking up the popular themes of gay male literature, including descriptions of sado-masochism and other forms of sexual experimentation. There were also books that explored political issues such as racism and sexual violence. Say Jesus and Come to Me (1982), for instance, was written by one of the few African-American lesbian novelists of the time, Ann Allen Shockley. Her protagonist, Myrtle Black, is a closeted lesbian and evangelist who preaches sermons about the ills of discrimination. Hearing about the shooting of two young prostitutes, Black forms a coalition of women to challenge the racist, sexist sensibilities in her community. Although the book deals with serious issues, it features some hilarious and risque scenes. During one church service, for instance, Black gyrates wildly against a young, female member of her congregation while the oblivious gospel singers belt out their love for Jesus.</p> <p>Then came the trend for lesbian detective and romance novels. In the 1980s, McDermid made her bones writing lesbian private detective novels, before moving into the mainstream, and turning to the serial-killer genre. In recent decades other lesbian writers, such as Ali Smith, Stella Duffy and Jackie Kay, have had huge success, and many readers probably don't give much thought to the sexuality of these writers. \"These women are writing some of the best contemporary fiction,\" says McDermid, \"and the fact that they are not ghettoised speaks to a general loosening up of British society.\"</p> <p>One of Britain's most loved lesbian writers, Sarah Waters, author of the acclaimed Tipping the Velvet, believes that, today, so-called \"lesbian fiction\" appeals to a wide spectrum of people, but that \"what gives it a common identity is the extra political and emotional charge it has for its core audience, who still struggle to see honest and fair representations of their lives in mainstream culture. As long as this charge continues to exist, the 'lesbian' label will remain important\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall is published by Virago Press Ltd.

  "<p>Utter the name Joyce McKinney to Britons of a certain age, and you are inevitably rewarded with the briefest flash of incomprehension, followed by a gasp as their memories take them tumbling back to the dark days of early autumn, 1977.</p> <p>It was a miserable time: there were clashes on the picket line at Grunwick, inflation was sprinting away at 13%, Elvis had just died and a band called Baccara were at Number One with Yes Sir, I Can Boogie. And then, as if to lift the spirits of a nation, along came the most unlikely, the most baffling, the most downright weird news story.</p> <p>A Mormon missionary from Utah called Kirk Anderson, who was going door-to-door in Ewell, Surrey, was kidnapped at gunpoint by McKinney, a former cheerleader and beauty queen from North Carolina. With the help of a friend, Keith May, McKinney drugged Anderson with chloroform and drove him to a rented 17th century cottage near Okehampton, Devon. There the unfortunate young man was chained, spreadeagled, to a bed, with several pairs of mink-lined handcuffs, and over the next few days he was repeatedly required to have sex with McKinney, who later explained that she had been keen to bear his child.</p> <p>Eventually the missionary wriggled free, dashed from the cottage and alerted police, who set up roadblocks around Okehampton, capturing both beauty queen and friend. The pair were charged with false imprisonment and possession of an imitation .38 revolver, and brought before Epsom magistrates. </p> <p>McKinney explained at the commital proceedings that she had fallen head over heels for Anderson when they were at college together in Utah, adding: \"I loved him so much that I would ski naked down Mount Everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to.\" She had hired a private detective, tracked Anderson down and came to Britain with May.</p> <h2>Tabloid dream</h2> <p>It was a tabloid dream. Mormon Sex Slave Case, screeched the Daily Mail. McKinney and the Manacled Mormon, yelled the Mirror. Even the Guardian got in on the act with the only-slightly more coy: Missionary was \"shackled for sex\". McKinney's counsel told the magistrates that \"methinks the Mormon do protest too much\".</p> <p>McKinney was remanded in custody at Holloway prison, north London, pending the full trial but released on bail three months later because of her failing mental health. May was also bailed and at this point they fled to Canada disguised asmime artists.</p> <p>And that, perhaps, should have been the end of the matter.</p> <p>But then last Tuesday, courtesy of the Associated Press news agency, came the delightful story of one \"Bernann\" McKinney, whose pet dog Booger the pit bull terrier had been successfully cloned by a team of South Korean scientists. </p> <p>Announcing that she planned to give her identical pets the names Booger McKinney, Booger Lee, Booger Ra, Booger Hong and Booger Park, in honour of the team at Seoul National University that carried out the work, a delighted McKinney could be seen beaming from several news websites and newspapers, including the Guardian. And some of a certain age beamed back, thinking: \"Ohmygawd!\"</p> <p>A simple check of public records in North Carolina yesterday confirmed that Joyce and \"Bernann\" are, indeed, one and the same person, and that the predatory beauty queen of 1977 has matured into the pit bull-loving 57-year-old of 2008.</p> <p>The years have not been particularly kind to McKinney. She has put on a little weight (haven't we all?) and has used a wheelchair for more than a decade. After crossing the border from Canada she travelled to Atlanta, Georgia, where she went into hiding, disguised as a nun, according to some accounts. Then she returned to the tiny town of Minneapolis on the North Carolina-Tennessee border, where her parents had been schoolteachers, and moved on to her late grandparents' wooden farmhouse.</p> <p>There were to be a few more scrapes with the law. In 1984 she was arrested after Anderson spotted her loitering near his place of work in Salt Lake City. When the police searched the boot of her car they found a length of rope and a pair of handcuffs, but charges against her were dropped after she once again jumped bail.</p> <p>In 1993 she broke into a dog pound in Johnson City, Tennessee, to rescue a pit bull terrier that was about to be put down for mauling a couple of joggers. This raises the possibility that the Booger brothers, so skillfully cloned in Seoul, are exact replicas of a dog that once faced the death penalty because of its attacks on humans. But, as McKinney explained after the break-in: \"I love those pit bulls. They're such sympathetic animals - they're my kind of dog.\"</p> <h2>Lawless</h2> <p>Minneapolis is in the heart of the southern Appalachians, the tough and somewhat lawless mountainous region that was the setting for the Burt Reynolds film Deliverance. Even here, however, some men say they are wary of her, and caution visitors not to stray on to her land, warning that they could be attacked by her pit bulls.</p> <p>Anderson himself married after returning to Utah, and found work as a travel agent in the small town of Orem.</p> <p>And by and large, McKinney has also led a blameless life over the past three decades. She could not be contacted for comment yesterday, but when a British reporter tracked her down and spoke to her nine years ago she said: \"Now everybody understands, and they know what it means to have the paparazzi chasing around after you. I cried all night when Diana died. I may be just an ol' farm girl, but I've hit that wall with her. Everywhere I go, people will always remember me as a woman who did the unthinkable. Just try to imagine what that feels like.\"</p> <p>In theory, however, McKinney remains a fugitive from British justice, and after breaking her cover to hail the success of the scientists in Soeul, could face extradition to stand trial back at Epsom. </p> <p>Is this possible? We asked Scotland Yard. The young woman - clearly too young - who answered the call, listened patiently for a few minutes. \"I'm sorry,\" she said finally. \"I haven't a clue what you're talking about.\"</p>",
  "<p>Four current and former British Airways executives face up to five years in jail after being charged with price-fixing offences yesterday, paving the way for the UK's most high-profile cartel trial. </p> <p>The case will be the biggest criminal prosecution yet under the 2002 Enterprise Act and will bring further embarrassment for BA and Virgin Atlantic, who have admitted colluding over setting fuel surcharges on flights.</p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said yesterday that BA's head of sales, Andrew Crawley, former marketing director Martin George, ex-communications head Iain Burns and Alan Burnett, who once ran UK and Ireland sales for the airline, have been charged with price fixing. BA was fined \u00a3271.5m by the OFT and US authorities last year after it admitted cartel offences on passenger and cargo flights. </p> <p>The men have been charged with \"having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the United Kingdom of passenger air transport services by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways\". They are due to appear at City of London magistrates court on September 24.</p> <p>The men are unlikely to be extradited to the US, where a criminal investigation is under way; anyone acquitted or convicted of price-fixing in the UK cannot be charged with the same offence across the Atlantic under double jeopardy rules. Six other former BA employees are understood to remain under investigation by the US Department of Justice.</p> <p>BA's reputation was dented when the scandal emerged, but the case is also expected to lay bare Virgin Atlantic's involvement. The airline founded by Sir Richard Branson escaped prosecution because it blew the whistle on its collusion with BA. But two former Virgin Atlantic executives - one-time commercial chief, Willy Boulter, and ex-communications boss Paul Moore - have been named in a class action lawsuit related to the case. </p> <p>Following talks with class action lawyers, both airlines have set up a \u00a3100m compensation fund for passengers caught out by the collusion between August 2004 and January 2006. BA and Virgin admitted conspiring to fix fuel surcharges. </p> <p>BA and Virgin Atlantic declined to comment, but Burns, who has since moved to Dubai where he works for the Etihad airline, released a statement through his lawyers saying he intended to clear his name. \"At the time of these events Iain Burns was the head of PR at British Airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions. Given his very high level of cooperation to the OFT, Iain is naturally disappointed with their decision. However, he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name.\" </p> <p>George also declared his intention to fight the charges. Burns and George left BA in October 2006 after the scandal broke. Price-fixing carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail under UK law.</p>",
  "<p>There is no better example of a credit crunch bargain hunter than Texas Pacific Group. One of the world's largest private equity firms, it has spent much of this year scouring the US and Europe looking for damaged banks to buy on the cheap. </p> <p>If anyone was looking for a winner from the financial mayhem created by the sub-prime crisis in the US and over-indebtedness in the UK, they need look no further than the brash and confident TPG.</p> <p>In April it pounced on Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loans business in the US. WaMu, as it is known, was one of the biggest victims of the debacle over dodgy home loans to sub-prime borrowers with poor credit histories. TPG's billionaire boss, David Bonderman, organised a \u00a33.5bn rescue with \u00a31bn of his own funds. Yet despite the bravado, the deal, and TPG's subsequent attempt to grab a large slice of Bradford &amp; Bingley in June, reveals the current, guarded nature of private equity. </p> <p>The \u00a33.5bn injection of equity into WaMu bought only a minority holding in the lender and gained Bonderman one seat on the board. </p> <p>In the heady days of 2006, TPG would typically take complete control of its prey. At Bradford &amp; Bingley, TPG backed away from overall control in favour of a 20% stake, before pulling out altogether. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why private equity has scaled back its ambitions. </p> <p>Washington Mutual shares were trading at $11 at the time of the rescue. By June, when analysts were arguing it would need to set aside \u00a315bn to cover losses on its mortgage book, the stock had declined to little more than $5. It is not known if TPG regrets its WaMu buy-in. Bonderman, like most private equity executives, makes few public appearances and rarely talks to the press.</p> <p>The latest figures from the Centre for Management Buy-out and Private Equity Research at Nottingham University show how far the industry has withdrawn from the corporate scene. Deals in the \u00a3100m-\u00a3500m range dropped to \u00a33bn in the first half of 2008, compared with \u00a37bn in the same period in 2007, according to the study. The total market between January and June was \u00a311bn, the lowest it has been since 2004.</p> <p>Mark Pacitti, corporate finance partner at Deloitte, which sponsors the centre, said deals large and small were off the agenda. \"The latest figures show private equity is feeling the credit crunch much more comprehensively and has hit a four-year low overall.\" </p> <p>It is not surprising that the large debt-fuelled private equity purchases, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' \u00a311bn buyout of chemist chain Alliance Boots, have foundered. Banks, which provided loans to fund buyouts, are nursing their own sub-prime losses and are no longer in the game.</p> <p>One executive said the ratio of debt to equity in private equity deals has almost reversed. A \u00a32.5bn buyout would typically involve \u00a32bn of debt and \u00a3500m of equity. Banks put up the debt and investors from pension funds to sovereign wealth funds put up the equity.</p> <p>Now the debt would be more like \u00a31bn with \u00a31.5bn of equity. \"But in truth those deals are not being done,\" he said. \"There is no market for buying and we can't sell for a good price. So we are focused on managing our portfolio of companies.\"</p> <p>Some debt is available, especially from the mid-sized mainland European banks that kept their fingers out of the sub-prime pie. Larger banks, such as Deutsche, Citi and UBS, are also still providing loans, but with limited funds, mid-tier buyouts tend to involve 10 banks when a year ago only three would be involved.</p> <p>Deals have also tended to focus on recession-proof businesses. Firms such as Apax Partners and Barclays Private Equity have looked to sectors such as healthcare to provide steady returns.</p> <p>Tom Lamb, joint head of the latter, said: \"The types of deals that have made it past the finishing line in the last few months have tended to be defensive plays. Deals such as Biffa at \u00a31.2bn, in the waste sector, and Abbot at \u00a30.9bn, an energy business, are good examples of the type of deals getting done. By contrast, the total value of retail deals has fallen dramatically.\"</p> <p>Deals such as these, where public companies are being taken private, are still the most common. The difference this year is the number of deals and their structure.</p> <p>Control is a key issue for private equity firms. Partnerships between buyout firms can muddy or even undermine a clear message to managers from the new owners. Yet the economic climate and restriction on funds have meant more such deals. For instance, the \u00a31bn acquisition of Emap's magazine arm was a joint venture between Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian, and Apax on a 50:50 split.</p> <p>\"Much of the time you spend on these deals is working out an agreement on how the business will be managed and where you want it to go. It may be that three firms partner to take a listed company private, but one firm will take the lead and drive through the agreed agenda,\" said an executive who asked to remain anonymous.</p> <p>Hangovers from last year play on the minds of the industry's senior figures. The buyout of music publisher EMI by Terra Firma may eventually prove profitable for Guy Hands' private equity vehicle. But his struggles to turn round the beleaguered business are a lesson in sticking to your knitting.</p> <p>Hands made his most recent fortune in recycling and waste management. He spotted growth industries that enjoyed long supply contracts and huge government subsidies. Why leap out of this secure sector in favour a record company - a flaky band of hippies and emo fans brutally exposed to a collapse in consumer demand and technological innovations?</p> <p>Hands is unrepentant. He continues to appoint new directors and tells his investors the deal will come good.</p> <p>The difficulties are likely to prove a deterrent to further deals this year. Another will be the popular view that a recession is looming and the value of corporate Britain is likely to sink.</p> <p>\"Why buy now when the price will be much cheaper next year?\" said the anonymous executive. \"If you've been around a long time you know that in periods like this funds are invested more slowly and reap greater returns.\" He said buyouts over the next couple of years would be turned around and sold back to the stockmarket at large premiums.</p> <p>However, unions continue to be wary of their tactics and will no doubt voice their concerns should the industry, as predicted, come roaring back next year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 8 2008. We mentioned the '\u00a32bn acquisition' of Emap by GMG/Apax, when the figure was in fact \u00a31bn. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>A documentary on one of the great taboos which manages to be unsensational and thought-provoking. The title refers to zoophiles or, as a voiceover puts it, \"someone who feels they have a closer affinity to animals than their own kind\". </p> <p>Co-writer and director Robinson Devor's film keeps things vague for a while with music that's alternately soothing and full of foreboding, but it's soon clear we're not talking about stroking a pet here. The definition comes in later: the film results from a specific case, the 2005 death of a zoophile after sex with a stallion, which brought a law against bestiality to Washington. </p> <p>Devor's film, co-written by journalist Charles Mudede, neither advocates nor condemns, but puts together a strange blend of reportage and testimony from both zoophiles and police with some skill.</p>",
  "<p>Toyota's powerful surge to the top of the global automotive industry rankings received a check yesterday when the car maker said net income in the three months to the end of June had tumbled 28%. </p> <p>The Japanese group, which has been running neck-and-neck all year with General Motors in the battle to become the world's biggest car maker, blamed a strengthening yen, rising raw material costs and sluggish markets in the US and western Europe.</p> <p>\"The financial results for this quarter were severe, due to our rapidly changing business environment,\" said Mitsuo Kinoshita, Toyota Motor Corporation's executive vice-president. </p> <p>Overall Toyota reported a 24,000 increase in the number of vehicles sold, to 2.19m. Net income fell to \u00a5353.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) from a record \u00a5491.5 bn in the same period last year. In North America, Toyota said sales in the quarter had fallen by 33,000 to 729,000. Toyota said it lifted its market share to 17.4%, but admitted it had been hurt by the market slowdown, a shift from higher value trucks to lower margin compact cars, higher bad debts and an increase in sales incentives.</p> <p>Toyota said it would \"take swift action in accordance with market changes by increasing the supply of models in high demand and launching new models\".</p> <p>Toyota reported higher sales in Japan, Australia and the Middle East as well as Russia and eastern Europe, but was affected by the slowdown in western Europe.</p> <p>The company said that it expected sales for its fiscal year, which runs to the end of March 2009, would be 8.7m vehicles. </p> <p>In a further sign of the pressure facing motor manufacturers, General Motors has asked its advertising agencies to share in its pain by cutting their fees for campaigns to lure car buyers into showrooms.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that GM has demanded price cuts of a fifth which would yield savings of more than $20m (\u00a310.2m) but could mean job losses at agencies such as McCann Erickson and Campbell-Ewald.</p> <p>A GM spokeswoman declined to comment on the size of the requested reductions but said: \"We have asked our advertising partners to work with us to eliminate low value work and to find creative solutions to go to market more efficiently.\"</p> <p>GM promotes brands such as Cadillac, Chevrolet and Hummer through advertising campaigns. The Detroit-based carmaker lost $15.5bn in the second quarter and its shares are trading at rock-bottom prices last seen in the 1950s. On Tuesday, the carmaker's board felt obliged to issue a statement affirming its confidence in its chief executive, Rick Wagoner.</p> <p>On a brighter note, BMW posted a 2.2% rise in group sales last month, helped by strong demand for the 1-Series coupe and cabrio as well as the full-size X5 and X6 offroaders. Sales of BMW's British made Mini rose 2.1% in July and are more than 15% up on the year to date. The Rolls-Royce division also reported strong growth, with more than 102 Phantoms being delivered in July, up by a fifth on the same month in 2007. In the first seven months of the year, overall deliveries of BMW marques rose by 4.4% to 890,699 vehicles.</p>",
  "<p>The sweat runs along Bradley Wiggins's back in thick rivulets and splashes on the wooden floor beneath his stationary bike. Close by him a middle-aged Chinese woman with a mop is hovering, ready to clear up the puddles that are gathering under the rider as he spins the pedals, holding his aerodynamic tuck but going nowhere, his rear wheel turning on a roller set up in the middle of the Laoshan velodrome. The bike shudders and the puddle spreads as he pounds on and on, observed from a distance by a gaggle of coaches. Welcome to the medals factory.</p> <p>With barely 24 hours to go before the opening ceremony of the 29th Olympic Games, the biggest in history, the newly shorn Wiggins and a dozen other members of the track cycling team - Victoria Pendleton, Chris Hoy, Rebecca Romero and the rest - are running through a micro-managed two-hour training session in the hall on Beijing's western outskirts where they will attempt to bring four years of preparation to a triumphant climax. Of Britain's 312-strong team, this squad is the one in which the greatest optimism is invested. All they need to do is maintain the momentum that brought nine gold medals at the world championships in Manchester last March for their exploits to provide a template of organisation and motivation to be followed by the rest of British sport in the long run-up to London 2012.</p> <p>But the events in the velodrome are still a week away. Before then the road cyclist Nicole Cooke, the shooter Richard Faulds, the gymnast Beth Tweddle and the 14-year-old diver Tom Daley - already so famous that he was signing autographs for Chinese fans watching training yesterday - are among those with the chance to get the team off to a medal-winning start. The events of four years ago, however, prove that a slow opening to the campaign need not create a mood of despondency.</p> <p>In Athens the early progress of the British team was so faltering that, only four days into the Games, the tabloids were calling for them to be brought home - not quite in chains but almost - before they could inflict further humiliation upon themselves. Cyclists, judokas, marksmen and horsewomen alike had failed to live up to expectations. In the pool the fancied swimmers and divers were floundering. A chastened Tim Henman had been to see Simon Clegg, Team GB's chef de mission, to apologise for losing his first-round singles match in straight sets. </p> <p>The team stayed on, of course. Although an aghast nation was forced to watch as Paula Radcliffe stumbled helplessly to a tearful halt before the end of the marathon, the derision subsided as the rest gradually turned their fortunes around. Hoy, Wiggins, the three-day eventer Leslie Law, the yachtsman Ben Ainslie, the three blondes in a boat and the men's coxless four laid the golden foundation, and an athletics team that seemed about to betray their heritage by drawing a complete blank suddenly redeemed themselves with an unprecedented 800-1500m double for Kelly Holmes and a storming win for the men's 4x100 squad. A total of 30 medals - nine gold, nine silver and 12 bronze - represented Britain's second best total of all time, beaten only in Los Angeles in 1984, the year of the eastern bloc boycott.</p> <p>Yesterday's withdrawal of the boxer Frankie Gavin will have modified the target set by UK Sport of 35 medals overall, including 12 golds - enough, in its calculations, to get the team into a projected eighth place in the overall table.</p> <p>There is no Holmes this time, the reshaped men's sprint relay team is hardly the force it was and a series of injuries and accidents is casting a shadow over Radcliffe's participation. The track and field, too, may again look a barren prospect, only the triple jumper Phillips Idowu, the heptathlete Kelly Sotherton and Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders in the 400m looking like serious contenders for gold.</p> <p>Yet there are still more than enough reasons to anticipate that general enjoyment will be spiced with the possibility of British success: Ainslie, Cooke, Daley, Faulds, Tweddle, the taekwondoists Sarah Stevenson and Aaron Cook, the trio of women in the Yngling boat, the archer Alan Wills, the women's quad sculls and the men's lightweight double sculls, the triathletes Tim Don, Will Clarke and Helen Tucket, the badminton pair Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson, the horseman William Fox-Pitt, the canoeists Campbell Walsh and Tim Brabants, the modern pentathletes Heather Fell and Katy Livingston, the judoka Karina Bryant, and the swimmers Rebecca Adlington in the 800m freestyle and David Davies in the brand-new 10km open-water race. And there may, of course, be the odd pleasant surprise.</p> <p>But the Games also have a tradition of bringing us closer to sportsmen and women with whom we share no affiliations of ethnicity or nationhood. The deeds of men and women with names such as Nurmi, Blankers-Koen, Zatopek, Clay, Bikila, Beamon, Fosbury, Spitz, Comaneci, Lewis, Bubka, Egerszegi and Fu Minxia bring us all closer together as we share glimpses of the extent of human potential. Zatopek's triple of 5000m, 10,000, and marathon in Helsinki in 1952, Beamon's leap of 8.90m in Mexico in 1968 and Comaneci's perfect 10 on the asymmetrical bars in Montreal in 1976 were superhuman feats but they would not have carried half the resonance had they been achieved in any other context.</p> <p>Usain Bolt of Jamaica in the 100m and 200m sprints, Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia in the pole vault and Michael Phelps of the US, aiming at a record eight golds in the pool, are among those most likely to transfix viewers around the world. Were Radcliffe to fight her way to redemption, the headlines would be ready-made.</p> <p>But it is hard to turn away from Britain's track cyclists. As the hyper-intense Romero makes her turbo-roller whine like a departing 747, the muscular Hoy practises explosive starts with the other members of the sprint squad, and the team pursuit quartet glide around the steeply banked Siberian pine track, switching positions at top speed with millimetre-perfect accuracy, the measure of the champion athlete's obsession comes into focus, and makes perfect sense.</p> <p>Tonight, in front of 91,000 spectators and many millions around the world, China's coming-out party will start with a ceremony that promises to be long, loud and relentlessly spectacular. But the real truth was to be found yesterday in the pool of sweat gathering beneath a man going nowhere on the way to complete fulfilment.</p>",
  "<p>\"Man must defeat the heavens.\" Thus spoke Mao Zedong, and man duly set about learning how to vanquish the weather as part of the Great Leap Forward.</p> <p>China's Weather Modification Office now employs almost 53,000 people, making it slightly heavier on rainmaking personnel than the X-Men and various Star Trek planets. In two years it will be a stand-alone ministry and its hardware arsenal includes planes, thousands of rocket launchers and anti-aircraft guns.</p> <p>Yet today, a single question dominates the Weather Modification Office's agenda: can it make it turn out nice for the Olympic Games opening ceremony? Strike that. Beijing has commuted its expectations over the past week. Can the WMO at least lighten the forecasted rains?</p> <p>The short answer is: possibly. China has declared itself the world's leading force in weather control but this superpower's superpower is still at the \"not fully mastered\" stage - a bit like when Spiderman cannot shoot the web out of his fingers every time.</p> <p>\"Dispersal of clouds and dispersal of rain are only at the stage of experimentation\" is all the bureau chief, Zhang Qiang, will say. \"We will see if certain weather conditions will affect Beijing, then we can see if we need to apply such techniques.\" Many scientists remain sceptical as to whether cloud-seeding really works but the Chinese claim to have deployed the technology with great results at events less scrutinised than the Olympic Games. It was clement at the giant panda festival in Sichuan a couple of years ago, apparently.</p> <p>In Star Trek most sophisticated planets and colonies that controlled their weather tended to use systems such as weather modification nets. The Chinese have gone with something a bit different: a compound located in the west of Beijing, a \u00a350m annual budget, a regular supply of artillery from State-Owned Factory No556 in Inner Mongolia and around 37,000 part-time weather modifiers. The obstacles to the All England Club rolling out the same approach are clear.</p> <p>How does one get into the part-time weather modification game? Generally Chinese citizens are informed by the government that they will be taking up the job, whereupon they are retrained and add the skill to their portfolio - namely, being a peasant farmer. Artillery positions and rocket launchers are set up on the high points of the lands they farm and they are drilled to load up at the first sign of raindrops and await instructions. The orders emanate from Beijing HQ, then filter down to sub-bureaus, who in turn mobilise the ground operatives by mobile phone. If Beijing has deemed it the wrong sort of rain, the farmer-rainmakers are stood down.</p> <p>In the shells - and there is 50 yuan to be made for every one fired - is silver iodide, whose rain-making properties were first discovered in America in 1946 by the atmospheric scientist Bernard Vonnegut, brother of the writer Kurt. The novelist would later give crystallography of water a role in his novel Cat's Cradle, whose central character is a scientist based on his brother's colleague, the Nobel Prize-winner Irving Langmuir, but, as if to underscore Vonnegut's point, Bernard's discovery was eventually co-opted for war. Project Popeye was a US military operation which ran for five years during the Vietnam conflict, in which cloud-seeding extended the monsoon season over Laos, turning the Ho Chi Minh trail into a quagmire.</p> <p>Today, though, the Chinese boffins are bent on using their powers for good, with the basic Beijing strategy over the next fortnight being to intercept any clouds heading in and get them to rain themselves out before they hit town. The precedent would be the 1980 Moscow Games, where the Soviets boasted their superior cloud-seeding technology ensured the sun shone throughout. Western scientists might have been sceptical but the programme inspired China. In 2005 it seems the glorious Moscow weather - for a celebration to mark 60 years since the end of the second world war - spurred China to step up its own programme. Showers failed to rain on the parade and Chinese thoughts turned to their Olympics.</p> <p>These days some Beijingers are convinced they can tell when rain has been artificially created, citing telltale signs such as clear skies or giant drops. Many unconvinced outsiders prefer to see the entire business as indicative of the Chinese state's conviction that it can control absolutely everything.</p> <p>Only time will show if their superpower will reach its zenith for this evening's ceremony. But it is likely to be a uniquely pressurised fortnight for the Weather Modification Office and its unseen army. As Spiderman's uncle pointed out, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>",
  "<p>To-day Learie Constantine takes his benefit at Nelson; given a fine day, he is certain to do some wonderful deed, for he is a genius - if genius means originality.</p> <p>He expresses not only himself but the West Indian; as soon as L. N. Constantine leaps into the field we know that he is not an Englishman, not an Australian - and we need not look at his colour. </p> <p>The strokes he makes, the fast balls he hurls from him, and his dartings and twistings in the field - all these actions of Constantine are racial, stirred by impulses born in the blood.</p> <p>When Constantine plays cricket the game is at its beginnings - there is nothing in the world for him but a ball to hit and a horizon to hit into, and three stumps to send flying and two batsmen to run out - both at once if the law would only allow it - as well as a ball to catch, wherever skied. </p> <p>Constantine should be given first refusal of all catches, from deep long-on to third man. Cricket is Constantine's element, so much so that to say he plays cricket is as though we were to say that a fish goes swimming.</p> <p>His batting is a law unto itself. He makes a mess of the best length. The power of his pulls, short-armed and swift, fills fieldsmen with terror; the last thing indeed that fieldsmen think about when Constantine is batting is saving boundaries; a less academic point is the saving of heads and limbs.</p> <p>Constantine can cut from the middle stump down to third man with a stab of the bat that seems as though art and culture had suddenly flashed from primitive voracity.</p> <p>He will lie back on his right foot and force an accurate inswinger past mid-on - or perhaps past mid-off - with a velocity that threatens broken legs. He makes the largest ground shrink; he threatens roofs on the houses in contiguous districts. And this batsmanship is not irrational: it knows its own logic - the tiger on the kill is as subtle as it is beautiful and elemental.</p> <p>Constantine bowls fast because he is a man who has never grown up. He runs to the wicket as though for dear life, swings his arm without a jump, and sometimes his cap blows off behind him. When the batsman cuts him or pulls him you can see that Constantine's first instinct is to chase the ball himself. He loves the game, and if everybody played it with Constantine's gusto there would be nobody who did not love it.</p>",
  "<p>Ryanair slashed the price of one in five seats yesterday after Europe's largest budget carrier admitted it cannot fill its planes and cover crippling fuel costs if it raises fares.</p> <p>The move came despite industry-wide capacity cuts that are expected to put upward pressure on fares. Instead, Ryanair fired the first salvo in a price war yesterday by halving its cheapest fares in September, offering 1m seats at \u00a35 including charges and taxes next month. It will lose at least \u00a35 on each British sale, because the fare does not cover the \u00a310 air passenger duty charge. </p> <p>Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the primary motive for the sale was to stimulate faltering demand rather than drive rivals out of business. The move represents a halving of Ryanair's cheapest fares, which represent about 50% of the seats sold. Ryanair services hit profit targets when the planes are 80% full and O'Leary admitted the airline was having to \"dump\" fares in order to fill its planes, amid weakening demand for seats.</p> <p>\"We will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80%,\" said O'Leary. \"If passengers are booking ahead of the 80% seat target, we will close off the cheap seats. If we are booking behind it, we will open up more cheap fares.\" </p> <p>The Ryanair boss added that high oil prices will have a far greater impact on financially weak airlines than another cut-price seat offer. \"Ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall,\" he said. </p> <p>O'Leary's counterpart at British Airways, Willie Walsh, has warned that BA's average fare will have to rise by at least 3% in order to cover fuel costs. But the strategy is hitting customer numbers - BA flew 94,000 fewer passengers last month, a 3.5% fall. </p> <p>Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at ABN Amro, said predictions of across-the-board fare increases are unlikely to be fulfilled, particularly if no-frills carriers such as Ryanair continue to pursue steep growth targets. \"Airlines are dealing with high oil prices, weakening demand and the need to maximise revenues in different ways,\" he said. \"BA is increasing average fares but letting the number of seats sold per flight slip. That does not work with Ryanair's network or its product. Plus Ryanair is trying to grow at 14% per year while BA is shrinking. Different growth profiles means different reactions on fares.\"</p> <p>Ryanair is heading for its first loss in 20 years - the Dublin-based carrier said last month that it would plunge from a profit last year of \u20ac439m (\u00a3347m) to a loss of up to \u20ac60m if the cost of keeping planes in the air stayed at record levels. The profit warning was compounded by an admission that the sales outlook was weaker than expected and a planned 5% fares increase would have to be reversed.</p> <p>The carrier is grounding 20 planes this winter in order to conserve costs, a move being replicated across the industry with a 7% capacity cut among all airlines - equivalent to nearly 60m fewer seats - due in the final quarter of 2008. Some experts have warned fares will rise as a result, but low-budget carriers such as Ryanair, whose business model is predicated on the pile-high-sell-cheap principle, are under pressure to slash ticket prices.</p> <p>O'Leary said he wanted a recent fall in the oil price from $147 to about $120 a barrel to be reversed, in order to ensure Europe's most cash-strapped airlines were not bailed out by banks willing to take a risk on an industry revival.</p> <p>\"If airlines get a break in the oil price, some of them will get financing from some idiot. The more expensive oil is, the faster we roll up the loss-making companies that are not going to survive anyway.\"</p> <p>O'Leary also confirmed plans to launch hand luggage-only flights in the autumn. The experiment will be conducted on four routes: Dublin to Cork, London to Glasgow, Rome to Milan Bergamo and Frankfurt Hahn to Berlin. About four out of 10 Ryanair passengers travel without bags since the airline introduced check-in fees.</p> <h2>Back story</h2> <p>Ryanair and easyJet focus on the <strong>load factor </strong>or seats sold per flight. Both airlines aim for a load factor of about <strong>85%</strong> and set fares accordingly. Even if <strong>fare revenue </strong>is low, carriers make extra profits by charging for <strong>bag check-in</strong> and <strong>brokering </strong>hotel and car hire deals. Ryanair passengers on ultra-<strong>cheap fares </strong>raise little ticket revenue, but are more likely to hire cars and book hotels. <strong>Late bookers </strong>pay higher fares but are less likely to go for <strong>hotel and car deals</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, is facing the prospect of being thrown out of office after the country's fragile coalition government yesterday announced plans to impeach him.</p> <p>The move plunged nuclear-armed Pakistan into fresh political turmoil, as it grapples to cope with a biting economic downturn and a security crisis that has seen Taliban-inspired militants take over its border region with Afghanistan and stage suicide bomb attacks across the country. </p> <p>Musharraf is believed to have told supporters that he will fight the impeachment proceedings. He was plotting his response yesterday with advisers, and finally cancelled an on-off trip to the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. </p> <p>\"We elected him and now we will support him to defeat this move,\" said Kamil Ali Agha, a leader of the main pro-Musharraf party. </p> <p>Pakistan's top military commanders also reportedly met yesterday, and the reaction of the army - which until recently was led by the president - is anxiously awaited by politicians and the public.</p> <p>The breakthrough for the coalition, which has been able to agree on little since taking office four months ago, came after three days of talks between the Pakistan People's party, led by Asif Zardari, and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N.</p> <p>\"We want to make a new Pakistan,\" Zardari said at a press conference in Islamabad. \"We have the votes and the political will.\" </p> <p>To instigate an impeachment, the coalition must prove that the president has subverted the constitution or is guilty of gross misconduct. Musharraf's dismissal in November of the country's judiciary and suspension of the constitution for six weeks may form the basis of this.</p> <p>However, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in parliament, and the numbers are close. Musharraf's trump card may now be to use his power to dismiss parliament before it gets a chance to move the impeachment motion, under a constitutional mechanism that was used three times in the 90s to sack governments. If the president believes that the army is with him, he may be tempted to use this authority.</p> <p>Impeachment has never been used in Pakistan before and there are fears that it could provoke another military intervention. \"This decision was taken in haste. They are playing with fire,\" said Amin Fahim, an estranged senior member of the People's party. \"Every action has a reaction.\" </p> <p>The Pakistani military has indicated that it wishes to stay out of politics following Musharraf's decision to give up the job of army chief in November, when he clung on to his other role of president. </p> <p>However, it is unclear whether the men in uniform, who have staged multiple coups over the course of Pakistan's turbulent history, will stand aside while a former army chief is humiliated and dragged out of office.</p> <p>Sharif was thrown out of office by Musharraf in 1999, and many believe he is bent on revenge. Until now, Zardari has been much more reluctant to confront the president, procrastinating on the coalition's commitment to restore the judiciary. </p> <p>\"Impeachment is a device to distract attention from the restoration of the judges,\" said Iqbal Haider, a former law minister under Benazir Bhutto's government of the 90s. </p> <p>But analysts said it would be difficult for Zardari to maintain credibility if he did not follow through with the impeachment threat. </p> <p>\"Our services to democracy are well documented,\" Zardari said. \"I need no proof, no documentation from anyone ... the voice of the parliament is the demand of the people.\" </p> <p>In the past, Musharraf has enjoyed strong support from Washington, as a major ally in the \"war on terror\"; the US has given Pakistan billions of dollars in military aid. </p> <p>However, it now appears that the US may have given up on him. The White House said last night that impeachment was an \"internal matter\" for Pakistan.</p>",
  "<p>Images of drunken language students running amok on Malta's streets and having sex on the beach made headlines last summer, while locals protested loudly against the chaos caused by the young foreigners.</p> <p>This year a shake-up of English language tourism packages seems to be having the desired effect as schools and local authorities seek to find a compromise between young people's studying and carousing.</p> <p>However, this is not easy for the sun-and-sea destination that has earned a reputation among Europe's youth as a haven for late-night revelry.</p> <p>While schools were under the spotlight when public disturbances multiplied during the 2007 summer season, the problem extends beyond the English language learning sector. The Mediterranean island is trying to change its permissive attitude towards alcohol in an attempt to control underage drinking.</p> <p>In a bid to avoid a repeat of last summer's problems, the Federation of English Language Schools (Feltom) has teamed up with the tourism authority, local councils and the police.</p> <p>\"We've been doing quite a lot in the past few months to pre-empt any issues of student misbehaviour,\" said Feltom president Andrew Mangion.</p> <p>Feltom has collaborated with the Malta Tourism Authority to issue a booklet in Spanish outlining guidelines for student behaviour. Students are also required to sign a code of conduct before travelling to Malta.</p> <p>Last year the island received an unprecedented influx of students from Spain. However, the number of Spaniards arriving this year is expected to go down by a third. \"A drop that is happening worldwide, due to a decrease in the uptake of government scholarships,\" Mangion explained.</p> <p>The sales and marketing executive at the International English Language School (IELS), Isabelle Conti, confirmed dwindling Spanish arrivals.</p> <p>\"Their numbers have decreased drastically this year. They come here mostly to have fun but things were blown out of proportion a bit last summer,\" said Conti.</p> <p>The student behaviour booklet is now being translated to other languages and besides outlining guidelines for acceptable conduct it provides a list of useful contacts and a freephone emergency number.</p> <p>IELS and other schools have also agreed curfew times with host families, youth hostels and student residences.</p> <p>\"We request our students staying in hostels and student residences to sign a logbook upon their return at night. If they don't respect the curfew, we would know. We call them in, speak to them and follow it up,\" said Conti.</p> <p>Kathleen von Schloss Cremona, a consultant at Inlingua School of Languages, says the controls introduced over the past year are working, although the bulk of young language students have yet to arrive.</p> <p>\"So far, so good,\" Cremona said. </p> <p>\"There are definitely better controls this year. Host families are enforcing curfew times that are immediately made clear to the students. You obviously get the odd student who sleeps out at night and skips classes the next day, but this is followed up immediately,\" Mangion said. </p> <p>\"Schools, generally, have similar policies to regulate student behaviour,\" Mangion added. \"If the students are not adults, then they will be the responsibility of the school during lessons or at events organised by the school. They have to be accompanied by teachers or local leaders, and in cases of student groups they might have foreign leaders on excursions or night activities.\"</p> <p>Schools accredited by Feltom have curfew times depending on the age of students. \"If these are not respected there are set disciplinary procedures - starting from speaking to the students concerned and contacting their parents and agencies. In extreme cases, when they keep breaking the rules and pose a threat to themselves, to other students or to public peace, they are repatriated,\" Mangion said.</p> <p>Even on the streets of Paceville, Malta's main tourist entertainment centre, which became notorious for drunken behaviour last year, there seems to be a gradual improvement. Since being in the media spotlight, the seaside resort has been under tighter scrutiny. Besides a beefed-up police presence, CCTV has been installed in popular areas. </p> <p>Paceville's local authorities are also proposing a bylaw that would forbid anyone from carrying alcoholic beverages in the streets.</p> <p>Meanwhile Feltom is also organising evening parties catering especially for under-18-year-olds in alcohol-free environments.</p> <p>\"It's a way of taking them out of Paceville and away from densely inhabited areas,\" Mangion said about the parties, which are organised every week. \"Almost all of our member schools go for them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most of us would agree that the world is full of fascinating people; unlike most of us, however, the film-maker Jonathan Demme seems to be compelled to make documentaries about them, all at the same time. As a result, the atmosphere in his New York apartment is one of low-level hysteria, as if everyone present has been drinking too much coffee. At an all-day production meeting that is just dispersing, the 64-year-old director and his collaborators have been discussing a new film about Bob Marley; there's also a Neil Young movie in the works - Demme's second - as well as a project following families made homeless by Hurricane Katrina. Then there are the short works he's been posting on YouTube and, finally, the movie we're meeting to discuss, Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains, about the post-presidential adventures of Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>Documentaries have always been a part of Demme's output, but these days the director of big-budget fictions such as The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia seems intoxicated by fact. \"I can sometimes fall victim to my own enthusiasm,\" he concedes. \"Especially now, with all the new technology, because even I can shoot the camera. I'm always ready to jump up and say, 'Let's film that!'\" He rubs his eyes and blinks, a little sheepishly. \"Filming stuff is great,\" he says, as if it were a recent discovery.</p> <p>The 39th president of the United States might not sound like the most promising of subjects. He's a hero to many for the humanitarian work he's done since leaving office in 1981, but not necessarily a very interesting hero. To some on the American right, he's a scold and a has-been, whose ultra-liberal views are best ignored. But in Demme's film, which follows Carter on the 2006 publicity tour for his controversial book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, he emerges as a compelling character - stubborn yet compassionate, unfazed by vicious criticism, yet ready to burst into tears as soon as he recalls his Georgia childhood. Pulling his wheeled suitcase behind him - Carter won't let anyone else touch it - the 83-year-old ex-president tirelessly criss-crosses the country on commercial flights, signing books in stores, giving TV and radio interviews and responding to mounting hostility, most of the time with implacable patience. </p> <p>Demme says he thinks of the film as a western. \"The more I thought about Carter, the more I started thinking about High Noon,\" he says. \"The idea of the ageing peacemaker who should be in retirement, having once again to strap on his guns - in Jimmy Carter's case, he's strapping on his heart and soul - and coming forth into town, one last time, to confront his adversaries, those who would perpetuate violence. It's Gary Cooper, striding down the street, all alone: no one's stronger than the really old guy who takes on a good mission when he should be allowed to be on the porch in his rocking chair.\"</p> <p>Carter's mission isn't quite as incendiary as his book title suggests. As he tirelessly explains to interviewers who haven't read his book, he uses the word \"apartheid\" to describe the situation in the occupied territories, not in Israel. Primarily, he wants to communicate the fact - little-known in much of America - that the Israeli-built security barrier makes deep incursions into Palestinian territory. And he wants the two sides to talk. But his analogy with South Africa provokes a parade of critics, from a coalition of Arizona rabbis to the high-profile Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who accuse him of antisemitism, plagiarism, senility and more.</p> <p>Demme received his earliest cinematic education from the exploitation director Roger Corman - Demme's first movie was Caged Heat, an instance of the lurid \"women in prison\" genre - and credits Corman with first teaching him that a film should never grow too enamoured of its hero. \"One of the very first things Corman tells you, as a new director, is that you've got to make sure your adversary is every bit as strong and interesting as your protagonist,\" he says. \"So when we were filming at the Carter Centre in Atlanta, and the consul from Israel was identified as being in the audience, I was, like, 'Oh my God, I've got to get him.' I was desperate for points of view in opposition. I chased him across the grounds of the Carter Centre, and in the end I was lucky enough to have this very attractive guy, giving a very heartfelt, non-didactic comment.\" </p> <p>Even Dershowitz, whose initial media attacks on Carter bordered on the rabid, comes across as eminently reasonable, scrupulously fact-checking his broadsides before unleashing them. \"He was a tremendously important figure to have in there,\" Demme says. \"As a person of his generation, I felt his pain. I grew up with the emerging documentation of the Holocaust; I'm not Jewish, yet I know the profound impact that had on me. So if you're a Jewish-American of that generation ... I get Dershowitz's pain, and his rage.\"</p> <p>Man from Plains may also be the most candid portrayal ever of the personal and emotional life of a former president. We get to see Carter off-duty at local cook-outs in Plains, the small Georgia town where he was born, and cycling slightly goofily down its main street with his wife, Rosalynn; he explains how they read the Bible to each other at night - on the phone, if necessary - before going to sleep. (\"Shocking intimacy!\" says Demme.) Carter's encounters with strangers seem intimate, too: fans at book signings gaze at him with uncensored affection; TV makeup artists flirt openly. Even the film's only foray into archive footage, an account of the brokering of the Camp David accords, is memorable less for the grand historical events it records than for the images of a sleepy but determined Carter, shuttling back and forth through the night between Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat's cabins in the Maryland countryside. </p> <p>\"In America, you almost want to apologise for being a Jimmy Carter fan,\" says Demme, \"but I don't apologise. Surely now, in the run-up to this particular election, Jimmy Carter must be seen as the great president.\" Carter's term is probably best remembered for the drawn-out humiliation of the Iranian hostage crisis, his handling of which has been blamed for fuelling the rise of Islamist extremism - though Carter is at pains to remind interviewers in the film that all the hostages escaped alive, and no Iranians died, either. (Eight US service personnel were killed.) Barack Obama, for several reasons, has been derisively described recently by rightwingers in America as a new Carter. But to Demme, that's a compliment and not necessarily one Obama deserves. The Democratic candidate has promised to open dialogues with the nation's enemies if elected, but on the Middle East Demme argues that he's been subject to \"brainwashing\" by Aipac, the pro-Israel lobby group, and is \"kowtowing to the pro-Israeli lobby position, and showing incredible insensitivity to the Palestinian side. Carter never got brainwashed ... maybe that's why he didn't get a second term.\" (Demme has also said he would like to \"strap George Bush into a chair and make him watch [Man from Plains] again and again and again.\")</p> <p>Demme had made plenty of factual films before - a sequence of movies about the struggle for democracy in Haiti and numerous concert films such as Stop Making Sense, about Talking Heads. Following Carter, though, his control over unfolding events was at an all-time minimum. One of the most dramatic moments that he shot was never screened - an impassioned meeting between Carter and a group of Arizona rabbis furious at his book. \"They hit him with all the strong stuff, and he responded; he didn't persuade anyone, nor was his mind changed, but everybody got to say what they wanted to say, and it ended beautifully, with a prayer circle. One of the rabbis gave a blessing and wept.\" Everyone present agreed to be filmed, but one of the rabbis later threatened legal action if the footage was used. The result is a strange sequence of silences - we hear some of Carter's words, but not those of the people he's responding to, and the rabbis' faces are blurred - that is, in its own way, an eloquent demonstration of how hard it is to talk about the Middle East in America. \"I was devastated,\" Demme says, \"because I'd been banking on that scene. But then I thought, well, this is a documentary, and this is what happened.\"</p> <p>Through cultish material like Melvin and Howard and Something Wild, Demme became at least as well known for fictional films. Later came the box office successes of Philadelphia and The Silence of the Lambs - which became only the third movie in history to win the Oscars for best director, movie, actor, actress and screenplay - and a remake of The Manchurian Candidate, starring Denzel Washington. But large-budget studio fictions \"are probably a thing of the past for me\", he says now. \"I have no interest. I'm a working film-maker, so I don't need that much money to live, and I just can't take the fashioning-of-the-product aspect to all that. I've had my fill of it.\" In fact, he has just made a fictional film - a drama called Rachel Getting Married, starring Anne Hathaway - but he shot it as a documentary, with the cinematographer Declan Quinn. \"We pretended that what the actors were doing was reality, and we responded to it as we would in any documentary,\" Demme says. \"We never did a take-two of any shot; we did the scenes a number of times, but always from a new perspective. The actors loved it, because the more you do a take, the more you're going to drain the spontaneity out of a performance.\"</p> <p>Fate did, in the end, present Demme with a cinematic confrontation in Man from Plains, despite the problem with the rabbis. Brandeis University, which has a strongly pro-Israel student body, refused his offer to speak there. Then, after much media controversy, it changed its mind. \"Shamefully, I was delighted when Brandeis refused him permission to come - because now we have some adversaries,\" Demme recalls. \"And then they decided, no, he could come ... so that gave us our final gunfight! He'll waltz on to this fiercely pro-Israel campus, and confront the students, and his views will be tested to the maximum.\" Carter and the students do have a frank exchange of opinions; nobody ends up looking worse for having agreed to talk. \"And then he jumps in the car to the airport, and he's off to Darfur!\" Demme says. \"Fantastic! It's, like, 'Who was that masked orator?'\"</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains is released on August 15.</strong></p>",

He is charged with various offences; they're not as severe [as the charge against Borberg] but he has been remanded in custody.\"</p> <p>The soldier who shot Abu-Rahma in the foot, and who was under Borberg's command, also faces military charges. He alleges that he fired the bullet after Borberg said: \"Shoot a rubber bullet at him.\"</p> <p>Together, the four human rights organisations are to mount a case in Israel's high court to intervene in secretive military court procedures in an attempt to charge Borberg with a criminal offence.</p> <p>Borberg said he had resigned from his post \"for the good of the soldier, the battalion and the army\", but Israel's military spokesman would not confirm whether the resignation was voluntary. \"I see myself serving for many more years at the heart of military activity,\" Borberg said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, ordered military forces to demolish the home of Ala Abu Dhaim, the East Jerusalem Palestinian who gunned down eight students in the Merkaz Harav yeshiva in March. It marks a return to the policy of using demolitions in retaliation for terrorist attacks, which was abandoned in 2005 after it was deemed ineffective.</p> <p>The homes of the two Palestinians, who in separate incidents rammed Israeli civilians with bulldozers, killing three and injuring dozens more, are also due to be destroyed. </p> <p>Jerusalem's mayor, Uri Lupolianski, said: \"The demolition will serve as a clear message that the families of every terrorist who goes out to attack and murder Israelis will also be harmed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rome's mayor, a former neo-fascist, was forced yesterday to rethink a proposal to punish poor people who rummage through bins to find food and clothing.</p> <p>His measure was one of several law and order initiatives tabled by mayors, who were given new powers this week and urged by the interior minister to be \"creative\" in tackling offensive behaviour.</p> <p>The mayor of Rome, Gianni Alemanno, announced he was rearming the municipal police and proposed a by-law to ban the removal of material from bins, but he ran into criticism. Father Luigi Ciotti, founder of a group that works with drug addicts, said: \"I understand the justified concern for hygiene and people's health. But those who rummage in rubbish skips in order to eat need to be able to live.\"</p> <p>\"It seems as if the problems of Italy are beggars and Roma,\" said Mario Marazziti, spokesman for the Sant'Egidio community, which operates a soup kitchen.</p> <p>Rome council said \"further checks\" would be carried out on the proposal. But Alemanno stressed that it did not mean the bylaw would not go ahead.</p>",
  "<p>\"Some people say I'm spiky,\" Kelly Sotherton murmurs as her big round eyes widen still further and she feigns a look of outraged innocence, \"but I don't think so. I don't bullshit, but I'm no diva. I'm not going to say I want blue smarties at this interview. I'm no different because I've got a few medals around my neck. I am outspoken and opinionated and a bit harsh but, equally, I feel I can speak more openly in public now. Before I probably just said it to myself and kept my mouth shut. But if you've got something to say you should just say it. Freedom of free speech.\"</p> <p>And so, after that refreshing burst of scatter-gun chatter, welcome to another encounter with the most forthright member of the British Olympic team. This time four years ago, when still a relatively unknown athlete from the Isle of Wight preparing for the heptathlon at the Athens Olympics, Sotherton was much less expansive. She kept her head down, feeling vaguely terrified of Denise Lewis, her training partner and the reigning Olympic champion, and their coach, the brooding Charles van Commenee.</p> <p>In the end she shocked almost everyone, including herself, by winning bronze in Athens. Van Commenee was different. His fury that Sotherton had settled for third when she could have won silver reduced her to tears. That bruising experience transformed Sotherton and even though van Commenee has long since returned to Holland they remain in close contact. His belief now surges through Sotherton.</p> <p>\"Out of eight major championships I've medaled in six,\" she says bluntly. \"I don't think there's anybody else in our team who has done that. I'm probably the most consistent person we've got. Now I just need to make it seven out of nine \u2014 and get gold as well. A good athlete will say, 'I think I can do it.' I know I can do it. That's what great athletes think. Even if it's outrageous they always believe they can do it. You've got to have that attitude \u2013 it's the difference between the people who win medals and those who just make it to the final.\"</p> <p>Her chances of winning gold in Beijing have been galvanised by the decision of her friend Carolina Kluft, the world's greatest female athlete, to abandon the heptathlon for the long jump and triple jump. \"Carolina says she wants me to win which is very nice. You wouldn't get Tyson Gay saying, 'If I'm not in Beijing I want Asafa Powell to win the 100m.' But I've been around almost as long as Carolina and I've always been the bridesmaid - so she wants me to have my turn.\"</p> <p>They are also both vocal opponents of doping. At the world championships in Osaka last August, Kluft and Sotherton were separated by Lyudmila Blonska, the Ukranian who had been banned for two years in 2003 after testing positive for steroids. Exchanging eye-rolling looks at each other, like two pals sharing their contempt for a schoolyard cheat, Sotherton and Kluft made it plain that Blonska's silver medal was unjust. \"I could have won silver and Jess Ennis [the young British athlete who finished fourth] would have won bronze. But there's nothing I can do about it. You just have to park your opinion and beat her anyway. I'll always have my suspicions about Blonska because she's never owned up or been honest. I don't talk to her but I'm civil.\"</p> <p>Sotherton says that word, \"civil\", with an icy edge that can also be heard in a sharp dismissal of her own critics. \"I don't really care what other people think but apparently I disappointed a lot of them by winning a medal in Osaka. Within the athletics fraternity there are lots of people who have opinions about me and I disappointed them by coming third rather than fourth.\"<br>She shrugs when asked the reason for such apparent enmity. \"It's probably because I say how it is or because they think I don't deserve it. But I train harder than anyone. For instance Jessica is more talented than me so I have to work harder to be as good as her. Everybody had written me off in Osaka because they were pinning all their hopes on Jessica. But I knew I was coming home with a medal. I have this drive and I'm very good at dealing with pressure.\"</p> <p>The injured Ennis will miss Beijing \u2013 so removing yet another medal contender from Sotherton's path. But she almost swallows her words, mumbling \"um, yeah\", when asked if she will win her first major gold medal. The reasons for her fleeting hesitancy are obvious for Sotherton has endured a year ravaged by injury and illness. But she quickly reiterates her readiness to win: \"I'd never train for silver or bronze. Realistically, I think I've got a massive chance of winning it.\"</p> <p>Yet Sotherton is also vulnerable. \"I had the nerves and panic attacks a few months ago, thinking 'I can't do it!' Every athlete goes through that. You start panicking even though your training suggests everything's going well. But when you have too much time you can over-think.\"</p> <p>Sotherton was at her most exposed when stricken by a mysterious kidney ailment in May. \"I've never been ill like that. I'd been tired and lethargic while training in Italy and I was in hospital on the Monday and Tuesday before they flew me home on the Wednesday. I saw a nephrologist, and had tests for a few weeks. It was effectively kidney failure \u2013 but not to the extent where I needed dialysis. But it was sensible to go to hospital because I became so ill \u2013 just like that.\"</p> <p>Sotherton snaps her fingers. \"I was that ill I couldn't stand straight. It was so painful \u2013 and the doctor hits you on the side to see if it hurts. They whack you like that - there.\"</p> <p>She mimes a karate chop and grimaces. \"I was like 'Aagghh! Aagghh!' because I was in such pain. My physio was thinking, 'what is that woman doing - hitting you that hard?' But it wasn't really that hard \u2013 the kidneys just hurt. I was scared because I didn't know what was going to happen. But I have a knack, touch wood, of recovering.\"</p> <p>As the exact cause of her collapse remains unknown Sotherton concedes that she could succumb again. \"You have to take that risk. Maybe if I pushed myself too hard it might bring it back on. I don't know \u2013 but at least I'm being tested regularly, both blood and urine, so I'll know instantly. But I've always been generally quite healthy even if I suffer numerous injuries. This year I had a bad ligament in my foot, bulging discs in my back, the kidney problem and then I tore a pectineus muscle \u2013 so it's constant. If I ever went injury-free to a competition I'd be amazed.\"</p> <p>Sotherton's spirit is undimmed. Her winning weekend in Beijing is already mapped out in her head. She confirms that the details were finalised as soon as she saw the fixture list for the new football season with her beloved Arsenal at home to West Brom next Saturday \u2013 the final day of the heptathlon. \"By the time I finish my 800m hopefully the Arsenal game won't have started. This is the plan, hopefully, if all goes well. I'll go to the BBC with gold round my neck, do the interview and I'll then say, 'Can I can sit and watch Arsenal on the telly?'\"</p> <p>She then plans to make a triumphant return home and compete in the Aviva British Grand Prix in Gateshead on 31 August before giving into footballing fandom \u2013 already illustrated by her owning a cat called Kolo, named after Arsenal's Kolo Tour\u00e9. Gold in Beijing should mean that she'll have no trouble blagging a couple of seats to every home match at the Emirates.</p> <p>\"I'll be asking to if I can sit in the directors' box or, even better, with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger on the touchline. That would be my dream. It would be fantastic if he'd let me sit down there with him.\"</p> <p>In her sudden excitement she blurts out that she would like to follow gold in Beijing with another in London in 2012. \"Two gold medals might give me just enough money to buy myself a stake in Arsenal. I could go on the board or something. God, that would be awesome.\"</p> <p>Sotherton is as amusing when considering what she might really do after her expected retirement at the age of 35 in 2012. \"Lots of my friends say I'd be a great high-flying businesswoman. I don't take any shit and I get on with really difficult people. I talk straight and I find that people who nobody likes actually like me. I suppose it takes one to know one. But I feel that whatever avenue I choose I'll be quite successful. I know how to work hard and I don't take blah-blah-blah from anyone. They'll be gone-gone-gone. I'll probably be like Alan Sugar in the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>One day Ma Jian, who grew up in Qingdao, on the Yellow Sea, was returning from the beach when he passed a rubbish collector pushing a cart piled high with books. They had fallen foul of the cultural revolution, and were on their way to a pyre. He asked if he could have one. No, came the answer. Could he just have an illustration then? Permission was reluctantly granted and a page ripped out. And another? Yes - but then the book was snatched away. He kept those pages for years. </p> <p>The printed word has been Ma's talisman ever since, and he has hung on through thick and thin: being hounded from his state job; his first wife leaving him; having his work banned (he wrote, in Stick Out Your Tongue, of the desecration of Tibet, both from within and without - it too was burned in the streets); going into exile, first to Hong Kong and then - despite the fact that he speaks no English - London; beginning a new life with Flora Drew, his translator and mother of their children, Jack and Isabella. </p> <p>They met when she was making a documentary on the 1997 Hong Kong handover and he was one of the only locals willing to speak out against China. He gave her his books and proposed within the week (they still haven't quite managed the marriage bit). Their white living room, where he sips chrysanthemum tea and watches her carefully convert his words into English, contains novels by Nabokov and DH Lawrence; a photograph of Samuel Beckett hangs on the study wall. It is a far cry from the devastation of his latest novel, Beijing Coma, which is narrated by a victim of the Tiananmen Square massacre who, though paralysed, lives long enough to see his apartment block razed by developers. </p> <p>The 54-year-old has never been able to leave his homeland completely behind, and when we met he was preparing to return to Beijing, something he does a couple of times a year, this time to soak up the atmosphere. \"The government has called on its people, asking for self-sacrifice, for people willing to devote themselves to the nation, and it has picked out its own heroes - it's just like the great mass movements of the past.\" We may read stories of lessons in English and etiquette, but Ma has heard of more sinister controls at work. \"Street hairdressers have been given red armbands, and are able to report any misdemeanours or bad behaviour to the government - anyone who stands out from the crowd, anyone who might arouse suspicion, people who have come in from the countryside to petition the authorities about local injustices, people who are shabbily dressed - these people with red armbands have the authority to make citizen's arrests or to hand them over to the police.\" </p> <p>Students on holiday have been told to stay in their home towns, he says; Beijing citizens have been informed it's best to leave the streets clear for foreigners; artists have been prevented from returning to China or had exhibitions banned: \"There are fascistic elements to it, this idea of the mass cleansing, the purging of the city, of the disabled and mentally unstable, of all subversives and outsiders.\" He is especially struck by the fact that a key Olympic route has been designed by the son of Albert Speer, Hitler's favourite architect. </p> <p>And in these crackdowns he sees both hubris and fear. On the one hand, there is \"inflated pride; the fusion of years of nationalistic propaganda, with the economic powerhouse China has become, has created a feeling that it's now the centre of the world, and that foreigners come to them with begging hands.\" At the same time, he believes, \"the root of this desire to put on a great show stems from the authorities' own loss of faith in themselves. And they also realise that, despite the great rise in nationalism, the people don't believe in this empty ideology either.\" </p> <p>When he returned before, he thought there was a real excitement about the Olympics, a feeling that China's time had come. \"But slowly, especially in this last year, there's been a change of mood, and many people are beginning to feel as though they are pawns in a huge game, that their lives have actually become less free; more restricted. There's this great feeling of nervousness.\" And \"a country that relies on police, on the military, to retain control will find that in such a situation any underlying discontent will burst out\". He notes that in the past few months there have been spontaneous revolts in Yunnan, in Guangxi, and in Guizhou province, where locals burned down the public security office. Last month, a man called Yang Jia murdered six policemen. \"He has now become a sort of national hero.\" This month, in Kunming in south-west China, two buses were bombed. \"The government said this is nothing to do with the Olympics but there is a feeling that there is some organised effort to make a stand.\" This week, 16 policemen were killed in a grenade attack in the north-west region of Xinjiang. </p> <p>Does he really think that the games could be used as a focus for organised insurrection, as Gorbachev's visit in 1989 (and the death of reformist secretary general Hu Yaobang) was used in the marches on Tiananmen? \"I feel that the general mood in the country is that they're waiting. There's almost an expectation of some sinister event. And it's not just the people who are feeling nervous - it's the whole nation, including the authorities. There's almost this feeling of impending doom. You go on to the tube in Beijing and you're checked as thoroughly as if you're boarding a plane. Tiananmen Square, that vast, supposedly public plaza, is riddled with plainclothes policemen who check your shoes and bags. So one has to ask oneself, 'What has this event given to China?' It was supposed to bring China into the west. But all it has achieved is the demolition of great swathes of traditional Chinese life. All that's left now is the Communist party and possibly 80 national leaders attending the opening ceremony and a few sportsmen fighting over gold medals.\"</p> <p>Ma's critics believe that this is a characteristic bitterness; that he has been away from China too long to have any effect within it, and that his fiction is too focused on a Manichean past for his fast-modernising countrymen, and inaccessible to westerners. This is perhaps a bit harsh. And Ma, for his part, believes that there is an important place for acts of witness, that individual and collective memory must be fought for. A striking theme in Beijing Coma, for example, is its illustration of how humiliation and fear are internalised by families and passed down, largely as amnesia. Ma's hero, Dai Wei, grows up hating his father because he spent years in a \"reform through labour\" camp, meaning Dai is scorned at school and his mother alienated by the party; only when, after his father's death, he finds diaries describing the starvation in these camps, the torture, the small acts of heroism, does he understand what made his father the broken man he knew. </p> <p>Ma's grandfather, a landlord and tea connoisseur, was executed in the cultural revolution, but his father never spoke of it. Decades passed before Ma visited his ancestral village and discovered small facts, such as how tall his grandfather was, and that he had just started up a cultural troupe when he died, but \"I couldn't ask why was he arrested, who arrested him, where was he taken, how exactly did he die - there was no way of finding out. But it made me understand why my father lived in such fear all his life. And it was only when my father died that I found in his drawer a self-criticism he'd written, and realised that he lived in constant fear of being arrested.\" There was no grave, and no bones, but before he left Ma took a clod of earth, buried it, and gave it a gravestone. </p> <p>And the pattern has been repeated in Ma's life: he has been a target of government surveillance since his mid-20s; by the time he was 30 his ex-wife, a dancer in a propaganda troupe, severed his contact with their daughter, Nannan. He can talk to her now, but he is dismayed about the extent to which she has absorbed the party line. She refuses to visit him in Britain, and nags him not to meet certain friends; she has stopped reading the BBC cuttings he sends her about China because she says they're too negative. \"There is an inescapable bond. But if I wasn't her father I would be the kind of person she would have nothing to do with.\" </p> <p>It exacerbates how much of an outsider he feels, as a resident of London unable to speak English (\"I feel like I've come through customs but am still collecting luggage\"), a citizen of China stripped of his authorial voice - but he knows this distance is also his strength. He was in Hong Kong when the Tiananmen protests started and he returned to see what was going on. \"I was there, in the mass of sweaty bodies swaying the square\" - but because he was older, a writer and outcast, he just watched. (Beijing Coma details not just the brutality of the authorities, but the callow confusion and power struggles among the students.) On May 28 1989, his brother had an accident and Ma dashed to his bedside. It was there he heard about the massacre. It felt, he says, as though everyone he knew had been killed, or spiritually crushed, and in what would, years later, give him a guiding metaphor, only his brother, freed into a coma, seemed safe. </p> <p>Ma sees the coma as a stroke of luck for him, too: \"Not only because I might have ended up among the dead, but also for my work as a writer. Many people who witnessed Tiananmen firsthand have been unable to write about it, and that distance, and the fact that I had to reimagine it, and piece bits together, means that I've been able to look at it in the cold light of day and really examine its importance.\" He hopes to be able to do the same again about the coming days.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Beijing Coma, translated by Flora Drew, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus. </p> <p>More on Chinese literature: <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/books/chineseliterature\">theguardian.com/books/chineseliterature</a></p>",
  "<p>The England bowlers' collective, led by a rejuvenated Steve Harmison, gave Kevin Pietersen the sort of start to his reign as captain for which two days ago he would have traded all his tattoos and his earring. Well, maybe not the earring. A lost toss and the concession of an opening stand of 56 proved no barrier for England as South Africa folded after lunch, as if at an origami convention, against Harmison's pace and the controlled swing, in and out, of Jimmy Anderson to be all out in the final session for 194.</p> <p>It was an upbeat performance from the bowlers, leaving Pietersen purring. If Harmison, generating pace into the early 90 miles per hour and gaining awkward lift from a pitch with a little more matted grass than usual, deserved better than his two wickets from successive deliveries and Stuart Broad fewer than his two, then there was a nice team feel to it. Searching for someone other than himself to lead the side from the field, Pietersen opted to send all of them ahead, with self-congratulations all round.</p> <p>It did, however, leave England a testing hour and a quarter to negotiate to the close, and they lost Andrew Strauss for six, fencing at a ball from Makhaya Ntini that angled across him and edging to first slip. But by the close Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, both playing with great confidence, had taken the score to 49 with the best batting of the day.</p> <p>For a man under the microscope Pietersen, his every move noted and analysed, had a profitable day, doing all the captainy things he might have imagined himself doing. Bowling changes appeared to work, field placings were thoughtful without being over-elaborate and to some extent he appeared to give his bowlers free rein to set their own. He even abandoned the team huddle. Unquestionably, though, he will have tougher days when decision-making will be harder and less productive. The new broom cleared a few cobwebs away.</p> <p>The return of Harmison was either a triumph of timing or an earlier missed opportunity for in the course of 18 overs yesterday, including a remarkable first over of the match, he gave notice as to why it has been in England's interest to rehabilitate him. At his best, which at times he approached yesterday, bowling first from the Vauxhall end and then the Pavilion, there is none better.</p> <p>There is also the residual effect on the other bowlers to consider. Anderson, sharing the new ball with Harmison, may have been at the wrong end initially, but made his mark later from the Vauxhall end when the ball had been given a conker polish and swung wickedly at times.</p> <p>For Andrew Flintoff it represented a return for his mate, a sufficiently close one to swap a bowling boot on the field when one of his own failed. Greater love and all that. Only Broad suffered, especially at the hands of Hashim Amla who in a brief cameo hit him for five boundaries in 10 deliveries as the young man strained for pace that he does not yet possess and overpitched as a result. But he came back strongly towards the end, collecting his brace of wickets and beating the bat with such monotonous regularity that the breeze generated by Ntini's swishing blade in particular could have been harnessed to power a small town.</p> <p>Did Pietersen go to bed on the eve of the match dreaming of a perfect start? Be careful what you wish for. Between them he and Harmison almost pulled it off, the first ball of the game short of a length and going across the left-handed Graeme Smith, who dabbed at it instinctively and sent it at head height to gully where Cook dropped the chance. It was the start of a feisty over.</p> <p>One delivery careered off the inside edge of Smith's bat and into his groin so fiercely that the television Hotspot looked like a nuclear reactor going critical. The final ball of the over, 10 minutes after the first, careered past the batsman, continuing its climb until it burst over the top of Tim Ambrose's flailing glove to give him the fattest of lips.</p> <p>In fact before Flintoff interjected shortly before lunch to take the first wicket of Neil McKenzie, the opening partnership had survived largely through a mixture of good fortune and tenacity. The afternoon was all England's, though, and it was Harmison who set things rolling with the wicket of the South African captain, caught at long-leg by Anderson as he lost control of a hook, to be followed next ball by a full delivery, timed at 93mph, which ripped through Amla's groping shot and tore out the middle stump. When Anderson, in the next over, bamboozled Jacques Kallis with his inswing variation to have him lbw, three wickets had fallen in two overs and the day been turned on its head.</p> <p>Twice more Anderson was to strike, inducing a rare lackadaisical shot from Ashwell Prince who drove tamely to point, and turning Mark Boucher inside out with his sharp away swing, Ambrose completing the catch. When Pietersen brought Monty Panesar on to bowl the habitual last over of the session, and gained the wicket of AB de Villiers as a result, it was clearly intended to be his day.</p>",
  "<p>I read with regularity that if David Miliband - or anyone else - replaces Gordon Brown as prime minister in the coming months, he (or - sorry, Harriet - she) would have to call an early general election to secure a mandate. But would they? And, perhaps more important, should they? I'm not as sure of the case on either count as others seem to be.</p> <p>Historically, prime ministers call elections for one or more of four reasons: first, because they do not have a majority in parliament; second, because they have used up all or most of their five-year mandate; third, because the government faces a disabling crisis that requires resolution; and fourth, because they think this moment represents their best chance of success.</p> <p>How might such a checklist look to a successor taking office this autumn and contemplating pressure for an early poll? First, even after Glasgow East, the government would still have a majority of 63. Second, there would still be a year and a half of the parliament to run - time to carry a full programme through its legislative stages. Third, the government would not be crippled over any defining subject. And, fourth, if the polls are any kind of guide, Labour would be facing electoral oblivion.</p> <p>So I can see very clearly why it is in the interests of the opposition parties to want Miliband (or whoever) to call an instant election and be wiped out. And I can see why the hurry-up culture of the 24/7 media and blogosphere might want the adrenaline rush of an election rather than a renewed phase of government. What is not nearly so obvious is why a new prime minister should oblige them - not least when all the economic factors suggest it is in Labour's interest to hold on as long as possible.</p> <p>Look also at the precedents, though precedent is not everything. Since 1900, Britain has had 25 changes of prime minister. Of these, only 10 have taken place as a result of general elections. The majority, 15 of them, have occurred in the midst of parliamentary terms - including, of course, Brown's own replacement of Tony Blair in 2007. </p> <p>So if Brown is in turn replaced later this year - and I am not saying that he will be, though I think that he should be - these figures will rise to 26 and 16 respectively. Midterm changes of prime minister, in other words, are not merely not unknown; they are more common than changes at elections. They are part of how we do things.</p> <p>Ah, you may say, but new prime ministers nevertheless have an obligation to call a general election soon after taking office, so that they can win a democratic endorsement. Not true. Only three of the 15 \"unelected\" new prime ministers have followed that course, and two of these - Henry Campbell-Bannerman in 1905-6 and Andrew Bonar Law in 1922 - did so after taking over from governments of another stripe. Anthony Eden, replacing Winston Churchill in 1955, is the sole modern example of a new leader calling an immediate election after succeeding a prime minister of his own party.</p> <p>The 1955 example is worth looking at, not least because it does not seem to have occurred to Eden that he had any kind of moral obligation - of the sort that floats in and out of many discussions on this subject today - to go to the country. Quite the reverse. \"His instinct is for going on, as the bolder and more honourable course,\" [my italics] wrote Harold Macmillan in his diary after a private conversation with Eden on April 3 1955. \"What AE would like to do wd be to go to the broadcast and the TV and announce 'No election this year'.\"</p> <p>Going early, by contrast, was felt by Eden to be partisan and opportunistic. Yet this was precisely what Eden decided to do, only four days after the conversation with Macmillan, and supported by all but one of his new cabinet. A general election was called, not because there was any obligation to hold one but because the Tories thought they would win it. They were right. They did.</p> <p>There would be one significantly different circumstance if Brown is replaced. Only once since 1900 has there been a double change of prime minister during one parliament. That was when Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain in 1940, three years after Chamberlain had succeeded Stanley Baldwin, who had led the Conservatives to victory in 1935. But that was under the exceptional conditions of wartime. So a second change of Labour leader since 2005 would be without peacetime precedent.</p> <p>What, nevertheless, would be altered by such a double replacement? Constitutionally, the answer is that there would be no change at all. By changing its leader again Labour would be doing something novel, but that new prime minister would have the same right to behave like any other prime minister. He too could call an immediate election or alternatively say: \"No election this year.\"</p> <p>That choice, though, would be wholly political. That is not to say that a new Labour PM could ignore the risk from a double change. Pressure for an early election would not be confined to those who stood to benefit from it. Public unease would have to be answered. But the argument is not as open and shut as some people now pretend. The public has never liked early elections, and an early election will always be treated as a sign of demise. Going early might make things worse for the new leader.</p> <p>To get through the inevitable barrage of calls for an early poll, any new leader would have to do several things. He would have to acknowledge the concern, but at the same time point out that self interest, not the public interest, was at work in some of them. He would have to insist on having time to begin making necessary changes and that fair play required that the public have a reasonable chance to judge him. He would have to stress that there was important work to do internationally and that the public interest preferred stability. He would have to defend the current system as being the right parliamentary way of doing things. Above all, he must not lightly give up the card that gives him discretion over election timing.</p> <p>Certainly it may not work. But if you accept - which it is clear the angry, the disillusioned, the supercilious and the merely hostile do not - that Labour is entitled to defend and where possible advance its own collective self-interest within the rules of the political system, then it follows that Labour is entitled to change its leader again and then to stay on until a time of its own choosing, not that of its enemies. It may even be the more honourable course as well as the more politically advantageous one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England's freezing of rates yesterday was not surprising - but it was mistaken. The City anticipated the Bank's inaction, as did almost all financial pundits. Everywhere there is evidence that slowdown is giving way to slump. Yet the conventional wisdom - and the majority view in the Bank - is that upward pressure on prices has squeezed out all room for expansionary manoeuvre. </p> <p>That orthodox view, endorsed by the International Monetary Fund in a gloomy report on the UK economy on Wednesday, is understandable enough given that the Bank's overriding formal duty is to keep consumer price inflation (CPI) at 2%. In June the figure stood instead at 3.8% - a 10-year high, and nearly double the target rate. The big worry is that cutting rates against this background might look like a declaration of indifference. No one enjoys being seen to have given up on their job, but the Bank's hawks are not primarily concerned with their own reputation. Rather, they are bewitched by the theory that - with inflation - perception determines reality. Even a fleeting appearance of going soft, they fear, would amount to dangerous appeasement. It would encourage workers to expect more inflation and so they would demand higher pay, setting in train a potentially uncontrollable whirlwind of rising costs and prices. </p> <p>The IMF warned of the grave dangers of allowing the \"inflation anchor ... [to lose] its moorings\", citing survey evidence to suggest that inflationary expectations have already risen. And so they have. Counter to the theory, however, there is no sign at all of these expectations translating into wage claims. Indeed, last month's earnings figures suggested average pay growing at a sustainable rate - and one which, if anything, is slowing. Powerful unions might have been able to translate expected inflation into higher pay - but today's workers overwhelmingly cannot. Current inflation was not sparked by wage bargaining, but by rising commodity prices - most particularly fuel and food. And oil has now fallen back by a fifth from its peak of a few weeks ago. </p> <p>Inflation may go up before it comes down, but - barring a renewed surge in commodities - come down it inevitably will. All economic compasses are now pointing south. With housing, for instance, the Nationwide this week reported prices plunging at their fastest for 17 years. In the high street, the nosedive in spending recorded for June was, by contrast, the largest for 22 years. Even manufacturing, which was supposed to be a bright spot, last week reported the weakest order books in a decade. The Bank now needs to start placing more weight on these grim realities - and rather less on theories about perception.</p>",
  "<p>The air was muggy, and a haze hung over Beijing as if it was yet to wake up, although it was midday. I had decided months before that I would be there for the opening ceremony of the Olympics, and share the excitement. But as I drove in from the airport there were no welcome banners, no colourful flags on the lampposts, no billboards or Olympic posters. It was only three weeks till the big day, after seven years of waiting and meticulous preparations. It was to be the \"dream of a century\" for the Chinese. But the atmosphere was dead. </p> <p>The fast lane of the airport expressway and all the ring roads were marked with the five circles of the Olympic symbol. No cars dared to enter them. The traffic moved unusually freely, as half the city's 3.2m cars have been taken off the road to reduce congestion and help clean up the air. There were few foreign tourists either; the air hostess told me on the way over that Air China flights were being cut back as visas had been drastically restricted to keep out potential troublemakers. I got home in record time.</p> <p>I was startled to see a police car parked outside my apartment complex, and two volunteers in blue and white torch-bearer T-shirts standing at the crossroads. The porter was in military khaki. Instead of greeting me as he usually did, he demanded proof of my residence. I asked him the reason for this change: \"Don't you feel safer?\" he asked. </p> <p>Later I popped out to get the local papers and magazines, and they were full of alarm, bombs in Kunming, suspicious white powder on a plane, anti-aircraft missiles being installed by the Bird's Nest stadium ready for any attack. There were to be security checks on the Beijing underground, and checkpoints at frequent intervals on the highways into the city. \"Even if they dare to commit any crime during the Olympics, they won't be able to escape easily,\" the Beijing Evening News said. Where was the joy, the sense of celebration?</p> <p>I had last been here in early March, just before the demonstrations in Tibet and the violence at the torch relay around the world. The mood was boisterous then, with eager anticipation as the giant clock ticked away on Tiananmen Square counting down to the start. \"Give us 16 days of Olympics, and be rewarded with 5,000 years of our civilisation,\" was a slogan I remembered well. The only questions were: would the stadium and various other sites be finished on time, what about the traffic jams, how could the visitors be made to feel at home, would Chinese athletes collect more golds than America? Above all, how could our Olympic games become the most successful, the most memorable in history?</p> <p>Now the Olympics are here, but the buzz has gone. The only tangible reminder of it has been the torch relay inside China, in which the rest of the world was scarcely interested. Even that was highly staged, with a very visible police and security presence. The commentators on China Central Television even told their audiences to sit at home and watch it on television. A subdued nervousness permeates Beijing.</p> <p>Critics say the Chinese government is exaggerating the terror risk to extend its control. But is it really necessary to have this high security, I asked a Chinese friend, who is not very patriotic. \"Yes,\" she said. \"It is all the foreign devils. Better to have a safe games than a farce like the torch relays in London, Paris, and San Francisco. It was such a loss of face. We don't want it here on our soil.\" </p> <p>For the government too, the risk seems real. They started with \"One World, One Dream\": they believed that China would be welcomed on to the world stage and galvanised frenetic popular support. When the western media protested at the award of the Olympics to China, the government felt it would overcome its critics by dazzling the world with its brilliant display. They failed to appreciate the importance the world would attach to the pledges they had given on the environment, human rights and press freedom. Surely diplomacy means engaging with the world on the world's terms, not just on your terms? </p> <p>Then the protests against the torch relay produced a sea change. Fear of disruption, or worse, hostage-taking and killings like Munich in 1972, took over. The government's new line was only confirmed when 16 policemen were killed in an attack in Xinjiang, in western China, on Monday, just four days before the opening ceremony. A government spokesman said the attackers wanted to \"make 2008 a year of mourning for China\". Now a headline in the Beijing Evening News said it all: \"A safe Olympics is the most important gold medal.\" At any cost, even the jubilation of the whole country. </p> <p>I came back to England. If watching the Olympics on television is now the choice of the Chinese, I thought I would rather do it in London. But then I was overwhelmed by the avalanche of criticism in the British press and TV coverage: \"'Police-state wastes goodwill', says stadium designer\"; \"Beijing Olympics: the spying games\", \"Clegg urges PM: don't endorse these tainted Olympics\", \"Queasy rider - US cyclists combat pollution\", \"Britons arrested for flying pro-Tibet banners\", \"Tiananmen orchestra cannot drown out the chorus of protests\" - and many, many more, ranging from abhorring the \"hideous\" Bird's Nest, to accusations of exploiting the migrant workers who built it. This is not fact-finding but fault-finding. And now, at the eleventh hour, Bush has rasped at China's record on human rights and religious freedom, fanning the flames. </p> <p>China certainly has faults. But reading the papers and watching the news, you might think the country has nothing to take credit for. Do a billion Chinese not deserve their day in the limelight, their moment of rejoicing? The western press seems to equate the Olympics with the Chinese government, not the people - and the people must wonder what they have to do to win some approval.</p> <p>As a Chinese writer and film-maker, I have tried to tell the truth about China - most recently spending a year in Tibet, documenting the lives of ordinary Tibetans, their dreams and their frustrations. I know the problems all too well. But as the writer VS Pritchett once said, the only worthwhile criticism is \"lit with a gleam of sympathy\". The reforms that have produced China's vibrant cities, its new prosperity and new freedoms, only started 30 years ago in 1978. We still have a long way to go. But covering China with nothing but shame is not going to help us get there. As we Chinese say, you don't make a seedling grow faster by pulling it up and stretching it. </p> <p>We can expect more demonstrations in Beijing during the games, especially with the kind of encouragement given by the western press. The Chinese government would do well not to overreact to the protests or the criticism, with 25,000 foreign journalists focusing on them. They should be confident in the knowledge that the majority of the Chinese are behind them, at least on the games. I'm sure it will be a great and memorable - and safe - spectacle. I will be watching it, and so will half the world. But I shall be wishing that my countrymen and women were dancing in the streets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Sun Shuyun is the author of A Year in Tibet, and directed the BBC4 series of the same title <br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When a victorious Boris Johnson stepped up to the podium on May 3 London did not know what to expect from its new mayor. The man best known as the gaffe-prone host of television's Have I Got News for You had defeated Ken Livingstone, one of the most successful politicians in London's history. But after a short pause, the Old Etonian with one of the biggest personal mandates in Europe struck a conciliatory note.</p> <p>\"I do not for one minute believe that this election shows London has been transformed overnight into a Conservative city. But I do hope it does show that the Conservatives have changed into a party that can again be trusted after 30 years with the greatest, most cosmopolitan, multiracial generous-hearted city on earth.\"</p> <p>As the administration's first 100 days draw to a close there are signs that Johnson is becoming more confident that the mayoralty will provide the blueprint for the next Conservative government - and perhaps a launchpad for his own cabinet ambitions. \"If the Conservatives are going to be coming into power next time around, then let's share ideas and let's work something up together,\" he said this week.</p> <h2>Unpredictable</h2> <p>But London watchers say it is too early to know what this administration will mean for London or the Conservative party. \"Unpredictable is a good description of the administration at the moment,\" said Tony Travers, head of the London group at the London School of Economics. \"There is a sense that anything could happen.\" </p> <p>Conservative central office is also in \"wait-and-see mode\", according to one Tory. \"I think that Cameron is keeping a very close eye on what Boris is up to but he is also not getting too close. I think that if it all goes well he will claim it as an example of modern Conservatism and if it goes badly it will be portrayed as Boris being Boris.\"</p> <p>Johnson has been buffeted by two resignations, banned alcohol on tubes and buses and pledged to rein in the \"waste and bureaucracy\" of the previous mayoralty. But supporters and opponents accept there has been a lack of administration-defining announcements. \"I would probably give him five out of 10,\" said one official. \"We don't quite know what he is about yet and it can sometimes be a bit chaotic but most people are just watching and waiting to see what happens.\"</p> <p>There are plenty of Livingstone supporters at City Hall willing him to fail. But even among those who have been brought in by Johnson there are doubts about the mayor's grip on the finer details of the job. \"The thing with Johnson is that he is bright enough to pick up anything but I think his attention span is pretty short and to be honest the detail bores him,\" says one senior figure. </p> <p>Others talk of low-level chaos and drift at City Hall. Some fear he will struggle to control his deputies. \"It is not enough to be seriously damaging yet but it is very different to how it was under Ken where everyone knew straight away what the line would be and knew they had to stick to it,\" said one observer.</p> <p>Johnson, however, has settled into a routine. He leaves the Islington home he shares with his wife and young family after breakfast and cycles the few miles to City Hall arriving between 8.30am and 9am. He arrives at his eighth floor office where he holds a \"strategy meeting\" with his inner circle - including chief of staff Tim Parker and head of communications Guto Harri.</p> <p>According to those who work alongside him Johnson in private is the same \"affable toff\" known to television audiences. He never shouts or loses his temper. \"What you see is absolutely what you get with Boris,\" said former Tory mayoral candidate Steve Norris, who is now part of the Johnson regime. \"He is often in the canteen wandering around with his tray and a banana, chatting to whoever he comes across. His warmth is genuine and quite irresistible.\"</p> <p>But Johnson's charm has led to difficulties . One official says Johnson keeps meeting people at parties and \"with little more than a slap on the back and a proclamation that 'Cripes, we could really use someone like you', offers them a job.\" Opponents argue this informal appointments process has led to a purge of women and ethnic minorities from the top jobs. </p> <p>Another side to his character emerged last month when Ray Lewis, deputy mayor for young people, was forced to resign after accusations of financial misconduct and inappropriate behaviour.</p> <p>\"The weekend of the Ray Lewis resignation he was punch drunk with it all,\" said one well-placed source. \"He appeared befuddled and bemused, like an older boy who had been happily playing with children in a country house and then something had gone wrong and he just deflated. He seemed confused and a bit sad.\"</p> <p>The affair raised questions about his judgment and led to accusations that his management team had mishandled each stage, from his deputy's appointment to his final press conference. But Travers argues the episode did not do Johnson any harm. \"The over-riding impression is of Johnson standing by his black deputy, which helps to negate accusations of racism that were made during the campaign.\" </p> <h2>Platitudes</h2> <p>Johnson's supporters say his priorities were clear during the election campaign and have been reiterated since May 1. He wants to \"tackle crime, deliver value for money and improve the quality of life for all Londoners\". Opponents describe these as \"political platitudes\" and compare Johnson to child with a new toy he does not know what to do with.</p> <p>\"We really don't know which Boris we are dealing with yet,\" said Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London assembly. \"Is it the Telegraph columnist with strange views on race, Boris the One Nation Tory, or Boris who cried when Margaret Thatcher resigned?\"</p> <p>Scrutiny of Johnson's election pledges remains difficult as the first three months have been taken up with appointing a team and dealing with the resignations of Lewis and James McGrath, who stepped down after saying of elderly Caribbean Londoners: \"Let them go if they don't like it here.\"</p> <p>But opponents say it is clear Johnson is overseeing a return to small government and cost-cutting, pointing to the findings of his Forensic Audit Commission, which called for more power to be handed to the boroughs.</p> <p>Norris accepts Johnson is in favour of small government and \"core Conservative values\" but insists these will help bring prosperity to the capital.</p> <p>\"The truth is that the first 100 days is really the transition period and he has done more or less exactly what I would want to have done. Ken Livingstone, quite understandably, created the Greater London authority in his own image and that means that there is a lot of work to do before we start to get a clear impression of what this administration is really about .\"</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>May</strong></p> <p><strong>3 </strong>Boris Johnson makes victory speech </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Appoints Ray Lewis, pictured below, deputy for young people</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Announces \"booze ban\" on public transport </p> <p><strong>8 </strong>Appoints \"independent\" Forensic Audit Panel to review GLA Group spending.

  "<p>Andy Green has the aura of a man given a new lease of life. Last year he was preparing to quit BT after more than 20 years, to spend more time doing charity work, but now he's back running one of the biggest names in British IT.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336326322\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/08/07/andy220.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Green\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Green, chief executive of Logica. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Logica has gone through a torrid time since its forceful chief executive, Martin Read, who built the company into a major European player during his tenure, was ousted last year by irate shareholders following a spectacular profit warning.</p> <p>At the time, Green, whose short-sleeved shirt he sports in his interview cries out for a techie-style row of pens in the breast pocket, was settling down for his 22nd year at BT before cashing in and working for charities including Shelter.</p> <p>Having been allowed to take BT's ragbag of international assets and spend six years building them into a multibillion-pound international IT business, now called BT Global Services, the 52-year-old had taken a non-operational job as CEO of group strategy and operations as his swansong.</p> <p>The media painted Green as locked in a race with Ian Livingston for the top job at BT in the event of Ben Verwaayen's departure. Green, however, had his own exit strategy. The only problem was, it turned out to be a really bad idea.</p> <p>\"If you examined the BT report and accounts you would have seen that my [share options] packages ... were due to come to fruition all at once in 2009. I had concluded I was going to go and do some charity work and some non-executive things ... but three months into my new role, I realised I hated it and I really wanted to be an operating chief executive, which was a bit unfortunate,\" he chuckles.</p> <p>His fortunes changed when Logica approached him to rescue its shattered reputation with investors, with the incentive of a \u00a33.5m golden hello. He joined in January and in April unveiled his turnaround plan for the business. His idea is to improve the company's sales operation, double its offshore workforce and cut costs, including 1,300 jobs. From next year - which will mark Logica's 40th anniversary - it is supposed to result in market-beating revenue growth, sector-leading margins and thus higher dividends.<br><strong><br>Rocket science</strong></p> <p>Since April, Green has been taking \"The Logica Story\" - a 24-point distillation of the original 82-page presentation made to the City - to the firm's 39,000 employees. The plan itself is hardly rocket science, but the really difficult job will be changing the culture within the company, hence his going around like a door-to-door salesman with his pitch. Green, who grew up in Dorridge in the West Midlands, talks with candour - he booted his PR minder out of the interview, something that few senior businessmen would do these days - and it's a candour that he now needs from the employees he meets.</p> <p>Logica got into trouble last year because its UK business fell off a cliff when a key contract went awry. \"The centre was off buying businesses and they were relying on the margins from the UK to justify the whole thing and there was a lot of pressure in the organisation not to hear bad news,\" he says. </p> <p>Many in the City reckon Read was too domineering. Green demurs: \"Martin has many strengths strategically but I think there was a group of people who just thought: it's too hard to tell Martin this.\"</p> <p>Green has already taken one obvious step towards changing the culture of the company: dumping its long-held and rather moth-eaten London headquarters in favour of a new building in Reading. He has also dropped the CMG suffix from the company's name, a relic of its merger with its Dutch rival CMG in 2002. </p> <p>While the financial fruits of Green's labours will not appear until next year, half-year figures next Thursday should give a sign things are heading in the right direction. </p> <p>\"What we should be able to show in the figures are the milestones: have we built up more people offshore? How have orders been getting on? Have we recruited the people we said we would recruit in our high-growth areas? Do we have the sales people? Shareholders are interested ... mainly because they are looking for a company that says 'we are going to do this' and actually does it.\"</p> <p>His credibility was boosted last month when Logica won a slice of a lucrative contract with the French tyre-maker Michelin, rumoured to be worth \u20ac300m (\u00a3237m) over three years, but investors will be looking for reassurance that the downturn in Europe, where Logica makes 95% of its revenues, has not stalled progress. Results last month from its rivals CapGemini and Atos Origin were strong but suggested weakness in the UK market.</p> <p>Green shows little concern that clients may stop hiring his people. \"As companies face threats, they are increasingly turning to IT solutions to resolve their issues,\" he says. His ambition is to raise the size of Logica's average contract - about \u20ac10m a year - to more like \u20ac50m. So will the firm soon be snapping at the heels of BT? Possibly, but he says: \"I don't expect us to be directly competitive at least for another five years.\"</p> <p>If he succeeds it would be ironic, not least because he never thought he'd get to run BT Global Services at all. He was strategy director under the chief executive Peter Bonfield and chairman Sir Ian Vallance, who presided over a mammoth expansion plan that left the firm with such crippling debts that when the dotcom bubble burst both men got the boot. BT had to launch a \u00a36bn rescue rights issue and hand its mobile phone business - then called Cellnet but since rebranded as O2 - to shareholders for nothing.</p> <p>Green partly owes his survival to the fact that when boom turned to bust he was running BT's internet service provider business, BT Openworld. But he admits he thought he was for the chop when he went to Vallance's successor, Sir Christopher Bland, with his plan to turn the businesses he had bought into an IT services operation. \"It was a real mess and I went to pitch to Bland, assuming I was about to get shot and I think Christopher took me on assuming he was going to shoot me,\" Green remembers. He didn't and in the last three months the business Green created accounted for almost 40% of BT's total revenues of \u00a35.2bn. In contrast, analysts estimate Logica's half year revenues will be about \u00a31.67bn.</p> <p><strong>Buying bricks </strong></p> <p>Despite his new role at Logica, Green still has time for charity work. He is spending part of his summer holiday working with Abesu, a charity he helped found with his brother-in-law after his sister died from cancer in 2005. She had met a woman called Queenie while visiting a niece working for Oxfam in Africa, who was using any spare cash to buy bricks to build a home for her grandchildren. Green's sister always talked of starting a charity to help. With a local women's cooperative, Abesu has built 10 houses in the past year and installed vital infrastructure such as wells in rural Zambia.</p> <p>Green is also a fundraiser for Shelter, among whose trustees is Martin Read. He has been a supporter of the housing charity since he was at Leeds University, for which he dumped a place at Cambridge because its chemical engineering course was a year shorter and he was keen to get into business.</p> <p>\"I'm never quite sure how life would be different if I'd chosen differently,\" he says. \"There are so many accidents in life when you look back at it but I am glad it has turned out the way it has.\"</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> September 7 1955</p> <p><strong>Education </strong>King Edward's School, Edgbaston, Birmingham; Leeds University (BSc chemical engineering, first class hons)</p> <p><strong>Career</strong><br><strong>1976-82</strong> Shell, sales representative<br><strong>1982-84</strong> Shell, product manager<br><strong>1984-86</strong> Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, marketing consultant<br><strong>1986-87</strong> BT, manager IT marketing<br><strong>1987-88</strong> BT, general manager national payphone services<br><strong>1988-93</strong> BT, general manager then director network services<br><strong>1993-94</strong> BT, general manager customer services, then director UK customer field services<br><strong>1994-2000</strong> BT, group director strategy and development<br><strong>2000-01</strong> BT Openworld, chief executive<br><strong>2001-07</strong> BT Global Services, chief executive<br><strong>2007</strong> BT, chief executive group strategy and operations<br><strong>2008-</strong> Logica, chief executive</p> <p><strong>Family </strong>Married with three children</p>",

  "<p>A hospital at the centre of an infection outbreak which killed nine patients and contributed to the deaths of nine others has been severely criticised by an independent inquiry.</p> <p>The investigation into the Clostridium difficile outbreak at the Vale of Leven hospital in West Dunbartonshire yesterday blamed the hospital for a series of failures in its infection control policies, use of antibiotics, cleanliness and patient isolation facilities. </p> <p>Officially linked to 18 deaths at the hospital, the outbreak between last December and June this year is the worst so far at a Scottish hospital and believed to be one of the worst in the UK. In total, 55 people were infected by the bug, which is primarily spread by poor hygiene and misuse of antibiotics. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish health secretary, said the report painted an \"appalling and unacceptable\" picture. \"There should be no doubt NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde owe the patients and the families concerned an unconditional apology,\" she added. </p> <p>But victims' families accused the Scottish executive of limiting the scope of the inquiry to avoid embarrassing government and senior health service officials. </p> <p>Michelle Stewart, a founding member of the C.diff Justice Group, said the report should have been entirely independent of the NHS. \"This was, in the main, a case of the NHS investigating the NHS,\" she said. David Logan, the group's chairman, said: \"If it had not been for the persistence of the families we are clear that the matter would have been covered up and swept under the carpet. There has been a massive systems failure and we need an open, transparent and independent public inquiry to get answers.\"</p> <p>The inquiry found that some problems stemmed from uncertainty about the hospital's future, leading to cuts in maintenance and investment. Even so, the hospital was poorly equipped and its infection control policies ill-managed.</p>",
  "<p>The mother of a teenager who became the unintended victim of a gang shooting said last night that her son had been killed in a \"cold blooded and reckless act\".</p> <p>In a statement issued by the police, Elfrida Kiffin described Ryan Bravo as \"decent, hard-working young man\", and called on witnesses to come forward to help detectives. \"This is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved Ryan and I would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private,\" she said.</p> <p>His death brings to 22 the number of teenagers to die violently in the capital this year. The 18-year-old was shot in the back by a gang wearing bike helmets shortly after he entered the Costcutter shop in Camberwell Road, in south London, at around 9.40pm on Wednesday. </p> <p>Police said he was an innocent bystander who was shot by mistake after the gang on mopeds pursued two other men who had barged in front of him to get into the shop. The gang then fired through the Costcutter doorway before riding off. </p> <p>\"It was obviously a targeted shooting, but the young man who was shot was not the target,\" said Detective Inspector Tim Carter of Operation Trident, the specialist team that deals with gun crime and which is handling the investigation. </p> <p>Bravo was with a cousin and two brothers, one of whom tried desperately to keep him alive before the ambulance crew arrived. </p> <p>A London Ambulance spokesman said \"extensive efforts\" had been made to resucitate Bravo, but he was pronounced dead at the scene around 45 minutes later. </p> <p>A 19-year-old man, who has not been named, was arrested in Brixton on Wednesday and is being held at a south London police station. </p> <p>DI Carter said: \"As they were going in through the door, two other black males barged past them. At the same time three scooters were travelling along the pavement towards Camberwell Green and a number of shots were fired. The victim was fatally shot in the back as he was going into the store. </p> <p>\"We are looking into the possibility that the two men who attempted to barge past were the intended targets. We don't know who they are and we're appealing for them to come forward.\"</p> <p>Police said the men who pushed into the shop had been running in the same direction as the scooters. They said that those responsible might have been prowling the area looking for their target earlier in the day.</p> <p>One witness who had been buying cigarettes in the shop said he heard up to four shots in less than 10 seconds.</p> <p>He said: \"I didn't think anything bad was going to happen because I thought they were joking and laughing. They didn't look scared or angry or anything. But then I heard shots, three or four. I've never seen anyone get shot before.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the family home yesterday, Bravo's girlfriend, who did not want to be named, said that he was a \"really great guy\", and had being studying business at a local college. He was completely innocent and not a member of any gang, she said. A family friend, also at the house, said: \"He had so much to look forward to. His whole life was ahead of him. It's just really, really sad.\"</p> <p>A neighbour added: \"I didn't ever know him to get into any trouble. My son and him were always talking and laughing together. As my son would say, he was a gentleman - he didn't have any 'street name' or anything like that.</p> <p>\"He was just a normal guy. I've got two sons and I'm just so worried.\"</p> <p>Forensic teams were yesterday studying bullet holes in a telephone box outside the shop. Although several bullets and cases had been recovered, police said they could not confirm how many shots had been fired and were waiting for a ballistics report.</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman tonight said last night that the shooting was not linked to an incident at 4.30pm in which a man was shot in the leg in nearby Kennington.</p> <p>\"There were a number of people in Costcutter at the time, some of whom we have identified. I would appeal to anybody who was there or saw the mopeds coming along the pavement to contact police. </p> <p>\"We do not believe there was any reason why they would want to shoot him,\" he said. \"He is just a young lad who went into a shop with his brothers and cousin and has been hit by a bullet.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives today set out their credentials to become the champions of social equality in a document outlining the education gap between rich and poor, which they claim has widened under the Labour government. </p> <p>The paper, entitled A Failed Generation, says English schoolchildren's chances of getting good Sats results, GCSEs and A-levels is dictated by where they live. </p> <p>About 55% of secondary schools in the 10% most deprived parts of the country are failing to reach the government's floor target of 30% of pupils getting five good GCSEs, including English and maths. In comparison, just 3% of the schools are in the least deprived areas. </p> <p>In three named local authorities - Islington, Darlington and Blackpool - not a single child took GCSE physics in a state school, they say. </p> <p>The schools minister, Jim Knight, dismissed the Conservative figures as \"selective\" presenting an alternative numeric analysis of the achievement gap which showed it narrowing since 1997.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the shadow children's secretary leading the efforts to rebrand the Tories as the party for social equality, said: \"The government's attempts to close the widening gap between rich and poor have failed. These figures highlight yet again that children from less well-off backgrounds do not get the same opportunities as others.</p> <p>\"Education should be the engine of social mobility. But most schools in the poorest areas are officially classed by the government as 'failing' and children eligible for free school meals are nearly 200 times more likely to leave school without a single C at GCSE than they are to get three As at A-level.</p> <p>\"We urgently need to address the widening gap between rich and poor. We want to allow good new schools to set up in poor areas - based on the successful Swedish model - so that every parent gets the opportunity for their child that is currently only open to the rich.\"</p> <p>The research says pupils begin to fall behind in primary school. About 45% of persistent truants are pupils on free school meals despite the fact that they are only 14% of the school population. </p> <p>Nearly seven times as many pupils are excluded in the 10% most deprived primary schools, compared with the 10% least deprived primary schools. </p> <p>The Conservatives' policy is to allow new schools to set up in poor areas based on a Swedish model of academy-style independent but state-funded schools. This would give all children access to a standard of education enjoyed by people who can afford independent schools, they say. It would be funded by a pupil places premium, with schools receiving extra money to teach the poorest pupils, meaning that they are more likely to compete to work in deprived areas rather than avoiding them. Parents would be given control of the education budget for their children but could only use it in the state sector. </p> <p>Ministers have announced a programme of intense support for the 638 schools which last year had fewer than 30% reaching the floor target of five good GCSEs including the basics, in English and maths. But they angered headteachers by insisting schools have only three years to turn round and face closure or being turned into an academy.</p> <p>Knight presented alternative figures showing that the gap between pupils on free school meals and their classmates had narrowed by 2%-4% in English, maths and science sats. At GCSE in 2005 fewer than 30% of pupils on free school meals got five good GCSEs; that figure was now above 35%. </p> <p>\"The Tory claims are not accurate; it is a manipulation of figures. Anyone who works in education knows that as a result of investment - sixfold in real terms in school buildings for example - things have improved most significantly for those who need it. The Tories aren't coming forward with credible policies.\"</p> <p>He said the Swedish model, which encourages parents to set up schools, would not help pupils in the most disadvantaged areas where parents were most likely to be disengaged from education.</p> <p>\"I simply can't see that the Swedish-style free market model is going to make the difference that they say,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The news of the potential impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf means further political instability for Pakistan - at least in the short term.</p> <p>Though a deal has finally been done between the Pakistan People's party (PPP), effectively led by the late Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), this indicates a very temporary coincidence of interest rather than a new solidarity. However, the beleaguered president's decision not to go to China for the opening ceremony of the Olympic games shows he is taking the threat seriously.</p> <p>No Pakistani president has ever been impeached and the procedure laid down in the 1973 constitution is likely to mean a classic drawn-out Pakistani politico-legal wrangle. Impeachment is a political process relying on a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament deciding to remove the president from office on the grounds of gross misconduct, physical or mental impairment or violation of the constitution. Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency last November, shortly after getting himself re-elected for a second five-year term, means the third option is the most likely.</p> <p>But the PPP and the PML-N will need help from smaller groupings - including hardline religious elements and a significant number of the 17 independent parliamentarians - to get the impeachment through the national assembly. Such support is uncertain at best and all assembly members, particularly the independents, are likely to be the subject of frantic horse-trading. </p> <p>Equally, Musharraf still has powerful and wealthy allies such as the loyalists of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q; and an impeachment could also prove to be unpopular at home and overseas. </p> <p>The issues of the restoration of about 60 judges removed from their posts by Musharraf when he declared the emergency last year is directly linked to the impeachment. \"They have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing,\" said Professor Osama Siddique, an expert in constitutional law in Pakistan.</p> <p>A simpler way of ousting Musharraf may simply be to use the threat of the impeachment to force him to opt for a confidence vote. However, given that he is unlikely to win, the president will resist such a move if he can.</p> <p>The west will be watching the evolving relations between the military and Pakistan's political leaders closely. A recent attempt to subject the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service (ISI) to civilian authority backfired badly. Even though Musharraf still has some friends within the sprawling military establishment, few analysts believe the army will intervene.</p> <p>The real winner may eventually be Sharif, a two-time former prime minister who returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabia last year. His PML-N party did well in the spring elections, especially in the key province of the Punjab. He has the vote of much of the religiously conservative, patriotic commercial middle class in Pakistan's rapidly growing cities and has his finger on the popular pulse more than any other politician. And it is Sharif, who detests the president, who has pushed hard for impeachment.</p> <p>Musharraf still has the theoretical constitutional right to dissolve parliament - subject to eventual supreme court approval. This is the political \"smart bomb\" that the president could use to delay his impeachment - but only at the cost of provoking a new election and giving Sharif, whom he ousted in 1999, the chance to consolidate his power. Whatever the result of this latest crisis, it is Sharif who is likely to come out on top.</p>",
  "<p>German politicians have been accused of robbing youngsters of one of the small joys of childhood after announcing plans to ban the Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs, on the grounds that they are a safety hazard.</p> <p>The children's committee of the German parliament, which is responsible for introducing legislation, fears children might mistake the toys contained in the eggs for food and swallow them. Critics have also said that mixing toys and food is not helpful when trying to teach children the value of good nutrition.</p> <p>\"Children can't differentiate between toys and nutritional items,\" said Miriam Gruss, a member of the committee. \"It is a sad fact, but that means that Kinder Surprise eggs have to go.\"</p> <p>Cornflakes and other products that contain toys are also on the blacklist.</p> <p>The company Ferrero, which produces Kinder Surprise eggs for Germany, responded angrily to the announcement, saying its product had undergone many safety tests since first coming on to the German market in 1974. \"There is absolutely no evidence that the Kinder Surprise eggs as a combination of toy and foodstuff are dangerous,\" said Elise Glaab, the company's spokeswoman. \"The Kinder Surprise toy is separated from the chocolate by a plastic capsule.\"</p> <p>Torben Erbrath, spokesman for the Federal Association for the German Confectionery Industry, said: \"We have seen no evidence that the eggs are dangerous.\"</p> <p>The committee did not provide any statistics to back up safety fears.</p> <p>The egg - known in Germany as \u00dcberraschungs Ei or \u00dc-Ei - contains a yellow capsule housing a small toy and is loved by children across Europe, but nowhere more so than in Germany.</p> <p>Bild newspaper said the ruling would \"come as a shock to millions of children\" and yesterday collectors of the Kinder Surprise toys found in the eggs rallied on websites. On the most prominent Kinder Surprise collectors' forum, Eierlei.de, bloggers accused the government of \"beheading\" their favourite sweet.</p> <p>\"Sonnenschein\" accused the parliament of \"stealing our last little joy - with no reasonable explanation\".</p> <p>One respondent said it was hard to consider the capsules dangerous because they were \"as much of a mouthful\" as the lengthy name by which the confectionary trade refers to the egg: Schockoladespielzeugkombinationseier (chocolate toy combination eggs).</p> <p>On the website of the newspaper Die Welt, 97% of respondents to the question: \"Do you think the combination of sweets and food is dangerous?\" replied that it was \"nonsense\".</p> <p>The same committee meeting proposed a law requiring the paper in school books to be lighter to reduce the health risk of heavy schoolbags.</p> <h2>Inside stories</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kinder Surprise eggs were invented in Italy in 1972. Kinder means \"children\" in German.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The eggs contain novelty figures or models requiring assembly. Every year 20 new figures and jigsaws and 150 assembly kits are introduced.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Collectors are known to shake the eggs before buying to try to determine what is inside.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The internet brought the introduction of \"magicodes\", slips of paper in the eggs which gives access to games to be downloaded on the manufacturer's website.</p>",
  "<p>At 7.11pm on an autumn evening five years ago, Julia Pemberton dialled 999. She explained to the call handler that she was hiding in the store room from her estranged husband Alan, who was breaking into her home brandishing a loaded gun. She had already heard him discharge the weapon. What she did not realise was that he had killed her 17-year-old son, William. </p> <p>The operator instructed her to remain hidden, assuring her that officers were on their way. Yet, at 7.17pm, the police log recorded \"no units to attend ATT [at this time]\". Julia stayed on the line for a further 10 minutes, begging for help: \"He's coming through the door - oh God. I've got about one minute before I die - please get to me.\" At 7.27pm the operator noted the sound of a door opening, and a scream. The line then went dead. </p> <p>Next month, a homicide review panel is due to report on its investigation into the deaths of Julia and William. There could be no murder trial because, after shooting his wife and son, Alan Pemberton turned the gun on himself. This kind of inquiry, which holds local agencies to account over domestic killings, was developed in the 70s, following the infamous case of Maria Colwell, the seven-year-old brutally murdered by her stepfather in Brighton in 1973. But it has only recently been extended to include adult fatalities. </p> <p>The Pemberton review will be significant not only in what it concludes about police failings but because it could set the bar for future investigations. </p> <p>The months before the Pemberton shootings tell a story of abject system failure. After years of abuse, Julia broached the subject of divorce with her husband. He responded that he'd rather kill her. But when she went to the police, they had no domestic violence policy in place, did not undertake any risk assessment and failed to respond adequately to Julia's increasingly desperate pleas. When her locks were glued up and further death threats posted through her door, the police did not act, despite the fact that Alan was already subject to an injunction with power of arrest. On the day of the shooting, armed officers were ordered to hold back for fear of injury. It was nearly seven hours before they entered the house to discover the bodies.</p> <p>These are only some of the deficiencies that Julia's surviving family hope will be addressed next month. But the trouble is that homicide reviews are flawed in their inception. The domestic violence charity Refuge has already expressed concern that both the process and the findings are confidential, which offers too much opportunity for cover-up and precludes external scrutiny. The chair of the committee is not required to be independent. And staff involved in cases are often not informed of the outcome, while local authorities seldom act on the institutional failures revealed.</p> <p>In the arena of domestic violence prevention, homicide review can easily seem like fiddling after the fact. They are expensive, and undertaken in a minority of cases. Still, two women each week die at the hands of their partner or ex-partner in this country, many as much victims of a postcode lottery that dictates how seriously injunctions or threats to kill are taken by the police as they are victims of violent men. But more shocking than this statistic is the knowledge that so many of these deaths are preventable. </p> <p>Unusually, the Pemberton panel has considered hours of evidence from family members, whose views are not generally solicited, though they will likely have better knowledge of a victim's circumstances than any other party.</p> <p>Julia's brother, Frank Mullane, has been challenged about the public cost of such inquiries. But, as he sees it, these reviews could yield benefits beyond preventing deaths. \"Done with honesty and genuine commitment, there must be a chance that they will raise the consciousness of those involved in protecting the public,\" he says. \"Beyond that, the review might drive innovation in the services offered so that more people in need make contact in the first place, including perpetrators. And it might contribute to greater community involvement and give impetus to education of youngsters about warning signs and how to have healthy relationships.\" </p> <p>Around the same time as the Pemberton results are due, the government will release its guidelines on how future domestic homicide reviews should be handled. Those involved in drafting the guidelines would be wise to examine the template that the investigation into the murders of Julia and Williams provides. Only then will these reviews become more than chronicles of deaths foretold, and provide a mandate for change. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Pemberton family can be contacted at Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse <br><a href=\"mailto:info@aafda.org.uk\">info@aafda.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It was in January last year that a police officer came to my house in Northamptonshire to warn me that I was in danger of having my shotgun licence revoked. This was because I had rashly written that I was so fed up with burglars that I intended to arm myself and lie in wait like Tony Martin for the next intruder.</p> <p>I wrote this in G2 knowing full well, as Tony Martin had already discovered to his cost, that one isn't allowed to go around shooting burglars, and I told the officer that I hadn't meant to be taken seriously. He said he had assumed as much, but that his superiors in the Northamptonshire police were not amused and would probably be writing to me. In the event they never did so, and my shotgun is still safely locked up in its metal cupboard, from which - following the conviction this week of five members of the Johnson gang - I have lost all temptation to remove it. For I feel much safer now that the Johnsons are not around.</p> <p>It now seems more than likely that it was the Johnsons who were responsible for two break-ins at my Uncle Robin's house during which most things of any value were removed. That was what the police suspected at the time, and the burglaries certainly had all the hallmarks of a Johnson operation. They had been carefully planned and audaciously carried out.</p> <p>The burglars must have known that Robin was away wintering in Thailand at the time and that the Inigo Jones pavilion in which he lives would be unoccupied during the Christmas and New Year holidays. It is also the sort of building the Johnsons like to rob - an architectural gem suggesting snootiness and privilege.</p> <p>Ricky Johnson, 54, the father of the gang, once said in a BBC documentary that \"I feel I have got the fucking right to rob the lords out there\", and while Robin is far from being a lord (he bought Stoke Park for \u00a33,500 in 1954), he might well have been seen by the Johnsons as belonging to that hated category.</p> <p>Anyway, whoever they were, the robbers roared across open parkland in 4x4s, scaled a stone balustrade, smashed a basement window, and ransacked every drawer and cupboard in the house before making off with most of the furniture, silver and china. This happened three days before Christmas; and living as I do across the lawn from Robin's house and being in charge of it at the time, I had his basement window boarded up the next day - only for the robbers to return a week later and break in again, taking whatever stuff they had missed first time around.</p> <p>This was more than a little disheartening, and may have been partly responsible for Uncle Robin's subsequent decision (about which I wrote the other day, giving his age wrongly as 88 instead of 86) to settle in Thailand more or less permanently. It must be hard for him to feel the same about a house that has been so comprehensively defiled.</p> <p>Apart from saying unofficially that they thought it was the Johnsons who had done it, the police didn't appear to hold out any hope of catching the burglars and soon wrote to me saying the crimes were \"unresolved\" and that they were closing their investigation.</p> <p>This led me to write some harsh words about the uselessness of the police and their preference for form filling and \"victim support\" over the more difficult task of actually catching criminals, but little did I then know that five police forces were at that time secretly working together to bring the Johnsons to justice. I am happy now to eat my words.</p> <p>It is, of course, possible that it wasn't the Johnsons but some other gang that ransacked Stoke Park; and the place is not officially listed among the houses they robbed during their 20-year career. But I would be astonished if it turned out not to have been them. Even if the robberies were not as spectacular as the ones at Waddesdon, the Rothschild house (in whose park the Johnsons hid overnight in a camouflaged truck before brazenly driving out with their loot next day), and at Ramsbury Manor, Harry Hyams' home (a window of which they rammed with metal rods attached to the front of a Subaru), they had something of the same dash and ferocity. And whoever robbed Stoke Park was also \"forensically aware\", as the judge put it, for they left no fingerprints or other signs of their visit.</p> <p>It seems likely that the Johnsons carried out many more robberies than have so far been attributed to them, for robbery was their passion. More than for the vast rewards it brought them, they loved it for its own sake, and any day spent without planning or committing a break-in must have seemed an empty one. From their pictures they looked like the kind of staged villains that the British treasure so much - arrogant, ruthless, repulsive, and thoroughly committed and professional. And to protect themselves against the risk of ever feeling any compunction for the havoc and misery they have caused, they claim virtue in a mission to fleece \"the lords out there\". But the most striking thing about the Johnsons is the amount of fear and anxiety just one little gang can cause. They managed to give the impression that the English countryside was swarming with robbers and that no country house was safe.</p> <p>Now that they are behind bars, everyone will calm down and realise that England is not quite such a crime-infested country as they thought and I, for one, will certainly sleep easier at night.</p> <p><strong>This week Alexander visited</strong> the marvellous cathedral at Orvieto, in Umbria, Italy: \"More splendid than such a small city could justify, it is a testament to the ambition of its medieval citizens - an ambition a bit like wanting to host the Olympics today.\"</p>",
  "<p> Lurching wildly from must-have PS3 games to animal fighting duos, this week's Chatterbox staggered toward the taste barrier, took a quick peek, then belly flopped over. If it all got too much for you, here's a carefully edited replay... </p> <p>We start with Friday. Race Driver GRID comes up for discussion with several 'box regular's defending its easy sling-about handling. \"It's the sort of game you could only dream of when a kid.

Newcomer Smiffington pops up to ask whether there are any must-have buys on PS3. General consensus? The likes of MGS, COD4, Uncharted, GTAIV and Warhawk are as close as you'll get.</p> <p>The Pes 2009 trailer appears to a ripple of interest (though not as much as the Barry George acquittal), but the afternoon drifts out on some useful best man speech advice (use visual aids, do a CV of the groom, keep it short...).</p> <p>A couple of keen readers sneak in on Saturday, with Roarrr raising a valid point about the PlayStation Store, \"Watched some more GTR R35 clips... if you log in via US PSN the clips are free but you cannot watch unless you have us wallet, but in EU they are 69p??

It is understood that he is not prepared to pay a premium for the firm. </p> <p>The entrepreneur owns two garden centre chains, Wyevale and Blooms, but had to concede defeat in May in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/22/tesco.supermarkets\">battle with Tesco</a> for control of the Dobbies garden centre business. </p> <p>A week ago, Flying Brands reported a sharp fall in its first-half profits to \u00a31.2m from \u00a32.7m, with sales down 5% at \u00a318.9m, and the company scrapped its half-year dividend. </p> <p>It also shut its Greetings Direct business, which it acquired in 2006, after an \"extremely disappointing\" trial of the loss-making greeting cards business in the US. The company is taking a \u00a31.7m hit from the closure and losses, and has warned this would cut profits by \u00a31.5m this year. </p> <p>Like many CD and DVD retailers with offshore operations, Flying Brands benefits from a VAT exemption on goods priced below \u00a318 that are imported by individuals into the UK from outside the EU. It is known as \"low value consignment relief\". </p> <p>The firm's Flying Flowers business buys flowers from Kenya, South Africa, Colombia and the Netherlands, sells them online and delivers them to people's homes in styroform boxes designed to keep the flowers fresh. </p> <p>It is the largest flowers-by-post brand in the UK \u2013 despatching nearly 1m bouquets a year - but has been hit in the past by postal strikes. Sales fell to \u00a34.8m in the first half, resulting in a \u00a3500,000 loss including costs related to a new internet site. </p> <p>The gardening business, which delivers bedding plants, bird feed and gardening tools, fared somewhat better with sales of \u00a311.2m and profits of \u00a31.6m. The firm also sells audio books and DVDs through mail order. </p> <p>Founded in 1981, Flying Brands floated on the stock market in 1993. It is now run by Tricia Killen, who took over as chief executive in June after spending 23 years at Reader's Digest.</p>",
  "<p>An 18-year-old man shot dead in a shop in south London was an innocent bystander caught up in a suspected gang fight, Scotland Yard said today.</p> <p>Ryan Bravo was shot in a Costcutter shop in Walworth last night and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p> <p>A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and was being held at a south London police station. Officers from Operation Trident, set up to investigate gun crime in London's black communities, were leading the investigation. </p> <p>Bravo is the 22nd teenager to die violently in London this year. Police said he was shot moments after two other black men of a similar age pushed their way into the shop behind him. They were thought to have been running away from someone else, and several shots were fired.</p> <p>The victim's mother tonight described him \"a decent, hard-working young man\" who was greatly missed.</p> <p>\"This is an extremely difficult time for all of us that knew and loved Ryan and I would ask that we are given the time and space to grieve in private,\" Elfrida Kiffin said.</p> <p>\"I would urge anyone that knows or saw anything to come forward and assist officers from Operation Trident in their ongoing efforts to trace witnesses to this cold-blooded and reckless act.\"</p> <p>A local man who was in the shop said he heard up to four shots in less than 10 seconds. \"I was in the shop last night buying cigarettes and four or five guys ran in. I didn't think anything bad was going to happen because I thought they were joking and laughing. </p> <p>\"They didn't look scared or angry or anything. But then I heard shots, three or four. I've never seen anyone get shot before. It was like something out of a film. </p> <p>\"It was all over in about seven seconds. I just put all of my stuff down and ran out of the shop. A hysterical lady ran out after me. Two people ran out, got on mopeds and drove away. I'm lucky to be alive.\"</p> <p>Another witness said the victim was hit in the back of the neck as panicked shoppers tried to escape. </p> <p>Detective superintendent Gary Richardson, from Trident, said: \"We are keeping an open mind regarding the motive of this murder. However, it appears at this stage that the victim has no links to gang activity and that he was an innocent bystander caught up in the crossfire, and was not the intended target. </p> <p>\"The victim was walking down Walworth Road with family members. As they entered Costcutters, two black men forced their way into the shop behind them as if they were trying to get away from something. As they did so, shots were fired. </p> <p>\"Up to five male suspects drove away on three mopeds in the direction of Boyson Road. </p> <p>\"I am appealing for anyone who was inside Costcutters or outside the shop at the time of the shooting to contact police.\"</p> <p>Police were called at about 9.40pm to the Walworth Road store, which is close to the junction with Camberwell Road. Paramedics could not save the shot man and he was pronounced dead at the scene at 10.25pm.</p> <p>Those responsible may have been prowling the area for some time, possibly as they searched for their intended victims, police said. </p> <p>Investigators were also considering whether the murder was linked to a shooting in Lambeth earlier in the day when a youth was hit in the leg.</p> <p>The shop remained shut today and was cordoned off with a police guard. A post-mortem examination was to be held at Greenwich mortuary. </p> <p>Seventeen London teenagers have died in stabbings this year and another three have been shot dead.</p>",
  "<p>A US judge sent Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to jail moments after the mayor pleaded for forgiveness and admitted he made an unauthorised trip to Canada on city business, a violation of his bond.</p> <p>\"The first day you were before me, I thought I made it clear to you that this court comes first in everything,\" judge Ronald Giles said. \"I do understand that you're under ... pressure ... but I have to look at how the system should be run and perceived by the public.\"</p> <p>\"At the beginning of this case you were given every privilege that could be given to you with regard to travel,\" Giles said, adding that he later imposed restrictions after learning Kilpatrick had been abusing his privileges.</p> <p>\"At that time I made it perfectly clear ... don't come back,\" he said.</p> <p>Court officials said Kilpatrick would remain in jail until he either posts the full $75,000 bond or until his lawyers can persuade a Wayne County Circuit Court judge to overturn the decision. But first, Kilpatrick would be taken to the 36th District Court detention area.</p> <p>Giles' comments came after Kilpatrick told the judge he had been living under incredible pressure for the last seven months.</p> <p>\"I don't believe that there is a person that's ever been through this process that respects it more than I do,\" Kilpatrick said, referring to the legal proceedings stemming from the eight felonies ranging from conspiracy to perjury to misconduct in office to obstruction of justice filed against him in March.</p> <p>\"Last week was a tremendous wake-up call to me,\" he said, referring to Giles' rebuke last month after Kilpatrick allegedly assaulted law enforcement officials trying to serve a subpoena.</p> <p>Kilpatrick admitted violating the terms of his bond by travelling to Windsor without notifying the court. He said he was sorry.</p> <p>\"My life has been revolutionarily transformed and it's transforming in front of the eye of these media people who don't know me at all,\" he said, referring to what he called intense scrutiny. \"Your honour, I ask for your forgiveness ... it will never happen again.\"</p> <p>He said his sons were watching these proceedings because he asked them to. \"I told them that I did something wrong,\" he said.</p> <p>Kilpatrick further said he was not \"frolicking\" in Windsor but trying to make a deal that would let him avoid laying off more than a thousand city workers.</p> <p>\"I apologise to the citizens as well, but mostly to you. It was never an affront to you,\" he said of the trip.</p> <p>Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Robert Moran said the mayor's pleas rung hollow.</p> <p>\"Now that he's caught, he's taking responsibility ... he thought he got away with it,\" Moran said.</p> <p>Prosecutors had argued before Kilpatrick addressed the court that the mayor was not taking the case against him seriously.</p> <p>\"The defendant left the State of Michigan, left the country, without prior notice to the court,\" Moran said, referring to a recent trip to Windsor. \"All you have to have him do is call me ... he has my cell phone, he can call me anytime ... we would never say the mayor of Detroit cannot travel for an emergency matter.\"</p> <p>Moran said he found out about the trip from the media.</p> <p>\"That is a flagrant violation of this court's order,\" Moran said. \"At the very least we are going to ask the court to cut off all travel to the defendant ... for business or personal, because he violated the very generous terms that this court has set up.\"</p> <p>\"It's not serious to him that he's a criminal defendant,\" he added.</p> <p>Kilpatrick attorney James Thomas acknowledged that the mayor violated the terms of his bond, but said it was an emergency.</p> <p>\"Who was dying?\" Giles asked.</p> <p>\"The City of Detroit was sick,\" Thomas said, adding that the mayor was trying to save a $75m deal that would help balance Detroit's budget.</p> <p>Last month, Giles put new restrictions on Kilpatrick's travel after Wayne County law enforcement officials accused him of the assault. The judge also revoked the mayor's personal recognisance bond and required him to post $7,500 cash to remain free.</p>",
  "<p><strong>ONWARD CRISTIANO SOLDIERS</strong></p> <p>You know those scenes near the end of movies like Armageddon and Apollo 13 where lots of caffeine-fuelled, sweaty, bespectacled, middle-aged men in mission control cheer raucously and hug when it becomes apparent that the stricken spaceship has, against all odds, successfully re-entered the earth's atmosphere? Well they're <em>nothing</em> compared to the scenes that were played out in newsrooms around the country when, 10 weeks after his promised deadline, Cristiano Ronaldo <em>finally</em> announced he's staying at Manchester United.</p> <p>\"I can confirm that I'll be playing for Manchester United next season,\" said Ronaldo, prompting sports editors everywhere to punch the air and pour warm champagne into paper cups before gazing wistfully at photos of their wives and kids. \"I'll be playing with my heart and soul and I will fight and honour the shirt with the same desire as I always have,\" he continued, prompting Manchester United fans everywhere to recall that Big Cup match away to Meeeelan last season, when the petulant primadonna disappeared from view.</p> <p>Ronaldo went on to put cynics who thought money had motivated his demands for a move to Real Madrid firmly back in their collective box. Contrary to the lies they'd been spreading, it was the desire for \"a new challenge\" and the prospect of being \"an hour's flight from my mother\" that made a move to Madrid seem attractive. After all, what rich, handsome 23-year-old ladies' man doesn't want to live as close as possible to his stereotypically demanding Mediterranean mum?</p> <p>Quite how United fans will react to Ronaldo's announcement is anyone's guess, although being as fickle as the next set of sheep they'll probably boo him half-heartedly for 10 minutes before being won over by a dive in the opposition box.

  "<p>Pakistan's fragile coalition government today announced plans to impeach President Pervez Musharraf, throwing the country into new political turmoil.</p> <p>Musharraf was today plotting his response with advisers and finally cancelled an on-off trip to the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. Pakistan's top military commanders also reportedly met today and the reaction of the army - which was, until recently, led by Musharraf - will now be key. </p> <p>The breakthrough for the coalition - which has been able to agree on little since coming to office four months ago - came after three days of talks between the parties that came to power after elections in February, led by Asif Zardari of the Pakistan People's party (PPP) and Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N). </p> <p>\"We want to make a new Pakistan,\" said Zardari, sitting with his coalition partners at a press conference in Islamabad. \"We have the votes and the political will.\" </p> <p>The coalition must prove that the president has subverted the constitution or is guilty of gross misconduct. Musharraf's decision to dismiss the country's judiciary and suspend the constitution for a six-week period last November may form the basis of the impeachment.</p> <p>But impeachment will not be easy; it requires a two-thirds majority in parliament, and while the elections brought Musharraf's opponents to power, the numbers are close. The bigger immediate concern is Musharraf's constitutional power to dismiss the parliament, under a mechanism that was used three times in the 1990s to sack governments. </p> <p>If the president believes that the army is with him, he may be tempted to use this authority. Impeachment has never been used in Pakistan before and there are fears that it could provoke another military intervention. </p> <p>\"This decision was taken in haste. They are playing with fire,\" said Amin Fahim, an estranged senior member of the PPP. \"Every action has a reaction.\" </p> <p>The president has repeatedly said he will not allow himself to be forced from power. Earlier this year, Musharraf - whose autobiography is pointedly called In the Line of Fire - warned that \"I cannot preside over the downfall of Pakistan\".</p> <p>The Pakistan military has indicated that it wishes to stay out of politics following Musharraf's decision to give up the job of army chief in November, when he stubbornly clung on to his other role of president. </p> <p>However, it is unclear whether the men in uniform, who have staged multiple coups in Pakistan's turbulent history, will stand aside while a former army chief is humiliated and dragged out of office. </p> <p>Sharif said today that he was confident that \"this is not the Pakistan of the 80s and 90s\". Zardari said that it was the wish of his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December last year, that her death would become \"a catalyst of change\". </p> <p>Sharif's current politics are based on two themes: removing Musharraf and restoring to office the judges he sacked in November. However, many remain sceptical about Zardari's sincerity about either of those causes. </p> <p>In March Zardari made another dramatic announcement, also sitting alongside Sharif, that he would reinstate the judiciary. After four months in government, those judges remain out of office, and the PPP has come up with a series of reasons why it could not happen yet. However, impeachment is a far more complicated and risky manoeuvre than bringing the judges back. </p> <p>The PPP came to power after months of careful secret negotiations with Musharraf and many believe that it continues to work on the basis of a \"deal\" that it forged with him. Under that arrangement, dozens of criminal charges against Zardari and Bhutto were dropped. </p> <p>\"Asif [Zardari] and Pervez Musharraf are inseparable, for their own self-interest,\" said Iqbal Haider, a former law minister under Bhutto's government of the 1990s. \"Impeachment is a device to distract attention from the restoration of the judges.\" </p> <p>In the past, Musharraf has enjoyed strong support from Washington, as a major ally in the \"war on terror\", which has given Pakistan billions of dollars in military aid. But it is now widely thought that he can no longer rely on the White House to bail him out.</p>",
  "<p>Police in New Zealand hunting a prolific burglar have issued a wanted poster bearing a photograph of the British actor Robbie Coltrane. </p> <p>Although the photograph of Coltrane has the word \"wanted\" above it and \"active burglar in this neighbourhood\", officers stressed that the actor was not accused of committing any crime.</p> <p>The suspected burglar is a 16-year-old, but because New Zealand law bans the publication of photographs of juvenile suspected criminals, police in Christchurch decided to use Coltrane's face instead.</p> <p>Text below the picture of Coltrane, who is best known for his roles as criminal psychologist Eddie Fitzgerald in the television series Cracker and Hagrid in the Harry Potter movies, explains to readers: \"Robbie Coltrane is not the burglar, but imagine him aged 16 with lank, greasy hair and you have the picture. </p> <p>\"The burglar lives locally and travels by bicycle to commit his crimes. </p> <p>\"He will break windows to gain entry and ransack property, targeting electronic items, cash and jewellery.\" </p> <p>\"Because of the Children and Young Persons Act 1989, police cannot show you a picture of the 16-year-old burglar operating in your neighbourhood.\" </p> <p>Police said that because of the alleged offender's resemblance to a younger Coltrane, officers frustrated by the legal restrictions on what they could publish came up with the scheme. </p> <p>Local police sergeant Phil Dean told New Zealand's One News programme: \"Our interest is in shutting him [the burglar] down, preventing him from committing any further crime.</p> <p>\"It's a provocative thing to get people to read our crime prevention information.\" </p> <p>Copies of the leaflet have been circulated to the letterboxes of homes in central Christchurch, the biggest city in South Island.</p> <p>Pat Creasey of the local Neighbourhood Support group, said reaction to the poster had been largely positive. \"I think Mr Coltrane would think it was a bit of a hoot. I'm sure he would be fully supportive of it.\" </p> <p>Coltrane's agent in London was unable to comment on the poster and said the actor was currently out of the country.</p>",

Even the emergence of new post-Hillary PACs like <a href=\"http://www.womencount.org\">www.womencount.org</a>, which launched with a campaign that \"calls on party leaders to 'stop the silence' when examples of sexism occur on the campaign trail\".

The 'Soccer Moms' of yesteryear have given way to the 'Carrie' voters of today; we are led to believe the presence or absence of husbands and/or children changes the way women (rather than men) view their worlds.\"</p> <p>That's half true. The presence of my soon-to-be child has altered the way I think about voting, and while that obviously has something to do with my husband, he's not strictly the reason. Doesn't matter if I'm married or single. It's about responsibility. And, like most women, I have plenty of it.</p> <p>Women control 84 cents of every household dollar spent, and we earn about 43% of a two-partner household income. Which makes us anxious. Which means that many of us will vote on the economy in November. But we will vote on <em>our</em> economy - responsible governance and helpful public policy that allows us to do what we want and need to do: work. I feel it's safe to say most women would pay higher taxes for a more effective government. We won't pay to support interest payments on the Iraq war. Women are traditionally more open to an active government, and we believe government can do good, according to a 2004 Women's Voices, Women's Vote poll. </p> <p>Chatting this week, two women I respect a lot, the aforementioned Omero and <a href=\"http://www.digital-sistas.org/home.shtml\">Shireen Mitchell</a>, highlighted the growing prominence of state and local campaigns for issues like pay equity, reasonable childcare, and other public policy instruments that make it possible for women to maintain economic control. Groups like <a href=\"http://MomsRising.org\">MomsRising.org</a> are making change on the state level. On the national level, it's all about gas prices, which are very relevant to most women, but merely a symptom of many other problems.</p> <p>So if the candidates want to win women's votes, they need to address women's economic concerns in a meaningful and consistent way. They need to beat the drum. McCain is doing this very effectively with his use of former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as a spokesperson. Back from Europe, Obama is starting his campaign to talk to voters on the economy this week. Speaking on energy, he called for a $7,000 tax credit to drivers who buy advanced-technology vehicles and $4bn in direct assistance to Detroit automakers to help them build hybrid vehicles in the US. That sounds right to me: help me make smart economic choices, and I'll help pay for smart government.</p>",
  "<p>China has done \"everything humanly possible\" to clear the air in time for the Beijing games, the International Olympic Committee chief has said.</p> <p>Praising the games' hosts on the eve of the opening ceremony, Jacques Rogge said pollution levels were decreasing and the air quality was safe for athletes.</p> <p>\"I think, objectively, we can say that the Chinese authorities have done everything that is feasible and humanly possible to solve the situation or to address the situation,\" Rogge said at a news conference at the close of a three-day IOC general assembly. \"What they have done is extraordinary.\" </p> <p>The IOC chief spoke as the city remained shrouded in a light gray haze for another day, but Rogge was at pains to distinguish between humidity-induced fog and pollution. </p> <p>\"The fog you see is based on humidity and heat,\" he explained. \"Of course, we prefer clean skies but the most important thing is the health of the athletes being protected.\" </p> <p>But he reiterated that outdoor endurance events, such as the marathon, could be postponed or rescheduled if smog levels are too high. </p> <p>Rogge's comments came as four of the American cyclists issued an apology for arriving at the airport wearing protective respiratory masks.</p> <p>US Olympic chief Jim Scherr admitted the athletes had been \"overly cautious\" and that it had not been the \"most opportune time\" to wear the masks.</p> <p>So far, athletes appear to have been pleasantly surprised. \"It's better than I expected,\" US rower Jamie Schroeder said. \"I've come to Beijing three times before. I used to go out to the Great Wall and was always struck, when I came back into the city, by how smoggy it was. But this time, you can't smell any burning or pollutants, so that's progress.\"</p> <p>The IOC will be monitoring the air quality on an hourly basis at 21 reporting stations and receive 72-hour weather forecasts. The high temperatures and humidity could also be a health concern during the games. </p> <p>According to recent figures, compiled by the China Environmental Monitoring Centre, the Air Quality Index across the city was measured at 88 - below the 101 the Chinese authorities regard as unsafe, but higher than the World Health Organisation safety limit of 50. </p> <p>The chairman of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission, Professor Arne Ljungqvist, said a high reading on a single day would not be dangerous for athletes and spectators unless they had an existing medical condition.</p> <p>Beijing's smog has been a concern in the run-up to the games. With some of the world's highest emissions of sulphur dioxide, soot and other pollutants, China has invested $17.3bn (\u00a38.9bn) to improve air quality in the capital. </p> <p>But the measures were not enough to shift the haze that has hung over the city in the run-up to the Games, prompting the Chinese authorities to introduce a string of traffic control measures. </p> <p>Some 300,000 high-polluting vehicles have been banned during the games. Gridlock was relieved by imposing alternate-day driving rules \u2013 even number plates on one day, and odd number plates the next - effectively halving the 3.3m vehicles on the road. </p> <p>Major construction works were also halted and more than 100 factories in Beijing and 56 power plants, many of them coal-fired, were shut down for the duration of the games.</p> <p>When that failed to have the desired effect, Chinese officials widened the area of factory-and-driving restrictions to include Tianjin, a city with the same population as New York. </p> <p>Rogge said anti-pollution measures would have long-term benefits for the city.<br> \"These are not short-term, one-shot measures. These are going to continue and to have a lasting influence on the climate of Beijing and I'm sure that when you come back, if the Chinese have continued their efforts, they will be rewarded,\" he said. Air quality in more than half of 300 Chinese cities failed to meet World Health Organisation standards in previous studies, and roughly 300,000 people die each year in China from diseases linked to air pollution.</p>",
  "<p>Apprentices must no longer be excluded from the national minimum wage and should earn at least \u00a3110 a week, unions demanded today.</p> <p>The Trades Union Congress said apprentices should enjoy protections similar to those other workers enjoyed.</p> <p>Exemption from the legislation was leaving apprentices vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous employers, some of whom were paying their young trainees nothing, the TUC argued. This was causing too many to drop out before completing their training, and jeopardising plans to increase apprentice numbers. </p> <p>Boosting the apprenticeship programme for 16- and 17-year-olds is a crucial component of the government's plans to raise the compulsory education leaving age to 18.</p> <p>Unions have until now accepted the Low Pay Commission's (LPC) rationales for leaving apprentices out of minimum wage protection: namely that they were getting training that would lead to a secure job and higher pay, and they were less productive than other workers in their first year.</p> <p>\"However,\" the TUC's submission to the LPC's review of the exemption warned, \"the new face of apprenticeships is often very different to the traditional model, and these changes need to be reflected in the pay and protections available to all apprentices.\"</p> <p>At present, apprentices aged under 19 and older apprentices in the first year of their programmes are exempt from the national minimum wage. The TUC says these categories account for 70% of apprenticeships.</p> <p>In 2005, the introduction of an \u00a380 minimum weekly pay rate for apprentices in England (\u00a355 in Scotland, \u00a350 in Wales and \u00a340 in Northern Ireland) had a big impact in improving completion rates, the TUC points out. </p> <p>The TUC is calling for minimum pay rates for apprentices in all parts of the UK to be raised to \u00a3110 - roughly equivalent to the national minimum wage for teenagers.</p> <p>The rate of improvement over the past five years has been greatest in low-paid sectors such as childcare (181%), health and social care (150%) and hairdressing (125%).</p> <p>The TUC argues that these rates still need to improve, particularly in low-paid sectors, where around four in 10 apprentices fail to complete their training. Raising pay in line with the minimum wage would help, it says.</p> <p>Some commentators have expressed concerns that making employers pay more could cut the numbers of apprenticeships on offer and hinder efforts to hit the government's target of 500,000 by 2020.</p> <p>But the TUC's report said: \"A strong counter-argument would be that decent minimum pay rates make it more likely that apprentices will complete their training.\" </p> <p>\"This in turn will have a positive impact on the reputation of the brand, and encourage more employers to participate.\" </p> <p>Although most apprentices get at least the \u00a380 weekly minimum, 5% receive less, according to a survey last year by the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Dius). These were most likely to be in sectors with larger numbers of female apprentices. In both the childcare and hairdressing sectors, the bottom 10% of earners received less than \u00a380 a week.</p> <p>In some cases, employers tried to continue paying people the \u00a380 minimum after they had completed their apprenticeships. And in certain sectors - notably retail, health and social care and customer service - apprentices reported getting no pay at all.</p> <p>Though the traditional apprenticeship lasted three years or so, many now are completed within a year. </p> <p>This fact did not justify a continuation of the exemption from the national minimum wage, a TUC spokesman said, because trainees were now clearly being expected to pull their weight more than in earlier times. </p> <p>\"Apprenticeships are very different today from the traditional model, with many trainees finishing their programme within a year,\" said the TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber. \"This development must be reflected in their pay and conditions.</p> <p>\"Ten years on from the minimum wage becoming law, millions of low-paid workers have benefited from better pay and protection from exploitation. It's now time for apprentices to benefit from these rights, too.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Middlesbrough. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Laura Susan Simmons (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Richard Elliott (guitar, keyboards), Wesley John Stephenson (drums). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> There's been a bit of a thread, or a theme, running through the new band choices this week. We started, on Monday, with Babygod, on Tuesday we had Oh, Atoms who seemed to be suffering from infantile dementia, yesterday's Red Light Company were obsessed with childhood toys and friends, and today we've got a bunch who sing about Sunday School and ice-cream vans. Just wait till you meet tomorrow's act, who, at 15, is the youngest ever New Band of the Day. Next week, we bring you an all-singing, all-dancing foetus. Possibly. <br> Das Wanderlust fetishise adolescence although we hasten to add they don't fetishise adolescents, not as far as we know anyway. They're a bit C86, a bit riot grrrl, and a lot like Tallulah Gosh having a party in a sweetshop with the Fall while Willie Wonka injects Aero bubbles in their veins. They have so far released two scruffy, scrappy, skew-whiff, hyperactive 7-inch singles, the first of which, The Orange Shop, was No 1 in BBC 6 Music \"DJ\" Marc Riley's singles of the year countdown. They have recorded all the right sessions for all the right radio stations, even though they call what they do \"wrong pop\", a title they came up with because it's pop that's misshapen, messed-up, wonky \u2026 wrong. Critics have been unable to decide whether it's structure-less avant-garde experimentalism or tuneful noise, so we'll decide for them: it's an amateurish racket performed by \"musicians\" who don't give a Curly Wurly about musicianship that occasionally, accidentally, chances upon a memorable snatch of melody. It's a 40-year-old man's idea of what 14-year-old girls are into. To be honest, it's a bit creepy, but not in a good way.  What else can we tell you without putting you off? They've got a dog modelling one of their promo T-shirts on their website. The B-side to their next single, Puzzle, which was recorded, not surprisingly, in their singer's bedroom (did they wear pyjamas? Probably), comes in six parts, with subtitles like Theme to a Fictional Spaghetti Western With Whistling, Big Black Ice Cream Van, When You're a Bairn Every Day is Like a Holiday and You Know When it's Not Quite Right? Well it's Not Quite Right. Wacky, them? Their best song, Humbug, has some loony-girl-in-the-attic vocals (\"I have no self-esteem, la-la-la,\" goes Laura Susan Simmons, quite amusingly) and a giant riff made out of a warped guitar/toy keyboard combo that is mesmerising and disturbing in equal measure. And they've got a song called I Wish I Was a Robot that sounds like it was assembled by androids dreaming of electric students during Fresher's Week. They apparently \"find the smokescreen and mirrors of affectation employed by many other groups both hilarious and infuriating\" although really, what's funny but not that annoying is, this is as affected and disingenuous as anything we've heard all year.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"As comforting and sticky as an ice-cream on a hot summer's day.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> John Peel would have loved them. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Reform in 2086 for the C86 centenary tour. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Attract much interest in a wonky pop style \"wrong pop\" tour.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Puzzle is released by Don't Tell Clare on October 6, followed by debut album Horses for Courses. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Kenickie, Huggy Bear, Bis, Tallulah Gosh. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/daswanderlust\">www.myspace.com/daswanderlust</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> CHARLIXCX</p>",
  "<p>Ryanair fired the first salvo in a price war today as it halved its cheapest fares. </p> <p>Europe's largest low-budget carrier is offering one million seats at \u00a35 next month including charges and taxes. It will lose at least \u00a35 on each UK sale, because the fare does not cover the \u00a310 air passenger duty charge.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the move represented a halving of its so-called T fares, the cheapest on Ryanair flights, which represent about half of the seats sold per flight. </p> <p>He said: \"If passengers are booking ahead of the 80% seat target, we will close off the cheap seats. If we are booking behind it, we will open up more cheap fares.\" </p> <p>O'Leary said the primary motive for the sale was to stimulate faltering demand rather than drive rivals out of business. He said high oil prices would have a far greater impact on financially weak airlines than another cut-price seat offer. </p> <p>\"Ultimately it is oil and the operating losses that will force some of these guys to the wall,\" said O'Leary. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/ryanair\">Ryanair</a> flights break even when the planes are 80% full and O'Leary admitted the airline was having to \"dump\" fares in order to fill its planes, amid weakening demand for seats. </p> <p>\"We will dump the price to wherever it needs to be in order to get to 80%,\" O'Leary vowed. </p> <p>Ryanair is heading for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/29/theairlineindustry.travelleisure\">its first loss in 20 years</a> due to high fuel costs, driven by the global oil spike, and weakening passenger demand. </p> <p>The Dublin-based carrier said it would plunge from a profit last year of \u20ac439m (\u00a3347m) to a loss of up to \u20ac60m if the cost of keeping planes in the air stayed at record levels. </p> <p>The profit warning was compounded by an admission that the sales outlook was weaker than expected and a planned 5% fares increase would have to be reversed - underlined by today's sale. </p> <p>The carrier is grounding 20 planes this winter in order to conserve costs, a move that is being replicated across the industry with a 7% capacity cut among all airlines - equivalent to nearly 60m fewer seats - taking place in the final quarter of 2008. </p> <p>Some experts have warned fares will rise as a result, but low-budget carriers such as Ryanair, whose business model is predicated on the pile-high sell-cheap principle, are under pressure to slash ticket prices due to the wider economic downturn. </p> <p>O'Leary said he wanted a recent fall in the oil price from $147 per barrel to around $120 per barrel to be reversed, in order to ensure Europe's most cash-strapped airlines were not bailed out by banks willing to take a risk on an industry revival. </p> <p>\"If airlines get a break in the oil price, some of them will get financing from some idiot. The more expensive oil is, the faster we roll up the loss-making companies that are not going to survive anyway.\" </p> <p>O'Leary confirmed plans to launch hand luggage-only flights in the autumn. The experimental ban on checked-in bags will take place on four routes: Dublin to Cork, London to Glasgow, Rome to Milan Bergamo and Frankfurt Hahn to Berlin. </p> <p>About four out of 10 Ryanair passengers travel without bags since the airline introduced bag check-in fees. Ryanair will make a few flights per day hand luggage-only but will not ban checked-in luggage entirely on the four routes.</p>",

Is nothing sacred in advertising these days?</p> <p>Looking at it pragmatically, it's hard to argue with the logic. Adverts need to reflect the times as well as shape them and with the economy looking dicier by the day, the remorseless happy clappy vibe Halifax have cultivated over the past few years needs to be toned down. Halifax owe a debt to society, having produced some of the most annoying adverts of recent times. At a time when we're trying to reduce gun crime the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX_XaLmCIS0\">\"something good\" beach extravaganza</a> had many of us reaching for revolvers. (Still, 60 times more interest though? That seems EXTRAORDINARY).</p> <p>But if Halifax do drop Howard, who should they replace him with? They'll want to keep the singing - the \"staff as stars\" campaign has been a resounding success yielding a 150% increase in sales and a 43% increase in profit per current account customer. You don't need to be a banker to know that that adds up.</p> <p>Who best to sing the songs of economic recession? My first thought is for Halifax to adopt <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w09h0unzZJE\">Stereolab's Ping Pong</a> for their next campaign. This irresistible drop of sugarcoated retro-pop features L\u00e6titia Sadier's Marxist social commentary on the cruel capitalist boom-and-bust cycle. \"Huger slump and greater wars and a shallower recovery\" is exactly the kind of tell-it-like-it-is realism the Halifax is going for, as I understand it. And if grassroots revolution leading to socialist utopia follows well, that's just a bonus.</p> <p>Too radical you think? Very well - history will give us pointers. The Great Depression of the 30s-produced Harburg and Gorney's Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?, a heartfelt rendering of a nation's crushed dreams, it encapsulated an era like few songs before or since. Of course, people remember <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZHEkU__Ijw\">Bing Crosby's immaculate version</a> but in the modern era, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVE72Ae82Tw\">definitive version was put on wax by Tom Waits</a>.</p> <p>If you were considering reckless financial behaviour, the vision of Waits' grizzled barroom balladeer growling at you of railroads, wars, brotherhood and betrayal is just what you need to persuade you to start tightening your belt and start saving for a rainy day - perhaps with Halifax's current account which offers 60 times more interest than other banks. (I'm just saying - 60 TIMES!)</p> <p>So if not Stereolab or Tom Waits then who? Who are the singers and what are the songs that Halifax should replace poor old TV Howard with? We need something fitting to take us into the spiral of misery, debt and unemployment that awaits us...</p> <p>Be warned though - mention of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqbrNwF8LJg\">Money's Too Tight to Mention</a> gets you an instant sitewide ban.</p>",
  "<p>The White House has categorically <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/06/ST2008080600042.html\">denied</a> that it ordered the CIA to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/06/iraq.iraq\">forge evidence that Saddam Hussein was conspiring with al-Qaida</a>, a charge made by journalist Ron Suskind in his new book <a href=\"http://www.ronsuskind.com/thewayoftheworld/\">The Way of the World</a>. The credibility of the Bush press office is such that one is tempted to take it as confirmation.</p> <p>There is an old joke about the guy who claimed he could tell when Henry Kissinger was lying, and when tested had a 100% success rate. When asked his secret, he says: \"His lips were moving.\"</p> <p>In the great tradition of White House weaselling, in part revealed by Scott McClellan's book, one notes that there is no denial that the so-called evidence was a forgery, and a very tightly specific repudiation of the White House's role that actually leaves ten thousand several other ways for forgeries to make their entrances. Indeed, in the light of Suskind's descriptions of Dick Cheney's hard work on providing deniability, the vice-president's office is one such.</p> <p>One question asked in the language of another expansive militarist empire is \"Cui bono?\" Who would benefit from such a forgery? It is clear that the allegations of an al-Qaida connection, like the equally spurious Niger yellowcake document, were intended to justify the war. Suskind's book should not be shocking to anyone.</p> <p>Like Hitler's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident\">Gleiwitz attack</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0805-09.htm\">Tonkin Gulf incident</a>, the carefully fed suggestions of Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks were crucial to getting public and political support for war. That was what made the spurious WMDs so threatening. Washington Post polls showed that 70% of the American public bought the al-Qaida connection, and indeed many of the troops apparently still do.</p> <p>But there were no proven, or even likely ties between al-Qaida and Saddam. Let us do the \"just the facts\" thing before the inevitable ad-hominem attacks on Suskind drive out his message. The Ba'athists were secular nationalists until Saddam became expediently pious after the first Gulf war. In addition, at no point did Saddam's regime allow any Islamist organisations to threaten his monopoly of political power. It was with mixed shock and amusement that I read Iraq's answer to the UN anti-terrorism committee's questionnaire, where the regime proved its impeccable credentials by citing its use of the death penalty for any remotely terrorist-linked offence.</p> <p>The only connection is that the invasion let al-Qaida and sundry other fundamentalists into Iraq, and Saddam's viciously efficient secret police were no longer in a position to deal with them. </p> <p>As for the weapons, by the time President Bush ordered the attack, Hans Blix's UN inspectors were in Iraq coming up blank in their search for weapons, confirming what Saddam's own son-in-law <a href=\"www.fair.org/index.php?page=1845\">Hussein Kamal</a> had said during his defection, that Saddam had indeed disarmed years before. It would certainly be likely that any defector like Tahir Jalil Habbush would say the same.</p> <p>But former CIA director George Tenet's statement in large measure vindicates Suskind's points. Intelligence agencies are there to provide evidence that suits their masters, not the truth. Tenet says that Habbush \"failed to persuade his British interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence, concessions or negotiations with regard to the Iraq crisis,\" and that \"There were many Iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that Iraq had no WMD \u2013 but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the Ba'ath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack. The particular source that Suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner.\"</p> <p>That meant that, unlike Ahmed Chalabi's inventive sources, they were not providing the necessary excuses for war that their interrogators wanted to hear.</p> <p>In summary, who are you going to believe: a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist or a White House that has provably lied about WMDs, about al-Qaida, about torture and indeed about almost any other subject?</p> <p>In face of the fear of lese-majest\u00e9 that afflicts most of Washington's media and political operatives, Ron Suskind deserves support. Although one has to wonder. He is being published by Rupert Murdoch, whose hands-on approach to publishing leads one to wonder whether Fox, the Wall Street Journal and the rest are about to eat eight years' worth of mendacious words.</p>",
  "<p><br> Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson at the New York premiere of Vicky Christina Barcelona. Photo: Rex</p> <p>If one picture were to sum up the gradual decline of Woody Allen it would be this. An old and frail man, his once trademark thick-rimmed glasses now an anachronism, caught in an inadvertent moment admiring his latest muse's principal talents. The subtext of the photo is clear: Allen, probably our greatest living auteur, a man who should by rights to be treated with the same respect as Scorsese, is something of a joke. </p> <p>In all fairness, he only has himself to blame. His faltering recent output, coupled with his admission in an interview that he only has the patience to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_oSW09sD0k\">\"shoot once and move on\"</a>, regardless of quality, means the likelihood of him ever making another Manhattan remain slim.</p> <p>A number of odd decisions made in this late period of his career have resulted in one of Allen's worst dry patches. Leaving his comfort zone of New York, opting for more serious fare for his last two films - neither has helped (likewise his somewhat icky private life).</p> <p>Cassandra's Dream was a trauma from which I've barely recovered. Dodgy accents, plot holes, ridiculous dialogue - not since Wild Wild West have I seen audience members leave a cinema within the first half hour. And while Match Point was well received in many quarters, it was sabotaged by an appalling performance from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who failed to convince as a human being, let alone one with a plummy English accent.</p> <p>It's in casting, as much as anything, that Allen has let himself down. Perhaps making decisions with the wrong part of his anatomy, where once he had Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow or Judy Davis standing next to him, now he has Scarlett Johansson - attractive, certainly, but incapable of turning in an Oscar-worthy performance like her forbears.</p> <p>Allen has always relied heavily on his female leads - and his persistently choosing Johansson (too attractive to play quirky, too young to play serious) seems the very oddest of his recent decisions. With reams of talented thespians closer to his own age doubtless chomping at the bit to work with such a legendary director, you have to wonder why he persists with an actress that does such little justice to his writing.</p> <p>Sure, there's an understandable motivation to work with such an attractive young woman. But every time old Woody juxtaposes himself with the young Scarlett he once again triggers that ick factor, reminding you of his domestic situation and effectively shooting himself in the foot.</p> <p>It's a problem only exacerbated by photos like the one above. After all, a shot of Allen admiring, even manhandling, Diane Keaton's cleavage would have struggled to make the front pages.</p>",
  "<p><br> High-flown fiction ... scene from Angel</p> <p>I'm rarely actually scared of seeing a film - the last time was when I was in the audience for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/92830/irreversible\">Gaspar No\u00e9's Irr\u00e9versible</a>, and found myself squirming and flinching and whimpering five minutes before it had even started.</p> <p>For a very different reason, I am scared to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121084/angel\">Fran\u00e7ois Ozon's Angel</a>, which is due for release here in a few weeks. The reason is that it is based on one of my favourite novels, Elizabeth Taylor's 1957 masterpiece Angel, and I am scared in case he messes it up, or gets it wrong or even that he re-interprets or changes it in some perfectly admissible way that I hadn't anticipated. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200709/editors-choice\">Elizabeth Taylor</a> is one of those novelists, like Patrick Hamilton or John Cowper Powys, who are forever being lost and then lavishly, briefly, \"rediscovered\". Perhaps ironically hampered in part by sharing a name with a famous Hollywood star, Taylor never enjoyed the acclaim that she should have with her shrewd and insightful portraits of provincial life. Her great novel Angel is in fact partly about the awful perishability of literary reputations.</p> <p>It's about a cheesy and absurd romantic novelist of the Edwardian era called Angelica Deverell, generally known as \"Angel\", whose ridiculous high-flown fictions of grand ladies and gentlemen are jeered at by the cognoscenti but sell like hot cakes with the public. She is based, partly, on novelists such as Marie Corelli or Rhoda Broughton, once wildly popular and wealthy and now, of course, utterly forgotten. A more familiar comparison might be Georgette Heyer.</p> <p>With elegance, clarity, effortless wit and brilliant observational touches - and over just 250 pages - Taylor shows the complete span of Angel's life. First, the vain, aloof schoolgirl, imaginative yet delusional, fiercely resentful of her demeaningly modest background, living with her widowed mother above a humble shop. She spins her yearning for a different existence into a miraculous untrained talent for fiction, filling notebooks with reams of stuff.</p> <p>Then there is the fabulously wealthy novelist, with bizarre and eccentric tastes in clothes and furnishing, living as she imagines a high-born person in public life should live, bullying and browbeating her publisher Theo, her poor mother and a Miss Nora Howe-Nevinson, the mousy-genteel lady of some means who consents to be her \"companion\", although this position is entirely asexual.</p> <p>Finally: there is the tragicomically imperious and batty old lady, living in the grand house she had always wanted to buy - shades of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gad's_Hill_Place\">Dickens and Gad's Hill</a> - obsessed with the memory of her husband Esm\u00e9, Nora's ne'er-do-well brother. He was a minor painter who cynically married Angel for her money and kept an awful secret from her, a secret in which Nora and Theo are miserably complicit until the very end.</p> <p>Each of these stages is instantly, stunningly plausible. Even though Taylor makes clear that everyone is always laughing at her, she brings off the considerable trick of inducing protective sympathy in the reader, and even a kind of awe at her crazy talent, perhaps genius, as mysterious in its origin as that of a genuinely great artist. Moreover, she never directly quotes a single line of Angel's books; perhaps Taylor considered that pastiche was too showy and studied a literary effect.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/evelynwaugh\">Evelyn Waugh</a>, I think, would have been proud to have created Angel and Nora, though he would probably have made them more minor characters, concentrating on their dotage in the run-down house and icily withheld the compassion they receive from Taylor. And they are a little like something from Dickens.</p> <p>Who could film such a book? My own feeling is that, published in 1957 as it was, the novel came sadly a bit too late for the great days of the Ealing comedy. Perhaps if it had been written just five or 10 years earlier, the dream team of Robert Hamer and John Dighton could have set to work on it, just as they worked on Roy Horniman's obscure 1907 novel Israel Rank, and turned it into <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/441483/\">Kind Hearts And Coronets</a>, starring Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini, the Edwardian serial killer who rises to a dukedom. Like Angel, Louis resents his humble station and glories in his social elevation.</p> <p>\"Who else could film Angel?\" I wondered, when I first read it. The only other directors who vaguely occurred to me were the Maysles brothers who made <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7QNN1cNgZU\">Grey Gardens</a>, about two impossible old ladies in an impossible old house.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.francois-ozon.com/english/interviews/angel.html\">Fran\u00e7ois Ozon</a> is an intriguing candidate. His movie, <a href=\"http://www.francois-ozon.com/english/trailer/5x2-five-times-two.html\">5x2</a>, showing the decline of a marriage in a series of scenes in reverse order, is a sort of masterpiece on its own. But will he \"get\" Angel? Will he get its Englishness, its humour, its absurdity and gentleness? Or will he over-emphasise its macabre quality?</p> <p>I'm nervous about finding out. Meanwhile, if you haven't read Angel by Elizabeth Taylor, there's a treat in store for you.</p>",

  "<p>African-Americans are <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-excited-voters\">excited about Barack Obama's success</a> so far. However what they expect of him during this presidential campaign is another matter. It is clear that there are a significant number of people, including those who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-Se6E4uZhs&amp;feature=related\">heckled him at a town hall meeting last week</a>, who expect an African-American candidate to focus on African-American issues and are disappointed that they have not been placed centre stage in Obama's campaign. </p> <p>The young African-American men who heckled Obama in Florida last week held up a banner that read \"What about the black community, Obama?\" They accused him of not addressing issues specific to African-Americans such as Jena 6, Hurricane Katrina and the killing of Sean Bell. They asked: \"Why is it that you have not had the ability to speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited black community in this country?\"</p> <p>Black British writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/race.usa\">Vanessa Walters expressed dismay</a> that Obama has distanced himself from rapper Ludacris's latest song, which features crude lyrics about Hillary Clinton, John McCain and George Bush. Writing in Comment is Free on Monday, she asserted: \"In the future, [Obama's] got to actually tackle some of the conflicts about being black and excluded.\" </p> <p>Regular Cif commenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/10/barackobama.race?commentid=c67d0aba-384f-47e8-80b7-48752b453c1e\">halgeel84</a> takes a great deal of umbrage at what she sees as Obama's lack of interest in black issues. She regularly expresses her concern about what Obama has not, for example, said \"with respect to the challenges black men is facing in America today such as lack of jobs, racial profiling, mass incarceration.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are legitimate. There are indeed serious problems within the African-American community that need to be not only addressed, but solved. It's also natural that African-Americans would hope that Obama, who apparently understands their struggles and challenges and may be about to become part of a system that has oppressed them for so long, would want to effect change on their behalf. </p> <p>However, should African-Americans be managing their expectations? After all, Obama is running for president of the United States, not the NAACP. He is not a civil rights activist. Obama has carefully built up an image as a man for all Americans, carefully treading a fine line when it comes to racial issues and avoiding any attempts to pigeon hole him as \"the black candidate\" whose exclusive concern is African-American issues. </p> <p>It isn't that Obama doesn't care about, or isn't addressing, these issues. He has spoken in front of all-black audiences in churches and town halls, recently addressed the NAACP Annual Conference and in April met with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1NA4T0F-rU\">North Carolina Black Press Association</a> to talk at length about African-American issues. In that discussion he acknowledged that \"we have some issues which are very specific to the African American community that have to be dealt with\" before going on to explain that \"my approach to this campaign has been to say that all Americans \u2013 black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, all of us - have an interest in seeing a more just and equitable society.\" </p> <p>It is that focus on all Americans, as opposed to just African-Americans, which is bothering some people. Considering that African-Americans tend to be at the bottom end of most aspects of American life, including disproportionate incarceration rates, a 25% poverty rate (as opposed to 8% for white Americans) and major economic inequality, this is understandable. A focus on everyone is great, they argue, but it is clear that African-Americans require more attention than others. But as Obama told the hecklers, he has indeed spoken out \"forcefully\" about the issues they have accused him of ignoring: \"Listen, I was a civil rights lawyer. I passed the first racial profiling legislation in Illinois. I passed some of the toughest death penalty reform legislation in Illinois. \u2026 That doesn't mean I am always going to satisfy the way you guys want these issues framed.\"</p> <p>The way in which Obama has framed the issues has been politically savvy. African-Americans who expect Obama to run as the \"African-American candidate\" and talk all day, every day about black issues are expecting him to fail in his bid to become president. When Jesse Jackson ran on an all black platform, it did not get him anywhere close to where Obama is now. </p> <p>The truth is that most Americans who Obama would be representing as president and therefore needs to appeal to care more about the economy, Iraq and the housing crisis than Jena 6. It does not mean, however, that African-American issues are not important, just that they are being addressed as just one part of the wider political whole. People may indeed have more success with these issues on a state or local level.</p> <p>Furthermore, the questions about what the next president will do to solve problems within the black community are not just for Obama. McCain \u2013 currently not so far behind Obama in the polls - should also be held to task.</p> <p>I understand why some African-Americans expect Obama to champion their causes more often and more publicly. However, by now they should have realised that Obama's campaign is not about them. At the end of the day, Obama may be an African-American, but he is an African-American whose role, should he become president, will be to stand for all people, regardless of race.</p>",
  "<p>Four past and present British Airways executives face up to five years in jail after being charged with price-fixing offences this afternoon in what will be the UK's most high-profile <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/06/britishairways.pricefixing\">cartel trial</a>. </p> <p>BA's head of sales Andrew Crawley, the former marketing director Martin George, the ex-communications head Iain Burns and Alan Burnett, who once ran UK and Ireland sales for the airline, have been charged with fixing passenger fuel surcharges in collusion with Virgin Atlantic. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/23/usnews.britishairways\">BA was fined \u00a3271.5m</a> by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and US authorities last year after it admitted fixing fuel surcharges for passenger and cargo flights. </p> <p>\"Martin George, Andrew Crawley, Alan Burnett and Iain Burns are charged with having dishonestly agreed with others to make or implement arrangements which directly or indirectly fixed the price for the supply in the United Kingdom of passenger air transport services by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways,\" said an OFT statement. </p> <p>The quartet are due to appear at City of London magistrates court on September 24. </p> <p>The men are now unlikely to be extradited to the US, where a criminal investigation is still ongoing, because anyone acquitted or convicted of price-fixing in the UK cannot be charged with the same offence across the Atlantic under double jeopardy rules. </p> <p>Six other former BA employees, including former Terminal Five boss Gareth Kirkwood, who was fired over the building's botched opening, are understood to remain under investigation by the US department of justice. </p> <p>The trial will bring further embarrassment for BA, whose reputation was dented when the scandal emerged, but it is also expected to lay bare Virgin Atlantic's full involvement in the scam. </p> <p>The airline founded by Sir Richard Branson escaped prosecution over the scandal because it blew the whistle on its collusion with BA - winning it immunity from punishment. </p> <p>However, two former Virgin Atlantic executives - the former commercial chief Willy Boulter and the former communications boss Paul Moore - have already been named in a class action lawsuit related to the case. </p> <p>The British Airways chief executive, Willie Walsh, has hinted that the airline wants Virgin Atlantic's role in the scandal to be made known. Last year, he said he would be \"very happy\" to see full details of the scandal emerge in court because people \"deserve to know what happened\". </p> <p>Following talks with class action lawyers, both airlines have set up a \u00a3100m compensation fund for passengers who were caught out by the collusion, which took place between August 2004 and January 2006. </p> <p>BA and Virgin admitted they conspired to fix fuel surcharges, which are levies imposed on tickets to cover the rising cost of fuel and now represent a sizeable chunk of any long-haul booking. </p> <p>Millions of passengers in Britain are entitled to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/16/theairlineindustry.britishairwaysbusiness\">a payout of up to \u00a320 per return ticket</a>, depending on the size of the surcharge when the ticket was booked. </p> <p>BA and Virgin Atlantic declined to comment, but Burns, who has since moved to Dubai where he works for the Etihad airline, released a statement through his lawyers stating that he intended to clear his name. </p> <p>\"At the time of these events, Iain Burns was the head of PR at British Airways with no responsibility for pricing decisions. Given his very high level of co-operation to the OFT, Iain is naturally disappointed with their decision. However, he hopes that it will allow this case to be fully analysed before a court and finally provide him with the opportunity to clear his name.\" </p> <p>Burns and George left BA in October 2006 after the scandal broke. George's departure aroused controversy when it emerged he was entitled to severance payments of up to \u00a31.6m. </p> <p>Price-fixing carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail under UK law. Three British businessmen, Peter Whittle, David Brammar and Bryan Allison, were jailed for between two-and-a-half and three years each in June for cartel offences under the Enterprise Act in a case brought by the OFT over the price-fixing of marine hoses.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone remember Gary Herbert? If you don't then you need to cast your mind back to the medal rostrum at Barcelona '92, and try to picture those two mammoth Olympians the Searle brothers towering over it. Herbert was the tiny man stood alongside who was crying his eyes out. The cox. The scene was like a Charles Atlas before-and-after ad. You couldn't help but think \"who the hell is that guy, and how did he get there?\"</p> <p>The cox looks like the runt of the litter. So even though I'd never met him before, it was easy to find Acer Nethercott at the GB rowing camp - I just looked for the smallest guy in the room.</p> <p>The perverse thing is that the cox is in many ways the leader of the boat. He's the guy with the whip at the front of the galley ship. It's a tough job that Nethercott has got. He's in the men's eight. In a boat of that length effective communication is all but impossible between the rowers. At the same time, their success depends on their total synchronicity, on unity in thought and action.</p> <p>This is Nethercott's job. He says he is \"the eyes and ears of the boat\", and I'd say he's the brain too. In the melee of the race, Nethercott does the thinking so his rowers don't have to. He watches the teams around them, and decides how to respond to them.</p> <p>He is also watching the cox-box by his feet, which tells him how many strokes his crew are taking each minute. If they dip below their target, Acer needs to work out why, and whether they need to worry. At the same time he is working the rudder, balancing the boat against the crosswind and keeping it from moving out of its lane, which would lead to disqualification.</p> <p>A dapper, donnish looking man with a mop of curly hair and a sharp, smooth face, Nethercott needs to have the total trust and faith of his crew. If they stop to doubt his awareness and decision-making, they will lose concentration and the race is lost.</p> <p>Likeable, and clearly happy to be in Beijing, Nethercott is indecently intelligent. Two months ago he completed a DPhil in the Philosophy of Language. \"What exactly?\" I ask with all the confidence of a man who has a 2:1 in English Lit.</p> <p>\"Linguistics. The semantics of complex demonstratives.\"</p> <p>\"Uh-huh\".</p> <p>In between qualifications (he has a BA in Physics and Philosophy and a Masters as well), Acer says he \"fell into\" international rowing. Surprisingly, he didn't start coxing until he got to university. Less surprisingly, that university was Oxford. He got there from a comprehensive school in Essex.</p> <p>\"When I got in, the first thing my gran said to me when I got in to Oxford was 'so am I going to see you in the Boat Race?' My grandparents lived through the war in the East End of London, in a working class district. They had really vivid, fond memories of going down each year to watch the race and randomly picking a side to cheer on from the bank.\"</p> <p>At the time this was just one of those over-optimistic suggestions that grandmothers are so fond of making. \"'I doubt it, nan,' I said, 'I've never been in a boat in my life.'\"</p> <p>Turned out she was right. Intrigued, he started coxing with his college and just got better and better. He graduated through the Oxford women's boat and reserve boat until he made the Blues in 2003. He was a member of the winning boat that year, and again in 2005.</p> <p>\"My nan was hugely proud when she stood on the Battersea bridge watching it. Never in a million years did she think that this could happen, I mean she was from the working class area of the East End, she didn't even think people like that could get to Oxbridge. She's taped all the races and she still watches them once a week, every Sunday.\"</p> <p>Now I know how he got there, I want to know what he does. I ask him to talk me through the race as he's visualised it with his coaches hundreds of times, the race that he hopes will take the boat to a gold.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of dead time on the start line, and an awful lot of noise. Not just the crowd, but the other crews. A lot of other nations go in for this caveman style grunting. They slap their legs and growl, so there are all these bizarre sounds coming over the water.</p> <p>\"I don't know whether it's a reflection of our national character but us Brits don't tend to go in for that. I'll just say one or two quiet things. Simple technical points, Then there's an amazing contrast as the call over comes, a deathly silence. You hear the buzzer and suddenly it's all noise again: 48 rowers, six coxes, all yelling and urging.</p> <p>\"I don't do much talking here, we've practiced it so that in the first 30 seconds or so I say very little. Some coxes yabber away, yaddayadda, but I don't think a rower can process all that, so I just give one or two cues the team are expecting to hear. Bang, we do that. Bang, we do this.</p> <p>\"Then from the sprint we manage the transition into racing pace, that's when the contest really starts. I look around and look at how we're going. The Germans are up on us, the Australians are half a boat back and the Dutch are a length ahead but they'll be soon be spent. Don't worry.</p> <p>\"Into the race plan, check the strokes, 37, 39. Are we where we want to be? If not, then why? A headwind? Then fine. We're still rowing well.</p> <p>\"The further down the track we go, the less prescriptive we can be with our strategy. We prepare for the final sprint. Are we defending a lead, or are we trying to sprint through someone? It's my job to make the call. Then the push for the line.\"</p> <p>And then maybe, just maybe, a medal. I hope his grandmother has set the timer on her VHS machine.</p>",
  "<p><strong>1) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq-C5-vIim8\">Shun Fujimoto, Montreal, 1976</a></strong></p> <p>A member of Japan's men's combined gymnastics team, Fujimoto received less attention than he might have done because he was sharing his showtime with Nadia Comaneci. His achievements, though, were remarkable.</p> <p>As Fujimoto finished the final tumble of his floor routine, he broke his kneecap. Understandably in agony, he however decided not to tell his coach or his team-mates about his injury. \"The competition was so close [Japan were battling USSR for the gold] and I didn't want the team to lose concentration worrying about me.\"</p> <p>Ridiculously, he then took part in his next event, the pommel horse, scoring 9.5 out of 10. Next up were the rings, and the promise of a dismount from eight feet in the air. \"I knew that if my posture was not good on landing, I would not receive a good score. I knew I must try to forget the pain\". He pulled a twisting triple somersault, later admitting \"the pain went through me like a knife\", before landing, grimacing as his knee buckled slightly, and, with tears in eyes, raising his arms aloft. He scored 9.7, his best ever result. </p> <p>Minutes later he staggered and fell. The kneecap, already broken, had now been dislocated as well, tearing the ligaments in his leg. Doctors forced him to withdraw from the competition. The Japanese team, now a man short, were inspired to gold by his sacrifice. Asked years later whether he would do it again, Fujimoto replied with an emphatic: \"No, I would not\".</p> <p><strong>2) Alfred Hajos, Stockholm, 1912</strong></p> <p>It's little appreciated now, but between 1912 and 1948, Olympic medals were awarded for achievement in literature, architecture, music, sculpture and painting, with the caveat that the work had to have been inspired by sport. Hajos was one of only two men in history to win medals in both artistic and sporting events, making him an authentic all-round Olympian. The other to do so, Walter Winans, won his gold for <a href=\"http://www.olympia-ausstellung.de/fileadmin/sportmuseum/content/olympia/28.jpg\"> this sculpture</a> and another in the now sadly defunct event of running deer (double shot).</p> <p>Hajos's feats, though, were far more spectacular. As a forward he won three championships in the Hungarian domestic football league, was also the Hungarian national champion at the 100 yards, 400 yard hurdles and discus.</p> <p>In 1896 he became the first swimming gold medallist in the modern games. Having won the 100m freestyle, he decided to race in the 1,200m freestyle later that same afternoon. Both events were taking place at sea, just off the port of Piraeus. The water temperature was recorded at 13C, and the waves were some 12ft high. Unsurprisingly, most of the field soon dropped out, but Hajos, swathed in goose fat, continued, attempting to follow a course marked out by a series of hollowed-out floating pumpkins. \"My will to live completely overcame my desire to win,\" Hajos recounted. He finished in 18 min 22 sec, some two minutes ahead of the man in second. Asked afterwards by the King of Greece where he had learned to swim in such a manner, Hajos drolly replied \"in the water\". In fact he had learned to swim aged 13 after seeing his father drown in the Danube and, after the Games, he went on to become, among other things, a successful architect. In 1924 his designs for a new national stadium won him a silver medal in arts.</p> <p><strong>3) George Eyser, St Louis, 1904</strong></p> <p>Oscar Pistorius has his running blades, George Eyser had a wooden peg. After a train ran over his left leg, Eyser had the limb amputated and replaced with a stump. Despite the handicap he won six medals in (able-bodied) gymnastics at the 1904 Games. He won gold medals in both the vault and the parallel bars in a single day, added another in the (again, now sadly defunct) rope-climbing competition. It seems especially tough to imagine how a man with a wooden leg could win a rope-climbing competition. He added silver medals in the combined event and on the pommel horse, and a bronze on the horizontal bars.</p> <p><strong>4) Karoly Takacs, London, 1948</strong></p> <p>Takacs, a sergeant in the Hungarian army, was European pistol shooting champion in the mid 1930s. But in his pomp in 1938 he lost his entire right hand, his shooting hand, when a defective grenade exploded while he was holding it. After spending a month in hospital, plagued by depression, he resolved to take up shooting with his left hand. Despite never having used his left before, in a year's time he surprised his former rivals by entering the national championship, which he duly won using his 'wrong' hand.</p> <p>War postponed his Olympic chances, but in 1948 he finally got an opportunity to demonstrate his remarkable prowess. Aged 38, he won gold by ten clear points, though he'd insisted on arrival that he had only \"come to learn\". He defended his title four years later in Helsinki.</p> <p><strong>5) Jack Beresford, Berlin, 1936</strong></p> <p>A British rower who won medals at five consecutive Games? Sounds familiar. Beresford would have preferred to have been a rugby player, but he lost much of his mobility after he was shot in the leg while serving with the Liverpool Scottish regiment in the first world war. He won a silver in the single sculls in 1920 (losing to Grace Kelly's father, Jack), gold in the same event in 1924, silver with the eight in 1928 and gold with the coxless four in 1932. His finest moment though, came at Berlin in 1936. Aged 37, he was competing in the double scull.</p> <p>The favourites for the event were the German pair, Willy Kaidel and Joachim Pirsch who were equipped with a modern lightweight boat far superior to Beresford's. Fortunately the Englishman was tipped off beforehand (by an English coach working for the German team) that if he were to have any chance of winning, he'd need a better boat, one able to match his rivals'. A new one was made at short notice and shipped out to Germany but the German authorities had an inkling of what was afoot and arranged for it to be lost in a railway siding outside Hamburg. It was 'discovered' just two days before the competition started. Worse still, biased umpiring meant that the German pair had been repeatedly able to false start their way through qualifying. Beresford and his partner Leslie Southwood, meanwhile, had to get to the final through the repachage.</p> <p>Once there, Beresford decided to take matters into his own hands. With Hitler watching, he held up the race at the start while removing his sweater, then positioned his boat so that the umpire's view would be concealed by the large megaphone he was using. He matched the German's false start. Then, level with 100m to go, Beresford and Southwood pulled away to win gold.</p> <p><strong>6) Wilma Rudolph, Rome, 1960</strong></p> <p>Rudolph was born in the impoverished black community of Clarksville, Tenneesee. Born prematurely, she weighed just 4.5lbs as a newborn and was afflicted by measles, mumps, scarlet fever and pneumonia before, aged just four, she was diagnosed as suffering from polio. Distraught, her mother refused to believe that Wilma would live her life in leg braces.</p> <p>Prevented from getting treatment locally by segregation, she took her twice a week to a hospital some 50 miles away, but mainly relied on home remedies and vigorous massage. Her mother's dedication was all the more astonishing given that Wilma was the 20th of 22 children.</p> <p>When she was 12, she was finally able to walk normally. She took a place in the high school basketball team, but was kept out of the starting team for three full years. When she did start, she quickly established herself as a star, leading her team to the State Championships.</p> <p>She switched to athletics aged 15, and the next year she was part of the USA team at the Melbourne Games, winning bronze with the sprint relay squad. It was four years later, though, that she wrote herself into history, winning gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m, despite the fact that she'd sprained her ankle three days before the Games started. On her return she became an icon of the campaign for racial integration.</p>",

  "<p>The news of the potential impeachment of President Pervez Musharraf means further political instability for Pakistan - at least in the short term.</p> <p>Though a deal has finally been done between the Pakistan People's party (PPP), effectively led by the late Benazir Bhutto's husband, Asif Zardari, and Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), this indicates a very temporary coincidence of interest rather than a new solidarity. The beleaguered president's decision not to go to China for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games indicates he is taking the threat seriously.</p> <p>No Pakistani president has ever been impeached and the procedure laid down in the 1973 constitution is likely to mean a classic drawn-out Pakistani politico-legal wrangle. Impeachment is a political process relying on a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament deciding to remove the president from office on grounds of gross misconduct, physical or mental impairment or violation of the constitution. </p> <p>Musharraf's declaration of a state of emergency last November, shortly after getting himself re-elected for a second five-year term, means the third option is the most likely to be invoked.</p> <p>But the PPP and the PML-N will need help from smaller groupings - including hardline religious elements and a significant number of the 17 independent parliamentarians - to get the impeachment through the National Assembly. Such support is uncertain at best and all assembly members - and particularly the independents - are likely to be the subject of frantic horse-trading.</p> <p>\"They will be seen as up for sale,\" said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, Professor of Political Science at Lahore University of Management Sciences.</p> <p>Equally Musharraf still has powerful and wealthy political allies such as the loyalists of the reduced but still effective Pakistan Muslim League-Q. And, any impeachment could prove to be unpopular at home and overseas. With Pakistan suffering an economic crisis and \"a grave threat from terrorism\" there is \"a feeling that this is not the moment to be divisive,\" Rais said.</p> <p>The issues of the restoration of around 60 judges removed from their posts by Musharraf when he declared the emergency last year is directly linked to the impeachment. \"They have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing,\" said Professor Osama Siddique, an expert in constitutional law in Pakistan.</p> <p>A simpler way of ousting Musharraf may simply be to use the threat of the impeachment to force him to opt for a confidence vote. However, given that he is unlikely to win, the president will resist such a move if he can.</p> <p>The west will be watching the evolving relations between the military and Pakistan's political leaders closely. A recent attempt to subject the country's powerful Inter Services Intelligence service (ISI) to civilian authority backfired badly. Though Musharraf still has some friends within the sprawling military establishment, few analysts believe the army will intervene. That February's general election was largely free and fair was in part due to the new Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kiyani. Many soldiers now consider the president as something of an embarrassment.</p> <p>The real winner may eventually be Nawaz Sharif, a two-time former prime minister who returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabia last year.</p> <p>Despite having little time to prepare a campaign, Sharif's PML-N party did well in the spring elections, especially in the key province of the Punjab.</p> <p>Sharif has the vote of much of the religiously conservative, patriotic commercial middle class in Pakistan's rapidly growing cities and has his finger on the popular pulse more than any other politician. And it is Sharif, who detests the president, who has pushed hard for impeachment.</p> <p>Musharraf still has the theoretical constitutional right to dissolve parliament - subject to eventual supreme court approval. This is the political smart bomb that the president could use to delay his impeachment - but only at the cost of provoking a new election and giving Sharif, who he ousted in 1999, the chance to consolidate his power. Whatever the result of this latest crisis, it is Sharif who is likely to come out on top.</p>",
  "<p>Do Chinese leaders ever wish they had never agreed to stage the Olympics? Probably not, but they may well have mixed feelings. On the plus side, China has built some <a href=\"http://video.aol.com/video-detail/inside-birds-nest-stadium/1534604647\">nifty-looking stadiums</a>, there has been an outpouring of national pride - especially among the young - and it sets the seal on China's ambition to be a global mover and shaker.</p> <p>Yet, the games have been a right pain too for the Chinese leadership. The event has turned into an irresistible magnet for human rights activists to protest many issues from Tibet to Darfur. Today, Christian activists were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/07/christian.protest.china\">arrested</a> at Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in 1989. </p> <p>Yesterday, four pro-Tibet demonstrators were deported after unfurling Free Tibet banners on a lamp post. For groups such as <a href=\"http://www.thechinadebate.org/en/\">Amnesty International</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/08/05/china19547.htm\">Human Rights Watch</a> and celebrity campaigners such as Mia Farrow, the Olympics has been an unparalleled opportunity to get their message across about human rights abuses in China and unsavoury regimes that Beijing supports.</p> <p>China has had to endure criticism not just from activists but from those higher up the food chain. George Bush today had some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2008/aug/07/george.bush.china.olympics\">blunt words</a> for China saying the US firmly opposes the detention of political dissidents, human rights advocates and religious activists. It could have been worse. Bush chose to speak in Bangkok rather than waiting to arrive on Chinese soil to sound off, so as not to rub Chinese faces in the dirt.</p> <p>But the Chinese are notoriously thin-skinned to criticism and will not appreciate Bush's words no matter where they were said. In Chinese eyes, what countries do at home is their own business; Chinese leaders don't pass judgment on others' domestic policies and they don't expect other governments to comment on China's internal affairs. This is the doctrine of state sovereignty at its most rigid. </p> <p>China's sensitivity to foreign criticism can also be attributed to past humiliation at the hands of outsiders. As <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21715\">Orville Schell reminds us this week in the New York Review of Books: </a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"A particularly important element in the formation of China's modern identity has been the legacy of the country's \"humiliation\" at the hands of foreigners, beginning with China's defeat in the opium wars in the mid 19th century and the shameful treatment of Chinese in America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Little wonder then that China puts so much importance in not losing face. China of course can hit back at the likes of the US for double standards. As Bush was calling on China to allow more freedoms to its own people, Osama bin Laden's driver was convicted of supporting terrorism - although he was cleared of more serious conspiracy charges - by a much-criticised military commission at Guantanamo Bay. The Chinese may also want to remind Bush once he arrives in Beijing - gently or not so gently - that he was the one that invaded Iraq in a war that Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, called illegal.</p> <p>Some commentators believe that the Olympics has actually prodded China to become a better international citizen. <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/04/opinion/edcha.php\">Victor Cha this week wrote in the International Herald Tribune</a> that China has taken away incentives for Chinese companies doing business in Sudan and cut arms sales to Burma after its crackdown last year against demonstrators, including monks. Others are downright dubious about holding the Olympics in China.</p> <p>In a piece for the Los Angeles Times, Heather Havrilevsky, wonders <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-havrilevsky7-2008aug07,0,7413817.story\">what on earth possessed Olympic organisers to award China the games.</a></p> <p>\"That good old Olympic spirit, set against the backdrop of the deeply depressing realities of life in China, makes this summer's festivities feel about as uplifting and cheerful as an accidental shooting at a wedding reception,\" she writes.</p> <p>The piece would have been more effective if she had not gone into overkill by talking about the \"systematic oppression of 1.3 billion people\". That is patent nonsense. This is a country that has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/04/do0404.xml\">lifted 250 million people out of poverty</a> in the last 30 years, which is an incredible achievement. Most of Africa would not be in such a mess if African governments had shown the same zeal in fighting poverty. As a Somali told me recently: \"The difference between China and Africa is that when Chinese leaders see the economic pie in front of them they want a small slice, but African leaders want the whole pie for themselves.\" But that is another debate.</p> <p>For the time being, the Olympics should be seen as a foretaste of what China can expect if it wants to assume a leadership role on the world stage. For China to expect that its domestic policies should not be criticised is totally unrealistic. Those who harbour pretensions to leadership are subject to scrutiny whether they like it or not. Notwithstanding all its past history of humiliation, China will have to acquire the political maturity to withstand criticism - fair or unfair - that comes with growing international power and prestige. Or as Truman said: \"If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen.\" The Olympics will be a good training ground for China to endure the barbs that will come its way in the years to come.</p>",

Ned Kelly, about the infamous Australian bushranger, made just over $6m (\u00a33m) worldwide, despite the presence of Heath Ledger, Naomi Watts and a post Lord of the Rings Orlando Bloom, while Buffalo Soldiers, a devilishly funny action-farce about the highly illicit activities of American soldiers on a German army base in the 1980s, was shelved for a year in the wake of 9/11.</p> <p>His latest, The Informers, which as yet has no release date, ought to do a bit better. Featuring a stellar cast that includes the much-missed Winona Ryder, Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger and Billy Bob Thornton, it's an adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's eponymous 1994 collection of linked short stories about a seductive and chillingly nihilistic early 80s Los Angeles.</p> <p>Easton Ellis has been pretty fortunate on the big screen so far, with both American Psycho and Roger Avary's highly under-rated Rules of Attraction making the jump in style (Less than Zero ... not so much). Check out the red band trailer (that means some Not Work Safe nudity, people) above or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xfx9ohZxvw\">here</a> and let us know what you think.</p> <p>As an aside, given that it was also used in a nightclub scene in Buffalo Soldiers, we're guessing that Jordan really, really likes New Order's Blue Monday.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.gadling.com/2007/03/06/glamping-and-other-puzzling-trends-in-travel/\">Glamping</a> is bullshit. No, seriously, isn't it? If you can't leave town without your <a href=\"http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=243-11-99-1&amp;cid=Homeware1&amp;pcidl=Clearance%2CHomeware1&amp;language=\" en-gb\" \">Cath Kidston tent</a> then, frankly, don't leave town. </p> <p>Much ink-space has been given over in the Sunday supplements this season to the rise and rise of \"<a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/active/article2320247.ece\">glamorous camping</a>\". Blame it on the credit crunch, or rejoice at the rejection of flights for a fiver. Trend-seekers pronounce that sleeping under canvas has lately become hip.</p> <p>But only because it's now possible to make your site look like a page from a <a href=\"http://www.boden.co.uk/\">Boden catalogue</a>. Glamping is about all about bespoke tents, blow-up sofas and tealight-strewn gazebos (check out that fire hazard). Glampers don't do dirt or, one imagines, rain. </p> <p>This completely misses the point. If you fancy remote luxury, check into a hotel \u2013 it's 2008 and there are plenty of chi-chi venues in inaccessible spots around the country. But please don't bring your scented candles and beaded throws next to my pitch. Because camping is not about reinforcing your groovy lifestyle aesthetic in the great outdoors. It's about precisely the opposite. At best, it demands that you check out of your usual routine, negotiate the lack of hairdryers, accept that sausages take longer to cook over a Calor gas stove, and learn how to pee discreetly in the bushes.</p> <p>By all means, take advantage of the manifest advances in roll-mat technology. Holidays aren't meant to be uncomfortable, and I'm no advocate of ascetic travel. But spare me the conspicuous consumption, when a pared down experience is part of the fun. How else are you going to discover that pine cones make great pan scourers? That's why they're called inner resources, people. Last week, I camped with friends in south Wales. There was nothing remotely glamorous about our set-up, but we managed a reasonable barbecue, and the kids we were with didn't stop hopping with excitement until they went to bed each night. I hope that we instilled in them the joy of camping, pure and simple, rather than an expectation that there ought always to be champagne in the cooler bag. </p> <p>This week, I'll admit it's lovely to be sleeping in my own bed again and to have the facility to wash my hair when I want to. But I'm happy to forgo those quotidian pleasures occasionally in exchange for watching the sun rise over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhossili\">Rhossili beach</a>. In an age when practically everything we care about is co-opted by the market, let's not give it camping too. Let's stay unkempt and sausage-fed, and leave the swank to the Boden true believers.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Time:</strong> 10pm</p> <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> Around 150, and two thirds full.</p> <p><strong>The theme:</strong> Last year, Kirshen cancelled his Fringe show to appear on Last Comic Standing, a kind of comedians' X-Factor on American TV. This year he's come to tell us about the experience. \"It's like getting a massage from a burly man,\" he explains. \"I know it's doing me good, but I still feel a bit dirty.\"</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> As a child-sized Jewish maths graduate, Kirshen is not short of comic material. \"You should see me on a swing,\" he always used to say. And besides, he is a witty, witty man with some fine stories to tell - about trying to buy drive-through food without a car, for instance, or being asked to autograph a Texan fan's gun magazine.</p> <p><strong>Weak spot:</strong> The material is new, and Kirshen seems still to be building up his confidence in it. The jokes that don't work have not yet been cut, and many of the good ones rattle past at such pace that you feel he is not making the most of them. His rapport with the audience - always a strength in the past \u2013 begins to waver when he stumbles over some lines or is thrown completely by unexpected answers. \"I mean, who buys a Ryanair keyring?\" he asks incredulously at one stage, and is lost for words when a man in the audience admits to owning five. Later, when a woman comes back from the toilet, he looks momentarily more embarrassed than she does.</p> <p><strong>Audience participation:</strong> Unpredictable \u2013 but then that's supposed to be the point. And I think he was hoping for more than one American in the crowd.</p> <p><strong>Comic equation:</strong> Woody Allen squared</p> <p><strong>Mark out of 10:</strong> 5</p> <p><strong>Put this on your poster:</strong> You can take the Matt out of America\u2026</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg has been suspended from all match officiating duties until further notice pending inquiries into reports of his alleged debts. Clattenburg is alleged to have run up debts relating to companies connected to him, forcing the Football Association and the refereeing body Professional Game Match Officials Ltd to act. The match official had been due to take charge of Sunday's FA Community Shield clash between Manchester United and Portsmouth, but has now been replaced by Peter Walton.</p> <p>With the new Premier League season due to start in nine days' time, Clattenburg will also not officiate in any other games until the issue has been resolved. \"PGMO is aware of media reports concerning alleged debts incurred by companies connected to referee Mark Clattenburg,\" read a joint statement from the Football Association and PGMO. \"It has been decided he will not officiate any matches pending enquiries into the background to these reports. </p> <p>\"The FA has also decided to appoint Peter Walton as referee for Sunday's FA Community Shield between Manchester United and Portsmouth in place of Mark Clattenburg.\" A PGMO spokesman added: \"It is in the best interests of Mark Clattenburg and the game that these reports are fully investigated and, during that time, he will not referee any matches. Mark Clattenburg is one of England's leading referees and we hope to resolve this matter swiftly.\"</p> <p>Clattenburg's firm MC Electrical Retail NE Ltd was wound up under the Insolvency Act on June 27, Newcastle county court confirmed. Friend John Hepworth took legal action in a bid to recover a debt reported to be almost \u00a360,000. In May Mr Hepworth served Clattenburg's firm with legal papers demanding \u00a359,589. When it failed to pay, he took the case to the county court and MC Electrical Retail NE Ltd was wound up.</p>",
  "<p>With the Chinese authorities preoccupied with the little matter of the Olympics kicking off tomorrow, they may not take too kindly to the news that Comedy Central's flagship series <strong>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</strong> is to despatch its \"senior foreign correspondent\" Rob Riggle to the country for the games. And we're not talking the Daily Show's usual green screen pisstaking here - Comedy Central promises the Riggle will actually be on location in China, as he was for a week in Iraq last summer, reporting from Tiananmen Square and the Great Wall of China as well as interviewing leaders in media and business in a series of reports entitled Rob Riggle: Chasing the Dragon, which kick off from Monday. \"Daily Show senior foreign correspondent Rob Riggle will provide in-depth coverage as the world gathers in China, Earth's only remaining superpower,\" Comedy Central said. UK viewers will be able to keep abreast of Riggle nightly on More4. To whet your appetite, check out Riggle in Iraq for what started out as Operation Silent Thunder, was then renamed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wkw8-fV1-s&amp;feature=related\">Operation Fluffy Bunny</a> and ended as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me2hFIvehes\">Operation Macho Kick-Ass</a>.

  "<p>Youngsters who commit minor criminal offences or get involved in antisocial behaviour should not face prosecution in the courts, the Liberal Democrats said today. </p> <p>Under the party's new youth-crime strategy, children who admit their guilt would be sent before panels of local people to apologise, with punishment in the form of a \"positive behaviour order\" and work such as cleaning up graffiti. </p> <p>The proposals also include the formation of a new youth volunteer force to carry out community projects and tougher penalties for shops that sell alcohol to children. </p> <p>In his foreword to the document, Chris Huhne, the party's home affairs spokesman, said that Labour had \"criminalised a generation of young people\". </p> <p>The plan would impose custody on youngsters \"only as a last resort\" and claims \"too many young people are being dragged through the criminal justice system for very minor offences\". </p> <p>Instead, community justice panels made up of local people ought to deal with low-level crimes, with youngsters explaining their actions and making a \"symbolic apology\", it says. </p> <p>The government's asbo regime should be used less frequently, the document states, and juveniles who breach an order should not face custody. </p> <p>The party also called for a greater use of restorative justice programmes, so offenders could be forced meet victims and see the consequences of their crimes. </p> <p>In a bid to prevent crime, shops that sell alcohol to under-18s could face being stripped of their licence at the first offence. </p> <p>Cannabis would remain a class C drug (the government is reclassifying it as class B early next year), which the Liberal Democrats claimed would allow police to concentrate on more serious crimes. </p> <p>Gun- and knife-crime hotspots should be targeted with high-profile policing, with extensive use of intelligence-led stop-and-search powers. </p> <p>The party called for a police community support officer (PCSO) within every neighbourhood team to be dedicated to working with local youngsters. </p> <p>The proposals also include \"junior PCSO\" and \"police cadet\" schemes to improve the relationship between youngsters and the authorities. </p> <p>Huhne said: \"If we want to tackle the problem of youth crime, we need to take action early to stop kids from embarking on a life of crime before it's too late. </p> <p>\"The old parties are falling over each other trying to be tough on crime, but nothing is being done do stop young people getting sucked in to a cycle of crime. </p> <p>\"Ministers know that programmes to divert kids away from crime work, and are even happy to promote such projects. </p> <p>\"However, they have failed to fund them properly in favour of punitive policies that grab headlines but achieve little. </p> <p>\"It is time for a new approach to youth justice which both prevents crime and confronts young people with their actions if they do break the law.\"</p> <p>Huhne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was spending 11 times more public money on locking young people up than on preventative measures. </p> <p>And commitments to providing playing fields and other sporting facilities were being \"honoured in the breach\" - with less than half the promised spending being invested. </p> <p>\"If you are locked up at a young age you will effectively be given a ticket to the college of crime and you will come out committing worse offences later than you would have done if you weren't in there. </p> <p>\"This is completely ineffective and we need to have a system which makes sure kids don't enter into a life of crime,\" he said. </p> <p>\"If we want to make sure the devil does not make work for idle hands to do, we have to take seriously these diversionary activities to get young people involved so they have something to do which is not going to lead to vandalism, graffiti, antisocial behaviour, all the things that are the first stepping stones into a life of crime.\"</p>",
  "<p>To date the Team England line on Kevin Pietersen's elevation to the twin-pronged Test and one-day captaincy has been plumped with non-specific optimism, but notably lacking in gushing superlatives. The fact is nobody, not even Pietersen, really knows what to expect from all this. Alastair Cook, presented with both a new captain and a new partner in the Test match top-order, isn't about to depart from the familiar air of guarded approval. But he seems less than certain what the future might hold.</p> <p>\"It's always different from just being in the side to taking over,\" he says, taking a bite of lemon meringue pie at a sponsors' event that must have seemed, prior to the captaincy storm, like it might have been a chance for some between-Tests down-time. \"It's a lot of responsibility and Kevin hasn't done that much captaincy. But so far everything he has done, people have questioned whether he can do it and he always comes up with the answers.\"</p> <p>Cook has more locus standi on the captaincy issue than you might expect for someone who has been around international cricket for just 2\u00bd years. In that time he's seen six different England skippers: Michael Vaughan, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Strauss, Andrew Flintoff, Marcus Trescothick (Cook was 12th man for the 2005 Test against Pakistan in Multan) and Pietersen, during the one-day international defeat by New Zealand at Lord's in June. Right now he seems most preoccupied with how the new skipper might affect the delicate balance of personalities in the dressing room.</p> <p>\"Vaughanie and Kevin are completely different characters,\" he says. \"It's going to be interesting. None of us have ever been under his leadership. It's weird. It's all change. It's been a very turbulent time for English cricket.\"</p> <p>In a break with recent tradition, a certain amount of this turbulence has come from inside the team bubble. Vaughan's watertight relationship with Duncan Fletcher was key to his pre-2005 successes. Pietersen was reduced to having what have been described as \"crisis talks\" with Peter Moores before taking on the captaincy. Does Cook think his new skipper is going to be able to forge that bond of trust which is key to success on the field?</p> <p>\"That's the important question,\" he says, without offering much in the way of an answer. \"There's no doubt about it. That's the challenge. Kevin is from a different mould to Vaughanie as player and as a personality. He's very outspoken in the dressing room. It could be a real shake-up for the side\".</p> <p>From his first appearances in the team Cook himself has been routinely described as a future England captain. A major obstacle right now is his inability to convince as a one-day player, something that hindered Andrew Strauss's claims this time around. Has this thrown into focus Cook's own need to develop that side of his game?</p> <p>\"You always look to develop, of course, although I was leading run-scorer the last two series on tour [against New Zealand and Sri Lanka], so I must be doing something right,\" he points out. \"And obviously I'd love to be captain. It's a great honour. Hopefully it might come my way at some point.\"</p> <p>One thing Vaughan didn't manage to do as captain was bring the best out of his junior opening batsman. With the former skipper in the side Cook averaged below 40, without him 46.4. Cook is aware of this, but scoffs at any sense the two might be connected.</p> <p>\"You can't blame other people,\" he says. \"We batted together in the Test in Colombo and put on 200. It's not as if we don't like batting together. I've just had a bit of dip for six months. It's a challenge for me. I'm disappointed I haven't scored a hundred this summer but it's part of a learning process. I'm just a 23-year-old player. People say you don't do your best batting until your early 30s.\"<br> Ian Bell will fill the vacancy at No3 for now. It's a position Cook has had success in himself, averaging 52 there in seven Tests. For now he's very happy to carry on opening, something he sees as huge technical and mental challenge. The Australian attack in the Ashes whitewash of 2006-7 is still the best he has faced. </p> <p>\"They all had so much control,\" he says. \"They never let you get away at any stage in any game. Even when I scored a hundred in Perth it was a real fight all the way through. Shame I didn't do it more often over there. But the pressure they put on you on quite flat wickets was exceptional.\"</p> <p>One criticism of Cook's development to date has been his slightly restricted range of shots, something occasionally exposed by a top-class attack. This summer his wonderfully full-blooded pull shot has been put to good use at times against an aggressive South African attack. It's a shot he's always been comfortable playing.<br> \"I think some people are just better at playing some shots naturally. For some reason my eyes pick up the short ball quicker, so it becomes a natural shot to hit. I was quite short as a youngster so I had to pull a lot of balls. Maybe that's got something to do with it.\"</p> <p>Is there any chance we might yet see some of that calypso-style vim injected into some of his other attacking shots?</p> <p>\"Well, I'd rather hit a cover drive for four or a straight drive. But for me the crucial thing is not to go too far away from your basics that got you where you are\".</p> <p>Which is, as of this week, facing up to a four-pronged South African pace attack on the quickest pitch of the series at The Oval. It's an immediate challenge for a rejigged and, in recent times, widely maligned England top six.</p> <p>\"Sure, we'd have liked a longer break between Tests,\" Cook shrugs. \"But this is Kevin's chance to get us all together and stamp his own style on things. And I'm sure he'll do that.\"</p> <p><em>Email without boundaries: Get exclusive insight from the England cricket team direct to your mobile with TwelfthMan TeamTalk from Vodafone.

  "<p><strong>11am</strong> There's so much to report from Old Trafford that I really don't know where to start, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. First, it's sunny, going completely against the forecasts earlier this week, which suggested we'd be lucky to get any play on the first two days. Second, Jason Lewry is now officially the most successful left-arm bowler in Sussex history. Apparently he received a text message from his former new ball partner James Kirtley yesterday afternoon informing him that the three wickets he took with the new ball had nudged him past Jim Wood, another seamer who took 585 wickets for the county between 1936-55. Well done Jason, although a Lancashire curmudgeon has just pointed out that he still needs another 1,111 wickets to match the tally of the most successful Red Rose leftie of all time, <a href=\"http://content-www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/player/9223.html\">Johnny Briggs</a>, who went on to prove his longevity and versatility by playing Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street.</p> <p>The other major talking point here this morning is what might have been discussed when the long-serving Old Trafford groundsman Pete Marron ran into the captain Stuart Law and manager Mike Watkinson last night. This pitch might have been designed for the Sussex spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Ollie Rayner, with the latter admitting he couldn't believe his luck when he first saw it.</p> <p><strong>1pm</strong> James Tomlinson extended the gap to Steve Harmison at the top of the first division's leading wicket-taker charts this morning as Yorkshire added only 30 to their overnight score to be all out for 236, writes <em>Mike Averis at the Rose Bowl</em>. In seven overs this morning the 26-year-old took two for 14 - having David Wainwright caught behind for 25 off an inside edge and then benefiting from Matthew Hoggard's top-edged pull which Dimitri Mascarenhas took, running around to short mid-wicket. Tomlinson finished with five for 53 - his third \"five for\" of the season.</p> <p>It was his best figures - if not his best performance - since he took eight on a damp first-day track at Taunton in May, a performance which signalled the end of a five-year struggle to get a regular place in the Hampshire side.</p> <p>The other batsman dismissed today was Jacques Rudloph, head and shoulders the best of the Yorkshire bunch with 89, who was caught behind - Nic Pothas's second fine catch of the morning - wafting at a ball from Chris Tremelett. At lunch Hampshire were 42 without loss after 14 overs, Michael Brown on 25 and the home side showing far more urgency than Yorkshire managed yesterday.</p> <p><strong>1.12pm</strong> The best part of this morning has been watching Justin Langer, the Somerset captain, kicking the turf, double-teapotting and ripping his cap off in frustration as Nottinghamshire extended their advantage in this match, reports <em>Paul Weaver at Taunton</em>. Somerset have been transformed over the past two summers by Langer and Brian Rose, the club's director of cricket, and their priority is to win the championship for the first time in their history.</p> <p>If they fail to do so they may be a weaker side by next year. Andrew Caddick will be 40 then, if he's still at the club, and it's almost unthinkable that he may not be around. And Langer himself will be 38. Even with rain around it's difficult to see this match ending in a draw and Notts, with a first innings lead of 124, have an important lead, though Langer and Marcus Trescothick reduced it with some thumping batting just before lunch.</p> <p>Notts resumed on 185 for six and Somerset made excellent progress. Mark Ealham, Andre Adams and Darren Pattison were all out without scoring as the championship leaders slumped to 193 for nine. But there was then a last-wicket stand of 37 between Chris Read and Charlie Shreck. Read, to Langer's horror, was badly dropped on the deep midwicket boundary by Steffan Jones when the score was 197. Read went on to make an unbeaten 71 in a score of 230 and was well supported by Shreck.</p> <p>Langer over-played his displeasure. A captain needs to be more positive than this. But he made up for it then. When Somerset went in again they made a positive start and they had 50 on the board after eight overs when they came off for lunch. Langer had 34 and Trescothick 16. But Trescothick has played the shot of the innings so far, a huge six over midwicket and out of the ground.</p> <p><strong>2pm</strong> Chris Nash has grafted to the first half-century of the match and therefore kept Sussex on course for a first innings lead, writes <em>Andy Wilson at Old Trafford</em>. They've just lost Murray Goodwin caught behind off Glen Chapple but with Nash still there on 59, they're well-placed on 110 for three in reply to Lancashire's 206. Chapple, Dominic Cork and Sajid Mahmood have all bowled pretty well on a pitch offering them nothing like as much encouragement as it did to the Sussex spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Ollie Rayner on the first day, but Nash, who may well have been dropped for this game if Michael Yardy hadn't suffered a bizarre injury, has shown impressive application. In case you're wondering Yardy suffered shoulder damage when team-mate Carl Hopkinson gave him an innocuous squeeze in a hotel bar.</p> <p><strong>3.45pm</strong> The threat of relegation took a firm hold at the Rose Bowl this afternoon, Hampshire taking 34 overs to eke out 83 in the sunshine, reports <em>Mike Averis</em>. Matthew Hoggard's second spell of six overs cost him just five runs as Anthony McGrath rotated his quicks, leaving Adil Rashid to bowl uphill and into what breeze there was. From 42 without loss - at about three an over - Michael Brown and Michael Carberry took the score to 82 before Brown attempted to sweep the wrist spinner. Rashid was bowling around the wicket but Neil Mallender must have thought the googly had turned enough to the right hander and Brown was gone for 45 off 81 deliveries.</p> <p>Sean Ervine was dropped at first slip, off Hoggard, and then lifted David Wainwright over mid-wicket for the first six of the game to bring up the 100, which (temporarily) got the blood flowing until Carberry's dismissal with the score on 109. The former Surrey and Kent opener had looked solid enough, leaving anything outside the off-stump until, on 46 from a patient 124 deliveries he nibbled at a ball from Rana Naved and was caught at the wicket. At tea Hampshire were 125 for two and moving a lot slower than the traffic on the M27.</p> <p><strong>4.10pm</strong> Sussex are in complete control at Old Trafford thanks to contrasting innings by Chris Nash and Matt Prior, says <em>Andy Wilson</em>. Nash's 108, a maiden first class century, has underpinned a total of 245 for five - already a lead of 39, with plenty of power to add - but it was Prior who really took the game away from Lancashire with some exhilarating strokes in a knock of 73 from 98 balls. He timed the ball beautifully from the start, seemed to middle virtually everything, but undermined that good work by driving loosely at Steven Croft shortly after Nash's dismissal. Croft was good value for those two wickets for his nagging medium pace, providing some much-needed control after Gary Keedy had taken some nasty punishment.</p> <p><strong>5.15pm</strong> There's going to be no more play from here today, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Taunton</em>. It's been raining hard from mid-afternoon and the umpires called it off at 5pm. But Somerset have made a good comeback in the 44.5 overs that were bowled.</p> <p>They conceded a lead of 124 after bowling Notts out for 230 but in the 27.5 overs available to them they have knocked off all but 10 of those, so there is much to play for over the next couple of days. At 114-0 this match is in the balance but Notts will still fancy their chances in the morning if they manage to dismiss Somerset's classy openers early on. Langer reached his fifty first, from 64 balls with eight fours. But Trescothick wasn't far behind, off 80 balls with seven fours and a six. It could a thriller. If the rain stays away.</p> <p><strong>6.30pm</strong> The battle at the bottom was turned on its head in one session when Yorkshire's 20-year-old wrist spinner Adil Rashid returned career-best figures of seven for 117, <em>writes Mike Averis at the Rose Bowl</em>.</p> <p>The sides finished with first innings scores level, but Yorkshire will return to the Rose Bowl tomorrow feeling favourites to move further away from the relegation zone if only because Hampshire bat last on a wicket which is not only showing turn but also occasional uneven bounce.</p> <p>Rashid, who announced himself at Scarborough two years ago with six wickets against Warwickshire, wrapped up the Hampshire innings with six wickets in 14 overs after tea.</p> <p>At 109 for one - Michael Brown having been Rashid's first victim, lbw sweeping for 45 - and then 125 for two at the break, Hampshire were looking for a decent first innings lead although runs were hard to come by. Sean Ervine, dropped on one, even got the blood coursing by lofting Rashid over mid-wicket for his second six before Rashid began the rot with two wickets in two deliveries. Former Yorkshire collegue Michael Lumb, padding up, was given out caught by Adam Lyth at silly point and Chris Benham failed to read the goodly, shouldered arms and was lbw.</p> <p>The Rashid-Lyth combination also did for Nic Pothas, again sweeping. The wicket keeper, in form after a lacklustre start to the season, was furious - either at himself or at umpire Neil Mallender's decision. Either way, Hampshire were 181 for six, Ervine having been stumped by half the length of the pitch as he danced out to David Wainwright.</p> <p>Dimitri Mascarenhas became the 23-year-old slow left arm bowler's second victim of the day - and only Wainwright's third of the championship season - when he also turned to the sweep, before Rashid picked up the wickets of Chris Tremlett, stumped trying to hit away to leg and Imran Tahir, whose prod ended at first slip.</p> <p>Fast bowlers David Balcombe and James Tomlinson added 38, but then Rashid wrapped up the day with the final-ball dismissal - an edge from Tomlinson looping to short leg.</p>",
  "<p>It is unlikely to command much airtime on Newsnight or worry leader writers on the Daily Telegraph, but Labour is already in the throes of a divisive leadership contest - to find a successor to Wendy Alexander as Scottish party leader. </p> <p>North of the Tweed, at least, that contest may yet determine the outcome of the next general election and with it Alex Salmond's boast of making Westminster \"dance to a Scottish jig\".</p> <p>And the search for the Scottish party's third leader in 18 months has led to precisely the kind of infighting you'd imagine Labour would want to avoid after their drubbing at Glasgow East.</p> <p>To the immense irritation of some backbenchers at Westminster, one of the three contestants - the former health minister Andy Kerr - wants the next leader to have real control of the party in Scotland, including authority over Labour's 38 Scottish MPs. </p> <p>Already alarmed by this empire building, MPs were enraged after one of Kerr's backers, the former Holyrood finance minister Tom McCabe, accused some comrades in the Commons of being \"arrogant\" and \"in denial\" about the scale of their difficulties. </p> <p>In return, MPs accuse Kerr of wanting to create the \"SNP mark two\".</p> <p>Labour's parliamentary group at Holyrood exists in a peculiar bubble within the UK party. While it energetically devolved significant legislative powers to the new Scottish parliament in 1998, Labour failed to do so internally. Its Scottish leader is just group leader at Holyrood; true power rests with the UK leader - Brown. </p> <p>Kerr believes this inhibits the Scottish party, prevents it from pursuing policies independent of London and allows it to be nimbly out-manoeuvred by the indefatigable Salmond (a case forcibly made before by Alexander).</p> <p>Since they know fine well that no possible Labour leader in Scotland can match Salmond's rhetorical skill or personal popularity, greater freedom on policy may be the only new tool it has. Waiting for Salmond's economic policies to unravel - as Kerr claims they surely will - may not be enough if Labour's unpopularity continues.</p> <p>Until the humiliation of losing Glasgow East, its third safest seat in Scotland, stopping Salmond from winning the next Holyrood election in 2011 by an even greater margin than last May's single seat had been Labour's chief objective in Scotland.</p> <p>But the task is now more urgent: Labour faces the very real prospect of losing other significant Scottish seats at the next general election - which comes first. </p> <p>The SNP's analysis of recent UK and Scottish opinion polls suggests that - for the first time in its history - it is ahead of Labour in the Westminster vote, by at least 6%.</p> <p>The nationalists are eyeing up prize seats such as Des Browne's Kilmarnock and Loudoun seat and, buoyed by the 22% swing in Glasgow East, gleefully claim that even Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Douglas Alexander are vulnerable. </p> <p>So too, to a more modest extent, are the Scottish Liberal Democrats. They too are choosing a new leader (recess? What recess?) and the stand-out favourite, Tavish Scott, claims they can take Edinburgh South, currently held by former minister Nigel Griffiths by a slender 405 votes over the Lib Dems.</p> <p>Bouyed by opinion polls suggesting they are just six points behind Labour in Scotland, even the Tories are eyeing up ministerial seats, including Alistair Darling's in Edinburgh South West and Jim Murphy's in East Renfrewshire. The Scottish party is already planning for the election, working to a \"100-week grid\" for its leader, Annabel Goldie.</p> <p>Kerr regrets McCabe's choice of words, but is holding his ground. He insists that Labour HQ in London - and by clear implication Gordon Brown - has to devolve authority to the Scottish party if it is serious about stopping Salmond's nationalist juggernaut in its tracks. </p> <p>Speaking after a lunchtime meeting with a cadre of 15 activists in rain-drenched Dundee yesterday, Kerr said: \"I'm probably the most ardent unionist in the Scottish parliament ... However, my political experience for the last 10 years or more is that Scots do want a different, distinctive Scottish voice to shout for them.\" </p> <p>McCabe too is unabashed. He claims a surge in support for Kerr after his critique: \"The tenor of the response is: 'Thank God someone has said it.'\"</p> <p>Funnily enough, the leadership hopeful seen as Brown's favoured candidate, the new Labour-ish former enterprise minister Iain Gray, disagrees with Kerr. His supporters insist that Kerr's stance has seen support from MPs swing sharply in Gray's direction. </p> <p>Compared to Kerr and the third contender, the old left candidate and long-serving deputy leader at Holyrood, Cathy Jamieson, Gray is the least experienced and least known. But the odds are narrowing on Gray winning the contest on September 13.</p> <p>The kicker is that in his four-year absence from Holyrood between 2003 and 2007, Gray was a special adviser at Westminster to Darling, Brown's closest ally in cabinet. </p> <p>He won 13 leadership nominations from fellow MSPs; Jamieson 12 and Kerr 10. Since he also claims backing from both Labour's Scottish MEPs, winning the Mps' contest (under Labour's convoluted electoral system, they have a third of the vote) could be decisive. </p> <p>Gray's people could point out that even when the Tories ruled Scotland in the 1990s with openly liberal policies at complete odds with John Major's government in London, that failed to stop the anti-Tory landslide. They still have only one MP in a kilt. </p> <p>\u0095 This is the first in a series of regular blog posts from Severin Carrell</p>",

  "<p>Last Saturday night Taliban militiamen burned down seven girls' schools in Pakistan, bringing the total they have torched in the last two months to 70.</p> <p>Just to be sure you got that: 70 girls' schools have been burned down by Islamist extremists in Pakistan over the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/world/south_asia/7543559.stm\">last two months</a>. I leave to you the task of totting up the other ways in which piety makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/22/womenandprogress\">war on women</a> in different parts and traditions of Islam, and not even very extreme Islam at that, ranging from honour killings to female circumcision and vaginal infibulation.</p> <p>Indeed I leave to you the not very congenial task of totting up the ways in which more enthusiastic forms of religion in general, not just Islam but Roman Catholicism, puritanical forms of Protestantism, and orthodox Judaism, have treated women: all the way from closeting them, covering the up, and silencing them, to sewing up their vaginas: it is a ghastly litany of repression, all the less excusable because discrimination against women which began in these ways persists in our society in modified forms: the fact that a woman earns about 70% of what an equally qualified and experienced man does is a residue in our own society of the attitude which in today's sharia law states that a woman is worth half a man.</p> <p>Radical movements of various kinds, including feminism, have set themselves the task of \"raising consciousness\" to help people see how they can be complicit in their own repression. When I hear or read an eloquent Muslim woman defending the headscarf or the more extreme forms of covering which, they say, are so liberating, I am reminded of that dangerous idea: the idea of complicity in one's own repression, the state of willingly accepting and enacting what the oppressor, or the oppressive mindset, dictates. They say the victim can come to love the torturer: there is a kind of freedom in that, one can imagine: there is certainly freedom of a sort in self-abnegation, in yielding responsibility to another, or to an ideology; just going along, not struggling, obeying.</p> <p>And if you burn down girls' schools so that the girls can know only what their elders and the world of a radius of a kilometre or two instructs them, how liberating for them to accept it all and do as they are told: yes indeed.</p> <p>I help finance a school in Africa. When first looking into doing so, I wanted to support a school <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/liberia.school\">for girls specifically</a>, because it is known how transformative a few years of elementary education can be for women and their children in developing countries. On the best authority in the world I was advised not to encourage schooling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/journalismcompetition/impact.educating.girls\">for girls alone</a>, because the boys and men in their communities would resent them and beat them, and they would suffer worse as a result. As the late Kurt Vonnegut would say: so it goes. So in the school I support, boys and girls \u2013 in a Muslim community \u2013 go to school together. There is no religious indoctrination in that school, just maths and geography and such.</p> <p>And by the way, if you are interested to know why, in Africa, almost all girls drop out of education at puberty, one reason is the lack of sanitary provision \u2013 the mere absence of a circle of sticks for privacy. But that is not the only reason: there are plenty more barriers, from taboos to early marriage, which in some communities is indistinguishable from a form of slavery. Tradition and religion between them \u2013 such partners \u2013 make shackles of iron. And the shackles are mainly worn by women. They are forged as much in the fires that burn down girls' schools as in the cool conceit of those who celebrate the fact that an iron shackle can look like a piece of cloth draped over a head.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Morning</strong> Rob will be here from around 10.45am. In the meantime, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/07/my_message_to_kp_stay_positive.html\">here</a> is Duncan Fletcher's message to KP.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. Just as David Brent doesn't give <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdHoQ_Lraoo\">rubbish jobs</a>, so England and South Africa don't really do dead rubbers. Of the 31 Tests since South Africa's readmission, 30 have been during a live series \u2013 and Hansie Cronje managed to inject some context into the eyeballs of the 31st, the contrived finish at Centurion in 1999-2000. Now the 32nd, ostensibly a dead rubber, has been infused with fresh breath by the appointment of Kevin Pietersen as England captain.</p> <p>Whether <em>he</em> will be a breath of a fresh air is up for debate. I was against his appointment, mainly because of the impact it will surely have upon his baHE'SNOTROBERTKEYISTHEMAINPOINTtting. In his sole game as England captain so far, the ODI against New Zealand, he seemed weighed down by how a captain should be <em>seen</em> to bat, making 6 from 23 balls. The instinct that so is fundamental to his batting was squashed.</p> <p>For now, however, a repeat of Nasser Hussain's pair in victory on this ground in 2000 would do nicely. However cosmetic it might be, England desperately need a result. If they lose, it will be the first non-Ashes summer since 1988 in which they have lost three Tests. The statistical evidence against Peter Moores and the shower whose temperature he controls is already sadly damning. The last time England lost home series in consecutive years, for example, was 1997; the last time they did so when neither series involved Australia was 1987. In nine Tests against decent opposition under Moores, they have yet to win a match, or even take 20 wickets.</p> <p>This is surely England's worst team since 1999, and the fact that they come to the Oval talking up the potential significance of what would be a meaningless victory in the context of the series is another indication that we are back to those bad old 90s days of unremitting mediocrity. </p> <p>The overwhelming emotion is not anger or even frustration so much as a bittersweet sadness, like when you look in someone's eyes and recognise that you no longer love each other, and never well. And a showy, sexy frock imported from South Africa won't change that. Can't fight fate. Yet it's not even three years since September 12 2005, the day we swapped hearts for eternity. How did it come to this?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Pitchwatch</strong> While it's not as slow as it was around the turn of the century, it's still ladyboy-flat and high scores have predominated in recent years. But overhead conditions can make a difference, the most notable example being the fourth day of the 2005 Ashes Test, and with it looking a bit funky overhead in London there might just be a temptation to bowl first.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Graeme Smith wins the toss and bats first</strong> I'll shut up then.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The teams</strong> South Africa are unchanged; England are a shower.</p> <p>England: Cook, Strauss, Bell, Pietersen (c, MBE, OBE, BA HONS), Collingwood, Flintoff, Ambrose (LCS), Broad, Harmison, Anderson, Panesar.</p> <p>South Africa: Smith (c), McKenzie, Amla, Kallis, Prince, de Villiers, Boucher (wk), Morkel, Harris, Nel, Ntini.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Our warmest congratulations</strong> go to OBO groupie Andy Bradshaw, whose first born, Dylan Richard, came into the world this week.

Just asking, like.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 0, McKenzie 0)</strong> <br>So the story begins. No on-field huddle, an innovation (sic) that won't be at all missed. And Harmison has Smith dropped off the first ball of the match! What a start: it was short, jagging away a touch, and Smith slapped it straight to gully where Cook, crouching, dropped what was by Test standards a sitter. </p> <p>Overall it's an excellent over from Harmison: the fourth ball lifts to rattle Smith in the breadbasket, and the fifth swings back to take the inside edge and fly into the babymaker. Smith hits the canvas and Harmison smiles for the first time since 2005. Then off the last ball, Ambrose contrives to punch it into his own mouth after it lifted late; there's a bit of blood but no dentistry issues; no teeth rattling everywhere like confetti.</p> <p>\"Just wondering if the England shower you mention is for Andy Bradshaw's new nipper, Dylan Richard,\" honks Chris Brock. \"Ahem.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (Smith 1, McKenzie 0)</strong> Jimmy Anderson - who isn't the subject of that great M.I.A. song, contrary to no reports whatsoever - starts at the other end and shapes one past Smith's outside edge. I think there's been some shape out there! When McKenzie gets on strike he does what he does: nothing, watching the ball go past off stump or, if it gets too close, defending diligently. He's an admirable fellow, this McKenzie. Saying which, he aims an airy-fairy pull at the last delivery, quite wide of off stump, and fresh-airs it.</p> <p>\"Isn't it because Banger had a note from the doctor, and Grievous Bodily never got one?\" honks Tom Walling.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 6-0 (Smith 2, McKenzie 3)</strong> McKenzie, trying to leave at the last minute, drags Harmison just wide of his off stump, and then pulls his bat away from a ball that lifts nastily. Then McKenzie mistimes another leave, this time steering it on the bounce to second slip, before pushing through the covers for three. There is good kick in this pitch; it seems to have more life than it did last year, when India batted two days for about 1,450.</p> <p>\"Banger knew he had issues, and, despite the risk to his central contract, put the team first and withdrew,\" says Leo Carroll. \"Harmy on the other hand, despite obviously having real problems with being away from his family, continues to turn up in body but not spirit, and ends up bowling like a drain for two years before being dropped.\" But couldn't you argue he puts the team first by going on tour in the first place? The easy option would be to not turn up. I am not, in any way, criticising Trescothick here; I just think we are too harsh on Harmison.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 7-0 (Smith 2, McKenzie 4)</strong> Bit of a nothing over from Anderson. </p> <p>\"In the interviews immediately after the toss, I take it that KP first obliged the home broadcasters, then the South African broadcasters, perhaps in Afrikaans?\" says Gary Naylor. \"That he can switch-hit in languages too is rather impressive.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 7-0 (Smith 2, McKenzie 4)</strong> This is good stuff from Harmison, who is grooved, hitting the pitch hard (top pace is around 88mph) and even getting the odd delivery to swing away from the right-hander. It's a maiden.</p> <p>Here's Richard Smyth. \"If \"we\" don't have sympathy for Steve Harmison after all he's done for us (the anticipatory thrill of that vulpine, baggy-shirted run-up, his Windies carnage, that first-day spell to Ponting and Langer, That Slower Ball To Michael Clarke) then it can only be because \"we\" are a*holes who like to spout guff about \"character\" and \"guts\" (because \"we\" secretly imagine that we have far more guts and character than he does, if only we had been lucky enough to have his god-given talent, or, as Mike Selvey prefers to call it, \"height\"). In sum, I love Steve Harmison more than a man should love another man.\" I know that feeling: it stirs every time I watched Anderson's penalty in the Champions League final.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 8-0 (Smith 3, McKenzie 4)</strong> The over-rate is redefining funereal - six in over half an hour - mainly because of problems behind the bowler's arm and problems with Ambrose's molars. The first ball of Anderson's over pins Graham Smith in front of middle, but it pitched a long way outside leg and Steve Davis barely bothers to shake his head. Smith then chops a cut back past his off stump. South Africa haven't got the pace of this pitch yet; while it's not <em>quick</em>, I think it's taken them by surprise. </p> <p>\"Andrew Miller just challenged you to a game of Word Twist,\" writes Word Twist. Be back in five. You kids'll be okay on your own, won't you?</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 4, McKenzie 5)</strong> Opposite me, Sam Collins is doo-doo-dooing the Violent Femmes, just what you need on a Thursday morning. Smith tucks Harmison off his hip for a single, and it's all pretty sedate stuff at the moment. South Africa will be happy to bat time until lunch, after which this pitch should lose some of its zing.</p> <p>\"Is it because Trescothick has admitted to his problems openly, sought treatment and generally acted unselfishly?\" asks Rachel Clifton. \"And Harmison has never admitted having problems, appears to be truculent and sulky, and post the Ashes debacle, gave the impression of needing to be told what was wrong with his game, rather than taking any responsibility for what had happened?\" Or, as Tim Canterbury says, is it Buckaroo?</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 14-0 (Smith 4, McKenzie 7)</strong> Anderson, as Collins opposite me observes, is still a touch too short - this has been the case for a while now, as part of the attempt to make him a more complete bowler. Which is fine, but in attempting to do so they killed the golden arm. South Africa are eschewing risk now, which is sensible because it's clammy overhead and nipping around a touch. It would nip around a lot more if someone pitched it up. Get Collingwood on.</p> <p>Alexander Netherton has sent an email to the wrong address: mine. \"Kathryn, one word: biological clock,\" it reads. This is brilliant. I'm forwarding it onto everyone. If only he'd attached a bongo pic of himself, the story would be in London Lite this evening. Good paper, that. <em>Free</em>.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 14-0 (Smith 4, McKenzie 7)</strong> Harmison shapes one back to pin McKenzie in front of middle on the back foot, but it was bouncing well over the top and Aleem Dar says no. The next ball takes a leading edge and goes to slip on the bounce. Credit where etc: Harmison has bowled very well this morning.</p> <p>Here's Ben Mimmack. \"Tresco is seen as genuinely ill, whereas Harmison is seen as mentally weak. The first elicits either sympathy or discomfort from the general population and is therefore not widely discussed. Perceived mental weakness on the other hand is used as a stick to beat someone whenever they play poorly. This is a bit heavy though, how about we discuss most hated cartoon characters from childhood. I'll vote for Snarf from Thundercats.\" Mine: Ian Rush, him from Milli Vanilli, and <em>Radio 1's Mark Goodier</em>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 19-0 (Smith 9, McKenzie 7)</strong> Anderson swings a length delivery across Smith's grope. Later in the over Smith gets the first boundary of the day, clipping Anderson crisply off his pads. In the commentary box Botham is blaming \"the previous regime\" (he can't bring himself to utter the words 'Duncan' and 'Fletcher') for Harmison's failings. What utter poppycock. When are people going to accept that Duncan Fletcher is the greatest coach England have ever had, followed by a whole load of daylight and arguably the best technical coach in the history of the game. The lack of respect we show the man is disgusting.</p> <p>\"Word Twist is very dangerous,' moral-panics Tom Wallins. \"I'm addicted, and I get struck down by the anagram flu all the time. Someone will say a word, for instance 'winsome', and I can't hear the rest of what they say because I'm immediately off: 'wins, some, snow, wine, wines...' Debilitating socially.\" I have the condition where, as I'm trying to get to sleep, I start playing Word Twist in my mind's eye. Used to happen with Tetris as well, until I started physically trying to twist the blocks when I was sharing a bed with a mate. Utter farce: injunctions, the lot. We don't speak anymore.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 27-0 (Smith 9, McKenzie 15)</strong> Harmison beats McKenzie with an absolute peach - fuller, vrooming away off the seam and still lifting enough for Ambrose to take it in front of his mouth. Mind you he'd take a grubber in front of his mouth. Honk. Honk. McKenzie responds with a superb, short-arm pull through midwicket for four, a strange but highly effective shot, and then he tucks four more to fine leg next ball. </p> <p>\"Really was not a fan of Dogtanian out of the Muskerhounds,\" says Tom Banks. Loved the other three but there was something deeply sinister about the flashing red-nosed one.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 32-0 (Smith 14, McKenzie 15)</strong> Flintoff is on for Anderson, and Smith pulls him authoritatively over midwicket for four. South Africa have had their sighter, adjusted to the pace of the pitch, and are enjoying themselves now. But Flintoff's response is a good one: he switches to around the wicket and seams one past Smith's outside edge. It's sseriosuly quite at the Oval, by the way. It's as if all the JCLs are learning the rules of cycling in preparation for watching Pendleton and that lot.</p> <p>\"Scrappy Doo wins this contest every time,\" says Marcus Littlejohns. How can anyone hate Scrappy Doo? That's one step away from introducing cute puppies to water.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 33-0 (Smith 15, McKenzie 15)</strong> Harmison has slipped his length up a touch, and then surprises Smith with a really short one that he ducks slightly desperately underneath. That will probably be Harmison's spell, and it's been a pretty good one: 7-3-15-0. Smith and McKenzie both have 15 from 40 balls, with two fours, and that's drinks.</p> <p>\"Are you kidding?\" says Richard Simpson. \"You really think we should have sympathy for a 29-30 year old sportsman who gets homesick? Is it just me that wants to call him a big jessie? Misses his family? Give me a break - he gets paid very well to play a game! If I ask my boss to go home becaise I miss the cat I'll be told to get back to my desk monkey job sharpish, or do one.\" Next week on Richard Simpson's Modern Man, why that lot must never - never - be allowed to leave the kitchen.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>KP watch</strong> It's difficult to discern a real sense of a captain's work from TV, but there has been no mention of anything unusual from the commentator's. He's set missionary-position fields - three slips, gully, etc - but there's no harm in that.</p> <p>Tonight's top story in the London Lite takes another twist. \"Tell Alex that that is in fact two words. And I'd rather spend the money on anti-wrinkle cream than a wedding,\" says Kathryn Oliver. Whatever next?</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 36-0 (Smith 17, McKenzie 16)</strong> Pollock, who knows a little bit more than me about bowling, also says England have been too short this morning. (Pollock is superb commentator by the way, isn't he? He does revolutionary stuff, like analyse the cricket.) Obviously the attack has three deck-hitters, but Anderson could definitely have shoved it further up. Anyway, it's Flintoff again, and not much happens. The sun is coming out, and South Africa will be booking in for at least a day and a half, I'd have thought.</p> <p>Here's Tim Kingston. \"Does anyone else remember Gideon the Duck?\" I thought that was something to do with the Yarras? \"He used to help out the other animals. In one episode he assisted his friends the fish by killing the fisherman \u2013 then, as was his wont at the conclusion of his adventure, he did a little song and dance to celebrate the murder.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 45-0 (Smith 26, McKenzie 16)</strong> Harmison continues, in fact, and Smith pulls his first two balls for four - the first witheringly through midwicket, the second sweetly through square leg. It looks like one over too many for Harmison and, to answer Lee Calvert's question, he's not the only one getting that \"South Africa 327-4 (Smith 147*)\" feeling. Looks a really good deck, this.</p> <p>In other news, it seems everyone does hate Scrappy Doo after all. Philistines.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 47-0 (Smith 28, McKenzie 16)</strong> Flintoff probes away on a length around Smith's off stump from around the wicket and then, when he pitches one up and a fraction wider, Smith reaches and snicks it very low to the left of Cook at third slip, who can't hold on to an unspeakable difficult chance. Technically Cook has dropped Smith twice; the two chances could barely have been of varying difficult, though. Excellent bowling. </p> <p>\"I'm grateful to Fletcher - he was a fine technical coach for batsmen, but his limitations as a bowling coach were exposed once Cooley shipped out,\" says Gary Naylor. \"England's bowling has been in crisis since. Despite Moores having an entourage of P Diddy proportions, I still can't see who is coaching Monty - and he really needs it! Whoever coaches the fielders isn't too impressive either.\" All sense from the great man, as ever. He once got something wrong, though - about the Romanians doing their hair blond at the 1998 World Cup - and we live in hope of a repeat.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 47-0 (Smith 28, McKenzie 16)</strong> Broad replaces Harmison. Bowling on this pitch will further his education, which is what England must do at every opportunity now that the forseeable future is a write off. The fourth ball is a beauty: on a length and curving beautifully past McKenzie's nervous grope. A good, discipline start from Broad: a maiden.</p> <p>\"My most hated cartoon character from childhood was Scooby Doo's all-American hero Fred 'Freddie' Jones,\" says John Thurstans. \"Mainly because he was going out with the delectable Daphne but also because he always got to unmask the villain even though Velma had been the one to work out who it was. Glory grabber.\" Yes, John did just use the phrase \"the delectable Daphne\" to describe a cartoon character. No, John Thurstans doesn't make eye contact with the fairer sex. Or even his own mother.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 47-0 (Smith 28, McKenzie 16)</strong> Bah. Smith, pushing at a leg-cutter from Flintoff, edges on the bounce to Collingwood at second slip. England have bowled decently this morning, within the fairly strong limits of their natural lengths, and that's a maiden.</p> <p>\"Combining Modern Man attitudes with kids TV, my dad has a misogynistic loathing for Sue from Sooty and Sweep who 'swanned in and ruined everything, twittering on and moaning all day like \"they\" do',\" says Chris Allen. \"He still refuses to watch anything Sooty related, despite repeats being a favourite with his grandsons.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 55-0 (Smith 35, McKenzie 17)</strong> It's a bit flat in more than one sense. But England are probing diligently and McKenzie, for the third time this morning, is late on a leave and flaps it off the face of the bat into the slips on the bounce. Later in the over, when Broad goes fuller, Smith pushes him through mid-off for a couple, and then he times four through extra-cover. That's the risk of going full. Smith is going well now, after being dropped off the first ball of the match.</p> <p>\"Look, let's get real,\" says Chris Bourne. \"The worst cartoon character is Mickey Mouse. Smug, squeaky, verminous. And has given his name to the England cricket team, as in - 'A Mickey Mouse cricket team'. He even has a long tail. Fact.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 56-1 (McKenzie c Cook b Flintoff 17)</strong> Flintoff, and England, deserve that. McKenzie leaned into a full, wide outswinger but could only slash it to third slip, where Cook held on two-handed above his head. He finally takes a catch at the third attempt, and McKenzie's unusually scatterbrained innings comes to an end.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 56-1 (Smith 36, Amla 0)</strong> \"According to Fletcher, Panesar turned up to England without an arm ball - so it appears not even his county is coaching him,\" says Lee Calvert. \"I am hoping KP will take the revolutionary step of letting his leading spinner set his own field and then encourage him to bowl with more aggression, or at least around the wicket a bit for a start.\" Problem is, Monty hasn't got a clue. Vaughan used a phrase to describe his field placings, something contemptuous like \"schoolboy fields\", which is why Vaughan had to set them for him. Nor can he really work batsmen out. That's fine in a 21-year-old with raw talent, but Monty is 26 and has been a Test player for 30 months. Maybe our expectations of spinners' brains are too high because of Warne, but still, the lack of development is alarming.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>21th over: South Africa 60-1 (Smith 40, Amla 0)</strong> Broad pitches it up and Smith, again, punches him crisply through the covers for four. Good shot.</p> <p>To misquote the Peep Show song, Michael Hunt is sick and he's not well. \"It has always struck me as strange why all the best looking cartoon girls are read-heads? The delectable Daphne for one, April from the Turtles, Ariel the little mermaid, Jessica Rabbit\u2026 the list goes on. Any suggestions?\" Sleep.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Rain stops play: South Africa 64-1 (Smith 40, Amla 4)</strong> Flintoff strays unusually onto leg stump and Amla flicks him for four almost absent-mindedly. One ball later they're off; I wasn't even aware it was raining, but it looks to be no more than a light shower - a tribute from the heavens to this England team.</p> <p>\"Can it be autumn already?\" muses Thomas Lawrence. \"Cause it seems McKenzie's leaves have fallen off...(I'm deeply sorry for this one).</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>So that's lunch</strong> They'll take it 15 minutes early, and resume at 1.25pm, whereupon John Ashdown will be here to hold your hand and tell you everything will be okay. Thanks for your emails - sorry for ignoring most of them.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Afternoon, all</strong>. The sun is out here in central London, with a salt-and-pepper candyfloss clouds dominating the horizon. And as I muse over that not-particularly-well-written piece of creative writing, Manchester City v Celtic v Manchester City pops up on the TV, sending me scrambling wildy through the channels to find Gower and co. Not a particularly good start.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 64-1 (Smith 40, Amla 4)</strong> <br>Flintoff bowls the one ball remaining in his over. Amla defends.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 65-1 (Smith 40, Amla 4)</strong> <br>Broad beats the bat with his first after lunch, Smith missing a drive by quite some distance. \"My money's Man City for that one, given that they have two teams out,\" writes Richard Graveling, highlighting the bizarre three-way friendly I came acroos earlier. Suffice to say, my mistake.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 65-1 (Smith 40, Amla 4)</strong> <br>Flintoff, who's pumped full of painkillers apparently (his toe hurts), continues to rumble in, but it's mostly far too wide. \"I spent last weekend in a caravan in rainy Cornwall explaining to my South African father-in-law why England getting beaten by SA and then appointing a South African as a captain didn't make me (and the rest of English manhood) some kind of effeminate half man freak,\" writes effeminate half man freak Tom Charnock. \"I desperately need some put downs for this weekend particularly if it all goes wrong again.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 66-1 (Smith 40, Amla 5)</strong> <br>I tell you what Tom, I'd be surprised if your father-in-law's countrymen can make a soup as tasty as the good old English onion version I'm eating now. Not that that's much of a comeback I know. Amla scampers a single of ball No5 from Broad, the first runs off the bat since lunch, then, <em>again</em>, Smith somehow fails to edge one that slides across him.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 71-1 (Smith 40, Amla 10)</strong> <br>Dropped! Amla edges Alastair Cook at third slip and, just as he did this morning, the England opener shells it. Again it wasn't straightforward - Amla was playing a firm stroke and a leaping Cook was stretching above his head - but it's another he should have held. Flintoff doesn't look happy, and no wonder</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 83-1 (Smith 40, Amla 22)</strong> <br>\"These four Test series are rubbish,\" writes Matt Delargy. \"Like a bride on her wedding night, I feel it's all over just when it's getting interesting and everyone is getting on a plane back to South Africa.\" Not sure if the analogy <em>fully</em> works there, Matt. Amla drives and gets a thick outside edge for four, then Broad strays onto the pads and is clipped away for four more. Then, ho hum, it's short and wide from the bowler and Amla cuts hard for another boundary. Broad strikes back with the last ball of the over, catching the edge, with the ball dropping a couple of yards short of the slips.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 87-1 (Smith 44, Amla 22)</strong> <br>Beautiful shot from Smith, pushing a full one from Flintoff straight down the ground for four. Two balls later and Smith is again beaten by one that moves a touch. That's three for the Saffers captain since lunch. \"Tom Charnock should tell his South African father-in-law that his grandchildren will be 50% effeminate half-man freak,\" writes Andrew Moore. \"That should do the trick.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 95-1 (Smith 44, Amla 30)</strong> <br>Amla strikes a pose as his thumping cover drive races to the boundary. And he follows it up with another for good measure. Andrew Gledhill, Nick Smith and Tom Morgan all write to question whether the slips are too far back, but the ball a couple of overs ago dropped well short, where no slip would dare to tread. And you could argue that Cook was a yard too far forward for his catch.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 100-1 (Smith 44, Amla 34)</strong> <br>Harmison returns and first up strikes Smith on the pad with the ball heading towards middle stump, half-way up. But it pitched <em>just</em> outside leg, so big Steve's vociferous appeal falls on deaf ears. Amla picks up another four, with a clip to leg that caught the leading edge and zipped to the boundary at long off.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 103-1 (Smith 46, Amla 36)</strong> <br>It's a double change, with Anderson coming back, and again Smith is fortunate to survive the first ball of the over. It's pitched up, Smith aims a juicy drive, but can only inside-edge the thing onto his back pad right in front of the stumps. He's led a charmed life since the break. Then it's Amla's turn to get lucky, Harmison narrowly missing with a shy at the stumps as the batsmen scurry a single. \"I can't think of anything worse than being trapped in a caravan with Tom Charnock's South African father-in-law,\" writes Tom Innes. \"Especially when the only two sports the Saffers care about are rugby (world champs after beating us in the final) and cricket (two-nil). Try to turn the spotlight towards their dismal record in the Olympics (43rd in the medals table in Athens), tennis (no players ranked above 109 in the world) or Morris Dancing.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Smith c Anderson b Harmison 46 (32nd over: South Africa 103-3 (Kallis 0, Prince 0)</strong> The out-of-sorts Smith attempts a hook but can only top edge to deep backward square leg. For a moment, I'm sure there's a groan from those in the crowd expecting to see Panesar underneath it, but, fortunately for the home fans, it's Jimmy Anderson. The batsmen crossed while the ball was in the air so it's Amla to face and oh my! <strong>WICKET! Amla b Harmison 36</strong>. It's not quite a yorker, but Amla is beaten for pace and the middle stump is sent cartwheeling away. Hat-trick ball for Harmy ... bah! Prince defends comfortably. That's certainly woken the crowd up.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Kallis 2 lbw b Anderson (33rd over: South Africa 109-4 (Prince 0, De Villiers 4)</strong> <br>Another big appeal as Anderson beats the edge with Kallis fending. Ambrose says yes. Umpire says no. Two balls later Anderson swings one back in, catching Kallis flush on the pad. Anderson says yes, umpire says yes! That was a fantastic ball from Anderson. This is a proper collapse. \"As a Saffer and a Proteas fan, I'd like to ease back on the nationalist fervour and soothe Tom Charnock's pain with the following truism,\" writes William Smook. \"It's not much fun being in a caravan with one's father-in-law at the best of times.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 109-4 (Prince 0, De Villiers 4)</strong><br>South Africa are rocking here - Harmison bangs one in short and Prince is hopping and gloving the ball into space at short square leg. Next up, the new Notts man is beaten by pace \u00e0 la Amla, but this one fizzes narrowly wide of the off stump.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 113-4 (Prince 0, de Villiers 8)</strong><br>Anderson is getting plenty of swing, with de Villiers prodding and poking outside off. One thick edge rattles away for four, but Anderson won't mind that too much. He, and England, have got their tails up.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 117-4 (Prince 4, de Villiers 8)</strong><br>Prince misses with an ungainly flail at a Harmison bouncer, which Ambrose does very well to stop bounding away for four byes. He gets hold of the next one, though even then it's not straight out of the middle, for four welcome runs. \"Vaughan must be thinking, 'If only I'd had Harmison to throw the ball to instead of Pattinson, I might still be England captain..'\" writes Andy Killeen.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Prince 4 c Bell b Anderson (37th over: South Africa 118-5 (de Villiers 9, Boucher 0)</strong><br>And South Africa's collapse shows no sign of abating. This time it's a poor shot from the usually circumspect Prince. Anderson pitches one up, finds a thick outside edge and Bell takes a regulation catch at point. Well, well ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 123-5 (de Villiers 14, Boucher 0)</strong><br>From 103-1 to 118-5 in six overs. Looking at the dimissals, Kallis and Amla both got good ones (though Amla did seem to play round his), while Smith and Prince played pretty poor shots. There's a little bit of movement from the pitch, but you feel it's England's momentum, provided by Harmison's removal of Smith and Amla in two balls, that is creating pressure on the batsmen. \"Is it just me or has Kallis had a pretty terrible tour (by his standards)?\" writes Tom Morgan. \"His scores this series are 7, 13, 4, 64, 5 and 2.<br>Pity the England bowlers haven't worked everyone else out as well as<br>him.\" <a href=\"http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerBatGraph.asp?PlayerID=2043\">The big man has certainly had a fairly lean time of late</a>.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 123-5 (de Villiers 15, Boucher 0)</strong><br>Anderson again threatens, moving the ball both ways (not at the same time, obviously). With his final ball he finds the edge of Boucher's bat, but it drops short of a diving Collingwood. There are those words again.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 127-5 (de Villiers 16, Boucher 2)</strong><br>\"In response to Andrew Killeen's comment,\" writes Andrew Benson, \"I think Vaughany's laments should read 'If only our coaches, physios and doctors had done their job and realised Sidebottom was crocked \u2013 I could've thrown the ball to Harmison at Edgbaston\u2026' Imagine him bowling out of that sightscreen!\" Good stuff from the batsmen, working the singles cleverly.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 131-5 (de Villiers 20, Boucher 2)</strong><br>Kallis was Anderson's 100th Test wicket, by the way, not bad for a man who's spent so much time in the international peripheries. De Villiers thumps one back past the bowler from the penultimate ball of the over.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 132-5 (de Villiers 20, Boucher 3)</strong><br>Flintoff returns and joins the party, flashing a couple past Boucher. It's all a little wide, though. \"Erm, shouldn't not-so-flyin' Ryan have realised he was<br>injured himself?\" suggests Rory Taylor, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Boucher 3 c Ambrose b Anderson (43rd over: South Africa 132-6 (de Villiers 20, Morkel 0)</strong><br>Anderson produces an absolute peach, swinging away from Boucher, who's attempting a clip to leg. What a ball that was - it's earned him five balls at Morne Morkel. The first is wide, the second is left (but swings in to miss the bails by<em>inches</em>), the third also left (again swinging back), the fourth a bouncer, the last raps the batsman on the pad. With Anderson and co bowling this well, de Villiers will need to farm the strike obsessively.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 137-6 (de Villiers 21, Morkel 4)</strong><br>The cameras pick up John Motson in the crowd, prompting Bumble in the Sky commentary box to offer perhaps the worst Motty impression I've ever heard.<br>\"Great stuff this afternoon,\" writes James Smith. \"If we can just get Stuart Broad to give up on pace bowling and bowl anodyne slow left arm, we can drop Monty, bring in Simon Jones and we might have a good outfit here.\" De Villiers leaves Morkel with three to face, and from his second he's lucky to survive after an inside edge jags just over the stumps, just short of Ambrose, and down to the boundary. The last ball zips through the gate.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 141-6 (de Villiers 25, Morkel 4)</strong><br>De Villiers begins his counter-attack - hacking a short, wide one over point for four, then larrupping one into the covers that Broad does well to stop. \"So, how on God's green Earth are we to explain this sudden bowling <br>improvement?\" wonders Ben Richardson. \"Has new Capt'n KP threatened that he'll start dying that ludicrous stripe into his hair if his team lose again? Is it his aggressive Saffa approach to leading the line? Or is it just having a chance to bowl on a track that isn't stultifying benign? Or just South Africa not giving two figs about this dead rubber?\" Perhaps a little from column A, a little from column B.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 143-6 (de Villiers 25, Morkel 6)</strong><br>Hmm. Not the best from Flintoff - wide and unthreatening. He seems to be having a few problems with his boots, so he's heading off for a change.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 148-6 (de Villiers 30, Morkel 6)</strong><br>Broad comes back and serves up a half-volley that de Villiers is only too happy to thump through the covers. It's dross, but he does offer a reminder of his potential with a couple of really good away-swingers later on in the over. Then spoils it by offering up another half-volley. Ah, well.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 149-6 (de Villiers 31, Morkel 6)</strong><br>Morkel takes one in the ribs from Flintoff, but only threatens with an attempted yorker last up. \"Re. over 45. It may be a dead rubber, but do you think there's a Saffa in the side who wants to give KP a first Test victory?\" wonders Angus Doulton. Nope, but the Oval crowd do seem very flat. It may be that it's a dead rubber, it may be the oncoming footy season, or the Olympics, but it seems to be a struggle to get too excited about all this, even with KP making his debut with the metaphorical armband.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 157-6 (de Villiers 39, Morkel 6)</strong><br>I know de Villiers is looking to attack but this is still pretty dire stuff from Broad. AB flails another short one through the covers, then hammers one back over the bowler's head. And, again, Broad produces a decent one that beats the bat by way of a comeback. Crikey, he's a frustrating bowler to watch.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! De Villiers 39 lbw b Panesar (50th over: South Africa 158-7 (Morkel 7)</strong><br>With Flintoff struggling, Panesar makes his first appearance of the day and produces the goods with his third ball. De Villiers gets caught on the crease and rapped on the back pad. To the naked eye it looks a great shout, and the umpire wastes little time in raising the finger, but Hawkeye suggests it was heading an inch or two over. Still, it's been England's session. Join Rob Smyth after tea, for thrilling news of Ntini and Nel's century partnership.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>Hello boys!</strong> A performance rich in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'esprit_de_l'escalier\">l'esprit d'escalier</a> from England has been rather enjoyable despite its contextual insignificance. In the afternoon session they showed the value of a) pitching the ball up, b) a four-man pace attack, and c) a series of batsmen whose minds are still in the dressing-room at Edgbaston, taking six wickets for 45 after South Africa, aided by 477 dropped catches from Alastair Cook, had reached 103 for one.</p> <p>There were two wickets for Steve Harmison, somewhere close to his best, one for Monty Panesar with the final ball of the afternoon session, his third of the match, and three for Jimmy Anderson, who muddied the selection waters ahead of the winter tour* with some very good swing bowling.</p> <p>There were shades of the <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/225258.html\">Oval Test of two years ago</a>, when the side with an unassailable 2-0 lead batted skittishly and were rolled for 173, with nobody reaching fifty and the second and third wickets falling to consecutive deliveries. We can, however, safely assume this game won't end in the same way as that one.</p> <p>Kevin Pietersen has captained by numbers, but that is not entirely without virtue and its better than captaining like a complete digit. Judgement on him cannot come in this game. The downsides have been another statistically ordinary performance from Stuart Broad (9-2-46-0), which pushed his Test average above 50, and an utterly farcical over rate of 12.5 per hour, as a consequence of which we will have 40.3 overs in this session, light and will to live permitting.</p> <p>*<em>One of Broad, Anderson, Flintoff, Harmison, Sidebottom and Jones will surely miss out. And since you asked so nicely, my party would be: Denly/Vaughan (depending on the latter's state of mind and whether he's had that silly hair cut), Cook, Bell, Pietersen, Collingwood, Bopara, Flintoff, Prior, Foster, Broad, Jones, Harmison, Panesar, Swann, Sidebottom</em>.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Riffwatch</strong> You can suggest anything, anything, so long as it doesn't involve ironic veneration of something from the 80s.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 158-7 (Morkel 7, Harris 0)</strong> Monty, rough-track bully that he is becoming, will fancy a few cheap tail-end wickets here, but I doubt we'll be seeing him again in this innins.

And Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>51st over: South Africa 163-7 (Morkel 12, Harris 0)</strong> Broad stays on, which one suspects is an attempt to give him some cheap, happiness-facilitating wickets. He almost gets one first ball, but the windiest of woofs from Morkel screws over the slips for four.</p> <p>\"Riff,\" says Alexander Netherton. \"Cultural works pre-1950s that still have meaning to our lives.\" Yep well that worked well; what's next? It is a fact that anything in black and white, be it football, films or even judgements, is <em>rubbish</em>.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>52nd over: South Africa 164-7 (Morkel 13, Harris 0)</strong> Panesar does continue, which I can't really explain. Nothing happens. <br>\"I spent three hours in the pub last night locked in stalemate trying to push the case for Matt Prior against a similarly vociferous Chris Read fan,\" says Sam Blackledge, who sounds like the sort of guy I'd like to go drinking with. \"One thing we are agreed on, Ambrose's days are numbered...\" Well yes. To me, it's simple, you go with one extreme (best batsman) or the other (best keeper). If you play five bowlers \u2013 which I would \u2013 it's Prior, batting at No6 or No7 depending on Flintoff's batting self-esteem; if you play four it's Read, batting at No8. This only becomes a problem when you fully embrace squad rotation, which won't happen in this country until approximately five years after Australia do the same.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 168-8 (Morkel c Bell b Broad 17)</strong> Morkel top-edges a pull off Broad for four. If his figures were subject to classification, he wouldn't look old enough to be allowed to see see them: this is, statistically at least, X-rated stuff. But they look a bit better now: Morkel gets in a fearful tangle against a well-directed short one, and can only pop it straight up in the air. Ian Bell, charging in from short leg. takes an excellent catch diving forward.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>53rd over: South Africa 168-8 (Harris 0, Nel 0)</strong> In hilarious scenes not matched since the advent of political correctness cut down Jim Davidson in his pomp, Morkel walked off the wrong end of the pitch, towards the groundman's shed. I haven't seen so many genuine smiles around here since last month's cheque arrived from the folks.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 168-8 (Harris 0, Nel 0)</strong> Harmison replaces Panesar and beats Harris with a nice leg-cutter. The rest of the over contained a little bit too much machismo. </p> <p>\"'Anything in black and white is rubbish'. Does that include 'Following'?\" asks Jeremy Theobald, simultaneously shattering my argument and blowing his own trumpet.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 172-9 (Nel c Ambrose b Broad 4)</strong> Nel heaves a roundhouse pull off Broad for four; an aesthetic violation, but an effective one. That's the end of the fun, though: later in the over Nel thin-edges a full delivery through to Ambrose, who is so busy trying to work out what day it is that he doesn't bother to celebrate. I think he thought Nel's bat had hit the ground. Either way, these are important wickets for Broad.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>55th over: South Africa 172-9 (Harris 0, Ntini 0)</strong> \"Anderson as our most consistently threatening bowler and wicket taker has to go - simple as that,\" says Jim Morgan. Look, Anderson will never be world-class. Broad might, so we must invest with him because, whether you like it or not, this is a transitional period. Nine times out of ten, Anderson is meat and drink to good batsmen.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>56th over: South Africa 173-9 (Harris 1, Ntini 0)</strong> Harmison is keenly sniffing a cheap wicket, rather like Nathan Barley's Jonattan Yeah? sniffed an opportunity. But despite Harris looking utterly hideous, he doesn't get it.</p> <p>\"Isn't your judgement of black and white things itself a little on the black and white side of things?\" says Nicholas Crabtree. Supersize that whoop-whoop: somebody finally got the joke.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>57th over: South Africa 173-9 (Harris 1, Ntini 0)</strong> Broad is enjoying himself now, toying with Harris's outside edge. He beats him at least three times in that over, probably more, but Harris somehow survives to continue one of the filthiest innings it has ever been my displeasure to do typing about.</p> <p>\"Sidebottom is the one to go for me,\" says Will Horwood. \"He's too slow, and yes he's taken a lot of wickets, but we played New Zealand twice and the West Indies - far and away the two worst major nations. Australia would take him to the cleaners.\" Not if it's swinging they wouldn't. I am inclined to agree up to a point, but I think he's done enough to deserve another chance to prove he can deliver cheapish wickets against proper teams.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>58th over: South Africa 175-9 (Harris 1, Ntini 2)</strong> This is an utter farce now; Harmison goes past Ntini's edge three more times in that over. In other news, I can't believe how highly you all rate Anderson. Against proper opposition (ie the top six) he has 57 wickets at an average of 42. Next!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>59th over: South Africa 176-9 (Harris 2, Ntini 2)</strong> Broad beats Ntini again. In fairness that was a jaffa - a shortish leg-cutter - that would have beaten most players.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>60th over: South Africa 182-9 (Harris 8, Ntini 2)</strong> Harmison, bored of beating the outside edge, has a Eureka! moment and decides to bowl at the stumps. So Harris humps him into the leg side for four. Harmison responds with an unpleasant bouncer that puts Harris on the seat of his grundies.</p> <p>\"Is this Prior you're advocating (52nd over) the same Prior who was so vilified last summer for his clunky mistakes and hideously inconsistent batting?\" says Dennis O'Neill. \"My, but you lot are fickle.\" I'm rather perturbed at the idea of carrying the can of an entire nation, although like everyone else Prior did engage my wick last summer. But, as is so often the case, you come to realise that the grass isn't necessarily greener elsewhere. The poverty of our wicketkeeping resources means that a compromise is going to be made whoever we pick; I prefer this particular compromise, with Prior given time to improve his keeping (which can be done, as Alec Stewart showed) and in the team as long as he averages the right side of 32.45.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>61st over: South Africa 184-9 (Harris 9, Ntini 3)</strong> Anderson is on for Broad, the right move in this particular situation, and he immediately starts curving the ball past some grotesque Leatherface-style swinging from Ntini. This shouldn't take long.</p> <p>\"Was it a different Rob Smyth describing Anderson as 'a must' prior to the 2006 Ashes?\" says Alan White. \"He can't have got worse since then, can he?\" He hasn't, but Jones is fit and Sidebottom and Broad now exist. They weren't born in 2006.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 186-9 (Harris 11, Ntini 3)</strong> Flintoff replaces Harmison in an attempt to end a partnership that is a cleave to third man away from becoming officially irritating. No dice, though: Harris edges to third man for two.</p> <p>\"Having played half of his matches against NZ, Broad's average is pushing 50,\" says Tom Paternoster. \"Next!\" Too small a sample size. Next!</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>63rd over: South Africa 190-9 (Harris 11, Ntini 7)</strong> A preposterous shot from Ntini, who flat-bats Anderson back down the ground for four - a bit like the shot Pietersen played off Lee on the final day of the Ashes, only minus the flair, talent and it being our brave boys.</p> <p>\"Panesar is like a puppy,\" says Ian Palmer. \"Fun for a little while, but when he persistently doesn't do as you tell him, it just gets annoying.\" Especially for those two blokes next door in white coats whose swingers he keeps sinking his molars into.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>64th over: South Africa 192-9 (Harris 13, Ntini 7)</strong> See over 57. And 58. And 59. In fact, all of them since over 57. The weird thing about is this partnership is that you're absolutely certain it will end any minute now. Just as England were in the first Test in New Zealand in 1996-97, when Danny Morrison just batted on and on and on and on and on and on for four hours. That day might just be the most remarkable/absurd in Test history. <em>Four hours</em>.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>Drinks break chit-chat from Matt Delargy</strong> \"Isn't the point this - we can have more than four pace bowlers at any one time, take them around with us, and pick them to suit the conditions? Kind of like a squad system. So you get to change the bowlers without the hysterical reaction to each perceived dropping of a player forever more. Four from seven picked each time.\" What he said. Yes. Yes. <em>Yes</em>.</p> <p>I wrote <a href=\"http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/blog/?p=78\">a piece</a>on the Wisden Cricketer site advocating squad rotation a couple of weeks back, but it needs people to be enlightened, and such people don't really exist in English cricket, do they.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 194 all out (Ntini b Panesar 9)</strong> KP brings on Panesar, invites him to flight the ball - and gets the desired result fifth ball, when Ntini fresh-airs a huge swat and is bowled. Good captaincy and good bowling. England will be back in 10 minutes to begin their innings of 374. See you then.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>Innings-break natter</strong> Strauss, whose strike rate in this series is 34.01, a sub-Tavare figure if you factor in 21st-century weighting, could do with both a score (no fifties in this series) but also a positive innings, because I really don't think there is room for two stonewallers at the top of the order. Cook, to his credit, is incrementally expanding his game, but he would still be much better with a dasher \u2013 Vaughan, Denly, or that fella from Somerset \u2013 alongside him.</p> <p>\"Foster Foster,\" says John Robinson. I'd definitely have a look in the one-day games if we are batting the keeper in the lower-middle order (if it's an opener it should be the harshly treated Mustard). I'm just not sure he could bat No7 in the Test team.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Rafa Benitez, cricket visionary</strong> \"Mr Delargy advocates rotating the pacemen,\" says Gary Naylor. \"'Four from seven picked each time'. Seven huh? So that's the one with the bad knee, the one with the bad back, the one who's homesick, the one who's a bit undercooked, the one who's lost his nip, the one with the bad ankle and the one who's really more of a batsman? Actually, I agree, but you'd never rotate a McGrath or a Marshall or a Hadlee. First find two bowlers who can take wickets at 25 (never mind 23), then build the attack round them.\" While I agree, pretty much, you would rotate them against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe wouldn't you?</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 1-0 (Strauss 1, Cook 0)</strong> Morkel doesn't bother with the formalities and goes straight around the wicket to Strauss, who has been troubled by that line of attack. Morkel, quietly, has been the top wicket-taker in this series (Anderson is second, to his credit), but he's off line here, with the first two deliveries, and the fourth, skipping down the leg side. The last ball is on the money though, and beats Cook.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 5-0 (Strauss 5, Cook 0)</strong> The pie-chucker formerly known as Makhaya Ntini begins at the other end. His average for the series is 53.14, and it doesn't get any better in that over, as Strauss ignores a series of deliveries slanted across him from over the wicket and then works a straighter one classily through midwicket for four. It'll be really interesting to see whether South Africa go with Nel or Ntini for the Australia Tests, all other things being equal. I'd go Nel, definitely.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 7-0 (Strauss 6, Cook 1)</strong> Morkel beats Strauss with a really good delivery that pitches a fraction short of a length and leg-cuts just enough to skip past the edge. Beautifully bowled. But Morkel keeps falling over in his follow through, so he might have to switch back to over the wicket. In the meantime, a man with a shovel has come on - and then gone off without doing anything.</p> <p>\"How do you think this series will be remembered?\" asks Andrew Moore. \"It hasn't really ignited apart from at Edgbaston on Day 4, and South Africa have won without it seems having to play particularly well. It will probably be remembered for the end of Vaughan, but should also be remembered for some of the most confused selections (and I'm not just talking Pattinson) since Fletcher couldn't decide between Giles or Panesar and Read or Jones.\" That's it, pretty much. It will be remembered for Vaughan and for Pattinson. Only if South Africa go on to beat Australia this winter will it be remembered as a really significant stepping stone for them. I'll remember it for Smith's innings, I think.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 7-1 (Strauss c Smith b Ntini 6)</strong> Watching England's openers is one of life's more unrewarding experiences: the middle overs of the ODI without the promise of fireworks at the end; listening to what someone else has to say without the promise of your turn to speak next; buying him/her a drink without the promise of- AWP he's gone again. Textbook stuff: from over the wicket Ntini slanted it across Strauss, who felt for a ball he didn't need to play it and just snicked it through to Smith at first slip.</p> <p>Across the desk Sam Collins holds up a piece of paper that reads \"Strauss RIP\". It should be, as well. He is unrecognisable from the player we saw a few years ago, and if you don't believe me watch the 04-05 DVD. He was sen<em>sa</em>tional.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 7-1 (Cook 1, Bell 0)</strong> Ian Bell survives the rest of the over. I hope Bell gets a decent run - the next seven Tests, say - in his preferred No3 position. And if he continues to completely bottle the pressure points, then we can justify his existence no longer.</p> <p>His <em>place</em>. I meant his place.</p> <p>\"Answers those who called for Strauss to captain,\" tut-tuts Clare Davies. \"He was found out a while ago, and has become a bunny.\" What she said.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 10-1 (Cook 4, Bell 0)</strong> Bell snicks Morkel well short of third slip, and is then squared up and beaten by a handy lifter. \"43.67\" says Alastair Halton, brings back happy memories of an insecure and almost painfully decent man with a cute moustache unveiling the greatest square-cut in the history of anything ever.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 11-1 (Cook 5, Bell 0)</strong> Ntini continues with his over-the-wicket line to Cook, but he knows his off stump a lot better than Strauss at the moment. Cook has its digits in his phone and exchanges texts at least once a week; Strauss isn't even friends with his on Facebook. Just one run to Cook in that over.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 15-1 (Cook 9, Bell 0)</strong> Cook works Morkel off his pads for four, but then he is beaten by a majestic leg-cutter. Cook's strike rate for Tests this year, by the way, is 46.35 - which puts him behind only (in order) Broad, Pietersen and Bell. He is starting to develop his game, however slowly.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 20-1 (Cook 9, Bell 5)</strong> Bell takes an uncomfortably tight single to Amla at midwicket, and is home by <em>this</em> much. The ball flew away to the boundary off the stumps, so he gets five for it.</p> <p>\"Way back when you were predicting Bell to make 8,000 runs at 45 over his career,\" says Tim Young. \"He's currently just shy of 3,000 at 43 ish - just interested (genuinely!) whether you'd stand by the initial prediction, as he's kind of pretty much on target. . .Or was it Lawrence Booth making that bet?\" I think it was both of us. In tandem. While wearing the same Y-fronts. But I do stand by it, sort of: I think it will be 8000 at 42. He'll always be too talented \u2013 and make too many cheap runs \u2013 to be dropped, but won't do enough against the good team to average 45.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 21-1 (Cook 9, Bell 6)</strong> \"On Broad, I think a simple change of definition would help his fledgling career,\" says John Ogmore. \"Just call him the all-rounder. There'd then be less public and media pressure on his bowling and he wouldn't be constantly perceived as the weak link, with Flintoff reclassified as the fourth bowler. Suddenly England have a much stronger four man attack on paper and a useful fifth bowler in Broad.\" It's an interesting argument. I'm not sure: you could go the other way and say that, to classify him as such, would exacerbate the doubts he is starting to develop over his bowling. And in turn the implied pressure to achieve with the bat might make him play differently. But then it might make him even better. I don't know. Nobody knows anything really.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 29-1 (Cook 9, Bell 14)</strong> Successive boundaries to Bell off Ntini: the first is timed off his hip and the second punched through the covers off the back foot. Classy stuff. \"Hit the stumps and give away overthrows - that's not on is it?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Imagine Stanford's $10M or whatever turning on that!\"</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 32-1 (Cook 11, Bell 15)</strong> Bell is playing nicely, but even if he scores 401 it will tell us nothing we don't know. That's the other problem for Bell: he has been typecast to such an extent that he will have to do almost twice as much to change perceptions of him.</p> <p>\"Just for fun, and on an experimental one-Test basis, why not reclassify all the batsmen as bowlers?\" says Adam Blackwell. \"See if it takes the pressure off and increases their runs, or simply compounds the humiliation and reduces them to tears.\" I like it. Make them wear each other's shoes and pants as well.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 36-1 (Cook 14, Bell 16)</strong> Ntini has a big shout for LBW against Cook turned down on the not unreasonable grounds that Cook middled it onto his pads. </p> <p>\"This talk of Ian Bell being a wimp is always something I find really harsh,\" says Dan Connolly. \"He may be extremely talented but do OBO readers not appreciated that it has taken a lot of guts for him to make it this far bearing mind the pressure he was under from a very young age to be the best player in the country. I remember growing up playing cricket the talk was that Ian Bell was going to be the next big thing. That kind of pressure destroys many young kids who often don't even make it into the professional game...I don't think he is quite the yellow-bellied dilettante he is painted as...\"</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 38-1 (Cook 14, Bell 17)</strong> Andre Nel, the new bowler, is wearing one Puma and one Asics trainer. But it's plain sailing for England, as it should be on this pitch, and Bell enjoys a risk-free sighter against the new bowler. If the sun's out tomorrow, England should make 400 at the very least.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 42-1 (Cook 18, Bell 17)</strong> Cook angles Ntini to third man for four. \"Thanks for the kind words for Dylan this morning,\" say Andy and Dylan Bradshaw. \"And also give a big thanks to all the staff who helped at Queens Hospital, Burton?\" What he said.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 46-1 (Cook 18, Bell 21)</strong> Elegant stuff from Bell, who just eases Nel through midwicket for four. \"Here's the South African bowlers dossier I found round the back of the pavilion,\" says Dan Curtis. <br>\"Cook - allow him to get to 60 in 200 balls, he'll not score for another 30 or 40, then he'll get himself out. <br>Strauss - bowl three balls in a row outside off stump.<br>Vaughan - pitch it up and swing it away. Observe amusing bemused face as he walks off.<br>Pietersen - allow him to within 6 of any landmark and drop the field out.<br>Colly - underarm will do.<br>Bell - Bouch to whisper in his ear that the pressure is on.<br>Ambrose - see Colly.\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 48-1 (Cook 20, Bell 21)</strong> Play has to finish at 6.30pm, apparently, so we won't get our full quota today. England are so snug that it would be an absolute crime for them to lose a wicket now. Cook tucks Ntini away off his pads for two. This pitch is a belter.</p> <p>\"Dan Connolly is right about Bell,\" says Mac Millings. \"I know you like Duncan Fletcher, but he was a bit out of order the other week on his blog when he criticised Bell for getting out on 199 - I mean he'd made 199, for goodness sake!\" True, but there was something so <em>Bellish</em> about that dismissal. In many ways, he is Gower-lite, except Gower made big runs at squeaky-bum time. We can't put an exact value on runs, but by any qualitative judgement I think it's reasonable to say that Bell has made just a few too many cheap runs for comfort. He's a seriously talented boy, mind, and in his defence we shouldn't forget that he got four fifties batting at No3 in the 2006-07 Ashes, which wasn't a bad return.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 49-1 (trail by 145; Cook 20, Bell 22)</strong> So that's that. As KP lay in bed last night asking Jessica for permission to breathe, and dreaming about his first day as captain, it wouldn't have been much better than this: South Africa rolled for 194, and England proceeding comfortably on a pitch that looks like it will hand out runs like those blokes at the tube station do London Lites. I'm off to pick up the aforementioned free rag on my way home. Thanks for all your emails today; apologies for not being able to use them all. See you on the flip side.</p>",

If you are using a portable device, it will probably have a mini-jack at both ends. For preference, plug it into a line-out on the Walkman, rather than the headphone socket.

You can still make compressed MP3 or AAC versions for everyday use.</p> <p>The process is basically the same if you buy a specialised recorder such as ION Audio's Tape2PC deck, except it connects to the PC via a USB port. (Also, Tape2PC uses Apple's iTunes, which gives slightly inferior quality to Audacity/LAME, though this may not matter with most audio cassette recordings.)</p> <p>An even simpler and cheaper approach is not to use a PC at all.</p> <p>In this case, all you need is an MP3 player that has a <em>direct encoding (line-in)</em> feature, plus a stereo line-in cable (sometimes called a Direct Encoding Cable) costing about a fiver or less. Players with the line-in feature include the Creative Zen V+, iAudio X5, MPIO HD200, iRiver X20 and <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22mp3+player%22+direct+encoding+%28line-in%29&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB\">many more</a> (or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0002\">http://bit.ly/aj0002</a>).</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Check the specs! For example, the <a href=\"http://uk.europe.creative.com/products/product.asp?category=213&amp;subcategory=214&amp;product=15306&amp;nav=0&amp;listby=\">Zen V+</a> offers \"Line-in Recording: WMA (128 kbps and 160 kbps)\" and you may not want to record to WMA. I wouldn't....</p> <p><strong>Backchat</strong>: John Blackburn suggests the shareware <a href=\"http://www.milosoftware.com/cdwave/index.html\">CD Wave</a> instead: \"This software is simpler than Audacity and has the very useful (and, indeed, important) feature of being able to split the music into tracks, either automatically or with manual assistance. CD Wave will save the resulting tracks as WAV, MP3, OGG or FLAC files. WAV is for making audio CDs and MP3 is for the car. FLAC files are lossless, as you say, and are about half the size of WAV files.\"</p> <p>Tim Gossling points out that it does have track splitting: go to Analyze and select Silence finder to automate the process \"with probably varying degrees of success, particularly for classical music,\" he says. \"Manual splitting is done via Project and Add label at selection: click in the label field and type in a title. File|Export multiple will then generate multiple files, each named with the track label.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>Have you tried the Microsoft spellchecker in Outlook Express, on the word \"Obama\"?
