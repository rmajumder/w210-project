  "<p>Even if one knew nothing about Marc Andre's background, it would take just a few bars of any one of the chamber pieces in this collection to work out where his affinities lie. The fractured textures in durch, for saxophone, percussion and piano - a mosaic of breathy exhalations and prepared piano sounds coloured by the sympathetic resonances from gongs - and the etiolated glissandi that make up much of the string trio ...zu..., both immediately suggest connections with the sound world of Helmut Lachenmann. In fact the 44-year-old, Paris-born Andre was a pupil of the German pedagogue after initially studying in France with Gerard Grisey, and out of those two formidable creative voices he has established his own synthesis, to which he has given a personal slant by giving Christian associations to his works, so that both ...zu... and ...als...II, for bass clarinet, cello, piano and live electronics, refer to passages in the Book of Revelation, while durch stems from part of St Luke's gospel.

  "<p>The life of my father, Geoffrey Holmes, who has died aged 90, was changed by two small newspaper advertisements, the first in the Daily Telegraph, the second in the New Statesman.</p> <p>The first led him to join the metals manufacturing firm London and Scandinavian Metallurgical (LSM) in 1939, a company founded by German Jewish refugees. There he was plunged into an extraordinary world of anti-fascist \u00e9migr\u00e9s, including communists, revolutionaries, pacifists, chemists, artists and musicians in wartime London. His whole working life was spent with LSM, where, through experience and professional diplomas gained at night school, he became chief chemist and an expert in the analysis of the rare metals. </p> <p>The second advert proposed \"English lessons in exchange for German\". This led Geoffrey to Rosl Windler, a Jewish refugee, whom he would later marry. Through Rosl he also met Trude Falk, whom he married after Rosl's death in 1974. He counted himself among the lucky few to have experienced two silver wedding anniversaries. </p> <p>Born in Essex, my father was never able to go to university, because his father died when he was 12. In the late 1930s, he was a member of the pacifist Peace Pledge Union. But meeting Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria changed his view of the war, and he volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm. However, because of the importance of the metals industry, his job was declared a reserved occupation.</p> <p>Later, he lived for 54 years in the house he designed and built in Sheffield, where he participated in a range of cultural and scientific organisations. After he and Trude moved to Lewes, Sussex, in 2005, they took part in the social and intellectual activities that went on there.</p> <p>Geoffrey was a principled man. He was proud to have campaigned in the 1945 general election, and was a supporter of the traditional Labour party. A firm atheist, he believed in the principles of the scientific method. He was also deeply interested in the world around him. His reading included AE Housman, Primo Levi, Trollope, Raymond Chandler and Richard Dawkins - as well as the Guardian. </p> <p>I found myself admiring my father more and more each day as he approached the end. He prepared himself and others with the calm rationality and thoughtfulness that defined him. He is survived by Trude, myself and daughter-in-law Ann, and grandchildren Alex and Tammy.</p>",
  "<p>Mainly, right now, it's just a forest of figures: 12% wiped off property prices in a year; new mortgage approvals down by 71%; house sales at a 30-year-low; bank lending to homebuyers down by \u00a312.1bn; one in seven homeowners in negative equity within two years; repossession orders up 24%; 45,000 families set to lose their homes.</p> <p>We are transfixed by these numbers. They are writ large on our front pages and lead the news bulletins. Property is our great, our overriding national obsession. To an extent that is unique almost in the world - and certainly in Europe - we follow every twitch of the market with fixated fascination. When it's in trouble, it's like the very soul of the nation is at stake. </p> <p>But there is another story behind the impenetrable array of numbers that our so-called property crisis generates every day (and to which the government was proud to add this week: \u00a3600m emergency rescue package; 1% stamp duty threshold hiked to \u00a3175,000; 340,000 buyers aided; 16,000 reposessions prevented).</p> <p>It's a story about how on earth we came to be in this state. How did we get to a point where grotesque nouveau kitsch mansions in The Bishops Avenue, aka Billionaire's Row in Hampstead, north London, can sell for \u00a340m, small converted mews houses - homes, in other words, for horses - fetch \u00a36m, and 1.6 million people are currently stuck on council waiting lists? </p> <p>How can it be that Notting Hill, a part of London that 50 years ago was a sewage-sodden, low-rent slum, can now contain a top-floor flat bought 40 years ago for \u00a312,000 and now on the market for \u00a3800,000? \"It really wasn't an investment,\" protests its owner, Joy, a recently retired primary-school teacher who understandably does not want her surname widely known. \"I was just buying a place to live. In a pretty daggy part of London, too.\" </p> <p>How, also, has a motormouth Mancunian former joke writer called Mike Shirley been able to parlay his \u00a36,000 purchase of a two-up, two-down terraced house in 1997 into a buy-to-let portfolio worth \u00a37m? And what, at the other end of the scale, has happened in this country that first-time buyers, to obtain a competitively priced mortgage, need a deposit equivalent to two years' take-home, while locals in Cornish fishing villages must confront an average house price of roughly 11 times their earnings?</p> <p>The change has been so massive, so far-reaching, and so rapid that it is easy to forget what things were once like. Less than a century ago, only 10% of Britons owned their own homes. Even 30 years ago, half of us were still renting. Now more than 70% of us are homeowners. And most of that 70% have become an awful lot richer, at least on paper: in October 2007, the average house price in Britain was \u00a3218,000, more than three times the 1995 level, four times the 1988 level, and roughly 50 times the 1970 level. </p> <p>If house prices fall even 20%, most of us will still be very much quids in.</p> <p>According to the housing charity Shelter, in just three decades, from 1971 to 2002, combined housing wealth in Britain spiralled from \u00a344bn to a barely imaginable \u00a32.5tn - that's double the level of pension and life-assurance savings put together. So much money have we made from this unprecedented boom that we've started buying homes not just for ourselves, but for others, too: hundreds of thousands of us are now landlords, holding a total of 1.1m buy-to-let mortgages and ploughing \u00a3126bn into investment property since 1997.</p> <p>So what has driven our insane, headlong pursuit of property ownership? Objective external factors - an influx of foreign money, huge City bonuses - have played a role, particularly in parts of London. Low interest rates have been critical. But there's something even more fundamental than that: simply, we no longer see our homes just as places to live. In the past 30 years, our attitude to them has changed, completely. In fact, we no longer even think \"home\", we think \"property\". We think investment. Capital gain. Sure-fire winner. Gotta do it; get in there; be crazy not to. Right-to-buy, loan-to-value, buy-to-let, remortgage, equity release, rental yield, profit. Lots of it. (Or, just at the moment, not.)</p> <p>With a little help from successive governments only too happy for us all to feel rich, contented and readily inclined to vote for them, and an array of profit-hungry financial institutions embarked on a wildly irresponsible feeding frenzy, we have succeeded in commoditising what should be a fundamental human right: to have a roof over our heads. And once that happens, logically, every profit-seeker and speculator out there moves in, and - equally importantly - all of us who have bought suddenly have a deeply entrenched interest in ensuring that those prices continue to spiral upwards. </p> <p>\"Essentially, what has happened in this country is that we've confused home ownership with the acquisition of wealth,\" says Adam Sampson, Shelter's chief executive. \"Those two concepts, which should be distinct, have become irrevocably yoked together. It shows plainly in the reasons people give for wanting to buy: 30 or 40 years ago, you bought a home for security, stability, status, to gain control over your life. Now you do it to acquire wealth. And that has been encouraged as an article of faith across the political spectrum. It really has been the equivalent of the South Sea Bubble, or the Dutch tulip bulb hysteria.\"</p> <p>Our fixation with ownership has changed the way the country looks, in some places quite radically: go to the centres of cities such as Manchester or Leeds today and the skyline is filled with tower after tower of identical two-bedroom \"luxury\" buy-to-let apartments, 40% of them empty. </p> <p>Built by developers eager to profit from the vast piles of equity Britain's homeowners had accumulated, they have been bought largely by amateur investors who, in many cases, didn't bother to visit the site or even the city beforehand, so convinced were they that they were guaranteed a killing. These were homes for money, not people.</p> <p>In London, the populations and appearance of districts such as Notting Hill have altered beyond all recognition. Home even 30 years ago largely to art students, Irish labourers and new West Indian immigrants, they are now the natural habitat of the hedge-fund trader happy to pay \u00a34m for a house, then another million to rip out and replace last year's comprehensive remodelling. Across the country, 2.3m houses that were publicly owned in 1980 are now private homes (and have not been replaced). In the south-west, equity-rich second-home owners have left some villages half shut-up for 80% of the year; some 241,000 Britons now own second homes in England, and more than 250,000 of us have bought a holiday place abroad. </p> <p>But perhaps even more fundamentally, our ever-ballooning property bubble has changed us. Most of our grandparents' generation did not even dream of owning their homes. For many of our parents, a secure council-house tenancy was the limit of their property ambition. In Harlow new town, Essex, Les and Irene Coben have lived in the same former council house for 51 years. They moved there from two rooms in Whitechapel, East London, and were, Rene recalls, overjoyed at the prospect of an indoor toilet. \"This was a dream house to me,\" says Rene. \"What more could I want?\" (Although even Les, morally opposed to home ownership and loth to saddle himself with a big debt, bowed to the inevitable in the early 1990s and used his retirement money to exercise his right to buy.)</p> <p>Now the vast majority of us feel we have an inalienable right not only to own our home, but to make money out of it. Renting, on the other hand, unless you're doing it short-term with a view to saving up for a deposit or are in between moves, is strictly for losers.</p> <p>Our obsession with ownership has had enormous social consequences. Shelter argues, with good reason, that in today's Britain whether or not a family owns its own home shapes children's lives, affecting their educational opportunities, employment options, life choices and with that, the entire nation's social mobility. </p> <p>(Except it's not quite enough to be born into a home-owning family. Better be born into a family that owns a home in a well-off area, where house values have increased far more than those in less fortunate neighbourhoods. And that's a very recent phenomenon: for the price of an average house in Kensington, the country's wealthiest housing area, 10 years ago, you could have bought two houses in Leven, Fife, the country's poorest. Today, you could buy 24.) </p> <p>Being born into a home-owning family in early 21st-century Britain is not so very different from being born into the aristocracy of old. Meanwhile, in addition to the 149,900 families officially recognised as newly homeless in England, Scotland and Wales in 2007, up to 400,000 mainly single people are classified as the \"hidden homeless\" - those who satisfy the legal definition of homelessness, but have not been provided with long-term accommodation. </p> <p>Our homes now are our pensions, our guarantees of future wealth and happiness, our ever-generous flexible friends. \"Take a bit of equity out\" or \"Stick it on the mortgage\" have become the keys to unlocking a seemingly limitless source of cash: why not use all that dosh locked up in bricks and mortar to pay for a nice new kitchen or loft extension, offer a private education to our children, pay for better holidays or a new car, to help - in time - our offspring onto the property ladder themselves? </p> <p>That is why banks and building societies offered 110% mortgages to borrowers without even demanding proper proof of earnings. That's why some of us borrowed up to seven times our salaries. That's why developers persuaded the nation it needed tens of thousands of luxury two-bed city-centre apartments, and estate agents convinced us tiny flats in dodgy parts of London could be worth \u00a3300,000 (and they were worth that, actually, because that's what some people were happy to pay for them). And that's why we've seen the huge popularity of a whole raft of spin-off products: the property TV show (even I've just made one), the home-improvement mag. We have become, in a way very few other nations have, a people who define ourselves by the places we live in. </p> <p>I have, I confess, a personal interest in all this, because I cannot afford to buy a house for my family in London. Back in 1985, I bought the first and only home I've ever owned here: a small one-bed flat on a busy bus route in Acton. It cost \u00a332,000, which was well under twice what my then wife and I earned in a year (and we had to endure a half-hour grilling with the bank manager to get the loan.)</p> <p>A couple of years later I moved abroad, and in 1989 the flat was sold, for about \u00a370,000. We won't do better than that, I thought. And I stayed abroad, in a range of European cities where most people are just as happy to rent as they are to buy, for nearly 20 years. Last year I came back, and discovered that the same first-time buyer's, one-bed flat was worth, near as dammit, a quarter of a million pounds.</p> <p>That meant, I calculated, that many young couples would probably need to borrow six or seven times their joint income to buy it. Which, it seems to me, is an insane state of affairs. (In fact, even earning what I consider a pretty fair salary, in my late 40s, and taking into account a 10% fall in property prices, I still could barely afford that flat - let alone the three-bed place I now need.)</p> <p>So is there a way out of it? The market itself may do some of the work. Badly burned banks, one hopes, may have learned their lessons about responsible lending; once the present turbulence is over, mortgages will perhaps return to the traditional maximum of two and a half or three times properly verified earnings. That would calm things down. And even if house prices do end up falling 20% or 30%, no one is predicting that will be followed by a repeat of the vertiginous, unsustainable inflation of the past couple of decades. If we all get used to small, steady price increases of maybe 4% or 5%, perhaps we'll stop dreaming our property dreams. Long term, certainly, house prices cannot continue to outstrip the ability of people to pay for them (although there will always be an international market, in London, for excess). </p> <p>But it may take a generation or two before we erase a culture that hammers home, wherever you look, the enticing message that home ownership is the best route to personal wealth. Shelter's Sampson suggests a number of strategies that could, perhaps, speed up the process: first up, a thorough review of the link between housing and taxation. </p> <p>\"There's nothing intrinsically wrong with home ownership,\" he says, \"particularly if the alternative is expensive private renting with a maximum of six months' security of tenure, or increasingly residual social housing. Home ownership encourages stability and social stakeholding. But in recent years my house has earned far more than I have. I work and am taxed; it doesn't and is not. Is that justifiable?\" (It may not be, but there are problems with this option. If you tax the profit made on selling a primary residence, what do you do about a loss?)</p> <p>Less controversially, perhaps, it would help if private renting was a genuine alternative to ownership, as it is in much of mainland Europe, where most tenants benefit from long-term security and relatively low rents. \"We also need to rethink our relationship to the homes we live in,\" says Sampson, who believes the kind of sale-and-leaseback scheme proposed by the government this week to help homeowners threatened with repossession could and should be more common. Just as buyers take years to acquire a house by repaying a mortgage, owners should be able to step out gradually, too. \"We need to reach a point where just because you're no longer the owner, it doesn't mean you have to abandon your house. What you have is a home: you may rent it, you may buy it.\" Or it may be a bit of both.</p> <p>Building enough new houses - which we have not been doing since the 1970s - might help restore us to sanity, too. But the impact would, experts reckon, be marginal: Ireland has practically doubled its house numbers over the past decade, and watched its property prices also double. Gordon Brown has promised to build 3m new homes in Britain between now and 2020, including a deeply controversial clutch of so-called ecotowns but, even assuming the construction business recovers from its current catastrophic slowdown, this is going to be an almost impossible target to meet. </p> <p>Planning constraints, and the often concerted opposition of local homeowners convinced that any major new developments in their back yards will inevitably knock thousands more off the value of their houses, make major new building projects in this country a fraught affair. In the idyllic countryside around Stratford-upon-Avon, for example, the cunningly named Bard campaign (for Better Accessible Responsible Development) is fighting a fierce rearguard action against a 6,000-home ecotown planned for a former MoD site at nearby Long Marston. </p> <p>Some 15,000 people have so far signed Bard's petition against the development, which, it says, meets no discernible local housing or employment needs and will result in thousands of new car commuters - there being little or no public transport - swamping historic Stratford with traffic on their way to the big urban conurbations to the north.</p> <p>Ecotowns have run into some trouble since the prime minister first floated the plan this time last year. Six of the 16 projects, each containing between 5,000 and 20,000 supposedly eco-friendly new homes, 30% them affordable housing, have already fallen by the wayside, and a seventh has been radically scaled back. In the face of mounting local opposition and the very real prospect of court action, the housing minister, Caroline Flint, recently let it be known - albeit discreetly - that the final list of approved projects, now likely to total considerably fewer than the original target of 10, will not be announced until next spring, several months later than scheduled.</p> <p>Bard has some big-name backers, including Dame Judi Dench, John Nettles, Julian Lloyd Webber, publisher Felix Dennis and - rather ironically, given the group's traffic concerns - ex-formula one driver Johnny Herbert. But no matter how valid the arguments, it's hard to believe that Bard's opposition is not also reinforced by nimbyism. Protesters here do fear for their house prices, and several sales have fallen through since the ecotown plan was announced. \"Fundamentally, it's about preserving our existing environment,\" confesses Clive Moy, a retired chartered surveyor. \"Most of us chose to live here, in this wonderful countryside, and the last thing we want is a new town in the middle of it.\" </p> <p>Sampson is not entirely downcast. \"It could be, it just could be, that looked at through the long lens of history, Britain's mad rush towards property ownership over the past 20 or 30 years will be seen as an aberration,\" he says. But in order for that to happen, there will have to be a fundamental shift in our attitudes. Somehow, we are going to have to start thinking of houses simply as homes again. And how many of us are ready to do that? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Price of Property, Jon Henley's four-part look at the way the stampede for home ownership has changed Britain, begins at 9pm on Monday on Channel 4.</p>",

  "<p>The \"hysterical rhetoric\" of national politicians trying to satisfy the \"public clamour for prison-based punitiveness\" is criticised today by an inquiry chaired by Cherie Booth QC.</p> <p>The interim report from the Commission on English Prisons Today says local prisons should be handed over to be run by local authorities as an alternative to the \"government's current titanic course\" of building new 2,500-bed prisons which will contribute little to public safety.</p> <p>Booth, the commission's president, said the body was asking whether local government should be given a bigger role in identifying and supporting areas where crime was most problematic, given that much of the crime that is high on the public agenda is generated and felt locally.</p> <p>\"We are examining what this new localism might mean for the penal system and the paper published today outlines areas for debate,\" she said.</p> <p>The commission's paper, published today, says the justice ministry should retain responsibility for overall policy issues, setting minimum standards, and high-security prisons, but all other prisons should be locally controlled.</p> <p>\"To national politicians, caught on the unending treadmill of satisfying a perceived public clamour for prison-based punitiveness that can never be truly appeased ... localism may well offer an exciting opportunity,\" it concludes.</p> <p>The report adds that with the lack of control which communities currently have over their prisons and without any real knowledge of the costs or alternatives involved, it was understandable that an \"out of sight and out of mind\" approach of shutting people away prevailed.</p> <p>The paper says that this lack of local control over criminal justice, the remote nature of courts and prisons, and the \"hysterical rhetoric of politicians attempting to ride the tiger of public opinion\" over criminal justice were fuelling a rising fear of crime and a sense of breakdown of society.</p> <p>Booth pointed to a US initiative in Connecticut, where funds were switched away from jailing people who had committed technical violations of parole or release to providing more resources for probation support, including help with mental health and addiction problems: \"The state found violation rates fell sharply, allowing Connecticut to scrap plans to increase prison places.\"</p> <p>The commission, set up by the Howard League for Penal Reform, includes leading criminologists, judges and penal reformers and will publish its final report next year. </p> <p>The interim report comes out as annual reoffending statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that progress has been made in cutting reoffending rates since 2000.

  "<p>As the co-star of Gigli, with her immortal line \"gobble, gobble, gobble\" Jennifer Lopez can fairly claim to have created the worst film in living memory. She nonetheless runs herself a very close second as star and co-producer of this dismal music-biopic about Puerto Rican legend Hector Lavoe who invented salsa and brought it to New York in the 1970s. Marc Anthony plays Lavoe, and J-Lo herself superciliously plays his wife Puchi, a fiery, vivid sex-bomb with a heckuva temper and a heart made of a yellowish metal not unlike 148-carat solid gold. Pretty much all the silly cliches recently sent up in Judd Apatow's spoof Walk Hard are present and correct, including - incredibly - the one where the still reasonably innocent Lavoe blunders into the lavatory before a gig to find one of his band shooting up: a man who looks up, stunned, into Lavoe's eyes, as if to say: \"Don't do this, bro ... you don't wanna do what I'm doin'...\" Needless to say, he starts doing precisely this, and Puchi finds herself more co-dependent carer than lover. There is something entirely dead about Lopez's performance. No matter how superficially lively she makes it, she is always simply mouthing the lines. Never mind Jenny from the block. Jenny is the block. Of wood.</p>",
  "<p>In a fresh effort to defuse Thailand's political crisis, its cabinet agreed yesterday to hold a referendum hours after the beleaguered prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, again vowed, in a national radio address, that he would not resign.</p> <p>A referendum could be held within 30 days of the senate passing an enabling law. Yesterday Somsak Kietsuranond, the culture minister, confirmed the government had agreed in principle on the vote. </p> <p>A cabinet minister said questions would be asked on whether the government should step down or dissolve parliament.</p> <p>But in a rambling 50-minute address to the nation Samak dashed expectations of his resignation, saying he had a mandate to govern. \"I will not abandon the ship, and I will take responsibility for the crew on board. I can tell you I will not quit. I will not dissolve parliament. I will stay to protect democracy.\"</p> <p>Protesters, who have been camping out in Samak's office grounds since August 26, jeered at the speech and resolved to stay until he met their demand to quit. \"As long as he insists on staying on, we will not go anywhere,\" said Sondhi Limthongkul, a People's Alliance for Democracy leader.</p> <p>The referendum move appears to be an attempt by Samak to regain the initiative. Clashes between the rival groups left one man dead and 43 injured on Tuesday and Samak declared emergency rule in Bangkok. But this failed to alter the status quo as the army refused to forcibly evict the Government House protesters. </p> <p>In his national address Samak confirmed the resignation of his foreign minister, Tej Bunnag, who said he was leaving to care for his ailing wife. But the veteran diplomat has ties to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, whom the anti-government protesters back. Samak also dubbed the People's Alliance for Democracy a \"lawless mob\" and said it was time for Thais to decide which side they were on in the crisis that has pitted the urban elite anti-government demonstrators against the rural poor.</p>",
  "<p>Andrea Pininfarina, who has died aged 51 in a traffic accident in Turin, presided over the most famous and prestigious name in Italian automobile body design. In recent years, the family firm has been affected by the challenges faced by the industry, and at the time of his death, Andrea was seeking a formula to carry its distinguished legacy forward.</p> <p>His grandfather, Battista \"Pinin\" Farina, founded the coachbuilding house of Carrozzeria Pinin Farina in Turin in 1930 (it became Pininfarina when the family name was changed in 1961 by Italian presidential decree) and by the end of the 1950s, he had been largely responsible for establishing the architecture of the modern European car and putting the art and science of Italian automotive design in the world spotlight. His Cisitalia 202 coup\u00e9 remains the only permanent car exhibit in New York's Museum of Modern Art.</p> <p>As the Italian economic miracle gained momentum, and Battista began to think of retirement, his son, Sergio, was tasked with bringing the industry into the modern era of mass series production. In its new automated factory at Grugliasco, Pininfarina could not only scheme on paper and in clay, but also engineer and build it by the thousand. </p> <p>A businessman rather than the artist his father had been, Sergio skilfully steered the firm through the political and legislative machinations of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, forging links with all the great marques of Europe and making the name of Pininfarina increasingly synonymous with Ferrari. Almost every Ferrari road car since the late 1950s has been the work of Pininfarina. </p> <p>Andrea, born in Turin, was the eldest son of Sergio and Giorgia Pininfarina. He graduated from Turin Polytechnic in 1981 as a mechanical engineer and, like his father, gained his first business experience in the US by joining the Fruehauf Corporation, in Indianapolis, in 1982. </p> <p>Andrea took his first position at Pininfarina in 1983 as the programme manager of the Cadillac Allant\u00e9 project. This two-seater luxury convertible was an attempt to challenge Mercedes. General Motors decreed that the bodies should be built, as well as styled, by Pininfarina. The logistics of this $600m deal were extraordinary: Pininfarina built the bodies and then flew them, 56 at a time, on specially equipped Boeing 747s to Michigan, where they were mated with their power trains. To accommodate this \"air bridge\", Turin airport had to be enlarged. </p> <p>It was an inauspicious beginning to Andrea's career, as the Allant\u00e9 body had widely acknowledged quality problems and is mainly remembered for its persistently leaky hood. In 1987 Andrea became the co-general manager of Pininfarina, then, in 1988, general manager. He took the position of managing director in 1994 as his father reverted to a background role. Andrea became chief executive in 2001. </p> <p>Throughout the 1990s, Andrea oversaw important work for the company's traditional customers, such as Ferrari, Fiat and Alfa Romeo, and maintained long-term links with Peugeot, in France. Listed on the Italian stock exchange since 1986, Pininfarina had become a large group with a variety of foreign outposts. It had also expanded beyond cars into industrial design (trams and trains) and corporate work such as its Lavazza coffee machines. Pininfarina even designed the torch for the 2006 winter Olympics in Turin.</p> <p>But automotive work remained the focus, despite the services the boutique Italian styling houses offered becoming much less important to large car manufacturers, which were increasingly developing internal design talent and expertise, even for low-volume models. However, Pininfarina's relationship with Ferrari, and its authorship of a succession of ever more successful models such as the 360, 599GTB and the latest, the California, has maintained the glamour of the name, while many rivals have fallen by the wayside.</p> <p>Lately, Pininfarina has been widely praised for its styling of the Maserati Quattroporte and Granturismo models and has sustained motor-show visitors with a diet of one-off prototypes and dream cars that have always been part of the firm's tradition. His grandfather had built one-off specials for the likes of Brigitte Bardot and Roberto Rossellini in the 1950s and Andrea sanctioned specially commissioned vehicles for customers including the Sultan of Brunei. </p> <p>However, as Andrea knew, these glamour projects would never balance the books. Convertible models for Alfa Romeo, Ford, Mitsubishi and Volvo have kept the 3,500 employees occupied while consultancy work in the motor industries of Korea, China and India have been vigorously pursued, but Pininfarina sustained a \u00a391m loss last year alone. </p> <p>At the time of death, Andrea was in the midst of a financial restructuring of the firm, keeping the creditors at bay as he engineered an \u00a380m recapitalisation that would reduce the family's interest from 55% to around 30%. New investors included the Indian tycoon Ratan Tata and the French financier Vincent Bollor\u00e9, for whom Pininfarina was designing a new electric car.</p> <p>Andrea died as he rode from his house in Montcalieri to his factory at Cambiano on a Vespa scooter. An elderly motorist in a Ford Fiesta failed to give way, killing Andrea instantly when his scooter hit the side of the car.</p> <p>He was married to Cristina Maddalena Pellion di Persano, with whom he had three children, Benedetta, Sergio and Luca. He is survived by his father - still honorary president of Pininfarina - his elder sister Lorenza and younger brother Paolo, who both sit on the board. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Andrea Pininfarina, engineer and industrialist, born June 26 1957; died August 7 2008</p>",

We think \"property\". Or in other words \"investment\". Capital gain, sure-fire winner, right-to-buy, loan-to-value, buy-to-let, remortgage, equity release, rental yield, profit. Lots of it.

And suddenly everyone - government, banks, estate agents, builders, TV producers, and the 70% of us who now own our homes - finds themselves with a strong vested interest in seeing prices continue to spiral upwards.</p> <p>The UK housing market was insanely out of control and plainly unsustainable. What's happening to it now is violent, but basically a good thing: falling prices are necessary, and badly burned banks may have learned something about the long-forgotten art of responsible lending. </p> <p>But is it enough? How long will it really take to break that link, now deeply entrenched in our minds, between home ownership and wealth acquisition (if you even consider it needs to be broken)? </p> <p>What could we do - tax profits on house sales? Somehow make long-term private renting a truly viable alternative to ownership, as it is in large parts of continental Europe? Encourage sensible sale-and-leaseback schemes that mean people can own their homes, or rent them (or a bit of both), without it really mattering much which?</p> <p>It seems to me we need to get back to a place where we think of houses as homes, not get-rich-quick schemes. But from where we now stand, is that possible?</p>",
  "<p>Durham, knowing the weather will probably rule out a result, set out to earn bonus points here yesterday. That the runs came slowly may have been as much a consequence of that limited ambition as it was of Lancashire's bowling, but batting was never easy as Will Smith and Dale Benkenstein ground their way through 55 overs, setting a record partnership for the county against Lancashire of 184 so far. Smith, who finished on 144, had particular reason to be proud of his efforts.</p> <p>Having been left out of the first three championship matches of the season, the former Nottinghamshire batsman is now Durham's top scorer in the competition, with 772 runs at an average of 55.12. \"If anything's made a difference this season, it's making a decision to try and play more instinctively,\" said Smith, who confirmed he is close to agreeing a new two-year contract. \"It was nipping around, especially in the final session, but there is decent pace so you got value for your shots.\"</p> <p>Both batsmen enjoyed good fortune. Benkenstein survived a leg-before appeal from Glenn Chapple, Smith went to 99 with an inside edge and on the delivery after reaching his century when he played back to Francois du Plessis' leg spin, he saw the ball bounce over middle stump.</p> <p>An occasional bowler, Du Plessis got enough turn to make it hard to fathom why Stuart Law waited until the 68th over before calling on him, given the sameness about the Lancashire attack.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most protracted, and painful, farewells in football was confirmed last night when Kevin Keegan finally resigned as the manager of Newcastle United. An increasingly acrimonious three-day stand-off between Keegan and Mike Ashley concluded with the club's billionaire owner refusing to be backed into a corner by the former England coach's demands before forcing him to walk out.</p> <p>A source yesterday revealed that a clause in Keegan's contract made him liable to pay Ashley \u00a32m in compensation if he quit. The club is considering taking legal action to recover that money but Keegan may counter-claim for constructive dismissal.</p> <p>Gus Poyet, Tottenham Hotspur's assistant manager and a close ally of Dennis Wise, Newcastle's powerful director of football, was immediately installed as the favourite to succeed \"King Kev\" but Marcelino Garc\u00eda Toral, the Real Zaragoza coach, is much admired by the club's hierarchy and also looks a strong candidate. Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a's Miguel Angel Lotina and Real Sociedad's Juanma Lillo are other possibilities.</p> <p>Last night protesting Newcastle fans, dismayed by the loss of their beloved \"Messiah\", were seen throwing season tickets into the Tyne, calling for Ashley's head and talking of boycotting the home game against Hull a week tomorrow.</p> <p>Keegan's tenure ended, just eight months after he returned to St James' Park for his second stint as manager to a hero's welcome, with a statement issued by the League Managers' Association.</p> <p>\"I've been working desperately hard to find a way forward with the directors but sadly that has not proved possible,\" he said in that bulletin. \"It's my opinion that a manager must have the right to manage and that clubs should not impose upon any manager any player that he does not want. It remains my fervent wish to see Newcastle United do well in the future and I feel incredibly sorry for the players, staff and, most importantly, the supporters. I have been left with no choice other than to leave.\"</p> <p>That was disputed by Newcastle in a frosty riposte in which they said they were \"sad and disappointed\" by Keegan's action. They added that the former manager had rejected proposals designed to restore harmony. \"The club made it clear to Kevin that if he had any outstanding concerns on its proposals, he should raise them with the club,\" they said. \"The club regrets that Kevin has, instead of taking up that offer, chosen to resign.\"</p> <p>Trouble festered almost from the day, in late January, when Wise and his cohort Tony Jimenez were installed at St James' as Ashley implemented a two-tier continental-style managerial system. Wise's brief was transfers and Keegan's coaching but the latter was distressed to find he had virtually no influence on who was bought and sold, with the final straw coming on transfer deadline day when Newcastle tried to sell Michael Owen and Joey Barton behind his back.</p> <p>Furious rows with Wise and Derek Llambias, the club's managing director, followed on Tuesday. It was the beginning of an impasse between a manager resolutely refusing to resign and an owner, who has been in the United States this week, declining to pay Keegan at least \u00a32m in compensation for dismissing him.</p> <p>With the latter decamping to the north-west, Manchester became the scene of a prolonged final act in which Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the LMA, mediated with Newcastle's board and Keegan's lawyers were briefed for battle. Those lawyers made it clear to Llambias that Keegan wanted to stay as manager but only if he was given full control of transfers and Wise and Jimenez were removed.</p> <p>When this proposal was rejected in a formal letter from Llambias, it became clear that a compromise was impossible. As negotiations shifted to the financial details of Keegan's departure, the manager yesterday spoke to a senior player and told him he would almost certainly not be returning. Newcastle's squad, who almost all liked and enjoyed working with Keegan, were angry that no director explained the situation to them. An agent representing a member of Keegan's squad said: \"The players' morale is at rock bottom.\" </p>",
  "<p>Does power still come out of the barrel of a gun, or, for that matter, out of the nozzle of a petrol pump, in the 21st century? That is the question raised by Russia's actions in Georgia and elsewhere in Europe in recent months. The short answer is yes, but the long answer is likely to be no. The end of Russia's era of energy affluence is already in sight, and the limitations of its still ramshackle military forces are obvious. The leverage given to it by oil, gas, and such military strength as it possesses must inevitably diminish over the coming years. </p> <p>Equally important, Moscow's tactical victory in Georgia has left it isolated. The Russian government looked round the world for applause and support and found none. Other countries expect steadiness and prudence from a great power and, when these are lacking, tend to conclude that it is neither truly great nor truly powerful.</p> <p>Russia's earlier use of energy cuts to signal displeasure to European states whose policies it dislikes, as well as its forced takeovers of foreign enterprises, had already contributed to the picture of an increasingly unreliable and capricious regime. The settlement yesterday of the dispute over TNK-BP, the joint venture which is Russia's third largest oil company, will not much change this image. True the deal could have been more damaging to BP than it actually is, but the affair has still been resolved almost entirely on Russia's terms. </p> <p>It is evident that the United States and Europe have acted less than wisely in dealing with Russia. The project of Nato expansion up to Russia's borders, even though driven in part by the anxieties which new and prospective members entertained about Russia's intentions, might have been conducted with more sensitivity. There are genuine questions about the best way to manage the intricate nationalisms and sub-nationalisms of the Caucasus, on the one hand, and about the proper status in a sensible security system of Ukraine, a country of divided allegiance, on the other, which were pushed aside in the march to a bigger Nato.</p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney, yesterday dispensing rhetoric in both Georgia and Ukraine, was one of the champions of that expansion, and of the United States' plans to install missile batteries in Poland and the Czech republic. These were and are an unnecessary provocation, even though they represent no military threat whatever to Russia. The Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, may pretend otherwise during his current visit to Poland, though he knows he will not be taken seriously. But, whatever the balance of responsibility may have been, from Warsaw to Kiev to Tbilisi, red line was set against red line, and the result is that both sides are now in a quandary. The west does not see itself pulling back those Nato markers, while Russia will not let Nato expansion continue without retaliating in some dangerous and almost certainly counterproductive way. </p> <p>The beginning of wisdom for both sides might be to demilitarise the situation in Georgia, trading a limited, rather than a pointedly lavish, restoration of Georgian forces for a full Russian withdrawal into the enclaves, a large European monitoring presence, and a reduction of Russian troop strength in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The end of it might be an agreement to recognise that, whatever happens over Nato membership for Georgia, some way that is acceptable to both sides must be found of recognising Ukraine's special character and status. </p> <p>But, in an election year concessions are difficult for America, while the Russians are still so full of themselves and their little victory that they have yet to come down to earth. There needs to be a period of reflection on both sides, particularly on the Russian one. Until Russians see that they are as much in danger of making \"a historic mistake,\" in Mr Lavrov's words, as is the west, we will not see much progress.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past 20 months of campaigning Barack Obama's team has built a reputation for discipline: the inner circle decides on a message, passes it down and everyone sticks to it. But since John McCain's introduction of his running mate, the Obama side has shown uncertainty about how to deal with the Sarah Palin phenomenon.</p> <p>\"They blew it, this was not good,\" a prominent Democrat said yesterday. While the anti-George Bush tide in the country would be enough to see Obama into the White House, he argued, the presence of Palin would make the race closer. </p> <p>He felt Obama's side had walked into a Republican mousetrap by demonstrating class and gender prejudice against a modern, middle-class woman.</p> <p>The initial reaction from the Obama team was to criticise McCain for picking someone with so little experience, but a few hours later there was a joint statement from Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, welcoming as historic the Republicans' first woman vice-presidential candidate. </p> <p>Obama's team then joined in the trawl through her background and Biden went on to call her \"good looking\" - a comment many could regard as patronising - before saying her speech lacked substance.</p> <p>The latter is the approach many Democrats thought the Obama team should have taken from the start, presenting the Republicans as the tired old party, short of ideas, in contrast to the Democrats.</p> <p>Tad Devine, chief strategist for the unsuccessful 2004 presidency run by Democratic John Kerry, said yesterday the best way was to point out that Palin \"said practically nothing about the biggest issues of our time\". Like other Democrats, Devine thinks Palin's impact will quickly wane. Vice-presidents normally are only prominent at three points in a campaign: when chosen, at their convention speech, and during the vice-presidential debate. When Biden faces Palin at the debate he will need to balance the desire to show off his experience of foreign affairs against appearing patronising.</p> <p>The task for Democrats is to stop Palin winning over women; they could focus on her social conservatism - her anti-abortion and creationism stances.</p> <p>Devine said he thought it was legitimate for Obama to look at how Palin was appointed by McCain, with the vetting done only the day before, and thought that while her speech would appeal to the Republican base it might not go down so well with the independents, needed by McCain.</p>",
  "<p>Wall Street stocks suffered their sharpest fall for two months yesterday as dismal US employment figures and rumours of hedge fund failures cast a cloud of gloom over trading floors.</p> <p>In a downcast day on both sides of the Atlantic, shares slid amid increased alarm about the perilous condition of the global economy.

Other sectors were also hit by wider economic woes as Marks &amp; Spencer shares fell more than 5% over worries about its trading prospects.</p> <p>The ECB's decision to restrict use of its system to unfreeze the credit market followed concerns that it had been open to misuse. The bank is increasing the price it is charging for banks to swap toxic mortgage-backed securities for more liquid funds from next February. Instead of receiving 98 for 100 of assets, banks will receive 83.60 in some instances under the new rules.</p> <p>The ECB's liquidity package, brought in a year ago when the credit crunch started to bite, was being widely used by banks in Europe and is said to have allowed some banks to adjust to the harsher economic realities. Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank's president, said the changes aimed to improve risk control. \"We don't think it will impair the way the system is functioning and the capacity of the banks to go to our operations,\" Trichet said. </p> <p>American stocks were pressed downwards late in the day by speculation that volatility could claim more hedge fund victims in the wake of this week's closure of a commodities fund run by Ospraie Management.</p> <p>One of New York's best-known hedge funds, Atticus Management which looks after $14bn, was forced to deny that it was selling off its assets. Tim Barakett, its founder, said: \"We've heard these rumours as well and they're not true.\"</p> <p>The technology dominated Nasdaq index fell 74 to 2,259 while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 basket slipped 38 to 1,236 - its fourth straight decline, making it the longest period of losses since January.</p> <p>A steady drip feed of gloomy news has harmed hopes of a swift recovery from the global credit crunch, and a glut of trading statements from retailers in the US gave little cause for optimism. Leading chains such as Target, CostCo, Gap and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch all revealed falls in like-for-like sales in August, although the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, bucked the trend with a 3% increase excluding fuel.</p> <p>\"If you look at the data we have on the US and global economy, things are only getting worse, \" Diane Garnick, a strategist at Invesco in New York, told Bloomberg News.</p> <p>\"That leads me to believe that demand is going to slow down and slow down pretty quickly.\"</p> <p>The market turmoil also came along with a warning that a fully fledged global recession appeared \"unavoidable\" without strong and internationally coordinated action on macroeconomic policy.</p> <p>In its annual trade and development report, the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) said the global economy was teetering on the brink of recession because of the fallout from the financial crisis in the US, the bursting of the housing bubbles in large economies, soaring commodity prices, increasingly restrictive monetary policies and stockmarket volatility.</p> <p>Unctad expects the pace of world output to fall to about 3% in 2008 - almost one percentage point less than in the past two years.</p> <p>The report also said that there was mounting evidence that developing countries, which up until now have remained resilient in the midst of the credit crunch, \"cannot escape the global slowdown\".</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337287754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1772820787_palin-analysis2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A day after her prime-time television debut, Sarah Palin was yesterday hailed as the single most important unifying force behind the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain. The novelty of the self-described hunting, shooting and hockey mum, who also holds down a day job as a political reformer and governor of Alaska - has provided excitement and glamour to a campaign that formerly had trouble electrifying the Republican base.</p> <p>Now, after the party's rapturous response to Palin's speech on Wednesday night, its activists can claim their own rising young star to counter the Democratic party nominee, Barack Obama. </p> <p>\"To have a female vice-presidential nominee for the Republican party is very, very exciting,\" said Ellie Lopez-Bowlan, who heads a Republican women's group in Montrose, Nevada. \"She's refreshing in the fact that she's young, she's a working mother and she's a true conservative - I really appreciate that.\"</p> <p>It is unclear how Republicans will react to Palin once the novelty wears off, or whether they will forgive her a newcomer's mistakes on the campaign trail. But for the moment she is their rationale for going out to win the election for McCain.</p> <p>Republican enthusiasm for Palin has risen even after the questions about her experience, and the steady drip feed of stories about her personal life. Yesterday the McCain campaign furiously denied a National Enquirer story that Palin had had an affair, calling it a \"vicious lie\". \"The smearing of the Palin family must end,\" said a senior adviser, Steve Schmidt. </p> <p>As far as the McCain campaign is concerned, nothing will stop its plan to build on Palin's star role at the convention, deploying her in the white working class small towns around Detroit, Michigan, and the conservative bastion of Colorado Springs. Her first stop on Monday will be in Tampa, Florida.</p> <p>Palin pulls in two important demographics behind McCain: aged 44, she can connect with younger voters who supported his rivals in the Republican primaries, and she exercises a strong appeal to working mothers. She has also galvanised two key components of the Republican base that had been cool to McCain: fiscal conservatives and social conservatives.</p> <p>In her speech to the party convention Palin won wild applause when she talked up her record as a cost-cutting governor of Alaska who sold off the official plane on eBay and got rid of her taxpayer-funded official chef.</p> <p>\"She's something different - out of the box,\" said Mark Bloch, who heads the Wisconsin chapter of the free market organisation Americans for Prosperity. \"There was no enthusiasm before - no real reason to support McCain. There was nothing to fire up the grassroots.\"</p> <p>Palin also struck a chord with conservatives and Republican women by talking about her love for her pregnant daughter, Bristol, 17, and her five-month-old son, Trig, born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>\"I could see immediately how she connects with working families and women who are raising children but also trying to give something back to the community,\" said Colleen Morrone, a mother of three from Pennsylvania. \"I'm definitely more enthusiastic now. It has changed the entire dynamic of the campaign.\" </p> <p>That is what the McCain campaign intended. The excitement she generated was precisely what it needed. After eight disillusioning years of George Bush, the Republican base was demoralised. Fiscal conservatives were angry at the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq war. Evangelicals felt that Bush had not done enough to put religion back in the public sphere. Neither group was thrilled with \"flip-flop\" McCain. </p> <p>McCain initially was preoccupied with trying to win over independent voters and Democrats who were not behind Obama.

  "<p>There's no doubt that Glasvegas have had it tough. Not, it should be clarified, because of their background in Dalmarnock - the deprived district of Glasgow their songs depict as a grim world of violence, broken homes and crime - but because of more recent events. No sooner had their debut single appeared than a bitterly fought contest erupted to find who could burden the quartet with the most ludicrous degree of expectation. The NME was impressively quick off the mark - \"You're going to be the most important British band of your generation,\" said one writer to frontman James Allan, \"You're a poet, a genius.\" But then Alan McGee showed up, eager to prove that when it comes to the making of ludicrous claims on behalf of new bands, there's only one real champion, and it's the man who once announced that 3 Colours Red would sell 5m albums: \"Best band to come out of Scotland in 20 years ... most exciting thing I've heard since the Jesus and Mary Chain in the 80s.\" Scotland's Sunday Herald made a late but patriotic challenge by proclaiming Glasvegas' eponymous debut The Best Scottish Album Ever, but by then McGee was up and running like Usain Bolt: \"Defined an entire decade of UK rock'n'roll with one tune ... change British working class culture ... easily eclipsed every modern band in the UK ...\"</p> <p>It seems miraculous that Allan and co haven't given up and bought a one-way ticket back to Dalmarnock, secure in the knowledge that if their debut album doesn't make them the most important band of their generation, sell more than Oasis, change British working-class culture, end knife crime, boost the property market and thaw relations with Russia it's going to be considered a crushing disappointment. Instead, they're toughing it out, suggesting they believe they have the goods to match the bluster. Certainly, their sound has a ring of vaulting ambition. Glasvegas are most frequently compared to the Jesus and Mary Chain, with whom they share a drummer who plays standing up, a love of 60s girl groups and an aim to replicate Phil Spector's orchestral Wall of Sound production technique using guitars. But the Jesus and Mary Chain used a barrage of feedback as a kind of musical Tipp-Ex, a white blur to cover up shortcomings including stumbling ineptitude and crippling shyness. Glasvegas' guitars produce an expansive, echoing shimmer that seems to have less in common with the Mary Chain's unruly noise than it does with the swirling, epic stadium-friendly textures of U2. That fits with the songwriting, which rejects the Jesus and Mary Chain's diffidence and disaffection in favour of something more impassioned, sung in a Glaswegian brogue so thick it represents a new frontier for regional accents in rock: by contrast, the Proclaimers sound like Maggie Smith in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. </p> <p>When this works, it really works. It's hard to think of a recent single that packs quite the emotional wallop of Daddy's Gone, a divorce saga that shifts from scornful to heartbroken without ever becoming mawkish. At his best, Allan is a fantastic songwriter, willing to tackle tough topics, armed with good tunes, balancing fervour with subtlety: Geraldine sounds like a love song until its protagonist is revealed to be a social worker, Go Square Go's tale of schoolyard violence ends with an ambiguous chant: \"Here we fucking go,\" a phrase that could be either bellicose or weary. </p> <p>But tripping over the line that separates overwhelming from overwrought seems an occupational hazard. The opening Flowers and Football Tops is powerful enough in its own right, the hopeless tenor of the lyric - partly inspired by the murder of Glaswegian teenager Kriss Donald - chafing against the melodic sweetness. It doesn't need to break into an agonised version of You Are My Sunshine to make its point. Stabbed, meanwhile, takes the format of the Shangri-Las' remarkable 1966 single Past, Present and Future, a spoken-word monologue set to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. But while the Shangri Las' track works because the lyrics are oblique - the suggestion that Past, Present and Future might be about a rape victim hangs over the song, a sense of mystery and implication inexorably draws the listener in - everything about Stabbed is deeply prosaic, which means it ends up sounding less like high tragedy than ITV drama. When Allan's monologue ends, you half expect the track to cut to the familiar tones of DCI Mike Jardine of Maryhill CID: \"Taggart, there's been a murrduh.\" </p> <p>There are definitely failings and shortcomings on display here, but they're substantially outweighed by moments when Glasvegas hit their target with a force that makes you believe they might well survive the more outrageous claims being made on their behalf. If they're not the future of rock'n'roll, at least they sound like they have a future. Under the circumstances, that's quite a feat.</p>",
  "<p>To some, Asif Ali Khan Zardari is a corrupt, bullying chancer who was a political liability for his late wife, Benazir Bhutto. To others, the 53-year-old politician is a likeable, experienced and sharp-witted middle-aged man who finally has his chance. For a few, he is all these things at once. One thing is sure: Zardari, who is expected to be elected Pakistan's new president tomorrow, is a highly controversial figure and seems unlikely to be the man who can unite 175 million fractious Pakistanis. </p> <p>\"His first approach is always to make friends - but you wonder when the fist might come out,\" said Najam Sethi, editor of several newspapers. \"He has a kind of natural intelligence and is very charming,\" said one neutral observer who has known Zardari since childhood. \"But it is difficult to know whether his charm is a highly effective act or quite how bright he actually is. He could just be doing a good impression of both.\"</p> <p>Such contradictions seem an integral part of the man. Zardari grew up in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, son of a landlord and unsuccessful cinema owner. As a teenager, he was known primarily for his skill at polo and driving fast, though his disregard for risk sometimes had a positive side. When riding one evening in the mid-1980s with an elite equestrian club on the outskirts of Karachi, a foreign diplomat's daughter rode into a dangerous swamp. \"About 50 people stood around watching as she sank into quicksand,\" a witness told the Guardian. \"Zardari waded in and hauled her out. He's brave.\"</p> <p>His arranged marriage in 1987 to Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of former Pakistani prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, surprised many and brought him into the central current of his nation's turbulent political life. A year later Bhutto led the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) to victory in elections after the military dictator Zia ul-Haq died in a mysterious plane crash. She promised \"food, shelter and clothes\" for the masses. Two years later, her administration was dismissed amid allegations of corruption and incompetence. Zardari was imprisoned on charges of blackmail.</p> <p>Over the next 14 years, Zardari alternated periods of liberty and incarceration. When the PPP regained power in 1993, Bhutto made her husband minister of investment, a controversial decision given the reputation for graft Zardari had acquired during the party's first stint in office. Through the early 1990s he collected a breathtaking range of allegations of corruption, implication in murder, attempted embezzlement and even drug trafficking.</p> <p>After a second, lengthier stint in prison following Bhutto's second fall from power, Zardari was released after lengthy negotiations between the PPP and General Pervez Musharraf, then in power, in 2004. Zardari dismisses the various charges as political smears and, now that Swiss magistrates who seized millions in accounts linked to Bhutto and her husband have dropped their investigations, there is not a single outstanding case against him. \"All through his time in prison he showed an incredible resilience,\" said one journalist who interviewed him repeatedly. \"He always seemed sure the tide would turn.\"</p> <p>No one doubts that Zardari is a survivor. Released in 2004, he kept a low profile, undergoing medical treatment in America and only getting involved in active politics shortly before his wife's return to Pakistan in October last year. His reappearance at strategy planning sessions in London dismayed many PPP stalwarts. Power has earned him more supporters, however. \"He's an older and wiser man. He's got health problems, he watches his diet, he doesn't drink any longer,\" said a Pakistani political activist. \"He and Benazir were both very young when they came to power. They made mistakes.\"</p> <p>A former close associate from the early 1990s spoke, with no obvious irony given the frequent charges of egregious nepotism levelled at Zardari, of how Bhutto's widower \"always goes out of his way to help out his friends and even those who somehow reach him for help for jobs, financial help etcetera\". But others describe an arrogant, uncultivated and often impatient man ruthless with his enemies. Some accuse Zardari of frequent personal abuse of subordinates. An ally who preferred to remain anonymous said: \"He is not a man you want to be on the wrong side of.\"</p> <p>Twenty years' experience has taught Zardari much about the brutal game of Pakistani politics. When his wife died, he moved swiftly to secure control of the PPP, sidelining his son and skilfully assuming the Bhutto mantle. However, Zardari is far from an intellectual and does not share his late wife's profound interest in geopolitics or economics, nor her education, eloquence or charisma.</p> <p>\"He doesn't read much, it's true,\" said an ally. \"But you don't necessarily need to be a bookworm type to be president of Pakistan.\" In the Zardari camp there is quiet jubilation. Few predicted this victory. Zardari will savour it.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> July 26 1955 in Nawabshah, Pakistan</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married Benazir Bhutto in 1987 (she was assassinated in 2007), three children, Bilawal, Bakhtwar and Aseefa</p> <p><strong>Political career</strong> Member national assembly 1990-93 and 1993-96; federal minister of the environment 1993-1996; federal minister of investment 1995-96; transformed the power sector by encouraging investment opportunities.

  "<p>Having lived in Brazil for the past 12 years, I am not surprised by Tom Phillips' article (Deforestation rises sharply as farmers push into Amazon, September 1). The Brazilian government refuses to take practical steps to prevent this and simply makes the right noises of despair about a situation it allows to continue. If pressed, it argues that \"developed\" nations progressed by cutting down their forests, so complaints are some kind of conspiracy to limit Brazil's development. This ignores the facts that: Europe and the US cut down forests when charcoal was the standard fuel for industry; huge areas of Europe and the US have been reforested; vast areas of deforested land in Brazil are left unused and Brazil is ignoring its plentiful alternative sources of solar energy.</p> <p>The world seems to be unaware of the universal corruption in Brazil under the present government (almost all the senior figures in the Workers' party who came to office with the current president have had to be replaced for various misdemeanours) and this extends into the area of environmental destruction - officials charged with preserving the rainforests are intimidated or worse. Also, the forces of law and order in that area are woefully under-equipped. An American missionary was murdered recently for working against exploitation of rainforest lands and those responsible for ordering the killing are still free. This case was publicised because the victim was American - smaller fry are murdered with equal impunity but less publicity. On September 7 we shall celebrate the country's national day, when the armed forces will parade in pomp rather than working to protect the country's wonderful natural resources against environmental looters.<br><strong>Graham Howells</strong><br>University of Brasilia</p>",
  "<p>The grand houses. The glorious interiors. The awe-inspiring lobbies and entrances with marble flooring washed with natural light. The candlelit ballrooms densely populated by simpering ladies and gossiping 18th-century politicians. The wigs. The Whigs. The elegant country houses, from whose drawing rooms ambitious mothers can thoughtfully watch their beautiful, innocent daughters romping ingenuously on the wonderful lawns. All of it murmurs \"England\", and the whole thing is so excessively English that I half-expected the usherette to check my National Trust membership card at any moment. Boris Johnson might well feel like bringing Keira and her bewigged and powdered crew on for the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. </p> <p>Director Saul Dibb smoothly orchestrates these elements in his stately, measured pageant-drama, starring Keira Knightley as Georgiana (counter-intuitively pronounced Jaw-jain-a), Duchess of Devonshire, n\u00e9e Spencer, the brilliant but broken-hearted political hostess and courageous wronged woman whose life story, with a little tweaking, resembles that of her 20th-century descendant: our own Queen of Hearts, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. </p> <p>Once again, Keira is playing at the comfortable upper reaches of the social register, though without the thin, shrill edge of neurosis that made her performance compelling in Atonement, nor yet the loose, jaunty, sisterly swing that made her so attractive in Pride and Prejudice. Her lips are once again perennially shaped to express something between a pout and a moue, but those panda eyebrows are rarely raised in surprise. She is the simple girl whose steely-eyed mama (a shrewd, poised performance from Charlotte Rampling) pairs her off with the fabulously wealthy and powerful Duke of Devonshire, played with a kind of clenched glumness by Ralph Fiennes. Like many Englishmen of that time and ours, he is emotionally animated only by animals: in this case, his beloved dogs. </p> <p>At first shy and lonely, Georgiana discovers that she is loved by the people and by high society alike; she blossoms and makes her husband look a dullard. But the duke breaks her heart with his indiscretions, including an affair with Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) - and so Georgiana finds herself submitting to the attentions of the handsome Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). It was, to coin a phrase, very crowded in that marriage, and once the facts are presented in this light, Georgiana does indeed start to look like Diana. </p> <p>What is frustrating is that the movie does not give Knightley much of a chance to show the progression of her character: from simple teenager to racy society woman with a weakness for wine and gambling and finally to battle-hardened mother, a person who now knows what is really important in this world and who is dedicated to staying with her children at all costs. We need to see Georgiana develop as a person, see her grow up, grow old even. Frankly, this doesn't happen, though I sensed that Knightley could have achieved this, had the script and direction allowed it. </p> <p>I must also say that I am turning from agnostic to atheist when it comes to Ralph Fiennes' performance. He plays the entire thing with a look of thin-lipped, fastidious despair - and a face like a wet weekend in Wigan. It's appropriate for the role, arguably, but where is the passion he's supposed to feel for Bess? The nearest we get to it is hearing their cries of illicit passion behind the bedroom door, but we stay outside, with Georgiana, as she listens, stunned by his unfaithfulness. I would have loved to see a genuine, clothes-on, love scene between Ralph Fiennes and Hayley Atwell. This, however, might have meant upstaging the leading lady. </p> <p>Georgiana moves in racy social and political circles; Simon McBurney plays the turbulent radical Charles James Fox and Aidan McArdle is Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the dramatist whose School for Scandal was evidently inspired directly by the Devonshires' notoriously unstable marriage. Both men enjoy her friendship, but again, there is no sense that politics really means all that much to Georgiana other than with one pretty feeble squeak about female suffrage over the port one evening. </p> <p>Then there is the gambling - something to which the real-life Duchess was, if not addicted exactly, sufficiently devoted to run through a very large amount of her cash, leaving her reportedly broke at the end of her life. This Georgiana's gambling looks like a genteel flutter. Betting and politics are shown as male adventures on which Georgiana is content to take a free ride. Her frizzy coiffure is shown disturbed at one stage - in fact, her wig catches fire, which is more than her performance does - but Georgiana seems perplexingly submissive, even when supposedly at the height of her career. </p> <p>Dibb's movie looks good, but there is something exasperatingly bland and slow-moving at all times. Unlike the heroine, he never takes much of a risk.</p>",
  "<p>The Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, had to publicly deny yesterday that he was being forced out of his job as controversy over his leadership continued to haunt him.</p> <p>Blair made a statement outside Scotland Yard saying that \"the report of my death is an exaggeration\" following a newspaper story claiming that detailed plans were being drawn up to oust him.</p> <p>Since he took over in February 2005, Blair has faced troubled times dealing with Britain's first suicide bombings, the shooting dead of an innocent man in the aftermath of the second wave of attacks, continued whisperings about his lack of leadership and most recently accusations of racism by a senior colleague.</p> <p>Blair, whose contract expires in February 2010, spoke out after the Times suggested detailed plans to replace him were being drawn up by the Home Office and the Metropolitan police authority.</p> <p>The report said he was due to receive a letter this week from the MPA informing him whether his contract will be renewed. It said there was no backing for that to happen and the MPA was believed to be drawing up a letter notifying him that his contract would not be renewed.</p> <p>This would be a blow to Blair, who has refused previous calls to stand down following the fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005, and has made it plain he wants to lead the Met during the Olympics in 2012.</p> <p>But the commissioner was defiant yesterday. After returning from his summer holiday he stood outside Scotland Yard and said: \"I have a job to do and I am going on with it and will continue to do so.\"</p> <p>He added that the story had no basis in fact and said he did not expect to enter into any discussions about the possible extension of his term until the middle of next year.</p> <p>Scotland Yard, in a further statement, said: \"No discussions have taken place about his contract. The commissioner still has 18 months to serve on his original contract and has had no discussions with anyone about this being extended. He has received no correspondence on this matter.\"</p> <p>It is known, however, that support has shifted within the Yard from Blair to his deputy, Sir Paul Stephenson, who is seen as a safe pair of hands after a turbulent three years under Blair.</p> <p>It was Deputy Commissioner Stephenson who fronted the Met's response to an allegation of racism from Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur this summer. Ghaffur has launched a racial discrimination claim against the Met accusing Blair personally of bias.</p> <p>In a statement on the tribunal claim, Stephenson took a firm stance, saying it was time for everyone to \"shut up\" and get on with their jobs.</p> <p>Blair has also faced accusations this summer that there were possible irregularities over the awarding of contracts to one of his friends. </p> <p>Senior officers have spoken privately about the lack of support for Blair and there is likely to be a further falling away of confidence during the inquest later this month into De Menezes's death.</p> <p>It is expected that bitter divisions will be revealed within the force about who was to blame and serious questions are likely to be raised about the running of the operation that led to the fatal shooting. De Menezes, a 27-year-old electrician, was shot dead by firearms officers at Stockwell tube, south London, on July 22 2005 after he was mistaken for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>The Home Office said yesterday that the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, had full confidence in Blair. In a statement the Association of Chief Police Officers said he had its full support. \"He and his team need to be given the space to get on with the job of keeping London safe.\"</p> <p>The MPA denied a letter had been sent to Blair. A spokesman said no letters had been or were about to be sent to the Met chief.</p> <h2>Frontrunners for job</h2> <p><strong>Sir Paul Stephenson</strong>, 54, Met deputy commissioner since 2005.

  "<p>A life-prolonging drug available to cancer patients in Europe, America and elsewhere in England is being withheld from a Sussex man because his health authority has misunderstood medical test data, the high court heard yesterday.</p> <p>An application by 55-year-old Colin Ross represented an \"end of the road\" legal challenge that, if successful, could extend his life by three years, his lawyers argued. They added that failure to secure the treatment would condemn him to death within the next few months.</p> <p>The case focuses on Revlimid, a relatively new chemotherapy developed to help those with cancer in their blood plasma cells. It is prescribed to people no longer able to cope with the severe side-effects of another drug, thalidomide.</p> <p>The case is a clear example of the NHS's postcode lottery when it comes to availability of medicines, the court heard. Other patients in England have been given Revlimid - also known as Lenalidomide - including one who lives in a different health authority district only a few miles from Ross's home in Horsham. </p> <p>Richard Clayton QC, representing Ross, challenged the legal basis of the decision by West Sussex PCT to refuse treatment, claiming that its interpretation of the term \"exceptional need\" would require every qualifying case to be unique.</p> <p>Ross, who is a grandfather and looks after a partner recently diagnosed with breast cancer, has given up taking thalidomide because of the side-effects and is only receiving palliative drugs. He relies on sticks to help him walk. He sat in the courtroom listening to all the evidence.</p> <p>His application is supported by cancer specialist Prof Karol Sikora of Imperial College London, who described him as \"eminently suitable\" for treatment. Ross's doctors are seeking permission to use three or four courses of the drug, likely to cost a total of around \u00a320,000.</p> <p>\"This is not a case [that will open the] floodgates,\" Clayton told the high court. \"It's not a routine drug that will generate enormous resource implications. </p> <p>In a recent survey, it was found that 60% of applications for [Revlimid] have succeeded in applications for exceptional funding. Because of the adverse side-effects of thalidomide, [Ross] has ceased to have any life-prolonging treatment. </p> <p>\"This is the end of the road for him unless he gets the drug. If the claimant were to live one and a half miles away from where he does, he would get the drug.\"</p> <p>West Sussex PCT, Clayton said, had misunderstood the medical data. \"None of the [adjudicating panel] appeared to have specialist expertise in treating myeloma [blood cancer],\" Clayton said. \"The lack of oncology experts makes it difficult to apply scrutiny to new drugs.\"</p> <p>One of the health authority's officials had described Revlimid as merely \"promising\" when it had already been granted a licence by the Food and Drug Administration in the US on the basis of strict, randomised control trials, the court heard.</p> <p>The health authority panel was also said to have misinterpreted what appeared to be a relatively marginal improvement in survival rates. In fact, the figures showed the trial was so successful that it was \"unblinded\" and those taking a control substitute switched to Revlimid.</p> <p>The authority's contention that its network chemotherapy group had not approved the use of the drug was mistaken too, Clayton told Judge Simon Grenfell.</p> <p>Martin Forde QC, appearing for the trust, said its officials had \"every sympathy\" for Ross's predicament but were having to make \"agonising decisions\" and consider 600 similar cases every year. The PCT was doing its level best to use limited NHS funds \"in the most efficient manner to benefit the largest number of patients\". In Ross's case, it did not accept that it had adopted an irrational funding policy.</p> <p>The case is a significant challenge to health authorities' interpretation of guidelines surrounding the rationing of drugs not yet approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The hearing continues on Monday. The judge indicated that he hopes to give his ruling by the middle of next week.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 8 2008. In the US the Food and Drug Administration approves drugs, not the Federal Drugs Agency as we previously said. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Spa-Francorchamps brought mixed emotions for Lewis Hamilton yesterday when he began preparations for Sunday's Belgian grand prix. Twelve months ago the spotlight was less on the race and more on a sombre courtroom in Paris where the governing body, the FIA, delivered a $100m (\u00a350m) fine for the part played by McLaren-Mercedes in a \"spying\" drama. </p> <p>Hamilton's team were also stripped of their championship points, all of which scarcely contributed to a calm and focused atmosphere as McLaren prepared to continue their tense contest with Ferrari on the track. \"Last year, when I walked the track, I didn't know if I would be racing because of everything that was going on,\" said Hamilton. \"But this year we don't have any of those stresses.\" </p> <p>The atmosphere could not have been more different yesterday. Ferrari and McLaren are once again neck-and-neck in their fight for the championship with six races to go. But apart from being able to concentrate fully on the job in hand Hamilton has also learned how to cope with the challenges of the closing phase of the season.</p> <p>\"Last year I had to take one race at a time and that was a good approach because I didn't know what to expect,\" he said. \"I didn't know how to last the whole season mentally. This year, having had that experience, I know more about what I want from the car. I know the ins and outs of the game a lot better. My approach is a lot more controlled than last year. I still plan on winning, but scoring points by making sensible decisions at the time.\"</p> <p>Even though he prefers not to discuss it, Hamilton is aware that Ferrari are on the back foot following engine failures for Felipe Massa and Kimi Raikkonen in the past two races.</p> <p>\"When it comes to rivals you obviously know they're there and you look at where they are quicker than you and you try to beat them,\" said Hamilton. \"They've got their problems. I'm not wishing anyone bad luck. All I know is that I'm strong and intend to stay that way for the rest of the season.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, flies ever nearer to the sun. The wax is melting. The wings are about to droop. The cause of his impending doom is our old and deadly friend, fiscal reform. Like Margaret Thatcher before him, Salmond's downfall will date from the day he began to meddle with Scottish taxes.</p> <p>On Wednesday Salmond rose in the Scottish parliament and proposed a \"local\" income tax. It is no such thing. The much vaunted replacement for council tax is not local but national, unless Salmond has done a volte face and now regards Scotland as not a nation. He wants a 3p surcharge on the basic rate of United Kingdom income tax for all Scottish residents.</p> <p>The property tax fixed by individual councils will be abolished and all sub-national accountability with it. Scotland's 32 area authorities will be allotted their total revenue by Edinburgh, a degree of fiscal centralism unknown in any other country in Europe. It is ironic beyond belief that the first part of Great Britain to enjoy serious democratic devolution should use it to kill off democratic devolution within its borders.</p> <p>Salmond is about to achieve what Nigel Lawson, Kenneth Clarke and Gordon Brown failed to do: kill off a chunk of British local government and render local authorities mere delegates of central power. He wishes to concentrate control in his office and ensure that Scotland's counties, boroughs and communities have no say over their services or spending priorities. This is precisely the flexibility he as Scottish National party leader demanded and got from London. A man who, with London's Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, has done so much to revitalise local politics in Britain has become a hypocrite.</p> <p>There must be a more progressive structure of local taxation in Britain. Otherwise decentralisation is simply impossible. Such taxation must reflect ability to pay, and on a wider basis than house values. A proper local income tax is sound. It has underpinned welfare advance - and satisfaction with local services - across northern Europe. Britain's reliance on a property tax alone as a source of local revenue has plunged fiscal policy into turmoil for a quarter of a century. It felled Thatcher and bedevilled the reforms of John Major and Tony Blair. As a result local taxes now cover a mere 5% of public revenue, lower than in any western democracy. Yet even that 5% leads to howls of rage, sending little old ladies and vicars to prison each year. It is crazy.</p> <p>Salmond was right to push ahead with a supplementary income tax, but wrong to nationalise it and abolish all other forms of local taxation. His claim that a true local income tax would have been \"overly complex and burdensome to collect\" is rubbish. Other countries seem to manage it. If Scotland cannot handle this, it does not say much for its capacity for self-rule.</p> <p>The objections to Salmond's proposal are legion. Even the most favourable analysis suggests that 3p on incomes will leave a \u00a3750m gap after the removal of the council tax. The requisite level would be about 4.5p. That is above the Edinburgh parliament's discretion, and London is unlikely to move on this.</p> <p>Nor will London continue to send \u00a3400m north of border that previously financed council tax rebates for the poor. The very poor will not be paying Salmond's extra tax. As for his claim that another \u00a3400m of \"efficiency savings\" can be made, that is hooey from a man who splurges money on student fees, care charges and prescriptions.</p> <p>Nor will the politics be easy. With the starting threshold at \u00a35,435, Salmond will find himself taxing 55,000 working students, yet excusing the rich on unearned incomes. He will find it hard to tax second-homers and non-residents with a charge unrelated to property. English owners of Scottish estates will get off scot free. Meanwhile, a property tax register must remain in place for water rates, so there will be minimal saving on collection.</p> <p>The allocation of the tax will also be controversial. At present local councillors work out what they need within agreed spending targets, but have some discretion in fixing council tax levels thereafter. If voters do not like it, they can vote them out of office, and often do. Now all revenue will come from the centre. On Wednesday a spokesman claimed that revenue \"will stay in the area where it is raised\", but this is meaningless. Local income taxes, like most taxes, must be redistributed so rich areas contribute to poor ones. The Scottish tax will not be fixed locally, and will be apportioned nationally. Local accountability will be zero. The great city of Glasgow will become an agency of the Edinburgh civil service.</p> <p>Neither Salmond's sums nor his politics make sense. Like Thatcher, he is about to learn the hard way that abolishing property taxes may offer political jam today but wormwood tomorrow. To tax and to please, as Burke said, \"no more than to love and to be wise\" is not given to men.</p> <p>The tragedy is that here was a real opportunity to break down the barrier against sane fiscal reform. Scotland could have built on its devolution base to show England - and Wales - what decentralisation really means: the path to democratic revival.</p> <p>Salmond could have taken a leaf from the book of other world democracies, especially those of a similar size to Scotland whose public services are manifestly better run. In Denmark, local spending is now two-thirds of public spending, against about a quarter in Britain. This is financed roughly 65% by local income tax, 15% by a property tax and 20% by central grant. These proportions are redistributed so as to retain local discretion while minimising \"postcode lotteries\". Denmark is not known for abject poverty or revolutionary uprisings as a result.</p> <p>Salmond should retain his council tax but roughly halve it. He should then let councils set their own income taxes up to his 3p cap. He should also adopt the admirable equity-release scheme devised by the Scottish economist David Bell for elderly home owners, excusing them local taxes for life in return for a death duty charge on their homes. This sort of imagination should be possible under devolution.</p> <p>There is one shaft of light. Localism's fair-weather friends, the Liberal Democrats, have a whip hand over Salmond's administration. Usually they dither and dive for cover. Here they could be blunt: Salmond's income tax is excellent but should be local not national; there should be a mix of local revenue sources, devolved to Scotland's 32 councils after a measure of equitable redistribution.</p> <p>Such devolution was the basis of Salmond's rise to power. He has since become a control freak, deciding every minutia of his welfare state down to fixing drink prices and hospital parking charges. He is Thatcher in a kilt. If Scotland is ever to be a model small-state democracy, someone must call Salmond's bluff.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes the best weapon for puritans is self-censorship by others. The AQA exam board has withdrawn from its syllabus a poem by Carol Ann Duffy, in which a teenage narrator squashes an insect, kills a goldfish and then walks out on to the streets with a breadknife.</p> <p>The clear fear of the question-setters is that verse about violence with a blade may encourage children to take the textbook as a handbook and check out the kitchen drawer at home. And so the banned poem re-opens the debate about the copycat risks of fiction.</p> <p>That particular F-word is a good place to begin. This is in part about a misunderstanding of poetry. While we easily appreciate that a novel or short story is invented, we tend to take verse as autobiography, reportage or even instruction - partly because many poems, including Duffy's, are framed in the first person, and because phrases are dragged out of their stanzas to become slogans and mottos, so that \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" or \"They fuck you up, your mum and dad\" becomes a higher kind of lapel badge. But poems are fiction as well, and \"I\" may not mean him or her: the poet laureate, Andrew Motion, has admitted to writing mock-autobiographical verse that contradicts the details he has set down in memoir.</p> <p>Poems are often brief and ambiguous. Exam boards might more easily tolerate a novel about an adolescent who considers stabbing someone, because 200 or so pages would probably encompass debate, payoff and a clear message distancing the author from their character. Duffy's dozen or so lines present a snapshot of someone about to snap, but the fact that the piece enters the mind of a violent person does not mean it's in favour of stabbing. And the perfect place to make this clear is the classroom. Any good English teacher would get the students talking about the situation Duffy depicts. Why does the narrator feel this way? Is he crazy? Isn't he going to end up dead or jailed? Have we ever felt like him - or, indeed, her? Interestingly, although most commentary has assumed that the narrator is male, Duffy never specifies this, which perhaps shows what a subtle form poetry can be.</p> <p>It's easy to ridicule the AQA decision with rhetorical exaggeration. Better ban Macbeth in case year 11 march on Balmoral and slay the monarch. And censor Pride and Prejudice, because the girls might sit around waiting for their parents to find a husband for them. And don't let them read Alan Sillitoe in case the school's best runners throw the race at the next athletics meet.</p> <p>Yet libertarians must acknowledge that the Duffy fuss is not as silly as that. There has been a legitimate concern that knife-crime in films or video games may encourage imitation, but I would argue that, in those cases, the danger is that young viewers are experiencing the scenes in isolation and as entertainment. Discussing violent urges in an educational context is clearly different.</p> <p>I realise that this idealised classroom scenario pushes teachers into the role of social workers, charged with making sure that students do not take Duffy's words as a memo rather than a poem. But any text can be lethally misunderstood. The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger has - in the case of John Lennon's assassin - tipped an unbalanced mind towards murder. Hardy's Jude The Obscure could plant the idea of suicide in a troubled head. But any such text becomes less dangerous when read at school, because a perverse interpretation of the work can be challenged.</p> <p>Duffy was reportedly rejected as a potential laureate a decade ago because some bookshops put her books in the gay and lesbian section. With Motion's successor to be selected soon, it would be shameful if the ludicrous implication that her lines glamorise knives made her politically untouchable again.<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"><br>comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Ruth Watson, Channel Five's Hotel Inspector, puts it pithily: \"I'd happily forego the hotel proprietor who tells me he'll bring me biscuits in bed for a box no one gives a shit I'm in but which is spanking clean.\"</p> <p>Independent hotels would blanch at the picture she paints, but you get her gist, and no brand exemplifies the latter approach quite like Premier Inn.</p> <p>While the leisure market is traditionally built on the warm welcome offered by a team keen to anticipate your every whim, for many the charm of staying at a Premier Inn is its sheer anonymity. Each room is a clone of the last, its contents pared down to the very basics, at a price tempting to a transitory clientele on its way somewhere else.</p> <p>Concerns about period character, central location or engaging design have been thrown out of the window, and with them the flounces and frills that can alienate travellers keen to get in and out with minimum fuss.</p> <p>Instead the brand has focused on the basics it believes the road-weary customer on a budget will put first: a spotless en suite bathroom, brightly lit work desk and, perhaps most importantly, a king-size bed from which to control the flat-screen TV.</p> <p>Consistency is key. A rigorous feedback programme enables Premier Inn to maintain tight quality control - ensuring every piece of literature is compatible with the company's ethos, every item branded, every worker on-message. Staff are friendly, parking ample and beds soft, but it's perhaps a more seductive offer that has put Premier Inn at the top: the chance for frazzled travellers to be treated as a number for the duration of their stay.</p> <p>Yesterday's figures from Whitbread suggest that Watson isn't alone in enjoying a quick fix to the problem of where to stay. Squeaky clean, predictable and affordable, a night at a Premier Inn won't fill you with lust for life, but it is a pretty good place to lay your head for a night.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Anna Blewett is editor of Hotel Business magazine</p>",
  "<p>Danny and Oxide Pang made their directing debut at the beginning of the decade with a smart and unusual Bangkok-set thriller about a deaf-mute Thai hitman called Kong, who was drawn to the profession because his condition meant he could never flinch at the firing of a gun. The Pang brothers have remade that movie for Hollywood with Nicolas Cage in the lead; it is now macho-ed up and made far more conventional, with the unusual aspects removed - a removal that clots and slows the movie. Cage's character is not hearing-impaired; he is your standard-issue tough guy, a samurai of assassination here in the Thai capital to do a job. No, it is his girlfriend who is deaf-mute - a young Thai pharmacy assistant for whom he conceives a thoroughly implausible tendresse. Devolving his disability on to a female character is both condescending and slows the storyline. Rather insultingly for Thai audiences, the Kong character now appears to be Cage's sidekick. There are some flashy sequences, which can't conceal the essential silliness and fatuity. </p>",
  "<p>There was no shortage of excited reaction when Alistair Darling told Saturday's Guardian that economic conditions were \"arguably the most difficult in 60 years\". But the one audience he surely hoped would listen was the rate-setting committee of the Bank of England, whose passivity during the current slowdown is causing the first real rift with Whitehall since Bank independence. Yesterday, the committee again kept rates on hold. The chancellor's message, if that is what it was, had failed to get through.</p> <p>The decision came on the day the Halifax reported the biggest fall in house prices ever, and as we learned that the number of new cars sold this August was lower than it had been since 1966 - a time before the world had heard of Lovely Rita, when motoring was still a minority pursuit. If the announcement had come another day, some other indicator would have provided the grim backdrop instead. Whether it is business services, pub profits or computer store sales, as the autumn takes hold the bad figures in the morning news keep cropping up like mushrooms. </p> <p>The Bank is well aware that all economic compasses are now pointing south: one committee member, David Blanchflower, has been arguing for some time that the cost of borrowing must be cut aggressively to ameliorate the slump. But, until now at least, fears of stoking resurgent inflation - which is 4.4% and rising - have paralysed the majority of his colleagues. One of them, Charles Bean, has compared current dilemmas to those of the 1970s, and the Confederation of British Industry's surprisingly positive reaction to Bank inaction yesterday is another reflection of how the wage-price spiral of the glam rock years continues to haunt the economic establishment. This fear would be perfectly justified if wages were racing ahead, but when average pay rises are lagging behind living costs it borders on superstition. With oil prices in freefall the question is not if but when inflation will begin to decline.</p> <p>Central bankers, however, are a cautious bunch, and their narrow duty to target inflation makes them even less likely to take any risks. The 2% inflation target was supposed to encourage a balanced approach, as undershooting in a slump is treated as seriously as overshooting in a boom. Until recently, it worked well, but what has pushed prices up lately are global commodity markets over which the Bank has no control - all it can do, as it is doing, is offset their effect on prices by punishing the wider economy. </p> <p>The Bank's remit worked well until recently, but it is not doing so now. It was not discovered on tablets of stone, but written by Gordon Brown. It is time to revisit the remit again, and - if need be - to refine it.</p>",
  "<p>Changing trainers has provided Amir Khan with a reality check and convinced him he still has much to learn before he fulfils his potential, the undefeated Commonwealth lightweight champion admitted yesterday as he prepares to face the undefeated Colombian Breidis Prescott at Manchester's MEN Arena tomorrow night. </p> <p>For the last two months the 21-year-old Khan has been working with the Cuban Jorge Rubio after first dispensing with the services of the Salford trainer Oliver Harrison - with whom he had a three-year association - and then stand-in trainer Dean Powell, who oversaw Khan's preparations for his last victory over Michael Gomez in June. </p> <p>\"It has been back to basics. I have been cleaning up my mistakes,\" Khan said. \"I feel like I am a new fighter. I know now that I am not the complete article. I knew I was making mistakes, but Oliver [Harrison] would let it ride. Oliver and Dean Powell didn't tell me what I was doing wrong.\"</p> <p>Clearly, Khan has quickly established a rapport with Rubio, once a top trainer of the formidable Cuban amateur team and now affectionately referred to by Khan and his camp as \"George\". After just two sessions working with Rubio at his gym in Miami, Khan had taken the decision that he wanted him as his trainer. </p> <p>\"Straight away, he told me the mistakes I was making. He made me keep my hands up, and keep my head moving. We have been working on body shots, on different combinations and everything started flowing. And he's hit me, hard, when we have been working on the pads,\" said Khan. </p> <p>\"I've had knocks and grazes because I kept dropping my hand low after I threw the jab. Every time I did it, he'd give me a whack. He's quick. And he kept hitting me, repeatedly, every time I did it, showing me what I was doing wrong until I didn't do it any more and kept my gloves up.\"</p> <p>Rubio said he will need time to transform Khan into the rounded fighter who will be ready to fight for a world title, but he has already seen enough to convince him of Khan's potential and that, once the rough edges are smoothed off, he has a fighter to rank with the best. </p> <p>\"I have been working him very hard, but he is a talent. I want him to keep his speed, but also put in more power, to work the body and not be so ready to back off. At the moment he's maybe 90% of the fighter he can be. In the future he can be world No1 and win a world title,\" said Rubio.</p>",
  "<p>Only the cold-hearted could have failed to smile when it was announced Jimmy Bullard had been selected for England. A player of notable talent, application and humour, the midfielder has finally made it to the top having battled through non-league football and a career-threatening injury along the way. But as is the case with the international game, for every player chosen there is at least one who will feel hard done by.</p> <p>In England's case, however, that could well extend to an entire generation. At Wembley tonight the Under-21 side will play Portugal in a match which, should they avoid defeat, will see them top their qualifying group for next summer's European Championship in Sweden.</p> <p>The team have been imperious in getting to this stage without defeat in their seven matches, conceding only one goal and scoring 15. It is little wonder, then, that the manager Stuart Pearce believes that should they make it, England can go at least one better in 2009 than they did in 2007, and reach the final.</p> <p>Rewarding as that would be for the most of the squad, ultimately it is not what they are all seeking. Every player at Under-21 level hopes his performance will some day encourage the manager of the senior team to pick him.</p> <p>Since taking over, Fabio Capello has introduced five Under-21 players into his squad - Joe Hart, Joe Lewis, David Wheater, Tom Huddlestone and Gabriel Agbonlahor - but like the rest who have emerged since the 2007 tournament, when England lost on penalties to the hosts and winners Holland, they made little or no impact.</p> <p>Indeed every one of Capello's full side that started in the 2-2 draw with Czech Republic last month has been a full international for at least four years and while Hart and Theo Walcott, two members of Pearce's set-up, were on the bench that night, neither played. </p> <p>If they were slightly disheartened that night, the Under-21s could be forgiven for throwing their boots in disgust upon hearing the news that Bullard, a 29-year-old who has never played at any international level, had gone straight into the full squad. \"It's the manager's decision [to pick Bullard]. Whatever he says, goes,\" said Mark Noble yesterday on the eve of earning his 12th cap. \"In fairness, Jimmy was fantastic for Fulham last season and has been doing well again this season. If anyone deserves their chance, it is him.\"</p> <p>Club form is an obvious route to international recognition but what may well worry Noble and the rest of the squad is that it is seemingly becoming the only way in. </p> <p>Three of the players who will start tonight, James Milner, Huddlestone and Steven Taylor, are on the Under-21s' all-time appearances list - Milner is top with 36 - but not one has a full cap. The careers of others in that 10, such as Scott Carson, Gareth Barry, Jamie Carragher and Jermain Defoe, would give them hope. On the other hand those of David Prutton, Jermaine Pennant and Nigel Reo-Coker would leave them deeply pessimistic. </p> <p>\"For every Under-21 game so far, someone from the senior set-up has been in attendance,\" said Pearce. \"Fabio [Capello] has even come into the dressing room afterwards, when he has been able to, and spoken to the players. In terms of progressing to the seniors, that has given them a big lift. </p> <p>\"Fabio, undoubtedly, has a keen interest in the Under-21 side. I see him at Soho Square all the time and he always wants to know who is doing well for me and who may be ready to step up. Most of the time he already knows who is doing well and is just asking the question to check how much you know about football.\"</p> <p>Pearce remains optimistic that some of his current squad will eventually get a chance with the big boys that he arranged for tonight's match to be played at Wembley. \"We don't want these players to get to the senior side and never have experience of playing there,\" he said. </p> <p>The way things are going with Capello's squad, they may be waiting a long time.</p> <h2>Fast track or slow lane?</h2> <p><strong>Five players from the 2007 European Championship squad who have been called up to the senior squad</strong></p> <p>Scott Carson 23 (age) 29 (caps)</p> <p>Joe Hart 21 12</p> <p>Tom Huddlestone 21 26</p> <p>Ashley Young 23 10</p> <p>David Nugent 23 14</p> <p><strong>...and five who have not</strong></p> <p>Leighton Baines 23 (age) 16 (caps) </p> <p>Steven Taylor 22 25</p> <p>Nigel Reo-Coker 24 23</p> <p>Matt Derbyshire 22 11</p> <p>James Milner 22 36</p>",
  "<p>On August 22, the American Corn Growers Association endorsed Barack Obama for the presidency. It was only the second time in the group's 21-year history that it has endorsed a candidate for the White House. The corn growers <a href=\"http://www.acga.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=42\">said</a> they like Obama because he supports agriculture and \"the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol\" and other renewable sources.</p> <p>But don't expect to see any prominent mentions of that endorsement on BarackObama.com. Nor should you expect to hear Obama use the word \"ethanol\" between now and election day. Indeed, over the past few months, as the reports on corn ethanol's environmental and food price impacts have gone from bad to awful, Obama has been scurrying away from his record as one of the Senate's most reliable corn ethanol boosters. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, the Obama campaign has refused to answer questions about Obama's support for the federal ethanol mandates, and the candidate's website has been purged of his old energy platform, which included several lines about his plans to increase ethanol production in the US. </p> <p>But try as they might, neither Obama nor his running mate, Joe Biden, can shake the smell of corn alcohol. And that may provide an opening for Obama's opponent, John McCain, who has long been one of the Senate's loudest ethanol critics. McCain briefly switched sides on ethanol in the months prior to the Iowa caucuses. But he is now one of a dozen Republican senators who are pushing <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~hutchison/pr051908a.html\">a bill would freeze the volume of corn ethanol</a> to be blended into gasoline at no more than 9 billion gallons per year.</p> <p>In 2006, Obama, along with four other farm-state senators, sent a letter to President Bush urging him to ignore calls to reduce the $0.54 per-gallon tariff on imports of Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol. During his first year in office, Obama twice used corporate jets belonging to the Illinois-based agribusiness giant, Archer Daniels Midland Co, one of America's biggest ethanol producers. In January 2007, Obama along with two other farm-state senators, Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, and Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, introduced a bill called the American Fuels Act of 2007, which was aimed at promoting ethanol consumption. Touting the bill, <a href=\"http://obama.senate.gov/press/070105-legislation_to_1/\">Obama said</a>: \"To become truly energy independent, we need not only to increase domestic production of renewable fuels like ethanol.\"</p> <p>Like Obama, Biden has long been a staunch ethanol booster. He has supported legislation aimed at requiring oil companies to retrofit their service stations with pumps capable of dispensing E85, a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, and legislation aimed at forcing automakers to produce cars capable of burning E85. Biden has <a href=\"http://biden.senate.gov/issues/issue/?id=0cc59be1-a50d-4e0f-952e-57931f6e4d62\">declared</a> that the US \"should increase the amount of ethanol and biodiesel included in the nation's fuel supply by extending and increasing\" the federal mandates that require American refiners to add ethanol to their gasoline. (Under current federal rules, US oil refiners must be using at least 15bn gallons of ethanol per year in their gasoline by 2015. Nearly all of that will be made from corn.) </p> <p>The huge increases in corn ethanol production are affecting food prices. At least 10 studies have found that US corn ethanol production is affecting prices at the supermarket. An April 8 i<a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Environment/documents/2008/07/10/Biofuels.PDF\">nternal report from the World Bank </a>said that the price surge \"was caused by a confluence of factors but the most important was the large increase in biofuels production in the US and EU.\" In mid-July, Consumer Price Index data showed that over the previous three months, US food prices increased at an annualized rate if 8% - one of the biggest increases in recent history. </p> <p>Clean air advocates contend that the increasing use of ethanol in gasoline is increasing the amount of smog in America's cities. A spate of studies has shown that the production of corn ethanol likely creates more greenhouse gases than conventional gasoline.</p> <p>For Obama, fighting corn ethanol would mean cutting subsidies to corn farmers in his home state. In 2006 alone, according to data from the <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/progdetail.php?fips=00000&amp;yr=2006&amp;progcode=corn&amp;page=states\">Environmental Working Group</a>, Illinois farmers received corn subsidies totalling $752.4m, making Illinois second only to Iowa in total federal corn handouts. And <a href=\"http://www.neo.ne.gov/statshtml/121.htm\">Illinois ranks third</a> among the states in ethanol production capacity, behind only Iowa and Nebraska.</p> <p>Taking \"change\" to Washington - the Obama campaign's mantra - will require fighting agriculture subsidies. But Obama voted for this year's farm bill, a $307bn package stuffed with yet more subsidies. Between 1995 and 2006, federal corn subsidies, which are provided through a myriad of programmes, totalled $56.1bn. That's <a href=\"http://farm.ewg.org/farm/region.php?fips=00000#topprogs\">more than twice the amount</a> given to any other agricultural commodity, including American mainstays like wheat and cotton, and 105 times more than was paid to tobacco farmers.</p> <p>Over the past few months, Obama has repeatedly worked to paint McCain, who favours more domestic drilling for oil and gas, as a handmaiden of Big Oil. That's an interesting charge given that Obama has spent much of his tenure in the Senate carrying water for Big Corn.</p>",
  "<p>Over the past 20 months of campaigning Barack Obama's team has built a reputation for discipline: the inner circle decides on a message, passes it down and everyone sticks to it. But since John McCain announced his running mate last Friday, the Obama team has shown rare uncertainty about how to deal with the Sarah Palin phenomenon.</p> <p>\"They blew it. This was not good,\" a prominent Democrat who preferred to remain anonymous said Thursday, reflecting the mood of many Democrats. He said that the anti-George Bush tide in the country will be enough to see Obama into the White House but the presence of Palin will make it closer.</p> <p>He felt Obama's team and the media had walked into a Republican mousetrap by demonstrating class and gender prejudice against a modern woman from a middle-class background.</p> <p>The initial reaction on Friday from the Obama team was to criticise McCain for picking someone with so little experience but a few hours later there was a more courteous response in a joint statement from Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden, welcoming as historic the Republicans first female vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>Obama's team then joined in the hunt through her background. On top of that, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Biden referred to her as \"good looking\", a comment that many women voters may regard as patronising, before Thursday describing her speech as lacking in substance.</p> <p>The latter is the approach that many Democrats thought the Obama team should have taken from the start, presenting the Republicans as the tired old party, short of ideas, and contrasting this with the Democratic programme.</p> <p>Tad Devine, who was chief strategist for Democratic candidate John Kerry's unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2004, said Thursday: \"I think the best way to respond would be to point out that she said practically nothing about the biggest issue of our time,\" Devine said, listing the economy, the Iraq war and the health service.<br>\"I think they should refrain from anything personal.\"</p> <p>Devine, like other Democrats, feels that the impact of Palin will quickly diminish. \"I think in the end this election will come down to McCain and Obama, as they always do,\" he said.</p> <p>Polls in the past have shown that vice-presidential picks have little influence on the final outcome, even one as controversial as the Republican Dan Quayle in 1988.</p> <p>The focus should shift back to Obama and McCain on the campaign trail and, in particular, the three presidential debates between them later this month and next.</p> <p>Vice-presidents are normally only prominent at three points in a campaign: when chosen, their convention speech and the vice-presidential debate. When Biden comes up against her at the debate, he has to balance a desire to show off his experience of foreign affairs against her limited knowledge against coming across as patronising.</p> <p>The task for the Democrats is to stop her winning over women. If Hillary Clinton had been the vice-presidential pick, that would have helped, but in her absence, they could - if they feel they have to keep it personal - focus on her social conservatism: anti-abortion and creationism.</p> <p>Devine said he thought that it was legitimate for Obama to keep looking at how she was appointed by McCain, with the vetting taking place only the day before, describing this as \"shoddy\" and \"outrageous\" on the part of McCain.</p> <p>He also thought that while Palin's speech would appeal to the Republican base, it might not play well with the independents that McCain needs to win over to secure the White House.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337287754\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1772820787_palin-analysis2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>A day after her prime time television debut, Sarah Palin today was hailed as the single most important unifying force behind the Republican, John McCain.</p> <p>The sheer novelty of Palin -- a self-described hunting, shooting hockey mum who also holds down a day job as a political reformer in the vast state of Alaska -- has provided excitement and glamour to a campaign that had had trouble electrifying the Republican base.</p> <p>Now after the Republicans' rapturous response to Palin's speech on Wednesday night, party activists can claim their own rising young star to counter the Democrats' Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"To have a female vice-presidential nominee for the Republican party is very, very exciting,\" said Ellie Lopez-Bowlan, who heads a Republican women's group in Montrose, Nevada. \"She's refreshing in the fact that she's young, she's a working mother, and she's a true conservative -- I really appreciate that.\"</p> <p>It's unclear how Republicans will react to Palin once the newness wears off, or whether they will forgive her a newcomer's mistakes on the campaign trail. But for the moment she is their rationale for going out to win the election for McCain.</p> <p>Republican enthusiasm for Palin has gone up even further with the questions about her experience, and the steady drip feed of stories about her personal life. Thursday, the campaign issued a furious denial of a National Enquirer story that Palin had had an affair, calling it a \"vicious lie\". \"The smearing of the Palin family must end,\" said a senior adviser, Steve Schmidt.</p> <p>The McCain campaign plans to build on Palin's star role at the convention, deploying her in the white working class small towns around Detroit, Michigan and the conservative bastion of Colorado Springs. Her first stop on Monday will be in Tampa, Florida.</p> <p>Palin pulls in two important demographics behind McCain: at 44 she can connect with younger voters who supported his rivals in the Republican primary. She exercises a strong appeal to working mothers.</p> <p>The Alaska governor has also galvanised two key components of the Republican base that have so far been cool to McCain: fiscal and social conservatives.</p> <p>In her speech on Wednesday night, Palin won wild applause when she talked up her record as a cost-cutting governor who sold off the official plane on eBay, and got rid of the tax-payer funded chef.</p> <p>\"She's something different -- out of the box,\" said Mark Bloch, who heads the Wisconsin chapter of the free market organisation, Americans for Prosperity. \"There was no enthusiasm before -- no real reason to support McCain. There was nothing to fire up the grassroots.\"</p> <p>Palin also struck a chord with social conservatives and Republican women by talking about her love for her pregnant daughter, Bristol, 17, and her son, Trig, 5 months, who was born with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>\"To me I could see immediately how she connects with working families, and women who are raising children but also trying to give something back to the community,\" said Colleen Morrone, a mother of three from Pennsylvania who works for Goodwill. \"I'm definitely more enthusiastic now. It has changed the entire dynamic of the campaign.\"</p> <p>That is of course what the McCain campaign intended. Though Palin breaks the mould of Republican women, her introduction to the faithful this week has been scripted - down to the seating plan on the convention floor.</p> <p>American political conventions are all about firing up the party activists, and sending those enthusiastic troops out onto the election trail.</p> <p>The convention's use of Palin in this regard hewed to that formula, with Republican leaders and operatives using the first two days of the convention to rouse the political troops around the Alaska governor.</p> <p>Before she even stepped on stage at the convention, activists were chanting \"Sarah, Sarah\" and waving made-to-look homemade signs saying \"Palin power\". Convention organisers also moved the women delegates from Florida -- where Palin will appear next week -- right up in front of the stage, and gave them orange scarves to wave.</p> <p>That excitement was precisely what McCain needed as he goes into the elections.</p> <p>After eight disillusioning years of George Bush, the Republican base was demoralised.</p> <p>Fiscal conservatives were angry at the $3 trillion cost of the Iraq war. Evangelicals felt Bush, though a born again Christian, had not done enough to put religion back in the public sphere.</p> <p>Neither group was thrilled with McCain. \"They feel like he has never been in the conservative camp and he sort of flip-flops,\" said Ron Paul, who led a breakaway libertarian movement during the Republican primary. \"I think they don't see him as a firm believer. The conservatives have learned to mistrust him.\"</p> <p>McCain initially was preoccupied with trying to win over independent voters and Democrats who are not behind Obama -- rather than activating the grassroots.</p> <p>He shifted tack last month, using a presidential candidate's forum at a California mega-church to solidify his support among evangelicals by coming out strongly against abortion.</p> <p>Evangelical leaders describe the forum as a turning point in their support for McCain. \"My general impression is that he has been doing increasingly well with evangelicals,\" said Leith Anderson, president of the national association of evangelicals. \"I think that evangelicals have appreciated his overtures and his conversations, and his inclusion of evangelicals in the dialogue.\"</p> <p>Then came Palin, with her uncompromising stand against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, and her support for the teaching of creationism in schools.</p> <p>Palin is certainly the story of the moment -- she is the cover story on a slew of magazines this week. But as November approaches, Republicans are likely to see Palin as a reflection of McCain and his judgment rather than an entirely independent entity.</p> <p>As Robin Moore, a telecom worker and delegate from Wisconsin put it: \"With Palin, John McCain has shown what it takes to be a conservative.\"</p>",

But now that Sarah Palin moves onto a national stage as John McCain's running mate, it might be useful to examine some of her faith-based values in greater detail.</p> <p>She emphasised these views in a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/02/palins-church-may-have-sh_n_123205.html\">talk she gave in June</a> at her hometown church in Wasilla, Alaska. In his introduction, controversial evangelical Pastor Ed Kalnins noted that when he first met Palin, she was the mayor of the town:</p> <blockquote> <p>When I got the chance to meet our mayor, I said: \"This person loves Jesus. That's the bottom line. She loves Jesus with everything she has. She's a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ before she's a mayor.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>After boasting that her 19-year-old son Track had enlisted in the military and was about to be deployed to Iraq, Palin said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Pray for our military men and women who are striving to do what is right. Also, for this country, that our leaders, our national leaders, are sending [US soldiers] out on a task that is from God. \u2026 That's what we have to make sure that we're praying for, that there is a plan and that that plan is God's plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Subsequently, she spoke about a $30bn natural gas pipeline that she's seeking to build from Alaska through Canada to the lower 48 states:</p> <blockquote> <p>I can work really, really hard to get a natural gas pipeline, a $30bn project that's going to create a lot of new jobs for Alaskans and will have a lot of energy flowing through here. And pray about that also. I think God's will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, after listing the tasks she can do as governor to make the state a decent place to live, she added:</p> <blockquote> <p>None of that is gonna do any good if the people's heart isn't right with God. We can work together to make sure that God's will be done here in Alaska.</p> </blockquote> <p>After watching this video, I can perfectly understand why evangelicals are overjoyed with her nomination. But I can't understand why McCain was as well. Did he not think that statements like this might disturb non-evangelicals, not to mention non-Christians, of which, believe it or not, there are a few in this country?</p> <p>Religiously, Sarah Palin is George Bush unbuttoned. The latter manages much of the time to disguise the evangelical passion of his political mission. Palin possesses the same zeal, but lays it on the line for all to see. There is no artifice, no subtlety. It's all right there. If this woman is right for the vice-presidency, then evangelical Christianity is even more pervasive and powerful than I feared.</p> <p>Frankly, candidates like Palin are the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/Jewish_Republicans_try_to_read_Palin_tea_leaves.html\">Jews' worst nightmare</a>. The sentiments she expresses are part of a vestigial memory we internalise about what intolerance and bigotry sounds like. This certainly doesn't rise to the level of flat-out anti-Semitism. But we know when we're not wanted, and as non-believers we're not wanted in the evangelical Christian worldview, except as enablers of Jesus' final coming.</p> <p>The Politico's Ben Smith reports that only two weeks ago, Palin attended her local church to hear Jews for Jesus executive director David Brickner <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13098.html\">excoriate Jews for not accepting Him</a> as their Lord and saviour:</p> <blockquote> <p>Brickner's mission has drawn wide criticism from the organised Jewish community, and the Anti-Defamation League accused them in a report of \"targeting Jews for conversion with subterfuge and deception\".</p> <p>Brickner ... described terrorist attacks on Israelis as God's \"judgment of unbelief\" of Jews who haven't embraced Christianity. </p> <p>\"Judgment is very real and we see it played out on the pages of the newspapers and on the television. It's very real. When [Brickner's son] was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment, some of that conflict, when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment - you can't miss it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm not going to make the same mistake anti-Obamaites made in attributing the Rev Jeremiah Wright's views to Obama by attributing Brickner's views to Palin. But I think it's entirely legitimate to ask what she was doing there while a speaker Jews view as anathema was expressing such ideas. And it's appropriate to insist that she not participate in such forums in the future and that she dissociate herself from the views she heard that day.</p> <p>We are a minority who, in a way, lives on the kindness of strangers, to quote Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. In the evangelical world that Palin embraces there is little kindness for Jews.</p> <p>Until now, McCain enjoyed the highest poll ratings of a Republican presidential candidate in a long time (around 32%). No longer. With Palin on his ticket he can kiss a good deal of that Jewish vote goodbye. Sure, he'll still retain 20-25% of the hardcore true believers. But forget the rest. Smith also writes about an email he received from the Republican Jewish Coalition touting Palin as a friend of Israel because her office has an Israeli flag on the wall:</p> <blockquote> <p>The fact that this tiny image [of the Israeli flag] is the best the official voice of Republican Jewry has to defend Palin is a mark that McCain may have just helped solve Obama's Jewish problem.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Tuesday, MSNBC reported that Palin, chaperoned by Joe Lieberman, had her <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/02/1327325.aspx\">first pro forma meeting with Aipac's national board of directors</a> at her Minneapolis hotel, where the campaign has sequestered her:</p> <blockquote> <p>A campaign official ... said [the meeting] was geared towards putting the American Jewish community at ease over her understanding of US-Middle East relations. </p> <p>\"That's obviously going to be an issue,\" the aide said. \"It's not like being the senator from New York, obviously. But these aren't issues that are off her radar.\" </p> <p>Palin \u2026 expressed her \"heartfelt support for Israel\" and spoke of the threats it faces from Iran and others, the campaign official said. </p> <p>\"We had a good productive discussion on the importance of the US-Israel relationship, and we were pleased that governor Palin expressed her deep, personal, and lifelong commitment to the safety and well-being of Israel,\" Aipac spokesman Josh Block said. \"Like senator McCain, the vice-presidential nominee understands and believes in the special friendship between the two democracies and would work to expand and deepen the strategic partnership in a McCain/Palin administration.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is clearly boilerplate stuff. And you'll notice that the story was fed to the press by spokespeople instead of the candidate herself. This is a further indication of nervousness on the campaign's part in having Palin present her own views on the issue.</p> <p>Clearly, McCain's people worry that Palin has as little understanding of Israel as she has of other major foreign policy issues. It would be legitimate to question whether, at this point, she gets many issues of concern to the Jewish community. Her evangelical background isn't going to help persuade Jews otherwise.</p> <p>This is through no fault of her own. But the fault lies with McCain, who chose Palin without thinking through the impact this would have on his campaign in the Jewish community.</p>",
  "<p>Today, several hundred nuclear industry executives will gather in London for the British-based World Nuclear Association's <a href=\"http://www.wna-symposium.org/prog08.html\">annual symposium</a>.</p> <p>A major session \u2013 The nuclear renaissance: redefining the global framework \u2013 chaired by Keith Parker, chief executive of the UK Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), will be devoted to the new opportunities expected as new nuclear build is back on the energy agenda, \"with a vengeance\", in the words of former prime minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>The session will explore how changes in the law affecting nuclear development has made it much more attractive for private financiers to commit their investment capital.</p> <p>Parker's NIA colleague, Tristram Denton (in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/aug/19/4\">a letter</a> to the Guardian on August 19), was right in stating that \"government has made it clear that the private sector will have to pay the full costs of any new nuclear power generation in the UK,\" but the government is not telling the full story. In two key nuclear expenditure areas, official, if obscure, statements have indicated that subsidies will continue.</p> <p>On the final day of the parliamentary session before recess this year, energy minister Malcolm Wicks told Labour backbencher Paul Flynn MP in <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080722/text/80722w0035.htm#08072397000068\">a written answer</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst the impact of any call on the proposed nuclear indemnity could be very high, there is only an extremely small possibility of the indemnity ever being used, and it is therefore not possible to put a meaningful financial value to the indemnity. The impossibility of quantifying the monetary value of the indemnity is the main reason that there is no commercially available insurance, and the reason an indemnity is needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Flynn had asked what was the financial value of the insurance indemnity against claims deemed to be \"uninsurable\" to be granted to the successful bidder to manage Sellafield. In an earlier answer, Flynn <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080714/text/80714w0016.htm#column_76W\">was told</a> that ministers had:</p> <blockquote> <p>Been informed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) that it expects to have to grant an indemnity against uninsurable claims arising from a nuclear incident that fall outside the protections offered by the Nuclear Installations Act and the Paris/Brussels convention.</p> </blockquote> <p>The issue is complex, but the only conclusion that can be drawn is that a significant taxpayer-funded insurance subsidy is being offered to the nuclear industry.</p> <p>Moreover, in the <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/nuclear/ocns/ocns0708.pdf\">latest annual report (pdf)</a> of the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), quietly released on August 15, it records:</p> <blockquote> <p>The OCNS budget for this reporting period was \u00a32,481k. This total, and a charge for overhead and corporate costs of \u00a3665k, was recovered from the civil nuclear industry and from the DBERR as a charge for OCNS regulatory services.</p> </blockquote> <p>DBERR is the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. This means an unquantified taxpayer subsidy, through DBERR, also went to pay for part of the necessary security arrangements applied to commercial nuclear power.</p> <p>What about elsewhere? Much has been made by the nuclear industry of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/28/nuclear.energy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics\">new reactor, Olkiluoto 3</a>, being built by French construction giant, Bouygues Travaux Publics, some 155 miles north west of Helsinki in Finland (next to two other reactors built in 1978 and 1980) as a model for the nuclear energy renaissance they would like to see develop globally. But the reactor has had serious problems in construction, with concrete and welding problems, as well as a serious fire, with the result that it is already two years behind schedule. This is bad news for the showcase 1,600 MW EPR (European pressurised prototype reactor), which is based on a design concept developed by nuclear giant Areva, a Franco-German consortium formed by Framatome ANP and Siemens. Olkiuoto 3's original budget of \u00a32.5bn has already overrun by an extra \u00a31bn.</p> <p>But who is paying this ever-growing bill? Details released so far suggest that the reactor is being supported by a unique financing package. In January 2006, energy investment analyst Hugo Peek (head of power and utilities at ABN Amro) described its components thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>Syndicated loan of \u20ac1.95bn signed December 2003:<br>\u0095 Bayerische Landesbank (BLB), BNP Paribas, Handelsbanken, JP Morgan and Nordea<br>\u0095 Euribor + 52.5-57.5bps<br>\u0095 Banks received 30bps for \u20ac150m <br>\u0095 In addition to the syndicated loan, bilateral loans worth \u20ac550m were negotiated, \u20ac1.6bn of the original facility refinanced in June 2005<br>\u0095 The deal was said to be oversubscribed, with an increase from the original target amount of \u20ac1.5bn<br>\u0095 MLAs were BayernLB, BTM, BNP Paribas (books), Nordea (books, docs) and SEB (books, facility agent)<br>Tenor is seven years, with pricing currently undisclosed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The BLB is a majority Bavarian state-owned bank, owned by the so-called free state (Freistaat Bayern). This is publicly backed investment, albeit from abroad.</p> <p>But just as in the UK, the Finish government insists the new reactor will be privately financed. \"The government neither builds nor funds the construction of nuclear power. The projects are implemented solely on <a href=\"http://www.finland.si/Public/default.aspx?contentid=130663&amp;nodeid=35025&amp;culture=en-US\">a commercial basis</a>,\" says Riku Huttunen, deputy director general at Finland's ministry of employment and the economy. </p> <p>And at a <a href=\"http://www.paavolipponen.org/cgi-bin/puheet.php?key=343\">global financing summit</a> for new nuclear plants, in Paris in June 2006, Paavo Lipponen, former speaker of the Finnish parliament, who, as prime minister, laid the foundation stone for Olkiluoto 3, said: </p> <blockquote> <p>To finance for the new unit being built in Olkiluoto the owners pay 20% equity capital and grant a loan on equity terms covering another 5%. The remaining 75% has been obtained from international finance markets through a tendering process. TVO received several offers from financial institutions and, thanks to stiff competition, the loan terms are favourable. The Olkiluoto 3 project has not received public aid from the Finnish state, either in the form of guarantees or grants.</p> </blockquote> <p> <br>But what some digging around establishes is that the French export credit agency <a href=\"http://www.coface.com/\">Coface</a>, has provided loans of \u20ac610m in \"export\" credit guarantees for Olkiluoto 3 to TVO, loans which also assist Areva. Additionally, Svensk Exportkredit, the Swedish export credit organisation, has provided 110m Swedish crowns (\u20ac1m). So two foreign states are providing effective publicly financed support. Lauri Myllyvirta of <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/finland/\">Greenpeace Finland</a> has confirmed this week that both Greenpeace and the <a href=\"http://www.eref-europe.org\">European Renewable Energies Federation</a> are appealing to the European court of justice on the European commission ruling that these export credits do not count as state aids. </p> <p>Other investors include power company TVO, whose investors include Fortum and Pohjolan Voima Oy (PVO), Finland's second-biggest energy company, plus forestry and paper giants <a href=\"http://w3.upm-kymmene.com/\">UPM Kymmene</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.storaenso.com/Pages/default.aspx\">Stora Enso</a>. In addition, a host of publicly owned municipal energy companies have invested. </p> <p>The French finance magazine Capital claimed in May that Areva could be obliged to pay \u20ac2.2bn in penalties to Olkiluoto 3's owners, Finnish power generator Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) for delays in the construction of the plant, an assertion swiftly denied by Areva. </p> <p>Back in Britain, in the September edition of <a href=\"http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10336\">Prospect</a>, Tom Burke, formerly executive director at Friends of the Earth, pens a excoriating critique of the optimism of the nuclear sector that an atomic renaissance is within their grasp. He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>The government has pledged that there will be no subsidies for new nuclear construction. But this was never credible, and it is already possible to detect signs of retreat. In 2006 the government bravely promised to 'make sure that the full costs of new nuclear waste are paid by the market'. By 2008 this had mutated into the more nuanced: 'The government will [set] a fixed unit price [for] waste disposal at the time when approvals for the station are given.' This effectively caps the costs of nuclear waste disposal to the operator and transfers the risk of cost overruns on to the taxpayer.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Burke concludes: \"It is hard to argue that this is not a subsidy.\"</p> <p>It is hard to disagree. So nuclear critics, such as CND's Kate Hudson, are correct to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/16/letters\">assert that</a> nuclear subsidies do indeed exist.</p>",
  "<p>If Obama's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/barackobama.democrats20081\">convention speech</a>, with the white columns in the huge stadium was grand opera, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin's was soap opera</a>. The message was not that we should overlook her inexperience, but rejoice in it. We should vote for her because she was a hockey mom. The content of her speech was dumbed down in a way that was exquisitely handcrafted.</p> <p>In the hall, the audience was festooned with folksy placards handcrafted by the same sophisticated but ultimately stupid whiz-kids who put the <a href=\"http://bastardlogic.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/mission-accomplished.jpg\">Mission Accomplished banner</a> on the USS Lincoln five long years ago. The crowd is different, however. At a Republican convention there is always an undercurrent of bitterness and anger, a readiness to boo at the mention of, for example, community organising, or Senate democratic majority leader Harry Reid, or chant \"<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/03/steele-gives-gop-delegates-new-cheer-drill-baby-drill/?mod=googlenews_wsj\">Drill baby, drill</a>\", as the crowd offers to drive their gas-guzzlers over all obstacles.</p> <p>Of course, the crowd had been primed for bitterness by none other than New York's own Napoleon, the bitter and vicious Rudy Giuliani who always gives the impression of payback time for perennial bullying in his schoolboy days. However, any crowd that cheers Giuliani for celebrating McCain's response to Putin's Cossack raid into Georgia, \"We are all Georgians,\" is not up for cerebration. Whose big talking got the Georgians into that predicament? And is McCain in a refugee camp with Russian tanks stopping him from moving about his own country?</p> <p>Technically, Palin's speech was not a patch on Obama's. I ran it past the reading level test on the spell checker. His had come in at a reading level of fourth grade, with no passives. Hers was a reading level of over ninth grade with six per cent of passives. Strangely, although she was clearly intended to evoke the solidarity votes of small town America, her speech writers, Bush's hand-me-downs, were worried about her pronunciation, and spelt out some difficult words for her on the teleprompter: \"habber-dasher\" for haberdasher, \"new-clear\" for nuclear to avert the Bushian \"noocoolear.\"</p> <p>However, even if the style was higher than Obama's, the content was not. It was aimed at people of faith, who could believe in three impossible things before breakfast. Her speechwriter <a href=\"http://www.matthewscully.com/\">Matthew Scully</a> wrote a book about the ethical treatment of animals, which is perhaps why his residual ethics eschewed any mention of shooting wolves from aircraft that may have sullied the hockey mum image. Nor indeed did he mention that her enthusiasm for hockey led her to <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89268486_as_mayor_hard_core_fiscal_conservative_sarah_palin_left_wasilla_20_million_in_debt\">increase the local sales tax</a> \u2013 including on food \u2013 to build an ice-hockey stadium so that her son could indulge his passion closer to home.</p> <p>The speech was almost certainly inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken\">HL Mencken</a>'s thought: \"On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron\". But that is unfair. Both she and her speechwriters are very clever, and unscrupulous, and they want to make her fit that role. They are basing their campaign on the premise that the American electorate wants a president on the edge of Alzheimer's and a vice-president who is auditioning for a part in a schmaltzy soap opera.</p> <p>She mentioned, to cheers that her husband was a proud member of the United Steelworkers Union, she glided over pathological Republican attempts to crush unions, and inhibit their organising efforts. But then, nor did she mention her <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1837918,00.html\">run-in with the town librarian</a> (surely along with the little red school house, an American icon) over censorship, her attempts to promote creationism, her belief that God wants federal funding for Alaskan pipelines, her doubts about global warming, or her pursuit of personal family feuds against public employees. This is a serious omission, and almost perplexing since it could prove that she may indeed be a worthy successor to Dick Cheney as a vice-president, and indeed a better shot, hitting wolves rather than colleagues. But then, Cheney wasn't mentioned either.</p> <p>Her balancing budgets may have been helped by a $1,000 per head per annum pork-barrelling operation from federal funds for her small town, helped by <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/politics/fbi/stevens/story/499537.html\">Senator Ted Stevens</a>, one of the \"good ol' boys\" she was supposed to have cleaned out, but who is currently campaigning for re-election even as he faces Federal corruption charges.</p> <p>She complained that Obama did not mention victory. But if pressed, she might have to explain why diverting troops from the search for Bin Laden in Afghanistan to Iraq and bogging down in both places occasioned mention for victory. Almost as eloquent in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.georgebush\">deafening sound of silence was any reference to President Bush,</a> which is surely churlish. The USA has had eight years of the policies she was prescribing \u2013 and is teetering on the edge of an economic catastrophe, but she just ignored it.</p> <p>Polls suggest that the American public oppose almost every one of Palin's concealed policies. This speech casts the forthcoming telection as an IQ test for the American electorate. If it fails, I foresee long lines outside Canadian and European consulates as the elite (anyone with an IQ over a 100) tries to get out.</p>",

  "<p>It will take some time for the implications of the conflict between Georgia and Russia to be truly understood. Between the unfolding facts on the ground and the flurry of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/russia.georgia\">diplomatic activity</a> in <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/03/europe/EU-EU-Parliament-Georgia.php\">the EU</a> and by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7597336.stm\">the US</a>, there is an impression of developments and change \u2013 but these can only be seen as short term, since the issues at the heart of this situation are far broader than a specific border or state. Indeed, they encompass the very meaning of the international system, and especially the interpretation of international law. Neither an emergency <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL236403420080902\">EU summit</a> nor a visit by US vice-president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/sep/04/georgia.russia\">Dick Cheney</a> to the region will address these, nor will bellicose declarations by Russia. And since the UN is effectively neutralised, due to Russia's refusal to allow a debate on the Georgian conflict, it is unclear when a proper consideration of these core issues can even begin to take place.</p> <p>While any attempt to reduce this debate to simple propositions will do none justice, for the purposes of clarity it is possible to suggest that the western approach holds international law as an absolute arbiter on all issues, both between states and within them. In other words, it is there for state, peoples and individuals alike \u2013 and it tends to attempt to uphold the rights of all three, though in reality it usually comes down firmly on behalf of the state, and so by default sanctifying the integrity of states and international borders, while accepting alterations, such as in the case of Kosovo. Russia, China and other non-democratic regimes see the issue entirely differently. For them international law is solely about the interaction of states: its viability and jurisdiction stops at a state border and national law reigns supreme within any state. The individual, and a people, are therefore beyond the scope of international law within this approach, while territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders are enshrined \u2013 with no exceptions. Within this reading, Kosovo is an unacceptable heresy, to be ruthlessly stamped out.</p> <p>Kosovo keeps coming up because it has become the nub of the Georgian conflict \u2013 which only underlines the need for a far more fundamental debate. And while the west adamantly refutes any comparison between the two, Russia is equally adamant it has served as a precedent for its own actions. Neither side is correct.</p> <p>Within the western perspective, the liberation of Kosovo from Serbia \u2013 starting from a lengthy bombing campaign in 1999, followed by a UN administration of a de facto separate Kosovo, and ending with its self-declared independence \u2013 was a necessity driven by Serbia's systematic abuse of the Albanian majority in Kosovo. As such, it has been defined as a \"unique case\" rather than a precedent in international law, since the circumstances were deemed to be sui generic, not least because the Kosovo issue could be seen as the last unresolved part of the long wars of Yugoslav secession. In truth, this perspective is at best flawed \u2013 there was unfortunately remarkably little that was unique about the circumstances of Kosovo, in which Milosevic let his forces loose upon unprotected civilians: another unchecked despot, whose crimes and misdemeanours were awful but never plumbed the depths of a Mugabe or the Burmese junta, to mention just two of the current cast. What was unique was the guilt of the west over the Yugoslav wars, and especially the Srebrenica massacre \u2013 and the need to assuage it with a large gesture. Moreover, the fact that the west has adamantly refused to act over other despots who decimate their own populations has definitely underlined its belief that Kosovo was unique, and its lack of intention in repeating the move.</p> <p>From the Russian perspective, the 1999 Nato bombing of Kosovo \u2013 and ultimately Serbia \u2013 was unacceptable on two counts: first, it was illegal, since all the action was undertaken without a UN security council resolution. Second, it was a violation of the two issues of international law Russia considers most crucial: absolute acceptance of international borders and territorial integrity; and the inapplicability of international law within a nation state. Within this reading Kosovo was recognised as part of Serbia, and there it had to stay \u2013 while the international community was not at liberty to intervene in the affairs of another state, even if it was persecuting its citizens. To make matters worse, little recognition was given to Russia's crucial role in delivering a halt to the bombing in 1999: working through the OSCE, it was Russia that brought Serbia to the table rather than <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.com/p741721/r_1/US_Kosovo_Frank_Wisner/\">Maarti Ahtisaari</a>, though the west has always given all credit to the latter. And while Russia was party to security council resolution 1244, which gave Kosovo de facto independence under a UN administration, Russia always maintained that it was unacceptable for it to become independent de jure, since this would be a violation of international law. It has therefore refused to recognise an independent Kosovo, and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/67abec7c-6cba-11dd-96dc-0000779fd18c.html\">blocked any attempt</a> to address the matter in the security council over the past <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnN28360832.html\">six months</a>.</p> <p>The Russian invasion of Georgia, and its decision to keep a presence within that state in violation of its signature upon the ceasefire agreement brokered by France, undermines its own argument about respecting territorial integrity and international law. If it had stuck with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are recognised internationally as part of Georgia, it would have been on sticky ground \u2013 but it could still have claimed to have done no more nor less than the west did in Kosovo, including its unilateral recognition of the two regions' independence. It would have been a tenuous proposition, but nonetheless one far more difficult to counter in the west than the one currently maintained by Russia. For by entering Georgia proper, destroying its military infrastructure, and now declaring its democratically elected ruler a \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/world/europe/03russia.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin\">political corpse</a>\" as in one who cannot be dealt with, Russia has basically shown its intentions have little bearing on asserting international law. </p> <p>The west, on the other hand, must stop pretending Kosovo was anything but a dangerous precedent in international law and the viability of the international system. It is. And if it becomes possible to twist out of the current situation due to Russia's excesses \u2013 it will no doubt happen again, somewhere else. Maybe the Kurds, or the Transnistrians, or the Chechens \u2013 the world is full of peoples who want to shake off unacceptable rule and become independent states. Ironically, Georgia, much like many other former Soviet states, was deeply worried about the precedent of Kosovo before it took place, fearing the South Ossetians and the Abkhazians would use it to break away and declare independence \u2013 a move that would have been difficult to counter in the international community. In the event, by Russia taking the step \u2013 or rather several steps too far \u2013 the two regions have lost the opportunity.</p>",

Bouncing around the stage in red tights in a goth black skirt, Allen turns Paul's platform into pop-rock couplets. \"We don't want world government,\" she sings, \"or the Bilderberg Group that pays for it.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the parallel universe of Paulistan.

Kevin Barrett, a Wisconsin professor who's running for Congress on the promise to re-investigate the 9/11 attacks, gets a press badge and asks Paul if he supports the cause. \"He says maybe one day we'll find out exactly what happened!\" Barrett exults, grinning ear-to-ear. \"I got my soundbite!\"</p> <p>When Paul's campaign kicked off in early 2007, his role in the wide-open Republican race looked like a simple one. He would talk about small government and the botched Iraq war. He would talk about his record of opposing government surveillance programmes, tax hikes and the department of education. He would lose. </p> <p>That's exactly what happened. But along the way to this convention, the 72-year-old Paul, <a href=\"http://libertarianhistory.blogspot.com/2007/05/ron-paul-campaign-1988.html\">who in 1988 was the Libertarian party's presidential candidate</a>, turned into a surprising cult figure. His diehard supporters - some fraction of the 1.2 million votes he got across the Republican primaries this year - tell people to research his work and ideas as the way to solve America's problems. \"Google Ron Paul,\" reads one T-shirt in the halls. Another T-shirt, a few steps away: \"Have you Googled Ron Paul yet?\"</p> <p>This is ironic. As Paul has become a cult figure, he's exerted less influence on the Republican party he wants to change. The party's platform was written with no virtually input from Paul's energetic activists. Late in the night, a rumour goes through the Target Centre that the GOP will nominate John McCain without Paul's small number of delegates in the building - a signal of how little regard they have for the leadership of Paul's party, and vice-versa.</p> <p>If the GOP isn't worried, it's because Paul has become the latest iconic leader of the political fringe, filling the role played by Ralph Nader in 2004 and 2000, by Ross Perot in the 1990s and by the forgotten John Anderson in 1980. Everybody wants a piece of him, more for his name recognition and fundraising ability than for what he believes. The Independent Greens of Virginia - a key swing state - <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2008/08/17/2008-08-17_mayor_bloomberg_on_virginia_ballot_as_ca.html\">circulated petitions to put Paul on the ballot</a> as the running mate of its presidential candidate, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Neither man has accepted or rejected the ballot line, and a Paul spokesman laughed when I asked what his man had in common with the famously nanny-ish mayor.</p> <p>Paul's people are having fun in the Twin Cities, but it's hard to say what they're achieving. Maybe a Sunday afternoon political training session (which sold out quickly) will give them some organisation. Maybe the multiple candidates for Congress who walked the Target Centre, inspired to run by Paul, will hone his message. But <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8063611/\">Tucker Carlson</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=83665295-1de6-4571-af9c-0a90f6d1fde0\">unabashed Paul fan</a> and NBC News commentator who emcees the Rally for the Republic, thinks the idea that Paul's campaign marked a \"libertarian moment\" is bunk.</p> <p>\"Absolutely not,\" says Carlson. \"It's human nature. People want to control what other people are doing.\" </p> <p>Carlson's relatively optimistic about the movement. It's an \"anti-cult of personality\". As fringy as it gets, it contains more sound ideas than, say, a Mitt Romney speech. But Carlson doesn't stay the whole night. He skedaddles after former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura growls out a speech that calls for, yes, <a href=\"http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/stories/2008/09/02/ron_paul_convention.html\">a new investigation into 9/11</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The former Scottish Labour leader Wendy Alexander has survived a bid to have her suspended from Holyrood for a day for illegally failing to declare nearly \u00a310,000 in campaign donations.</p> <p>MSPs voted by 70 to 49 to reject a formal recommendation by Holyrood's standards committee to suspend her from parliament for just one sitting after a heated parliamentary debate about the committee's alleged bias earlier today.</p> <p>The vote tonight is a bittersweet victory for Alexander, who unexpectedly resigned as Scottish Labour leader in late June after the committee's ruling, forcing the party to hold its second leadership contest in a year. </p> <p>The sister of the international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, she had consistently denied any deliberate wrongdoing in failing to register nine donations to her leadership campaign last year. </p> <p>She insisted she had acted on advice from parliamentary officials, and later updated her donations register. </p> <p>But many observers believed she resigned in part because it later emerged there were further questions about her original account over how the donations had been handled. </p> <p>The standards committee had recommended the sanction after she was censured by the Scottish parliamentary standards commissioner, Jim Dyer, for breaching the rules on declaring all donations within 30 days. </p> <p>On the last day before the summer recess in June, a narrow majority of MSPs on the standards committee voted to suspend her, by four votes from the SNP and Liberal Democrat members to three votes from Labour and Tory members. </p> <p>MSPs again split chiefly down party lines this evening, with all SNP and several Liberal Democrats voting for her suspension, while all Labour and Tory MSPs voting against, with most Lib Dems voting alongside them. </p> <p>Two SNP MSPs abstained while one MSP who notably failed to vote or abstain formally was former Labour leader Jack McConnell, who has never been an admirer of Alexander.</p> <p>Speaking after the vote, Alexander told BBC Scotland she welcomed the decision. \"I said in June that my pursuers had sought political victory with little thought to the standing of the parliament and that I'd hope wiser heads would prevail.</p> <p>\"They have done so today. Today is a victory for the law, for natural justice and for common sense and I welcome that.\"</p> <p>Reflecting opposition parties' allegations that the standards committee had been politically-biased, the Scottish Tory leader, Annabel Goldie, said the vote called the committee's conduct into question and called for a review of its powers by the parliament. </p> <p>\"What is imperative is that the way in which the committee conducts itself is self-evident of the highest standards of probity and objectivity,\" she said.</p>",

And she is black, one of a tiny number of African Americans at the Republican national convention being held in St Paul this week.</p> <p>A glance around the Republican national convention this week shows a sea of white faces. Only 36 of its delegates are black, less than 2% of the total. At the Democratic convention in Denver last week, 1,087 delegates were black, about a quarter of the total.</p> <p>The Republican party has no African Americans in the US House of Representatives and Senate, while the Democratic party has one African-American US senator -- Barack Obama -- and 42 in the House. The Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies, a research group that studies African-American politics, has identified seven black Republican nominees for federal office this year -- out of more than 460 races -- and said none are likely to win.</p> <p>While the Democratic party last week made history in nominating the first ever black candidate of a major party for president, the Republican party, which in the 19th century freed the slaves and passed measures aimed at welcoming them into American society, remains bereft.</p> <p>Honeycutt, a physician, is running for congress in an overwhelmingly African American district in Georgia. But in her campaign material she hides her party affiliation.</p> <p>\"I don't want to turn them off by saying I'm a Republican right up front,\" she said in an interview in the convention hall. \"I see blacks voting Democrat because their mother did, their father did, their friend says to vote Democrat. And they're not taking the time to do due diligence and see what does the Democrat party stand for, what does the Republican party stand for.\"</p> <p>Indeed, surveys show African Americans tend to be culturally conservative and churchgoing, favour state aid to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools, and are sceptical of the social security programme, a signature issue of the Democrats.</p> <p>In the face of polls showing African Americans vote, Honey and other black Republicans say that the group is a natural constituency for their party.</p> <p>\"Black folks need to know what the policies are, what the planks in the Republican platform are,\" Honeycutt said. \"They need to see that that is exactly how they live, the conservative lives that they live.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans point to the early history of the party. It was founded on opposition to slavery, and President Abraham Lincoln, who led the north to victory in the civil war that ended slavery, was a Republican. The Republican party also led the fight for a series of constitutional amendments granting citizenship to those slaves, while Democrats in the mid 19th century tended to represent racist Southern interests. Martin Luther King was at one point a Republican, and President George Bush appointed two black secretaries of state.</p> <p>But in the last sixty years, the Democrats largely usurped the Republicans as the party of civil rights. In 1948, Democratic president Harry Truman desegregated the US military, and in the 1960s Democrat Lyndon Johnson shepherded through landmark civil rights legislation even as he acknowledged it would cost him support among southern whites. Arican Americans attracted by Johnson's civil rights record then rose within the party and organised the black community for the Democrats.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidates, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, made appeals to southern whites that were deemed racially tinged. Culturally, the Republican party since the 1960's has seen its base move toward the Southeastern United States, home to the old slave states and to segregation, and the western states where few African Americans live.</p> <p>\"The south becomes Republican, giving blacks all the more reason to become Democrat,\" said Don Rose, a veteran of the civil rights era and press spokesman for Martin Luther King's Chicago campaign.</p> <p>In the 21st century, the lingering Republican deficit among African Americans is clear: In 2004, Bush won 11 percent of the black vote, a figure roughly on par with every election since 1964.</p> <p>John McCain has this year made explicit appeals to black political groups, but his home state of Arizona has a tiny black population.</p> <p>\"In addition, Senator McCain does not comfortably weave expressions of faith and religious beliefs into his campaign's narrative - something that many African Americans can relate to, even if they do not support the candidate,\" writes David Bositis of the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies.</p> <p>\"Minorities believe that the GOP is unwelcoming,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia. \"Blacks see the Republican party as the home of almost all those who today oppose or want to slow civil rights enforcement.\"</p> <p>Black Republicans acknowledge they need to improve their outreach without pandering to blacks or adjusting their policies in a way that would drive away white members of their base.</p> <p>To that end, the National Black Republicans Association has posted billboards across the country reminding Americans that Martin Luther King was a Republican. Richard St Paul, a black Republican city councilman in New Rochelle, New York, said the party should recruit more black candidates.</p> <p>And he is unapologetic about his opposition to Obama, who would be the first black president.</p> <p>\"It's fantastic that Obama has reached that plateau,\" St Paul said. \"Nothing says that I have to support a person just because we're the same colour. Martin Luther King said it's not about the colour of the skin but about the content of the character.\"</p> <p>Rufus Montgomery, an African-American Georgia delegate to the national convention, is sceptical the party should change much at all, noting that Republicans have won the White House in seven out of the last 10 elections without substantial support from blacks.</p> <p>He resorted to a metaphor from American football: \"When you're up 42 to 6 at the half, you don't change your strategy.</p> <p>\"The principles and policies of the Republican party: when that appeals to someone they are welcome to join us.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Yang Jia burst into a police station in Shanghai and stabbed six officers to death, the penalty was predictable. He was given the death sentence.</p> <p>But few would have expected the public reaction to his case, which has been of widespread sympathy and has sparked debate about the police's treatment of suspects in what has become a Chinese cause celebre.</p> <p>Now a prominent intellectual has asked the supreme court to intervene and order a public retrial. The artist Ai Weiwei, who designed the Olympic Bird's Nest stadium, has written that the case's impact is so great that an open hearing is needed to demonstrate the country's commitment to judicial reform.</p> <p>A closed court in Shanghai found Yang guilty of premeditated murder earlier this week. According to the official media, the unemployed 28-year-old from Beijing attacked the station on July 1. He threw Molotov cocktails at the building and injured the security guard before bursting inside where he slashed at officers, killing six and wounding four more.</p> <p>But his case caught the public imagination following claims that he was seeking revenge for earlier mistreatment by officers. Thousands of messages supporting Yang - many removed by censors - appeared on blogs and bulletin boards. Some have even described him as a hero, though more have suggested his case raises alarming questions about the police treatment of suspects and the judicial process.</p> <p>Police said at a press conference that Yang, from Beijing, was angry because officers at the station in Zhabei district detained him last year for allegedly stealing a bicycle that he had in fact rented. He later demanded around 10,000 yuan (\u00a3800) in compensation for \"mental anguish\".</p> <p>The Guangdong-based Southern Weekend newspaper reported that Yang had claimed he was beaten during the interrogation, although the police denied it.</p> <p>The supreme people's court now reviews all death sentences under \"kill fewer, kill carefully\" reforms introduced two years ago.</p> <p>But in his letter, Ai argued that a full retrial is needed, arguing the original investigation and hearing had been handled improperly. \"Since this case has generated enormous social impact, it should not be ignored ... To go through a public and transparent judicial procedures is to safeguard the constitution as well as test China's determination and power of its judicial reform.\"</p> <p>Yang's relatives now fear that he may lose his chance to appeal. Xiong Liesuo, a Beijing lawyer hired by Yang's father, told the Guardian that the court refused him access to the defendant, saying Yang had already accepted a lawyer arranged by his mother. The couple divorced some years ago.</p> <p>But Yang's mother has been uncontactable since she was questioned by Beijing police following the Shanghai attack. Prior to her disappearance she apparently signed a document authorising another lawyer, Xie Youming, to act for her son. He has not replied to Xiong's messages and could not be contacted.</p> <p>\"According to Chinese law we need to confirm the appeal with [Yang] himself, but when we went to the police station they gave us a lot of reasons to stop us meeting him,\" Xiong said.</p> <p>\"[Another] reason they gave is that we don't have the judgement, which the court told us was already given to Yang Jia's mother. But we all know his mother has been out of contact for a while and when we asked how to contact his mother the court did not answer.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>THE AMAZING FIVER NEWS VACUUM - EVERYONE'S GETTING IN ON OUR ACT!</strong></p> <p>As we all know by now, football was finally broken beyond repair on Monday, as Dr Sulaiman Al Bramovich and his big-money Dubai pals purchased Manchester City. Since then, possibly thinking \"well sod this, what is the effing point, the Premier League has finally turned into the complete farce it has always threatened to become, I'm now going to walk in a straight line to the nearest shore, take all my clothes off on the beach, then march into the sea, Reggie Perrin-style, until the waves cover my head and everything goes calm and quiet, and then very calm and very quiet, and then my lungs explode, elegantly unfolding out into net form as I slowly drift down towards the bed\", people have started leaving the game in droves. Alan Curbishley departed from West Ham United, while Mike Ashley has started to dismantle Newcastle United, brick by brick, until there is nothing left standing.</p> <p>This mass exodus of one person, and possibly another in Kevin Keegan, maybe, perhaps, leaves the Fiver in a tricky position. What exactly is going on at these two crisis clubs? Nobody seems to know! In fact, there is so much confusion that even the masters of hot air, flannel, bull, pish, tish and mummery, Sky Sports News, can't be bothered to wing it. They're claiming that West Ham are considering a shortlist of \"30 potential candidates\" to succeed Curbishley, which is as close as they'll ever get to admitting they haven't an effing clue about anything. Especially as hot favourite Slaven Bilic has distanced himself by saying he will honour his contract to hammer England twice in World Cup qualifying with Croatia. Stuart Pearce has also ruled himself out of the running, as if he was ever in it, though rumours persist about everyone's favourite funny goose-stepping moron, Paolo Di Canio. Not a clue, anybody.</p> <p>Meanwhile Sky's man stationed all day outside the St James' Park bar - it looks like it's called Shearer's, but the reception on our telly's not great, they can't have given it a title as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as Shearer's, surely - has totally given up the ghost and started to cry for mammy want cuddle. Oh all right, he's reported that Ashley will only have to pay Keegan \u00a32m if he's sacked, and not the \u00a38m previously mooted. Which sounds like an imminent sacking followed by an interminable contractual wrangle to us, but then we're just simple folk.</p> <p>Keegan is prepared to stay at Toon, it's said, but only if (a) he is given control over the club's transfer budget, (b) Dennis Wise is chased away from Newcastle by a man wielding a pointed stick, (c) Wise is caught by the man wielding a pointed stick, and (d) the man with the pointed stick shoves the pointed stick into one of Wise's buttocks, causing Wise to shout \"yaroo!\" and never come back up north ever again. However this is unlikely as (a) Ashley quite likes Wise, (b) Ashley is rumoured to be the only man in Newcastle who owns a pointed stick, and (c) the last time Keegan was let loose with a budget, he spent \u00a350m in 15 months at Manchester City on players like Jon Macken, Michael Tarnat, Trevor Sinclair, Vincente Mattias Vuoso, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler, Roger Hunt and Ian St John.

  "<p>Counter-terrorism detectives and MI5 have long been aware of the intricate web of connections between many of the groups and individuals involved in supporting and carrying out jihadist terror attacks in Britain. The Guardian has mapped out some of those relationships that give shape to al-Qaida in the UK.</p> <p>Most of the men who feature within the network are young - some barely out of their teens - and most are British of Pakistani origin. A handful immigrated to Britain from various parts of Africa, while three were born in the Caribbean and one is of Turkish Cypriot origin.</p> <p>What links them is not only faith and ideology, but close family bonds, friendships made at further education colleges and places of work, and personal ties forged at training camps, both in the lawless tribal areas of north-west Pakistan, and in the national parks of England.</p> <p>The five men convicted in 2007 of plotting to bomb the Ministry of Sound nightclub in central London, for example, were said in court to be associates of Zeeshan Siddiqui, who went on the run in October 2006 after being subjected to a control order. Although never convicted of any offence, the Old Bailey heard that Siddiqui trained with a number of the Ministry of Sound plotters at a terrorism training camp in Pakistan, and even considered volunteering for a suicide bomb attack. </p> <p>Growing up in Hounslow, west London, Siddiqui was a close friend of Asif Hanif, who attempted to kill himself in a suicide bomb attack on a bar in Tel Aviv. </p> <p>Another of the Ministry of Sound gang is a brother of two other men who went on the run after being subjected to control orders. Yet another worked at the same taxi firm in Luton as a shadowy figure nicknamed Q, who has been identified in court as being instrumental in arranging for Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the July 7 2005 bombers, to travel to Pakistan, where he attended a terrorism training camp.</p> <p>Khan returned to Pakistan the following year, and is known to have attended another camp at the same time that Muktar Said Ibrahim, the leader of the July 21 bombers, was undergoing terrorism training in Pakistan. Both men returned to the UK at around the same time, armed with bomb-making expertise that allowed them to construct almost-identical devices. Ibrahim and members of his group had previously undergone some form of training in the Lake District, northern England, alongside several men who were later convicted of training for jihad in the New Forest on England's south coast.</p> <p>The influence of two other figures, Abu Hamza and Omar Bakri Mohammed, can be seen in the backgrounds of many of these men. Many listened to Hamza's sermons at Finsbury Park mosque in north London, while many passed through al-Muhajiroun, the now outlawed organisation that Bakri formed in London in 1996.</p> <p>Last year, Peter Clarke, then the head of Scotland Yard's Counter-Terrorism Command, said: \"We are seeing networks within networks, connections within connections, and links between individuals that cross local, national and international boundaries.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last night in St Paul, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin1\">Sarah Palin drew a picture</a> of 1950s America that didn't exist in the 1950s. She talked about the America she knows - the families she grew up with, the voters she saw every day on the street, every Sunday in church, every week at the PTA - it was a rosy, white-picket fence Pleasantville version of America. And while this image wasn't pure invention, it shares little with the full complexity of American reality - the challenges we faced then, and now, as well as the opportunity born of that complexity.</p> <p>There have always been plenty of Americans who don't share Palin's small-town world or worldview. Even in the 1950s there were new immigrants, refugees from the European and Asian wars who made other, older, whiter Americans uncomfortable. Then there were those Americans who questioned the status quo and were thus questioned for their patriotism, whose lives were ruined for thinking the American dream allowed for a broad interpretation of support for the constitution, for the flag, for the means of living as an American.</p> <p>Palin may have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/04/sarahpalin.uselections2008\">won over</a> some of the naysayers last night with her poise and her charm and her screw-your-courage-to-the-sticking-place resolve around her family's troubles (namely her youngest son and oldest daughter). She's got a sweet face and an <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042200/\">Annie Get Your Gun</a> frontier-gal mentality that appeals to a certain slice of Americana that's undeniably, well, American.</p> <p>Yet if the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull may be lipstick, the difference between all American mothers is simply which shade. That is to say, women and men in America are all fiercely protective of their families, their livelihoods, their loved ones and their country. And while Palin's speech may have won her another few rounds as a proxy, or at least an attack dog, for this strangely conceived new Republican partnership, it was tone deaf to one of the key tropes that has energised Obama's cross-party supporters.</p> <p>That is that the majority of Americans, outside of the diehards in St Paul, perhaps, are sick of being divided. The majority of the country would rather think that union is possible, rather than further entrenchment in the culture wars that have so scarred this country. It's why <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/2008/01/03/remarks_of_senator_barack_obam_39.php\">Barack Obama's variations on the theme he espoused in Iowa</a> (and back in 2004) - \"We are not a collection of red states and blue states - we are the United States of America\" \u2013 has had such resonance. </p> <p>To the contrary, Sarah Palin's speechwriters, and by extension Sarah Palin herself, were intent on not only cementing a red America versus a blue America, but rather pushing the idea that there is only one true America. And that America is very, very red. New red. As in anti-commie red. Anti-gay red. Anti-liberal red. And anyone who, say, was born to immigrant parents, who isn't lily white, who has perhaps moved around America instead of growing up in a small town, isn't really American.</p> <p>I'd venture to say that when <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/04/us/politics/04repubday.html?hp\">the loving around Palin's speech</a> stops, and the starry-eyed stop feeling pleased with her real American cadences, a lot of the Americans that are counted out of her narrow definition of just exactly who is a true American will look around and realise they're out of that box, and her shine will dull. </p> <p>With this Republican couple, pity the citizen who questions the sanctity of fighting for the country - whether that battle is an appropriate battle or not and whether the means of fighting that battle are appropriate. \"Al-Qaida terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America \u2026 he's worried that someone won't read them their rights?\" Palin said, echoing the kind of Bush/Cheney politics of terror we've been subject to over the last eight years, mocking the truly American concerns for the fabric of our democracy. </p> <p>Part of this is about a certain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.religion\">relationship with the Christian right</a>. But Palin smartly didn't make much reference to her aggressively religious position on abortion (against in every case, as delegates are cheerfully referencing in regards to her own forthcoming grandchild), gay marriage and even evolution (pushing intelligent design). Indeed the only nod to the social conservative base she has energised was her reference to her \"servant's heart\". She didn't need to go there. Having her whole family on hand provided that evidence.</p> <p>Instead she talked about her army-bound son (deploying to Iraq, it was emphasised, on September 11), and her small-town roots. All of which were meant to outline real Americans - from the heartland, not the liberal coasts; from the small towns, not the cities. In other words, longtime Americans with deep roots and not recent immigrants, Americans who never have cause to doubt the American dream.</p> <p>She even referenced Harry Truman, even though their small-town roots would be their only political commonality. \"Long ago, a young farmer and habber-dasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice-presidency. A writer observed: 'We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity and dignity.' I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman,\" Palin said, drawing a line between herself and the 33rd president.</p> <blockquote> <p>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories, and fight our wars. They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better. When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Sarah Palin in St Paul last night seems like a woman who would be quite comfortable in Red Scare America, just as much as Red State America, but its not clear that she's comfortable in today's America.</p>",
  "<p>There has been a fall in the number of women getting top jobs. Why didn't that surprise me much? I've been waiting for the point at which the tide began to turn; I spent two years poring over the statistics about employment for my book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Willing-Slaves-Overwork-Culture-Ruling/dp/000716372X\">Willing Slaves: How the overwork culture rules our lives</a>. I trawled through the huge volumes of research produced every year on every aspect of the UK labour market, and the patterns began to become clear. </p> <p>What is at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/04/equality.humanrights\">today's</a> depressing <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/projects/workingbetter/sexandpower/pages/variationsitedefault.aspx\">assessment</a> by the Equality and Human Rights Commission is the phenomenon of work intensification. Or put it another way, work has got a lot, lot harder. The pace of most offices has quickened, the demands on most public servants has immeasurably increased. The competitiveness of the private sector requires its senior staff to be informed across a wide range of fast-changing information.</p> <p>Talk to any senior executive and they will tell the same story: 9am-7pm are standard working hours and often you need to go back to work either on the BlackBerry or the computer in the evening and certainly squeeze in a few hours at the weekend. Add in commuting time, and work at senior levels makes enormous inroads into your private life: children can only ever be a breakfast hobby, a 10-minute bedtime cuddle. Weekends are the precious catch-up time.</p> <p>It doesn't surprise me at all that many, many women who have the talent and skill to get all the way to the top come to a point in their 30s and 40s when they decide that they just don't want to do that. They'll settle for a compromise of a less demanding job. They'll opt for the mummy track. And what has happened over the last decade is that a combination of enlightened government legislation and public relations pressure on organisations is that that mummy track is now available. In most workplaces, it is possible to work part-time. That is a great step forward \u2013 and don't allow the naysayers to argue that increased maternity rights are the problem, crippling women's chances of promotion. The one big secret of the mummy track is that you mustn't make the mistake of thinking that you part-timers will get the top jobs.</p> <p>So what is now emerging is stark evidence of the twin track. You have larger numbers of women in the labour market than ever, but the majority wants work that can fit around their family responsibilities. Surely as a society, that is a choice we should be applauding, not lamenting? Women continue to make massive emotional and time investments in their children: thank God. What is depressing is that women are still having to choose between ambition and their family welfare \u2013 and this is not just putting the children first, it may also be about putting the marriage first. I know one couple in banking, both in senior positions: the husband told the wife she had to cut back her career to facilitate his. Or he would leave her.</p> <p>Let's be honest: the work culture of most organisations rewards availability over talent. Only a few workplaces want the brilliant genius who is around for three or four days; most bosses want something much more modest: constantly accessible and reliable.</p> <p>Once, I would have argued that the bosses are the villains of the piece. Their prejudice, their lack of interest in promoting women and the organisational cultures that that produces. There is still plenty of that around I agree, but many organisations are coping with hugely complex challenges; bosses need totally available senior staff \u2013 employees who think nothing of working late into the evening on a sales bid, who are happy to jump on a plane to the US to close a contract at a few hours' notice. Or who will spend an entire four-day weekend away with the kids 24/7 on a BlackBerry as I witnessed recently with a corporate lawyer friend. </p> <p>Or another friend, also a lawyer, who had to pull out of the family vacation at the last minute \u2013 despite having just spent two months on the other side of the world from his adored family. The tougher the jobs get for men, the more the fallout hits their wives: these are the kinds of careers which absolutely require a stay-at-home mother to pick up the pieces or the children end up drifting about in a limbo land of nightmare logistics, childcarers, housekeepers and nannies.</p> <p>When we imagined a brave new world of equality in the workplace, we miscalculated on how the world of work was going to speed up, and become much more competitive and insecure. There's no point berating men for not doing more to help with the childcare \u2013 they are often struggling to keep their jobs and exhausted and hollow-eyed; they are all too well aware of how much they are missing out on. We have a work culture that makes slaves of far too many of us \u2013 and many talented women are refusing to buy into all of it. It is women's compromised ambitions that protect their families and children from an invasive, demanding work culture that pays mere lip service to such vital social infrastructure.</p>",
  "<p>The EU is trying to clarify citizens' rights to healthcare outside their own country but a draft directive raises a host of questions about payment and reciprocal responsibilities. </p> <p>The directive would move the EU on from today's health agreement, which provides automatic reimbursement for emergency treatment for EU citizens wherever they may be. Until 2006, travellers had to take the E111 form with them to qualify for emergency care. It's estimated that 1% of the EU's total healthcare costs are incurred by people being treated outside their home country: that's about \u00a38bn, and much of it is explained by movements across particular borders, between Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium and between Germany and Austria.</p> <p>In future, the EU envisages a union-wide health economy in which would-be patients could travel to seek care in the knowledge their home healthcare system would cover (some of the) costs. </p> <p>The proposals are an attempt to clarify patients' rights following European Court of Justice rulings. In a landmark case in 2006, Yvonne Watts successfully argued that Bedfordshire primary care trust should cover the \u00a34,000 cost of a hip replacement operation she had sought in France, because otherwise she would have faced \"undue delays\".</p> <p><strong>Payments</strong></p> <p>The directive would entitle patients to receive non-urgent healthcare in any of the 27 EU countries and be reimbursed up to the amount their care would have cost to provide at home. So for UK patients, if treatment was no more expensive than it would have been under the NHS, they could reclaim the full cost of healthcare received in other EU member states, although they would normally have to pay for their own travel and subsistence. </p> <p>Treatments unavailable at home will not be reimbursed. So if the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has not approved certain drugs, patients would have to meet the full cost if they received them abroad. Similarly, spa treatments and massages available in some countries' health systems would also not be covered.</p> <p>Patients will still need to get a hospital referral from their GP first. Afterwards, they would be free to seek outpatient treatment abroad without any need for authorisation. But for care involving an overnight stay, they may need permission to have treatment abroad. If the numbers of patients going abroad would \"seriously undermine\" the stability and smooth running of services, member states could insist patients obtain prior authorisation to receive healthcare in another country. </p> <p>This would require clear evidence that preventing treatment abroad would damage national health systems and authorisation could not be refused if patients would face excessive delays.</p> <p>Major problems lie ahead, especially over the calculation of costs. States with social insurance systems such as Germany and France will find it relatively easy to calculate reimbursements. Others would have to establish tariffs and systems to calculate what citizens are entitled to claim back. In the NHS, indicative prices exist for some procedures (at least in England) but not for others. \"What would be the level of reimbursement for care,\" asks Anna Dixon, director of policy at the King's Fund, citing non-hospital treatment for which there are no tariffs; block contracts are the norm, so it is much harder to calculate a price per item. </p> <p>It's not just the NHS which lacks the database the directive would require. Spanish health is financed through local taxation and central government funding. Delivery is devolved to the 17 regions. Denmark finances healthcare through taxation set at 8% of income. The bulk of this is then distributed to five regions, with the rest going to 98 municipalities. </p> <p>Costs vary as they do in different parts of the UK. An implication of the EU move is that Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland would have to calculate how much patients should be reimbursed. Scotland has tariffs for some elective procedures, while Wales and Northern Ireland have none. </p> <p>The growing prevalence of day patients who are admitted to hospital for minor surgery but do not stay overnight will also be problematic. The directive also only distinguishes between in- and outpatient care, so it is not clear whether day patients would need authorisation to go abroad or not. </p> <p><strong>Discrimination</strong></p> <p>The directive could lead to allegations of discrimination. Why should NICE rulings be applied to patients from England if a non-approved therapy is available in, say, France? If patients have to pay upfront for their care in a Belgian hospital, this could mean that only those who have the money would be able to go abroad for treatment. Health systems would have to establish mechanisms to pay each other directly; with many countries operating devolved health services, the complications are endless.</p> <p>The EU seems to want to establish free choice for patients - a political proposition that is highly contentious in some countries. The directive proposes that patients receiving care abroad could have more expensive care and pay the difference themselves. That trespasses on a hot political debate in England about top-ups. </p> <p>As things stand private patients must pay the full amount for care. But if the directive allows them to receive rather more or better quality healthcare abroad and be reimbursed for what they would have received in the NHS, it will become increasingly difficult to argue that the same principle should not apply at home.</p> <p>The clinical professions are accredited differently in the various countries; there are different minimum standards of care. What happens if a patient's treatment abroad goes wrong? </p> <p>Perhaps anxieties are overblown. If the directive becomes law, it may have few takers. According to the website treatmentabroad.com, last year only 28,000 people from the UK received elective surgery and other non-urgent hospital treatment abroad. As each patient typically spent over \u00a33,000, it would have cost nearly \u00a397m to reimburse them. </p> <p>Health collaboration is strong in certain areas. Strasbourg has arrangements with Li\u00e8ge and Luxembourg to exchange trainees, teaching, research and patients; Maastricht, Aachen and German speaking Belgium also treat each other's patients, as do hospitals either side of the Italian/Slovenian border. Keith Pollard, director at Treatment Abroad, says some medical tourism is also common to countries where care is cheaper, such as from Germany and Austria to Hungary.</p> <p>A recent study by McKinsey argues that globally, 40% of those travelling abroad for healthcare do so to get access to the latest treatments and technologies. A third seek better quality care than they would find at home (particularly those from developing countries) while many simply want quicker access to orthopaedics, general surgery or cardiology.</p> <p>Treatment Abroad says for UK patients, anxiety about MRSA is an important factor behind the decision to go abroad, alongside waiting lists and the cost of private healthcare in the UK. In countries with long waiting lists such as Northern Ireland, Wales and Spain, the directive could in theory help to cut them. </p> <p>There may be financial benefits for lower-cost health regimes. \"If you go to a country that is cheaper, the NHS will be quids in because it reimburses at that rate,\" says John Bowis, one of London's representatives in the European Parliament. Hungary is already popular among patients from northern Europe for dentistry.</p> <p>The directive might strengthen private insurers such as Bupa and PPP. They already operate internationally, so would be in position to advise local health systems about healthcare in other EU states. And they may also move into providing \"navigation\" services, helping patients and GPs choose where to go for foreign care.</p> <p>Pollard estimates that around half those who have gone abroad for treatment used an agent and half went under their own steam. \"The market is very fragmented,\" he says. \"There are a lot of one- to three-man bands acting as go-betweens.\" The directive would create opportunities for bigger players to set up medical tourism intermediary services, be they travel operators such as Thomson or insurance giants.</p>",
  "<p>In a fresh effort to defuse the political crisis, Thailand's cabinet agreed today to a hold a referendum hours after the country's beleaguered prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, again vowed he would not resign in a national radio address.</p> <p>No date was set for the referendum but it could be held within 30 days of the Senate passing an enabling law. A cabinet minister said it would ask a range of questions on whether the government should step down or dissolve parliament.</p> <p>But in a rambling 50-minute address to the nation Samak dashed expectations that he would resign, saying he had a mandate to govern and needed to protect democracy. </p> <p>\"I will not abandon the ship, and I will take responsibility for the crew on board,\" he said in the almost jocular address that appeared to taunt his opponents. \"I can tell you I will not quit. I will not dissolve parliament. I will stay to protect democracy.\"</p> <p>The thousands of protesters who have occupied the grounds of his Government House offices for the past 10 days greeted the address, relayed to them on loudspeakers, with jeers and resolved to stay until Samak meets their demand to quit.</p> <p>\"As long as he insists on staying on, we will not go anywhere,\" said Sondhi Limthongkul, a Peoples' Alliance for Democracy (PAD) leader, told the cheering throng of demonstrators. \"It doesn't matter how many days or years, or even into the next life.\"</p> <p>Two students among about 100 planning to march on Samak's residence to press him to quit were slightly wounded tonight after gunmen on a motorcycle fired on the procession at it gathered. Both male students from Ramkhamhaeng University were only slightly wounded but the incident showed the potential for violence that could spiral out of control in the volatile political situation. </p> <p>The move to hold a referendum appears to be an attempt by the prime minister to regain the initiative. The declaration of emergency rule failed to change the status quo when the army refused to use force to evict the protesters.</p> <p>Earlier court orders obtained by the government to clear the grounds and arrest the protest leaders also had little effect after the police were unable to serve the notices or dislodged the thousand camped inside the barricaded compound.</p> <p>Emerging from today's cabinet meeting Somsak Kietsuranond, the culture minister, said the government had agreed in principle to stage the referendum.</p> <p>Samak's People Power party, which leads the six-party coalition government elected last December with a substantial majority, would be likely to win any referendum because of its loyal support among the rural poor. </p> <p>But while it is being organised, the political stalemate will grind on for weeks, a prospect that Samak brushed aside. \"While waiting for the result of the referendum, the protesters can demonstrate,\" he said. \"I can wait.\"</p> <p>In his national address Samak confirmed the resignation of his foreign minister, Tej Bunnag, who said he was leaving his post to care for his ailing wife. But the veteran diplomat was known to have close ties to the palace of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, to whom the anti-government protesters pledge allegiance.</p> <p>\"[Tej] has come under pressure from all fronts, so much so that his wife collapsed,\" Samak said. \"I want to avoid bloodshed. I want to avoid a crisis.\"</p> <p>But he described the PAD as a lawless mob and said it was time for Thais to decide which side they were on in the crisis that has pitted the urban elite anti-government demonstrators against the rural poor.</p> <p>Clashes between the rival groups that left one man dead and 43 injured early on Tuesday prompted Samak to declare emergency rule in Bangkok.</p>",
  "<p><br>The great escape ... EMI bought out Mariah Carey after she suffered a 'nervous breakdown' . Photograph: PR</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/music/2008/08/when_record_deals_go_wrong_and.html\">Last week</a>, I discussed how Jared Leto's band 30 Seconds to Mars invoked the California Labor Law to try and wriggle out of their record deal. Of course, you can only use that law if your deal was actually signed in California. Snoop Dogg found that out in 2006 when attempting to <a href=\"http://www.allbusiness.com/services/legal-services/4464783-1.html\">end his publishing deal with EMI</a> so he could sign a more lucrative one with a rival company. His music may be West Coast, but a court ruled the deal - which was signed in NYC - wasn't.</p> <p>So, for all the artists who don't live in the Golden State, here are some other ways to escape a record deal.</p> <p><strong>Suffer a physical and emotional breakdown</strong> Like Mariah Carey did only months after signing a record deal with EMI's Virgin Records for a reported $80m. After releasing an album (Glitter) that was less than successful by her standards, (not to mention the movie of Glitter) the label decided that it was more economically viable to <a href=\"http://www.livedaily.com/news/4254.html\">buy her contract out</a> for $28m - only a year after it was originally signed - than to keep her on the roster. She went on to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1976824.stm\">sign with Island/Def Jam</a> that same year for $20m, and has since released some of her most successful albums to date.</p> <p><strong>Use a key-man clause</strong> Granted, this requires a bit of forward thinking. Every couple of years, most major labels go through a culling procedure, sacking anyone that they believe has under-performed (if this is an executive, he/she will be handsomely rewarded by a \"golden handshake\"). Before you know it, you may find yourself without anyone championing your cause. So, think ahead: include a clause in the contract that says you can leave when the person who signed you leaves.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles//article13629.html\">File for bankruptcy</a></strong> This seems to work quite well, as existing contracts can be rejected if they impair your ability to get back on your feet or recover financially. And you don't even have to be completely down-and-out to do it. In 1998, <a href=\"http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/braxton_toni/bio.jhtml\">Toni Braxton filed for Chapter 7</a> (as it's called in the US) - even though her albums had sold an estimated 15m units worldwide - as she claimed her liabilities exceeded her assets. TLC, who were signed to the same label as Braxton (LaFace) <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434892/19970909/tlc.jhtml\">had done the same thing</a> a few years earlier, only to re-sign with LaFace, but under much more favorable conditions.</p> <p><strong>Give the label too many albums.</strong> Warner Bros Records refused to release the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/L\u00e4ther-Frank-Zappa/dp/B0000009TT\">quadruple-LP L\u00e4ther</a> Frank Zappa recorded in the 70s, thinking it would be commercial suicide. After Zappa then played it on a radio show and encouraged listeners to tape it, he and the label had a Mexican stand-off. Even though he was prevented from recording for a year, he did get out of the deal. He subsequently released his most successful album, Joe's Garage (a triple-LP) on his own label.</p> <p><strong>Claim the contract is void because you were a minor when you signed it.</strong> Of course, you must actually have been underage, but since many labels seem to want their artists as young as possible (I was once asked to write for an 11-year-old Christian-crossover boy), it's likely you may have been.</p> <p>Whatever you do, though, don't try the \"the contract is patently unfair\" approach, no matter how bad and one-sided the terms are. It didn't work for <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E0D8103DF931A15755C0A962958260\">George Michael</a> and almost certainly won't for you, as the court will say: \"You still signed it.\"</p> <p>Instead, do it the Dave Lee way. Or should I say the Joey Negro, Raven Maze and Jakatta way. They're all <a href=\"http://dancemusic.about.com/od/remixersproducers/a/JoeyNegroInt.htm\">DJ/Producer Dave Lee's aliases</a> and have recorded for different labels without any problem.</p> <p>Failing that, record a few really crap albums and watch how quickly they'll drop you. Then start your own label, selling directly to the fans you've accumulated through the years. If you haven't lost them by releasing crap records, that is.</p>",

  "<p>The legacy of the 'wars' is much more than unexploded land mines and lost cattle. It is about lost chances that leave whole families marginalised, beyond the reach of development.</p> <p>Egabu is now seven, the youngest of a large family fathered by Michael Ebigu who sells tobacco. He's at Katine on market days, sitting cross-legged on the ground, in a row with other tobacco sellers, in the long narrow shade of the thatched market shelter.</p> <p>On other days he sets up at the Tiriri trading post a few miles down the highway that the Chinese are rebuilding \u2013 it will one day link the north of the African continent with the south.</p> <p>The trading post is the public face of one of the displacement camps set up by the government during the insurgency. Most families have returned home, but Michael's third wife Rose lives here with the youngest children.</p> <p>Egabu, always a sickly child, was born in the short lull between insurrections. When the Lord's Resistance Army swept south in 2003, the whole family quit their land and the second-hand clothes stall that Michael ran. They lost everything.</p> <p>In the displacement camp, Egabu's mysterious sickness slowly worsened. Neither the hospital in Soroti nor the larger one in neighbouring Kumi was able to help.</p> <p>\"Now he's blind,\" Michael says. \"The hospital in Soroti can't do anything. We would like to take him back to Kumi, but we have no money. There is no support at all for sick children.\"</p> <p>Rose Agado is 38, the youngest of Michael's three wives.

  "<p>\"When Israel was first created, I had a lot of admiration and respect for the Jews; now I want to throw them all into the sea.\" The choice of phraseology was no accident on the part of the speaker, who wanted to make crystal clear the effects that more than 40 years of Israeli occupation have had on him and his family. </p> <p>We were sitting in his tent in the Bedouin village of Umm al-Kheir, situated just outside the perimeter fence of the West Bank settlement of Karmel. Thanks to Karmel's proximity, the Bedouins suffer <a href=\"http://villagesgroup.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/umm-al-kheir-bedouin-village-suffers-settler-harrassment/\">almost daily harassment</a> at the hands of the settlers and their security team, resulting in the vitriolic volte-face performed by the head of the family in terms of his feelings towards Israelis. </p> <p>The residents of Umm al-Kheir, and several other villages in the area, are prevented from building on their own land, or from grazing their flocks in the pastures nearby, due to the severe restrictions imposed on them by the army and police. In order to protect the ever-expanding settlements, more and more land is annexed under the guise of erecting \"security zones\", effectively strangling the natural growth of the Palestinian communities, and destroying their livelihoods in one fell swoop. </p> <p>Their sorry situation is by no means unique; similar repressive tactics are used throughout the West Bank. The policy was described to me by a local activist as \"ethnic cleansing by stealth\", with the ultimate aim being to make life so tough for the Palestinians that they hold their hands up in despair and relocate elsewhere. Where they go is of little interest to those holding the reins of Israeli power, so long as it's far enough away for the vacated land to be redistributed to a new generation of settlers.</p> <p>This type of low-level bullying is neither sensational nor violent enough to make regular headlines in either the local or international media, but its effects are no less harshly felt just because the methods employed are less violent than all out brute force. Erecting roadblocks at the entrance of villages to force the residents to take hour-long detours; taking no action against settlers who routinely <a href=\"http://www.imemc.org/article/56214\">beat and harass</a> Palestinian children on their way to school; demolishing shacks built in the middle of the desert on the pretext of being security risks: the army's actions play a huge part in making the impoverished Palestinians' already difficult lives ten times harder.</p> <p>Judaism <a href=\"http://jlaw.com/Articles/placingstumbling.html\">teaches</a> its adherents not to \"place a stumbling block before the blind\"; yet \u2013 as is seen time and again \u2013 despite ostensibly being a Jewish state, Israel pays scant attention to the laws of our religion, and runs its business according to an entirely different rulebook. Against this backdrop, it is easy to see why the clan chief of Umm al-Kheir has lost all faith in the Israelis under whose control he is forced to live. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/09/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">similar effect</a> has been had on the village of Nil'in, which I visited a day later. The town is having the life slowly crushed from its lungs, with the annexation of vast tracts of its farmland by the army, and the separation wall being erected through its fields. Two children have died at the hands of the IDF during recent protests, with dozens more seriously wounded from rubber bullets and live rounds, only adding fuel to the already raging fire in the hearts of the locals. </p> <p>One family I visited had a huge Hamas flag hung prominently in the centre of their lounge, testament to their own growing disillusion with the idea that they could ever live on peaceful terms with those occupying and oppressing them. The youngest children of the house silently emptied a bag of spent missiles on to the coffee table, wanting to ram home to their guests the kind of experience they had growing up in the shadow of the IDF. </p> <p>Rubber bullets, tear gas canisters, stun grenades and sound bombs were all laid out for our benefit; chubby hands grasping the weapons of war, and eyes which had seen far too much peering at the visitors to see what kind of response their display elicited. \"They can even tell just from the sound what kind of ammunition the soldiers are shooting\", said their father with a shake of his head, while outside their older siblings prepared for yet another demonstration against the bulldozers scything their way through the town's olive groves. </p> <p>If the Israeli authorities' aim is truly to protect their citizens, then their tactics are backfiring on a massive scale. As I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/22/israelandthepalestinians.fear\">said before</a>, all that is happening is simply a case of Israel creating what it fears, and driving ordinary Palestinians into the welcoming arms of the extremists. At the climax of the film <a href=\"http://www.adulthoodthemovie.co.uk/\">Adulthood</a>, Sam \u2013 wielding a loaded gun as he stares at his enemies with fire in his eyes \u2013 warns: \"Never fuck with a guy who ain't got nothing to lose\"; his mantra could be the motto of Palestinians the length and breadth of the Occupied Territories. </p> <p>With every passing day, and every cruel and unusual punishment meted out against farmers, villagers, students and labourers alike, Israel is fomenting more and more hate against its own people, and ensuring months and years of conflict to come. More than that, they are undermining their own desired goal of a two state solution, since the carving-up of the West Bank to make way for Jewish-only access roads and buffer zones around settlements erodes any chance of a viable Palestinian state being created. </p> <p>Those who are too blind to see that this is what is occurring under their noses are the same people who convince themselves that the true aim of Israel is to live in peace with its neighbours. The Palestinians, however, live and breathe the reality every day of their lives, and they are not so easily fooled. And if they are to be prevented from feeling as though they've got nothing to lose and resorting once more to violent resistance, there needs to be a major change in the way Israel treats their, and their children's, human rights and needs.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> As a glance at the above photo will confirm, the last time Jamie Murray won a grand slam mixed doubles title he could only see out of one eye. That has to be good news from a British perspective, because the more modestly coiffed 2008 vintage comes fully equipped with peripheral vision. So should we expect Murray, who partners Liezel Huber in tonight's US Open final against Cara Black and Leander Paes, the No5 seeds, to repeat the Wimbledon victory he achieved in tandem with Jelena Jankovic last summer? Yes and no.</p> <p>On the plus side, Murray and Huber are in fine fettle. They've dropped just one set en route to the final, and that was against the second seeds, Katarina Srebotnik and Nenad Zimonjic - a pair who have contested four grand slam mixed doubles finals, including three in succession at Roland Garros, where they were the champions in 2006. What's more, Huber - as you'd expect from the joint world No1 - knows her way around a doubles court, having won twice at Wimbledon and once in Australia.</p> <p>The bad news? Each of Huber's grand slam wins was achieved alongside tonight's opponent, Black, who therefore has not only a similar pedigree - indeed, she shares the No1 ranking with Huber - but also a more accomplished partner: Paes, a former world No1 in doubles, has 39 titles to his name, including eight majors. He's also a total genius in the forecourt, so Murray and Huber will have their work cut out.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 0-1 Paes*/Black </strong>It takes Paes all of three seconds to demonstrate that the fifth seeds means business. Having fired an early warning shot across the Murray bows by slamming an overhead at the Briton's nether regions on the opening point, Calcutta's finest wraps up his opening service game to 15 with a beautiful half-volley winner down the line. First blood to the seeded pair.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 1-1 Paes/Black </strong>Paes - playing in the deuce court, which is unusual for the man in mixed - struggles to make much impression against the Murray serve, which the Briton directs accurately into the Indian's body. No quarter given so far; Murray holds to 15.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 1-2 Paes/Black* </strong>Murray and Huber squander a promising position at 15-30 on the Black serve, the Scot failing to control a volley after a rapid-fire exchange at the net. The seeded pair hold to 30, but there were some promising signs there for Murray and Huber.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 2-2 Paes/Black </strong>Huber holds with considerably greater ease than Black, who shanks a forehand return horribly on the final point. Murray and Huber hold to love, and it would be fair to say they've looked the more impressive pairing on the return so far.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 2-3 Paes*/Black </strong>A double fault from Paes at 30-15 suggests that the first break of the match might be on the cards, but the Indian snuffs out the danger with two stinging wide serves, neither of which are returned.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 3-3 Paes/Black </strong>Paes stretches Murray wide on the opening point with an acutely-angled forehand return, but the Scot responds with a wonderful pick up on the half-volley to regain the initiative. After double faulting on the next point, Murray takes control of the game with some fine serving to hold to 15. Now let's see if they can make an impression on the Black serve.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 3-4 Paes/Black* </strong>Despite again looking vulnerable on serve, Black holds to 30 once more. Two fine returns carry Murray and Huber to 0-30, but Paes then imposes himself at the net and Black completes the hold with a solid smash at Huber's ankles.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 4-4 Paes/Black </strong>It's Huber's turn to be tested, and the world's finest female doubles player comes through in convincing fashion. Paes steps up the pace on the return, and Huber quickly finds herself 15-30 down. She subsequently double faults to bring up two break points, but Murray makes a fine interception and a solid serve takes it to deuce, from where it's sudden-death. Huber makes no mistake, Black failing to control another deep delivery as the unseeded pair stay firmly in contention.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 4-5 Paes*/Black </strong>Paes holds again, although it's slightly less comfortable for the Indian maestro this time as Murray and Huber scramble to fashion a break opportunity at 40-30. It comes to nought and Murray will have to serve to stay in the opening set.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray*/Huber 5-5 Paes/Black </strong>Murray holds comfortably to maintain the status quo. It'll be interesting to see how Black, who has looked the most breakable of the quartet so far, fares on serve at the business end of the set.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber 5-6 Paes/Black* </strong>Paes was obviously thinking along similar lines to me - he takes matters in hand with some typically adroit net play, and Black completes her most comfortable hold to date.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>First set: Murray/Huber* 6-6 Paes/Black </strong>Huber, her turquoise outfit flecked with visible signs of endeavour even before she stepped up to serve, was certainly sweating there. At 40-30 she appeared to have double faulted, setting up a sudden-death point that would have left Paes and Black within a point of the opening set. Instead, a successful appeal to Hawkeye results in the point being replayed. Huber finds a solid first delivery, Murray slams away the volley, and a tiebreak beckons.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Paes/Black win the first set 7-6 (8-6)</strong>Huber hits a beautiful forehand topspin lob winner to give the unseeded pair a 3-1 lead in the tiebreak. Paes holds both his service points in typically robust style, but a brutal smash from Murray brings up two set points for Murray and Huber at 6-4. Black, though, pulls off a superb reaction volley to save the first, and Murray then misses a sitter at the net to make it honours even at 6-6. Paes and Black make the most of the reprieve, reaching set point following a Huber groundstroke error before Paes slams away a backhand volley to wrap up the opener. The Indian lets out a huge bellow after that one, and no wonder.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 1-0 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Murray puts the disappointment of the tiebreak behind him with a solid service game, but that missed volley will come back to haunt him if they lose this now.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 1-1 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>A game in which two break points go begging just about sums things up for Murray and Huber, who have failed to make the most of the openings that have come their way so far. Having been the hapless recipient of a 119mph ace at 30-40, Murray nets an inviting second serve on the next point. He'll have to do better at the key moments if they're going to get back into this.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber* 2-1 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Huber lets out a squeal of delight after recovering from break point down to keep it on serve.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 2-2 Paes/Black*; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>After an uncertain start, Black is going from strength to strength on serve; another convincing hold for the fifth seeds.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 2-3 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>It's been coming, if truth be told. Murray hasn't looked a happy bunny since letting the first set slip with that netted volley, and his discomfort manifest itself here in the form of two double faults. Murray hangs on gamely to reach deuce, but a fine return from Paes on the sudden-death deuce point has the Scot stretching, enabling Black to make another decisive intervention at the net. That's the first break of the match, and it'll be a long road back for Murray and Huber now.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 2-4 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Aided by some sharp volleying from the increasingly confident Black, Paes consolidates the break.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber* 3-4 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Another sudden-death denouement, another scare for Murray and Huber. This time, though, they hold on, although only after Huber has heartened club players everywhere with a protracted demonstration of how difficult it can be to put away an easy volley.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 3-5 Paes/Black*; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Black holds again as the seeded pair move within a game of the title.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray*/Huber 4-5 Paes/Black; Paes/Black lead by one set to love </strong>Murray puts the memory of that dropped service game behind him, although only after Paes has teased him with a typical display of forecourt guile at 30-0. Still, if Murray and Huber are to stay alive they'll have to make an impression on the Paes serve, something they've failed to do throughout.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Second set: Murray/Huber 4-6 Paes*/Black; Paes/Black win by two sets to love </strong>There's a brief glimmer of hope for Murray and Huber when Paes misses an easy overhead on the opening point, but the Indian draws on all his formidable experience to seal the game - and with it, the title. Murray is once again culpable at the net when he fluffs a makeable volley at 30-15, but you've got to hand it to Paes and Black: throughout a tight match, they've simply been tougher on the key points.</p>",

With heavy sarcasm, Roger Simon of Politico says he would like to <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13143.html\">apologise on behalf of the \"elite media\"</a> for asking \"mean\" questions about Palin.</p> <blockquote> <p>We should have stuck to the warm, human interest stuff like how she likes mooseburgers.</p> </blockquote> <p>It was not the media's place, he muses, to ask questions about how well John McCain had vetted her and whether she was his first choice as running mate.<br> And on <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/09/lisanova.html\">YouTube</a>, comedian Lisa Nova imagines the phone conversation between Palin and McCain when he asked her to be his running mate. </p> <p>One of the funniest impressions of Palin comes from 27-year-old New York comedian <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/SaraBenincasa\">Sara Benincasa</a>. She too tells the \"funny story\" of how an \"older gentleman\" invited her to be the Republican candidate for vice-president. But wait until the end when she vents her fury at coming second in the Miss Alaska contest. \"It does not matter that I did not win the f***ing beauty pageant,\" she fumes. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEW12XLUM7A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/qEW12XLUM7A&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/qEW12XLUM7A&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwRnOHsRS48&amp;watch_response\">Ballad of Sarah Palin \u2013 Queen of the Alaskan Frontier</a> is worth a watch.

  "<p>Five years after John Renehan thought he had cremated his father, the pair are back together in a case of memory loss, mistaken identity and serendipity.</p> <p>Renehan's father, John Delaney, went missing in 2000. Three years later, a badly decomposed body found in the bushes at Manchester Royal Infirmary - wearing similar clothes and with similar old wounds \u2013 was identified by police as Delaney.</p> <p>A coroner confirmed the identification and Renehan had a cremation for the person he thought was his father. </p> <p>In April, Renehan, who was doing night shifts for the first time in his life, happened to be watching a daytime television programme about missing persons. To his astonishment, Renahan recognised his father.</p> <p>The 42-year-old father <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1065339_cremated_dad_living_in_care_home\">told the Manchester Evening News</a>: \"I had just finished my night shift and was getting ready to go to sleep when I turned on the TV. As I was turning away I got a glimpse of who I thought was my father. For the rest of the day I could not get to sleep. I was in shock. We thought we had cremated my dad. But I knew it was him.\"</p> <p>It turns out that, Delaney, 71, has been in a care home for the past eight years after being found wandering dazed and confused in Oldham. He apparently suffered memory loss and was unable to hold a proper conversation after receiving a blow to the head 10 days earlier.</p> <p>Unable to identify him, the authorities gave Delaney the name David Harrison and placed in a home. His family filed a missing person report at the time of his disappearance and police issued a public appeal with his photograph but no information was received. </p> <p>Oldham Social Services, which was caring for Delaney, was unable to put out an appeal for information until a law change this year meant they did not require his consent, paving the way for the TV appeal. </p> <p>Delaney and Renehan were reunited two weeks ago after DNA tests confirmed they were indeed father and son. Renehan - who took his mother's maiden name after his parents split up - is now spending part of every day with his father and claims the elderly man's memory is beginning to improve.</p> <p>Renehan is angry that no DNA checks were run by police on the body found in 2003 and says he still has sleepless nights thinking of the family of the man he had cremated. He is demanding an apology for his trauma over the past five years.</p> <p>Nigel Meadows, a coroner, is set to apply to the high court to quash the inquest which confirmed the dead man as Delaney and recorded an open verdict. It is understood Meadows, who was not in the post in 2003, accepts that DNA evidence was not commonly used to identify decomposed bodies at the time.</p> <p>The decomposed body found in 2003 was mistakenly identified as Delaney - who was homeless before he went missing \u2013 as both men were wearing similar jeans and tops, and both had historic head and rib wounds.</p> <p>Manchester police, who put out a missing person alert when Delaney disappeared, have admitted that \"mistakes were made\".</p> <p>Peter Fahy, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, expressed his \"great sympathy\" for Renehan and his family.</p> <p>He said: \"This is an awful situation for the man to find his father is still alive and he's had no contact with him. I have the greatest sympathy with the family. I think the public will appreciate this is a difficult situation where you have a very badly decomposed body. We will need to review what happened here with the coroner.\"</p>",

Anyone expecting a low-key character study of America's first openly gay politician looks likely to be disappointed, because if this first trailer is anything to go by, Gus Van Sant's Milk is going to be a Big movie tackling Big subjects.</p> <p>It's also got a pretty Big cast. Sean Penn stars as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Milk\">Harvey Milk</a> himself, with James Franco playing his life partner, Scott Smith, and the ubiquitous Josh Brolin as his eventual killer, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_White\">Dan White</a>.</p> <p>Milk was elected city supervisor of San Francisco in 1978, a time when America was even less comfortable with homosexuality than it is today (<a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38178\">check out the comments on Ain't It Cool News' article</a> if you doubt me). Whether White was as much of a homophobe in real life as in Van Sant's version of events is perhaps a moot point: the film-maker looks set to choose polemic over realism, and perhaps that's appropriate for a movie about such a defining character.</p> <p>Milk appears to be a bit of a return to the mainstream for Van Sant after the Good Will Hunting director's self-imposed exile in indieland since around 2002. What are your thoughts on this one?</p>",
  "<h2>Mike Fuller, chief constable of Kent police</h2> <p>Fuller became the Kent chief constable in 2004 after a 26-year career with the Met. During his time at Scotland Yard he helped set up Operation Trident, tackling gun crime within African-Caribbean communities. He is a former chair of the Black Police Assocation. As a detective superintendent based at the Home Office, he carried out inspections relating to crime and counter-terrorism in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. A qualified barrister, he helped set up the groundbreaking racial and violent crime taskforce in response to criticism of the Metropolitan police.</p> <h2>Sir Hugh Orde, chief constable of the Northern Ireland police service</h2> <p>Orde joined the Metropolitan police in 1977. He took part in the latter phase of the inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and its handling by police. In April 1999, he was the officer in command of the investigation in the Brixton bombing and was responsible for the development of Operation Trident. As deputy assistant commissioner, he was assigned to the senior staff of the Stevens report, which investigated government collusion in sectarian murders in Northern Ireland. He was knighted in 2005.</p> <h2>Bernard Hogan-Howe, chief constable of Merseyside police</h2> <p>Hogan-Howe joined South Yorkshire police in 1979 where he worked as district commander for Doncaster West. He moved to Merseyside police in 1997 and was gold commander during the petrol disputes of 2000/2001. He became assistant commissioner at the Met in July 2001 and led a team that recruited 10,000 officers in three years. Hogan-Howe has called for a \"total war on crime\" and has argued that the health and safety case successfully brought against the Met after the Jean Charles de Menezes shooting restricts police in their work. He called for a review of the decision to downgrade cannabis from a class B to a class C drug (now repealed). He has an MA in law from Oxford University, and a diploma in applied criminology and an MBA from Sheffield University.</p> <h2>Sir Norman Bettison, chief constable of West Yorkshire police</h2> <p>Bettison left school aged 16 to join South Yorkshire police as a cadet. By 1993 he had been appointed assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire police. In 1998 he became chief constable of Merseyside police, where he stayed for six years despite early problems when it was reported that he had been involved in the investigation of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Steve Foulkes, a member of the Merseyside Police Authority, said Bettison's appointment had caused \"outrage and extra grief\" among families of the Hillsborough victims. Bettison offered to meet the relatives to defuse the controversy. He retired from the police in January 2005 to become chief executive of Centrex, but rejoined two years later as chief constable of West Yorkshire. He has an MA in philosophy and psychology from Oxford University, and an MA in business administration and media studies from Sheffield Hallam University. He was knighted in 2006.</p> <h2>Sir Paul Stephenson, deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan police</h2> <p>Stephenson joined the police force in 1975 and was appointed superintendent in 1988. Six years later he was appointed assistant chief constable of Merseyside police, where he worked on tackling gun crime, corruption and terrorist activity. He became chief constable of Lancashire police and was appointed deputy commissioner of the Met, a role in which he oversees strategy, organisational performance and diversity. He was knighted this year.</p>",
  "<p><br>Great to be British? ... spectators at the Olympic handover celebrations in London in August. Photograph: Daniel Deme/EPA</p> <p>I am seriously fed up of hearing about \"the depth of talent and creativity that the UK has to offer\" every time London 2012 is mentioned. The organisers of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/sep/04/cultural.olympiad.coe\">2012 Olympics have today announced details</a> of London's <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/get-involved/cultural-olympiad/index.php\">\"Cultural Olympiad\"</a>, the orbiting artistic events that Olympic cities feel they must offer to maximise tourist profits, sorry, celebrate talent and creativity. And it strikes me as positively offensive that it so blatantly sets out to engulf culture within the nationalism that disfigures modern sport.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to miss most of this summer's Olympics by being on holiday. We caught some of it on Italian TV but it tended to focus on strong Italian sports, like shooting. Yet even in a remote corner of western Sicily it was impossible to avoid a sighting of the Daily Mail's front page: \"GREAT TO BE BRITISH!\" it said. Some swimmers won medals, right? Who cares?</p> <p>Sport is boring so I suppose you need a bit of nationalism to inoculate yourselves to the tedium of watching it. But culture is real. It's about life, death, sex and God/no God. And here is London 2012 roping it into the patriotic bonanza, coarsening, travestying and betraying things that really matter. Things like Shakespeare. The Olympiad's World Shakespeare Festival will celebrate Shakespeare as \"an international property\" - nice of them to acknowledge that - but also, obviously, draw attention to our greatest single object of legitimate cultural pride.</p> <p>The Olympiad will also go heavy on illegitimate cultural pride. There will be \"12 cutting-edge artists' commissions across the UK\". The Olympiad so wants to identify with British art that Sebastian Coe is to run shortly in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/01/art.tatebritain1\">Martin Creed relay at Tate Britain</a>. Yeah, we're the artists of the world. What did America or France ever produce to rival our artists now?</p> <p>Of course, the Cultural Olympiad events claim to be internationalist and global in spirit. But that's the ultimate British complacency. Oh, we're so post-colonial... it's like we want credit as a nation for not being racists. Which we flatter ourselves we're not.</p> <p>I like Britain, actually. Its coastlines, its castles, its language. But all this endless celebration of what's great about the place, and about London especially, is so desperate it's as if no one really believes it. I wonder if such arrogance will withstand the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">economic apocalypse</a> that it seems stands between contemporary London and the year 2012.</p>",
  "<p>Syria today said a round of indirect talks with Israel had been postponed because of the resignation of the chief Israeli negotiator, as Damascus waited for a response to its latest proposals.</p> <p>Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, said Turkish mediators had been given an outline of Syria's general principles for peace and it was waiting for a similar document from Israel before holding any face-to-face negotiations.</p> <p>\"We are now discussing a document of principles, which talks about general principles of the peace process which will be the basis for direct negotiations,\" Assad said at the opening of a summit in Damascus with the leaders of France, Turkey and Qatar to discuss peace efforts in the Middle East.</p> <p>He said his country's proposals focused on defining the extent of Syrian territory under Israeli occupation, as a basis for negotiating an Israeli withdrawal. Israel did not comment on Assad's proposals.</p> <p>The last direct talks between the two countries stalled in 2000 in a dispute over how much of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 war, should be returned to Syria. Israel wants Syria to stop supporting Hamas, the Islamists who control Gaza, and Hizbullah in Lebanon.</p> <p>Israel and Syria have held four rounds of indirect talks under Turkish mediation. Assad said a fifth round of indirect talks had been postponed. </p> <p>\"There was supposed to be a fifth round, meant to be crucial, I think, yesterday. The resignation of the chief Israeli negotiator led to the postponement of this round, which would have defined the course of these negotiations,\" the Syrian president said.<br> Israel's chief negotiator, Yoram Turbowicz, resigned as Ehud Olmert's chief of staff in July, shortly after the prime minister said he would leave office following a vote in his Kadima party to replace him over a corruption scandal. The vote is due on September 17.</p> <p>Turbowicz agreed to continue to represent Israel at the indirect talks with Syria in a voluntary capacity. Israel's attorney-general has yet to authorise his participation.</p> <p>\"We are waiting now for the Israeli elections to decide the future of this stage,\" Assad said. \"We want the support of all states, basically France, Qatar and Turkey, in order to be assured that the next [Israeli] prime minister will follow the same direction Olmert had followed through his readiness for complete withdrawal from the occupied territories in order for peace to be achieved.\"</p> <p>Sarkozy, the president of the EU and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/syria.middleeast\">first western leader to visit Syria in three years</a>, yesterday encouraged direct talks between Syria and Israel. The US and other western powers have shunned Syria, in part because of accusations that Syrian agents were behind the assassination of Rafiq al-Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.</p> <p>Media reports in Israel said the US was irritated at Sarkozy's presence in Damascus. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1017901.html\"> The Ha'aretz newspaper said</a> a US assistant secretary of state, David Welch, was to have participated as an observer at a planned Israeli-Syrian meeting in Turkey, but that the US was not prepared to be a \"tail\" to the French and so Welch's participation was called off. Assad's comments indicate that such a meeting is some way off.</p> <p>Any direct talks would have to wait until a new US president is elected, Assad said, acknowledging the importance of US backing for peace efforts. He said the Syrian proposals were given to the Turkish negotiators \"as a deposit\". When Israel gives its own proposals to the Turkish side, then the two sides could move to direct negotiations, Assad said, \"after a new American administration convinced of the peace process is in place\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London, LA, Paris, Boston, Cincinnati. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Rosemary Moriarty (singer, xylophone, thumb piano, spoons, tambourine, scotch-tape trumpet), Zim Moriarty (double-bass, acoustic guitar, music box, suitcase drum), Thomas Moriarty (chromatic and diatonic harmonicas, kazoo, drilling machines, Jew's harp), Charles Moriarty (electric and resonator guitars), Vincent Talpaert Moriarty (drums, double-bass), Eric Tafani Dubessay Moriarty (drums).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> As you can probably tell from the above lineup, with its myriad esoteric instruments, Moriarty are not your average indie-rock band or streamlined electro-pop unit, even if the presence of \"drilling machines\" makes it sound as though they're going to break into some sort of Einst\u00fcrzende Neubaten-style industrial rock-fest at any moment (or fix your teeth). With members of French, American, Swiss and Vietnamese parentage, based in several cities around the globe, they're a ramshackle olde worlde acoustic outfit with a theatrical bent and a tendency to dress like 1930s Prohibition outlaws who make a mess of sound that takes in folk, country, blues, jazz and cabaret. Their first UK release \u2013 they've already established a huge following in France, where their debut album, Gee Whiz But This is a Lonesome Town, sold 70,000 copies and was certified Gold \u2013 is a single called Jimmy and it sounds like it was recorded around the turn of the last century, all jaunty bluegrass guitar, wistful harmonica and lyrics about roaming buffalo. Meanwhile, Rosemary Moriarty's pure, clear folkish tones, redolent of Joan Baez, make her seem as though she's spent the last few years in the blue ridge mountains of Virginia, on the trail of the lonesome pine. <br> Moriarty, who take their name from Jack Kerouac's lead character in On the Road, may sound like they travel between gigs in a horse and cart, but it's not all sepia-tinged snapshots of the Old West. They do live in the modern world. They recently appeared alongside Morrissey, Babyshambles and My Bloody Valentine at Benicassim, they share their record label, Na\u00efve, with France's First Lady Carla Bruni and there's a reference in one of their songs to a dominatrix (the last two facts are unconnected, by the way). They've even done a cover version of Depeche Mode's Enjoy the Silence, and if that sounds weird, look at some of the strange places they've played gigs in the past year alone: a mental institution, a prison, a transatlantic ship, a ruined castle in Tuscany, the streets of Paris, and a night train. But then, by all accounts, Moriarty are quite into the surreal and believe in \"animism\": the idea that some objects, animals and plants, as well as humans, have a soul, be it a squeaking floorboard, a hotel bell, or a whisk. They're also into Lewis Carroll, which makes sense, or rather nonsense. Depending on your taste, Moriarty will either be a musical wonderland, or some kind of hell on earth.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"A real troupe of modern bohemian gypsies, their concerts are like happenings. Free, innocent and magnificent, like music should always be.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> They're a real Marmite band \u2013 you'll either love them or want to vomit on sight.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Go \"yee haw!\" between songs. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Do a medley of their single Jimmy with the Undertones' Jimmy Jimmy.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Jimmy is released by Naive on December 8, followed by the album Gee Whiz But This is a Lonesome Town in February 2009. <br> <strong>File next to: </strong>Gogol Bordello, Gypsy Kings, Tom Waits, Sweet By And By. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/moriartylands\">www.myspace.com/moriartylands</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Mama Shamone. </p>",
  "<p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, today attacked Russia's invasion of Georgia, describing it as \"an illegitimate, unilateral attempt\" to change the country's borders, and saying that there were now \"grave doubts\" about Russia's reliability as an international partner.</p> <p>In comments likely to further sharpen the division between Moscow and Washington, Cheney said the US was \"fully committed\" to Georgia \u2013 and its efforts to join Nato. \"Georgia will be in our alliance,\" Cheney said, following talks in Tbilisi this morning with Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. </p> <p>Cheney's trip, which will see him fly to Ukraine later today, is designed to demonstrate the US's resolve in supporting Georgia, despite its brief and disastrous war with Russia last month, and the continuing occupation of much of the country by Russian troops.</p> <p>Today Cheney said that the US would remain at Georgia's side \"as you work to overcome an invasion of your sovereign territory and an illegitimate, unilateral attempt to change your country's borders by force that has been universally condemned by the free world\".</p> <p>He added: \"Russia's actions have cast grave doubts on Russia's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner.\"</p> <p>The Bush administration yesterday announced a $1bn (\u00a3500m) humanitarian and economic assistance package to rebuild the country's civilian infrastructure, severely damaged by Russian bombardment during last month's brief conflict.</p> <p>But there was no mention from Cheney today as to whether the US now intends to help Georgia re-equip its battered military, severely mauled during its fight with Russia \u2013 a contentious issue that could escalate the standoff in the region between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p>Instead, Cheney praised Georgia's contribution in Iraq, as the third largest contributor of troops, saying: \"Now it is the responsibility of the free world to rally to the side of Georgia.\" Today Saakashvili said he was committed to the peaceful resolution of Georgia's disputes with the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, whose independence Moscow recognized last week. </p> <p>Saakashvili also said that \"two thirds of the population of South Ossetia\" had been subjected to ethnic cleaning since last month \u2013 with Georgians driven and burned out of their homes by South Ossetian militias. \"If someone wishes to legalise the results of this ethnic cleansing, this means legalising people's tragedy,\" Saakashvili said.</p> <p>Cheney visited Azerbaijan yesterday, in a trip he said was designed to underline America's \"deep and abiding interests\" in the region. Russia has accused the US of trying to destabilise the situation in the Caucasus \u2013 with the prime minister, Vladimir Putin, claiming that Washington both knew about, and took part in, Georgia's offensive last month against South Ossetia.</p> <p>Today Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's hawkish representative to Nato, warned that Russia would respond angrily if Georgia were ever allowed join the transatlantic military alliance. Rogozin said Moscow would halt cooperation with Nato over Afghanistan. He also described as \"insolent\" a visit planned for September 15-16 to Tbilisi by Nato's secretary general Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. </p> <p>The dispatch of Cheney to the area is in itself a message. Cheney leads the hawkish wing of the Bush administration, and has championed taking a tough line with Russia. He is the most senior member of the US administration to visit Georgia so far.</p> <p>Yesterday Moscow's ambassador to London, Yuri Fedotov, said that Russia would withdraw its troops from the \"buffer zone\" it has created in Georgia only when they could be replaced by international peacekeepers and once the Georgian government had signed non-aggression pacts with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Fedotov said he \"deplored\" the severe criticism of Russia voiced recently by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the foreign secretary, David Miliband. He claimed to have repeatedly warned the Foreign Office about the worsening crisis in Georgia in the weeks leading up to August 7, when the conflict ignited. He said he had been assured that Saakashvili was \"under control\". The Foreign Office rejected Fedotov's account.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador was speaking to a group of journalists about the prospects for a deal at a summit next Monday, when the French and current EU president, Nicolas Sarkozy is due to fly to Moscow with the head of the EU commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the European foreign policy head, Javier Solana, to meet Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev.</p> <p>\"I'm not in a position to anticipate the outcome of Monday's discussion, but if the EU proposes a very clear plan on how to prevent a potential confrontation and further shelling in the territory of South Ossetia ... then it's not difficult to deploy 200 or 400 people in the zones and to allow Russia to withdraw its personnel,\" Fedotov said.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England today kept interest rates unchanged in its battle to control inflation, despite growing expectations that the economy is sliding into recession.</p> <p>For the fifth month running, the Bank's monetary policy committee voted to leave rates at 5%, disappointing already struggling homeowners who had hoped for cheaper mortgages. The City had widely expected no change, with the likelihood of a cut put at 45%.</p> <p>The European Central Bank also left interest rates unchanged today, at 4.25%</p> <p>Despite the slowdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/13/inflation.creditcrunch1\">inflation has soared </a>because of higher food prices and energy costs. Last month the consumer prices index hit 4.4%, the highest in 16 years and more than twice the Bank's target of 2%. </p> <p>\"Despite the very real danger of recession, it was always likely to prove premature for the Bank to cut interest rates, given well above-target and rising inflation, still significant medium-term inflation risks and the weakness of the pound,\" said Howard Archer at Global Insight. The pound has slid to a 12-year low against a trade-weighted basket of major currencies. He said the minutes of the MPC meeting should make interesting reading when they are released in two weeks' time and will be scoured for signs of whether the committee has shifted further towards cutting interest rates. <br> The Bank is caught in a dilemma as it risks either prolonging the economic downturn or letting inflation spiral out of control. Most economists in the City believe high inflation will force the Bank to keep rates unchanged until the end of the year but many expect at least one rate cut next year when inflation is expected to ease. Oil prices have come off their recent record highs of $148 (\u00a381.2) a barrel and now trade below $110 but gas and electricity prices are still going up.</p> <p>However, as the economic outlook has deteriorated, the chances of a rate cut later this year have increased, with November or December seen as the most likely month.</p> <p>\"The MPC has a delicate balancing act to perform,\" said Andrew Goodwin at the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club. \"With recent data suggesting that the UK economy is heading towards recession, there is a risk that inflation could undershoot the target over the two-year horizon. With oil prices having fallen sharply in recent months and no sign of any second-round effects on wages, we expect the Bank to reduce interest rates once there are clear signs that inflation has peaked. This could be as early as the end of this year.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/04/houseprices.property\">House prices are tumbling</a>, posting the biggest annual fall in August - of 12.7% - since records began in the early 80s, Britain's largest lender Halifax said today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/03/unemploymentdata.economics1\">Unemployment </a>has risen by 70,000 so far this year and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/03/unemploymentdata.economics\">consumer confidence </a>is at an all-time low.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/02/economicgrowth.creditcrunch\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development this week predicted a recession </a>for Britain. In its gloomiest forecast so far, the OECD estimated the UK will shrink 0.3% in the third quarter and 0.4% in the fourth. The prediction came hot on the heels of stark comments by the chancellor, Alistair Darling, who warned the slump would be deeper and longer than expected.</p> <p>The Bank's policy makers are also becoming more concerned about the downturn. Its deputy governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/26/bankofenglandgovernor.economicgrowth\">Charles Bean</a>, warned last week that the economy was facing a period \"at least as challenging\" as the 70s, when Britain sank into a deep recession. David Blanchflower has voted for a rate cut in recent months as he is worried about the possibility of a prolonged and deep recession.</p> <p>The Bank's dilemma should ease next year. \"While truly dire economic data could prompt another 2008 cut, we remain of the view that it is more likely that the committee will wait until early next year to ease again, especially in view of the recent slide in sterling,\" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.</p> <p>The difficulty of the Bank's task was apparent last month when its rate-setting committee split three ways over the direction of interest rates. Seven MPC members voted to leave borrowing costs on hold, rejecting calls from Tim Besley for a quarter-point increase and from Blanchflower for a cut.</p> <p>James Knightley at ING thinks there was a three-way split again this month, with Besley voting for a hike, Blanchflower for a cut and the rest for no change owing to the dilemma of weaker growth and soaring price pressures. \"Given our view that the UK has entered recession and is unlikely to exit until next summer, we believe that price pressures will moderate and this will open the door for aggressive interest rate cuts,\" he said. He sees rates falling to 3.5% next year. </p> <p>There are some tentative encouraging signs: Britain's service industries shrank for a fourth month running in August but activity picked up and inflationary pressures receded. The improvement suggests the slump in the sector, which ranges from cafes to telecoms and makes up three-quarters of the economy, may have bottomed out.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, said today there was no truth in a report that ministers, officials and senior police chiefs were secretly discussing plans to remove him before his contract runs out in February 2010. </p> <p>Quoting from Mark Twain, he told reporters outside Scotland Yard: \"The report of my death is an exaggeration. I have a job to do: I am getting on with it and will continue to do so.\" </p> <p>He said there had been no discussions about whether his contract should be renewed, but he failed to say whether he wanted an extension. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4670564.ece\">The Times today reported</a> one senior source as saying \"the grey suits are gathering\", while another \"well-placed\" source was quoted as saying: \"He has become the issue. There comes a point when fairness has nothing to do with it and what matters is the integrity of the organisation.\"</p> <p>Scotland Yard said in a statement that no discussions had taken place about Blair's contract. \"The commissioner still has 18 months to serve on his original contract and has had no discussions with anyone about this being extended and has received no written correspondence on this matter.\"</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said: \"The home secretary has full confidence in Sir Ian Blair and the Home Office has been involved in no discussions of this nature.</p> <p>\"Sir Ian Blair has a year and a half of his contract to run and it is far too early to be making decisions about whether or not it should be extended.</p> <p>A Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) spokesman said: \"The procedure followed by the MPA is to write to serving Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) rank officers, together with their line managers, 18 months prior to the culmination of an existing contract to seek their views of extending that contract.</p> <p>\"In the case of the Commissioner of the Metropolis, a royal appointment, the views of the home secretary would be sought.\"</p> <p>He said no letters had been or were about to be sent in the case of Blair.</p> <p>Blair, 55, has regularly been criticised in the media since taking over Britain's top policing job, and has been unpopular with some members of his own rank and file who feel he is too politically correct.</p> <p>But as he pointed out in his statement, most commissioners in the past 30 years have served only one five-year term anyway. The exception was Sir Paul Condon, who was in office for seven years during the 1990s.</p> <p>Most recently, Blair has become embroiled in an embarrassing high-profile row with one of his most senior colleagues and Britain's highest ranking Muslim officer, Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/29/police.race\">accused him of racial discrimination</a>.</p> <p>Last November, Blair survived a no-confidence vote from his force's presiding body, the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), over the fatal shooting of the Brazilian electrician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/menezes\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a>, who was mistaken by officers for a suicide bomber. The Met was found guilty in a criminal court case of breaking health and safety laws over the July 2005 killing.</p> <p>Although crime overall has fallen, the recent spate of teenage knife crime has not enhanced Blair's reputation.</p> <p>The Times said senior officials were planning to move against him once he had acted as a \"lightning conductor\" for criticism expected when an inquest into the Brazilian's death is held later this month. Several senior police chiefs have already been suggested as a successor.</p> <p>The procedure for terminating Blair's contract early lies in the Police Act 1996, which states that the MPA and the home secretary can call upon the commissioner \"to retire in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness\".</p>",
  "<p>A group of prominent Palestinian figures has proposed a radical change in strategy to demand a single, bi-national state if the current round of Middle East peace talks fails.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.palestinestrategygroup.ps/Regaining_the_Initiative_FINAL_17082008_(English).pdf\">Palestinian Strategy Study Group</a>, an EU-funded project written by 27 leading Palestinian figures from across the political spectrum, argued that the current two-state framework for peace talks is failing to bring the promised independent state. Instead, it suggested ending the negotiation process that has gone on now for nearly 20 years, reconstituting the Palestinian Authority into what might become a \"Palestinian Resistance Authority\", and developing a form of \"smart\" resistance. </p> <p>\"The central aim will be to maximise the cost of continuing occupation for Israel, and to make the whole prospect of unilateral separation unworkable,\" it said. The final, and most striking proposal, is to shift to a \"single state outcome\" as the Palestinians' preferred goal. This, it said, would regain the strategic initiative for the Palestinians.</p> <p>\"Although many Palestinians may still prefer a genuine negotiated two-state solution, a failure of the present Annapolis initiative will greatly strengthen those who argue against this,\" the report said. \"Most Palestinians are then likely to be convinced that a negotiated agreement is no longer possible.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time a bi-national state has been proposed as a Palestinian goal, but the new report signals a marked shift in Palestinian thinking at a time when the latest peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians are yet again struggling to make any headway. Questions are now being asked on both sides about the future of the two-state solution that for so long has been the framework of Middle East peacemaking.</p> <p>The greatest disquiet is on the Palestinian side, where even moderates are now beginning to sense the two-state formula is moving out of reach. </p> <p>\"I feel that a two-state solution is losing currency amongst both our peoples and with the world community beyond,\" said Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister and former World Bank and IMF economist, in a speech he wrote for a meeting of former Israeli diplomats yesterday and which was delivered by Riad Malki, the Palestinian foreign minister. </p> <p>Malki himself admitted that, despite 10 months of talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, which began in Annapolis, in the United States, not a single word of agreement had been put on paper. The Annapolis process, the first such peace talks in seven years, were supposed to produce a peace agreement by the end of this year - a goal that has proved wildly unrealistic.</p> <p>Another group, the Israel-Palestine Centre for Research and Information, published a policy document this week with proposals for the Palestinians to change the status quo. Among the options it said were available were dissolving the Palestinian Authority, calling for a one-state solution and making a Kosovo-style unilateral declaration of independence. </p> <p>However, it noted that the chief risk of calling for a single, bi-national state was that nothing would change and the status quo would simply worsen given how deeply unpopular the idea is among Israelis. \"With so little support from the more powerful neighbour, it seems unlikely that the Palestinian call for unity will bring many positive results in the near term,\" it said. Instead, it concluded: \"We feel that a tightly coordinated non-violent campaign toward statehood is the best option.\"</p> <p>One of the key obstacles on the Palestinian side now is the bitter infighting between the two leading factions, Fatah and Hamas. Since last year, Hamas, the Islamist group that won elections in 2006, has been in full control of Gaza and daily seems to be dividing ever further from its rival Fatah, which effectively controls the West Bank. Even if a peace agreement was reached this year, it is hard to see how it might be implemented in Gaza without reconciliation between the rival factions, and for now that seems out of their grasp. </p> <p>Hamas has long argued against negotiations with Israel. \"We don't see any fruits from the political negotiations,\" Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas advisor said in a recent interview in Gaza. \"So we have to make an evaluation for the whole Palestinian national project. Since Madrid in 1991 until now it's been 17 years but we've seen nothing on the ground. How can I convince people that we are going in the right direction?\"</p> <p>On the Israeli side, opinion is more mixed. In general the two-state solution is still broadly regarded as a reasonable goal, although there are many on the rightwing who say Israel should not give up the land it captured in 1967 or who say Israelis have a Biblical right to settle in the West Bank that cannot be negotiated away.</p> <p>Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister who will step down later this month, has pursued negotiations, arguing that a two-state solution is attainable. On Sunday he will discuss with the cabinet a plan to pay compensation to encourage some of the more distant settlers in the West Bank to move either to Israel or to settlements within the West Bank barrier. </p> <p>Tzipi Livni, the foreign minister who is likely to replace him as head of the ruling Kadima party, also argues in favour of negotiations and has been deeply involved in the latest talks, although she has said she would resist pressure to hurry the negotiations. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, suggested yesterday that some of the Palestinian areas of Jerusalem might become the future capital of a Palestinian state, an idea which has not always been palatable to Israelis. </p> <p>Yet there are others beginning to voice different ideas. In a newspaper column in the Yedioth Ahronoth this week, Giora Eiland, a former head of the National Security Council and former national security adviser under Ariel Sharon, said the gap between Israel and the Palestinians was \"enormous\" and growing. </p> <p>\"The maximum that the Israeli government [any government] will be able to offer the Palestinians [and survive politically] falls short of the minimum that the Palestinian government [any government] can agree to accept [and survive politically],\" he wrote. Eiland argued that a final status peace deal \"will not be achievable in the foreseeable future\" and that new ideas should be considered. He suggested returning control of the West Bank to Jordan, who controlled it before the 1967 war.</p>",
  "<p>What's black and white and full of students? The punchline is ... our database. Funny or not, a campaign by TV Licensing to remind the inhabitants of the 317,000 student rooms on university campuses that they too have to pay the licence fee seems to have been effective. </p> <p>From 2003 TV Licensing (the trade name of the companies contracted to the BBC to collect the charge from owners of sets) used mail shots, online advertisements, trails on the BBC and posters. Their student campaign may help explain an increase in licences of 8% in the first year it ran and 24% in the subsequent year; two years on, 94% of a sample of students recalled the campaign.</p> <p>Each year the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) publishes a study called Advertising Works! The exclamation mark recalls the old adman's adage that half of all advertising budgets are wasted, but nobody knows which half. Creative people tend to exaggerate their impact on the world and advertising, a multibillion industry that conventional economics can't quite explain or justify, is no exception. </p> <p>Yet a body of evidence does exist correlating media campaigns and, say, changes in market share or consumption of certain brands - they are convincing enough for Marks &amp; Spencer, the Halifax and other well known companies to spend hugely. </p> <p><strong><br>Changes in public behaviour</strong></p> <p>The IPA also has a large bank of studies of campaigns carried out on behalf of Whitehall departments and here too there are striking associations between the cost of campaigns and certain changes in public behaviour. Their studies have been mined for a new book*, published with the support of the Central Office of Information (COI). </p> <p>In a foreword, Sir Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary, calls it groundbreaking and for once that large adjective is spot on - though you are left wondering why no one before has tried to evaluate just what central government gets for an advertising spend that comes behind only the soap giants Procter and Gamble and Unilever. (No one knows how much the state, including councils and peripheral bodies, spends in total.) </p> <p>The book lists campaigns to encourage people to pay their taxes on time, to become teachers and Northern Ireland police officers, to lock up their cars, to join the army, and - this one targeted on younger men - not to drink and drive. The signs of their effectiveness are there for all to see.</p> <p><strong>Desired effect</strong></p> <p>Yet Peter Buchanan, the deputy chief executive of the COI, who masterminded the project, makes no heroic claims on behalf of government advertising, welcome though the evidence of its effects is. Himself an adman by background - he worked on the Nestle, BP and Procter &amp; Gamble accounts while at Saatchi and Saatchi - he notes that commercial advertising works by getting people to try a new brand or switch from one brand to another. </p> <p>Giving up smoking or joining the armed forces are by contrast \"life changing\" events - death defying in one case, you might say, and life threatening in the other. You are necessarily dealing here with a different order of message and desired effect.</p> <p>Impact is usually measured first through people's recall of the campaign and then whether they say their behaviour has changed. Ultimately, real changes in behaviour ought to be measurable by road accident statistics or, say, a declining cancer death rate. \"Government advertising,\" says Buchanan, \"is most effective where it goes with the grain of society.\" </p> <p>The book offers case studies and a toolkit rather than models. Sometimes shock tactics work - such as the original Aids awareness advertising 20 years ago. Sometimes, advertising works best if it seems to be offering helpful facts, proffered in a low key way. </p> <p>\"Over the years, I don't think government's capacity to influence behaviour has been reduced.\" But Buchanan, who began his own career back in the mists of time working for British Leyland cars, notes the rules of the road for his colleagues - to ensure their knowledge of people's thinking and doing is up to date, to \"understand where the target audience is\". </p> <p>A government advertising campaign rarely works alone. From 1998 successive campaigns sought to persuade younger graduates to teach, but increases in teacher pay and warm words from ministers about the profession helped. In the book it's claimed the advertising campaign paid for itself 86 times over - but that's based on a complex and hypothetical valuation to do with the cost of paying supply teachers for all the slots actually occupied by the additional teachers recruited, minus those who fell by the wayside before their training and probation was up (a surprising third).</p> <p><strong>Quality of public services</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Morgan and John Poorta of the agencies Lowe Worldwide and Leo Burnett say \"the fact is that advertising has proved a truly efficient form of government investment\", arguing that as well as financial savings campaigns have saved lives and improved the quality of public services by retaining and recruiting staff. </p> <p>And yet pinning down precise causes is hard. These two admit that money spent nationally on advertising smoke alarms could have been given to local fire and rescue services. They say: \"it is clear the campaign was a focusing agent, to get the issue on the agenda of house dwellers nationally so that when local fire brigades [undertook] their own local fire alarm drives, people were more predisposed to listen.\"</p> <p>Buchanan emphasises knowing the audience - remembering, for example, that some 30% of the population, often those the state wants most to reach, are not online or regular users of the web. On the other hand young people, another regular target group for messages, are often sophisticated in their use of media. </p> <p>The COI itself, when giving advice to departments, is media neutral. What Buchanan wants them to do, more than anything, is think hard before they write the briefs that the COI will use in negotiating with advertising agencies: planning and research in advance are critical, both for ministers and policy civil servants. \"Lack of time is the great enemy\" to campaign effectiveness, he concludes.</p> <p><em>* How public service advertising works, World Advertising Research Center, warc.com, \u00a332</em></p>",
  "<p>Mental health professionals who do not involve young people in their treatment are to be \"shamed\" in a new charity campaign.</p> <p>According to children's mental health charity <a href=\" http://www.youngminds.org.uk/\">YoungMinds</a>, 97% of mental health professionals, parents and young people believe children should have a say in their treatment. But despite this, the charity says very few are given a chance to contribute.<br> When professionals overlook young people's opinions and concerns when treating them for a mental illness, they seriously underestimate the individual involved, it says. The charity wants to put pressure on workers to make sure young people are consulted.</p> <p>\"Young people in general are not always listened to and their views are not always taken into consideration in society in general,\" says Sarah Brennan, chief executive of YoungMinds. \"There is something about having a mental health problem that exacerbates that even more and somehow they are not seen as able to make a reasonable judgement, but of course they can.\"</p> <p>Not including a young person in his or her treatment could have a detrimental effect on their health, caused by increased anxiety, refusal to take medications, and distrust of future professionals.</p> <p>She adds that young people are especially affected by the stigma surrounding mental health and should be made to feel comfortable when talking with professionals. </p> <p>The charity, which works with child and adolescent mental health services around the country, wants to launch a national program that will provide training and information, set standards and raise awareness among mental health professionals of the need to include young people in their treatment.</p> <p>Amy Shaw (not her real name), 13, is part of the children's panel Very Important Kids and advises the charity on mental health issues. Shaw has been receiving treatment for the past year and said she still does not really understand why she needs to take the drugs she does or what they do to help.</p> <p>\"It would be great if there was somewhere that told young people more about medications and different treatments,\" Shaw says. \"Even if a child has a disability or a mental health problem it doesn't mean they are dumb and that they don't understand, it just means they may not take it all in at once and may need it explaining to them again.\"</p> <p>David Cottrell, consultant psychiatrist and dean of medicine at the University of Leeds, says the inability to include them marks a failure that should be looked at and changed.</p> <p>\"Sometimes professionals just get it wrong and you have to accept that sometimes happens,\" Cottrell says. \"The treatment of young people with mental health needs has been changing, and for the better, but there is definitely still room for improvement.\"</p> <p>According to Cottrell, a professional not only has to satisfy the needs of the young person receiving the treatment, but must also take into account the desires of their parents, which are often different and hard to reconcile. </p> <p>\"Many of the young people are in conflict with the adults in their lives and can't agree on the same form of treatment,\" Cottrell says. \"Professionals can try and facilitate discussion between them to understand different points of view, but ultimately, it's the parents who have the final decision.\"</p> <p>YoungMinds says that while there is a lot of good practice being carried out, the new campaign would raise awareness about the importance of talking all young people through their treatment, from start to finish. </p> <p>\"If young people understand what's happening they are much more likely to feel a sense of control over their treatment and it can help their success considerably,\" Brennan says. \"If they understand what is going to happen and the consequences of not doing it, they are far more likely to follow the care pathway.\"</p> <p>Shaw says a child of any age or ability should be able to decide on their treatment if they are able to understand the seriousness of a condition they may have. </p> <p>\"I think it is very unfair to put a young person in a position where you are choosing their life steps because you think they are incapable,\" Shaw says. \"If most doctors had the patience to sit and listen for a little longer, they would realise that they are underestimating these children.\"</p>",

  "<p>The UK's state universities may lose out on students and cash as the number of private colleges grows, a study has warned.</p> <p>Universities UK (UUK), the umbrella group for vice-chancellors, today urged universities in this country and across western Europe to be aware of the increased competition they face from the private sector.</p> <p>In its report - Private universities and public funding: models and business plans - UUK warns that American companies which run for-profit companies, such as Kaplan Inc or Apollo, are looking to develop their businesses in the UK and in western Europe. In some cases these firms buy state colleges, in others they work with them.</p> <p>Their tutors tend to concentrate on teaching undergraduates, rather than carrying out research or supervising PhDs.</p> <p>Private colleges often charge more, but, because they are small, have more tutors for every student. Many have religious affiliations.</p> <p>These for-profit companies will try to compete with state universities on price and on courses, the author of the report, Roger King, visiting professor of the Centre for Higher Education Research and Information at the Open University, argues.</p> <p>He believes western Europe is the only part of the world where state universities remain relatively unchallenged by private universities.</p> <p>How state universities will cope depends on how governments in the UK and western Europe respond to the growth of private universities, King argues.</p> <p>\"With increasing curbs on public expenditure around the world and the rise of student fees and debt, we may expect private higher education, not least the for-profit variety to continue to expand,\" he said.</p> <p>Kaplan is \"hoovering up institutions in the UK and Australia\", King warns.

  "<p><strong>10.45am</strong> A delayed start at The Riverside, and I'm not entirely sure why, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. Well, the outfield is too wet, according to the umpires, who've scheduled another inspection for 11.15am - but you can't help feeling if the groundstaff had had the blotter working an hour earlier ..... in fairness, I don't know for sure what time they got here this morning, but I'm told operations didn't begin before 8.30am, and if so, it clearly wasn't early enough. It's dry and sunny, but it won't be later today, according to the forecast. Maybe that's the problem - everyone knows there won't be too much play over the next three days, so they're not over-extending themselves for the sake of half an hour this morning. Anyway, an 11.30am start is my optimistic guess.</p> <p><strong>11am</strong> Scarborough - another prompt start here, for which we're all grateful considering the weather all over the country, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. Sussex are clearly determined to capitalise before the rain reaches this corner of the east coast, and have moved quickly to 226 for four, wicket-keeper Andrew Hodd now within 19 of a second championship century.</p> <p>Yorkshire have opened their attack with Deon Kruis and Adil Rashid, rather than giving the ball straight to Tim Bresnan after his arrival from Cardiff late last night. It's a big day for them off the field as they hope to be given planning permission by Leeds City Council for a new pavilion at Headingley in a meeting this afternoon, while they have also announced ticket prices for next year's Ashes Test. These sound pretty steep, starting at \u00a345 for members and \u00a350 for non-members in the family stand, but not compared to Edgbaston where, according to Yorkshire's chief executive Stewart Regan, the cheapest available seat is \u00a375.</p> <p>Quick update, Hodd has gone, lbw to a ball from Rashid that straightened significantly, leaving Sussex on 227 for five.</p> <p><strong>11.25am</strong> Optimistic was the word. Early lunch (at 12) here at The Riverside, with a view to starting at 12.45pm. It is of course beginning to cloud over. A warm, sunny morning has been entirely wasted. Hey ho.</p> <p><strong>11.40am</strong> You'll never guess what, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Canterbury</em>. It's been raining. Kent and Surrey will take an early lunch at 12.15pm and hope to start at 12.55pm, but the showers are intermittent and I'm not especially optimistic.</p> <p>Surrey fans, meanwhile, may be interested to know that the club has not given up hope of signing Shoaib Akhtar, despite the visa difficulties that prevented him from entering the country in time for this match. They have three games left, including this one, to avoid relegation (they are currently 18 points adrift of Yorkshire at the bottom of the table and 20 behind seventh-placed Lancashire), and the word is that Surrey are crossing their fingers Shoaib can make it for the crucial home games against Hampshire and Nottinghamshire.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm</strong> Scarborough - that placid start was deceptive, as Hodd's departure triggered a clatter of wickets which saw Sussex all out for 265, and Yorkshire now four for one. But the one isn't Michael Vaughan - he's just allowed the first four balls he faced from Sussex debutant Mohammad Sami to pass outside his off stump. Andrew Gale is the man out, lbw playing all around a full swinging delivery from veteran left-armer Jason Lewry. Good news for the Adil Rashid fan club, as he took three of the last six Sussex wickets to end with four for 56, on the ground where he made such a stunning impact two years ago.</p> <p><strong>12.20pm</strong> Scarborough - Vaughan update. He left a fifth ball, again from Sami, then drove his sixth, a straighter half-volley, handsomely through mid-off for four. But four balls later he should have been out, driving loosely at an outswinger and edging high to third slip's left. But Mike Yardy put him down. Could this be Vaughan's day? Yorkshire now 10 for one, by the way.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> Graeme Swann joined Nottinghamshire's side a day late for their top-of-the-table championship match against Somerset after the end of England's one-day series, <em>writes David Hopps at Trent Bridge</em>. His chances of getting a bowl this morning did not seem too good when Somerset resumed at 143-7 - but so spirited was their resistance that he had to intervene to prevent a calamitous Notts morning session.</p> <p>Somerset finished on 252, adding another 109 in 26 overs, with Peter Trego supplying a forceful 86 from 108 balls, an innings full of boisterous sallies off the back foot. The Notts seamers, who had been so dominant on the opening day, were brusquely repelled, leaving Swann to join the attack with Somerset 232-8 and Trego 82 not out.</p> <p>Swann did not play a game in England's one-day series - his county teammate Samit Patel was preferred - so he could have been forgiven for feeling a little rusty. But his intervention soon ended Trego's assault as a legside clout was intercepted at deep midwicket by Mark Wagh, a fine running catch. Trego's ninth-wicket stand with Andrew Caddick was worth 90. The match could not be more finely balanced, but it needs to develop quickly today with heavy rain forecast for tomorrow's third day.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Bah, <em>writes Lawrence Booth at Canterbury</em>. It's raining once more and we are yet to see a bowl balled. Surrey have now failed to get on the pitch for four-and-a-bit successive days of championship cricket following their washout at Blackpool last week, and a quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/radar/\">Met Office rain radar</a> does not make comforting viewing.</p> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> Michael Vaughan's Scarborough misery continues as the third innings of his comeback ends in another failure, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>.</p> <p>The former England captain made 19, his highest score since he took a holiday following his emotional resignation, although that was thanks to being dropped by Sussex's Mike Yardy off his 10th ball.</p> <p>There were a couple of elegant off-side boundaries and one good flick off his legs, all off Mohammad Sami, the Pakistan paceman making his debut for Sussex.</p> <p>But after enjoying the unusual sensation of being not out at lunch, he only lasted another four balls after the interval as, facing Sussex's wily left-arm seamer Jason Lewry for the first time, he dealt with three deliveries swinging back into him before following one that was cleverly slanted away, edging a catch to wicket-keeper Andrew Hodd.</p> <p>Vaughan made 10 and 0 in Yorkshire's last championship game against Kent at Scarborough last week, and has now managed only 196 runs from eight championship innings this season at an average of just over 20.</p> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> Just to rub Vaughan's nose in it, rain has now stopped play, 15 minutes after his dismissal. Yorkshire 35 for two.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> Scarborough - it's stopped raining, the umps have inspected once, but it rained pretty hard, so they're having tea at 2.40pm then looking again at 3pm. The skies look a little ominous.</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong> Play has been called off for the day at Canterbury, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, which will do little to aid Surrey in their bid to avoid their worst season since 1855. According to a diligent colleague of mine in the press box, that year was the last time Surrey failed to win at least three games in a county season. So far in 2008 their tally of victories is a big fat zero, which means they need to win here, then overcome Hampshire and Nottinghamshire at The Oval to avoid accusations of a 153-year nadir. With more bad weather forecast tomorrow, I suspect their goose is already cooked.</p> <p><strong>3.25pm</strong> Good though it is to be watching any cricket all, the 40 overs played in the afternoon session at The Riverside have not been riveting, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. The bald figures are that Durham have scored 100-0 in that time (taking their score to 242-3), and are clearly intent on accumulating what bonus points they can before the weather closes in again.</p> <p>Will Smith has gone on to his century, off 217 balls, and Dale Benkenstein to his 50, off 137. Smith has become Durham's top runscorer of the season in the process, though that isn't saying too much (he's now got 744). Lancashire haven't bowled badly, but there has been a wearying sameness about their attack - Cork, Chapple, Smith, Newby and Croft are all much of a muchness in terms of pace. The first over of the innings that wasn't bowled by a seamer was the 68th, when Stuart Law invited Francois Du Plessis to throw up a few leg-spinners. He immediately turned the ball, one a long way, and Law must be regretting his decision not to include Gary Keedy. Though again, given Keedy's record this season, he didn't have that much to lose. Lancs look very flat.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Scarborough - wireless connection has returned to the press box here just in time for the resumption of play, <em>writes Andy Wilson</em>. Could be a sticky old session for Yorkshire, given the amount of rain that has fallen.</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Just thought I'd add a couple of snippets before signing off, <em>writes Lawrence Booth in Canterbury</em>, where the entire square is covered and the rain continues to fall. It seems that the visa Shoaib Akhtar used to try to get into the country yesterday was the same one that had allowed him a safe passage through customs during his stint with Durham in 2004. Obviously the representatives of Her Majesty at Heathrow, where the Surrey leg-spinner Chris Schofield was sent to collect Shoaib yesterday, have a stricter outlook on life these days.</p> <p>The decision to send Shoaib straight back to Pakistan has left Surrey in an awkward position for a game they must win, since the overseas pro he was going to replace - Australia's Matt Nicholson - had already signed off during Tuesday night's Pro40 defeat against Kent at The Oval. \"He could have played in this match,\" said the Surrey coach Alan Butcher, \"but he's flying home in a few days' time and he probably wouldn't have been in the right frame of mind. There's still an outside chance Shoaib could be available for our last two matches.\"</p> <p>Kent supporters, meanwhile, will be relieved to learn that their South African coach Graham Ford looks like he's staying put rather than taking up the New Zealand job. \"I'm very happy with the set-up here at Kent,\" he told the Kent Messenger. \"I'm working with a fantastic cricket management team and captain and those relationships have developed well and are going nicely. Certainly I have no firm feelings at this point of wanting to head off in any other direction.\"</p> <p><strong>4.45pm</strong> The great thing about all this rain is it gives you an opportunity to get your county records bang up to date, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. And, now that has been attended to, and the coloured pencils have been put back in their box, we even have a little bonus at Trent Bridge: 18 more overs beginning at 5pm. An awful lot will have to happen to get this game back on track. Nottinghamshire resume on 3-0, 249 behind.</p> <p><strong>6.20pm</strong> Notts' experimental opening pair, Will Jefferson and Bilal Shafayat, might have been designed as an optical illusion rather than an answer to their batting problems at the top of the order, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Jefferson, at nearly 6ft 10ins, is the tallest county cricketer in the land, whereas Shafayat, if he stands on tiptoe, just about musters 5ft 7ins. Stare at them long enough as they stand 22 yards away from each other and eventually you imagine that the Trent Bridge pitch is steeply sloping.</p> <p>They put on 157 against Sussex at Hove last week, but the new alliance might yet fall foul of Health &amp; Safety because if they ever try to punch gloves there is the danger that Shafayat will be left with a bloody nose and Jefferson will collapse to the crease clutching his groin.</p> <p>There were few excuses for glove punching on this occasion. A cautious opening stand ended on 40 - immediately after Somerset got the ball changed - when Jefferson edged Charl Willoughby to the wicketkeeper. Andre Adams was sent in as nightwatchman, but he is not really cut out for such responsibilities and he carved to gully in the same over. Notts completed an awkward 18 overs in milky evening sunshine on 46-2. They trail Somerset by 206.</p> <p>Shafayat was almost dismissed on three when he drove Andrew Caddick to short extra where Max Waller's claim for a catch, supported by his teammates, was not upheld by the umpire Patsy Harris. Both Harris and his fellow official, Tim Robinson, are former Notts players. It says a lot about cricket's deep well of goodwill that nobody is the slightest bit concerned at such things.</p>",
  "<p>An investigation has been launched after a police firearms specialist left a loaded gun in a Starbucks cafe in central London.</p> <p>The officer, who has reportedly provided personal protection for the former prime minister Tony Blair, left the pistol in the toilets after she visited the coffee shop last week. The gun was found by a member of the public.</p> <p>\"The weapon belongs to an MPS [Metropolitan Police Service]-authorised firearms officer who was on duty at the time. An investigation has begun,'' the Metropolitan police said.</p> <p>The majority of British officers do not carry guns, aside from specialist officers whose duties include guarding dignitaries or responding to armed incidents.</p> <p>According to a report in today's Sun, the officer was a woman in her 30s whose job was to protect the former prime minister. </p> <p>She had left the semi-automatic Glock 17 gun in the toilets of the cafe after taking off her belt. She later bought a coffee, not realising she had left the weapon behind. Reports this morning suggested it was left on the floor of the cafe's toilets for 20 minutes.</p> <p>An investigation is being carried out by Scotland Yard's directorate of professional standards. It is understood the officer has been relieved of her duties while the investigation is under way.</p>",
  "<p>A snail could crawl the entire length of the Great Wall of China in 212 years, just slightly longer than the 200 years it will take for women to be equally represented in parliament. That's the depressing conclusion of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7596319.stm\">the latest report into women's representation in positions of power</a>. </p> <p>Meanwhile Hurricane Sarah is sweeping the US. Sarah Palin's great appeal is her apparent ordinariness (just your average moose-hunting mom), although by definition she is extraordinary. I disagree with virtually all of her policy positions - but it's exciting she's there at all. </p> <p>Palin plays up her hockey mom image, from her soldier son and pregnant daughter to her special needs baby. But equally significant is her background in that very male world of Alaska gas and oil. When Palin calls for energy independence for the US, she is talking about increasing supply, including new drilling in Alaska. </p> <p>Sarah Palin and I were both born in 1964; I'm sure that like me she was enthralled by seeing the Apollo missions to the moon. The great challenge now for our generation is not to find new planets but to save the one we've got. That's why <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/news/http-www-libdems-org-uk-news-clegg-calls-for-apollo-project-to-secure-uks-energy-independence.14971.html\">Nick Clegg is calling for a new Apollo project for British energy independence</a>, based on massive investment in renewables, combined with reduced consumption. </p> <p>How the US develops its energy policy will determine the world's ability to fight climate change. Let's not get too excited about Hurricane Sarah.</p> <p><strong>In Islington, stamp duty is the least of our worries</strong></p> <p>Islington is back to school in the rain, and it's not just the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7513843.stm\">weather</a> that's getting people down. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/03/unemploymentdata.economics\">Consumer confidence is at an all-time low</a>, the Bank of England is warning of further downturns, and the OECD says Britain is leading the way into recession. </p> <p>With all this going on, the government's temporary tweaking of stamp duty seems irrelevant. Here in Islington, house prices start at \u00a3200k, so changing the threshold below that is meaningless. Across the country, relatively few buyers will benefit, and only for a year, at a cost to the Treasury of \u00a3600m. It's a policy made with eyes on headlines, not the bottom line \u2013 and failing on both. </p> <p>Liberal Democrats want to see more banding of stamp duty relative to house prices, plus the scrapping of stamp duty on all carbon neutral homes. Labour have already cut and pasted Vince Cable's ideas on reducing repossessions, so why not on stamp duty too?</p> <p>I'd advocate switching stamp duty from purchaser to vendor as well. That would free first-time buyers from stamp duty, and could actually console vendors for falling house prices. </p> <p>Meanwhile for some of the people I've been helping this week, stamp duty is the least of their worries. </p> <p>Mehmet has been living in Islington for six years. He works long hours running his small business, a local cafe, and is a positive part of our community. He is sharing his council bedsit with his wife and baby son, and like thousands of others, is on the waiting list for a larger flat. </p> <p>Grace is the widow and mother of British citizens, but not British herself; she came to Islington when her husband died, to live with her son. Apart from a tiny widow's pension - less than minimum benefit levels - she gets no state aid. Her son is already doing two jobs, and Grace is looking for paid work too; even so, they're afraid they are going to lose their home. </p> <p>Then there's Amy, a young woman who left a difficult home to live with her sister. Leaving an overcrowded home was good news, but her <a href=\"http://ema.direct.gov.uk/\">EMA</a> was not enough to pay her share of the bills, so Amy has quit college for a series of temporary, minimum wage jobs, without much hope for her future. </p> <p>These are all \"hard-working families\", Islington-style, the very people the Labour government claimed it wanted to help. They are not failures. But the system has failed them.</p>",

The Ipsos-Mori poll, conducted in July and August, shows that more than 58% of men and women support making it illegal to pay for sex if it will help reduce the number of women and children being trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation.</p> <p>A Home Office-led review into the demand for prostitution, due to report this year, is looking at whether ministers should make it illegal to pay for sex. The review is looking at how to curb demand, but the Home Office minister Vernon Coaker has given a broad hint he will back criminalising the purchase of sex if there is a sign of a national consensus on the issue.</p> <p>The findings of the government-commissioned survey are likely to give ministers greater confidence in introducing the measure. At present the law makes it illegal to sell sex, but ministers including Coaker have visited Sweden to see if tougher laws, including banning the purchase of sex, can work.</p> <p>Harman has the backing of prominent ministers including the solicitor general, Vera Baird, and the attorney general, Lady Scotland.</p> <p>Harman said some people in the survey had double standards, indicating that they were relaxed about the principle of paying for sex but would be deeply ashamed if a female relative was working as a prostitute.</p> <p>The research found divergent attitudes between women and men. A clear majority of women found both paying for sex and selling it unacceptable (61% and 65% respectively), but men were much more equivocal, with just 42% and 40% respectively finding it unacceptable.</p> <p>More than half of those questioned (60%) from both genders would feel ashamed if they found out a family member was working as a prostitute. But men were more likely to find it unacceptable for a female relative to sell sex, while being relaxed about a male relative paying for it.</p> <p>This difference was most stark among men over 55, who were the most accepting of buying sex in general, but just 21% of whom thought it acceptable for a female relative to sell sex.</p> <p>Young people were more likely than older people to find paying for sex and selling sex unacceptable (64% and 69% respectively).</p> <p>Harman said: \"Our survey suggests that there are double standards out there: the overwhelming majority of those people who said they thought selling sex was a reasonable choice also said they would find it unacceptable if a family member was working as a prostitute.</p> <p>\"We know that paying for sex fuels the demand for trafficked women and children, but we can't talk about tackling demand without challenging cultural attitudes more widely.\"</p> <p>Harman has been allowed to express her personal view that buying sex should be made illegal before the government review has been completed.</p> <p>The Poppy Project survey found 77 different ethnicities of women were being offered for sex, many from trafficking hotspots such as eastern Europe and south-east Asia.</p> <p>Co-author Helen Atkins said: \"This research shows the disturbing prevalence of the sex industry in every corner of London - fuelled by the demand for prostitution services.</p> <p>\"Multi-media misrepresentations of commercial sex as a glamorous, easy and fun career choice for girls and women further contribute to the ubiquity of London's brothel industry.\"</p> <p>A researcher said in the report: \"There was a chain of south-east London places which promised 'the lowest prices in London' and a place in Islington stood out as sounding particularly unpleasant and dodgy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Parents should not circumcise a son on the grounds of faith without the child's consent, a conference will hear today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.norm-uk.co.uk/\">Norm-UK</a>, a charity opposed to male circumcision, said the practice was harmful and subjected children to surgery that was non-consensual, irreversible and unnecessary.</p> <p>It meets today at a Keele University conference addressing the issues of male and female circumcision, in addition to examining the physical and psychological impact of these practices.</p> <p>Laura MacDonald, a trustee of Norm-UK, said: \"We are not calling for a ban on Jewish or Muslim parents circumcising their sons, but we're asking them to reconsider and wait until the child is old enough to give his consent.</p> <p>\"If it is a religious requirement then it has more value if carried out when someone has chosen to do it. It is unlawful for anyone under the age of 18 to be given a tattoo even if they want it. There's an anomaly here.\"</p> <p>In Judaism, the Brit Mila - ritual circumcision - is one of the cornerstones of the faith and is held on the eighth day after the child is born. </p> <p>Circumcision is seen as a religious obligation, not a medical operation, and is carried out by a mohel, someone who has been trained in the procedure and understands the significance of the rite. The Initiation Society, formed in 1745, trains men to perform this ritual and more than 2,000 circumcisions are done every year.</p> <p>In Islam, circumcision is not mentioned in the Qur'an but its practice, highly recommended by scholars, is widespread in most communities. The preferred age is often seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as the seventh day after birth and as late as puberty.</p> <p>Norm-UK will be working with health visitors and midwives to raise awareness and there will also be events and leaflets aimed at educating parents.</p> <p>MacDonald said the charity would work with a range of bodies to gauge their views on the subject.</p> <p>Rabbi Danny Rich, the chief executive of Liberal Judaism, said the movement considered ethical requirements to be of a higher order than the value of ritual practice.</p> <p>\"Circumcision is an ancient Jewish rite and the majority of our families still support and practise it. Circumcision does not accord Jewish status in even the most traditional interpretations of who is a Jew and thus an uncircumcised Jewish child would be treated exactly the same as a circumcised one in our communities.\"</p> <p>Mark Harris, from the Board of Deputies, said parents were free to do as they wished although most chose to adhere to Jewish law and tradition.</p> <p>\"The debate about whether circumcision is medically beneficial is therefore of less relevance to Jewish parents than cultural and religious considerations,\" he said.</p> <p>The NHS does not fund ritual circumcisions, however in areas where there is a significant Muslim population - such as Sandwell and Leeds - it is carried out for a fee. </p> <p>According to the Department of Health, the operation is carried out on babies aged between six and 12 weeks old and the child must be registered with a GP in that area. In some instances the service is provided where private surgery has resulted in complications.</p>",

  "<p>As a piece of derring-do it is hard to fault the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/afghanistan.waveandtidalpower\">delivery of a massive electric turbine</a> to the Kajaki dam in Afghanistan's Helmand province.</p> <p>It was the biggest clearance operation British forces had mounted since the second world war, and a welcome piece of good news after the unrelentingly worst few weeks since the ousting of the Taliban. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7593901.stm\">Gordon Brown stated</a>: \"It is yet another example of the skill and courage of our forces, but also a reminder of the fundamental purpose of why they are there \u2013 the long-term development of Afghanistan, giving the people a stake in the future.\"</p> <p>Well, up to a point, yes. The operation was only made possible by the discovery of a mountain pass, which enabled the convoy to bypass Helmand's notorious 611 Highway where it would have been a sitting duck for Taliban missiles. As Lieutenant Colonel Huw Williams, the commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, said, \"If we had brought it up the 611, the level of destruction we would have had to cause would not have been worth it. Our pathfinder platoon found this route, and that's really what made it possible.\"</p> <p>British troops were deployed to make the Taliban think that the delivery would be made along the 611 and the existence of the mountain pass was subject to a media blackout. This was accompanied by a massive military onslaught on the Taliban's fixed positions using airstrikes, artillery and ground assaults. </p> <p>The convoy set out a week ago, on Tuesday, arriving at Kajaki on Monday night. On Saturday, the British army offered the Taliban near Kajaki $25,000 to ensure their safe passage using local elders as go-betweens. It is an open secret that such bribes are often made at the local level. In this case, it was justified as a \"hearts and minds\" operation to \"compensate\" the community for the closure of their bazaar for a week. </p> <p>\"We knew they were talking to the Taliban, but our deal was with the local elders,\" said Captain Steve Boardman, who led the negotiations. The elders agreed, on the understanding the Paras would not search their compounds, nor stray more than 300m from the road. The Taliban were observed dismantling some of their roadside bombs along the route, but the following day the deal broke down. \"We took them the papers to sign and no one turned up,\" <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/world/Mission-impossible--Not-for.4451331.jp\">Capt Boardman said</a>. \"I think the local Taliban agreed, but their highers in Pakistan said no.\"</p> <p>In the event, the convoy pushed through using military force and the Taliban suffered substantial losses, but, apart from the propaganda victory, it is difficult to see what has been achieved. </p> <p>The US began the hydroelectric project 60 years ago with the damming of the upper Helmand River. In 1975, they installed two 16.5 megawatt turbines, intending to also install a third turbine. The project <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/03/2353781.htm\">was put on hold</a> following the Communists' seizure of power and the Russian invasion, and the plant fell into disrepair during the conflict that followed.</p> <p>The US revived it following the ousting of the Taliban, but very little progress has been made since 2001, despite millions of dollars being poured into the project. The power station has come to be seen as a source of huge embarrassment for US officials, who put pressure on their British counterparts to facilitate the turbine's delivery.</p> <p>The logistics of the operation were undeniably impressive and the cooperation between various international military forces was also encouraging. The turbine itself is Chinese-made and Chinese engineers already on the ground will install the equipment. However, while the delivery transforms the power plant from an embarrassing white elephant into a potentially viable project, this only one marks one more step towards its completion \u2013 which will take at least another two years. </p> <p>Although the plant has the potential to supply most of southern Afghanistan with electricity, there is no electricity grid in an area that is effectively under Taliban control. The power station itself is a sitting target for Taliban attacks, which now appear more likely due to the prestige that has been invested in the project. </p> <p>It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that this delivery will be of more benefit to certain politicians than the Afghan people themselves.</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans are hitting back against not only the Democrats but also against what they see as unfair treatment by the media. The folks at non-partisan FactCheck.org haven't got around to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking\">Fisking</a> the speech by Rudy Guiliani or vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, but the Republicans are showing their usual discipline on hammering home talking points. FactCheck has reviewed the speeches of Democrat turned independent Senator Joseph Lieberman and former presidential candidate and Republican Senator Fred Thompson. <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/gop_convention_spin.html\">FactCheck found</a>:</p> <p>\u2022 Lieberman said Obama hadn't \"reached across party lines\" to accomplish \"anything significant,\" though Obama has teamed with GOP Sens. Tom Coburn and Richard Lugar to pass laws enhancing government transparency and curtailing the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons. <br>\u2022 Thompson repeated misleading claims about Obama's tax program, saying it would bring \"one of the largest tax increases in American history.\" But as increases go, Obama's package is hardly a history-maker. It would raise taxes for families with incomes above $250,000. Most people would see a cut.<br>\u2022 Lieberman also accused Obama of \"voting to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield.\" But Obama's only vote against a war-funding bill came after Bush vetoed a version of the bill Obama had supported - and McCain urged the veto.</p> <p>The Republicans always hammer the Democrats on taxes, even if <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/a_new_stitch_in_a_bad_pattern.html\">many of their attacks run foul of the facts</a>. FactCheck documents their reports with links off to original reporting or source material such as John McCain press releases.

  "<p>Dateline: Dullsville. Day Three of the GOP convention, which feels like it's already lasted half my lifetime. Tonight is <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/politics/state/27810774.html\">Sarah Palin's Big Speech</a>, so it's All Palin All the Time among the talking heads in America's Cable News Land. </p> <p>Scenes from the class struggle in St Paul:</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Matthews on MSNBC is threatening everyone he sees with Lexis-Nexus searches to uncover whether people who are now gushing enthusiastically about Palin ever even mentioned her name before tonight. It's classic Matthews \u2013 bullying, slightly unstable, and repetitive. But, for a change, he's got a pretty good point.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrea Mitchell says the veep speech was written awhile ago for an unnamed running mate, but, when Palin was chosen, it was de-masculinised \u2013 meaning, I suppose, that the reference to \"balls of solid patriotism\" and the stage direction to \"grab crotch\" for emphasis on the line \"I got your hope and change right here\" were removed.</p> <p>\u2022 Tom Brokaw just told me that a waitress in Nebraska working the 4-12 shift at a fast food restaurant \"with a couple of kids to raise and her husband's left her a couple of years ago\" will look at Sarah Palin with a different perspective than he will. Genius. But what about the poor, hard-working waitress/mother whose husband hasn't left her? Don't leave me hangin', Tom! </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0815/is_1999_March/ai_54753537\">Bob Dole</a> calls Palin a \"mainstream conservative\" (yikes) and says Joe Biden will need to give Palin the respect she's due during the veep debate, \"not because she's a woman, but because of the respect you give people, particularly women.\" It's fun watching the Old Guard GOP try to dress up chivalry and paternalism as feminism. They really should have been paying more attention the last 30 years.</p> <p>Anyhoo\u2026</p> <p>Tonight, there is a lot of chatter about how Palin complements McCain and how she's ready to be \"one heartbeat away\" from the presidency. Keith Olbermann tells us the new talking point on Palin's foreign policy experience (or lack thereof, ahem) is that Alaska's geographical proximity to Russia makes her some kind of expert. Holy Maude, this is getting silly. And of course there's the old \"she's got the good fortune of being on a ticket with John McCain\" canard. I'd really like some enterprising reporter to start asking Republican leaders if, should something require John McCain to abandon the race, they would be comfortable supporting Palin at the top of the ticket. Make them answer yes. I want to hear the absurdity of their saying she's the best person in the nation to represent their party, in McCain's hypothetical absence.</p> <p>There's also lots of chatter about how McCain and Palin are going on the offense against the media. Media elites are big meanies and all that. Yeah, that narrative worked great for Bush in 1992. Run with it, you crazy rebels.</p> <p>Rounding out the trifecta of Things We're Talking About Tonight is the always-fun Vagina Voting. Will Palin appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters? As if on cue, the preposterousness of this possibility is underlined by former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina materializing onstage. She knows John McCain. I know this because she says \"I know John McCain\" about eight thousand times in her boring-ass speech. I'd like to hear less about how she knows John McCain and more about how women are supposed to become CEOs of Fortune 500 corporations if they don't have control over their reproduction.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the convention floor, the Republicans are dancing to the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Footloose-1984-Film-Various-Artists/dp/B00000D9VZ\">Footloose</a> theme. I was just thinking that what this convention needed was <strong>more Kenny Loggins</strong>!</p> <p>Over on Fox, Bill O'Reilly is wrapping up the trainwreck he calls a show by discussing Michael Phelps. Topical. Now we segue into Hannity &amp; Colmes, where the dipstick duo is chatting with Karl Rove. What in grey-templed hell is Fox doing showing this inane interview when Willard \"Mitt\" Romney is speaking?! I switch back to MSNBC, where Willard is being given the attention he's due as he works himself into a lather pretending, like all those before him at the Xcel Center, that the economy tanked in a void. McCain, it turns out, is running against both the Democrats AND the Republicans.</p> <p>Sayeth Willard: \"People in our party prefer Straight Talk to politically correct talk.\" And not just that. People in his party prefer Straight Talk to honest talk, sensible talk, coherent talk, and interesting talk, too. Beat that, Obama!</p> <p>More dancing on the convention floor now as we wait for Mike Huckabee. There's more energy tonight, but the party scene, such as it is, still has the quality of a camping trip with your parents when you're a teenager. It might be a perfectly swell time until you see a bunch of kids from out of state pull up in a VW Bus, parentless and cool and smelling vaguely of weed \u2013 and suddenly you're consciously trying to have observable fun with your parents, just so the kids don't feel sorry for you. Of course, they're not even paying attention, immersed as they are in their authentic, unselfconscious revelry. (And you're not really succeeding, anyway.) It's this pretense, this desperation, that's making this convention unbearable to watch.</p> <p>Huckabee babbles nonsense about school desks. I think it's a bedtime story, because it's putting me to sleep...</p> <p>When I awaken, Rudy Giuliani is taking the stage, and instantly dashes my hopes for a \"Rudy Giuliani Revue!\" by not wearing his fishnets and failing to enter flanked by two erstwhile Rockettes to be introduced as the \"9/11 Dancers.\" There's no such thing as showmanship anymore. Instead, it's just a bunch of snore-inducing codswallop about lefty media and Hollywood liberals and other Americans who should be sent to Gitmo, followed by a careening stagger from random subject to random subject, eliciting cheers and boos and chants of USA! in the vaguely appropriate spots. Hey, here's a hot bit of news for us, care of Giuly: McCain was a POW. Really? Tell me more. (I know you will!) He is, as always, a brutally bad speaker \u2013 they couldn't have done better finding someone who will inevitably make Palin look good. After this, she could come out and play a funeral dirge on a broken kazoo and look like a dynamo.</p> <p>And she's coming right up! Giuliani spoke so long that he has preempted the video bio package on Palin and she is brought onstage instantly.</p> <p>She gets the biggest cheer I've heard so far as she accepts the nomination for the vice presidency. And then she's off to the races \u2013 McCain is a \"profile in courage.\" She's a mother of one of the troops, one of many moms who will say \"an extra prayer each night.\" She introduces the rest of her kids, talks about how her family's got ups and downs, recounts marrying her high school sweetheart, introduces her parents. She tells us that the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull is lipstick. And the difference between a mayor and a community organizer is that a mayor's got actual responsibilities. I'm learning a lot tonight.</p> <p>Whatever tonight's theme was officially, unofficially it's \"Issues Schmissues: Barack's a Doodyhead.\"</p> <p>Now Palin tells us she's not a member of the \"Washington elite.\" There's almost no better evidence that someone's a member of the Washington elite than use of the phrase \"Washington elite.\" People who have no interest in Washington don't have cause to use the term Washington elite. You're in it now, sister.</p> <p>She repeats the lie that she didn't support the Bridge to Nowhere. She embarks on a series of petty one-line jabs against the Dems which culminates in a truly childish dig at Obama's staging in Denver, followed by the assertion that Harry Reid saying he can't stand John McCain is perhaps the best evidence they've chosen the right person. If mocking the opinion of a soggy dishrag like Reid is the best they've got, they're really in trouble.</p> <p>And now comes the POW portion of the speech, which has been so voraciously exploited in every speech at this Maudeforsaken convention that it now rings like hold muzak in my ears.</p> <p>When it's over, Palin's family joins her onstage \u2013 and then so does John McCain. Proof of his rebellious maverickosity: Pulling exactly the same \"surprise\" as Obama did last week. If that doesn't perfectly sum up this sorry display, I don't know what would.</p> <p>Overall, it's safe to say that Palin accomplished what she needed to accomplish tonight; she competently delivered a speech on a national stage, looked like she belonged, and claimed her place there. And she laid out a compelling alternative cultural narrative to Barack Obama's story, at least as the Republicans see it. She's a proud, patriotic, traditional, humble, small-town hockey mom who's American through and through \u2013 the kind of person real Americans can vote for, not like some uppity, unpatriotic, worldly, celebrified, latte-drinking, biracial urban sophisticate who's secretly a radical Muslim cokehead abortionist.</p> <p>The choice is clear, Palin seemed to say.</p> <p>But she also said: \"If character is the measure in this election, and hope the theme, and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause.\" Obama's dictating their message \u2013 and I'm not convinced there will be many takers for the pale imitators who mock his rhetoric, even as they steal it for their own.</p>",

I don't think we had that much enthusiasm, say a month ago, as we do now.\"</p> <p>The delegates welcomed her comments on the news media, which came at the end of a day of coordinated attacks on news outlets by Republican campaign strategists and spokespeople.</p> <p>\"The news media has tried to steer a lot of this election, and has not reported both sides of what's going on,\" said Glennda Cook of Texas. \"It's been very slanted\".</p> <p>Metzger of North Carolina said, \"It is time that we in this country live our lives and govern ourselves irrespective of what the media says. </p> <p>\"The news media do not control this country, should not control this country, and if we ever allow that to happen we're doomed.\"</p> <p>Palin's speech contained few details on Republican economic proposals, but Michael Steele, former lieutenant governor of Maryland, said that was appropriate for an acceptance speech by a vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>\"She's running for vice-president, not president,\" said Steele. \"John McCain sets the bar, sets the stage, sets the pace of this race. Her job is to make sure that's executed and implemented the way the ticket decides it's going to be. I thought she did very well, laying out what that vision is that Senator McCain has for this country, talking about energy, talking about the things that are important to families. And I think that's all you can ask\".</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337286269\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Mr Chairman, delegates and fellow citizens: I am honoured to be considered for the nomination for vice-president of the United States ...</p> <p>I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America. </p> <p>I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election ... against confident opponents ... at a crucial hour for our country. </p> <p>And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions ... and met far graver challenges ... and knows how tough fights are won - the next president of the United States, John S McCain. </p> <p>It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves.</p> <p>With their usual certitude, they told us that all was lost - there was no hope for this candidate who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war. </p> <p>But the pollsters and pundits overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off.</p> <p>They overlooked the caliber of the man himself - the determination, resolve and sheer guts of Senator John McCain. The voters knew better. </p> <p>And maybe that's because they realise there is a time for politics and a time for leadership ... a time to campaign and a time to put our country first. </p> <p>Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage, and people like that are hard to come by.</p> <p>He's a man who wore the uniform of this country for 22 years, and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who have now brought victory within sight. </p> <p>And as the mother of one of those troops, that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander in chief. I'm just one of many moms who'll say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm's way. </p> <p>Our son Track is 19. </p> <p>And one week from tomorrow - September 11th - he'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country. </p> <p>My nephew Kasey also enlisted, and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf.</p> <p>My family is proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform. Track is the eldest of our five children. </p> <p>In our family, it's two boys and three girls in between - my strong and kind-hearted daughters Bristol, Willow and Piper. </p> <p>And in April, my husband Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world, a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig. From the inside, no family ever seems typical.</p> <p>That's how it is with us. </p> <p>Our family has the same ups and downs as any other ... the same challenges and the same joys. </p> <p>Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge.</p> <p>And children with special needs inspire a special love. </p> <p>To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters.</p> <p>I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the White House. Todd is a story all by himself. </p> <p>He's a lifelong commercial fisherman ... a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska's north slope ... a proud member of the United Steel Workers' Union ... and world champion snow machine racer. </p> <p>Throw in his Yup'ik Eskimo ancestry, and it all makes for quite a package. </p> <p>We met in high school, and two decades and five children later he's still my guy. My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town. </p> <p>And among the many things I owe them is one simple lesson: that this is America, and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity. </p> <p>My parents are here tonight, and I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath. Long ago, a young farmer and haberdasher from Missouri followed an unlikely path to the vice-presidency. </p> <p>A writer observed: \"We grow good people in our small towns, with honesty, sincerity and dignity.\" I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman.</p> <p>I grew up with those people. </p> <p>They are the ones who do some of the hardest work in America ... who grow our food, run our factories and fight our wars.</p> <p>They love their country, in good times and bad, and they're always proud of America. I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town. </p> <p>I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids' public education better. </p> <p>When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters, and knew their families, too.</p> <p>Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska, I was mayor of my hometown.</p> <p>And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves. </p> <p>I guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a \"community organizer,\" except that you have actual responsibilities. I might add that in small towns, we don't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they are listening, and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people aren't listening.</p> <p>We tend to prefer candidates who don't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco. </p> <p>As for my running mate, you can be certain that wherever he goes, and whoever is listening, John McCain is the same man. I'm not a member of the permanent political establishment.</p> <p>And I've learned quickly, these past few days, that if you're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite, then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone. </p> <p>But here's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators: I'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion - I'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country. Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reasons, and not just to mingle with the right people.</p> <p>Politics isn't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests. </p> <p>The right reason is to challenge the status quo, to serve the common good, and to leave this nation better than we found it.</p> <p>No one expects us to agree on everything.</p> <p>But we are expected to govern with integrity, good will, clear convictions and ... a servant's heart. </p> <p>I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States. This was the spirit that brought me to the governor's office, when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau ... when I stood up to the special interests, the lobbyists, big oil companies, and the good-ol' boys network.</p> <p>Sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power brokers. That's why true reform is so hard to achieve. </p> <p>But with the support of the citizens of Alaska, we shook things up.</p> <p>And in short order we put the government of our state back on the side of the people.</p> <p>I came to office promising major ethics reform, to end the culture of self-dealing. And today, that ethics reform is the law. </p> <p>While I was at it, I got rid of a few things in the governor's office that I didn't believe our citizens should have to pay for.</p> <p>That luxury jet was over the top. I put it on eBay. </p> <p>I also drive myself to work.</p> <p>And I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef - although I've got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her. I came to office promising to control spending - by request if possible and by veto if necessary. </p> <p>Senator McCain also promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest - and as a chief executive, I can assure you it works.</p> <p>Our state budget is under control.</p> <p>We have a surplus.</p> <p>And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending: nearly half a billion dollars in vetoes. </p> <p>I suspended the state fuel tax, and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress.</p> <p>I told the Congress \"thanks, but no thanks,\" for that bridge to nowhere.</p> <p>If our state wanted a bridge, we'd build it ourselves. When oil and gas prices went up dramatically, and filled up the state treasury, I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged - directly to the people of Alaska. </p> <p>And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, who kind of liked things the way they were, we broke their monopoly on power and resources.</p> <p>As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people.</p> <p>I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. </p> <p>And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40bn natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence.</p> <p>That pipeline, when the last section is laid and its valves are opened, will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart. </p> <p>The stakes for our nation could not be higher.</p> <p>When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico, this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we are forced to draw from our strategic petroleum reserve.</p> <p>And families cannot throw away more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil. </p> <p>With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus, and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon, we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers.</p> <p>To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of world energy supplies ... or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia ... or that Venezuela might shut off its oil deliveries ... we Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas. </p> <p>And take it from a gal who knows the north slope of Alaska: we've got lots of both.</p> <p>Our opponents say, again and again, that drilling will not solve all of America's energy problems - as if we all didn't know that already.</p> <p>But the fact that drilling won't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all. </p> <p>Starting in January, in a McCain-Palin administration, we're going to lay more pipelines build more nuclear plants create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar, wind, geothermal and other alternative sources.</p> <p>We need American energy resources, brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers. I've noticed a pattern with our opponent.</p> <p>Maybe you have, too.</p> <p>We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. </p> <p>And there is much to like and admire about our opponent.</p> <p>But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. </p> <p>This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word \"victory\" except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed ... when the roar of the crowd fades away ... when the stadium lights go out, and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan? What does he actually seek to accomplish, after he's done turning back the waters and healing the planet? The answer is to make government bigger ... take more of your money ... give you more orders from Washington ... and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world. America needs more energy ... our opponent is against producing it. </p> <p>Victory in Iraq is finally in sight ... he wants to forfeit.</p> <p>Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ... he wants to meet them without preconditions.</p> <p>Al Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ... he's worried that someone won't read them their rights? Government is too big ... he wants to grow it.</p> <p>Congress spends too much ... he promises more. </p> <p>Taxes are too high ... he wants to raise them. His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan, and let me be specific.</p> <p>The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes ... raise payroll taxes ... raise investment income taxes ... raise the death tax ... raise business taxes ... and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars. My sister Heather and her husband have just built a service station that's now opened for business - like millions of others who run small businesses. </p> <p>How are they going to be any better off if taxes go up? Or maybe you're trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or Ohio ... or create jobs with clean coal from Pennsylvania or West Virginia ... or keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota.</p> <p>How are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy? Here's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election.</p> <p>In politics, there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers. </p> <p>And then there are those, like John McCain, who use their careers to promote change.</p> <p>They're the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms, not just on buttons and banners, or on self-designed presidential seals. </p> <p>Among politicians, there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things. </p> <p>And then there is the idealism of those leaders, like John McCain, who actually do great things. They're the ones who are good for more than talk ... the ones we have always been able to count on to serve and defend America. Senator McCain's record of actual achievement and reform helps explain why so many special interests, lobbyists and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency - from the primary election of 2000 to this very day. </p> <p>Our nominee doesn't run with the Washington herd.</p> <p>He's a man who's there to serve his country, and not just his party. </p> <p>A leader who's not looking for a fight, but is not afraid of one either. Harry Reid, the majority leader of the current do-nothing Senate, not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee. </p> <p>He said, quote, \"I can't stand John McCain\". Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we've chosen the right man. Clearly what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain. That is only one more reason to take the maverick of the Senate and put him in the White House. My fellow citizens, the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of \"personal discovery.\" This world of threats and dangers is not just a community, and it doesn't just need an organizer. </p> <p>And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, \"fighting for you,\" let us face the matter squarely. </p> <p>There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you ... in places where winning means survival and defeat means death ... and that man is John McCain. In our day, politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world in which this man, and others equally brave, served and suffered for their country. </p> <p>It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office.</p> <p>But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made. </p> <p>It's the journey of an upright and honourable man - the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this country, only he was among those who came home. </p> <p>To the most powerful office on earth, he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless ... the wisdom that comes even to the captives, by the grace of God ... the special confidence of those who have seen evil, and seen how evil is overcome. A fellow prisoner of war, a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster, Ohio, recalls looking through a pin-hole in his cell door as lieutenant commander John McCain was led down the hallway, by the guards, day after day.</p> <p>As the story is told, \"When McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations, he would turn toward Moe's door and flash a grin and thumbs up\" - as if to say, \"We're going to pull through this\". My fellow Americans, that is the kind of man America needs to see us through these next four years. </p> <p>For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words.</p> <p>For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds.</p> <p>If character is the measure in this election ... and hope the theme ... and change the goal we share, then I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States.</p> <p>Thank you all, and may God bless America.</p>",

We're in for a night of liberal-bashing speeches from a trio of presidential failures, and then the big event of the evening, Sarah Palin's keynote speech, which will be received with adulation in the hall even if she reads from a telephone directory \u2014 but the content of which may count for a lot in the country at large.</p> <p><strong>8.07pm</strong>: Romney is railing against \"the eastern elites... the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and the broadcasters from the east coast.\" Instead he advocates looking west... to Alaska. Northwest, surely?</p> <p><strong>8.09pm (all times local)</strong>: \"Is a Supreme Court liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal! Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? \u2014 It's liberal!... We need change all right - change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington!\" We've got a whole call-and-response thing going on now.</p> <p><strong>8.14pm</strong>: \"China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids.\"</p> <p><strong>8.18pm</strong>: \"I know what makes jobs come, and I know what makes them go.\" What made jobs come and go often enough in the past, as Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=public_equity_and_you\">points out</a>, has been the noted private equity firm chief executive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney#Business_career\">Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.19pm</strong>: \"Just like you, there has never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We inherited the greatest nation in the history of the earth.\" Many muscular chants of \"USA! USA!\". Take that, Michelle Obama.</p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: And now they're all clapping and dancing to a song called <a href=\"http://www.songlyrics.com/song-lyrics/Rodney_Atkins/Miscellaneous/If_You_re_Going_Through_Hell_(Before_The_Devil_Even_Knows)/255674.html\">If You're Going Through Hell,</a> which seems... oddly chosen.</p> <p><strong>8.26pm</strong>: All this music is about roughnecks and cowboys and the West, backing up the message of hard-drinking \u2014 no, hang on a second! \u2014 teetotal roughneck Mitt Romney. And yet the fact is that I am eating a chicken salad with lettuce and olives, and that you can buy lattes and espressos in the press centre here, which you certainly couldn't in Denver. The Republican convention is elitist.</p> <p><strong>8.29pm</strong>: Here's Mike Huckabee, sneerily thanking \"the elite media\" for doing something he thought \"couldn't be done\" \u2014 uniting the party behind McCain/Palin. (That's a rather double-edged compliment, when you think about it.) The reporting has been \"tackier than a costume change at a Madonna concert\" \u2014 that's revenge for <a href=\"http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gH5l-Singpk9F7-gUBHv0qOYYsxA\">this</a>.</p> <p><strong>8.32pm</strong>: Mike Huckabee <em>actually just said this</em>: \"My Dad lifted heavy things\". And this: \"I was in college before I found out it wasn't supposed to hurt to take a shower.\" It's something to do with having to clean himself with stones, because he grew up so poor. But this is an almost entirely crazy speech, I'm afraid to say. That's an unbiased opinion.</p> <p><strong>8.36pm</strong>: \"Sarah Palin got more votes running for mayor of Wasilla than Joe Biden got running for president.\" Laughter and cheers. I keep pointing this out, but apparently the Republican top brass aren't reading this blog: you can't simultaneously praise Palin's experience while getting a laugh from it because of its smallness. Well, you can, but I will call you out for logical inconsistency.</p> <p><strong>8.38pm</strong>: BREAKING NEWS: John McCain is a war hero! Oh. My. God. Now we are hearing some utterly batty story about a teacher called Martha who wouldn't let her students have a desk unless they could tell her how to earn it. Hard work and good behaviour wasn't enough. Nobody could guess the answer. Eventually she revealed that the answer was... </p> <p>\"Martha opened the door of her classroom. In walked 27 veterans, some wearing uniforms from years gone by, but each one carrying a school desk. As they carefully and quietly arranged the desks in neat rows, Martha said, 'You don't have to earn your desks\u2026these guys already did.'\"</p> <p>What? WHAT? I understand the idea that the military defends our freedom, but this desk parable thing is just baffling. Did this actually happen? Did someone fire the teacher? Now he's explaining that John McCain enabled him, Mike Huckabee, to have a school desk. I'm sorry, I'm almost incoherent with confusion and must pause for a few moments. Luckily it's the governor of Hawai'i now, so it's a good opportunity for that.</p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong>: Themes of the evening so far: xenophobia, \"anti-elitist\" rabble-rousing, media-bashing, smalltown boosterism versus liberal city people. Pretty unpleasant, all told. </p> <p>Shortly, we'll be hearing from Rudy Giuliani, and right now the Hawa'iian governor is setting us up for that by talking a lot about Palin's experience as a mayor. Then comes Giuliani, a mayor. And thus a mental connection is forged...</p> <p>\"You can fit more than 250 states the size of [Joe Biden's home state,] Delaware within the borders of Alaska!\" says Linda Lingle, the governor of Hawai'i, thereby <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.palin2\">adopting the talking point I suggested yesterday</a>.</p> <p>\"PALIN POWER!\" says one of the handmade signs the crowd's waving. I wonder if it's one of the handmade signs you see Republican party operatives blatantly handing out to delegates on the way in here...</p> <p><strong>9.01pm</strong>: Rudy! Rudy! Rudy! He's here to scare us all about the terrorist threat.</p> <p>\"The American people realize this election represents a turning point. In two months they will decide the future direction of our nation. It's a decision to follow one path or another. We the people, the citizens of the United States, get to decide our next president. Not the leftwing media, not Hollywood celebrities, not anyone else, but the people of America!\" </p> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: Voting for a president is like hiring someone to protect your family from danger and evil, and also danger. McCain has sacrificed for America \"as few do,\" he says, with real aggression in his voice. </p> <p>Wait, wait, wait, WHAT? John McCain <strong>was a prisoner of war</strong>. He has proved his commitment with his blood. On the other hand, Obama worked as a \"community organizer\". \"What?\" says Giuliani, pretending not to understand. He laughs unpleasantly. The crowd laughs. \"Then he ran for the state legislature - where nearly 130 times he was unable to make a decision yes or no. It was too tough. He voted 'present.' I didn't know about this 'vote present' when I was mayor of New York City. Sarah Palin didn't get to vote present when she was mayor or governor.\"</p> <p>\"Barack Obama has never led anything. Nothing. Nada. Nada. Nothing.\" This is real, jeering anti-Obama stuff, the nastiest we've heard, and the delegates are loving it \u2014 yelping and whooping.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm</strong>: Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=elite_media\">makes</a> a good point about the night's attacks on the \"elite media\": \"The point here is not to get votes: Americans aren't very worried about the \"elite media,\" whoever that is. It's to initimidate the media. Scare them. Suggest that they'll be locked out of access, cordoned off from stories, beaten down by Fox News. This is an attack on the media. The question now is how insecure the media really is.\"</p> <p><strong>9.17pm</strong>: 9/11 9/11 9/11 9/11 9/11. Giuliani gets huge applause for arguing that the Democrats in Denver were too weak to attack Islamic terrorism, owing to political correctness. The gloves are off tonight.</p> <p><strong>9.18pm</strong>: If you say the war in Iraq is lost, you are saying that Osama bin Laden has won, and that makes you a terrorist. Or something like that. </p> <p>There's something rather troubling about the way in which Giuliani enjoys the roiling up the audience. He claps softly to himself, and chuckles.</p> <p>9/11, terrorism, Israel. Rudy is just listing general concepts now, in a row.</p> <p><strong>9.24pm</strong>: \"I'm sorry that Barack Obama feels [Sarah Palin's] hometown isn't <em>cosmopolitan</em> enough. I'm sorry it's not <em>flashy</em> enough. Maybe they cling to religion there,\" says the former mayor of New York City who lived for years in one of the best townhouses on the Upper East Side. Maybe there is a point at which what you're saying becomes so indefensibly absurd that it meets up round the other side and becomes sensible?</p> <p>...And then more of this stuff about shaking up Washington, as if the current president was not a Republican. </p> <p>\"How dare they question whether Sarah Palin has enough time to be with her children and be vice-president?\" (I really haven't come across this criticism much.) \"When do they ever ask a man that question?\" </p> <p><strong>9.29pm:</strong> Sarah Palin walks on stage. The crowd are uncontrollable, completely uncontrollable with ecstasy. She swiftly slaughters a moose, and then two minutes later the noise subsides and she begins.</p> <p><strong>9.32pm:</strong> \"I will be honoured to accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States.\" Picking up the evening's theme, she slates the \"pollsters and the pundants\" [sic] who overlooked John McCain's \"determination, resolve, and sheer guts.\" Her son gets a namecheck \u2014 he's off to Iraq soon \u2014 and stands to receive a portion of the almost constant applause. \"One week from tomorrow, September 11th, he'll deploy to Iraq.\"</p> <p><strong>9.36pm:</strong> \"Track is the eldest of our five children...\" and now introductions for Bristol, Willow and Piper, who all look rather overwhelmed. And \"a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig.\" (Todd Palin's holding him.) \"From the inside, no family ever seems typical. Our family has the same ups and downs and any others. Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge. And children with special needs inspire a very, very special love.\" Wait a minute, I thought the families were off limits? </p> <p><strong>9.42pm:</strong> She grew up among people who are \"always proud of America,\" she says, echoing Romney's anti-Michelle Obama line from earlier. \"I was just your average hockey mom, and signed up for the PTA...\" (\"Hockey Mom! Hockey Mom!\" the crowd shout.) \"I love those hockey moms, you know, they say, the difference between a hockey mom and a pitbull? Lipstick.\" OK. \"When I ran for city council, I didn't need focus groups...\" The strategy here is fairly straightforward. \"I was mayor of our hometown, and since our opponents seem to look down on that experience, let me explain to them what the job involves...</p> <p>\"I guess a smalltown mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities.\" There's your zinger of the evening. </p> <p>...Wait, somebody just got dragged off the floor by security. More on that if I figure out what was going on.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: \"Some in the media\" consider her unqualified. Boos, of a rather goodnatured variety. \"NBC! NBC!\" someone's shouting, loudly. Hmm, this media war could backfire yet. \"No... uh... oh...\" Palin seems briefly confused by something, but soon recovers. </p> <p><strong>9.48pm</strong>: Her message here, looking back at her time in Alaska, is that she's a reformer, a challenger from outside; clearly, outsiderhood is a prerequisite for that, and too much \"experience\" could be a problem. Also, she sold the governor's jet on eBay, we learn yet again. \"I love to drive myself to work, and I thought we could muddle through without the governor's personal chef.\" It's very odd, listening to a serviceable but not amazing public speech being received as if it is the best oratory the world has ever heard.</p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: Excuse me, my computer crashed. Now, after a passage on energy \u2014&#xa0;drill, drill, drill!, essentially, and as commenter Wikipedia notes, a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN3125537020080901  \">misrepresentation</a> of her position on the \"Bridge to Nowhere\" -- we're into the Obama attack part.</p> <p>\"We've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers. And there is much to like and admire about our opponent. But listening to him speak, it's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or reform - not even in the state senate. This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting, and never use the word 'victory' except when he's talking about his own campaign. But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, when the stadium lights go out, and those styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot - what exactly is our opponent's plan?\" \u2014 essentially, it's talking to evil terrorists, weakening America, and increasing taxes: lots and lots of taxes.</p> <p>It's a relentless attack on Obama as effete, self-absorbed, treating the presidential campaign as a \"journey of personal discovery\". And of McCain as a maverick who has the Washington lobbyists shaking in their boots. What strange times we live in...</p> <p><strong>10.02pm</strong>: \"And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they are always, quote, 'fighting for you,' let us face the matter squarely. There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you, in places where winning means survival and defeat means death, and that man is John McCain... It's a long way from the fear and pain and squalor of a six-by-four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office. But if Senator McCain is elected president, that is the journey he will have made.\" JOHN MCCAIN WAS A PRISONER OF WAR, PEOPLE! I really don't know how many times you have to be told before it gets through.</p> <p>\"For a season, a gifted speaker can inspire with his words. For a lifetime, John McCain has inspired with his deeds... I ask you to join our cause. Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States. Thank you all, and may God bless America.\" Insane levels of applause and chants of \"Sa-rah!\", \"Sa-rah!\", and the whole Palin family join her on stage. Palin wields Trig aloft. This speech has been the first time here that I've seen anything to rival Denver levels of enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> And in a parallel to Obama's surprise arrival at the end of Joe Biden's speech, here's John McCain. \"Tremendous, tremendous, fantastic, tremendous,\" he says, vaguely hugging the Palins. \"Don't you think we made the right choice for the next vice-president of the United States? And what a beautiful family!\" Militaristic music. McCain and Palin are both doing an awful Republican version of Hillary Clinton's already sufficiently awful pointing-and-smiling thing.</p> <p>Shortly, these psyched-up delegates will hold a roll-call vote officially to nominate McCain. First, three country singers including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rich_(musician)\">John Rich</a> are reading out random bits of famous American speeches and documents, in between lines of the national anthem. Extremely strange. </p> <p>Brilliant, now Rich is singing his criminally stupid song Raising McCain. </p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong> ...Well, I don't know. As a foreigner, a European, a non-prisoner of war, an elitist and an employee of the media, I'm the enemy, so it would be strange if I responded to that speech with overwhelming joy. But you do have to wonder how this stuff will play at the moderate margin, the place we're led to believe that the votes in this election will be won. If there are indeed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/sarahpalin.johnmccain\">two hopelessly incompatible Americas</a>, how do you find the balance, tactically speaking, between energising the base and alienating the centre?</p> <p>Josh Marshall <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/213128.php\">reckons</a> this is \"a sign that the McCain campaign has abandoned an effort to compete for swing voters and go back to the base energising strategy that worked for President Bush in 2004. The numbers make that look like a tough proposition. But I think a few months from now, everyone will agree this was a mistake.\" He also points out that Rudy Giuliani must have overrun, because the schedulers abandoned a video tribute to Palin. (Marshall on Giuliani: \"I know the people in the hall loved it. But I think a lot of people will see it as whacked. Rancid. Curdled.\")</p> <p>Then again, at the wonderful little playpen of conservatism that is <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTUyZjg4MTE1ZGIwNDBmN2MwMWU4MzY4NjlmNzQ5YzA=\">The Corner</a>: \"Is it me, or is this one just a whole 'nother level of maturity and seriousness compared to the Dem convention?\" And <a href=\"http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/jpodhoretz/26561\">John Podhoretz</a>: \"In terms of impact, I would say this speech is easily the equal of Obama's in 2004.\" But Andrew Sullivan passes along <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/09/email-of-the-ni.html\">one anecdotal hint</a> of a moderate Republican feeling alienated by tonight's speeches.</p> <p><strong>10.50pm</strong>: On the US cable networks, which I haven't been watching during tonight's proceedings, the much-repeated phrase about Palin, apparently, is \"A Star Is Born.\"</p> <p>...Well, this election just got a whole lot nastier, I think, if the Republicans are indeed giving up on any attempt to win over the centre, and instead returning to the base-focused strategies of 2000 and 2004, and declaring war on the media, and on the coastal elites, and an big city dwellers, and on liberals (even though Rudy Giuliani is most of these, and McCain in many respects, for that matter). Questions: will it work? How do the calls for bipartisanship we've seen over the last few days fit with that? They don't, obviously, but will the contradiction be problematic for the Republicans? And how does the Obama campaign respond \u2014 get fiercer, or reach for moral high ground? </p> <p>McCain won the roll call vote, by the way. He's now officially the nominee.</p> <p>POSTSCRIPT</p> <p><strong>11.40pm</strong>: As a liberal European elitist journalist currently residing on the east coast of the United States, I wasn't relishing heading out into the crowds of elated delegates. Turned out I needn't have worried, though: \"You British are different,\" one Colorado delegate told me, grinning. \"You're not as bad as the other Europeans.\"</p> <p>Three preliminary conclusions from my conversations and eavesdroppings:</p> <p>1. They're thrilled. <em>Thrilled.</em> Not the glistening eyes of Invesco Field, perhaps, but it's real, tingly excitement, and it's all about Palin.<br>2. The \"reform\" line that Palin made plain tonight is crucial to them. It's what justifies McCain's selection of an outsider; alchemically, it turns a lack of experience into a plus point.<br>3. They don't see \u2014 or admit to seeing, anyhow \u2014 any contradiction between tonight's high-octane partisanship and last night's call to rise above politics.</p> <p>\"Fantastic. Just fantastic,\" said John Carson, a Colorado delegate. \"There were a lot of good speeches, but Palin was just fantastic. She showed strength, she's obviously bright, she understands energy issues \u2014 she really projected the image of a leader tonight.\" Did the partisan tone run counter to the call to rise above politics? \"That's more a question of how you govern when you're in office \u2014 talking to the other side when you need to,\" he said. \"We're here to nominate our candidate and to win an election, so you're going to get partisanship.\"</p> <p>Lynn Hosemann, a Mississippi delegate: \"I'm so excited! She showed she had the right concept of governing: to serve the people. That's what government should be about. It shouldn't be self-serving. She's a reformer, and she showed she could take on the existing Washington establishment.\" But hasn't the Washington establishment been headed by a Republican for eight years? \"It's not just about the last eight years. We have become a government of professional politicians. We need citizen servants. She is a citizen servant!\" </p> <p>Some people sounded almost as if they'd prefer Palin to be running as president.</p> <p>Many more responses in Daniel Nasaw's piece, available <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections\">here</a>, soon.</p> <p>Goodnight \u2014 thanks for reading and commenting.</p>",
