  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>England's opening match of the Stanford Super Series starts at 9.30pm GMT</strong>. Rob will be here before then so get your emails in early. Alternatively, read the prolific \"Staff and agencies\" on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/26/stanford-super-series-cricket1\">Stanford Superstars' opening match</a>, Andy Bull on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/26/stanford-super-series-cricket\">the age-old business of profiteering in cricket</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/oct/26/marcus-trescothick-twenty20\">Marcus Trescothick's take</a> on the whole shebang.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The teams</strong> England make only one, enforced change from the side that thrashed South Africa in the 50-over series at the end of the summer: Ryan Sidebottom comes in for the injured Steve Harmison. Middlesex include Neil Carter, aka Carter The Unstoppable Six Machine, whose loan signing from Warwickshire was called a \"disgrace\" by Kevin Pietersen. As usual, KP was spot on: counties have a flimsy enough identity these days without them being able to bring in anybody they want for these extra games. Disappointigly, Middlesex are without their injured all-rounder Tyron Henderson, who is replaced by the highly promising, 9ft 4ins seam bowler Steve Finn, an England bowler of the future according to a few good judges, and me. Like England need any more hit-the-pitch bowlers, eh?</p> <p><strong>England</strong> Prior (wk), Bell, Pietersen (capt), Collingwood, Flintoff, Shah, Wright, Patel, Broad, Sidebottom, Anderson.</p> <p><strong>Middlesex</strong> Carter, Strauss, Joyce, Morgan, Malan, Dexter, Scott (wk), Murtagh, Udal (capt), Kartik, Finn.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Evening boys, evening girls. The entities of club and country have been squabbling over territory for decades \u2013 if you type 'club v country' into google you get 92,400,000 hits, which is only a couple of gazillion fewer than you get if you type 'free bongo. please. please?' \u2013 but most of the warring has amounted to slinging abuse from a safe distance. Very rarely have a country and a club from the same country got down and dirty in the sporting arena, which adds a certain frisson to tonight's match in Antigua between Middlesex, aka the Twenty20 champions of England, and England, aka England. It's the second of the warm-ups for next Saturday's Stanford 20/20 for 40 Winks For Those Of Us Who Give One About The Soul Of Cricket.</p> <p>It's not quite as enticing as a battle between, say, Manchester United and England would be, because the hierarchy is less obvious in cricket (Middlesex, lest we forget, are in division two of the county championship) and the enmity non-existent. But what does make this interesting is the fact that, while Middlesex are a lean, grooved Twenty20 side, most of the England XI have barely played this form of game. And though England have won all three T20 internationals this year, all against New Zealand, their overall record is ropey: W6 L8. This should certainly be the most interesting of the warm-ups. Pity the fool, for example, who gets to cover Middlesex v Trinidad &amp; Tobago tomorrow. What's that you say Mr 9-to-5 Man? Oh.</p> <p>Anyway, there's also the Andrew Strauss factor to keep us away from watching MOTD2 and witnessing another step towards <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/26/liverpool-chelsea\">the end of the world sometime next May</a>. Strauss is in the Middlesex side, and it'll be interesting to see how he reacts to being effectively labelled a worse Twenty20 opener than Alistair Cook, an insult that could probably only be exceeded if you were <em>compared to Dawson Leery and Craig Revel Horwood in the same week by members of the fairer sex</em>.</p> <p>Other things to look out for ahead of next Saturday include the pitch, as England have a lot of eggs in the basket marked 'tall fast bowlers' and there has been talk of the Stanford Superstars playing a phalanx of slow bowlers (I'd call them spinners but I suspect that might be stretching it), and also who gets voted off Strictly, as that will really inform the evening entertainment six days hence.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>England win the toss and will bat first</strong> KP, when asked which four players haven't made it today, says \"Harmison, Cook, Bopara and - I've just got off a plane - er, someone else.\" Graeme Swann might write a song about that one day. Let's hope not though eh.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Apologies</strong> if there are (even more) typos (than usual): we're getting used to a new, ZX81-style keyboard. </p> <p>Anyway, here are some links to pass the time before the game starts in around 20 minutes.</p> <p>A Facebook group <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/group.php?gid=29978794931\">that started as a joke but is now getting rather serious</a>.</p> <p>A podcasty preview of <a href=\"http://www.spincricket.com/middlesex.html\">Middlesex's involvement in this thing</a>.</p> <p>Yet another <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=82880408\">dead dead good band</a> from the Brooklyn stable. Half Asleep is fantastic.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Okay</strong> The players are on the field, with their black bats (England) and pink shirts (Middlesex).</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 7-0 (Bell 5, Prior 2)</strong> Cracking start from Bell, who times an outswinging length delivery from Murtagh down the ground for four from the first ball. Disgusted with such frivolity, he blocks the next couple of deliveries and knuckles down to the task of batting through the 20 overs for 13 not out. Later in the over a misfield at mid-off from Shaun Udal, 972, turns nought into two for Prior.</p> <p>\"Rob,\" says Paul Frame, \"is it just me or has the axing of Graeme Swann just passed everyone by? This is after all a spinner who averages under 30 for England. Is he really that out of favour with Pietersen and Moores? This pitch is low and slow, as last night's game suggests, so why not drop Wright and play both Patel and Swann, leaving Anderson, Sidebottom, Flintoff, Broad and Collingwood to lead the pace attack?\" Well on the first point I think they wanted eight batsmen in the 50-over team, which is why Patel replaced Swann. On the second I think they prefer the current balance of bowlers (Wright won't be dropped as he's the only specialist death hitter), so will have a look at the pitch tonight and, when they are strangled by Udal and Kartik, bring in Swann (probably for Anderson) for the other warm-up game.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 11-0 (Bell 7, Prior 3)</strong> Neil Carter, the loan signing who has become Public Enemy No27, opens the bowling at the other end. Left-arm, fast-medium, seaming away. It looks routine stuff, but he does snake one past the outside edge of Prior, who incidentally is batting outside his crease. </p> <p>Four from the over, all in ones. It's ostensibly a slow start from England, but you suspect expectations of what represents a decent score will drop as the week goes on. Certainly I wouldn't expect any scores of 200 or over: 140-odd batting first was enough last night.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 17-0 (Bell 12, Prior 4)</strong> After around 427 dropped catches last night, here's another, and it was a sitter. Murtagh shaped one away and Bell just steered it straight to slip, where Murali Kartik dropped a dolly. If you did that in catching practice you'd be bent over the slip-catching cradle and given 40 lashes. Probably. That aside it's another quiet over - a terribly slow outfield isn't helping - and thus far the whole thing, in front of an audience of tens, is extremely low key.</p> <p>\"So what about this third-umpire consultation business then?\" says Jeremy Theobald. \"Mr Stanford has obviously paid some of the best umpires handsomely to be there and they can ask their mate with a TV and all the technology when they're not sure. Doesn't this mean that we'll find out exactly how many times they're guessing?\" I'm more concerned, as Alex Roberts points out, about the time delays.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 21-0 (Bell 12, Prior 8)</strong> Prior comes down the track and flails the new bowler, the impossibly handsome Steven Finn, square on the off side for his first boundary. Finn then had a big shout for LBW from a sharp off-cutter, but Prior was miles down the track so Rudi Koertzen couldn't give it with a clear conscience. Replays suggested it hit him outside the line anyway. Decent over that from Finn, who is, as they say, a prospect.</p> <p>\"Last night's coverage had quite a bit more chatter audible through the mics than we are used to and it seems the same tonight,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I hope someone's told Matt Prior, because although we're past the watershed, my ears can be a little delicate. Elsewhere in the coverage, the wholly open consultation procedures between on and off field umpires worked really well, and Mike Haysman roving on the boundary made Charles Colville sound like John Arlott.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 29-0 (Bell 17, Prior 11)</strong> Bumble reckons this pitch has more pace than yesterday's (same ground but a different strip), and Carter, who has replaced Murtagh, trampolines a short one over Prior's premeditated cross-bat flap. The next ball is full, wide, and blazed through the covers by Prior... for two. This outfield is too slow for any kind of cricket but certainly for that which purports to have razzmatazz oozing from every pore. There are no outfield issues later in the over when Carter bounces Bell, who top-edges a hook for a one-bounce boundary.</p> <p>\"Yo Rob, I want royalties for the Carter USM 'gag',\" says Andy Bradshaw. Given how bad it is, shouldn't you pay me royalties for using it?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 36-0 (Bell 20, Prior 14)</strong> A no-ball from Finn gives Bell a free hit, but he can only slice it straight to point. Prior then only just gets down on a middle-and-leg yorker from Finn. Seven from the over. Bell has 20 from 18 balls and Prior 14 from 19.</p> <p>\"Neil Carter's up at 89mph,\" says Gary Naylor. Don't worry, there's more. That's not it. \"I've a feeling that the two speeds that work in T20 are 88mph and 48mph: the former because you can't get set against really quick stuff (though the edges do fly) and 48mph because the bat speed needed for the weight of shot is a gift given to few (and Dawid Malan, up later, is one of them). It's this 75mph to 85mph stuff that gets slammed.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 41-0 (Bell 22, Prior 17)</strong> Here's where the contest really starts: Murali Kartik, the excellent Indian left-arm spinner, is on, and his first over costs just five. His third ball, a fraction short, turns very sharply and takes the edge of Prior's attempted cut. But there's no slip and it goes away for a single. Nasser and Jimmy Adams make the point that 150 is probably a good score on this pitch. So far we've had three boundaries in seven overs: it's great entertainment this!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 43-1 (Bell run out 23)</strong> This is ever-so-slightly selfish batting from Bell and Prior, whose focus seems to be two-thirds this game and one-third having a look for the rest of the week. But there the partnership ends: Bell tucks the new bowler Udal to square leg and sets off, and the loan signing Neil Carter hits the stumps at the bowler's end with Bell comfortably short. Bell made 23 from 25 balls, and the innings was as pointless as those figures make it sound.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 44-1 (Prior 18, Shah 0)</strong> Shah comes in at No3, which is surely taking the keep-the-balance-of-the-successful-50-over-side too far. I have no problem with Shah at No3 in, say, the third over, but not the eighth. Anyway, just three from an excellent first over from Udal.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 54-1 (Prior 23, Shah 6)</strong> Shah is, of course, playing against his own county and so there's a bit of banter. I'm tempted to presume it's good-natured, but by the look of manic intensity of Shah's face I'm not so sure. Then again he looks like that even when he's asleep. I'd imagine.</p> <p>Kartik bowls a no-ball, which is criminal for a slow bowler etc, but Prior can only cleave one from the free hit. Shah then gets his first boundary with an amazing shot, walking right across to Kartik and tickling it <em>this</em> far wide of his leg stump and away for four. \"God this feels slow,\" says Andy Bradshaw, vrooming his Scalextric set as hard as he can.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 59-1 (Prior 25, Shah 9)</strong> England are faffing around a bit here, but we shouldn't ignore the fact that this is a warm-up. I personally think they'll lose this game and rejig their line-up accordingly for later in the week. And still lose, but that's not the point. Five from Udal's over, whose wicket-to-wicket treacle is proving as awkward as ever.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 63-2 (Prior b Kartik 29)</strong> Kartik hurries an arm-ball through Prior with almost contemptuous ease. A blessing in disguise for England, however, as here He comes.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 68-2 (Shah 8, Pietersen 3)</strong> Another no-ball from Kartik, which etc. KP shapes to switch hit it, then tries to blast it over the leg side, but only connects with the dusty night air.</p> <p>\"Can't say much for the atmosphere, it's like a church fete that has just been told the tombola is delayed,\" says Lee Calvert, who knows all about good atmospheres as an Oldham fan. \"Also, you've gotta feel for those dancing girls who do a twirl when there's a boundary; three of them had to put their fags out when Shah snaffled that four.\" </p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 70-2 (Shah 8, Pietersen 4)</strong> Another good over from Udal: very, very full to Pietersen, who can't get him away. Two from ther over.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 73-3 (Pietersen st Scott b Kartik 5)</strong> Pietersen, who by his own admission isn't much of a Twenty20 player, is duped beautifully by Kartik. He teased Pietersen down the track in the flight, and the ball spat viciously past Pietersen's leg-side flail for the wicketkeeper Ben Scott to complete the stumping with Pietersen miles out. Excellent stuff.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 73-3 (Shah 11, Flintoff 0)</strong> The new batsman Flintoff - who is wearing Harmison's shirt because he left his at the tema hotel - is beaten by his first two deliveries from Kartik. The first was a jaffa. Kartik ends with the good figures of 4-0-27-2.</p> <p>Here's Peter Lucas. \"It's a bit strange that someone who wants to introduce cricket to America, using the \"exciting\" format of T20 has a ground that's so sluggish that for a Test it would have draw etched into the outfield.\" What he said. It makes no sense whatsoever.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 77-3 (Shah 13, Flintoff 2)</strong> Andrew Strauss has just been responsible for one of the worst dropped catches I have ever seen. Flintoff groped with hard hands at Udal and the ball plopped gently up in the air for Strauss, running in from short midwicket, to put it down. It was seriously one of the worst dropped catches you will ever, ever see. Remember Mike Gatting's face of horror after he put down a dolly from Praveen Amre in 1992-93? This catch was at least 947 times easier than that. </p> <p>Udal ends with the outstanding figures of 4-0-14-0, so between them the spinners have taken two for 41 from eight. That sound you hear is Peter Moores ripping up Plan A. If he doesn't, pig-headedness will never have been costlier.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 82-3 (Shah 16, Flintoff 5)</strong> Middlesex turn to the part-time leg spin of Malan, which is fair enough in view of the pitch. Just five from his first over and, at the risk of stating the obvious, England need to get a serious jump on here.</p> <p>\"Graeme Swann is playing himself into this team without actually doing anything,\" says Gary Naylor. \"In the early years of limited-overs cricket, the talk was that spinners would be squeezed out of the game: in the early years of T20, the talk might be that pacemen will be squeezed out of the game. Trinidad and Tobago open the bowling with a leg-spinner.\" What he said.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 87-3 (Shah 19, Flintoff 6)</strong> Five from Carter's over, which included yet another dropped catch. Shah lifted Carter high to cow corner, with one hand coming off the bat, and after running a fair way round the boundary to his right Ed Joyce fumbled what, in normal cricket, was a pretty straightforward chance. Everyone's laughing now, but next Saturday it might not be so funny.</p> <p>\"Rob - I take issue with Peter Lucas and yourself,\" puddemups Gary Naylor. \"The pitch has a bit of pace, but England are just not enterprising enough. What's the point of having Wright at No8, if the top order are poking around? The batsmen need to use their feet and hit the ball straight and hard - England's approach is dismal.\" I agree that England haven't been great, and I fear that Moores may be too pig-headed to adjust as he should for the other games, but the outfield is one of the slowest I've seen in a long time. That can't be a good thing.<br> Not having Mascarenhas here is criminal, mind. The outfield rarely matters when he's involved.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 102-3 (Shah 26, Flintoff 14)</strong> That's the big over England needed: 15 from it. First Murtagh slips down a full toss and Shah bottom-hands it for a massive six over midwicket. Ninety-seven metres apparently. Two balls later Murtagh bowls a length ball to Flintoff that is clattered over long on for six more. </p> <p>\"I concur,\" says Lee Calvert, embarrassingly sycophantic as ever. Shameless git. \"That was the worst drop I have ever seen. Ever. Made Herschelle Gibbs' effort in 1999 vs Steve Waugh look like something Mark Waugh would have struggled with.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 111-3 (Shah 33, Flintoff 16)</strong> Another dropped catch, the fourth of this match and (I think) the 11th of the series so far. In fairness that wasn't easy, as Shah slapped a full-toss from Finn to the left of Murtagh at long on. I still think he'd have taken that maybe eight times out of 10 ordinarily. There must be light issues.</p> <p>Shah gets more luck later in the over when he snicks a yahoo over the keeper's head for four. Nine from a good over from Finn.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 111-4 (Flintoff c Morgan b Carter 16)</strong> After all those dropped catches, a brilliant catch. Flintoff screeched Carter to long off, where Morgan took a remarkably nonchalant catch above his head with his back foot <em>right by the boundary rope</em>. Morgan didn't seem sure - he didn't appeal, or celebrate, or do <em>so much as scratch his derriere</em> in fact - so Asad Rauf went to the third umpire, but Flintoff, possibly bored of this utter filth, just swaggered off. In the end he loitered by the gate while the third umpire decided, and he was eventually given out.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 118-4 (Shah 37, Collingwood 3)</strong> Collingwood is the new batsman, which surprises me given that Luke Wright is in the team.</p> <p>\"I like baseball and would love to watch the World Series game tonight, but I do find the fact that they have to wear a glove to catch the ball hilarious,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Americans watching these two matches will think it's hilarious that the fielders don't wear a glove. This ground has been used for lots of matches, so if the lights aren't good enough, they'd know by now wouldn't they?\" Do they always play at this hour? I suppose they do. I can't believe it's pressure, as there isn't any in this game. Strauss's in particular was from another world.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 121-4 (Shah 39, Collingwood 3)</strong> This Finn looks a smart fellow, which is a nice thing to have in addition to being 6ft 7ins. Four deliveries in his final over beat the bat, with only three runs coming from it. </p> <p>Middlesex were largely excellent - especially, predictably, their two spinners in the middle - but all in all that was pretty poor from England. They will justify the inevitable defeat (six wickets, 17 balls to spare) by saying they need to acclimatise, and that's a legitimate excuse up to a point, but as Mr Naylor outlined earlier in this innings there was a disconcerting rigidity to their performance, both collectively and individually. </p> <p>See you in 10 minutes for Middlesex's reply.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Innings-break chit-chat</strong> Er, there is none. But the players should be on again at 2310.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1st over: Middlesex 5-0 (chasing 122; Strauss 4, Carter 0)</strong> Anderson swings a first-ball yorker into Strauss, who does well to squeeze it away. The second ball is shorter - still full - but swinging in again, and Strauss does the same. But when Anderson drops short later in the over, Strauss swivel-pulls him round the corner for four. A wide makes it a decent over for Middlesex.</p> <p>Anyone still with us?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Middlesex 7-0 (chasing 122; Strauss 5, Carter 0)</strong> Ryan Sidebottom, who has had a remarkable and - in one-day cricket at least - undeserved fall from grace, has a real chance here because of the injury to Harmison. Figures of 4-0-15-2, his daily bread in T20, will make him undroppable and put pressure on Jimmy Anderson and even Stuart Broad if Swann comes in. He immediately beats a rustic hump from the left-handed Carter, and only a leg-bye and a single come from a solid, disciplined over.</p> <p>\"Anderson's entire career almost in one over there: clever inswingers, a short one - clobbered, and a wide,\" says Lee Calvert. \"If he'd injured his knee we would have had the full house.\" Only if he'd slipped on a bleeding-skunk wig for a couple of the deliveries. Was that the haircut he had? I can't remember anymore.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Middlesex 14-0 (chasing 122; Strauss 7, Carter 5)</strong> Strauss cracks Anderson through the covers and gets, er, a single. Anderson then loses his run-up completely; when he finds it, Carter makes room to blast him high over extra-cover for four.</p> <p>\"How's Sidebottom looking?\" says Paul Frame. \"Is he the bowler that turned up at Edgbaston or the bowler in Sri Lanka, bowling consistently in the high 80s mph?\" I'm no human speedgun - I'm no human anything - but he looks like he's lost a bit of timber, and certainly he looked better than the joke who struggled in at half rat-power in his last Test.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Middlesex 16-1 (Strauss b Sidebottom 8)</strong> Strauss tries to hoick a ball that is too full, seams in a touch and splays his stumps. That was simple stuff: Strauss missed, Sidebottom hit. Next!</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4th over: Middlesex 18-1 (chasing 122; Carter 5, Joyce 2)</strong> \"If, as it looks, that spin could be the major player in this competition, perhaps I've got Sir Allen wrong,\" says Peter Lucas. \"Like the Bond villain he seems to be, his real intentions are concealed. By making Twenty20 look so boring, he really wants proper cricket to take its proper place on the stage again.\" We wish. Stanford still thinks Atherton vs Donald is a little-known libel case from the 1970s.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>5th over: Middlesex 20-1 (chasing 122; Carter 7, Joyce 2)</strong> Carter looks like the sort of bloke who would struggle to move his feet if he had a maniacal Joe Pesci shooting at them and ordering him to dance. He has a disgusting mow at the first two deliveries from the new bowler, Stuart Broad, and misses. Finally, after five dot balls, he clumps one towards deep midwicket, where Anderson running back just can't get hands on a very awkward chance.</p> <p>The camera cuts to Allen Stanford, grinning inanely, surrounded by young, attractive women, giggling away at his every $20 bil- sorry, at his every engagingly witty aside. What. A. Sorry. Effing. Business.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6th over: Middlesex 30-1 (chasing 122; Carter 8, Joyce 11)</strong> Allen Stanford will give you $0m for guessing what happened in that Flintoff over. Yep, yet another dropped catch. It was a trickyish one, driven to the left of Collingwood at cover point, but somebody as good as him would normally take that. Later in the over Joyce inadvertently squeezes four to fine leg to make it a good over for Middlesex: ten from it.</p> <p>\"I don't know what I'm more disturbed by; the utterly pedestrian nature of this game, or the unseemly shot of Allen Stanford with about five girls sat on his knee that has just been shown,\" says Lee Calvert, doing well to type with five girls sat on his knee.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>7th over: Middlesex 33-1 (chasing 122; Carter 9, Joyce 11)</strong> \"Join the club!\" screams David Lloyd when Kevin Pietersen puts down yet another catch. Carter, who had been struggling to lay a black bat on it against the hitherto excellent Broad, eventually clumped one miles in the air towards long-off, and Pietersen running back shelled what was an essentially routine chance. It's getting surreal now, and there might be $20m on one of those in six days' time.</p> <p>\"OBO regulars Lynn Bashforth, Jeremy Theobald and I spent some very agreeable afternoons and evenings watching T20 from the vantage point of the Shelf in the Oval Pavilion,\" begins Gary Naylor, sucking tearfully on a Werthers Original and stroking his ankle-length beard. \"Some things became absolutely clear - and one was that the straight-bat shots were so much more profitable than the cross-batted hoicks. Batsmen seem too quickly to forget that you have to hit the ball first, before you hit it hard.\" Strauss's shot wasn't the best, was it?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Middlesex 36-2 (Carter c Patel b Flintoff 11)</strong> That's a really good catch from Samit Patel. Carter pulled Flintoff towards backward square leg, and Patel running round got to his knees, sideways-on to the boundary, and judged the catch splendidly. Carter made 11 from 27 balls, which tells you all you need to know really.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>8th over: Middlesex 36-2 (chasing 122; Joyce 12, Morgan 0)</strong> Eoin Morgan, who oozes unorthodoxy, is the new batsman.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>9th over: Middlesex 39-2 (chasing 122; Joyce 13, Morgan 2)</strong><br>Three from another good over from Broad. \"Obviously over rates in T20 with 13 overs and nine wickets to go aren't a reliable guide, but so far Middlesex are still behind the England run rate,\" notes Indy Neogy. \"Seems like a poor ground indeed for T20. England might even win if batting is so hard that Bell's strike-rate looks normal.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>10th over: Middlesex 42-2 (chasing 122; Joyce 14, Morgan 4)</strong> KP is bringing himself on, and these could be the decisive overs because on a bad day he goes for plenty. His first two balls are full-tosses, but he gets away with conceding only one run. Two more singles make it a very acceptable over for England, and Middlesex need 80 from the last 10 overs, having made barely half that from the first 10.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Middlesex 42-3 (Morgan c Anderson b Broad 4)</strong> England are squeezing the life out of this game very impressively. Morgan, on the charge, screws a short one from Broad towards mid-on, where Anderson running round takes a straightforward catch.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>11th over: Middlesex 47-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 15, Malan 4)</strong> From the very next ball Ed Joyce was dropped at backward point, a very difficult diving chance to Collingwood. Broad's last ball is slapped over point for four by Malan, but he nonetheless ends with the outstanding figures of 4-0-13-1.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>12th over: Middlesex 54-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 17, Malan 9)</strong> Malan could be the key to this game, and he reverse-sweeps the first ball he faces from Pietersen for four. He really timed that. Seven from the over, and my 20p is still on England.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>13th over: Middlesex 58-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 19, Malan 11)</strong> Samit Patel is on now, having looked so impressively streetwise with the ball against South Africa, and hurries through his first over for four runs. So Middlesex need 64 from seven overs.</p> <p>\"England will need to get Malan out, as he has the bat speed and imagination to score at 125 per 100 balls on any pitch,\" says Gary Naylor. \"His century in the T20 quarter-final was Gilchristian - it really was that good. His numbers in first-class cricket are ordinary, but the lad is a giant talent.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>14th over: Middlesex 68-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 19, Malan 20)</strong> Malan dances towards leg so as to drive Pietersen's first ball up and over the covers for two. Then, two balls later, he dances to leg again and creams Pietersen for the most magnificently clean straight six - a shot which, I believe, was used a lot in that epic innings against Lancashire mentioned by Naylor in the previous over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>15th over: Middlesex 73-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 23, Malan 22)</strong> There goes Malan again, but I think Patel saw it coming and fired it down even quicker, so Malan could only drag it into the leg side for a single. It's a good battle, this, and Joyce is obviously trying to take a single every ball to get Malan on strike. Five from the over, and Middlesex need 49 from 30 balls.</p> <p>\"Is it me,\" says Lee Calvert, \"or does Shaun Udal look like he could feasibly be Paul Collingwood's dad?\" Racist.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>16th over: Middlesex 81-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 30, Malan 22)</strong> So much for Joyce dealing in singles: he charges Pietersen's second ball and swats it for a clean, flattish six. But Pietersen does well to concede only two further runs - he ends with figures of 4-0-27-0 - so that means Middlesex need 41 from four overs.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>17th over: Middlesex 89-3 (chasing 122; Joyce 32, Malan 28)</strong> One thing I really don't like is that, on the Sky scorecard for bowling figures, they've removed maidens. So it's just overs, runs and wickets. The little things, folks, the little things - <em>AND THEN THE BIG ONES WHEN THEY RUIN TEST CRICKET FOREVER THE *$EW\u00a3$\u00a3()$*(E*!W()!!!!</em>.</p> <p>Back to the cricket, and Malan again backs to leg and this time smashes Patel through the hands of Bell at extra-cover for four. It's another dropped catch, technically. Eight more from the over leaves them needing 33 from three. Malan has done really well and, to back up Naylor's point, is the only man going at more than 125 runs per 100 balls in the match.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>18th over: Middlesex 95-3 (need 27 from 12 balls; Joyce 34, Malan 32)</strong> Two of the last three overs will be bowled by Flintoff, which could be decisive. His first three deliveries bring only singles, the second of which brings up the fifty partnership; the fourth is squeezed past backward point for two by Malan; the fifth is a dot ball, a full-toss slapped on the half-volley to Collingwood at backward point; and the sixth squeezed for a single. Six from the over, which is outstanding stuff. Middlesex need 27 from two overs.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Middlesex 104-4 (Joyce c Bell b Anderson 34)</strong> Pietersen gives the penultimate over to Anderson rather than Patel. Shades of Nasser Hussain giving the penultimate over, fatally, to Anderson rather than Caddick in Port Elizabeth against Australia at the 2003 World Cup.</p> <p>It looks like there will be a happier ending this time. After Malan pilfers two boundaries, Joyce drives the final delivery to long-off.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>19th over: Middlesex 104-4 (need 18 from 6 balls; Malan 40, Dexter 0)</strong> So Middlesex need 18 from the last over, bowled by Andrew Flintoff. Yeah, good luck with that.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>20th over: Middlesex 109-4: ENGLAND WIN BY 12 RUNS</strong> Middlesex can only take five from Flintoff's final over, so it's job done for England. They will pleased with the victory and the fact that there were made to work for it. The bowling was pr-etty good, the batting pr-etty bad, the fielding a joke that never got boring. They might wish they'd included Dawid Malan, whose fleet-footed 41 not out was the innings of the match in difficult circumstances. See you tomorrow for Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Middlesex, when they're playing for <em>real money</em>. Thanks for all your emails; goodnight.</p>",
  "<p>In the sadly execrable season five of the once mighty Peep Show, one of the few funny riffs involves the sexually hapless lead Mark Corrigan internally hailing every new female he meets as \"The One\". The problem is that even that recurring joke shows that the show has lost touch with the reality that it once so brutally conveyed. In real life, someone who had been let down as often as Corrigan (and yeah, we know he cancelled the wedding, but still) would be much more backwards about coming forwards with such a perception, even to themselves. <br> It's a decent rule of thumb that, the more someone's heart is broken, the more cagey they become: once bitten, thrice shy, and so on. All of which explains the Liverpool fans' almost eerily pragmatic response to their side's outstanding start to the season, which went up a level today when they ended Chelsea's 86-match unbeaten run at home in the league with a performance of the coolest authority. In the 18 years since Liverpool's last championship, their fans have endured too many rejections to expose themselves again at this stage of the season. Umpteen first dates have gone well, or so they thought, only for a second to never materialise. A few medium-length relationships (1990-91, 1996-97, 2001-02) also ultimately faded away. No wonder they are not crowing yet.</p> <p>This is not, nonetheless, something we are used to from football fans. \"And now you're gonna believe us, we're gonna win the league\" is often sung absurdly prematurely, to be scoffed at by neutrals, but this time there is a role reversal: those of an impartial nature feel that Liverpool look the real deal, but the fans will not \u2013 externally at least, and probably not internally for fear of imposing some kind of hex \u2013 admit as much. They really are taking it one game at a time.<br> Yet the evidence that this is a serious side becomes harder to ignore. It's impossible to overstate the symbolism of today's victory. Already they have won four league games after going behind, and today they knocked off a number of records: their first league goal at Stamford Bridge since Bruno Cheyrou in January 2004, first win away at any of the big four in the league under Rafa Ben\u00edtez and, of course, first side to win in the league at Stamford Bridge since Arsenal's Invincibles on February 21 2004. It seems 21 is today's magic number: this was, staggeringly, Ben\u00edtez's 21st game against Chelsea in four-and-a-bit seasons. History might just record it as Liverpool's coming of age. In a sense, talk of Liverpool's capacity to win the title is a red herring. After so often shooting their bolt by December, all they want for Christmas is a title challenge - and then the same for Easter. From there, anything can happen. Never has the prospect of a squeaky bum seemed so enticing.  For now, they will happy to have passed football's ultimate test. There were no surprises in selection or formation, a reflection of how comfortable both sides are in their skin at the moment. This is particularly relevant for Liverpool, who have previously relied on bespoke systems to beat Chelsea in particular in cup competitions. This time, tellingly, they did a number on Chelsea by using a familiar, repeatable formation. Both had triangles in midfield, but the fact that Liverpool's had a defensive base and Chelsea an attacking one meant that the two locked into each other early on, before Xabi Alonso's lucky goal loosened the game tactically and expunged the memory of the harsh yellow card on this ground in 2005, which ruled him out of the second leg of the European Cup semi-final. That goal could easily have prompted Liverpool, often so negative under Ben\u00edtez, to hold what they had, but they did quite the opposite. When you are a goal up away from home, it takes mental strength to maintain a 4-2-3-1 shape rather than allow it to slip naturally into 4-5-1, but Liverpool did so. Steven Gerrard crucially ensured there was never a prohibitive space between him and the front man, Robbie Keane. It was the same at the back. The space between the two centre-halves, Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger, and the two deep-lying midfielders, Alonso and Javier Mascherano, was generally gossamer-thin, which served to close the pocket in which Deco usually does such damage. Only once in the first-half did he get free, crunching a left-footer just wide in the 37th minute. Liverpool's compact shape allowed Chelsea more space on the flanks, particularly for their chalk-and-chalk (and chalk-gathering) full-backs, Ashley Cole and Jose Bosingwa. Liverpool trusted that, without Didier Drogba, they could handle any balls from wide areas, and so it proved. They were helped by the surprising reticence of the usually irrepressible Bosingwa, who was possibly conscious of the considerable threat of the excellent Albert Riera. The positive intentions of Liverpool survived the first 10 minutes of the second half, a crucial time in any match where the away side lead at half-time. This period is like a pre-fight weigh-in, with everyone looking for telltale signs in the body language, and it is a natural inclination for the away side to sit deeper and stiffen the body for the oncoming assault rather than relax and keep on playing. Liverpool did the latter, and as a result Chelsea showed surprising touches of self-doubt. They missed the remorselessness and self-belief of Michael Essien and Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba and even Joe Cole, who is so much tougher mentally than some people realise. The front three of Florent Malouda, Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou were varying shades of pathetic. Despite that, they were the best options and Luiz Felipe Scolari \u2013 despite always being one to make aggressive substitutions, such as Helder Postiga for Luis Figo in the Euro 2004 quarter-final \u2013 arguably lost his nerve when he switched to 4-4-2 within the first 15 minutes of the second half. With the exception of Avram Grant's switch to 4-4-2 at 1-0 down against Arsenal in March, Chelsea's strength in these situations has been to keep knocking on the door, to trust an approach that works 99 times out of 100 (or 86 out of 86). But now they lost their shape and, apart from a hideous slice from Cole eight yards out, went down with a barely fathomable impotence.  For that, Liverpool, so serene and certain in defence, deserve much credit. At the end, their fans settled for a song that has served them through thick and thin \u2013 You'll Never Walk Alone \u2013 but, if they are still top in March, they might accept that it's time to sing a different, more triumphalist song.</p>",
  "<p>David Frum has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302081_2.html\">an interesting piece</a> in the Wash Post this morning in which he says let's face it, it's over, and the GOP should basically give on McCain and salvage what it can:</p> <blockquote> <p>What should Republicans be doing differently? Two things: </p> <p>1. Every available dollar that can be shifted to a senatorial campaign must be shifted to a senatorial campaign. Right now, we are investing heavily in Pennsylvania in hopes of corralling those fabled \"Hillary Democrats\" for McCain. But McCain's hopes in Pennsylvania are delusive: The state went for Kerry in 2004, Gore in 2000 and Clinton in 1992 and 1996, and McCain lags Obama by a dozen points in recent polls. But even if we were somehow to take the state, that victory would not compensate for the likely loss of Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and other states tipped to the Democrats by demographic changes and the mortgage crisis. The \"win Pennsylvania and win the nation\" strategy may have looked plausible in August and September, when McCain trailed Obama by just a few digits. Now it looks far-fetched. </p> <p>But it is not far-fetched to hope that we can hold 45 or 46 of our current 49 Senate seats. In 1993, then-Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) stopped Hillary-care with only 43 seats. But if we are reduced to just 40 or 41 senators, as could easily happen, Republicans and conservatives would find themselves powerless to stop anything -- and more conservative Democrats would lose bargaining power with the Obama White House. </p> <p>2. We need a message change that frankly acknowledges that the Democrats are probably going to win the White House -- and that warns of the dangers of one-party, left-wing government. There's a lot of poll evidence that voters prefer divided government. By some estimates, perhaps as many as 8 percent of voters consciously cast strategic votes in favor of division. These are the voters we need to be talking to now. </p> <p>I'm not suggesting that the RNC throw up its hands. But down-ballot Republicans need to give up on the happy talk about how McCain has Obama just where he wants him, take off their game faces and say something like this: </p> <p>\"We're almost certainly looking at a Democratic White House. I can work with a Democratic president to help this state. But we need balance in Washington. </p> <p>\"The government now owns a big stake in the nation's banking system. Trillions of dollars are now under direct government control. It's not wise to put that money under one-party control. It's just too tempting. You need a second set of eyes on that cash. You need oversight and accountability. Otherwise, you're going to wake up two years from now and find out that a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House have been funneling a ton of that money to their friends and allies. It'll be a big scandal -- but it will be too late. The money will be gone. Divided government is the best precaution you can have.\" </p> <p>It's the only argument we have left. And, as the old Washington saying goes, it has the additional merit of being true. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>I think this makes sense. But what's interesting is that one could of course make the divided government argument an argument for McCain. That is, \"You know the Democrats are going to control Congress, so let's elect a Republican president to have balance.\" In fact some conservatives still thumping the tub for McCain are making just this argument. </p> <p>So it's interesting that Frum takes it in exactly the opposite direction. It's almost like he (and a few others) want McCain to lose so they can have the intra-party argument and showdown that they've been itching to have for a little while now anyway (Frum wrote a book last year, which I reviewed more positively than not in the New York Review, arguing that the GOP needs to give itself a major facelift).</p> <p>I think he's probably on to something that could help a few GOP Senate candidates keep or win their seats.<br></p>",
  "<p>Gerhard Schr\u00f6der declared 10 years ago, during the Third Way and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">New Labour</a> honeymoon, that \"economic policy is neither left not right. It is either good or bad\". Ten years later, we are allowed to conclude that this was a self-fulfilling prophecy. When he made his declaration, 11 out of 15 governments of the then European Union were run by socialists. Now, election after election, country after country, the left is elbowed out from positions of power. In the course of the last decade, social-democratic parties have presided over the economic policy of privatisation of gains and nationalisation of losses. They ran states preoccupied with deregulation, privatisation and individualisation. </p> <p>At the end of the New Labour decade, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> leads the all-European effort to mobilise the taxpayers into the campaign to recapitalise the capitalist economy, saving it from the consequences of its own greed and inbuilt suicidal tendency. There is almost nothing left to distinguish left from right in economic, or any other, policy. <br> And there is no distinctly left vision or credible program that would appeal to the imagination of electors and convince them that good economic policy may be synonymous with left economic policy. Following the line of Third Way thinking, to be left meant to be able to do more thoroughly the job that the right demands to be done but fails to do properly. It was Tony Blair's New Labour that laid institutional foundations under Margaret Thatcher inchoate ideas of \"there is no society, only individuals and families\". It was the French Socialist Party that did most for the dismantling of the French social state. And as to the post-communist parties in east-central Europe, renamed as social democrats, they are the most enthusiastic and vociferous advocates and most consistent practitioners of unlimited freedom for the rich and leaving the poor to their own care.</p> <p>Over more than a century, the distinctive mark of the left was to believe that it is the sacrosanct duty of community to care for and to assist all its members, collectively, against the powerful forces they are unable to fight alone. Social-democratic hopes to perform that task used to be invested in the modern state, powerful and ambitious enough to limit the damage perpetuated by the free play of the markets by forcing the economic interests to respect the political will of the nation and the ethical principles of national community. But nation states are no longer as powerful as they used to be or hoped to become. The political states once claiming full military, economic and cultural sovereignty over their territory and its population are no longer sovereign in any of those aspects of common life. </p> <p>Genuine powers, the powers that decide the range of life options and life chances of most of our contemporaries, have evaporated from the nation state into the global space, where they float free from political control: politics has remained as local as before and therefore is no longer able to reach them, let alone to constrain. One of the effects of globalisation is the divorce between power (the capacity to have things done) and politics. We have now power freed from politics in the global space, and politics deprived of power in the local space.</p> <p>That development left the socialists without the crucial (the only?) instrument intended to be used in the implementation of their project. Simply, a social state guaranteeing existential security to all can no longer be constructed, nor survive, in the framework of the nation state (the forces that would have to be tamed for that purpose are not in the nation state command). Attempts to use the weakened state for that purpose were in most cases foiled under the pressure of exterritorial, global economic forces or the markets. </p> <p>Increasingly, social democrats revealed their sudden inability to deliver on their promise. Hence the desperate effort to find another trademark and legitimation. The Italian Democratic Party or for that matter the Polish Left and Democrats, exemplify the destination to which that search leads: total absence of trademark and legitimation. In this form, the distant offspring of the old left can count only on the failures of their adversaries as their sole electoral chance, and on the disaffected and angry victims of those failures as their only electoral constituency. </p> <p>The first collateral casualty was the issue of existential security. That past jewel in the left's crown has been dropped by the parties wrongly called left; it now lies, so to speak, on the street \u2013 from which it has been promptly picked up by forces equally wrongly called right. The Italian Lega is now promising to restore the existential security \u2013 which the Democratic Party promises to further undermine by more deregulation of capital and trade markets and more flexibility of the labour market, and by a yet wider opening of the country doors to the mysterious, unpredictable and uncontrollable global forces. </p> <p>Only, fraudulently, it interprets the causes of existential insecurity differently from the left of the past: not as a product of the capitalist free-for-all (freedom for the high and mighty, impotence for the lowly and resourceless), but as the outcome of the well-off Lombardians needing to share their wealth with indolent Calabrians or Sicilians and of the need, common to them all, to share their means of living with foreigners. They forget that the immigration of millions of ancestors of the 21st century Italians to the US and Latin America enormously contributed to their present riches. </p> <p><em>After New Labour, the second debate in the Who owns the progressive future series, organised by Comment is free and Soundings magazine, will be held in London at <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/\">Kings Place</a> on November 3 at 7pm.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Two teams of football players (and an official):</strong> </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><br><strong>West Ham:</strong> Green, Faubert, Collins, Upson, Ilunga, Mullins, Parker, Bowyer, Di Michele, Bellamy, Cole. Subs: Lastuvka, Lopez, Etherington, Boa Morte, Davenport, Collison, Sears. </p> <p><strong>Arsenal: </strong>Almunia, Eboue, Gallas, Silvestre, Clichy, Walcott, Fabregas, Song Billong, Nasri, Bendtner, Van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Diaby, Sagna, Toure, Ramsey, Djourou, Adebayor.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Afternoon all. </strong>While the easily-amused are all focusing on the continuing circus up at White Hart Lane, Tottenham - and Harry Redknapp's - new neighbours Arsenal have gone eastward to his former stomping ground West Ham. </p> <p>Redknapp used to run this place as though it was a youth club, signing players like Marco Boogers, Florin Raducioiu and Samassi Abou, loosely assembling them into a slightly-orchestrated rabble and sending them out to see what happened. Defeat, usually, sometimes by massive margins.</p> <p>Things have changed for the better all around, of course, and the monotone of Alan Curbishley was replaced earlier this season by the jinking Italian Gianfranco Zola, to give West Ham a touch of the exotic. It hasn't necessarily worked: they've lost to West Brom, Bolton and Hull, despite beating Wigan, Blackburn, Newcastle and Fulham. But the good times are sort of back in East London.</p> <p>Hull, of course, also beat Arsenal at the Emirates a couple of weeks back, all the more surprising since Arsene Wenger's side has been looking characteristically fluent this season. Although few can expect them to cling onto the coat-tails of the likes of Hull, they can go four points clear of Manchester United in fourth place if they win here.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>West Ham haven't kept a clean sheet all season.</strong> And Lucas Neill has dropped out of today's line-up. You do the math. James Collins returns for West Ham and Di Michele is in the midfield.</p> <p><strong>For Arsenal</strong>, Adebayor is rested from the starting line-up with Nicklas Bendtner coming in. Alexandre Song replaces Denilson in midfield, even though the Brazilian had played every Premier League match of the season so far.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Mac Millings is already in the inbox, but seems to be concerned with everything except what's going on here: \"I was just over at the Live Scoreboard,\" says Mac. \"It's still strange seeing Manchester City ahead with Robinho as the scorer. Not as weird as seeing Spurs 1-0 (Pavlyuchenko), though.\" Other football matches are available.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Arsenal get things under-way, with their new-look front line of Bendtner and van Persie. But it's another relatively unfamiliar face who gets on the end of their first flowing move: Song finding some space in the Hammers' box and firing a shot at Green.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 mins:</strong> This is end to end stuff! On the match's second move, West Ham force Gallas to shepherd the ball back to Manuel Almunia.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 mins:</strong> Carlton Cole spins away from his marker in the middle of Arsenal's half and powers towards the edge of the box. The Arsenal back-line stand firm, Cole is forced to square to Bellamy and that's the end of that one. At the other end, Fabregas floats a long ball onto the penalty spot where Upson tangles with Van Persie. The ball goes behind, but Upson may have impeded the Dutch striker.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Nasri is playing wide on the left against a narrow West Ham and gets in a cross that Collins stretches for and scrambles clear. Fabregas and Nasri jink and dink in the middle of the pitch, but West Ham remain unimpressed and get it clear - for a moment or two.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> West Ham have started here like they're the away side, leaving Cole up front alone and finding him when they break down the Arsenal attacks. Cole is big and strong but has been outwitted a couple of times by Gallas and any danger evaporates.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 mins: </strong>Cole goes crumpling to the turf on the left edge of the Arsenal box, cries out, winces, then gets up again when no free kick is given. But <em>that</em>'s better: Van Persie is caught in possession in his own half and the ball falls for Di Michele, who lets fly from 25 yards. It's rising but Almunia is still forced to push it over his bar. Oh, and Man City have just gone 2-0 up, with Robinho scoring again.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> The game is settling more now, with Arsenal, surprisingly, happy to take the sting out of things. Fabregas takes his time in the middle of the pitch, finding a darting lateral run from Bendtner. The Dane finds space and shoots from outside the box, dragged wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins:</strong> Craig Bellamy, who surely could have a brilliant career in MLS if the success of his twin Darren Huckerby is anything to go by, probably interests the scouts by blazing over from 30 yards.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 mins:</strong> Here's how this one's going so far: Arsenal are stroking it around the middle of the pitch confidently enough, with the final ball cut out. West Ham are stroking it around the middle of the pitch a little less confidently, but confidently enough, but are rushing their passes or shots in the final third and nothing is coming of that either.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> I don't know anything about this Di Michele character, except for the fact that he's the standout player in this match so far. Most recently, he pops up on the left, cuts a cross back to Cole, whose feet for a big man aren't as good as the feet of most big men who have feet that are surprisingly good for a biug man, and he stumbles over it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Di Michele is once again the furthest forward, but again can feed Cole. At the other end, Arsenal finally find their zip as Walcott takes it outside the narrow left back, finds himself whizzing into the box and unleashes a rising drive that Green tips over. Bendtner was in acres of space in the middle and should perhaps have been picked out by the England winger.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> It's a rainy afternoon and a largely indifferent start to a largely indifferent match and minute-by-minute. Praise be to Gary Naylor and his encyclopaedic memory of things that really aren't worth remembering, except in these precise moments: \"Readers of a certain age may remember The Numskulls who appeared in various British comics,\" begins Naylor. \"The set-up was that they lived inside a boy's head all working away to control his movement and senses. Everyone knew their role and discharged it efficiently. They were also fit for their particular purpose, some small and quick, others larger. Due to their efforts, the machine (boy) worked. Those Numskulls remind me of Arsenal - and like Arsenal, the strip wasn't quite as interesting or successful as it might have been.\" Pick the bones out of that.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> A moment of madness from Robert Green goes unpunished by a dawling linesman. A long ball is plucked out the air by the keeper, standing two yards outside the box. He's clearly out of his territory but the linesman is miles behind the play and somehow he gets away with it.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Three things happen in quick succession: my screen goes blank, Arsenal have a good chance from a corner, Cesc Fabregas is booked. The first of those things renders it difficult to fill in much about the second two.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Great save from Almunia keeps the scores even. Scott Parker finds room in the middle, spins and sets Bellamy scampering through the middle, showing a clean pair of heels to the Arsenal defence. He angles his shot across Almunia, but he sticks out a leg and rebounds it over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 mins: </strong>After now seeing a replay, Parker's ball to set Bellamy through was even better than it first appeared. He received a pass inside his own half as he was just toppling off-balance. But before he hit the deck, he managed pne glance and one touch into the path of the galloping Bellamy. Bendtner goes close here; Robinho gets his hat-trick and Gary Naylor finds another one from his rainy day collection: \"Can the multinational readership of the MBM tell us determinedly monolingual Brits what footballers' names mean in their native tongues? Holzenbein, late of West Germany, famously translated as \"wooden leg\" and as for Bastien Schweinsteiger, well let's not. I'm guessing here, but does Gallas mean \"Gauloises smoker\" and Bentdner mean \"as out of place as Serginho in the 1982 Brazil team\"?\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>34 mins: </strong>Upton Park is rocking as West Ham scent that they might be able to beat a strangely lethargic Arsenal here. They flood forward but Bellamy's final ball lets him down - in that he gives it straight to a couple of ambling defenders.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Eboue shimmies down the right but crosses into the arms of Green. On the other side of the West Ham box, Bendtner turns this way and that before getting a far more effective shot. Green dives to his left and pushes it, one handed, round the post.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>38 mins:</strong> Scott Parker snaffles out the most recent danger from the lively Bendtner, who spends just too long on the ball on the edge of the box and allows the energetic midfielder to clatter it away.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>40 mins:</strong> Van Persie wastes a free kick in a decent position, when he attempts to float it onto the spot but doesn't clear the first man. It's especially dangerous because the big men are up from the back and West Ham break at pace. It's two-versus-two for a moment, but the profligate Bellamy again passes poorly to the feet of an opponent.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>41 mins: </strong>Now Bellamy hammers one way over the bar after being teed up by Parker and then Cole.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Parker finally takes it too far and goes into the book for clattering through the back of an Arsenal midfielder, who was flattened so quickly I didn't even get to see his face. That's a yellow card for Parker, and a poor free kick from Fabregas who also hits it too flat into the box and allows West Ham to clear.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 mins:</strong> Ilunga finds himself further forward than at any previous time and swings in a dangerous cross from the left, low and right between Almunia and the encroaching Carlton Cole. They both go for it, as entitled, and although the keeper comes away with it, he also gets a smack in the ribs from the striker's boots.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45+1 mins: </strong>\"Can everyone ignore Gary Naylor's request, please?\" says Tony, redundantly. \"I was happy to think his [Schweinsteiger's] name meant 'Pigsticker' until some clever clogs explained it was something too boring to remember.\" To be honest Tony, everyone is ignoring everything this afternoon: my inbox is hardly what you'd call creaking. Half-time.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Strangely overlooked during the actualy match narrative, the peculiar moment featuring Robert Green (24 mins) dominates the half-time discussions. The West Ham keeper was definitely a yard out of his box when he caught a long through-ball and might well be having an early bath right now. Instead, he's pulled off a couple of good saves and will join 10 colleagues for the second half fancying they might get something out of this.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time tattle:</strong> \"Tony may be incurious,\" laments Gary Naylor. \"But I've been doing some research on footballers' names. \"Fabregas\" is Catalan for \"being on the way to Barcelona\", \"Robinho\" is Portuguese for \"a Brazilian who will change places with an Argentine, yet stay in the same city\", \"Eboue\" is French for \"not good enough to win anything\".\" Meanwhile, Mac Millings is speaking in puns: \"I don't know much about the meaning of footballers' names (31 min) but I do know that Matthew Upson's dad's first name is Get, named after what Roy Keane probably didn't say to Alf-Inge Haaland.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> West Ham fans are singing \"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\". I'm holding back my thoughts on that. They're off again at Upton Park with no half-time changes.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> I <em>think</em> Faubert just had a shot from about 75 yards. Seriously. Surprisingly, it didn't beat Almunia, who was off his line.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Nasri has been quiet - as has most of the Arsenal midfield in truth - and here he manages to squeeze between Faubert and Bellamy but pass it straight where all of his colleagues aren't, and West Ham clear. Soon after a neat, tight exchange of give and goes, involving Nasri, earn a corner for Arsenal, that Walcott heads over.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 mins:</strong> A comedic misunderstanding from Gallas and Almuniua ends with the captain kicking the ball behind the goal for a corner, under no pressure. The corner bounces off Upson but is safe.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> Clichy picks up a booking for going sliding in the middle of the pitch where otherwise there was no danger. The resulting free kick again finds a West Ham head - Cole's I think - but his header is soft and comfortably dealt with.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>53 mins:</strong> Everyone's at this bicycle kick game these days, but Bendtner probably shouldn't and he skies one closer to the Arctic than the West Ham goal. A fizzed cross moments later is dangerously chipped over his own bar by Upson; a decent clearance rather than shocking howler.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> Penalty shout for West Ham as Cole crosses from the left and it maybe hits an arm, maybe not, but I can't make a judgment because I'm reading this, from Katja Leistenschneider: \"Schweinsteiger actually translates into \"pig mounter\". That's still boring, though - at least for those of us whose fantasy level is about as high as the quality of the match.\" But what does Leistenschneider mean?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>57 mins: </strong>Collins and Van Persie challenge for the ball in the West Ham six-yard box and the Dutchman is muscled out of it, going down clutching his knee. He's not permanently damaged and the danger is cleared. Then, up the other end, there are two speculative penalty shouts - both for handball, neither given - before Arsenal break again and Van Persie attempts to wriggle past four players to get a shot in. He can't, but the match is suddenly alive. Alex Song is booked.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>60 mins:</strong> Now the clocks have gone back and everything, this suddenly feels like one of those old-school top-flight matches, played on a boggy, freezing pitch in the middle of winter. It's gloomy out there, even if it's not too cold or boggy, but it's also now a full-blooded end-to-end encounter, with some desperate lunges going in to stop promising breaks. The last half-hour should be fun.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>63 mins:</strong> West Ham seem to want this a bit more than Arsenal, but Arsenal seem still to have more quality and seem more likely to snatch it. Scott Parker crumples to the turf on the half way line, apparently damaging an ankle when Nasri collapses on top of him. He hobbles off for more treatment.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Scrappy stuff in the West Ham box with desperate defenders throwing themselves in the way of shots from Fabregas and then Song. Arsenal win a corner as Wenger replaces Nasri and Walcott with Diaby and Adebayor. And the latter's first touch is almost a goal: he jumps highest and gets onto the corner, but heads wide. \"What is it about this Arsenal side that makes one constantly uneasy?\" wonders Amir Adhamy. \"Compare Bentdner to Bergkamp, Song to Vieira... I'm worried. We get more and more lightweight every year.\" I'm not sure they're really fair comparisons, Amir. The two you mention are two of the all-time greats. But I reckon you've answered the first part of your question yourself. \"By the way, I have food poisoning, so am experiencing this game under the duress of sickness.\" There you go.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>69 mins:</strong> Arsenal are turning the screw here now and have pegged back West Ham into their own box. With or without Bergkamp and Vieira, Arsenal are hugely dangerous when they're camped on the edge of the area, and West Ham could be in trouble here. They concede a corner off Collins and then - thump - Van Persie dances across to the middle from the right and unleashes an all mighty thunderbolt that Green, diving left, does exceptionally well to palm out.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> It is all Arsenal and - thump - Van Persie sizes up a free kick from 28 yards and thunders it past Green but onto the post! You can't get much closer than that.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 mins - Goal! West Ham 0-1 Arsenal</strong><br>You can't say that wasn't coming. The sustained pressure from Arsenal finally unsettles Faubert, who diverts an Adebayor cross/shot past his own keeper from three yards. Green has kept them in it thus far, but after Adebayor evades the attention of three defenders he's able to scuff that shot goalward. It's going wide, but Faubert sticks his foot out to stop it reaching Bendtner, and in it goes.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>77 mins:</strong>Luis Boa Morte comes on to replace Scott Parker, Matthew Etherington is on for Di Michele. West Ham kick off, finally.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> Arsenal now seem happy to take the sting out of the match by playing those casual passes around the midfield. But a loose one from Diaby sets Bellamy ascamper, and he stumbles over in the box. No foul.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Still Green stands firm against the Arsenal onslaught, and this one would have been a cracker but for the England goalkeeper. Bendtner is free down the left, he cuts it back to Adebayor who, full throttle, takes it away from the defender and thwacks one goalward. Green, full length to his right, parries, and Adebayor puts the rebound over.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 mins: </strong>Faubert clatters into Bendtner and Arsenal have a free kick wide on the left. It's lifted in, across, and over the box and goes safe.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 mins:</strong> Collins has a much better chance for West Ham than he seemed to first realise. It drops to him on the edge of the box after a long ball is flicked on. Completely unimpeded, he has the time to take it down and drill it past Almunia, but instead decides to slash rashly at it and send it into row X.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> West Ham haven't had many gilt-edged chances here despite Arsenal playing somewhat below par. What's that about winning matches when not playing well? Yeah, that. Faubert is now booked for taking his frustrations out on Bendtner, who has been his tormentor for much of the afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 mins:</strong> West Ham have a free kick wide left, just inside the Arsenal box. Shortly before it's taken, the 11-year-old Freddie Sears jogs on to replace the anonymous Lee Bowyer, and the kick is pinged hard into the area. An Arsenal head clears behind, and Bellamy's corner is wasted.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Three minute of injury time start with Sears having a shot charged down but Aresenal go straight up the other end and...</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 mins+2: GOAL! West Ham 0-2 Arsenal (Adebayor)</strong> As West Ham send everyone forward, a 70-yard ball from the left-back spot (Fabregas-esque, if not actually by Fabregas) picks out Adebayor. He takes it past Green, who sprints out, and fires it in to win the match.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90 mins+3: Red card: Carlton Cole</strong><br>Still enough time for Cole to be sent off, a straight red - an exceptionally harsh decision from Phil Dowd. Cole slides in slightly late on Song, but it's not in any way malicious, not even dangerous, and the sending off (plus three-match ban) is scarcely warranted.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Full time:</strong> The referee Phil Dowd gets a mouthful of abuse from the West Ham bench for the late red card, but Arsenal run out 2-0 victors in east London, and go to within one point of the top. That's it from here. Thanks for your emails. Bye!</p>",
  "<p>Australia flexed their muscles ominously to record a comfortable opening World Cup victory over New Zealand inspired by a courageous personal performance from Jonathan Thurston.</p> <p>The North Queensland Cowboys scrum half had been expected to withdraw from the match after his uncle was killed in a vicious beating incident in Brisbane on Friday. But Thurston turned down the option of withdrawing from the squad and revived his State of Origin half-back combination with the veteran Kangaroos captain Darren Lockyer to pull a hugely disappointing Kiwi side to pieces. </p> <p>A third Queenslander, the hulking former Melbourne Storm centre Israel Folau, scored two of Australia's five tries after Greg Inglis had followed an early Thurston penalty with a typically classy effort in the 14th minute.</p> <p>But both Australia and New Zealand did pick up one worry for the rest of the tournament. The Kangaroos lost the wing Brent Tate with a serious concussion that must make him doubtful for next Sunday's game against England in Melbourne, while New Zealand's fiery centre Steve Matai was put on report for alleged use of his elbow shortly before Inglis's try - meaning he is likely to face a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday.</p> <p>Australia produced some sparkling moments but it was a largely low-key match in front of a crowd of 34,157 that exceeded the expectations of tournament organisers, with the depressing sight of Mexican waves rippling around the stadium after the Kiwis challenge had fizzled out early in the second half. </p> <p>They threatened to provide a much tighter contest when a strong drive from the interchange forward Sam Rapira put them on the front foot and the stand-off Benji Marshall capitalised to send Sika Manu charging through a weak attempted tackle by Josh Perry, Matai converting to cut the deficit to 8-6.</p> <p>But Jerome Ropati's unforced error on the next set of six handed Australia an immediate chance to regain control which they took with a slick handling move instigated by the Thurston-Lockyer combination before Billy Slater sent Joel Monaghan over in the left corner. Thurston added his second excellent conversion.</p> <p>Folau's first try removed any doubt about the outcome early in the second half before an elusive run by Thurston laid on a try for Slater, with Folau's second in the closing stages sealing a victory that was every bit as comfortable as the scoreline suggests.</p> <p>\"It was our first game and we wanted to show our opponents that we're serious,\" said Australia's coach Ricky Stuart. \"The players transferred their preparation to the match really well. A lot of extra work went into the combinations and fluency around the ruck and they were fast and skilful. We want to keep improving. We're always vulnerable because we're carrying the favourites' tag. We have to be at our best at the back end of the campaign.\"</p> <p>Australia will now be strong favourites to do a similar job on England at the Telstra Dome next week and reinforce their status as overwhelming favourites to win a seventh straight World Cup, while New Zealand are determined to overcome their one-sided defeat against Papua New Guinea on the Gold Coast on Saturday - although that will not necessarily be easy, at least on the evidence of Saturday's game in Townsville.</p> <p>\"We are very disappointed, given the anticipation and the wonderful crowd,\" said the Kiwis' coach Stephen Kearney. \"They put us under pressure and we couldn't respond. But we're not chucking in the towel. It was the first game for us against real opposition. We needed an indication of where we're at and we need some improvement.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are moments in every cyclist's life where one grips the handlebars tight and prays. The whine from the engine behind is alarming and you can discern the motorist's haste \u2013 and distaste for your presence. As you focus on keeping your position centimetres from the kerb there's little else you can do sometimes but pray. Sadly, prayers aren't always enough. </p> <p>Accidents happen, of course. Neither cyclists nor motorists are blameless. But cyclists, unlike motorists, are extremely vulnerable in any collision. Last week, sadly, was testament to that. On Monday, a 16-year-old cyclist was killed at a busy junction in Tooting, south London. The following day, there were two incidents involving young cyclists in Scotland. In Dundee, a 14-year-old boy died by the side of the road after a collision in rush-hour traffic. A second lad, aged nine, was also struck on Tuesday in Aberdeen and died from his injuries. </p> <p>In an ideal world, there would be separate lanes for cyclists. The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany lead the way here. However, this is only one factor in making the cycle option palatable. Driver awareness of cyclists' needs is crucial. The Highway Code's instruction to \"reduce your speed when \u2026 sharing the road with cyclists and \u2026 particularly children\" is routinely ignored. I'm regularly amazed, angered and frightened by vehicles passing me closely at speed. This fear deters many potential cyclists. I drive \u2013 in fact, I love driving \u2013 but I can't imagine encroaching on cyclists at speed. </p> <p>In the Netherlands, according to a Rutgers university <a href=\"http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/pucher/Irresistible.pdf\">study</a> (pdf), your chances of suffering a fatal bike crash are more than three times lower than in the UK. This is because, in addition to safer provision for bicycle riders, many motorists are themselves cyclists. They understand how vulnerable cyclists are. <a href=\"http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/9/3/205\">Evidence also indicates</a> that increased cycling levels lead to greater safety.</p> <p>There is another important factor at work in the Netherlands and in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and several others European countries. It's the principle of strict liability. This puts the onus of responsibility on drivers in civil compensation cases in the event of a collision \u2013 not on the cyclist or pedestrian as is the case here. It does not affect criminal cases. Furthermore, <a href=\"www.roadpeace.org/documents/Strict%20liability%20discussion%20paper.pdf\">as Roadpeace reports</a> (pdf), in several of these countries children and the elderly are deemed not liable for their actions in civil cases. As far as I can see, this is bound to focus drivers' minds.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/rsrr/theme1/childrensroadsafetyaninterna.pdf\">report</a> (pdf), published in 2004 and commissioned by the Department for Transport, highlighted strict liability as being a factor in the performance of countries with the best record on child road safety. And senior individuals within the department are known to favour the introduction of this legislation.</p> <p>There will be the detractors, like the irksome Matthew Parris (who <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/matthew_parris/article3097464.ece\">infamously penned</a> a Times column last year that called for decapitating cyclists). Such people feed the selfish view that motorists have to put up with pesky cyclists. But cyclists need the right to use the road without intimidation.</p>",
  "<p>I've often wondered why economics was labelled a \"dismal science\", and now I know. In most sciences, there's an element of mastery such that the more you know your subject, the better you get at it. But with economics, the reverse seems to be the case. Thus, while even though all of us lowest-common-denominator joe-schmoes have known that the economy has been heading for recession for some time, it's taken until this week for the news to reach both the governor of the Bank of England and the prime minister. When Brown's faithful replacement as chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/economy.alistairdarling\">called time</a> on growth way back in August, he was roundly criticised from every quarter. </p> <p>The problem, of course, is that because the science of economics is not only dismal but soft, the credibility of those whose power is rooted in economic analysis rests not on solid findings but on something like a credit scoring system. To the extent that they guess right, or gamble successfully, they build up credibility, or creditworthiness, and because no-one can hold anyone to account on the basis of the facts of the matter \u2013 because, by and large, there aren't any \u2013 then their credit rating is, again by and large, pretty much all they have. But in the case of figures like Brown and Mervyn King, there's so much credit invested in them by virtue of their position that they're left with few options but to oversell everything that they do announce, or \u2013 in cases such as the present one, where the bottom has fallen out of whole system \u2013 simply come clean after the fact in a kind of credibility correction. </p> <p>Now we're in this mess, of course, it doesn't help to have people like me poking fun at the whole thing, any more than it helps to have what Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins the other day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/15/credit-crunch-banking\">called</a> \"Guardian writers\" pretending that capitalism has eaten itself. Capitalism is more likely to eat us before it eats itself. </p> <p>But there is one interesting absence in the melee of commentary on the recession, which is that there don't seem to be any Marxists left to take a moral stand. You'd think, to continue the economics analogy, they'd stand to profit from the situation, buying up dirt-cheap political stock in what must surely be a bear market for anti-capitalist ideology. But while there has been slight increase of the visibility of Socialist Worker sellers amid the usual swarms of London Lites, of high profile told-you-so-ing there has been little sign. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/brendanoneill\">Brendan O'Neill</a> has kept quiet, perhaps preferring to cry for alms rather than arms.</p> <p>It has been said often enough, since the Soviet bloc crumbled into nothingness during the early 1990s, that Marxism has been thoroughly \"discredited\". Yet, in its absence, as the pragmatics of free-market capitalism have, in various guises, filled the ideological vacuum, I wonder if we don't miss it. By this I don't mean that we miss the Cold War \u2013 although it is clearly the case than many do \u2013 or that anyone should want to bring back Stalin. Rather, it is simply that, in the absence of any even weakly viable alternatives, the tenets of capitalism come to be presented as self-evident truths. </p> <p>But you don't need to be Marx's little brother to see that most of the central tenets are far from being self-evident. Indeed, the central idea of capital ownership \u2013 that you can, effectively, get money for nothing \u2013 is being roundly, and literally, discredited at this very moment. There's no such thing as a free lunch \u2013 at least not in a capitalist society \u2013 and there never will be. At the same time, the astonishingly pervasive myth that the acquisition of excessive wealth has ever made anyone any happier is as far from being grounded in anything resembling reality as ever. We're all \u2013 if Oliver James has it right \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/24/comment.politics\">simply sick</a> from it.</p> <p>For all its grim analysis and frequently turgid prose \u2013 not to mention the lack of allowance for the simple law that absolute power corrupts absolutely \u2013 Marxism was at least a system of political thought predicated on the idea of destroying inequality and, ultimately, creating a society whose citizens could be free not only of physical but of spiritual want. It at least held on to the hope, in other words, that man can improve his lot without taking for granted that this improvement must come at the expense of others. </p> <p>In capitalism, on the other hand, we have established a power base which answers to no rational authority but rather to the forces of \"the market\", a blind force which has none of the nobility of \"blind nature\" but which derives from the whim, unhinged thrill-seeking, naked greed and kneejerk fears of individuals who have traded in compassion for the illusion of power and wealth.</p> <p>If the masked ideology of capitalism contains anything that still counts as truth, it is that human nature directs us to oppose the status quo. Yet, sadly, it seems precisely to have been the forces of capitalism that keep us imprisoned in the status quo, taking what we already have and selling it back to us under the guise of change and progress. </p> <p>Surely, during the little break from rampant growth the next two years promise to offer us, some effort could be made to come up with some fresh ideas? Can't we put at least one tiny portion of that vast expanse of intellectual effort, presently consumed entirely by the effort to get something from nothing, to the task of getting something out of the realisation that it can't be done?</p>",

  "<p>Dear Supporter, </p> <p>How quickly things change in football. Our pre-season form, our start to the transfer window and early summer signings had everyone optimistic for the season ahead. The last few days of that window and our poor start to the season has seen all that change. This has been a difficult period for the Club and many questions are being asked and much criticism levelled. I should like to update you on some important developments announced a short while ago, to answer some of your questions and also to outline our thinking as we look to improve our current position going forward.</p> <p>We have faced many key challenges as we have progressed over the last few seasons and we have had to take important decisions at crucial times - without the wonderful benefit of hindsight and always under full public scrutiny. As such, they have been judgement calls. Some of our decisions and judgements may at times be unpopular with our fans but we always take decisions we believe to be in the best interests of our Club, at the time we make them, and for the right reasons. In many cases, it is simply not possible or practical for all of the factors involved to enter the public domain and I do understand that this can alter or impair the perception of why something has or hasn't been done.</p> <p>Today, as formally announced by the Club, I have made one such important judgement call and in doing so I have taken some very difficult decisions. Relieving Juande Ramos, our Head Coach, and Juande's assistants, Gus Poyet and Marcos Alvarez, of their posts is not something I have undertaken lightly.</p> <p>Unfortunately, our record of just three League wins since our memorable Carling Cup victory against Chelsea last February, combined with our extremely poor start to the season, led the Board and I to determine that significant change was necessary as a matter of urgency. We are grateful to Juande, Gus and Marcos for all their hard work - they are incredibly professional, committed individuals and I regret that their time in the Premier League has not gone as well as we had all hoped.</p> <p>The English Premier League is an unforgiving competition - time was no longer on our side and was a luxury we simply could not afford. We have quite clearly not performed to the best of our ability for many months now and our poor run of form is not something we could allow to continue unchecked.</p> <p>In appointing Harry Redknapp as our new manager, we are delighted to have secured the services of someone we have long since admired and whose track record and knowledge of all levels of football, including importantly the Premier League, is outstanding. I know Harry is relishing the opportunity of managing a Club he knows well, not least from his son Jamie's time here as a player and Captain, and of re-invigorating and restoring confidence to a squad of highly talented international players. With his great knowledge of the game and his excellent motivational skills, Harry has inspired his teams to consistently over-perform, whilst his preferred attacking style of playing the game sits comfortably with our Club's history, heritage and the type of entertaining football our fans want and expect to see.</p> <p>We have spent around \u00a3175m on new players over the last 3 years. The purchasing of players is a critical aspect of our Club and, given our current position, it is essential that we go into the January transfer window with absolute confidence in the advice being offered to the Board. Following a meeting of the Directors and a full review of our football management structure, I can also inform you that Damien Comolli has left the Club with immediate effect. Damien will not be directly replaced.</p> <p>In my opinion, and with the benefit that comes with running our Club with and without a Sporting Director in the past seven years, the successful management of a football club is not about structures or job titles. As in most businessess, it's about people: their personal qualities, their knowledge, their experience, their relationships, communication skills, interaction with colleagues, leadership and, of course, their ability.</p> <p>In Harry, we are also accepting with his appointment that now is the right time for us to move back to a more traditional style of football management at our Club. one which we believe will be capable of initiating our climb back up the Premier League table and to maintaining our challenge in the UEFA, Carling and FA Cup competitions.</p> <p>However, I should stress that we are not in this current position because of any single factor or any one individual. Human nature often dictates the need to find someone or something to blame, but in these circumstances we need all our energies to be directed instead to supporting the team and improving our League position. Nothing else matters at this time.</p> <p>That said, and without dwelling too much on last summer, I do also want to take this opportunity to address some of the other concerns you have raised. Many of the questions I have been asked and much of the reasoning for our poor start to the season has centred on our striker options. I do not believe this to be the sole reason, but I do feel it is important to set out the facts once again regarding the sale of two popular and talented strikers: Keane and Berbatov.</p> <p>Robbie Keane's departure was undoubtedly the shock of the summer. I personally had an excellent relationship with Robbie and he was one player that I always thought would end his career at the Club. I know you all felt the same. I was as disappointed as any of you when he informed me that he wanted to join what he described as his favourite boyhood club. Against this background and despite his obvious professionalism, our coaching staff felt that it would be very difficult to expect Robbie to continue to be such a positive influence in our dressing room when he so clearly wanted to leave us. The decision to sell Robbie was therefore not a financial one, although in such circumstances it was vital for our Club to secure the maximum possible value for a player of Robbie's ability.</p> <p>The sale of Dimitar was an entirely different matter. Dimitar first intimated to Martin Jol that he wanted to join Manchester United after just one season at our Club - and just 10 days before the end of the summer 2007 transfer window. At that time, the coaching staff's preference was to let Dimitar go and for us to replace him. This was not something I would allow - at any price - as I felt that Dimitar's request was completely unreasonable. From that moment on, we obviously knew we had an issue and we spent many hours over the course of the season that followed trying to persuade Dimitar to stay. I rebuffed a number of approaches from clubs , including Manchester United, this May and again in early July. Despite press stories to the contrary, there was no extended period of negotiation with Manchester United and their July offer of \u00a320m was not increased until they contacted us again in the last few days of the transfer window.</p> <p>The internal decision to sell Dimitar at the beginning of the window was premised on a suitable replacement being found and on the assumption that Dimitar couldn't be persuaded to change his mind. Under FIFA regulations, if a players signs a contract before his 28th birthday, he has only to serve 3 years of that contract before he can terminate it and join a new club. Whilst some compensation is payable under such circumstances the level of compensation is set by a third party body in accordance with predeteremined factors, and in Dimitar's case would have been but a small fraction of the fee we received from Manchester United. But even this was not the final determining factor in our decision to part company with him. Despite the potential cost to the Club and knowing that our efforts to sign an additional, experienced striker had failed, the final decision on whether or not to sell Dimitar was not a financial decision but a footballing one. It was felt that he had not been a positive influence on the pitch or in the dressing room and that this would continue.</p> <p>The timing of the actual transfer of Dimitar was completely immaterial and unconnected to our bringing in a replacement for him. We had been aware for a long period that he was likely to leave and our negotiations to get the best fee for him was independent of our work to replace both him (as we did with Pavyluchenko) and Robbie, with experienced strikers.</p> <p>The ultimate failure - as I have said before - of our dealings in this summer's transfer window was not about the departure of two good strikers, or because we have operated a structure that happens to have had a Sporting Director and a Head Coach, or because our financial parameters are too rigid - after all, let\u00b4s not forget that we did bring in much quality to enhance our current squad. Quite simply, we failed because we were not as decisive or as successful in identifying or replacing the two strikers as early as we should have been. Perhaps these insights will help once and for all to de-bunk the myths that have been perpetuated around these transfers.</p> <p>There is also an inaccurate perception that our Club is run entirely for profit and that football is secondary. Success on the pitch is the sole determinant to the future of the Club and its financial stability, so it would be entirely counter-productive to have anything other than football as our first and foremost priority and it is ridiculous to suggest otherwise. At a time when football clubs are criticised for losing money and for their debt levels, I am surprised that we should be criticised for running our Club on a sound commercial basis and for making a profit. Thank goodness we do make a profit because it has significantly supported the progress we have made over the last seven years and has helped to make us one of Europe's most secure Clubs. I make no apologies for the fact that we reinvest the Club's positive cash flow in both players and infrastructure. </p> <p>And so back to looking ahead and to redress our current position. Firstly, in Harry, we have secured the services of an excellent Manager of proven Premier League quality. Harry will be working with a squad of quality internationals. We must not forget that this team, without the benefit of three additional players at the time (Pavlyuchenko, Corluka, Campbell), gave a more than creditable performance against the current League leaders. I have spoken to the senior players in recent days and I know the players share our frustration and I know they will dig deep to produce the performances we know they are capable of - they have our full support - and support for the team is absolutely critical at this time.</p> <p>We have all been subjected to much criticism - myself, the Board, coaching staff and players - having now made what I considered to be necessary, sweeping changes to our football management team, we must re-assert ourselves, regain our focus, and answer our critics in the best way possible - by winning games again.</p> <p>Secondly, we must prepare ourselves to take advantage of the January transfer window. Harry's experience of the UK and international transfer market will be of critical importance and I shall be looking to Harry for clarity on our priorities. As Chairman, and as previously in our former structure, I must, ultimately, rely on the knowledge and judgement of my technical staff to give me a clear football-based view and recommendation on our transfer targets. </p> <p>I can assure you that everyone here, from the Board to our most junior staff member, shares the frustration and disappointment of the season so far, but I can also assure you that all of us in every area of the Club are doing what we can to help the players to produce the level of performance and the consistent good results our fans expect and all of us crave.</p> <p>We have achieved too much over the last seven years - three successive qualifications for Europe, a League Cup win, Training Centre planning permission - and still more to announce - to allow this to be overtaken and thrown away overnight. We have suffered a set back and we have taken strong action.</p> <p>I have received numerous e-mails and letters from supporters offering advice and suggestions on how the Club should be run and what we should and should not do. I do appreciate the time people take to write to me and when the e-mails or letters are constructive and not abusive, I can assure you that I read as many as I can. And I do take notice of your views. </p> <p>Indeed, I have been heartened by the fact that the over-riding response from our supporters has been one of determination to get behind the team. Too often in difficult times supporters can forget that their support is needed even more than ever. The team will tell you how much of a difference it can make to them on the pitch. White Hart Lane needs to once again become the fortress it was, not so very long ago. With your tremendous support it can. </p> <p>Finally, I know I am sometimes criticised for appearing too business-focused, too uncommunicative, or simply for not being emotional enough when it concerns our team. The majority of our fans know that it's simply not my way to seek a high profile. I do not crave publicity, neither do I believe it is necessary to do my job. I would prefer our team to make the headlines, for the right reasons. We now have a manager who is a great communicator to players, fans and the media alike and I shall also, personally, look to keep you all informed and your questions answered as we progress through the season.</p> <p>Your support has never been more important - and we are grateful to so many of you for the messages of support and encouragement the Club has received during this difficult period. Now's the time for all of us to pull together and to get behind Harry and the team.</p> <p>Yours, Daniel</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/conservatives1\">feature</a> last month on the new crop of Conservative parliamentary candidates offered a fascinating insight into the attitude of the Conservative party on policy areas ranging from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/taxandspending.tax\">tax</a> and wind farms to marriage and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/21/health-health1\">abortion</a>. Not forgetting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/07/eu.conservatives\">Europe</a>.</p> <p>Europhile Conservatives are perhaps not a dying breed after all. Rather, it seems that their divisions on Europe are becoming more entrenched. Their new Westminster candidates like the economic benefits to Britain of the single market, but some would prefer to opt out of the things they don't like.</p> <p>Europhiles still form a sizable proportion of the MEP delegation, with around half refusing to back Cameron's pledge to withdraw the Conservatives from the centre-right EPP group in the European Parliament, but several are standing down next year and look set to be replaced by candidates who are, almost uniformly, ardent Eurosceptics.</p> <p>In the current Westminster crop and its leadership, the reverse is the case \u2013 it would be almost impossible for the Conservatives to be any more Eurosceptic. Where 25 years ago they were the most pro-European major party in Britain, in today's House of Commons you can count the pro-European Tories on the fingers of one hand. Out of 200 MPs, Ian Taylor, David Curry and Ken Clarke were the only three who did not toe the party line and vote against the Lisbon Treaty, and among the other moderates on Europe such as Michael Mates, Damian Green and John Bercow, only Green (who also chairs the moderate Tory Reform Group) sits on the Tory front bench. </p> <p>By contrast, the Conservative benches in the House of Lords have a raft of pro-European grandees, including the likes of Michael Heseltine, Leon Brittan, Tristan Garel-Jones, Douglas Hurd and Geoffrey Howe. It does appear that the overwhelmingly Eurosceptic attitude of the current Conservative party is a generational trend that started when the party ripped itself apart over the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency.</p> <p>So, what policy areas might the Conservatives like Britain to opt out of?</p> <p>The two policy areas where the EU is, rightly, most vulnerable to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/07/eu.conservatives\">criticism</a> are the common agricultural and fisheries policies. On the former, the farming lobby is a significant source of Tory support, since the party holds the majority of rural seats in the UK. As Mark Spencer, candidate for Sherwood, put it, \"as a farmer I'm protected by CAP, it's a source of our livelihood\". Doubtless, the Conservatives will follow the lead of Labour in reforming the CAP (which now accounts for 37% of the EU's total spending as opposed to nearly 80% twenty years ago), since calling for Britain to opt out altogether (and run the risk of European countries undercutting our produce with subsidies) would effectively bankrupt a significant number of British farmers and growers overnight.</p> <p>Meanwhile, opting out of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) could cause similar problems. Fish have an unfortunate habit of not respecting national waters. The only way to preserve stock is to agree and enforce limits on fishing. We would have to negotiate this anyway, even if we were out of the CFP, but from a much weaker position.</p> <p>David Cameron has pledged that a Tory government would take Britain out of the entire <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/06/eu.politics\">social chapter</a> \u2013 a bold promise that offers a clear dividing line between Labour and the Conservatives. But, in practice, it is difficult to see how Cameron could keep this pledge. Restoring Britain's opt-out would require the agreement of every EU country (who would doubtless refuse to do so) and, besides, why do it? As John O'Farrell wrote about Major's claims of victory when achieving the opt-out in his battles over the Maastricht Treaty, do we really want to wave the Union Jack to proudly pronounce that we've got the least protected workers in Europe? Indeed, unwittingly Cameron has highlighted one of the strengths of having social protection legislation at EU rather than national level. </p> <p>What about the common foreign and security policy (CFSP)? It was the Thatcher and Major governments that helped initiate CFSP, adding it to the Maastricht Treaty, so to opt out would be a repudiation of previous Tory government policy. Secondly, it doesn't make sense. When it comes to the situation in Zimbabwe, Burma, Tibet and, most recently the South Ossetia crisis, a group of small and medium sized countries operate most effectively when speaking with one voice. The Tories have tried to have the cake and eat it on CFSP. William Hague has been a frequent critic, while defence spokesman Liam Fox has invented scare stories about a common EU army, but at the same time Hague has urged the EU to take collective action on Zimbabwe and Burma, and the Tories' foreign affairs spokesman in Brussels, Charles Tannock, regarding the war in Afghanistan commented that \"We need a far more coordinated approach by the EU to developing Afghan infrastructure and fighting corruption otherwise the Taliban will win.\" Confused? Not as much as the Tories seem to be!</p> <p>In other words, the new breed of Tory may talk of radically re-negotiating Britain's relationship with the European Union but, save for the extremists who urge withdrawal, in terms of substance, the Conservative policy cupboard on Europe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/eurozone-european-union-financial-crisis-eurosceptics\">still looks pretty bare</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The London Olympics may bring us many joys \u2013 regeneration in the East End, the possibility of a Briton taking gold in \"Whiff Whaff\" (as Boris Johnson referred to that embodiment of the Olympian ideal, table tennis), complete sclerosis on the tube \u2013 but apparently we can forget all about the one \"<a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/24/olympics-london-sport\">legacy</a>\" that might have had genuine and lasting beneficial effects. <br> <a href=\"\" www.thisislondon.co.uk standard-olympics article-23576923-details 2012+target+to+get+britons+active+has+'been+missed' article.do\">2012 target to get Britons active has 'been missed'</a>\" was the headline in the Evening Standard. Progress thus far has been so miniscule (\"statistics are edging up but it is less than 1%,\" says Sport England's chief executive, Jennie Price) that it seems there's no chance of us achieving the aim of 2 million more people breaking into the odd trot, still less of their darkening the doors of their local gym.<br> This should come as no surprise. Sport is now a vicarious, rather than a participatory, aspect of our culture. We don't actually do sport ourselves: we pay others vast sums of money to do it for us. But how have we got here? It's always struck me as odd that some of the most ardent sports fans possess physiques that suggest powerful development of specific muscles \u2013 those required to dislodge a ring pull or prize open the cardboard around a delivery pizza, for instance \u2013 but little in the way of what is conventionally thought of as exercise. \"I'm really into sport\" doesn't mean that you are rarely seen without racquet or ball. It means spending hours in front of the television.  And for this, I blame Nick Hornby. Now it may strike some as a little hard to lay the lard, as it were, of our sports-obsessed nation on the popular novelist's shoulders. But it was around the publication of his book Fever Pitch in the early 1990s that a shift occurred. Suddenly all sorts of people (mainly, but not exclusively, men) who hitherto might have held forth about a book they'd read, an exhibition they'd been to, a play they'd seen, had a new conversational opener: \"Did you see the match last night?\" It was universally assumed that the question required no further elaboration. Everyone knew what \"the match\" was. Further, at some level it carried the sinister implication that you ought to have seen \"the match\", or could at least furnish some explanation for having missed it. Because of course you wanted to see \"the match\", didn't you? (And if not, what kind of weirdo were you?)  That cringe-making title given to football, \"the beautiful game\", said it all: watching sport had been elevated to the same cultural level as the high- and middle- brow arts. And now sport was culture, you didn't have to engage with it in the same way. Seeing it on the box became as admirable a pursuit as going to a gallery (but not painting yourself), or spending an evening at the theatre (while never treading the boards either). But sport-as-culture went far beyond agreeing that there was style and grace to be admired in a batsman such as David Gower, or that there was elegance in the sports writing of Christopher Martin-Jenkins or Alan Watkins. It was a total embrace of everything that \"sport\" represented, and that included and became dominated by the oafish, anti-intellectual mentality of the crowd. It was an easy move at a time when \"irony\" was so in vogue that there were pitfalls in taking anything at face value and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Review_(London)\">Modern Review</a> was in its pomp, proclaiming its mission to cover \"low culture for highbrows\", giving equal weight to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes\">Roland Barthes</a> and Bart Simpson. <br> Such equivalence ignored the challenges and higher pleasures that accompany engagement with great culture, falsely suggesting that it was only available to an elite (when our libraries, museums and radio stations are free for all), while lauding the virtues of the new mateyness. It said it was classless: in fact it merely insulted lower socio-economic groups by implying they were incapable of appreciating anything more than what was to be found in the lowest common denominator.  Popular, mass entertainment certainly has its place. But when I replace Blazing Saddles, The Naked Gun or The Spy Who Loved Me on my DVD shelf, having watched any one of them for probably the 200th time, I don't kid myself that I've participated in an activity in any way virtuous or improving, enjoyable though it may have been. \"Sport\", as it is known in this country, falls into exactly the same category.  But even here there is an important difference. Few of us have the talent to be a new Sinatra or even a winner of Pop Idol. We are all, however, biologically designed to exercise our bodies in the way that sports demand. That is why the Olympics is supposed to celebrate something universal \u2013 the best of what humankind is capable of in terms of physical achievement. It's time to recalibrate our attitude towards sport, strip it of its unwarranted cultural position, and recognise it should be as much about participation as relaxation. \"Just do it,\" as a brand of supposedly sporting footwear has it. <br></p>",
  "<p>After weeks of speculation, finally some decisive action. Following a day of rumours of mounting dressing room unrest at White Hart Lane, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham</a> last night con\ufb01rmed the dismissals of manager Juande Ramos, his \ufb01rst team coaches Gus Poyet and Marcos Alvarez, and much-criticised director of football, Damien Comolli \u2013 and that Ramos' replacement will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portsmouth\">Portsmouth</a>'s Harry Redknapp. </p> <p>'It's a great opportunity for me to manage a big club before I retire,' Redknapp said last night, revealing that Spurs had contacted Portsmouth on Friday morning. 'Tottenham have offered Portsmouth \u00a35m compensation, which is good for the club, and if we're all being honest it has worked out okay for everybody.' </p> <p>Development squad coach Clive Allen and youth team manager Alex Inglethorpe will now take charge of the squad for today's game against Bolton, although Redknapp will attempt to inspire his new players with team talks before, during and after the match.</p> <p>And the new Spurs manager claimed his \ufb01rst task will be to add some steel to a squad he feels is unbalanced after the summer departures of strikers Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane \u2013 while Redknapp himself took striker Jermain Defoe to Pompey in January.</p> <p>'They have a decent squad on paper, although it's not a well-balanced one. It's a squad with good ability, very skilful players \u2013 but maybe a bit of a soft centre,' he said. 'We need a little bit more strength and aggression about the team if we're going to survive. You don't only pick up two points if you're that good. They've been on an horrendous run of games and we've got to get cracking and turn it around as quick as we can.'</p> <p>Redknapp also backed under-\ufb01re chairman Daniel Levy, heavily criticised for the failure of Ramos and his regime. The Spaniard was con\ufb01rmed as Tottenham's head coach a year ago tomorrow, but only after an embarrassingly public pursuit of the former Sevilla boss. </p> <p>'Spurs have a good chairman,' said Redknapp. 'He backs the club, they've pumped massive money into buying good players and I'm sure Juande Ramos was a terri\ufb01c manager but he didn't get the breaks.'</p> <p>The news of the changes last night followed a swirl of rumours and public comments from players about the failing Ramos regime, including claims from a senior dressing-room source that Spurs would end up relegated from the Premier League if Ramos was allowed to continue.</p> <p>The source claimed yesterday that the players had entirely lost con\ufb01dence in his ability to manage them, and were particularly unhappy with his habit of naming his team only a few hours before the game and of altering his formation from pre-match training sessions. </p> <p>The source believes the team have been out of control for several weeks. In February Ramos guided the club to victory in the Carling Cup \ufb01nal, but has led them to just three wins in their subsequent 20 Premier League \ufb01xtures.</p> <p> Having shared a difficult relationship with predecessor Martin Jol, Comolli took an active role in Ramos's recruitment . Captain Ledley King had refused to join the chorus of open insurrection that was rising at White Hart Lane, saying there was 'still time'. </p> <p>But the Spurs captain's defence of his manager was ultimately futile. King, who played only his sixth game of the season against Udinese last week, had insisted: 'It is natural when things are going badly that there are rumours, and there are good players at this club who are frustrated with what's been happening, that is true. But I can tell you we all want the team to turn it around, to do well. We support the manager.' </p> <p>As it turned out they were not merely rumours. What started early in the week as a quiet whinge from the talkative David Bentley \u2013 'It looks like we don't know what we're doing,' he said before being left out of Spurs' squad for the Uefa Cup tie \u2013 was ratcheted up by Jonathan Woodgate and Luka Modric after they lost 2-0 in Italy on Thursday night.</p> <p>Woodgate rated Spurs 'worse than Leeds' when he was with them during their relegation; Modric, a \ufb02eeting presence since his arrival, complained after the Udinese capitulation: 'I did my best but I was all alone in the middle.'</p> <p>The vacancy at Fratton Park, meanwhile, is likely to tempt any of the currently unemployed managers. Sam Allardyce and Alan Curbishley are sure to be in the running, though Kevin Keegan and David O'Leary seem less likely contenders.</p> <p>Tony Adams might feel he is ready to step up from his coaching role at Portsmouth to the gaffer's offce, and Hull City will be wary of any approach for Phil Brown, who has had a stunningly successful start to his Premier League managerial career. </p> <p><strong>Is Redknapp the right choice for Spurs?</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2008/oct/26/tottenhamhotspur-premierleague\">Have your say on the sport blog</a></p>"
