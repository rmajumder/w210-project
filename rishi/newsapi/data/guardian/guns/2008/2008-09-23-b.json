  "<p><strong>Where can I find some ethical trainers?</strong></p> <p>As so often in ethical fashion, it depends on what kind of trainers, and what kind of ethics. For although Nike and other sports companies having improved their act following high-profile campaigns against their use of sweatshop labour in the 1990s, it's still almost impossible to find an ethical pair of sports-specific trainers. The problem is largely one of plastic - synthetic materials like ethyl vinyl acetate, which are very common in sports shoes, are hugely polluting to produce, and would probably survive a nuclear holocaust. Not very biodegradable, in other words. </p> <p>That said, labour issues remain a problem too. <a href=\"http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/\">Labour behind the Label</a> recently released a damning report in the run up to the Olympics, naming and shaming many big-name manufacturers.</p> <p>However, if by trainers you mean the everyday plimsoll-type shoes designed with aesthetic rather than sports considerations in mind - what a friend of mine always calls \"fashion pumps\" - then you are in luck. A few years ago the range was very limited \u2013 and the materials did tend to veer rather heavily towards hemp. Not so any longer. </p> <p>One of my favourite brands is <a href=\"http://www.simpleshoes.com/\">Simple Shoes</a>, who consider every aspect of the trainer-making process, from the soles to the boxes they arrive in. They have a great range made from different types of <a href=\"http://www.simpleshoes.com/info/materials.aspx?g=info\">environmentally friendly materials</a>, from (ahem) hemp and organic cotton to eco-certified leather and suede. I particularly like <a href=\"http://www.simpleshoes.com/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=2179&amp;categoryID=106&amp;g=m&amp;model=CARload-Hemp\">this pair</a> which, alas, only seem as yet to be on their US site and not their UK one. My only real gripe with the company is that in the UK, they seem to simply put in a pound sign in place of the dollar sign. This is a considerable mark-up, even if the exchange rate isn't as great for the British as it was a few months ago.</p> <p>Rather curiously, Simple Shoes are also owned by the same company (Decker) that owns Ugg Boots, a brand that many ethical shoppers may wish to avoid due to their use of sheepskin. It also makes their claim about a founding principle of cutting down on hype rather ironic, though I suppose it would be churlish to hold success against them!</p> <p>Another great choice is <a href=\"http://www.veja-fairtrade.com/\">Veja,</a> a French/Brazilian company. They use natural latex from the Amazon's Chico Mendes reserve. The Amazon is the only place on earth where wild rubber trees are to be found, and tapping them for latex does not involve any felling or killing of trees \u2013 it's a renewable and biodegradable resource. Using these trees could also help ensure the forest remains profitable enough not to be cut down for logging. The company uses organic, Fairtrade-certified cotton for many of the designs, though vegetarians should note that the company does use ecological (chrome-free, vegetable-dyed) leather in some of its shoes. In fact I once had to return a present because while the sole and material of the shoe consisted of cotton and rubber, the \"v\" decoration on the side was made \u2013 rather pointlessly \u2013 of leather. However, last week at the Estethica exhibition at London fashion week Veja showcased their new spring/summer range, which included some lovely designs with not a scrap of leather in sight.</p> <p>If Converse-style trainers are your thing, <a href=\"http://www.ethletic.com/start.html\">Ethletic Sneakers</a> do a mean impression. They are also Fairtrade-certified, though made from plantation rubber grown in Sri Lanka rather than wild rubber as above. Both Ethletic and Veja can be bought online in the UK at <a href=\"http://www.adili.com\">Adili.com</a> - the former for \u00a345 and the latter for around \u00a360. Another option is logo-free <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/blackspot\">Blackspot trainers</a> - not just a pair of shoes but a radical rethinking of capitalism, no less. The shoes are made in a Portuguese union shop: working hours are 8am to 6pm with a 90 minute lunch, and unlimited free consultations with a doctor who visits the factory twice a week. </p> <p>Moving back to sports-specific brands, I confess to knowing very little about the science behind footwear and the stresses and strains put on shoes by running feet, but I'd like to know why sportswear manufacturers can't also use biodegradable rubbers and latex in the soles of their training shoes. After all, you are supposed to replace your running shoes every 400-500 miles, so there hardly seems any need for them to outlast the human race. <a href=\"http://www.mephistoshoes.com/\">Mephisto shoes</a> in the US use such rubbers in their walking shoes so I think there is potential for exploration - and hope for the future. In the meantime, if you are buying sports shoes your best bet is to check the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Shopping-Guide-Charlotte-Mulvey/dp/0954252934\">Good Shopping Guide</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/FreeBuyersGuides/clothing.aspx\">Ethical Consumer website</a> to see which manufacturers score - well, not so much highly as just not too awfully. </p> <p>The excellent Ethical Consumer site very helpfully divides their trainer research into sports and fashion categories - the highest-scoring company on the <a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/FreeBuyersGuides/clothing/trainerssport.aspx\">sports table</a> is Gola, with a meagre 10.5 out of 20. Gola, ASICS and Brooks are their best buys. On <a href=\"http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/FreeBuyersGuides/clothing/trainersfashion.aspx\">the fashion table</a>, Ethletic, as mentioned above, receive an excellent 17.</p> <p>One can only hope that the big sportswear manufacturers start seeing sense and investing some money in exploring renewable resources. It's not like they don't have the money. As Labour behind the Label point out, Nike pays a total of $34m a year to Tiger Woods and to the Brazilian football team, while David Beckham pockets $3.3m from Adidas \u2013 a total that would provide a living wage for 100,000 workers in Indonesia.</p> <p><em>Are you searching for ethical knitwear?

  "<p>How would you sum up your emotions when your team scores a goal? Do you feel good, like James Brown did when he sang I Got You? Perhaps, nonsensically, you feel \"heavy metal\", as in Blur's Song 2, or rapt in amusement, as if Robbie Williams himself was beseeching you to succumb to his compulsion to entertain you.</p> <p>It is even conceivable that a goal inspires you to go west with the Pet Shop Boys or, maybe, that words cannot capture a euphoria which can thus only be conveyed by the rhythms and melodies of that early 1980s one-hit instrumental wonder, Papa's Got a Brand New Pig Bag.</p> <p>Of course, not all goals are winners or equalisers. Some offer only grim succour after a drubbing, possibly making you feel \"you have to laugh or else you'd cry\", just like The Piranhas' Tom Hark. But it seems that these sentiments are common to all fans and that they can only find expression in this sparse clutch of songs. Why else would some clubs subject us to them every time a home goal goes in?</p> <p>They must have a pretty dim view of us if they think we don't know how to celebrate a goal without some sort of cue. I first noticed this phenomenon in America, at NBA games, when the Wurlitzer was switched into hunting-horn mode and a reveille was used to prompt the crowd to chant \"Charge!\" when the home team had the ball or \"Defence!\" when an opposition attack was mounted. Nothing could be left to chance - an atmosphere had to be manufactured to suit the spectacle.</p> <p>When the Premier League was launched in 1992, Sky tried to import such American razzmatazz. Their notorious half-time show for Monday night games featured the Sky Strikers dancing troupe and there was a post-match firework display, too. Widespread ridicule from people who had, on sufferance, tolerated the Dagenham Girl Pipers for decades prompted Sky to accept that the sight of cheerleaders belting out Toni Basil's Mickey and hectoring fans to join in on a November evening at Boundary Park was incongruous at best. The experiment in supporter manipulation was stopped after only one season.</p> <p>If only some clubs had been as wise. Instead, those who struggle to fill their grounds - in some instances because, ironically, their fans don't want a sanitised and orchestrated experience - persist in the belief that you can fill an atmospheric void with muzak, giant foam hands, comedy hats and the infernal clack-clack of those damned rubber clappers. The self-proclaimed \"best league in the world\", which prides itself on the authenticity of its unique matchday \"event\", is prepared to cheat, to give the level of crowd participation a helping hand if it does not come up to scratch.</p> <p>Not all music at sports grounds is pernicious, however. We should certainly keep Goodison Park's Z Cars, Stamford Bridge's The Liquidator, St James' Park's Blaydon Races and Take Me Out to the Ball Game in the seventh-inning stretch. Even Fenway Park's Sweet Caroline can stay. But it is important to note that these songs either precede a game or are played during intervals - not in the middle of the action. They do not intrude and nor, more importantly, do they try to tell you how to react.</p> <p>At a match, I don't want to be whipped up into a frenzy by artificial means. The hysteria generated may give television its end-of-season money shots - of men and women with no sense of perspective openly weeping - to export around the world, but it is demeaning.</p> <p>I am not nostalgic for the days when football was not a family game, characterised memorably by Billy Connolly, 30 years ago, as a time \"when they are shitting in our shoes and we are pissing in their Bovril\". The fear of getting your head kicked in was rife. But I cannot stand the noise pollution now provided by clubs who think you can be dragooned into behaving in a particular way. This has no part in the game's tradition. If it did we would still be hearing the moans of the poor sod who tortured his wrist winding up the phonograph during Arbroath's 36-0 win against Bon Accord over a century ago.</p> <p>The Performing Rights Society, however, will continue to deliver cheques marked \"Reebok Stadium PA\" to the estate of the Godfather of Soul. The sound of silence, or of fans acting independently, cannot be countenanced by those who seek to control us.</p> <p>Perhaps in 20 years' time the game will have had its way and we will all be like Pavlov's dog, conditioned to respond only to the aural stimuli of banal songs chosen to suit a marketing agenda. We must stop it while we can.</p>",
  "<p>A conventional publisher will edit, design and print your book. Warehousing, marketing, distribution, selling, and chasing payments (not to mention paying you royalties) will all be down to your publisher. Self-publishers take on all these tasks themselves. If copies sell, you will make much more money per sale than you would as the author alone. But you may need to invest - and risk - a substantial sum and must be prepared to spend a great deal of time and energy dealing with the business aspects, not least selling.</p> <p>If you want to provide a limited number of attractive copies for friends and relations, it may well be best to pay a good local printer to produce copies to your specifications. A more conventional print-run of, say, 750 copies will cost a few thousand pounds. However, these days much self-publishing is done using print-on-demand (or POD), whereby the company you deal with produces single copies in response to firm orders. You will be expected to pay for specific services such as producing promotional materials and managing typesetting, but that should be all. You as the author should retain all rights. POD books tend not to be stocked by bookshops, which generally work on sale-or-return.</p> <p>Booksellers, reviewers and readers tend to be a bit wary of self-published books, knowing that - even if your book is the exception - many have been rejected by publishers, sometimes for good reason. To sell a book successfully needs plenty of enthusiasm, optimism and patience. Self-publishing is probably most suited to specialist works of non-fiction, particularly if you know the market and can reach buyers readily (eg through lectures, journals or websites). </p> <p>It is important not to confuse self-publishing and \"vanity\" (sometimes called \"subsidy\") publishing. If you publish yourself, you own all the copies and retain all the rights. </p> <p>Vanity publishers, many of whom are charlatans, offer to publish your book if you pay a hefty fee. They will flatter you and promise the earth, but only produce a few cheaply printed copies and sales will be dire. The vanity publisher will own the copies and will ensure that they control most rights in the book too. Many authors who sign such deals report spending a great deal of money and getting little but disappointment in return.

  "<p>The idea is to boldly go where no man has gone before. But for space tourist Richard Garriott, this will take on a new dimension next month when he becomes the first son of a former US astronaut to blast into orbit. </p> <p>Garriott, a Texan computer-game designer, is taking a $30m (\u00a316m) seat on board the Soyuz spacecraft when it travels to the International Space Station. Yesterday the 47-year-old multimillionaire said he had always wanted to follow in his father's footsteps but had been unable to fulfil his dream of becoming a Nasa astronaut because of his poor eyesight.</p> <p>His father, Owen Garriott, 77, visited the Skylab space station in 1973 and made two journeys into space. Garriott Sr plans to visit Russian mission control during his son's 10-day mission.</p> <p>His father gave him one piece of advice, Garriott said yesterday: enjoy the view. \"He's very careful to say 'make sure you take the time just to sit at the window and take a look at the view 'cause it's mighty spectacular,' \" he said. His dream to get to the stars had \"sunk in more deeply [through] growing up with a father who was an astronaut,\" he said. He refused to accept rejection from the astronaut \"club\". \"I was very quickly determined I would not take no for an answer.\"</p> <p>Yesterday the space tourist said he was undaunted by two previous jolting re-entries experienced by Russia's Soyuz capsule and said he looked forward to conducting his own experiments in space. </p> <p>In April a South Korean astronaut said she thought she would die when her Soyuz capsule re-entered the Earth's atmosphere at the wrong angle, exposing the crew to huge gravitational forces and burning parts of the module. The capsule made a \"ballistic\" descent, landing 260 miles off target in Kazakhstan. Several bolts were faulty, it later emerged.</p>",
  "<p>'It sounds ridiculous, but he was a doting father,\" says John Mayhew of his former employee David Cass. This weekend, Cass smothered to death his children, three-year-old Ellie and one-year-old Isobel, before killing himself. Brian Philcox, who on Fathers' Day killed his two children aged seven and three and then himself, attracted similar comments. \"He was a brilliant dad and loved his kids so much,\" his adult son, Mark Laidlaw, told the press.</p> <p>Christopher Foster, who last month shot his wife, Jill, and their 15-year-old daughter, Kirstie, then set fire to the house before killing himself, was also described by Kirstie's headteacher as having \"doted\" on his daughter. Meanwhile, Foster's mother Enid described them as \"a very close, loving family unit\".</p> <p>Every six to eight weeks (and lately, more frequently) a man or a woman - usually a man - kills their partner or their children and then themselves. Most of these cases are never reported. David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, explains that, somewhere along the line, our perception of murder has become warped and \"murder-suicides\" don't quite fit prevailing news values. \"Most people have a view of murder - which is very much constructed by the media - as stranger-perpetrated and requiring police to try to catch those perpetrators. In fact, the clear-up [rate] for murder [is currently around] 88% and that's because you don't have to be a Cracker to work out who's done it. When it comes to children, the most likely person to kill them is their parent, just as when it comes to adults, the most likely person is their partner.\"</p> <p>But what drives these people, who are so often described as being devoted to their families, to carry out such a brutal crime? And can anything be done to prevent it?</p> <p>Chris Milroy, a forensic pathologist at the Forensic Science Service who studies murder-suicides, says that \"When men kill their children there tends to be revenge in the equation. It's like they're saying, 'If I can't have them, no one can.'\" </p> <p>Consider Cass, whose children's bodies were found in a caravan in Southampton on Sunday, parked in the garage where Cass had worked for four years. He had separated from the children's mother, Kerry Hughes, four months earlier and appears to have smothered the girls, before telephoning Hughes to tell her what he had done. \"He said to her, 'The children have gone to sleep for ever and I'm going to hang myself,'\" a family friend, Val Frasier, told the press. His body was found nearby. </p> <p>Critically, Cass appears to have been involved in a custody battle with the children's mother; it was the girls' first visit with him since the split. Earlier in the week, he had been hopeful about custody arrangements. \"On Friday morning he was ecstatic with it all - he said it all looked good and he thought he could get back into the house and have custody of the kids,\" said another colleague. But by the afternoon, he had handed in his notice. \"He said to me he was going away and he had a plan. I said, 'Don't do anything stupid.'\" </p> <p>The rise in men feeling powerless in custody battles - as demonstrated by the high profile of organisations such as Fathers4Justice - is undoubtedly significant, as the founder of the group himself has admitted. Earlier the month, Matt O'Connor said he decided to close the group after Brian Philcox phoned its advice line and then killed himself and his kids. \"I felt I had become responsible for the behaviour of every father,\" he told the Sun newspaper.</p> <p>Perhaps most astonishing is that these men's actions often seem totally out of character. They haven't usually turned to drink or drugs, they don't tend to have a criminal record and Milroy says that despite perpetrators who survive almost always pleading insanity, it's merely an excuse - most have not suffered mental health problems. </p> <p>Earlier this year, Wexford businessman Diarmuid Flood apparently gave no signs that anything was amiss. In fact, the Floods were described as \"the village's golden couple\", yet he shot his wife Lorraine in the chest as she lay in bed and drugged his children before setting fire to their house in Clonroche, Ireland. Afterwards, he killed himself. Seven-year-old son Mark was found dead on the upstairs landing, while his five-year-old sister Julie was found in her badly burned bed, clutching her favourite teddy bear. </p> <p>Flood - who, it is believed, was under financial pressure - was described by regulars at his local pub as being \"quiet and reserved\", \"a private man\". But here lies the problem. These are men who have huge difficulty expressing or identifying emotions - at least verbally. Replace \"quiet\" and \"reserved\" with \"inhibited\" and \"repressed\" and you start to hit the mark. When something happens to these men, such as their wife leaving them or going into debt, all hell breaks loose - literally. </p> <p>In the United States, which now sees 10 murder-suicides a week, they have coined names for such men: \"slam dunk murderers\" and \"family annihilators\" are current favourites. \"The profile of a family annihilator is a middle-aged man, a good provider who would appear to neighbours to be a dedicated husband and a devoted father,\" says Professor Jack Levin, a leading expert from North-Eastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, who has studied such cases. </p> <p>\"Often he tends to be quite isolated. He is often profoundly dedicated to his family, but has few friends of his own or a support system outside the family. He will have suffered some prolonged frustration and feelings of inadequacy, but then suffers some catastrophic loss. It is usually financial or the loss of a relationship. He doesn't hate his children, but he often hates his wife and blames her for his miserable life. He feels an overwhelming sense of his own powerlessness. He wants to execute revenge and the motive is almost always to 'get even'.\"</p> <p>Davina James-Hanman, director of the Greater London Domestic Violence Project, believes \"powerlessness\" is the key word here. \"Domestic violence, whether sustained or carried out in a single killing, is essentially about power and control. If you think of the violence as a continuum, with murder at one end and minor abuse - for want of a better description - at the other, abusive men will go as far down the continuum as they need to establish the power and control to which they feel they're entitled. If the woman leaves the relationship - the ultimate challenge to his control - he will sometimes come back with the ultimate sanction and sometimes the only way to get back at her is through the children.\"</p> <p>A particularly macabre feature of murder-suicides is that contrary to claims that the killings must have been the result of a momentary act of insanity, virtually all are premeditated. Diarmuid Flood is typical in having borrowed shotgun cartridges two days before he murdered his wife and children, and film from Christopher Foster's security cameras showed him driving a horsebox to the front gates, before shooting the tyres to prevent emergency services accessing the property. Julia Pemberton's ex-husband repeatedly warned her that he would kill her. It wasn't that she didn't take notice, as she told friends, family and police. Family court judges were aware of the terror. Her final 16-minute 999 call made headlines in 2004 when it was read out at the inquest into her and her 17-year-old son William's murders, committed by her husband, who also killed himself. </p> <p>As with many of the families devastated by this crime, the Pembertons' life appeared normal enough. They owned a large house in Newbury, Berkshire, their children did well and they both had good jobs. But scratch below the surface and you discover that although her ex-husband had never been physically abusive, he was controlling and there were vicious verbal assaults. Sometimes she was deprived of money for petrol or food. When she said she wanted a divorce, he responded by saying he'd kill her, then himself.</p> <p>In other cases of murder suicide - which, despite the recent spate, have remained constant in terms of numbers for several decades - there is a very clear history of domestic violence. In the early years of Sarah Heatley's marriage, her husband was very committed to his family and he adored his children, Nina and Jack. But eventually his work as a GP frustrated him and he was also building up debts. He became violent and started to beat Sarah, once even trying to strangle her. When he threatened to kill her, she left their home in Derbyshire with the children under police escort. But when she filed for divorce, he started ringing her constantly and breaking into her house. Despite various professionals knowing he was dangerous, he was given the right to see the children unattended. One evening in 1994, he picked up four-year-old Nina and three-year-old Jack and strangled them, wrote confessional notes and then killed himself.</p> <p>In about half of all murder-suicide cases, there is a prior history of domestic abuse. A report published in 2004 by Women's Aid found that, out of 13 families where a child had been killed by a parent, domestic violence was a feature in 11. In one of the other two cases, the mother spoke of her ex-partner's obsessive and controlling behaviour.</p> <p>Sometimes, either alongside or instead of the sexual jealousy and the need to be in control, the perpetrator actually believes theirs is an act of kindness, says Iain Stephen, consultant forensic clinical psychologist. \"They almost see themselves as 'saving' or 'protecting' their family from the horrors of the world,\" he explains. It may, for example, be a case of, \"I'm in debt. My family will lose everything. It's best we all just go to sleep. </p> <p>\"It's like love twisted round. They think, 'My life is over, everything is hopeless and the only answer is to take my children to a better place.' In their own twisted minds, it's proving their love for their children,\" explains Ged Bailes, head of forensic clinical psychology at the Norvic Clinic in Norwich. \"But it's important to remember this isn't always the case. Many cases are about aggressive revenge - a case of 'I'm going to hurt you like you hurt me.'\" </p> <p>Either way, he says, \"Whenever you hear, 'But they were such a decent person,' actually when you go behind the scenes you can see that they were controlling, there were problems in the relationship, they had a very self-centred view of life. I think it's important not to talk about types, though. This is about traits.\"</p> <p>While almost all murder-suicide perpetrators are men, there are some female culprits. Unlike men, however, they rarely kill their partners as part of their crime and instead almost always focus on taking their children's lives. Unlike men, the motivation is usually despair. \"They feel their children's lives have been destroyed,\" says Milroy, providing an example of a 31-year-old woman whose victim was her 10-year-old daughter. She had told her psychiatrist that at times, she saw little purpose in life. Then, two days before they died, she was arrested and charged with shoplifting. Four notes, written by the woman to her husband, explained that she had not been a good mother to their daughter and that she would be better off dead.</p> <p>Fiona Ann Pilkington, 38, murdered her disabled daughter and killed herself by setting fire to the car they were in last year after teenagers had embarked on a campaign of terror against her daughter, Francesca Hardwick, 18. Neighbours told how children had shouted things like \"disabled bitch\" as she stood at her window. Other neighbours told how the gangs of children would hang around, making the family virtual prisoners. </p> <p>There's a third contrast to men: women who commit murder-suicide tend to have a recognised mental illness, often suffering from a severe form of postnatal depression. Last year, Nollaig Owen, who drowned her nine-month-old son before taking her own life, refused to get help for her postnatal depression despite pleas from her family. It is understood that the 33-year-old from Kilworth, Ireland, had threatened to take her own life on at least one other occasion since the birth.</p> <p>However, while females make up just 5% of perpetrators today, Donald West, now retired professor in criminology at the University of Cambridge, stresses that from 1948 to 1962, that figure was 40%. \"The fall occurred in the late 60s, around the same time as the fall in suicide of women generally,\" he says, explaining that women have a strong tendency to go for more passive forms of killing - such as coal-gas poisoning - and there became fewer ways of achieving that.</p> <p>It is also doubtless significant that in the post-war years women had less control over their own lives. With the war over and the men back home, there was little need for them to be out of the house. Most were stuck at home, many felt powerless and lots became depressed. It is surely no coincidence that the drop in numbers occurred in the 60s - a time that saw huge strides in female liberation, as well as new approaches to depression and mental health. Better treatments and therapy became available which, from the beginning, women have been more likely to take advantage of. </p> <p>Of the hundreds of assailants that Milroy has studied, only one, he believes, could have been predicted and therefore prevented. \"Every day men and women become depressed, have problems, get deserted. They almost always survive and suicide and murder rarely follow.\"</p> <p>But Sue Dunstall, policy adviser for health at the NSPCC, believes that the now commonplace Child Death Overview Panels have a part to play. \"They can help identify areas about which something can be done, even where there are no apparent warning signs. It seems there are always triggers and we may be able to learn something about public health messages from those triggers.\" </p> <p>James-Hanman says measures taken in the capital prove murder-suicide rates can be reduced. \"Over the past six years in London, we've reduced domestic violence homicide by 58% and we haven't had a single family annihilator. One reason is the introduction of standardised risk assessment for all officers first called to a scene of domestic violence. Because they are asking better questions, they are getting better responses and making more informed decisions.\"</p> <p>James-Hanman says it's also significant that they've managed to stop police offering \"trite relationship advice\" and comments that border on criticism of a relationship. \"We used to get quite a lot of complaints from women about this. But women want action and now that they're getting it, murder-suicide hasn't happened.\"</p> <p>She adds that high-risk victims are now provided with advocates and their case goes to a multi-agency risk conference. \"Senior representatives from a range of agencies - on average, between 15 and 25 people - meet to look at what can be done to manage the risk. Because these conferences happen fortnightly - or monthly, when it comes to high-risk cases - an emergency plan can be devised without having to spend three days on the phone trying to find the right people to talk to. These conferences are not uniform across London yet, but they will be by 2010.\"</p> <p>Nicola Sharp, head of policy and parliamentary affairs at Refuge, wants to see better risk assessment and better inter-agency cooperation become more commonplace elsewhere. \"Some forces are better than others and it still depends too much on a commanding officer's personal view on the issue. What is low-risk one day can escalate quickly and responding appropriately to that can depend on police response. As it is, there is still too much reliance on women being able to manage violent men.\"</p> <p>David Wilson adds that a cultural shift is necessary to stop us viewing children as possessions or pawns. \"The social construction of childhood is such that children are seen as weak and voiceless - the property of their parents. But if we applied the principle of seeing them as autonomous and having a voice to issues such as custody proceedings - asking, 'Which parent do you want to live with?', for example - that might potentially do something about the numbers of kids that are battered or murdered. Then there are laws around smacking. Again, the fact that we legally sanction it fits into this sense of children being merely a form of property of their parents.\"</p> <p>For Sarah Heatley, there is no doubt that her children's murders could have been prevented and she would like to see a radical overhaul of the judicial system, particularly the family courts, which granted her husband contact with their children, believing Heatley to be \"a hysterical and over-reactive wife\". Indeed, there is still a ludicrous attitude that, \"He might be abusive to the mother, but he's still a good father.\" </p> <p>Frank Mullane, brother of Julia Pemberton, believes her husband should have been jailed at the point of making death threats. \"It is punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment, but no police officers came to my sister's house when she complained about the death threats. Five days before, when a bike was stolen, two police officers came.\" </p> <p>Mullane, who is now involved with the charity Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse, which was set up in memory of Julia and William Pemberton, adds that family and friends can help, too. \"In wanting to be the fun uncle, I avoided ever saying, 'Will, do you need to talk about your Dad?' He might have had information and fears that this was going to happen. I urge agencies to be more proactive and family and friends to never doubt that people are capable of this.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Bush stood unrepentant and unbowed before the 192 member countries of the UN general assembly yesterday to deliver a valedictory address devoted almost entirely to terrorism, which he described as an evil that must be defeated.</p> <p>In his eighth and final address to a largely silent hall of world leaders, the US president sounded a note that has changed remarkably little since he first spoke to the general assembly in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC. He said the global movement of violent extremists remained a challenge as serious as any since the foundation of the UN in 1945: \"Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has no place in the modern world,\" he said.</p> <p>Bush took the opportunity to assess his two terms in power that contained no regrets and no apology.</p> <p>Afghanistan and Iraq had been transformed, he said, \"from regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that fight terror\".</p> <p>Libya had renounced its backing of extremists and dropped its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were engaged in</p> <p>the struggle to root out extremism. Democracy, too, had spread around the world under his watch. \"Whenever or wherever people are given the choice, they chose freedom,\" he said.</p> <p>In the seven years since Bush launched the so-called war on terror, his administration has become among the most controversial in US history. It has been criticised on the world stage for flouting international law, and for ineffective handling of the aftermaths of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The speech came at a time when many of the objectives of the Bush administration appear to be facing reverses.</p> <p>The Taliban are on the rise again in Afghanistan, violence is rife in Pakistan, the Middle East peace initiative has stalled, and attempts to stop Iran and North Korea from developing a nuclear capacity are wavering.</p> <p>There was only passing reference to such downsides to his legacy during the 21 minutes of the speech. The only hint at fallibility came with the concession that \"we have witnessed successes and setbacks\" and a reference to the fight in Iraq as having been \"difficult\".</p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 without approval from the UN constituted one of the most serious blows to the authority of the world body since its founding. Bush hinted at the upheaval by talking about the \"disagreements our nations have had on Iraq\" but added that daily life in the country had improved dramatically in the past two years and \"we should all welcome this progress towards stability and peace\". Though Bush chided the UN at the height of the Iraq crisis for being close to an irrelevance, he did offer an olive branch yesterday, saying that the extremist threat made multilateral organisations \"needed more than ever\".</p> <p>The president had direct words to say to the delegations seated in front of him from Russia, which he said had violated the UN charter by sending troops into Georgia. \"We must stand united in our support of the people of Georgia. Young democracies around the world are watching to see how we respond to this test,\" he said.</p> <p>He also singled out North Korea and Iran for their nuclear programmes, calling on the UN to impose stiffened sanctions against both, and Iran and Syria for continuing to sponsor terror.</p> <p>The inclusion of Iran on both his lists of culprits was not lost on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president. Ahmadinejad addressed the assembly a few hours after Bush, and accused the US of making illegal demands against what he called Iran's \"peaceful nuclear programme\".</p> <p>He also effectively accused Israel of controlling the US presidential contest, saying \"a small but deceitful minority of Zionists are playing with the American public\".</p> <p>Meanwhile a separate round of diplomacy also attracted attention - that of the Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin. She began a series of meetings with world leaders including the Afghan president Hamid Karzai and Colombian president \u00c1lvaro Uribe, but remained firmly behind closed doors with no media in attendance.</p> <h2>Shadow of 9/11</h2> <p>President Bush's final speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday brings him back full circle to November 10 2001 when he first delivered a belligerent address to world leaders that set out the fundamentals of what would come to be known as his \"war on terror\".</p> <p>The dust had barely settled over Ground Zero following the 9/11 attacks that had occurred less than two months previously. As he told the world leaders in a special Saturday session at the UN building in New York, \"a few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble\".</p> <p>The shadow of 9/11 hung over the UN building on that day, and set the tone of Bush's address to the world. \"The time for sympathy has now passed. The time for action has now arrived,\" he said. \"Each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone\".</p> <p>In hindsight, the 22-minute oration Bush gave on November 11 2001 gave a clear taste of the rest of his presidency. \"For every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The financial meltdown in the money markets last week has not just put thousands of City jobs at risk and changed the landscape of our banking industry. Beyond the gleaming towers of Canary Wharf and the trading floors of the Square Mile, some of the poorest boroughs in the UK will also feel the fallout from the economic crisis unleashed by their wealthy neighbours. Hundreds of charities, schools and community projects in the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney, which have come to rely heavily on the largesse of City firms and their employees, are likely to suffer a major setback in their drive to tackle deprivation. </p> <p>For Eastside Young Leaders' Academy, the Newham-based charity and after-school programme for local black boys on the verge of exclusion - founded by former prison governor and ex-deputy mayor of London, Ray Lewis - the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers is expected to hit hard. The bank's European Foundation had donated \u00a3300,000 over three years to roll out the academy's unique combination of tutoring, strict discipline and mentoring to seven other disadvantaged boroughs.</p> <p>Lehman Brothers' employees also volunteered as mentors in the academy, developing the boys' social skills, business acumen and public speaking. Of the academy's relationship with Lehman Brothers, Lewis says in the company's 2007 Global Philanthropy report that the mentors \"give the boys permission to be great\". A vice-president from the bank sits on Eastside's board of trustees, helping to build the capacity of the organisation so that it can broaden its activities. </p> <p>Another casualty of Lehman's demise is likely to be a catch-up maths programme for primary school pupils. Every Child Counts, which involves one-to-one tuition for children who at the age of seven are identified as falling behind, had been promised a \u00a31m grant over five years to reach 30,000 pupils by 2010-11, when the scheme is to be introduced nationally. </p> <p><strong>Funding assurances</strong></p> <p>Jean Gross, director of the Every Child A Chance Trust, the City-based charity that runs the maths programme and a similar literacy programme that the government rolled out in primary schools nationally this month, says it has received only the first year of the grant, but has had assurances from Lehman Brothers that the pending \u00a3800,000 is secure. She says: \"The European Foundation is a separate company from the investment bank, so we have been told that the funding should come through.\" </p> <p>Asked about UK organisations promised donations from the Lehman Brothers Foundation Europe, Andrea Sullivan, Lehman Brothers' head of corporate philanthropy and cultural partnerships Europe and the Middle East, says: \"We're doing everything we can to honour the commitments the foundation has made.\" </p> <p>Yet even if the cash arrives, charities are bracing themselves for the knock-on effect of up to 5,000 job losses at the bankrupt bank and possible job cuts at other City firms. Volunteering programmes, charity-of-the-year fundraising activities and payroll giving schemes will all be hit.</p> <p>Southwark-based Kids Company has already received a number of cancellations from groups of former Lehman Brother employees who will no longer be volunteer painters and decorators to brighten up the homes of deprived young people. \"It's so sad,\" says the children's charity's founder, Camila Batmanghelidjh. \"These are young people often living in unbelievable squalor with a single parent who has mental health problems.\" </p> <p>The charity, which works with some of the most damaged inner-city children, has over the last year received \u00a3100,000-worth of support from Lehman Brothers, including the donation of time from some 500 staff. \"We had built up a great relationship with the bank,\" Batmanghelidjh says. \"Even in the thick of the crisis last week when they had all lost their jobs, someone bothered to call us to say they had things in the corporate office they wanted to give us, such as T-shirts.\" </p> <p>Every Child A Chance had hoped that Lehman staff could work with children who had come through Every Child A Reader and Every Child Counts intitiavies. \"That is an irretrievable loss,\" Gross says. </p> <p>But is not just the high-profile recipients of Lehman Brothers support that will be hit. Well-established corporate social responsibility (CSR) links, developed over years between the firm and schools to attract working-class and ethnic minority youth into financial services, will suffer. Oaklands school, in Tower Hamlets, will be hard hit when 20 regular volunteers from Lehman fail to turn up for the extra literacy classes with pupils this week. The decade-long relationship - which included Saturday study days at Lehman Brothers' Canary Wharf offices, mock job interviews, and work experience, as well as extra help with reading, science and languages - has been shortlisted for the 2008 Lord Mayor's Dragon award, which next month will recognise outstanding CSR across London. </p> <p>Oaklands' headteacher, Patrice Canavan, says the long-standing support has increased her pupils' confidence and aspiration. \"Lehman Brothers has a very can-do mentality,\" she says. \"Although many of our pupils come from challenging circumstances, they expect them to achieve. We will hopefully find new partners, but it will be a very tall order to match Lehman Brothers.\"</p> <p><strong>Plug the hole</strong></p> <p>Mike Tyler, director of Tower Hamlets Education Business Partnership, will have the job of filling the gap left by the loss of more than 100 Lehman Brothers staff in the borough's schools. He has a pool of about 4,500 City firm volunteers who are helping to bridge the skills gap between what local students can offer and what employers expect. He also needs to find companies willing to plug the financial hole left by the investment bank, which has funded its Getting Ahead and Passport to Employment programmes.</p> <p>But should some of the Lehman Brothers' business units continue under new ownership at Barclays and Japanese bank Nomura, Tyler believes there is a chance its support may resume. He is also cautiously optimistic that an award-winning Merrill Lynch programme to help disaffected pupils become budding entrepreneurs could be unscathed by last week's Bank of America takeover. \"We have just got funding for another year, and hope the new owners will leave its community programme alone,\" he says. \"We don't know what will emerge from the ashes. We have reserves for a rainy day - and at the moment it's very rainy.\"</p> <p>But in the US, where Lehman's US Foundation distributed $39m (\u00a321m) to more than 200 not-for-profit organisations in the year up to November 2007, the voluntary sector is already counting the cost. \"The philanthropy of Lehman Brothers will leave a gap for New York City,\" says Melissa Berman, chief executive of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors.</p> <p>In the UK, 20 CSR managers from leading City law firms and banks met on Friday to agree to try to fill gaps in charity funding or volunteering left by the current turmoil. Carolyn Housman, corporate responsibility manager at the City of London Corporation, says: \"Many financial firms we work with have let us know that they are keen to fill any potential shortfalls that are a result of recent economic activities.\"</p> <p>Although not exactly a cast-iron rescue package, Housman adds: \"There's a sense we need to pull together and cover each other. They are definitely taking collective responsibility and collective action.\"</p> <p>The charities and community groups already reeling from the City crash hope the move signals that a strong culture of giving will survive a recession. Gross says: \"The City needs to be philanthropic because it wants to maintain the positive image [charities] have of it.\"</p>",

  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday outlined a fresh philosophy to revive his fortunes when he declared that he would champion a \"new settlement for new times\".</p> <p>In a personal address, in which he admitted a mistake in abolishing the 10p starting rate of tax, the prime minister said he was best placed to take Britain through the greatest upheaval since the Industrial Revolution and set out the idea of \"a new settlement for new times. A fair Britain for the new age\".</p> <p>The prime minister - who spoke of his lifelong passion for the NHS being inspired by a \"great surgeon and great nurses\" who saved his sight after a rugby accident as a teenager - outlined a series of policies which will see the government legislate to enshrine the abolition of child poverty in law, abolish prescription charges for people battling cancer and abolish charges for people suffering long-term conditions.</p> <p><strong>Personal</strong></p> <p>Introduced by his wife Sarah, Brown opened his speech with a personal account of what had inspired him to enter politics. \"I didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular. Perhaps, that's just as well.</p> <p>\"I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted - and want - to change it. So I'm not going to try to be something I'm not. And if people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about - I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country.\"</p> <p><strong>Mistakes</strong></p> <p>Soon after beginning his speech Brown answered a persistent criticism in recent months - that he has refused to admit mistakes - when he admitted he had underestimated the impact of abolishing the 10p starting rate of tax.</p> <p>\"Where I've made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes - because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be.\"</p> <p><strong>Unity</strong></p> <p>Amid speculation that some cabinet ministers are prepared to force Brown from office by threatening to resign, the prime minister issued a stern message of the dangers of disunity. \"The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country. The people of Britain would never forget if we failed to put them first - and, friends, they'd be right.\"</p> <p><strong>Financial crisis</strong></p> <p>With some ministers saying the crisis on world stock markets may provide Brown with his \"Falklands moment\", Brown said Labour was best placed to help people through the biggest change since the Industrial Revolution. \"This last week will be studied by our children as the week the world was spun on its axis and old certainties were turned on their heads. And in these uncertain times, we must be, we will be, the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand.</p> <p>\"And, friends, it's a calling that summons us because in every time of profound change those with great wealth and privilege have always been able to look after themselves. But our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most - people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amid this change.\"</p> <p><strong>NHS</strong></p> <p>Brown said his lifelong commitment to the NHS was inspired by his experience after losing the sight of one eye after a rugby accident at the age of 16. \"Last year in Bournemouth I told you how when I was 16, I got injured playing rugby and lost the sight forever in my left eye. I knew I couldn't play football or rugby any more. But I could still read.</p> <p>\"But what I didn't tell you last year was that then one morning I woke up and realised my sight was going in my good eye. I had another operation and lay in the darkness for days on end. At that point my future was books on tape.</p> <p>\"But thanks to the NHS, my sight was saved by care my parents could never have afforded. And so it's precisely because I know and have heard from others about the miraculous difference a great surgeon and great nurses and great care can make that I'm so passionate about the values of the NHS.\"</p> <p><strong>Tories</strong></p> <p>In one of the few light moments of his speech, Brown mocked David Cameron as too inexperienced to become prime minister. \"Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice. I believe in giving credit where it's due. The Conservative leader's team are smart - they've got a plan, and they are implementing it ruthlessly. Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.</p> <p>\"And when salesmen won't tell you what they are selling, it's because they are selling something no one should buy. But I'm a man for detail and I've discovered some clues about what would be in store in a Conservative Britain. They want us to believe that, like us, they now care about public services. But when Mr Cameron actually talks to his party about their spending plans he says the difference between Labour and Tory levels of public investment will be 'dramatic' and 'fundamental'.\"</p> <p><strong>Fairness</strong></p> <p>Hitting back at the Tories, who are portraying themselves as the champions of fairness and of progressive politics, Brown said fairness lay at the heart of the Labour party. \"Fairness is in our DNA ... For too long we've developed only some of the talents of some people - but the modern route to social mobility is developing all the talents of all the people ... helping those who are working their way up from very little and lifting up those in the middle who want to get on.\"</p> <p><strong>Family and children</strong></p> <p>With some Labour figures, including former Peter Mandelson adviser Derek Draper, calling on Brown to put his children in front of the cameras, the prime minister made clear he had no intention of following the example set by Cameron. \"Here I am, working for this incredible country, while trying as far as possible to give my children an ordinary childhood. Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple. My children aren't props; they're people.\"</p> <p><strong>As Jackie Wilson said ...</strong></p> <p>Gordon's Brown's decision to arrive and depart the stage to the strains of the late soul singer Jackie Wilson may have surprised those who had the prime minister down as an Arctic Monkeys man. But the choice of music was curiously apt. Just as Tony Blair's adoption of D:Ream's Things Can Only Get Better suggested the social and political nadir of the 1990s had, thankfully, been reached, so Brown's choice of (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher hinted that the PM had finally awoken from his own dark night of the soul. Or, as the song has it: \"Now once I was downhearted/Disappointment was my closest friend/But then you came and he soon departed/And you know he never showed his face again.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ian Pearson needs to get his science straight before considering taking a stance in support of GM (Science minister attempts to reopen the debate on GM crops, September 22). Properties such as innate pest or blight resistance, drought or salt tolerance and yield are sophisticated processes that manifest from the function of multiple genes working in a tightly regulated, coordinated manner. The introduction of such properly functioning complex gene networks in plants by the crude and genetically disruptive GM transformation process is currently not possible. Fortunately, we have better alternatives that can contribute to alleviating the world's food problems now. </p> <p>First, the biotechnological procedure of marker-assisted selection (MAS), which uses our increasing knowledge of gene maps, can significantly expedite the identification of new crop varieties with complex desirable properties created by natural cross-breeding programmes. Unlike GM, there are no inherent safety concerns with MAS that makes use of the vast gene pool of any given food crop in a manner that retains natural gene order and function. </p> <p>Second, a 1996 report by the National Research Council in the US highlighted that there already exist many crops such as fonio, pearl millet, African rice that are naturally adapted to harsh climates and marginal soils as well as being nutritious and tasty. Unfortunately, outside interference has led to these hardy staples being displaced by maize, wheat and Asian rice. In the face of climate change, the world needs fast solutions to its food problems, which MAS and a return to traditional food varieties can provide and which GM simply cannot deliver.</p> <p><strong>Dr Michael Antoniou</strong><br>King's College London </p> <p>Ian Pearson's comments reveal a government increasingly prepared to act as a mouthpiece for the GM industry. GM crops have failed to deliver - they do not yield more than conventional crops and there is not a single GM drought or salt-tolerant crop available commercially. </p> <p>The government's own GM public debate in 2003 revealed widespread scepticism over both GM crops and corporate control of the food system. Instead of trying to convince the public to support GM and continuing to fund this unpopular and ineffective technology, the government must focus on the real farming solutions backed by 400 scientists in a recent UN report on the future of agriculture. This means meeting local food needs by combining science and technology with communities' traditional knowledge to support localised and diverse farming.</p> <p><strong>Clare Oxborrow</strong><br>Food campaigner, Friends of the Earth </p> <p>Another week, another government minister tries to persuade us to grow GM crops. It is as if the UN report earlier this year, endorsed by the UK government, has been forgotten. The International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development report said GM technology was not a quick fix to feed the world's poor. The 400 scientists who wrote it said they saw little role for GM in feeding the poor on a large scale; data on some GM crops indicated highly variable yield gains in some places and declines in others. GM crops are not banned in the UK; it is just that hardly anyone wants to buy them, and so no farmer wants to risk growing them. The environment minister, Phil Woolas, is giving opponents of GM crops a year to join in a debate. What will happen at the end of this one-year consultation that will be different to the situation as it stands today?</p> <p><strong>Roger Mainwood</strong><br>Wivenhoe, Essex </p> <p>Ian Pearson believes that the British public would accept GM crops if they were beneficial to consumers. Yet the public would gladly forgo those benefits if they knew what the government is ignoring: that every feeding trial carried out by independent scientists on laboratory animals results in serious harm to their health. Government assurances of safety rely on tests submitted by the GM seed developers. There are many other reasons why GM crops should be neither grown nor eaten, but these facts alone should suffice to call for a moratorium, at least, and not promotion. Ministers are failing in their responsibility to protect the people and the environment in their zeal to promote the economy. </p> <p><strong>Eva Novotny</strong><br>Cambridge</p>",
  "<p>Rod Aldridge accuses me of distorting the facts about the loss of special needs facilities at the proposed academy school in Brighton (Letters, September 17). The reality is that an existing special needs centre serving children across the city will be replaced by a smaller facility simply for students at the school. And the proposed football stadium car park will be built on part of the existing school site, so the school will have less land as a result. Yes, he has said the academy will follow the council's admissions procedures for a little while - but he could change his mind at any time, leaving one of the most deprived areas of the city without a single LEA-run community secondary school. </p> <p>The Green alternative is simple: the government should stop blackmailing communities by offering them school improvements only if they hand over control and management from local authorities to private businesses and Labour donors. It should properly fund community schools, however they are run.</p> <p><strong>Dr Caroline Lucas MEP</strong><br>Leader, Green party</p>",
  "<p>The stretch of sandy coastline around Formby in Merseyside has long been popular with Premiership footballers from nearby Liverpool and from Manchester. But football stars are not Formby's most famous residents. That honour goes to the red squirrels that have scampered for decades in the pine forest between the town's wide streets and the sand dunes that protect them from the sea.</p> <p>Some 360,000 people visit the National Trust reserve there each year, and most go home happy to have seen a red squirrel. For decades, Formby, and the surrounding borough of Sefton, has had the highest density of red squirrels in England and, until recently, it was not unusual to see groups of 20 or 30 animals together.</p> <p>But visit Formby now and the squirrels are missing. A survey planned for next month is expected to confirm that a deadly virus has swept through the area, sending the red squirrel population crashing to such low levels that it may never recover. Hundreds of the animals are feared to have died, and many more are not expected to make it through the winter. According to Andrew Brockbank, the National Trust property manager who has worked at Formby for 11 years, the situation is \"very bleak\".</p> <p>The squirrelpox virus arrived at Sefton's isolated red squirrel colony in October last year. Since then, it has spread viciously, with the unusually high number of squirrels helping the disease jump from animal to animal. A survey in spring this year found that numbers were already down 60% on the 1,000 or so counted at the same time in 2007.</p> <p>It is a horrible way for the squirrels to die. Infected animals become lethargic and uncoordinated, before developing open lesions on their eyes, mouths, ears and paws. The virus usually kills within two weeks, if the weakened animal is not taken by a fox or other predator - and it is 100% lethal. As far as experts know, every single red squirrel infected with the disease and left in the wild has died. \"If it was only 99% lethal, then at least we would be looking at the possibility of a population of naturally resistant animals that could repopulate an area,\" says Steve White, an ecologist with the Lancashire Wildlife Trust. \"But there is no case of a squirrel in the wild ever recovering from it.\"</p> <p>The blame is pinned squarely on the grey squirrel, the North American arch-enemy of the native British red. Greys carry the squirrel pox virus and are not affected by it, but transmit it to their susceptible red cousins. White says the incursion of just a single infected grey could have caused the Sefton outbreak, with the disease now endemic in the red population and spreading.</p> <p><strong>Outmuscled</strong></p> <p>The implications of this form of biological warfare could stretch beyond Formby. For decades, scientists thought that the vanishing of the red squirrel from almost all of the English countryside was down to them simply being outmuscled by the stronger greys, who stole their food. </p> <p>Now evidence is emerging that squirrel pox could have done the damage. Research by Peter Lurz, of Newcastle University, with colleagues in London, shows that in areas where the squirrel pox virus is present, reds disappear some 17-25 times faster than through competition with greys for food alone. Exactly how is unclear - it could be fleas, or another route - but the impact can be sudden and dramatic. In Cumbria and Norfolk in the late 1990s, the arrival of the virus precipitated a rapid loss of red squirrels, despite a long-term presence of greys. </p> <p>If the virus continues to spread - and it has recently been found as far north as the Scottish borders - then no red squirrel on mainland Britain is safe. White says: \"All we can do really is to try to slow its spread until we can develop a vaccine. That is the only hope in the long term.\"</p> <p>Efforts to develop a vaccine are under way at the Moredun Research Institute in Scotland, but it could be a decade before one is ready for use. Colin McInnes, of the institute, says: \"It is likely to be three years before we know if it is possible to protect red squirrels [with a vaccine], and longer still before it could be implemented.\"</p> <p>Until then, the only option is to step up \"control\" of greys. Brockbank admits: \"Control is a euphemism. It's extermination. We kill them.\" Habitat management is used too, but the prime defence against the grey menace, at least in England, is to throw up a ring of steel around each red squirrel colony. Some 16 such red refuges have been set up across the north of England, each surrounded by a 5km buffer zone, within which greys are targeted more than in other parts of the countryside.</p> <p>Carri Nicholson, of Save our Squirrels, a project run by Northumberland Wildlife Trust which coordinates protection for the reds, says landowners inside buffer zones can apply for funds to trap and kill greys. But not everybody approves. The idea that grey squirrels should be killed to protect reds is a long-running controversy in the UK. Nicholson admits that opinions on the issue are \"polarised\", but says some critics simply deny the evidence that greys are responsible for the pox. \"If you think climate change is bad, well welcome to the world of squirrels,\" she says. </p> <p><strong>Form of revenge</strong></p> <p>Some people opposed to the killing of greys, she claims, have even resorted to deliberately moving the animals, potentially diseased, into the centre of red squirrel colonies as a twisted form of revenge. \"We have reason to believe that is happening,\" Nicholson says. \"We have found greys where we were very surprised to find them.\" </p> <p>In his office at the Formby reserve, Brockbank is fighting a rearguard action against the encroaching greys. For decades, the habitat of the red squirrels has been relatively protected, on three sides by the sea and to the east by the manmade pine forest beyond the dunes (grey squirrels, in general, prefer broadleaf forests). In effect, this created an island on the mainland. But now that the virus has landed on the \"island\", the reds have nowhere to hide. The outlook is so grim that a proposal put to Liverpool University for a three-year PhD project to study the remaining reds and to work out a survival strategy is in doubt because there could be no animals left to study. </p> <p>\"People say we should move them, but where could they go?\" Brockbank says. Existing island populations of reds, such as on the Isle of Wight, are stable and should not be disturbed, he says. The Isle of Man has been suggested, but there is no evidence that squirrels have ever lived there, and ecologists are reluctant to take the risk of introducing them.</p> <p>But Brockbank remains optimistic. A handful of infected squirrels have reacted well to intensive drug therapy, while anecdotal reports could indicate a minor recovery in numbers. But Brockbank, his voice strained with emotion, says he is already forcing himself to consider a Formby without its most famous attraction. \"This is a beautiful place and it's very accessible, so I'm sure people will still come for a nice day out,\" he says. \"But will we see a return to the old days, with lots of red squirrels? I doubt it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25 2008. Formby is in Merseyside, not Lancashire as we said in the above article.

  "<p>The jury in the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes yesterday retraced his last steps and visited the headquarters of the police officers who shot him dead. The second day of the inquest saw the six women and five men hearing the case visit the underground station where he was killed on July 22 2005, after police mistook him for a suicide bomber. They were taken by coach to Stockwell tube station where the 27-year-old innocent Brazilian met his death.</p> <p>Court staff and the coroner, Sir Michael Wright, accompanied the jury as they went down the same escalator De Menezes used to get to the platform. He was shot seven times by two police officers while another held him in the seat of an underground train, after firearms officers came to the mistaken belief that he was a terrorist who had tried to bomb London's transport system the previous day.</p> <p>The jurors stood in silence for 30 seconds on the empty platform. The station was closed for a short time during the visit. Members of the De Menezes family, including cousins Patricia da Silva Armani and Alex Pereira, watched as the site visit took place. The jury then boarded three coaches and headed to Leman Street police station in east London, the base for the firearms officers who shot De Menezes.The officers had reported for duty at 7am on July 22, and were supposed to be at an address in south London which detectives believed was being used by a terrorist. Instead they were not in the right place for four hours.</p> <p>The three inquest coaches travelled on to Scotland Yard, from where the operation that led to the shooting was led, and then to Nightingale Lane police station and a Territorial Army base near De Menezes' home that were used as staging posts for the firearms team on the fateful day. </p> <p>The jury also visited the block of flats where De Menezes was living, and retraced his route from there to the tube station. Many Scotland Yard insiders fear a verdict of unlawful killing and embarrassing revelations during the inquest could cost Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Ian Blair his job.</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",
  "<p>The European commission yesterday opened a new front in its war with dominant mobile phone operators by proposing more price caps to slash the cost of sending texts, downloading data and making calls overseas.</p> <p>Viviane Reding, EU telecoms commissioner, said: \"We don't want to send operators out of business. Our price ceilings are very generous and no operator will be bankrupt because of these 'roaming' proposals.\"</p> <p>She was responding to fresh complaints from the GSM Association, representing big players such as Orange and Vodafone, that the European commission plans are \"politically motivated regulation\" and \"micro-management\" and will drive down revenue and stifle investment and innovation.</p> <p>Reding accused operators of failing to respond to her offer of a year's grace to cut text and data costs, and of continuing to levy excessive charges on consumers.</p> <p>\"We would have no need for micro-management at a political level if the industry had done its management at a commercial level,\" she replied, saying price caps on voice calls imposed since last year had been a zero-sum game - falling revenue among operators had been offset by increased traffic.</p> <p>Last year EU citizens sent 2.5bn SMS texts worth \u20ac800m (\u00a3634m) at an average cost of \u20ac0.29 each when travelling within Europe. The EC now proposes a retail cap of \u20ac0.11, excluding VAT, from July 1, 2009, with the wholesale cap set at \u20ac0.04.</p> <p>Amid reports that one consumer was charged \u20ac40,000 for downloading a TV show over a roaming line, the EC now proposes a \u20ac1 wholesale cap on data roaming compared with the current average of \u20ac5.40. </p> <p>And, in an effort to prevent \"bill-shock,\" it says consumers should be able, from July 1, 2010, to set their own bill limit in advance. The maximum price for making and receiving a call while travelling within the EU, cut to \u20ac0.46 and \u20ac0.22 respectively this summer, will drop to \u20ac0.34 and \u20ac0.10 by July 2012 under the EC's plans.</p> <p>These extend price regulation for a further three years until 2013 but Reding offered an olive branch to the industry by saying a policy review in 2011 could end regulation - if the industry had made genuine strides to create a competitive single market across the European Union. </p> <p>Meglena Kuneva, the EU consumer commissioner, said customers were being overcharged by 24% because operators bill per minute for overseas calls, but should bill per second after 30 seconds. \"It's like taking the train from Brussels to Paris and being charged to go to Rome,\" she said of this practice.</p> <p>Reding wants the legislation approved by next June but faces opposition among governments and MEPs, with the latter pressing for lower caps. </p> <p>Christian Salbaing, European managing director of smaller mobile operator 3, also urged the EC to slash the wholesale data cap further, saying that consumers would still pay 100 times more when overseas than at home.</p>",
  "<p>England's dismay over the flagging credibility of the International Cricket Council deepened further this week when 13 Bangladeshi professionals signed up to play Twenty20 for the unauthorised Indian Cricket League. It might not sound too disturbing at first sight, but the knock-on effects for England could be disastrous.</p> <p>From the ICC there was no emergency statement, merely the reminder that there was a committee which would consider such things. So Bangladesh went to Lalit Modi, the Indian businessman who to all intents and purposes now controls the world game. He promised them a greater share of India's Twenty20 riches. Bangladesh would be allowed to field a team in the Champions Twenty20 League and they would have greater opportunities, too, in the Indian Premier League, with their best players put up for auction.</p> <p>Modi was oblivious to the small matter that the IPL, provisionally scheduled for April-May 2010, will clash with Bangladesh's tour of England, just as the IPL clashes next year with a Sri Lanka tour that remains in confusion. Quite which Sri Lanka and Bangladesh players will be left to tour England is anybody's guess.</p> <p>Haroon Lorgat, the ICC's chief executive, recognises that the governing body faces one of its greatest ever challenges: to bring sense and stability to cricket's chaotic, unsustainable calendar. He tries to put a positive slant on the turmoil caused by Twenty20's rising popularity.</p> <p>\"Out of a difficult situation can come a lot of good,\" he said. \"If there wasn't an interest in the sport there wouldn't be so many challenges. I would rather come into a scenario where things are moving at great speed, with new forms of cricket and a new audience.</p> <p>\"Twenty20 is an opportunity that people have spotted they can take advantage of, but that doesn't detract from what has been agreed by all members that we will not sacrifice nation-v-nation cricket. Everyone recognises its importance. People are not disregarding it.</p> <p>\"All these tournaments are springing up and what we are trying to do is regulate them in a more effective way. A private businessman might have different ambitions but we have to protect the game of cricket.\"</p> <p>So far, for all Lorgat's talk, the ICC has simply surrendered to Indian machinations. The move away from Test cricket to an Indian-controlled future, based largely on club Twenty20, where they control 50% of the profits, looks unstoppable. England chose the moral high ground and walked away from such a deal; Australia and South Africa, desperate for a short-term solution to their ailing finances, capitulated.</p> <p>Lorgat believes that the trend can be slowed by four Test series in the next year, all of them involving Australia, who are in India for a four-Test series beginning next month, and who then play South Africa in home and away series before arriving in England for next summer's Ashes series.</p> <p>But international cricket is plagued by weak nations. Pakistan is blighted by terrorism - more than 50 people were killed in last weekend's bomb at the Islamabad Marriott, a hotel that Lorgat claimed was safe for this month's cancelled Champions Trophy. Zimbabwe, even given healthier political circumstances, would do well to recover in a generation. Bangladesh have been drained by Twenty20 as Sri Lanka could so easily be. South Africa will be debilitated by English county cricket unless the immigration authorities bow to ECB entreaties to toughen visa regulations - at least here the signs are promising.</p> <p>\"Transformation is something that has affected the entire globe in all areas: politics, cricket, whatever,\" Lorgat said. \"The world is a changed place. We have to learn to adapt. To say that the ICC is a mess is unfair. The ICC is a member-based organisation. People must understand that.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Guinness Premiership referee and a match citing officer were subjected to unprecedented criticism yesterday from English rugby's senior disciplinary official. The match officials were accused of incompetence and condemned for their handling of the incident which led to Wasps' England flanker James Haskell receiving a one-week ban for head-butting.</p> <p>It is not often a banned player receives more sympathy than those who landed him in the dock but Judge Jeff Blackett, the chairman of the Rugby Football Union's disciplinary panel, did not attempt to excuse the failure of the Leicestershire referee Martin Fox and citing officer Matt Bayliss to spot those chiefly responsible for the trouble which flared up in Wasps' game against Worcester 10 days ago. Fox's decision to penalise Phil Vickery following the incident, rather than the Worcester forwards Greg Rawlinson and Tom Wood, was described by Blackett as \"almost beyond comprehension\".</p> <p>Blackett and the three-man disciplinary panel were powerless to issue sanctions against the more serious culprits. \"This case has not been handled well by match officials or the citing officer,\" said Blackett. \"The referee was very close to the incident and must have had a clear view of what occurred yet he took no, or insufficient, disciplinary action. This is very disappointing given the recent IRB directive on 'clearing out' ... the first act by Wood, in which he jumped into Vickery with a swinging arm, is exactly the sort of action envisaged in and prohibited by the directive.</p> <p>\"Having not penalised Wood, the referee then observed Vickery grabbing Rawlinson by the scrum cap and dragging him into the ruck [the action which was subsequently penalised]. He then stood by as Rawlinson punched Vickery five times in and around the head, despite Haskell's request for intervention, and then observed Haskell clearing out Rawlinson by lunging towards him head first. Had the referee taken action against Wood initially none of the rest of the foul play would have followed. It is almost beyond comprehension that he then decided to penalise Vickery for the least of all of the acts of foul play.\"</p> <p>Fox, a 46-year-old property investment company director who has been a Premiership referee for six years, is due to control the televised Saracens v Northampton match at Vicarage Road on Saturday.</p> <p>Bayliss was criticised for his failure \"to describe adequately or properly the full extent of the various offences committed\" and also received strongly-worded criticism from Blackett. \"Although Haskell's citing was correct the citing officer should also have cited Rawlinson for punching and Wood for illegal clearing out. By failing to do so the panel were placed in the invidious position of taking disciplinary action against one person when other similar acts of foul play in the same incident will remain unpunished because the time limit for citing has passed.\"</p> <p>The panel decided Haskell had \"reacted to severe provocation\" and opted not to impose a lengthy ban. The Wasps lock Richard Birkett escaped with a reprimand, having been cited for stamping. Haskell will miss the game against Leicester at Welford Road on Friday and is also the subject of a complaint of foul play arising from Wasps' game at Northampton last Saturday. More than one allegation of gouging has been made against a Saints forward, with Haskell due to visit an eye specialist today to receive treatment for a scratched cornea. Last night he could not see out of the affected eye, four days after the incident.</p> <p>Wasps, without a win this season, will also have to face the undefeated Tigers without the hooker Joe Ward, whose injured shoulder will keep him out for at least two months. More encouraging news for the champions is that Danny Cipriani will return to action ahead of schedule, against Bath next Wednesday, less than five months after suffering a serious ankle injury against the same opponents in the play-offs.</p> <p>\"Danny has upped his training again this week and we'll see how he responds to that,\" said Wasps' director of rugby, Ian McGeechan.</p>",
  "<p>West Ham United are considering lodging a formal appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport against an independent tribunal's decision to rule in favour of Sheffield United over the Carlos Tevez affair, despite Football Association rules suggesting there was no further avenue for legal redress. It is understood West Ham will make a decision within 48 hours, with club officials holding talks with lawyers last night over whether to contest the award.</p> <p>The consequences of the tribunal's ruling could be severe, with Sheffield United, who were relegated on the final day of the 2006-07 season, demanding more than \u00a330m in compensation after the judgment found Tevez was worth at least three points to West Ham. Board members at Upton Park were said to be \"furious and surprised\" when informed of the decision on Friday.</p> <p>Whether the Court of Arbitration for Sport is an option remains to be seen but West Ham are questioning whether the FA's rule K5c - which states that by signing up to the independent tribunal \"the parties shall be deemed to have waived irrevocably any right to appeal, review or any recourse to a court of law\" - precludes challenging the ruling. Some legal experts suggested otherwise, however, leaving the club in an uneasy position before last night's Carling Cup defeat by the Championship's Watford.</p> <p>The verdict was a victory for the Sheffield United chairman, Kevin McCabe, who has spent the past 16 months campaigning for West Ham to face further punishment after they were found guilty of breaching rules in relation to the registration of Tevez and Javier Mascherano in April 2007. West Ham were fined \u00a35.5m by the FA but McCabe insisted points should have been docked and, after failing with an appeal, invoked an FA rule allowing clubs to go before an independent tribunal.</p> <p>Chaired by Lord Griffiths, the tribunal found that Tevez, who scored the goal that secured West Ham's survival on the final day of the season, was instrumental in keeping the club in the Premier League. The judgment suggested that without the Argentinian, West Ham would have \"achieved at least three points less overall\" and, as a consequence, would have been relegated to the Championship instead of Sheffield United.</p> <p>While Sheffield United have no chance of regaining their elite status as a result of the ruling, the club have demanded compensation in recognition of the money that has been lost through dropping into the Championship. McCabe had previously claimed relegation cost them \u00a350m but it is reported a figure of \u00a330,396,897.32 has been demanded to cover reduced television income, depreciating player values and a drop in merchandising sales.</p> <p>West Ham, furious that details of the ruling were leaked, dispute the fairness of that sum. Upton Park officials, who have rejected reports that players were sold last month because of the possible compensation claim, also believe the tribunal's ruling has set a dangerous precedent which could encourage other clubs to regularly contest decisions which are deemed to have affected their final league position.</p> <p>Few back West Ham's chances of overturning the ruling. \"My take is that West Ham have no right of appeal either to the English courts or the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" said Steven Friel, partner and expert in arbitration with Davies Arnold Cooper solicitors. \"The only way you could get before [CAS] would be if both sides agreed to that - and why would Sheffield United agree, because they have got the award they want?\"</p> <p>McCabe has refused to comment other than to confirm the ruling found in favour of Sheffield United, although not everyone has been so circumspect. Neil Warnock, who was in charge when the Blades slipped into the Championship, has pointed the finger at the Premier League, and in particular the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, for failing to impose a stiffer punishment on West Ham before.</p> <p>\"Richard Scudamore should look in the mirror,\" said Warnock, who felt that the chief executive probably thought \"it was little Sheffield United, no one gave a hoot. Now it has been dealt with by an independent panel he has no influence over. I am delighted.\"</p>",
  "<p>The first job of a party leader's speech is that it should satisfy the party, and yesterday Gordon Brown did that. He spoke magnificently for the first five minutes and convincingly from then on, reminding his party of the hopes it once placed in his leadership. As a result, he emerges from Labour's Manchester conference stronger than many had predicted. But however warm he made the party feel yesterday, it is too soon to say whether this strength will survive exposure to a colder world outside the hall. </p> <p>He began by staking Labour's future as a party of government on its ability to answer the financial crisis. He addressed it more coherently than any British politician so far, offering a list of good proposals for reform. They supported his claim that the government will be the \"rock of stability\" on which people can depend. He spoke to the moment, as the Conservatives have so noticeably failed to do, even if he felt the need to distort a quote from the shadow chancellor in order to do it. Sadly Mr Brown retreated after this to a familiar and less interesting routine, leaving his initial offer of \"a new settlement\" sounding more expedient than heartfelt.</p> <p>Having set out the idea that the world had changed, and Labour had to change with it, he offered few ideas as to how he might manage this other than continue as leader. \"We haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution,\" he said of the City crisis. Britain, he was saying, needs the same Gordon Brown to handle a changed world, rather than a changed Gordon Brown to handle the same world. </p> <p>He found comfort in his old language, about Britain and Britishness, of the kind that tainted his conference speech last year. At least there was little of the boastfulness which made that speech so unsuccessful. His tone was modest and even apologetic, helped by a fiercely controlled slow delivery. He managed to strip away some of the artifice of his first year in power, revealing a clearer leader beneath. His party might ask itself why it has taken him a year to set out his ideas in a credible way. But it liked what it heard. This speech was well crafted for its audience and its warm reception in the hall was real.</p> <p>Mr Brown's task yesterday was political. He had to ensure his own survival, in the face of a mutinous party and ministers who struggled this week to hide their lack of respect. He tied the cabinet to his cause by listing their names, and targeted his enemies with clever jibes. \"This is no time for a novice,\" he said as television cameras cut away to David Miliband - but that line worked for the Conservatives too. His attack on the Tories was the sharpest this week, drawing a skilful contrast between Labour's achievements and the threats to them from Conservative rule.</p> <p>This was not a natural speech for Mr Brown to make, forced on him by circumstances that he must find painful. He was introduced by his wife Sarah, an innovation borrowed from America which worked, just about, because what she said about her respect for him was true. The prime minister came close to admitting his error over the 10 pence tax rate, and though he stopped short of an apology it was enough for him to restate Labour's goals. This was not a speech for new policies, though there were hints of them on childcare and a promise to pass a law against child poverty - a tactic to expose the Tories (who may vote against) rather than a sensible use of parliament's time.</p> <p>The prime minister regards his opponents as frivolous, and sees himself as a force to be trusted in difficult times. It is a reasonable claim and if, in the next few months, the polls show that voters have begun to agree then yesterday's speech will be seen as the start of the recovery. Labour, at least, shared Mr Brown's analysis yesterday. For a leader in trouble, that is something to celebrate - but he should not mistake it for more than a qualified reprieve.</p>",
  "<p>Those of us who have long argued for a significant level of devolution from Whitehall to town halls sometimes face a dilemma in a country without a written constitution, and consequently no defined boundaries between central and local government. We believe that a progressive national government will balance strengthened town, city and neighbourhood democracy with the state setting national standards in, say, health, social care, education and community safety to ensure that services are evenly spread.</p> <p>Like it or not, that requires national inspectorates to maintain equity between areas. The danger comes when a more reactionary government exploits devolution as a cover for reducing the role of the state, perhaps as a pretext for sweeping economies in the caring services and elsewhere. </p> <p>Next week, at the Conservatives' annual conference, we will doubtless be hearing about the need to set councils and communities free from Whitehall control - about the centralised state bearing down on citizens and threatening local democracy. </p> <p>New localism is in fashion. But we should beware. While some Tory local authorities offer a level of service, care and efficiency that could be a template, others see their role as light-touch organisations, putting economy ahead of caring.</p> <p>This is not to suggest that all Labour or Liberal Democrat councils are model authorities. Lib Dem Liverpool, condemned by the Audit Commission this year for its financial incompetence and political in-fighting, needs help. Last week, a Health is Wealth Commission in the city produced measures to improve the wellbeing of a million people in a conurbation where life expectancy is seven years shorter than parts of the south-east. Its chair, Sue Woodward, spoke of generations of families dependent on benefits, spiralling problems with obesity and alcohol misuse, and an \"invisible army of people ... cut off from the opportunities being created on their own doorstep\". With the city in political and financial chaos, someone has to intervene with the commission. It can only be the state as the social champion of last resort.</p> <p>This week, in an interview with Society Guardian, communities secretary Hazel Blears warns of the dangers from a Conservative government intent on cutting back further on the Audit Commission's inspection regime. \"Why have government if it is not about ... saying we need more homes, better social care and health?\" she says.</p> <p>Her point is that greater devolution, in the wrong hands, can be regressive, a cover for cuts in the caring services. Could David Cameron's new-found enthusiasm for the third sector mean the state pulling back from supporting all manner of programmes by off-loading responsibilities to social enterprises and charities? Of course, while he might deny any such intent, those radical elements of the party associated with neocons in the US see the charitable sector as preferable to social care provided by the state.</p> <p>Yet, in the deepening global financial crisis, the case for a stronger state - building more social homes, rescuing some householders in negative equity and helping those on low incomes meet fuel bills - grows stronger each day. It is simply unacceptable for Conservatives to argue that the state has no role in setting, say, housebuilding levels, and other targets, on the grounds that councils should decide numbers. </p> <p>It also has another role: ensuring, through the inspection regime, that councils and NHS trusts are run efficiently and fairly. That does not mean mindless political intervention. It might, in the case of the NHS, mean enhanced local democracy. But it should also mean that someone is there to pick up the pieces, in a city like Liverpool, when all else fails. Unless we want to descend to the social inequity of the US, that has to be the state.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Hetherington writes on communities and regeneration.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Wong Kar-Wai's Ashes of Time Redux continues the vogue for director's cuts. When did it start?</strong><br> Malcolm Smith, Cromer</p> <p>The first film-makers had sufficient control over their work to release their preferred versions. But the formalisation of the business in the mid-1910s gave production companies, distributors and exhibitors a say in the content and length of release prints. DW Griffith, for example, produced an eight-hour rough cut of Intolerance (1916) and considered issuing it in two parts. Yet, even though he was persuaded to cut the picture to around 200 minutes, it was deemed overlong and its box-office failure prompted Griffith to hack into the negative and release The Mother and the Law and The Fall of Babylon as separate items to recoup his losses. Unfortunately, when he later attempted to reconstruct the original, 2,000 feet had been permanently lost. </p> <p>Erich von Stroheim's Greed (1924) suffered an even worse fate. The rough cut ran for 45 or 42 reels, depending on which source you believe. However, Samuel Goldwyn rejected this nine-hour version and insisted Von Stroheim further reduce his 22-reel revision. Even the 18-reel, two-part compromise prepared with fellow director Rex Ingram failed to please and MGM wunderkind Irving G Thalberg sanctioned a 10-reel hatchet job by title writer Joseph Farnham and the destruction of the excised footage. </p> <p>The first director's cuts of the sound era emerged in the early 1930s, when Griffith added sound effects to his contentious 1915 masterpiece The Birth of a Nation and Abel Gance transformed Napoleon (1927) into Napoleon Bonaparte (1934) with some sound effects, dubbed dialogue and several new scenes. But many years were to pass before a director again had such autonomy over his work. Perhaps surprisingly, the modern trend for director's cuts begins with John Cassavetes. In 1959, he salvaged scenes from a discarded 1957 version of his directorial debut, Shadows, while in 1978, he cut 26 minutes from the 134-minute 1976 print of The Killing of a Chinese Bookie. But rather than simply removing or truncating footage, Cassavetes reshaped the material and added new scenes to alter both the film's thematic and stylistic emphasis.</p> <p><strong>Last week you said The Rice-Irwin Kiss contained the first female close-up. I always thought it came in Grandma's Reading Glass.</strong><br> Mitch O'Neal, Connah's Quay</p> <p>Probably starring Eva Bayley and Tom Green, George Albert Smith's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_89uZv5_pQ\">Grandma's Reading Glass (1900)</a> contains what is presumed to be the earliest example of a female close-up in a projected film, and even then we only see the right eye of the old woman being scrutinised by a young boy with a magnifying glass. One of the first to attempt point-of-view shots, this short film has been the subject of much debate, with some historians claiming it as the work of Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337903536\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/kobal_grable140.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Grable\" width=\"140\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Million dollar legs ...

During Hollywood's golden age, Fred Astaire, Sonja Henie, Lana Turner and Ann Miller all had their legs insured for sizeable sums, but none could match the $1.25m policy that 20th Century-Fox took out on Betty Grable, who was subsequently billed as \"The Girl with the Million Dollar Legs\". </p> <p>In ensuing decades, Marlene Dietrich had her voice insured for $1m, but Jimmy Durante's schnozzle nose was only valued at $50,000, while Bette Davis had to settle for a $28,000 payout against excessive weight gain.

They had a clear image of the prime minister, he would be: solid, anchored in moral purpose, a heavyweight able to punch the light out of the Tories - and with a reddish tinge which meant he stood, even if not openly, to the left of Tony Blair.</p> <p>That was the Gordon Brown the Labour faithful hoped they were getting 15 months ago. In the past year, many had almost forgotten him, as a different character seemed to take up residence in Downing Street: Bottler Brown, the ditherer who ducked an election and took from the poor with a scrapped 10p tax rate, who could barely speak like a human being and who watched, paralysed, as a 12-point Labour lead turned into a 20-point deficit.</p> <p>But for one sweet hour yesterday afternoon that man was banished, replaced by the Gordon Brown Labour once yearned for. In a speech performed with greater skill than any of his previous efforts - the cadences rising and falling in the right places, the high-volume, machine gun delivery ditched - the prime minister reminded the Labour party of why they had once admired him so much.</p> <p>The improvement began even before he had appeared. In a surprise piece of stagecraft, his wife Sarah came to the podium to rapturous applause - one of several elements yesterday borrowed from the recently-completed US convention season. Like Michelle Obama or Cindy McCain, she testified to her husband's devotion to public service. Her unflashiness, the sense that she has endured tough times as well as good, threw a kind of protective layer over the PM: he gained credit by association.</p> <p>Brown built on that, insisting \"I'm serious about doing a serious job.\" Riskily, given that he had just deployed his own wife, he bragged that he had not \"served up my children for spreads in the papers\" - a clear dig at David Cameron, who is often photographed with his family - because \"My children aren't props; they're people.\" It was a return to the message he had sought to convey in that distant summer of 2007: not flash, just Gordon.</p> <p>He marched on determined to retake the moral high ground. Speaking more personally than usual, he offered a quasi-apology for the 10p tax error, saying he was \"stung\" by the accusation that he was no longer \"on the side of hard-working families\", vowing that from now on \"it's the only place I ever will be\".</p> <p>He borrowed a line from Barack Obama's convention speech to ram home the point: \"This job is not about me. It's about you.\" More surprisingly, Brown cast himself as a Scottish Sarah Palin, adapting one of her signature lines, though with Fife in place of Alaska and Westminster in place of Washington: \"I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted to - and want to - change it.\"</p> <p>But Brown's chief effort was to push the image of himself which, during those first three months in Number 10, had begun to take root in the public mind, before it was so pushed aside. He would be \"the rock of stability\".</p> <p>Brown will hope this stems the decline in his standing but that was not his primary purpose yesterday. With talk throughout the conference of a plot against him - the only issue being when, not if, he would be toppled - addressing the wider public was a luxury. He had to win over the hall.</p> <p>He did that by returning to what had been old form, staking out territory to the left of the Blairite project. Never mind that he had been the co-architect of New Labour, a favourite Brown manoeuvre was always to tickle the erogenous zones of the Labour faithful, serving up some old-time religion.</p> <p>Yesterday he did that by promising a \"new settlement for new times\", a shift to reflect the convulsions in the world economy. Now the market would be returned to its rightful place as a servant of the people - never its master. In a sentence which delighted his audience, he declared: \"Those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong.\"</p> <p>All week the conference fringe has hummed with similar sentiments, as Labour folk have seized on the collapse and bailout of the big banks as evidence that the neo-liberal era is over. Yesterday, Brown was keen to ride that wave.</p> <p>So he spoke of freeing agency workers from \"the scourge of exploitation\" and laid into the traders guilty of \"reckless speculation.\"</p> <p>That's not language that often passed the lips of Tony Blair. That it comes easily to Gordon Brown was one reason why he was able to remain as Labour's heir apparent for so long. Indeed, he turned to Red Gordon to get him out of trouble many times in the past and did so again yesterday.</p> <p>The politics are not hard to fathom. Brown hopes that by securing his left flank, he can cast himself as the more appealing alternative to any putative rival, who would swiftly be branded as \"Blairite\" and on the party's right. He knows that the trade unions are not impressed by David Miliband: in yesterday's speech Brown sent the message that in any future choice, they should stick with him.</p> <p>That was not the only way in which the he pushed back at those conspiring for his removal. The public \"would not forgive us\", he said, if Labour was to turn inward during the economic storm. This is proving to be one of Brown's sharpest weapons: the claim that to leave the country leaderless during such a crisis would spook the markets and anger the voters.</p> <p>But the moment that caught the attention - as it was surely designed to - was a line officially directed at the Conservatives but with a handy double meaning. \"I'm all in favour of apprenticeships,\" he said, \"but this is no time for a novice.\" The TV cameras instantly cut to Miliband's forced smile as the Brown camp knew they would.</p> <p>Not that the Tories escaped a pounding. Brown attacked them more potently than he has managed since becoming prime minister. He won gasps when he quoted George Osborne (not accurately it emerged later) declaring it was financial markets' job to make money out of the \"misery of others\".</p> <p>There was still some confusion on precisely how to attack the Tories: whether to accept that they have changed, conceding that they now have genuinely progressive intentions - but are not ready to support the means to those progressive ends - or whether to argue that the change is merely cosmetic. In the end, Brown did a bit of both.</p> <p>Still, this was more like the great clunking fist Brown had promised and which he had not yet bared. It gave Labour heart that, if Brown carried on like this, he might just rescue himself - and them.</p> <p>There were longueurs in the speech, especially in the middle, during what even his own aides described as \"the policy slab.\" And while he offered a sketch of what needed to be done to cure the global financial system, the speech was short on the domestic steps Brown plans to take. The policy proposals were all relatively small-bore: not quite lagging on pipes, but home internet and personal tutors for kids rather than an overhaul of the economy. </p> <p>Still, it's not on policy proposals that a speech such as this is judged. It's on the intangible, almost emotional sense that lingers once it's over. Brown needed to leave his audience with the gut belief that he's not done for just yet, that he could still come back. He did that yesterday. But it will have been for nothing if it ends there. As one cabinet colleague said, he needs to do that \"every day, every week from now on\".</p> <p>He has to kill off the man he has been for the last year - and bring back the Gordon Brown his party once dreamed of.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Q</strong> My two-bed house has been on the market since December 2007, so doesn't need a home information pack (Hip). My estate agent now tells me I need an energy performance certificate (EPC) as a result of new legislation that takes effect on October 1. I think it is confusing this with the new requirement for landlords to have an EPC. Can you advise?<br><strong>AM</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> According to information from the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk\">communities and local government department</a> your estate agent is right. From October 1 2008, an EPC will be required whenever a building is built, sold or rented. This includes properties already on the market, so even if you escape needing to have a Hip because your house was put on the market before December 14 2007, you will still need to get an EPC. </p> <p>An EPC is automatically included in the cost of producing a Hip, but it will cost about \u00a3100 to get an EPC on its own.</p>",
  "<p>It would seem that Jacqui Smith has the right idea but the wrong policy to address street prostitution (Total ban for sex soliciting and kerb-crawling, September 22). Although research indicates that male kerb crawlers can be deterred, toughening up the laws on kerb crawling will probably make little difference. The limited effectiveness of the existing legislation is more to do with its enforcement. Policing street prostitution is very time consuming, while in many locations it is not a police priority. Changing the legislation alone will not alter this.</p> <p>A more constructive approach would be to put more effort into helping those women who want to leave prostitution. Many of the women who work on the street are problematic drug users and have histories of abuse, marginalisation and homelessness, as well as problems of mental and physical health. Many want to do something more constructive with their lives. But most need support to turn their lives around and this requires time and resources. Following the murders in Ipswich in December 2006, a personalised management plan was introduced which sought to address these women's needs, and the council, together with the key agencies, has provided routes out of this damaging and dangerous occupation. In 2006 there were approximately 30 women working on the streets of Ipswich; now there are two or three. Consequently, street prostitution has been virtually removed from this location. This is the model of practice that all urban areas where street prostitution is an issue should be emulating.</p> <p><strong>Professor Roger Matthews</strong><br>London South Bank University</p>",
  "<p>Italy ordered the deployment of 500 soldiers yesterday to tackle violent crime in response to the mafia killings of six African migrants near Naples last week.</p> <p>Ignazio La Russa, the defence minister, said the majority of the troops would be sent to the area around Casal di Principe, home to the Casalesi clan, the most feared grouping within the Naples Camorra, which is suspected of 10 other killings this year. Last week's murders led to rioting by migrants in the area.</p> <p>The troops will staff checkpoints for three months alongside 400 extra police drafted into the area on Monday. About 3,000 soldiers were deployed earlier this year as part of an anti-crime drive in big cities and their mandate was renewed for another six months yesterday.</p> <p>The deployment of soldiers to the Naples hinterland is the first time the army has been used to specifically target the mafia since 1992, when troops were sent to Sicily following the murders of anti-mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. \"We need to put into play everything that can be useful in resolving the problem,\" said Piero Grasso, an anti-mafia prosecutor.</p> <p>But Marina Sereni, the deputy opposition whip in parliament, said the government was sending in troops while \"cutting funds to the police and abandoning whole areas of our country to organised crime\".</p> <p>The Casalesi clan has created a fiefdom in the small towns north of Naples through the illegal dumping of toxic waste and construction. </p> <p>Nigerian gangs have allied with the clan to deal drugs in the area, but the newspaper La Stampa said those shot dead last week in Castelvolturno were law-abiding migrants, targeted randomly \"to sow terror\" among foreign workers. </p> <p>Police arrested Alfonso Cesarano, 29, on Monday on suspicion of taking part in the murders, saying that he was already under house arrest for a drug related offence.</p> <p>The murders would mark a departure for the Casalesi, who have traditionally kept a low profile. A number of arrests and revelations by turncoats have reportedly weakened the clan. </p> <p>Bosses have also been given unwelcome publicity by Roberto Saviano's bestseller Gomorra, which was filmed and won the Grand Jury prize at Cannes this year.</p> <p>Saviano, who is under police protection, made a front page appeal in La Repubblica on Monday to people living under the Casalesi. </p> <p>\"For months and months a group of killers has moved without restraint, massacring innocent people,\" he wrote. \"How do you feel when you go to work, go for a walk, make love? Do you worry about this, or is it enough to say 'It was always like this and it will always be like this'?\"</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration's proposed $700bn bail-out of cash-strapped Wall Street banks received a rancorous hearing in Congress yesterday as politicians demanded safeguards, extra details and more time to scrutinise the way the Treasury intends to spend the money.</p> <p>Under questioning by the Senate banking committee, treasury secretary Henry Paulson clashed repeatedly with congressmen as he admitted that he had only a rough idea of how his department would price and purchase toxic mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>Paulson, appearing alongside the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben Bernanke, resisted calls to crack down on excessive Wall Street pay packages but gave ground on providing aid to homeowners and allowing an independent board to scrutinise the planned fund's investments.</p> <p>Describing this summer's financial crisis as \"embarrassing for the United States of America\", Paulson said \"thousands\" of banks would be eligible to sell assets to the government. </p> <p>\"This is all about the American taxpayer - that's all we care about,\" said Paulson. \"This is not something I ever wanted to ask for but it's better than the alternative.\"</p> <p>At one point, his comments were jeered by protesters who held up signs saying \"no Paulson plunder\" and \"no blank check\". But Paulson's words were echoed by Bernanke, who gave a blunt warning that the US faces a prolonged recession unless the government acts: \"If the credit markets are not functioning, jobs will be lost, unemployment will rise, more homes will be foreclosed upon and GDP will contract.\"</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats expressed grave reservations about the plan, complaining that they were being asked to legislate in a hurry for a huge amount of money to be spent on an \"experiment\".</p> <p>\"Why do we have one week to decide on $700bn that has to be appropriated or our country's financial system goes down the pipes?\" Jon Tester, a Democratic senator, asked.</p> <p>From the opposite end of the political spectrum, conservative Republican Jim Bunning, said: \"This massive bail-out is not a solution. It is financial socialism and it's un-American.\"</p> <p>Legislators pointed out that they initially received only a three-page summary of how the government's intervention will work. They questioned how the Treasury would determine the price it will pay for obscure mortgage-backed derivatives which have been all but abandoned by the financial markets.</p> <p>Paulson said he anticipated some form of \"reverse auction\" whereby banks would compete to sell unwanted securities for the lowest price. But the process would require \"experimentation\" and he promised the Treasury would recruit experts to help.</p> <p>\"This is not a situation where we can come and say, 'This is what we want to do, this is how we're going to price it and this is how the reverse auctions are going to work,'\" Paulson told the committee. \"We've said upfront we're going to need some experimentation.\"</p> <p>That left many senators dissatisfied. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, said: \"You're flying by the seat of your pants. You want the capital to be there but you're not quite sure what you're going to do with it.\" A Republican, Mike Enzi, asked: \"Shouldn't we have the process designed before we have to do a $700bn experiment?\"</p> <p>The pricing mechanism is widely considered to be critical. If the treasury pays too little for securities, the banks could still collapse. If it pays too much, the government will be unable to sell them on, landing taxpayers with huge liabilities.</p> <p>After initially asking for virtually unchecked power, Paulson has agreed in principle to the creation of a board to oversee investments. He has also suggested he is open to some form of aid for struggling homeowners as part of the package.</p> <p>But the administration continues to balk at introducing any legislative curbs on Wall Street salaries. Paulson, who earned up to $30m annually when heading Goldman Sachs, said compensation was an issue to be dealt with separately.</p> <p>\"I've heard your concerns on executive compensation and I share those frustrations,\" he said, adding that he was equally \"upset\" by certain examples of excess.</p> <p>The emergency package has prompted vigorous reactions around the world. The Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, pointed out this week that the bail-out would cost four times the amount his nation produces in a year. He described the financial turmoil as a sign that his \"21st century socialism\" was the way forward.</p> <p>Democrats have suggested that the government take equity stakes in return for aid to banks. Christopher Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the banking committee, expressed fears about the precedent set by the package: \"I can only conclude that it's not only our economy that's at risk but our constitution as well.\"</p> <p><strong>What they said</strong></p> <p>\"I believe if the credit markets are not functioning, that jobs will be lost, that our credit rate will rise, more houses will be foreclosed upon, GDP will contract, that the economy will just not be able to recover in a normal, healthy way.\" <br><strong>Ben Bernanke</strong></p> <p>\"You worry about taxpayers being on the hook? Guess what - they're already on the hook.\" <br><strong>Henry Paulson</strong></p> <p>\"This massive bail-out is not a solution. It is financial socialism and it's un-American.\" <br><strong>Senator Jim Bunning, Republican</strong></p>",
  "<p>The South American republic of Ecuador will next week consider what many countries in the world would say is unthinkable. People will be asked to vote on Sunday on a new constitution that would give Ecuador's tropical forests, islands, rivers and air similar legal rights to those normally granted to humans. If they vote yes - and polls show that 56% are for and only 23% are against - then an already approved bill of rights for nature will be introduced, and new laws will change the legal status of nature from being simply property to being a right-bearing entity.</p> <p>The proposed bill states: \"Natural communities and ecosystems possess the unalienable right to exist, flourish and evolve within Ecuador. Those rights shall be self-executing, and it shall be the duty and right of all Ecuadorian governments, communities, and individuals to enforce those rights.\"</p> <p>Thomas Linzey, a US lawyer who has helped to develop the new legal framework for nature, says: \"The dominant form of environmental protection in industrialised countries is based on the regulatory system. Governments permit and legalise the discharge of certain amounts of toxics into the environment. As a form of environmental protection, it's not working. </p> <p>\"In the same way, compensation is measured in terms of that injury to a person or people. Under the new system, it will be measured according to damage to the ecosystem. The new system is, in essence, an attempt to codify sustainable development. The new laws would grant people the right to sue on behalf of an ecosystem, even if not actually injured themselves.\"</p> <p>Until now, all legal frameworks have been anthropocentric, or people-based. To file an environmental lawsuit requires a person to provide evidence of personal injury. This can be extremely difficult. To provide a conclusive link, say, between a cancer and polluted drinking water is, legally speaking, virtually impossible. </p> <p>The origins of this apparent legal tidal shift lie in Ecuador's growing disillusionment with foreign multinationals. The country, which contains every South American ecosystem within its borders, which include the Galapagos Islands, has had disastrous collisions with multi-national companies. Many, from banana companies to natural gas extractors, have exploited its natural resources and left little but pollution and poverty in their wake.</p> <p>Now it is in the grip of a bitter lawsuit against US oil giant Chevron, formerly Texaco, over its alleged dumping of billions of gallons of crude oil and toxic waste waters into the Amazonian jungle over two decades.</p> <p>It is described as the Amazonian Chernobyl, and 30,000 local people claim that up to 18m tonnes of oil was dumped into unlined pits over two decades, in defiance of international guidelines, and contaminating groundwater over an area of some 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) and leading to a plethora of serious health problems for anyone living in the area. Chevron has denied the allegations. In April, a court-appointed expert announced in a report that, should Chevron lose, it would have to pay up to $16bn (\u00a38.9bn) in damages.</p> <p>Chevron, which claims its responsibilities were absolved in 1992 when it handed over its operations in Ecuador to the state-owned extraction company, Petroecuador, immediately set about discrediting the report. A verdict on the case is still thought to be a long way off, and Ecuador's government could face US trade sanctions for its refusal to \"kill\" the case.</p> <p>Environmental campaigner Zoe Tryon, of the Pachamama Alliance, which has worked closely with Ecuador's assembly, claims that the proposed new laws will make Ecuador's constitution \"the most progressive in the world\", and argues that such laws will prevent this situation from arising again. \"It's too late for the Chevron case, but it will be an effective deterrent for similar operations,\" she says.</p> <p>The laws would have particular relevance in the Yasuni national park, one of the world's most biodiverse areas and home to at least two \"uncontacted\" Amazonian tribes. It is also \"home\" to a possible 1.2bn barrels of untapped crude oil, which companies want to extract.</p> <p>\"The hope is that the new laws will give us unprecedented legal muscle to protect areas like this where there are competing interests,\" says Linda Siegele, a lawyer for the UK-based Foundation for International Environmental Law and Development. </p> <p>Linzey admits that Ecuador may be taking a step into the legal unknown. \"No one knows what will happen [if the referendum goes in favour of new rights for nature] because there are no examples of how this works in the real world,\" he says. \"A lot of people will be watching what happens.\"</p>",

  "<p>A common complaint among football managers concerns the countless phone calls they have to field from often overly \"hands-on\" chairmen, owners and chief executives. It is a phenomenon Chris Hughton has yet to encounter at Newcastle United. Indeed, the club's caretaker manager could be forgiven for wondering if the St James' Park board actually has his mobile number.</p> <p>Since being installed as Kevin Keegan's temporary successor Hughton has had minimal contact with Mike Ashley, Derek Llambias and Dennis Wise, Newcastle's owner, managing director and director of football respectively. Asked yesterday if anyone in authority had spoken to him in the wake of Saturday's 3-1 defeat at West Ham, Hughton replied: \"No, not at all.\"</p> <p>Newcastle have a Carling Cup tie at home to Tottenham Hotspur tonight but he has not been informed if any director will be in attendance, let alone offered insights into the search for Keegan's permanent replacement or ongoing efforts to find someone willing to buy Ashley out. \"No, I've been told nothing,\" he admitted. \"I've had no indication about anything.\"</p> <p>With Ashley, Llambias and Wise having disappeared in the wake of fans' protests against their regime and last week's disastrous attempt to sell Newcastle in Dubai, Hughton is left as the public face of a club now regarded as \"a distressed brand\" by business experts.</p> <p>Judging by yesterday's dignified, courteous and occasionally amusing performance at a media conference that others in his position might have ducked, he is presenting the most stoic front possible. \"No, I don't see it as the hardest job in football,\" he said. \"I'm quite enjoying it.\"</p> <p>If Hughton, thus far, is betraying no sign of being aged by his responsibilities - despite heading towards his 50th birthday, his looks are sufficiently boyish for one reporter to inquire if he had considered solving Newcastle's problems at full- back by re-registering himself as a player - no amount of airbrushing can disguise the club's current travails.</p> <p>Behind the scenes it is understood that certain senior players are not so keen to toe the \"company man\" line and remain angry that no one has bothered to brief them on the turbulence of the past three weeks. Hughton, though, remains resolutely sanguine. \"Anything that is above me is something I can't control,\" he said. \"All I can control is this group of players. At this particular moment we just don't know what's going to happen.\"</p> <p>Footballers detest uncertainty and, in the wake of three straight defeats, Michael Owen yesterday admitted: \"We are all feeling it at the moment. We all liked Kevin Keegan and were sad to see him go. We are as much in the dark as the fans about the next move and it does not make it any easier that Kevin Keegan was very popular.\"</p> <p>If Newcastle's players and fans are struggling to adapt to life after Keegan, Hughton faced a far greater shock a year ago. Then Tottenham's No2, he was unceremoniously sacked along with Martin Jol, thereby paving the way for the Juande Ramos era.</p> <p>Leaving was a huge wrench but he does not do bitterness. \"Yes, I'll be having a drink with Juande afterwards,\" he said. \"Spurs was a big part of my life but I left on good terms and I got a magnificent position here.\" Wingers who played against Hughton say that his game had edge but any spikiness was clearly reserved purely for the pitch. </p> <p>Accordingly there was not the merest hint of schadenfreude in the caretaker's voice when he discussed a start to the season in which the Carling Cup holders have looked even worse than Newcastle.</p> <p>\"I'm surprised,\" he reflected. \"But Spurs have got more than enough quality to make real progress and I'm sure they will.\"</p> <p>His current team's prognosis appears rather less certain.</p>",
  "<p>On the whole, I can't complain too much about the readers who respond to my column online. The great majority present their argument in more or less temperate terms. Most of them take issue with my point of view, which is how it should be. Many support their case with helpful and relevant information. So far, so civilised - the correct use of a blog. A minority express their opposition by way of abuse, very personal remarks and hysterical ranting, but I've had it far easier than many of my colleagues. I seriously considered suing one commenter for libel; I would have won, and English law, for purposes of libel litigation, allows the real identity behind an online pseudonym to be discovered. </p> <p>It is that anonymity that's at the hub of a debate and vote that takes place in the European Parliament tomorrow. An Estonian MEP, Marianne Mikko, is worried that a growing number of blogs are written with \"malicious intentions or hidden agendas\". She proposes that bloggers identify themselves and declare any interests they have in the issue they're writing about. Her concerns should be taken seriously. We, the readers of blogs, do not, and normally cannot, know who lurks behind the funny nickname. We need more information about the writers so that we can decide how seriously to take their opinions. Has she a personal stake in whatever it is under discussion? Does he belong to a dodgy or extreme campaigning body? Is she the sister of the owner of the restaurant she's recommending? Does he bear a personal grudge? We don't know. </p> <p>Coincidentally, last week, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the world wide web, confessed to his own worries about the way his invention was being used to dispense disinformation, conspiracy theories (that 9/11 was the work of the US government, for example) and harmful ideas. He particularly mentioned the spreading of the rumours that the MMR vaccine risked leading to autism in children. Also, he said, \"the thinking of cults can spread very rapidly and suddenly a cult which was 12 people who had some deep personal issues suddenly finds a formula which is very believable ... which you can imagine spreading to thousands of people and being deeply damaging.\" His solution - systems that would give a website a label of trustworthiness once it had proved the reliability of its sources - was less convincing. </p> <p>For the moment, the advantages of allowing virtually unrestricted access to the net outweigh the undoubted negatives mentioned by Mikko and Berners-Lee. But what's also clear is that more and more participants are abusing that freedom, whether as bloggers or on websites. We may soon have to consider devising controls on entry, though what form they'll take is not easy to envisage. It is possible that we will find out, in five or 10 or 20 years, that, in the internet, we have created a monster we cannot tame, whose capacity for doing harm exceeds any good it once brought. </p> <p><strong>Listening to the BBC World Service news bulletin the </strong>other night I was told that a sheet of music written by \"the composer Mozart\" had been discovered in a library in France. This upset me for a quite a while. Did they really need to tell listeners that Mozart was a composer? (The serious press here and the BBC home channels didn't.) Would there be anyone so ignorant of Mozart's calling as to require an explanation? I gave the World Service the benefit of the doubt. After all, a large proportion of its listenership comes from countries not steeped in the European classical music tradition. Still, its listeners are intelligent and knowledgeable - they have chosen to tune in to one of the highest-quality stations in the world - and I would have thought that, for them, the greatest of the great, whether in history or still living, and in whatever field of endeavour they exhibited their supremacy, would require no descriptive noun. </p> <p>There are not all that many in that category: Mozart and Beethoven, Mandela, Einstein, Muhammad Ali, Shakespeare, perhaps a few more. It may be that the World Service has noticed a trend, veering towards greater ignorance, and is right to label even Mozart. Such a trend may be universal. I'm depressingly conscious that, as surveys continue to show, British youth's knowledge of important historical events and characters is abysmal; if they have so little idea who Winston Churchill was, can we expect them to know Mozart? And why should the youth of other countries fare better? Perhaps, quite soon, references in the serious media to all the great figures will have to be explained.</p> <p>At least the World Service didn't describe him as the \"famous composer Mozart\". When I worked for the Times some years ago, it was forbidden to describe someone as the \"famous\" (or \"celebrated\" or \"well-known\") writer, composer or whatever. If they are genuinely famous, there is no need for the adjective; if they're not, the adjective is a lie. I remember too that, until quite recently, you could tell from the wording of a London Evening Standard billboard whether or not someone who had just died was truly well-known. If it proclaimed \"Famous actor dies\" you knew you probably hadn't heard of the deceased. A really famous person would have his or her name in the huge letters of the billboard: \"Lord Olivier dies\". The adjective \"famous\" would have been regarded as patronising. </p> <p><strong>This week Marcel saw</strong> the musical Zorro, based on the fictional adventure of the black-caped and masked do-gooder of Spanish California: \"A beguiling mix of terrific flamenco dancing and singing, the Gipsy Kings' music and exuberant action.\" <strong>He watched all of</strong> Thabo Mbeki's resignation speech: \"With sadness. He should have done so much more for his country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Like a theatrical equivalent of David Dimbleby, Harley Granville-Barker's play Waste has a habit of popping up at times of great political importance. The last major British revival of the 1907 drama - in which a party leader's attempt to form a government is thwarted by factionalism and scandal - took place in 1997, as the collapsing Major adminstration was replaced by Blair. A Broadway production in 2000 coincided with the disputed Bush-Gore election. And now, confirming the work's record as history's running-mate, its latest London staging coincides with another Westminster crisis.</p> <p>There are sure to be knowing laughs from the audience at the aphorism that, if a leader has to assert his authority, it is already too late; and at the prime minister's complaint that he has been forced to tolerate a particular chancellor, because \"I have no one else.\" \"It's extraordinary,\" agrees Sam West, who directs. \"The actors were doing workshops in schools this morning, and they constructed half a dozen mock tabloid headlines about things that happen in the play. And they showed them to the children and said, 'When does this play take place?' and they said, 'Well, now.'\"</p> <p>Until recently, Waste suffered from being judged ahead of its time. The 1907 script was banned - because it showed doctors conniving in illegal abortions - with the result that Waste was not premiered until 1936, in a rewritten version. West has combined these two texts, mainly to clarify some exchanges involving arcane arrangements to disestablish the Church of England. To modern ears, Waste most resembles a lost Edwardian edition of The West Wing, a series that showed that even opaque political detail can be gripping. \"Yes. That's what we're finding,\" West says. \"It's fascinating when people use code on stage. There's an exchange in act two where they're talking about 'pre-restoration endowments' and the 'figures being very troubling'. And it doesn't matter whether we know what they're talking about, because they clearly know.\"</p> <p>West was once on the far left of theatre, a member of the Socialist Workers Party, and he accepts that his younger self would have bridled at Granville-Barker's underlying respect for the parliamentary system. \"Oh yeah, I'd have thought Guy Fawkes was right.\" His politics have softened - with almost BBC balance, he brought in both Tony Benn and Martin Bell to address his cast - though he says that the banking crisis has made him \"more of a revolutionary than last week\".</p> <p>Halfway through the sentence, West's voice cracks and he pauses to gargle. For an actor, such a thoracic crackle late in rehearsals would be a major crisis; but the luxury of West's double life is that despite an impressive theatrical and screen CV - including Hamlet and Richard II for the RSC, and Cambridge Spies on television - he is not an actor on the day we speak. He says that the balance is currently \"about 60/40\" in favour of acting, and he expects the gap to compress further.</p> <p>Is his sore throat a consequence of shouting at his cast? He smiles: \"I'm coming to realise that you can't direct a play so that they say the lines the way you want. You can't even direct it the way you want it to be done. Sometimes it will be less than you want, and sometimes more. And it's leaving open the 'more than you want' that's important.\" Sometimes he will know instinctively how he might speak a line, but knows he must not offer this model to another actor. \"It's about allowing people to be as good as they can. Everyone, rightly, is talking about Michael Grandage's production of Ivanov. What was remarkable to me about it was that you had no sense of a controlling directorial hand, and yet every actor on stage was playing out of their skin. That's the ideal.\" His only obsession as a director, he says, is that only one word in every sentence should be stressed: some actors fall into newsreaderish over-emphases. </p> <p>One of the issues facing West with regard to Waste is whether his actors should speak as if they are sucking plums. Most British period pieces are now democratised several notches, in case the dialogue starts to sound like an Armstrong and Miller send-up. \"It's a problem,\" West says. \"When first performed, it would have been hugely posh. Helen Lindsay, who plays Lady Mortimer, was saying 'orff' for 'off' in rehearsal. And I thought: well, she would have done, but I'm not going to have it. When I played Anthony Blunt in Cambridge Spies, I didn't say 'orff', although he did, because I think it becomes distracting now. What matters is clarity and diction. It will be well-spoken, but it must not sound affected.\"</p> <p>Like his friend and mentor George Bernard Shaw, Granville-Barker favoured long, novelistic stage directions. For example: \"If Horsham were an old woman - and opponents have been known to call him so - he might, one fears, be accounted a cat. But really this is an exceptional outburst ... a little snappishness is a safety valve.\" In some recent productions of Shaw, actors have asked for a dialogue-only script, fearful of being straitjacketed by the writer's intentions. Does West advise his cast to ignore Harley-Barker's demands? \"No, not at all. Granville-Barker was also an actor and 'a little snappishness is a safety-valve' is actually an incredibly useful note. His stage directions are actable.\"</p> <p>But what about the minor character of whom we are told: \"In his spare moments - he has few - he walks disinterestedly in the more removed paths of literature\"? How do you act that? \"Well, all right, you can't act that precisely. But the point is that he gives actors something to work with, even in minor roles. Famously, he told an actress that she must convey in the way she entered the room that she spent a lot of spare time visiting clergy. And her only line was 'How do you do?'\"</p> <p>Part of West's fascination with Granville-Barker is that he, too, was an actor-manager, who wrote Waste to launch a season at the Savoy Theatre. West recently spent two years as producer-performer at the Sheffield Crucible. He planned to stage another Granville-Barker classic - The Voysey Inheritance - during his third season there, but resigned after a disagreement with the board. West insists that there is nothing for conspiracy theorists in his departure: the theatre was closed for a lengthy refurbishment and West couldn't secure funding for his proposal of an itinerant company at temporary venues in Sheffield: \"You can't be an artistic director if there's no art to direct. It was amicable, but it was a disagreement.\"</p> <p>He would like to run another theatre, but worries about the domestic effect of the long hours and tight pay. He lives with the playwright Laura Wade and says, \"I would also like to have a family; the difficulty is that the theatre can become your baby, and I'm 42 now.\"</p> <p>As the son of the actors Prunella Scales and Timothy West, his entry to the profession might seem inevitable. But he resisted for a long time, choosing science A-levels and avoiding school plays (although he was leaned on at the age of eight to play a son to his father's Edward VII on television). He remembers the schoolyard kudos of his mother being in Fawlty Towers. \"She said that working with John Cleese was like being in a room with a loaded machine-gun and making sure it didn't point at you.\" He offered his father a part in Waste but a holiday clashed. \"I asked him if he could move the dates of the cruise, but he said no.\" He would like to direct his parents one day, but can't imagine calling them Tim and Pru, rather than Ma and Da, in rehearsal.</p> <p>West still impresses as an actor: he was chilling as the cuckolded but controlling husband in a recent Donmar revival of Pinter's Betrayal. He was also a powerful Edward Heath in the BBC's young Thatcher biopic, The Road to Finchley, where the script had Heath fancying Maggie. Surely even Granville-Barker couldn't write the stage direction to help a man play that?</p> <p>\"I think what I played is that he was in love with what she represented: a brilliant grammar school student and a thorn in the side of the establishment.\" Was he playing a gay man or a straight man? \"I suppose I was playing someone who had never had sex, with a man or a woman. But I started from the outside: why do his shoulders shake when he laughs, why does he never move sideways? Heath was incredibly held-in.\"</p> <p>Having become a director, is it harder to take direction from others? \"For me, it was a relief. You think, 'Fuck, this is a difficult scene-change coming up.' But then you realise you can go, 'Bye, then, I'm off to learn my lines'\".</p> <p><strong>Waste </strong>previews at the Almeida Theatre, London N1, this week. Box office: 020 7359 4404</p>",
  "<p>With concerns about gang, gun and knife crime currently to the fore, it is little wonder to find a new production of Romeo and Juliet highlighting this theme in battles between the Montagues and Capulets. Given that the director is Michael Bogdanov, with his track record of audacious stagings of Shakespeare, it is even less of a surprise. Bogdanov reprises the radically updated final scene he gave his 1974 production, played as a brash press conference, in this new version.</p> <p>Yet, like much else here, it falls flat. In 1974, Bogdanov had Jonathan Kent as Romeo; here he has Jack Ryder, best known as Jamie Mitchell in EastEnders. Ryder struggles to carry the role, delivering the lines without rhythm or vigour, and hoping to inhabit the part by standing still and raising his arms sideways a lot. There is not even the merest tingle of passion conveyed between him and Sara Lloyd-Gregory's Juliet, though she is more affecting in her soliloquies.</p> <p>The production feels amateurish and self-indulgent, especially in the hackneyed use of music, with the Prodigy's Firestarter for a fight scene and, this being Wales, the requisite dollop of Manic Street Preachers. It is not the modernising gestures that irk here, though, but the lack of coherence, together with moments that come perilously close to farce. Why does the nurse ride about on a bike with baguettes in the basket? Why does Juliet wave a gun at Friar Laurence? Why the press conference ending? These details might melt away if we could believe in our star-cross'd lovers and their world. Sadly, we never really do.</p>",
  "<p>Is Mrs Margaret Thatcher running for President? Scarcely a day has passed this week on which she has not paraded her intense personal involvement in the direction of departmental policies. On Sunday the papers bulged with steers that she has grabbed Mr Kenneth Baker's education bill by the collar. \"Mrs Thatcher has intervened to take personal control of the Government's radical educational reforms,\" said one. On Monday she summoned the heads of British broadcasting to Downing Street for a three-hour seminar on deregulation of the airwaves. Came Tuesday and there she was again, touring Handsworth and Wolverhampton as she had toured Teesside and Glasgow, setting out the stall for the inner cities regeneration drive on which she is intent on making the pace. Thatcherism has never been more personalised. Is this all a little much, ma'am?</p> <p>On one level, such high profile leadership is not new. Over the years, there have been other Downing Street seminars - on drugs, Aids, crime and football hooliganism - seeking to forge (appropriate word) decisive answers to seemingly intractable problems. And there have been the endless other glorifications of the Prime Minister's unique leadership skills over matters ranging from milk quotas to nuclear weapons. But the tempo of her interventions was never as rapid as it is today.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher's concept of leadership has always been Churchillian (or what she likes to imagine as Churchillian) rather than, say, Attlee-esque. Yet for her, leading from the front is more than a matter of style. She believes - not without justice - that she has some special ability to understand the deeper instincts of the white, lower middle-class English upon whom her power is based. In her own eyes, as perhaps in theirs, she is the guarantor that their demands will not be deflected either by the old Tory ruling-class or by the corporatist wiles of the civil service. But this self-image has led her into trouble as well as to triumph.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago, Mr John Biffen warned that to win the election the Conservatives would need a \"balanced ticket.\" Though his remarks caused outrage in Downing Street, last autumn's Tory Conference was carefully prepared as a team effort. It was a great success, providing the springboard for the Conservatives' opinion poll recovery and election triumph. Yet Mrs Thatcher seems to have forgotten that lesson. Perhaps she is blinded by the third victory. Perhaps she really does believe that anything is now possible and that only she can make it happen. If so, it is a dangerous vanity. Nobody voted, three months ago, for Snow White and the twenty dwarfs.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday September 26 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below we said that Britain's ranking in a league table compiled by an anti-corruption group fell this year and that Ireland performed better than Britain. In fact the UK and Ireland share 16th place on Transparency International's 2008 Corruption Perceptions Index.</p> <p> </p> <p>People around the world believe that Britain has become a markedly more corrupt country, according to a league table published yesterday.</p> <p>Britain has slipped down the rankings of a table compiled yearly by the group Transparency International, following political scandals and the government's failure to prosecute over alleged bribery.</p> <p>The table is compiled each year by the global anti-corruption group, from polls taken around the world. The results are used to assess how much corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians in 180 countries.</p> <p>Britain is now classed as the 16th cleanest country in the world, down from 12th in the previous year, and its worst performance since the league table was started in 1995. The survey shows that Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden are jointly perceived to be the least corrupt countries. Other countries performing better than Britain include Ireland, Germany and Norway. Somalia sits at the bottom of the table as the most corrupt, closely followed by Burma and Iraq. The executive director of Transparency International, Chandrashekhar Krishan, said it was \"probably no surprise\" that Britain's reputation had \"significantly worsened\". He said: \"Public confidence in political office has been eroded by the 'cash-for-honours' affair and the grudging exposures of MPs' expenses.\"</p> <p>Britain, he added, had a \"wretched and woeful record\" in prosecuting business executives for paying bribes to foreign politicians and officials to win contracts. </p> <p>He said this was epitomised by the government's decision to drop the police investigation into allegations that BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, paid bribes to Saudi royals. </p> <p>Britain's anti-bribery law has been criticised for being weak and antiquated. The Law Commission is due to publish fresh proposals in November and the business secretary, John Hutton, is promising a parliamentary bill to reform the legislation.</p> <p>Britain's only foreign bribery conviction since it signed a global anti-corruption treaty in 1997 was secured this week when Ananais Tumukunde, an adviser to the Ugandan president, was jailed for a year for receiving bribes from a British company director. But he was convicted under an old anti-corruption act dating from 1906, rather than a newer act passed seven years ago. </p> <p>Britain's record on foreign bribery will come under renewed scrutiny in October when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which enforces the 1997 convention, reports the outcome of its investigation into the UK's compliance with the treaty.</p> <p>The Department for Business defended the government's performance, saying: \"In many areas we go further than the requirements of the OECD anti-bribery convention.\" The spokesman added that there was an \"increasing number of UK investigations into foreign bribery, with 20 live cases and almost 50 preliminary enquiries ongoing\".</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <p><strong>Least corrupt countries</strong></p> <p>1= Denmark</p> <p>1= New Zealand </p> <p>1= Sweden</p> <p>4 Singapore</p> <p>5= Finland</p> <p>5= Switzerland</p> <p><strong>Most corrupt countries </strong></p> <p>180 Somalia</p> <p>178= Burma</p> <p>178= Iraq</p> <p>177 Haiti</p> <p>176 Afghanistan</p>",
  "<p>You can't choose your relatives but you can choose which ones you write about. Deciding on whose lives you will research - whether as part of a family history or as a single biography - will depend on several factors. Ideally, your interests and skills should match theirs. If you want to write about a Nobel Prize winning economist but you failed maths GCSE you may struggle to appreciate their work. On the other hand, ignorance can be the ideal starting point from which to demystify a complicated subject. </p> <p>Weigh up the type and availability of sources before choosing your subject. There should be enough material to allow you to get to know the person you're researching but not so much that it would take you your lifetime to read it. When Michael Holroyd was researching the life of George Bernard Shaw he began to think that Shaw, who wrote 10 letters every day of his adult life and had the benefit of shorthand and secretaries, could write more in a day than Holroyd could read. By contrast, if you're interested in an early professional footballer you may discover that he didn't write a single letter and you will have to find other ways of giving him a \"voice\" - perhaps by quoting from newspaper interviews or speaking to someone who knew him.</p> <p>Much research can be carried out on the internet but you will still have to interview people, consult collections and probably make at least one trip to somewhere such as the National Archives (formerly the Public Record Office) in Kew or the Imperial War Museum in south London. How far you live from your main sources will affect the time and expense involved. If they are abroad both will rise and you may also face language difficulties. </p> <p><strong>Copyright</strong></p> <p>If you intend to quote extensively from a particular source don't wait until the last minute to see whether you will be granted permission. You may be refused or the price might be prohibitively high - in which case you will have to rewrite the book. The use of song lyrics, even if you want to use just one line, can be particularly expensive.</p> <p>You can't quote a \"substantial\" part of a copyright work without permission but what constitutes \"substantial\" is open to debate. Four lines from a short poem might be \"substantial\", whereas several sentences from a novel would not be. </p> <p>Letters belong to the recipient but the writer holds the copyright which is passed to their estate after their death. When travel writer Paul Theroux wrote a memoir about his one time friend, Nobel Laureate VS Naipaul he was only allowed to quote tiny amounts from Naipaul's letters to him and was not allowed to see his replies. He was, in effect, denied access to his own letters.</p> <p>Whether a work is still in copyright depends on factors such as when the author died and their nationality. Most archives should be able to advise you on how to ask for permission to use material they hold or you can write to the publisher of a writer you want to quote. The Society of Authors publishes two useful guides: Copyright and Moral Rights and Permissions.</p> <p><strong>What's out there already?</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Consult the <a href=\"http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-list\"> British Library catalogue</a> to see if any books have already been written about the person or topic you're interested in; check when they were written and who published them. If they appeared a long time ago or were published by a specialist press you have a greater chance of interesting a publisher in a new account. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do an online search for the name of the person you're interested in and make a note of sources to follow up, for example, archives, academic publications or appreciation societies.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check an online bookseller such as <a href=\"http://www.Amazon.com\">Amazon.com</a> to see if any books about your subject are due to be published. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you want reassurance that no one else is working on the same subject contact the main sources or experts - for example, family members, copyright holders of material such as letters or diaries, or archivists - who may know. However, this is not foolproof and carries the risk of alerting a biographer in search of a subject. </p> <p><strong>Is my idea commercial?</strong></p> <p>If you want to get published consider how commercial your idea is before you devote the next few years of your life to it. Your grandchildren will probably enjoy reading your account of how their great-aunts and uncles survived in the poverty of 1930s Ireland because of their personal connection to the people you're describing. But the book is likely to be too similar to Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning, Angela's Ashes to interest a publisher. </p> <p>Likewise, finding a publisher for a biography of a well-known person is very difficult unless you have something new to say. Most publishers would be reluctant to commission a new biography of someone like Winston Churchill. However, if your father was Churchill's driver and kept a diary of his working life they might be interested in an account told from the chauffeur's perspective. Alison Light took a startlingly fresh approach to the Bloomsbury Set - a group which had been written about exhaustively and exhaustingly - in her book, Mrs Woolf &amp; the Servants, The Hidden Heart of Domestic Service. </p> <p>Conversely, \"sales and marketing\" (who have a huge say in whether a publisher commissions a book) are likely to be wary of a subject that no one has heard of. However, there are plenty of examples of individuals dragged out of obscurity to delight modern readers. Kate Summerscale became fascinated by Joe Carstairs when she wrote her obituary for the Daily Telegraph. When she started work on her biography very few people had heard of Carstairs, an oil heiress who dressed like a man, held records for speedboat racing in the 1920s, owned her own island and poured her affection into a rag doll. Summerscale told her story in such a compelling way that The Queen of Whale Cay became a bestseller. </p> <p>Sometimes the quality of the writing is enough to secure publication. On paper Bad Blood by Lorna Sage, a memoir written by an academic about growing up in the 1940s in a bleak vicarage on the English/Welsh borders, may not sound compelling but it won the Whitbread Biography of the Year in 2001 and was praised for its lyrical writing and dark humour. </p> <h2>Exercise: blurb</h2> <p>The blurb is the writing on the back of a book which tells the potential reader what the book is about and encourages them to buy it. Write a blurb about the book you intend to write. This exercise will help you to spot the highlights of your story and any themes that you might want to explore.</p>",
  "<p>Leading universities are to launch intensive American-style recruitment campaigns to talent-spot the brightest pupils in low-performing local schools, the universities secretary John Denham will announce today.</p> <p>He will court controversy by suggesting that these universities should offer pupils from schools with a poor record of university entrance a place on condition of lower A-level results than applicants from high performing schools.</p> <p>The plan, to be announced in his speech to the Labour party conference today, will prove deeply unpopular among independent schools, who say their pupils will be disadvantaged, and among some leading universities, which have accused the government of pressuring them to \"dumb down\" their entrance requirements.</p> <p>Nine universities have signed up to the scheme and will identify schools that have not traditionally sent many pupils to university. As in America, universities will spend time selecting pupils for open days and interviews. The universities are Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, King's College London, Leeds, Leicester, Newcastle, Southampton and Warwick.</p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge are currently not signed up to the programme, which was described as \"embryonic\" yesterday, but the minister is hoping to expand it rapidly after its introduction in 2010.</p> <p>Crucially, pupils identified through the scheme will be able to apply to any of the universities taking part, to prevent them being limited to their local area. They will still have to pass interviews and get the required grades - even if those grades are lower than the usual offer.</p> <p>An aide to Denham said the scheme would involve making \"grade offers which are reasonable given the schools' background\". Asked if that meant lower offers to pupils from schools that do not usually send pupils to interview at top universities, she replied: \"That's the gist of it.\"</p> <p>Denham said: \"I have always been clear that we must allow the most talented and hard working of our young people to achieve their full potential, irrespective of what kind of social background they came from, or the school they went to.</p> <p>\"This does not mean imposing admissions policies on universities. But it does mean universities recognising their full responsibilities in helping to seek out and develop the best of talents.\"</p> <p>Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of research intensive universities, said they already work hard with local schools to inspire pupils to apply to university and they are launching courses for teachers on how to help pupils apply.</p> <p>\"We are more than happy to discuss a range of options - including ideas outlined in John Denham's speech - with [the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills] and other key stakeholders to minimise further the barriers that face some students. However, Russell Group universities are careful to ensure that the details and logistics of any new scheme are thoroughly thought through before they are agreed to and implemented,\" she said.</p> <p>Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University and chair of Million+ which represents new universities, said: \"It sounds like exactly the work we have been doing for years.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents 250 fee-charging schools, said: \"What independent schools have always campaigned for is university admissions policies that are fair, transparent and based on published criteria.</p> <p>\"If overwhelmed universities take refuge in specious mathematical formulae, then unfair discrimination will be the result.\"</p>",
  "<p>Students in debt were thrown a lifeline yesterday when the main financial watchdog said an army of money advisers will be sent to higher education colleges to help them get a grip on their finances.</p> <p>The Financial Services Authority said in light of the credit crunch it wanted to educate students manage their debts and prevent them getting into difficulties. </p> <p>According to figures from the FSA one in three students are constantly overdrawn. One in three never check their bank balance while a marginally smaller proportion admit to being \"completely disorganised\" about their money. While the number of students who ignore their personal finances is probably representative of the wider population, a growing number of students are in debt to banks. </p> <p>The average student debt according to Barclays is about \u00a316,000. Debt campaigners have predicted that by 2010 students will have average debts of more than \u00a330,000. Rent rises and the soaring cost of heating and food have pushed many students into financial difficulties.</p> <p>Chris Pond, FSA director of financial capability, said rises in interest rates on loans and credit cards had proved especially costly for students who relied on debt to fund their studies.</p> <p>Pond said: \"The FSA's Money Doctors programme is a new approach to financial education and seeks to address some of the causes of student financial problems. Our research shows that young people are least able to manage their finances and this is why much of our work targets this group.\" </p> <p>The FSA has already advised 90,000 students at a range of colleges. The FSA aims to train 100 money advisers to talk to students at 50 colleges. By 2010 it hopes to have a network of advisers at all 168 higher education colleges in Britain.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Getting started</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Basics. Gather together as many official documents as you can. These might include death, marriage and birth certificates; census returns; wills; divorce records and details of service in the armed forces. The Family Records Centre in London, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' family history centres and many county record offices and larger public libraries (which often have family or local history specialists) are all good places from which to start your search. Although official documents aren't infallible they will provide you with key dates on which to build. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Draw up a family tree. Include as much basic information as you can: first names, dates of births, deaths and marriages, professions and causes of death. Pin it up where you can study it and add question marks if you're unsure of information. As your knowledge grows so will the family tree and you will have a clearer idea of the point at which to begin your biography or family history. Trends and questions will also emerge. If you're writing a biography of a music hall star and several of her relatives married jockeys perhaps you need to explore the connections between the two ways of earning a living? Or maybe several members of your family died from a similar disease - was this hereditary or caused by a life working down the mines? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Start a timeline. Include dates from the family tree and expand it so that it covers the period you will be writing about. Compile it on a computer so you can easily add new events as your research progresses; include both minor dates such as when they started university or school as well as bigger events - for example, when they were arrested for chaining themselves to the railings in support of votes for women. If you're researching a particularly dramatic moment - perhaps when the Titanic sank with your grandfather on board - you may want to add hour-by-hour details.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Know your competition. Read similar books so that you can tell a publisher why your biography will be different. Pay particular attention to the footnotes and \"notes on sources\". Photocopy the bibliography and work your way through it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Contact family members. If your subject has any surviving family members you are going to have to be very, very nice to them. They may be able to provide valuable information and you will probably need their approval to quote from letters or diaries or to reproduce photos. They, however, may be suspicious of someone nosing around their family. Write them a reassuring letter and ask if you can visit them. Timing is crucial: you should have learnt enough about the subject to make the meeting worthwhile, but don't leave it too long to interview someone in their 90s. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Befriend an expert. No matter what your subject, the chances are someone will already have studied it - perhaps for years. This needn't be bad news. Many archivists and local or specialist historians are keen to share their enthusiasm and will provide valuable \"leads\" - who to interview and which archives to use. Special interest groups such as Researching Far East Prisoners of War (<a href=\"http://www.researchingfepowhistory.org.uk/\">researchingfepowhistory.org.uk/</a>) can also put you in touch with useful contacts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Start your own journal. Research is as much - if not more - fun than writing a biography or family history and you might decide to weave a sense of this drama into your book. How did it feel to lay a wreath on your grandfather's grave at Passchendaele or to meet the last descendant of the famous woman whose life you want to write? You can also use the journal to speculate, or to remind yourself to follow up leads: \"Was Maud having an affair with Thomas?\", \"Why did Gosia leave Poland?\", \"Visit Jewish Museum\". </p> <p><strong>On the coalface </strong></p> <p>Despite the importance of the internet there is still nothing quite like the thrill of consulting an original document. Primary sources offer vital clues to how someone was feeling when they wrote their diary or letter. The crossings out, jottings in the margins, the pressure of their pen or pencil on the paper, the red rose preserved between the pages of a journal have all disappeared in an electronic age. </p> <p>Before you visit an archive try to establish in advance exactly what material it contains. Many have leaflets to help you navigate your way around their collection - for example the National Archives has research guides on subjects ranging from \"hedgerows\" to \"Ireland: the Easter Rising 1916\". Don't just turn up at the library or collection in case it is closed for its annual stock take, or you need an appointment. </p> <p>Ensure that your notes will be legible in a few years' time and that you know where to find a certain fact. This is particularly important if you decide to include footnotes. Record each piece of information and where it came from. You can buy a software package but a card index system works just as well. Remember to cross-reference topics. If you're writing about the first person to open a curry house in Britain you might have a card index on \"curry house menu\" cross-referenced to \"general diet - Britain\" to allow you to compare the dishes served in the restaurant with what most Britons were eating. </p> <p>Source materials don't have to be dusty sheets of yellowing paper; people leave behind traces of themselves in a whole range of media. Old cine film will give you an idea how someone moved and how they related to other people. Many researchers find that they only really connect with their subject when they hear them speak - albeit against the hiss of an early sound recording - or catch a glimpse of them moving. The British Sound Archive has a wide selection of famous and not so famous voices.</p> <p>Most biographers make pilgrimages to places that were significant to their subject. Antonia Fraser describes this as \"optical research\" and says it as valuable as hours spent in archives. While she was researching both Charles II and the gunpowder plot she crammed herself into hidey holes constructed for forbidden Catholic priests so that she could experience something of what they went through. </p> <p>Bear in mind that a place may have changed dramatically. If your grandmother was a sales assistant in Peter Jones department store in London's Sloane Square don't assume that she worked in today's majestic glass-fronted shop. The modern frontage didn't appear until 1934 and your grandmother might have been used to the fussy Victorian building that preceded it.</p> <p><strong>Images </strong></p> <p>Photos can provide visual prompts for your story. Sebastian Junger uses a photo taken in 1963 of himself as a baby perched on his mother's lap with two workmen behind them as the starting point for his book, A Death in Belmont. One of the men is Albert DeSalvo who later confessed to being the Boston Strangler - but did his crimes include the brutal murder of Junger's neighbour, Bessie Goldberg? The author re-examines the evidence in a way that makes the book part whodunit and part social history.</p> <p>You can view thousands of images online at archives such as Hulton Getty, the Mary Evans Picture Library and the Imperial War Museum. Many collections, including the Science Museum and National Archives, include rare photos. The bigger agencies usually charge high fees for using their images and it's much cheaper if you can persuade family members or other people you interview to let you copy their photos. You are also more likely to find original images this way. </p> <p>Maps, diagrams, drawings, extracts from magazines or documents can be as visually arresting as photos. Guy Fawkes's two signatures - before and after torture - show more vividly than a description of his physical appearance how the ordeal affected him. The earlier signature is strong and firm, whereas the second is weak and tremulous.</p> <p><strong>Getting to know the period</strong></p> <p>Immersing yourself in a period will help you to understand the context to your subject's life, their achievement and the difficulties they faced. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Find a good biography of someone similar or of a prominent person of the day. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Buy a general history of the period or topic. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Read what your subject would have read. Study newspapers and magazines; look carefully at the adverts to see what people were eating and wearing. Read the popular novels and non-fiction of the period. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Watch the films they would have seen: scan the TV listings for old movies or rent them on DVD. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Listen to the music that was popular at the time. This will give you clues as to what people wore and how they moved (it would be difficult to Charleston in a crinoline). </p> <h2>Max Arthur on interviewing techniques</h2> <p>The basic rules of interview etiquette are dictated by common sense and courtesy. For example, it is important to be prompt. </p> <p>Make sure your interviewee has understood in advance that you will be recording the interview, and take plenty of time to chat before you launch into the recording. </p> <p>It's crucial to a good interview that your subject maintains confidence in you, and nothing diminishes that as quickly as a technical malfunction. Ensure that you have a high quality tape recorder or DAT machine, plenty of spare discs, a decent microphone and headphones, and check your equipment obsessively before you leave home. </p> <p>Once the recording starts, make sure you've done your homework and can chat around the subject. Don't forget that you may well be the first person to whom they've told their story - a story that can sometimes be very painful for them to recall.</p> <p>If you need to prompt them, make sure you ask open, not closed questions. For instance: \"So, you were 18 when you went out to Spain?\" may simply garner the answer, \"Yes\". </p> <p>When interviewing people who are very old (the oldest I have interviewed was 110) you need to get in very close, and speak into whichever ear they feel is the stronger.</p> <p>Once you've finished the interview and transcribed it, send them a copy: ask if there is anything they would like deleted in retrospect and, indeed, anything they would like to add. From experience, most do. Always remember you are recording history.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Max Arthur's most recent book is Lest We Forget: Forgotten Voices </p> <h2>Kathryn Hughes on how to find your way through the archives</h2> <p>When visiting a new (to you) archive, it's essential to develop an attitude that is both open and focussed. You don't want to be so certain of what you've come to find that you block out an important discovery which comes at you from left field. Nor, though, do you want to waste ages sifting through material that has no relevance. I go in with a series of questions written down - Why was he named after his uncle? Why was she buried 400 miles from home? - and try methodically to find the answers.</p> <p>Since I'm both a fast touch-typist and physically chaotic, it makes sense to take all my notes on an ultra-portable laptop. But, whether you type or write, it's essential to make a clear record of which document you're using. Its description (or \"descriptor\" in archivese) - Letters from the Earl of Pembroke to his Son - is far less important than the anonymous designation, which will be something like PT/Pem: 2, 50 DQ. It may not trip off the tongue, but it means you can identify the material easily if you need to check a detail several years later.</p> <p>Do remember that the librarians and archivists who watch over this material are your best friends, so it pays to be nice to them. They'll be able to point you to the salient document within moments. Just don't expect them to take a personal interest in your research. I get embarrassed when I see punters boring on for Britain about their work to a librarian who is obviously itching to get on with her never-ending To Do list.</p> <p>As for all those dreary rules about only using pencil and leaving your handbag in the cloakroom - sometimes I wonder why they don't insist on nude note-taking, just to ensure that you're not trying to smuggle out documents in your pants. . </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Kathryn Hughes' latest book is The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton </p> <h2>Exercise: names</h2> <p>Write 500 words about your first name. Why did your parents choose it; is it a name that's been in your family for generations; were you named after anyone? Do you have any nicknames and do different people call you by different names - if so, how does each variation make you feel?</p> <h2>Exercise: taste, smell and sound</h2> <p>Answer the following questions in relation to your subject and the period in which they lived:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What did it taste like? Tiffin or tandoori chicken?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What did it smell like? The frangipani of Singapore or the burnt sugar of York?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What did it sound like? Street vendors of Jaipur or organ grinders of Whitechapel?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What did your subject read? Penny dreadfuls or Married Love by Marie Stopes?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> What did they wear? A flapper's dress or a twinset and pearls?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> How did they relax on a Saturday night? Embroidery or rolling back the carpet to dance to ragtime?</p> <h2>Exercise: timeline</h2> <p>Draw up a timeline of the major events of the period you're writing about and put it in a file side by side with the timeline for the key happenings in your subject's life (see above). Include in this second timeline events in the wider world - this might be the publication of Lady Chatterley's Lover, the Beatles performing their first gig, the election of a new prime minister.</p>",
  "<p>Michael, 59, has been sleeping in the same office doorway in Fleet Street, in the City of London, for more than two years. He beds down on two pieces of cardboard, and is gone with his bedding and belongings before workers arrive in the morning. \"It's safe and clean, and I usually get a good night's sleep\", he says. </p> <p>Last week, Michael was repeatedly woken at 2.30am by the police, accompanied by council street cleaners. \"Two policemen asked my name and date of birth and did a check on me, then instructed me to pack up my things and move on,\" he says. \"When I'd done that, the road sweeping operators poured lots of water where I'd been sleeping.\" </p> <p>This controversial practice of \"wetting down\" was introduced in the Square Mile in April by the City of London Corporation, in partnership with the police and homelessness charity Broadway. But following protests by a local church group and housing campaigners, Operation Poncho was temporarily suspended in July pending an evaluation of its impact.</p> <p>The Rev Simon Perry, of Bloomsbury Central Baptist Church, says he was \"very disappointed\" to learn that wetting down had resumed without any consultation and ahead of a meeting in October to discuss the way forward. \"It's sub-human, waking people up to force them to accept your help,\" he insists. \"You can't go up to someone who is smoking, pull a cigarette out of their mouth and tell them it's for their own good.\"</p> <p>Howard Sinclair, chief executive of Broadway, says: \"The whole point is to make it uncomfortable for people to sleep on the streets, to make them confront the fact that it is not doing them any good, and to engage with services.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337901172\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/1rough.jpg\" alt=\"Camera phone pictures show rough sleepers bedding down for the night\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rough sleepers bed down for the night. Photograph: Bloomsbury Baptist Church</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomsbury Baptist Church</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Broadway is contracted by the City of London Corporation to send outreach workers ahead of the hosing to try to get rough sleepers into hostels, or drug or alcohol services. Sinclair says , as a result of Operation Poncho, 99 people were helped to get off the streets between April and August, compared with 46 during the same period a year ago. \"Some have gone into temporary accommodation, some have returned to their home countries, others have been put into detoxification or rehabilitation programmes,\" he says.</p> <p>But critics of wetting down say it takes no account of east Europeans, who are not eligible for state-funded help. \"It takes trust and long-term befriending to encourage people alienated from society to take up appropriate offers of help,\" says Alistair Murray, regions coordinator at Housing Justice. \"This is a barbaric way to address the issue and will be counter-productive by driving people further away from services.\" </p> <p>The City of London is not the first area to drench rough sleepers' bedding spots. In Westminster, the council denies the practice - which it calls \"hot washing\" - is intended to remove rough sleepers from the streets. But a study published last year by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that \"hot washing\" was employed as a measure to deal with problematic street culture.</p> <p>Sarah Johnsen, co-author of the report, The Impact of Enforcement on Street Users in England, says hot washing on its own failed to tackle the problem. \"All it did was disperse rough sleepers and this can distance vulnerable people from services,\" she says. The report concludes enforcement tools can motivate some rough sleepers but only if \"carefully integrated with individually tailored and immediately accessible supportive interventions\".</p> <p>Councils are under pressure to meet government targets to have zero people sleeping rough by 2012, and police forces are also under pressure to get rough sleepers off the streets. Superintendent Lorraine Cussen, who oversees the Metropolitan Police's involvement in Operation Poncho, says: \"The whole focus of policing now is to respond to what communities want. Businesses and residents in the area are concerned that groups of rough sleepers who are drinking can become violent. The police's role is to facilitate the corporation to clean the street, and for officers to make contact with rough sleepers who need to access services.\" </p> <p>Cussen, who says that east Europeans are put in contact with an organisation that could help them return home, confirmed wetting down had resumed at two hot spots, without consulting critics, following a significant rise in numbers in August after the practice was halted.</p> <p><strong>Entrenched</strong></p> <p>\"Broadway outreach workers targeted groups of entrenched rough sleepers for the two weeks of September,\" Cussen says. \"Then, last week, the cleaning department and police went out to clean two specific areas, where rough sleepers are known to congregate. Operation Poncho partners agreed to stop the total 'washdown' of the City, but not to stop targeting specific areas.\" She adds: \"We are keen to hear about alternative solutions. We have to take some action.\" </p> <p>Sinclair says, in the months ahead, Broadway will work with the police and corporation \"to make sure rough sleepers do not simply disappear behind doorways, but are cared for and helped to start rebuilding their lives\".</p> <p>For Michael, this means many more disrupted nights' sleep. So will it force him into a hostel? \"No,\" he says. \"I just wait for them to leave and put my cardboard back on the floor and go back to sleep.\"</p>",
  "<p>The contents page of a biography or memoir will give you an idea of the structure the author has used. Chapters in biographies are usually around 6-8,000 words in length but there are no hard and fast rules. The occasional short chapter can bring variety to the pace of the book. Some authors punctuate their chapters with short asides in which they pause from the main narrative to expand a particular theme without interrupting the narrative flow. Kathryn Hughes's The Short Life &amp; Long Times of Mrs Beeton is laced with \"interludes\" in which she explores topics such as Mrs Beeton's awareness of the link between health and diet, and whether Mrs Beeton ruined British cooking. Each adds to the reader's knowledge of the period without causing the narrative drive to stall. Alternatively, you might prefer to weave themes into the central story. </p> <p><strong>Cradle to Grave </strong></p> <p>A biography typically starts with the subject's birth (it's surprising how many begin with a description of the weather) and continues in a roughly chronological order until their death. The advantage of this approach, which could equally apply to the history of a family, is that it is easy to follow. The downside is that it can appear plodding - especially if you're writing about someone who had an action-packed early life but whose later days were tame. One solution is to condense your treatment of the less exciting years but this can be difficult to achieve without making the book seem unbalanced. Alexander Masters turned the traditional form on its head in Stuart, A Life Backwards by telling the story in reverse chronological order.</p> <p><strong>A year in the life of ... </strong></p> <p>Another approach is to focus on a distinct period, as James Shapiro does in 1599, A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare. This was the year in which the playwright completed Henry V, wrote Julius Caesar and As You Like It and drafted Hamlet, but also a year of great excitement in England - an aging Queen faced the threat of invasion by Catholic Spain, rebellion in Ireland and intrigue at court. Shapiro's book marries both threads together to create an intimate picture of what life must have been like for Shakespeare and the influences that fed into his writing. Shapiro starts with the winter of 1598 and refers to events before and after 1599 to illuminate a single year.</p> <p>This could work equally well for family history. The year 1948, for example, is significant for many families as it marked the arrival of West Indian immigrants on the ship Empire Windrush. Andrea Levy, herself the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, focussed on this one momentous year in her novel, Small Island.</p> <p>Richard Benson, a journalist with The Face, based his book, The Farm, on notebooks he kept during the few weeks when he helped his parents to prepare the family farm in Yorkshire for sale after they reluctantly decided they could no longer afford to live there. Although the book focuses on a distinct period in time, he widens its scope to reflect back on his childhood, and the importance of the farm in his life. </p> <p><strong>Group biographies and biographical pairings</strong></p> <p>Writing about two or more people whose lives have a natural symbiosis can give the reader more for less. The subjects might share a similar background and context and the interaction between them will give the reader a deeper understanding of each. </p> <p>This is especially true of family members and in particular siblings. James Fox's The Langhorne Sisters is both a group biography and a family history in which he uses letters and diaries to examine the lives of his great-aunts and grandmother who were born in Virginia, USA, but who made their mark on high society on both sides of the Atlantic</p> <p>One of the advantages of group biographies is that there is usually at least one figure who is more flamboyant than the others. He or she can sweep the story along, carrying other characters, who may be less compelling, with them. Nancy Astor, who became the first woman to take her seat in parliament, fills this role in The Langhorne Sisters. </p> <p>In some instances the rivalry and tension between the biographical subjects add a sense of drama to a joint biography whether the figures are Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes or the cousins Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots. Roland Huntford's joint biography of the polar explorers, Robert Scott and Roald Amundsen, The Last Place on Earth opens with a short description (less than a page) of the two men embarking on their expeditions before doubling back to outline earlier attempts to reach the South Pole and then jumping forward to look at Scott and Amundsen's biographical roots. His approach allows him to tell both their life stories at the same time as he recounts the race to the pole.</p> <p>Another way of pulling together the lives of a group of people is to use a single event as a unifying theme. In A Night at the Majestic, Richard Davenport-Hines describes a famous dinner party at the Majestic Hotel in Paris in 1922 that was attended by Stravinsky, Joyce, Diaghilev, Picasso and Proust. </p> <p><strong>Lucky dip</strong></p> <p>The structure of Nigel Slater's memoir, Toast, appears to be little more than a bundle of headings, mostly connected to food and each evoking a 1960s childhood: \"Spaghetti Bolognese\", \"Arctic Roll\", \"Butterscotch Flavour Angel Delight\" (which starts with a list of ingredients: \"Sugar, Modified Starch, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Emulsifiers ...)\" Each is no more than a few pages long. But, despite its apparent simplicity, the characters develop and the story unravels in a way that is far from haphazard. </p> <p>Since Slater is a professional cook, recipes provide natural prompts but this is a format that could translate to other subjects. If your parents met through their shared passion for amateur dramatics you could use theatre programmes to tell their story. Or if you have a box full of old photos you could write commentaries to some of the pictures. As you progress you will find that themes start to emerge: the annual camping trip when your mother stayed at home, the different houses you lived in, or family celebrations.</p> <p><strong>Chapter breakdown</strong></p> <p>Once you've decided on a structure you will need a chapter breakdown outlining what you will cover in each chapter. This is a valuable way of helping you to organise your material and to assess the overall pace of your book. Are there sections that appear a little \"flat\" and where you might want to freshen up your writing with extra research so that you can inject some colour into the writing? Or perhaps you need to move material around. Does one chapter contain too many facts or maybe you've revealed too much of the story too soon? Expect your chapter breakdown to change and evolve as your book takes shape. A publisher or literary agent will want to see it, together with at least one sample chapter, as part of your book proposal.</p> <p>A preface allows you to introduce your book and to tell the reader its scope and why you've decided to write it. This can be useful if you want to explain to younger generations why you've chosen to write a family history. A prologue gives you the chance to write an introductory scene - perhaps from a dramatic moment in the life you're about to write. The aim is to \"hook\" the reader but the danger in including a preface or prologue - or both - is that the reader doesn't quite know when the book proper has started. </p> <h2>Alexander Masters on structure</h2> <p>I'm rotten at planning books. Certainly I was with my first book, and I don't seem to have improved with the one I'm working on now. I write in blobs a possible chapter here, a couple of paragraphs there - and pray that sooner or later it'll all fit together. </p> <p>With Stuart, I messed up royally on the first attempt. I used the old-fashioned, orderly biographical structure: begin before the beginning, dole out 20 pages of ancestors until the hero appears, meander on through school etc. Somewhere about page 50 the subject finally does something interesting. Stuart said the result was \"bollocks boring\", and he was right. It bored me to tears. That type of structure reflected nothing of his character. Stuart was the opposite of orderly: a chaotic, outrageous, alcoholic sociopath who spent much of his adult life on the streets or in jail. </p> <p>Stuart discovered the solution. Tear up the first version and write the book the other way round, ie backwards, \"like a murder mystery\": start from the point when we first met, then work back to his childhood to find out \"what murdered the boy I was\". Not only did this structure offer a strong drive to the story, the telling of it became unpredictable and erratic again, and exciting to write. All that plodding preparation vanished. At last, the structure reflected the man. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alexander Masters' Stuart: A Life Backwards won the Whitbread Award for biography in 2005 </p> <h2>Exercise: foreground versus background</h2> <p>Decide who the principal characters will be and the background against which their story will be told. If you're writing the biography of a famous fashion designer the background might include rival designers, models, their partners and family. Their story might switch between the east end of London (where they grew up), to Carnaby Street (where they learnt their trade), to Paris (where they worked) to New York (where they lived when they were famous).</p>",

  "<p>The UK's main nuclear power generator is set to be bought today by French energy group EDF in a \u00a312.4bn deal that should kick-start government plans for a new generation of atomic plants.</p> <p>British Energy, saved from bankruptcy by the state in 2002, is being acquired by EDF primarily because the French want to win control of attractive sites on which to construct more nuclear plants.</p> <p>The deal would mean that the French company not only controls the bulk of the UK's current nuclear power stations but also will be responsible for implementing the government's plans to give the energy source a greater role.</p> <p>According to reports on ft.com, EDF has also signed a memorandum of understanding for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to take a 25% stake in British Energy. According to the website report, that deal is not likely to be signed for several months.</p> <p>The takeover of British Energy by EDF was set for completion in the summer but an 11th-hour revolt by key BE investors scuppered the public launch. EDF has sent out invitations for a press conference in Paris this morning and last night sources close to the industry said the loose ends had been tied up. </p> <p>Neither EDF nor British Energy would comment but industry sources said that Invesco and M&amp;G, which had rebelled against a 765p-a-share offer, now backed the deal.</p> <p>The offer has been raised to 774p but there is also an alternative of cash or a mixture of cash and contingent value rights (CVRs). These are used as a mechanism by which shareholders of an acquired company can receive additional benefits if a specified event occurs. In the case of British Energy, Invesco believes there will be more electricity price rises. </p> <p>The takeover will allow the UK government to claw back a multibillion pound windfall from its 36% stake in the firm following the bail-out which was necessitated after a period of plummeting electricity prices.</p> <p>According to some reports, EDF would pay \u00a33bn for the bulk - or entirety - of the government's holding.</p> <p>British Energy used to provide a quarter of the UK's electricity but increasingly frequent breakdowns of its ageing equipment had reduced that figure to less than 15%.</p> <p>The deal with EDF is expected to see the French company agree to hand over to government a number of sites that it could then auction off to rival companies such as E.ON and RWE, known to be keen to build their own atomic plants. </p> <p>BE runs eight UK nuclear sites with adjacent land on which reactors could be built.

  "<h2>Yes</h2> <p><strong>Ian Phillips</strong><br>Director of business affairs for F1 team Force India </p> <p>Ensuring formula one is a truly global sport by expanding into the Middle and Far East is a good thing. It is not so much a commercial decision - the benefits will not become apparent for a good many years, if ever, in terms of what it does for the sport. We have been going to Malaysia for 10 years and there's no discernible commercial gain out of going there; we have been going to China for four years yet you can't see that anything has dramatically changed in terms of revenue or the popularity of the sport there.</p> <p>We're going to a lot of places that don't have a culture of motor sport and it takes a minimum of five years for any event to establish itself. Only once that has happened can the sport begin to establish itself within that country, develop a fan base and grow from the bottom up. We have got to take a very, very long-term view on the move into these countries - it certainly will not bring immediate riches in terms of attracting new investment or sponsors. Maybe there will be a dribble, but that will scarcely be obvious.</p> <p>Admittedly, the sport as a whole certainly does benefit in that countries pay F1 to go there because it provides international exposure for the country and the city. Teams, of course, then benefit from the distribution of increased income for the commercial rights holders from television revenue.</p> <p>Globally, new circuits in the East give us a far wider spread which is good for the sport. Of course we don't want to lose the traditional heartland in Europe, the great circuits like Spa in Belgium or Monaco but we cannot perform for nothing in a sport that is vastly expensive to compete in.</p> <p>On today's business model then the direction the sport is moving in, <br>towards ensuring long-term growth and an increase in revenue, is the right one. We have got to go to countries who want to pay handsomely for us being there.</p> <p>Singapore this weekend is going to be fantastic because for the sport and the fans, street circuits are great. It's very expensive both to put on, and to watch, a track grand prix. When it's on a street circuit, you can get far more fans in around the streets, right up close to the action than you can when asking them to make a journey all the way to a track like they had to at Silverstone. And generally on street circuits racing is more exciting. Racing through the streets of a city has always been an exhilarating spectacle in formula one.</p> <p>Whether night racing will be a success is the big unknown. Our team manager went out there eight weeks ago and was shown track lighting five or 10 times more powerful than at a Premier League football stadium, so you would think it will be bright enough. It's going to be an interesting balance, though, between getting the track sufficiently lit for the drivers and making sure it doesn't distort the background. The unique setting of the skyscrapers and marina need to be visible. We don't want to lose the very reason we're going there.</p> <p>And the move to circuits around the world that are able to combine the very best facilities with breathtaking backdrops will continue. Glamorous locations are what formula one sells itself on. And I'm afraid tracks on former WWII aerodromes do not give the sport that glamorous image.</p> <h2>No</h2> <p><strong>Sir Jackie Stewart</strong><br>Three-time world champion and former BRDC president Formula one has been international from the beginning. The official world championship, the first ever grand prix, took place at Silverstone in 1950. There were four reasons that race took place: Britain, and, in no particular order, Italy, Germany and France. A vast amount of technology and participation in the sport has come out of these countries through the car companies involved. The industry that deals with the technology used and developed in formula one is still mainly based in Europe. Engineers come from all over the world to benefit from our expertise.</p> <p>New countries come and go on the calendar but the four founding members have always been there. There may be a new world in formula one that comprises Asia and the Pacific but you cannot forsake the foundations of the sport by suddenly taking grands prix away to countries who afford the enormous cost with government help.</p> <p>Staging a grand prix is now almost beyond a normal promoter because you cannot profit from the race. It is the governments of countries in Malaysia, China, Singapore and Australia who are supporting them. The French government is no longer subsidising their grand prix and there are fears it will disappear, which would be wrong. In this country, you can see how the government has supported sport by the number of medals won in Beijing - but the investment was colossal. In cricket, millions were invested a few years ago; motor sport has had zero. Maybe there's something wrong there because we have an industry that is producing considerable benefit to the economy. Britain is the capital of motor sport, employing around 50,000 people in the motor sports industry.</p> <p>Tradition does play a role in F1 and we have got to stand by it. You can't just walk away from the creators of the sport when those countries are still able to put on safe grands prix with great racing and a wide attendance. America did not host a grand prix this year, which is not right when you consider it is such a market-place for the world.</p> <p>Of course, the flip side of that is the commercial nature of the sport. There is more capital investment in formula one than any sport in the world. And we are talking about giant corporations here, not just the car companies. They are not just sponsoring the cars, but they are involved in circuit advertising and title sponsorship for these events. Financial services companies like RBS lead the way - they are one of the five biggest banks in the world - and then you have Santander, Credit Suisse and ING. All of them are global players who like the idea of going to places like Singapore to tap into a world audience. But there shouldn't be a situation where you can leave your roots; it is no good trying to build up a sport without its foundations.</p> <p>The night race is another attempt to put a different spin on the sport and move it forwards. There used to be a rule where you would have to have another race in a senior formula to prove that the organisation and the safety all worked well, but that no longer exists. I haven't seen the street circuit at Singapore but the success of any new track depends on the design. The race in Valencia on a street circuit didn't produce great close racing. But we had a fantastic race at Monaco on a circuit that is part and parcel of the sport's heritage.</p>",
  "<p>Stuart Gray knows all about losing bruising midfield jousts with Roy Keane but the Northampton manager exacted some measure of revenge for past batterings by forcing a penalty shoot-out last night. Keane may have got the better of Gray during their playing days but here Sunderland's manager saw a questionable rotation policy backfire and his Premier League team very nearly come badly undone.</p> <p>Sunderland - who, having used all three substitutes, were reduced to 10 men in extra-time after Nyron Nosworthy hobbled off - eventually stole through on penalties, their reserve keeper Marton Fulop saving the decisive final kick from Leon Constantine. But it was mighty close.</p> <p>\"I'm so proud,\" said Gray, whose side are floundering in League One but knocked out Bolton in the last round. \"We knocked the ball about and caused them problems.\" A glowering Keane, who seemed affronted that some home supporters had the temerity to boo him, blamed complacency. \"It was a bad, bad night,\" he said. \"One of the worst and longest I've had in my football career. A shambles. Everyone just thought we were going to win but we're not bloody Real Madrid, we need to work our socks off. But don't worry, I'll address it.\"</p> <p>Sunderland have a woeful cup record under Keane and they swiftly fell behind when Colin Larkin - deployed wide on the right of Gray's 4-5-1 formation - raced on to Constantine's flicked back-header and, having chested the ball down, half-volleyed it, right-footed, beyond Fulop.</p> <p>With Constantine receiving the ball direct from the keeper's long punt it was a real route-one strike but, far from being a kick-and-rush ensemble, Gray's men provided the night's better passes with Luke Guttridge outstanding.</p> <p>Sunderland's manager had revamped his team - there were eight changes from the side which started last Saturday's 2-0 win against Middlesbrough - and made two further half-time alterations when Michael Chopra and Kieran Richardson replaced the disappointing Carlos Edwards and David Healy.</p> <p>By now Keane - a manager so dedicated to rotation that his treasured pet dog Triggs has recently been forced to play second fiddle to a newly-acquired German Shepherd - may have started wondering whether giving Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and El-Hadji Diouf the night off was a good idea. Indeed Northampton looked fully in control when they doubled their lead in the 81st minute. Once again the excellent Larkin was involved, crossing for Guttridge to volley home.</p> <p>Anthony Stokes, another Sunderland substitute, is infamous for his sometimes less-than-reliable timekeeping - he was once dropped for missing the team coach - and he left it late to force extra-time by first stabbing home from close range after the keeper, Frank Fielding, collided with a defender and then, deep in stoppage time, heading in Andy Reid's corner.</p> <p>It proved insufficient to placate his manager. \"I'm not feeling relief,\" said Keane. \"I'm feeling anger, disappointment, frustration and a few other things. We got out of jail again - but we can't keep on doing it.\"</p>",
  "<p>If jailing bloggers has become the latest way repressive regimes cope with the blogosphere, Malaysia has taken this trend one step further this week. They served their highest-profile anti-government blogger, Raja Petra Raja Kamarudin, with a two-year detention order, removing him from the oversight of the courts. It is no small source of shame that the law they are using to detain him without charge is a legacy of British colonial rule against the communist insurgency. Raja Petra, who edits the Malaysia Today website, has had several brushes with the law. He was charged in May this year with sedition for alleging that a senior government minister was linked to the murder of a Mongolian model who was pestering him for money after he ended their affair. After his release on bail, he was detained again under the same draconian Internal Security Act on September 12 for \"insulting Islam\". Blogging from his cell, Raja reported that his special branch interrogators admitted they found that none of his articles had insulted Islam. They told him his style of writing was so sophisticated that his readers could possibly misinterpret what he was trying to say. To anyone outside the Malaysian government it is obvious who this blogger is: a well-informed critic of a corrupt regime. The renewable detention order is a way of putting him beyond the reach of the courts, where the specious actions against him can be exposed for what they are. As he says himself, \"heads they win, tails I lose\".</p>",

Montage: Michael Whittaker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a month in which<em> The Wire </em>has boldly rebranded itself with a cover shot of a bearded man stroking his chin, it might seem that there is not much more the British music press can do to surprise us. And <em>The Word</em>'s contention that Philip Norman's forthcoming John Lennon biography constitutes 'the most explosive rock story of the year' certainly seems to be stretching things a little. Not least because it's hard to believe <em>Shout! </em>author Norman would have <em>anything</em> left to say about Lennon that could constitute that much of a revelation at this stage in the game.<br><br>Credit where credit's due, though. One juicy morsel from <em>The Word</em>'s sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of slightly salacious highlights has attracted the attention of <em>The Sun</em> (a newspaper which, in one of those happy instances of synergy so prevalent in our contemporary media landscape, shares an owner with Norman's publisher). The nub at the core of this supposed nugget is the existence of an audiotape, recorded in 1979, in which John Lennon remembers feeling a momentary incestuous impulse towards his mother at the hormonally impressionable age of 14.</p> <p>'It was never meant for public consumption, but has now leaked out,' an anonymous 'friend of Norman' observes primly of the cassette in question. Oh well, I suppose we'll just have to try and make the best of this entirely unforeseeable set of circumstances by considering the evidence destiny has laid before us. </p> <p>'We were lying on the bed,' Lennon is said to have recalled, 'and I was thinking \"I wonder if I should do anything else?\"' Whether this admission could be said to constitute a seismic news event, coming as it does from the writer of 1970's highest profile Oedipal power ballad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmhRm_92L_8\">'Mother'</a> (with its ear-catching opening couplet <a href=\"http://www.lyricsfreak.com/l/lennon+john/mother_20082499.html\">'Mother, you had me, but I never had you'</a>), is somewhat of a moot point.</p> <p>But even setting aside Lennon's track record in this area, is his confession of a fleeting adolescent frisson really such a big deal? After all, surely every teenage boy worth his salt - and many a teenage girl - has sustained an improper erotic fantasy about John Lennon's mother at some stage in his (or her) psycho-sexual development.</p> <p>Norman's other headline revelation is still less of a jaw-dropper. The identity of the woman at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkcRZSdc8us&amp;feature=related\">'Norwegian Wood'</a> is a 'mystery' so lacking in emotional resonance that Ian MacDonald's Beatles know-it-all's set-text <em>Revolution in the Head</em> devotes precisely ten words to it, calmly noting that the song was 'supposedly about an affair Lennon was having with a journalist'. MacDonald wisely preferred to focus his attention on the far more interesting question of 'Norwegian Wood''s role in the ongoing rivalry between Lennon and Bob Dylan, the latter's influence on its lyric being so generally evident as to attract mockery not only from the Lennon's bandmates, but also from Dylan himself (via the gnomically satirical <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArI26I9rip0\">'4th Time Around'</a>).</p> <p>Philip Norman's case for claiming that the subject of the song was not the <em>Evening Standard</em>'s Maureen Cleave, but the wife of Beatles photographer Robert Freeman, seems to be reasonably plausible. Not only did the lady in question claim to be Norwegian (while actually \u2013 a perplexing detail whose explanation presumably awaits the attention of future generation of biographers \u2013 coming from Germany). She also lived in a flat in South Kensington that was decorated with Scandinavian wood panelling.</p> <p>How much this new knowledge adds to our enjoyment or appreciation of 'Norwegian Wood' itself is, at best, open to debate. But I for one would really rather not be aware of the fact that Mrs Freeman's tree-lined apartment was just downstairs from the one her husband had kindly arranged for John Lennon to move himself, his wife Cynthia and son Julian into. (When a friend does me a favour I always feel taking them out for a meal or buying them a pint suffices as an expression of gratitude: it's really not necessary to sleep with their wife as well.) </p> <p>Yet having conducted a rigorously scientific test, by listening again to 'Norwegian Wood' straight after nibbling at Philip Norman's mouldy Cox's Orange Pippin of circumstantial enlightenment, it is a great relief to discover that the song's faux-Nordic pseudo-folk allure remains defiantly uncompromised. And while John Lennon's music fights tooth and nail to retain its mystery in the face of a biographer's invasive attentions, <em>Q</em>'s 50 page (yes, 50!) Oasis special finds the new album by Burnage's most famously up-for-it Beatles fans taking a respectful back seat to allow the lads themselves to do their best work.</p> <p>Say what you like about the relative lack of artistic development in Oasis' 16-year history (at least as compared with The Beatles' eight), but there is no denying their creative fecundity in terms of interviews. It seems like only yesterday that Liam Gallagher last appeared on the front of <em>Mojo</em>, looking like <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/10/inky_fingers_maggoty_lamb_pick.html\">the dyspeptic lovechild of Todd Rundgren and <em>Cold Feet</em>'s Helen Baxendale</a>, but here he is again, gracing one of <em>Q</em>'s 'collectable' covers with a pudding-bowl haircut so ludicrously well-defined that even Noel's former employer - him out of the Inspiral Carpets - might have considered it excessive.</p> <p>The great thing about a big Oasis feature is that there is no requirement to listen to their music in order to enjoy it. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeCVAGD53Ss\">Liam's searching critique of Gordon Ramsay's cuisine </a>('Hiding the sweet potato round the back of the lamb chop,' that was his big mistake, apparently) and plans to commission a huge Andy Warhol-style portrait of Spongebob Squarepants are democratically available to everyone, irrespective of their willingness (or otherwise) to invest in<em> Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth</em> (or whatever it is they've called the new album this time). And if you choose to skip fairly lightly through the full-page interviews with Andy Bell and Gem Archer (not an innovation <em>Q </em>or any of its rivals will be repeating at any time in the near future, I'd imagine), well, there's no law against that, is there? </p> <p>When Noel expresses uncertainty as to the exact function of 'the tall fella' in Radiohead ('I know what little Tom does, I know what Jonny does, I know what Colin does, I know what the Samaritan does on drums, what do you do?') he is not just having a bit off innocent fun at the expense of a slightly po-faced rival attraction. As conservative as it might initially seem, the senior Gallagher brother's no-nonsense everyman posture is actually a valuable corrective to the self-interest masquerading as altruism which seems to be the default setting of 21st-century music business discourse.</p> <p>It's reassuring to know that there's still at least one premier league rock star with the balls to proclaim (as Noel does when asked if Oasis ever considered giving their album away for free) 'We didn't hire out Abbey Road for two months at two grand a day and then go to America with the most expensive producer in LA to come back and say \"You know what? 'Ave it\".' Especially in a climate of free download-induced hysteria so pervasive it induced <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/radiohead/37581\">Bono to write a letter to the <em>NME</em></a> clearing up any misunderstandings which may have arisen with regard to his respect for Thom Yorke's 'bravery'. (OK, this last distressing event took place some months ago now, but it's taken me this long to pluck up the courage to face up to it in writing.)</p>",
  "<p>Last week, when I was browsing news about Malaysia from home, the words \"arrests\" and \"ISA\" sprang out at me and made me put all my work to one side. I was distressed to read that three arrests were made by Malaysian police under the Internal Security Act (ISA): the prominent blogger and online media editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/12/malaysia.pressandpublishing\">Raja Petra Kamarudin</a>, journalist Tan Hoon Cheng and opposition politician Teresa Kok MP. </p> <p>The arrests bring our attention to two major issues: the ISA and the true reasons behind its enforcement.</p> <p>Firstly, the act and its enforcement are against human rights. In force since 1960, the act is a preventive detention law. Under the act, a person may be detained by the police for up to 60 days without trial for an act which allegedly prejudices the security of the country or any part thereof. After that, the person may be further detained, to be reviewed and approved by the minister of home affairs every two years. During the 60 days, the detainee is deprived of contact with the outside world \u2013 including family members and lawyer \u2013 and former detainees have testified to being subjected to severe physical and psychological torture.</p> <p>Secondly, the act is nothing but a tool for the ruling party, the Barisan National (BN), to suppress dissident voices. Since its enactment, the act has been used against people who criticise the government and defend human rights. For decades, for supposedly \"threatening the security and the economy of the country\", political opponents of the BN government and human rights activists have been put behind bars. During <a href=\"http://www.aliran.com/oldsite/hr/js3.html\">Operation Lalang</a> in 1987, for example, opposition leaders and social activists were held under this act after mass arrests.</p> <p>Close studies of the recent detainments indicate that these measures only expose the incompetence of the United Malaysia National Organisation-led government. </p> <p>To begin with, prior to Sin Chew Daily senior reporter Tan's arrest, she reported the claims made by a Malay BN politician that the Chinese \u2013 who have been settled in the country for more than a century \u2013 were merely \"<a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/11/asia/AS-Malaysia-Racial-Worries.php\">squatters</a>\" in Malaysia. Tan's dramatic <a href=\"http://www.mysinchew.com/node/16234\">arrest and release</a> within 18 hours was a ridiculous overreaction. Home affairs minister Syed Hamid Albar made an ambiguous statement, saying that the police \"were only protecting [her]\" and \"[getting] all the necessary information from her\". It is saddening that a government leader would have to put a civilian in detention to \"protect\" her. It is also absurd that it was she who became the target and not the person who made racist remarks that denied the rights of Chinese people in the country.</p> <p>Confusion of a similar sort surrounded the arrest of Teresa Kok, who was released on September 19. Prior to her arrest, it was claimed by the Malay daily Utusan Malaysia and its columnist that she \"advised\" a mosque not to use loudspeakers while making the call to prayer. Both Kok and most importantly, the mosque in question, denied the allegation and yet she was arrested for \"involvement in acts that can be considered as prejudicial to the security of the country\", an allegation which is also applied to Raja Petra, who is a keen critic of the money politics, corruption and ethnic polarisation that is deeply rooted in Malaysian society.</p> <p>In view of the recent political developments in Malaysia, it is not difficult to relate the arrests to the rise of the opposition party led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/malaysia\">Anwar Ibrahim</a>, the former deputy prime minister who was put in jail for nearly 10 years on corruption and sodomy charges. The ISA is used to instigating fear among the people of a repetition of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_13_Incident\">May 13 race riots</a>. It is a tool for the ailing government to hang on to power. As long as the act exists, Malaysia cannot regard itself as a true democracy.</p>",
  "<p>By forcing out President Thabo Mbeki so vindictively, the <a href=\"http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=lists/ancnec.html&amp;title=ANC+NEC\">ANC leadership</a> may have to sacrifice Jacob Zuma, the party leader, to prevent a backlash that could break up the party ahead of next year's general elections. </p> <p>Today \u2013 as expected \u2013 a third of Mbeki's cabinet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/southafrica.mbeki1\">resigned</a> in anger with the way he has been treated, deepening the biggest political crisis since South Africa became democratic in 1994. Since Mbeki's resignation on Sunday, Zuma had pleaded with Cabinet ministers not to resign \u2013 with limited success. Some ANC leaders have said they will form their own party, to challenge a Zuma-led ANC in next year's general election. This shows the extent of the dissatisfaction among the ANC rank-and-file, even those who have been traditionally critical of Mbeki, who had only four months left on his presidential term. Other ANC members are now planning mass protests across the country. The only way to unify the ANC is not to have Zuma president of South Africa, and make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/southafrica4\">Kgalema Motlanthe</a>, the caretaker president, the permanent candidate. </p> <p>Zuma may be popular, and have a hardcore, loud and militant support base who are prepared to \"die\" to have him president, but at the same time, a large proportion of the ANC's membership disapprove of him with equal gusto. They are unlikely to vote for the ANC when he is the presidential candidate. For the ANC to think that Mbeki's forced exit will \"unify the party\", as ANC general secretary <a href=\"http://news.my.msn.com/topstories/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1687408\">Gwede Mantashe</a> said when he announced Mbeki's sacking, is to be in denial, the favourite response to crises, of the very man they ousted. </p> <p>It is unlikely that those who determinedly moved to oust Mbeki understood the significance of what they have done. They have unleashed a political hurricane, which they cannot control. Mbeki was fired by the Zuma group in charge of the ANC, because they feared he would set up a commission investigating corruption related to the controversial arms deal, in which Zuma is implicated, or recharge him. Zuma has 16 charges of corruption against him. Judge Chris Nicholson, who cleared Zuma on a technicality, emphasised he did not give a verdict on the charges, but proposed the prosecutors recharge Zuma, provided they do so by following the proper procedures. The prosecutors have been under such an attack from the Zuma camp now that their very credibility may rest on recharging Zuma. In any event, they know that if Zuma comes to power, the prosecuting unit may be broken up. Furthermore, a number of private prosecutions against Zuma have been lined up \u2013 so it is difficult to see how Zuma is going to extricate himself out of the very real criminal charges, which have already seen his former financial advisor sent to jail for 15 years. </p> <p>Following Mbeki's forced exit, the Zuma coalition, consisting of five distinctly different groups, who were all opposed to Mbeki, have lost the glue that held them together \u2013 opposition to Mbeki. Furthermore, with Mbeki gone, all of them are now focusing on securing their own interests in the leadership vacuum. Within the Zuma coalition, not all are set on securing the presidency of South Africa for Zuma. Those who are include: the <a href=\"http://70.84.171.10/~etools/anc/youth/index.php\">ANC youth league</a>, the pro-Zuma black economic empowerment business oligarchs \u2013 both hoping to secure patronage; the communist party (SACP) and the trade unionists (Cosatu), who nave no alternative presidential candidate of their own, think they can manipulate Zuma in power; and those ANC leaders who are being investigated by the national prosecuting authority for corruption, because, they argue that if Zuma's case is quashed \u2013 especially when he comes to power, theirs will also. </p> <p>Now the Zuma coalition are divided between those who want Zuma at all costs to become president, such as those seeking a pardon for corruption or patronage, versus those who are prepared to look for a unifying ANC leader that will be pro-poor \u2013 the latter include the more serious elements of Cosatu and the SACP. Yet, Zuma is not entirely in control of his own coalition: rather they may actually be in charge of him. He opposed efforts to oust Mbeki, because he feared he will inherit a divided party, unprepared to run a general election. However, he was rudely overruled by his own militants. Furthermore, in the week when Mbeki detractors within the Zuma coalition moved to oust him, all the old presidential rivals of Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, Mathews and Tokyo Sexwale, again took centre stage within the ANC, dwarfing Zuma, almost like a decade ago. </p> <p>Until yesterday, the Zuma camp, in control of the ANC had planned to appoint <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/19/southafrica1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews\">Baleka Mbete</a>, the speaker of parliament, and the ANC's chairwoman, and a more pliable supporter, as interim president, to smooth the way for Zuma and to create an environment for Zuma's legal charges to be withdrawn. However, Motlanthe's elevation as interim president shows that divisions with Zuma's coalition are now deepening. Motlanthe was the choice of those in the Zuma coalition who are more interested in keeping the ANC united, and securing a pro-poor government focus, rather then putting Zuma into the presidency. They have long seen him as an alternative candidate for the presidency if Zuma stumbles over his legal hurdles. Motlanthe does things by the book. Motlanthe is also one of the few ANC leaders with support in both the Mbeki and Zuma camps. Zuma rightly perceives him as a serious rival. </p> <p>In this crisis, there may be openings for other young Turks of Motlanthe's generation. To contain the young Turks \u2013 Motlanthe, Phosa, Sexwale and Ramaphosa, Zuma has promised to stay as president for one term only, and then allow a competitive election for the leadership between them. But Mothlante will now have inside track, because he is already an MP, while the others, including Zuma are not. He will be presiding president for six months, which is enough to show his credentials not only as a unifying figure, but a source of new ideas, energy and principle, and to contrast this to the divisive potential of a populist Zuma. </p> <p>It will be ironic if it takes the ANC to go through such a destructive process, if it eventually get some sense and appoint Motlanthe or any other of the younger talent, Phosa, Sexwale and Ramaphosa as new leader, such an obvious solution to unite the ANC and the country again, and should have been done a long time before.</p>",
  "<p>The Bush administration's proposed $700bn bailout of cash-strapped Wall Street banks received a rancorous hearing in Congress today as lawmakers demand safeguards, extra details and more time to scrutinise the way the Treasury intends to spend the money.</p> <p>Under questioning by the senate banking committee on Capitol Hill, treasury secretary Henry Paulson clashed repeatedly with questioners as he admitted that he only had a rough idea of how his department would price and purchase troubled mortgage-backed securities.</p> <p>Paulson, appearing alongside the Federal Reserve's chairman Ben Bernanke, resisted calls to crack own on excessive Wall Street pay packages but gave ground on providing aid to homeowners and on allowing an independent board to scrutinise the planned fund's investments.</p> <p>Describing this summer's financial crisis as \"embarrassing for the United States of America\", Paulson said \"thousands\" of banks would be eligible to sell assets to the government.</p> <p>\"This is all about the American taxpayer - that's all we care about,\" said Paulson. \"This is not something I ever wanted to ask for but it's better than the alternative.\"</p> <p>At one point, his comments were jeered by protesters who held up signs saying \"no Paulson plunder\" and \"no blank check\". But Paulson's words were echoed by Bernanke, who gave a blunt warning that the US faces a prolonged recession unless the government acts: \"If the credit markets are not functioning, jobs will be lost, unemployment will rise, more homes will be foreclosed upon and GDP will contract.\"</p> <p>\"The secretary and the [Bush] administration need to know what they have sent to us is not acceptable. This is not going to work,\" Chris Dodd, Democratic chairman of the banking committee, told reporters after Paulson's appearance. \"And they're going to have to come back and work with us.\"</p> <p>Dodd's Republican counterpart, conservative senator Richard Shelby, appeared to concur. \"I think we've got to look at some alternatives,\" he said. \"I think the secretary now realizes that what he sent up is not going to be just rubber-stamped.\"</p> <p>Legislators have pointed out that they initially only received a three-page summary of how the government's intervention will work. They questioned how the Treasury intends to determine the price it will pay for obscure mortgage-backed derivatives which have been all but abandoned by the financial markets.</p> <p>Paulson said he anticipated some form of \"reverse auction\" whereby banks will compete to sell their unwanted securities for the lowest price. But he admitted the process would require \"experimentation\" and promised the Treasury would recruit a roster of experts to help.</p> <p>\"This is not a situation where we can come and say 'this is what we want to do, this is how we're going to price it and this is how the reverse auctions are going to work.\", Paulson told the committee. \"We've said upfront we're going to need some experimentation.\"</p> <p>This explanation left many senators dissatisfied. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, said: \"You're flying by the seat of your pants. You want the capital to be there but you're not quite sure what you're going to do with it.\"<br>A Republican, Mike Enzi, asked: \"Shouldn't we have the process designed before we have to do a $700bn experiment?\"</p> <p>The pricing mechanism is widely considered to be critical. If the Treasury pays too little for troubled securities, it will fail to help staggering banks which could still collapse. But if it pays too much, the government will be unable to sell them on, landing taxpayers with huge liabilities.</p> <p>After initially asking for virtually unchecked power, Paulson has agreed in principle to the creation of a board which will oversee investments. He has also suggested that he is open to some form of aid for struggling homeowners as part of the package.</p> <p>But the administration continues to baulk at introducing any legislative curbs on Wall Street salaries. Paulson, who earned up to $30m annually in his previous job heading Goldman Sachs, said compensation was an issue which ought to be dealt with separately.</p> <p>\"I've heard your concerns on executive compensation and I share those frustrations,\" he said, adding that he was equally \"upset\" by certain examples of excess.</p> <p>The emergency package has prompted vigorous reactions around the world. The Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, pointed out this week that the bail-out will cost four times the amount his nation produces in a year,. He described the financial turmoil as a sign that his \"21st century socialism\" was the way forward.</p> <p>In Congress, Democrats have proposed allowing the government to take equity stakes in return for aid to troubled banks. There have suggested that money pledged to the program should be phased, rather than provided all at once.</p> <p>Christopher Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the banking committee, said he remained deeply concerned about the precedent set by the package: \"I can only conclude that it's not only our economy that's at risk but out constitution as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>George Bush stood unrepentant and unbowed before the 192 member states of the UN general assembly today to deliver a valedictory address devoted almost entirely to terrorism which he described as an evil that must be defeated.</p> <p>In his eighth and final address to a largely silent hall of world leaders, the US president sounded a note that has changed remarkably little since he first spoke to the general assembly in the wake of the September 11 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p>He said the global movement of violent extremists remained a challenge as serious as any since the foundation of the UN in 1945: \"Like slavery and piracy, terrorism has no place in the modern world.\"</p> <p>Bush took the opportunity to give an assessment of his two terms in power that contained no regrets and no apology.</p> <p>Afghanistan and Iraq had been transformed, he said, \"from regimes that actively sponsor terror to democracies that fight terror.\" Libya had renounced its backing of extremists and dropped its pursuit for nuclear weapons, and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were engaged in the struggle to root out extremism.</p> <p>Democracy too, had spread around the world under his watch. </p> <p>\"From the voting booths of Afghanistan, Iraq and Liberia, to the orange revolution in Ukraine, the rose revolution in Georgia, the cedar revolution in Lebanon and the tulip revolution in Kyrgyzstan, we have seen people consistently make the courageous decision to demand their liberty. Whenever or wherever people are given the choice, they chose freedom.\"</p> <p>In the seven years since Bush launched the so-called war on terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, his administration has become among the most controversial in US history. </p> <p>It has been widely criticised on the world stage for flouting international law, and for ineffective handling of the aftermaths of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Amid those criticisms, the speech comes at a time when many of the objectives of the Bush administration appear to be facing reverses. The Taliban are on the rise again in Afghanistan, violence is rife in Pakistan, the Middle East peace initiative is stalled and attempts to stop Iran and North Korea from developing a nuclear capacity are wavering.</p> <p>There was only passing reference to such downsides to his legacy during the 21 minutes of the speech. The only hint at fallibility came with the concession that \"we have witnessed successes and setbacks\" and a reference to the fight in Iraq as having been \"difficult\".</p> <p>The decision to go ahead with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 in the absence of approval from the UN, which Bush derided as being close to an irrelevance, constituted one of the most serious blows to the authority of the world body since its founding. </p> <p>Bush hinted at the upheaval by talking about the \"disagreements our nations have had on Iraq\" but added that daily life in the country had improved dramatically in the past two years and \"we should all welcome this progress towards stability and peace.\"</p> <p>The president had direct words to say the delegations seated in front of him from Russia, which he said had violated the UN charter by sending troops into Georgia. \"We must stand united in our support of the people of Georgia. Young democracies around the world are watching to see how we respond to this test.\"</p> <p>He also singled out North Korea and Iran for their nuclear programmes, calling on the UN to impose stiffened sanctions against both, and Iran and Syria for continuing to sponsor terror.</p> <p>The inclusion of Iran on both his lists of culprits was not lost on the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in New York to address the UN general assembly himself later today. The Iranian leader has threatened to \"break the hand\" of anyone who tries to touch the country's nuclear facilities.</p> <p>In a radio interview, Ahmadinejad turned the record of the Bush years back on itself. \"I'd like to ask you, is it the Iranian [army] that's around the territories around the country, or is it the US troops that are around? It is the US troops around our borders. It is not ours around the American borders. So what exactly are they doing over there?\"</p> <p>The issue of Iran's nuclear programme will feature in behind-the-scenes meetings this week at the UN, including a gathering of six foreign ministers from the five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany to discuss a further tightening of the screws on Tehran.</p> <p>Bush made a brief reference in his speech to the global financial crisis, reportedly changing the text to insert words of reassurance that the $700bn rescue package for Wall Street would soon be passed by Congress.</p>",
  "<p>The world is just emerging from a week of financial turmoil which has dissolved old certainties about the economic system structuring our lives. Yet despite the fact that commentators regularly assure us that we have just witnessed a meltdown of truly global proportions, we've been treated to more pictures of bedraggled London bankers clutching cardboard boxes than we have to any concrete analysis of how the events of past few days are perceived beyond the west.</p> <p>On Wednesday last week, the Guardian featured a selection of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/recession.labour\">quotes</a> from prominent leftwingers on whether capitalism has had its day, a worthy contribution to the debate at a time when the <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/edmund_conway/blog/2008/09/19/five_ways_the_financial_crisis_is_already_changing_the_world\">Telegraph</a> is heralding the end of the world as we know it and Times readers are quoting Marx on the newspaper's online message-boards. But although the demise of the free market may appear a somewhat jarring prospect over cornflakes in Kent, in many parts of the world the ideological spectrum of mainstream political and economic thinking extends far beyond blind faith in the markets \u2013 leaving those governments who have staked their credibility on IMF and World Bank-led neoliberal reforms vulnerable to social unrest.</p> <p>One such country is Egypt, where the long process of reversing Nasser's socialist economic policies of the 1950s and 1960s that was begun under President Sadat and intensified by the current regime, has produced strong growth rates in recent years. However, these percentage points have come at the cost of destroying social welfare institutions and have fuelled spiralling inflation and unemployment. Despite the presence of an ostentatious middle-class enjoying the fruits of economic liberalisation, capitalism is not accepted as an inevitability by many on the ground facing <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/inDepthNews/idUSL0404033220080406?sp=true\">bloodshed</a> in the subsidised bread queues that have lengthened as the government's free-market programmes begin to bite. In this context, the latest round of financial chaos threatens to tip an already <a href=\"http://www.hackwriters.com/EygptwaitingJS.htm\">volatile</a> political situation over the edge.</p> <p>So how will chaos on Wall Street shape political and economic developments in the Arab world's largest country? I spoke to figures from across the political divide and asked them how they thought the financial meltdown would impact upon them and their country.</p> <p>Rania al-Malky, editor of the independent newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dailystaregypt.com/\">Daily News Egypt</a>. The state-controlled press is being increasingly challenged by a new wave of independent media outlets which have been vociferous in their criticism of the government's economic policies:</p> <blockquote> <p>The impact of the meltdown on Egypt may not be felt by the average Egyptian right now, but it will certainly take its toll within months, especially if the Egyptian pound continues its devaluation against the dollar. A lopsided foreign exchange rate is detrimental to an economy like Egypt, which is service-oriented rather than industry and production-based. Although our exports have increased significantly over the past two years, we still rely almost entirely on imports to support our industries and for agricultural staples like wheat. So with a weakening Egyptian pound, both prices and inflation are bound to keep shooting up, ultimately to the detriment of the struggling Egyptian masses.</p> <p>Inflamed social sentiment against the ruling regime will naturally ensue, especially at a time when news of the corruption of businessmen and politicians is exposed daily in the media and displays of negligence and the utter lack of competence of bodies like the civil defence authority have revealed beyond a shadow of a doubt that the current administration is incapable of dealing with emergencies.</p> <p>As for the effect of an economic recession on the opposition, we must distinguish between the generally impotent official opposition parties and the increasingly effective and powerful civil-society based movements that have been able to kick up a lot of dust to lobby for workers' rights and against rising prices. Any serious economic downturn in Egypt will boost the appeal of such grassroots movements and banned Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hossam el-Hamalawy, a dissident <a href=\"http://arabist.net/arabawy/\">blogger</a> and member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Socialists. The web has become a vibrant outlet for many in Egypt for criticising government's policies and exposing economic corruption:</p> <blockquote> <p>Neoliberal theorists and apologists have never been on the defensive as they are today. Economic crises have already hit several countries marked as distinguished 'reformers' by international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank, whose victims were generally workers and the urban poor. Here in Egypt, our economy on paper is booming, with a 7.1% GDP growth rate, yet inflation has already hit 25% and basic commodities have either disappeared from the local market or increased over 50% in price. Two popular uprisings have already taken place this year and this is happening on the back of the biggest strike wave in the country since the end of the second world war. We know panic travels at the speed of light through stock markets, and of course Egypt will not be immune from an economic collapse in the west, because our economy is integrated into the global market and is subject to its fluctuations. I think we can also expect a significant drop in Egypt's tourism revenues, with less people in the US and elsewhere affording vacations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Abdelaziz EzzelArab, director of the Economic and Business History Research Centre at the <a href=\"http://www.aucegypt.edu/Pages/default.aspx\">American University in Cairo</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Capitalism has proven resilient and adaptable in its history of dealing with crises, and although it will not collapse overnight, it will gradually evolve into an increasingly regulated market and ultimately some form of market socialism. How will this be perceived by Egyptians? Probably with a shrug of the shoulder, if not with a sense of content. Two broad factors contributed in recent years to a dramatic reversal in the public mood towards capitalism, which followed the initial excitement surrounding the hesitant steps towards a free market taken from the late 1970s to the mid 1990s. One factor comes from abroad: the attitude, policies, and actions of the US which have earned it the popular image of an \"evil empire\". The other is domestic: the bitter record of the market in the past 17 years since the adoption of free market mechanisms through 'economic reform and structural adjustment policies'.</p> <p>The outcome of the reforms was an unholy alliance of political and business magnates, to the benefit of a tiny clique that controls both domains to the detriment of the masses. The scandals, crimes, and failures in 2008 alone are too numerous to recount and have become common talk even among ruling party columnists. The nation's experience with the system is that it lacks compassion, a basic trait in Egypt's social fabric, and it thus becomes perceived negatively. When the system is severely shaken in its global centres, as is happening now, it will likely be seen as a deserved end for capitalism, in a way not dissimilar to the attitude towards the collapse of the USSR \u2013 perceived by the public as the expected end of a tyrannical model.</p> <p>Recurrent scandals eradicated much of the regime's moral foundation in recent months. The current crisis of capitalism is untimely for the regime, inasmuch as it deprives it from the ideological underpinning of its present economic policies. The theoretical soundness of the adopted model is itself doubted and its dilemma is therefore deepened. It may be a ripe moment for the regime to realise the necessity of embracing recent calls for a new constituent assembly that would lay the grounds for an alternative order and a new constitution. But this presumes a sense of political far-sightedness that the regime has not so far displayed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Abdul Hamid al-Ghazali, consul to the supreme guide of the <a href=\"http://www.ikhwanweb.com/\">Muslim Brotherhood</a> and professor of economics at Cairo University. Despite being officially outlawed, the Brotherhood is the strongest parliamentary opposition group to the ruling NDP and the most tightly-organised Islamist political force in Egypt. It has been criticised by other opposition movements for being supportive of free-market capitalism:</p> <blockquote> <p>We are in a chaotic situation in Egypt by our own making. We are witnessing corruption scandals every day, all of which are symptoms of shocking economic management. Over and above, we now have this international economic chaos which is being reflected in our own financial markets. I don't think foreign investors will be deterred from putting money into our economy, but the foreign and domestic factors together do make the situation very dramatic at a time when the government is already very weak. It has no popular support, no strength, and for the regime this financial crisis is the beginning of the end.</p> <p>The Muslim Brotherhood has been supportive of the free market and against monopolistic practices, and we continue to maintain that stance. The difference between our economic programme and that of the current regime is that we oppose the corruption and monopolising that has led to key strategic industries like oil and steel being destabilised. But free-market reforms, with strong government safeguards to prevent these kind of practices, remain Egypt's best hope for progress. </p> <p>Although we have suffered a lot from this government's economic reforms I don't think the Egyptian people have lost faith in the free market altogether. A managed free market that serves the public and provides for fairness and security, instead of capitalism which serves the interests of the regime alone, this is what people want. The crisis gives the whole country an opportunity, a chance for a new constitution and a new choice of government through the ballot box.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Lusting after videogame characters is possibly the most undignified pastime known to humankind, but that hasn't stopped millions making an exception for Lara Croft. The delectable kick-ass heroine is poised to return to our consoles in her latest starring vehicle, <a href=\"http://www.tombraider.com/\">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>, set to arrive in the UK on November 21 (November 18 in the US). </p> <p>When it launches, it will undoubtedly be the most important release in publisher Eidos's entire existence. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/16/games\">The company (a subsidiary of SCi) is in such dire straits</a>, early this year it binned no fewer than 14 games it had in development. </p> <p>So does Lara still have her magic touch in the 21st century, and can she single-handedly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/11/games\">extricate Eidos from the mire</a>? Time to find out with some hands-on experience of a pre-release build of the game.</p> <p>Tomb Raider: Underworld is the first iteration of the series that has been specifically designed for next-generation consoles, so the first thing you notice is that it looks stunning. The storyline is established by an intriguing cut-scene in which Croft Manor is set on fire, and then you're straight into what is essentially a tutorial mini-level. In it, you must extract Lara from her flaming home. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337911512\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/lara9.inset.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb Raider: Underworld\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thailand scene from Tomb Raider: Underworld</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This confirms that the basic controls are pretty much the same as ever, although her recently acquired grapple \u2013 which plays a more prominent part than in previous games \u2013 has been improved. It will still only hook onto strategically placed brass rings, but you can now attach it before running and jumping, and Lara can use it to abseil. Once you've escaped from Croft Manor, the game proper begins: in a flash Lara is in an impressive gin palace on the Mediterranean coast that, handily, comes stocked with an aqualung: don that, and you can jump into an underwater level, without having to worry about Lara drowning. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337911513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/lara2.inset.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb Raider: Underworld\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomb Raider: Underworld</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Proper, involved underwater puzzle-solving ensues, involving one of the game's recurring themes \u2013 searching for objects (often along the lines of carved sticks or keystones) that can be slotted into holes to operate environmental puzzles. The puzzles very much take centre stage in Tomb Raider: Underworld, to such an extent that developer Crystal Dynamics has completely abandoned boss-battles, which always tended to err on the side of tediousness in previous releases.</p> <p>Eidos and Crystal Dynamics would, of course, have to take leave of their senses before messing with Tomb Raider's gameplay: the franchise has sold more than 30m units. And sure enough, Tomb Raider: Underworld will feel reassuringly familiar to anyone who has played a Tomb Raider of yore. The focus, clearly, has been on subtle improvement of a successful formula.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337911560\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/lara3.inset.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb Raider: Underworld\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Kraken from Tomb Raider: Underworld</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The time-slowing Focus mode that appeared in Tomb Raider: Anniversary is back, but it has been subtly tweaked: you can launch whenever Lara's adrenaline meter is full. The game cheats slightly by automatically filling it at certain points, such as when negotiating the fiercest traps (we encountered a room filled with whirling blades and so forth that would be virtually impossible to negotiate in anything other than slo-mo). </p> <p>The other big gameplay tweak is more about honing the level design: the bad old days of having to find the one precise path have gone, and throughout the game you will always have several different ways of getting to where you want to be. Intriguingly, there's a sonar-style 3D map on tap, too.</p> <p>Lara herself feels more forgiving than previously \u2013 which will please those who suffered their way through Tomb Raider 2, in which you would often perish if your positioning was a single pixel out of kilter. She looks and moves better than ever: Tomb Raider: Underworld is the first game in which Lara's movements have been dictated by motion capture rather than hand animation (Crystal Dynamics used a gymnast-cum-stuntwoman called Heidi Moneymaker). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337911514\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2008/09/23/lara11.inset.jpg\" alt=\"Tomb Raider: Underworld\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thailand scene from Tomb Raider: Underworld</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The attention to the detail of Lara's movements is impressive: she often stumbles on landing and her ponytail swings when she runs, for example. Plus, she can free-climb those surfaces studded with hand-holds, as well as, for the first time, pull herself up to stand on even the narrowest of ledges. As ever, much of the game's joy derives from controlling a character who moves so delightfully. If only we could sign her up for the London 2012 gymnastics team ...</p> <p>The plot \u2013 which takes in exotic locations such as Thailand, Mexico and the Arctic, as well as several underworld locations \u2013 centres on statues and artefacts of the god Thor, which keep cropping up a long way from Scandinavia. 21st century mores do impinge. For example, you can now choose to shoot animals with a tranquilliser gun rather than a lethal weapon, though if you can't kill endangered species in a videogame, where can you?</p> <p>Overall, Tomb Raider: Underworld is deeply impressive: it's Tomb Raider with its strengths emphasised and the annoying aspects removed or neutralised. </p> <p>The franchise appears to have weathered the storm generated by the sheer awfulness of 2003's Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, the making of which saw original developer Core Design self-destruct in spectacular fashion. Indeed, the fact that the last Tomb Raider game, Anniversary, was merely a solidly executed remake of the original now makes sense \u2013 Crystal Dynamics was using it as a sort of dress rehearsal for Tomb Raider: Underworld. </p> <p>Lara isn't dead yet.</p>",
  "<p>The proposed $700bn bailout of US financial markets faced harsh criticism in Congress today, with liberals and conservatives both sceptical that granting the Bush administration power to buy up risky mortgages would avert further economic crisis.</p> <p>Yet despite the wariness from the Senate banking committee, where Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke appeared today, the financial rescue seems poised to win approval by next week at the latest.</p> <p>\"This is not something I wanted to ask for,\" the US treasury secretary said, assuring senators that \"I feel your frustrations\" and \"I'm angry\" at the prospect of Wall Street firms getting saved by the government.</p> <p>But Paulson and Bernanke did ask for broad latitude to decide which toxic assets would win a purchase by the government. Senators of both parties did not attempt to hide their anger at the request, citing the Bush administration's previous assurances of market stability.</p> <p>\"We have been given no credible assurances that this plan will work,\" Richard Shelby, the senior Republican on the banking panel, said. \"Congress does not have time to determine if there are better alternatives.\"</p> <p>The committee's Democratic chairman, Chris Dodd, questioned Paulson's request for immunity from any legal or government review of his actions during the bailout process.</p> <p>\"After reading this proposal, I can only conclude that it is not just our economy that is at risk,\" Dodd told the treasury secretary, \"but our constitution as well.\"</p> <p>Bernanke offered little detail on how the government would set the value of troubled mortgages before buying them. Yet America's senior banker appeared conscious to avoid potential conflicts of interest, particularly given Paulson's past chairmanship of Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>\"I'm a college professor,\" Bernanke explained. \"I never worked on Wall Street. I don't have those interests, those connections.\"</p> <p>He then warned senators that \"jobs will be lost, unemployment will rise, more houses will be foreclosed, GDP will contract\" if the rescue plan is not approved.</p> <p>The proposal is expected to become law within days, perhaps as soon as the weekend. What remains unclear is how many changes Congress can make to the bailout in the face of insistence on a \"clean bill\" by Paulson and the White House.</p> <p>Dodd and Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the financial services committee in the House of Representatives, are working on rescue plans that could see separate votes or be merged in advance.</p> <p>The congressional leaders are likely to agree on some key priorities:</p> <p>\u2022 Limits on executive compensation at firms that get government aid. Paulson criticised this idea at first, predicting that it would limit incentive for banks to seek help, but now appears open to the concept. John McCain has backed compensation limits.</p> <p>\u2022 A stake for taxpayers in any firms that the government assists. A Democratic senator, Jack Reed, has proposed issuing stock warrants that would allow the public to share the profits of rebounding companies. Republicans have urged that any profits from the rescue be used to pay down the bloated national debt.</p> <p>\u2022 Direct attention to foreclosures. Democrats want US bankruptcy judges to be allowed to modify mortgages on primary homes, but conservatives view that proposal as a deal-breaker. A compromise could include more money for lenders to modify mortgage rates as well as a government guarantee for the renegotiated loans.</p> <p>But before the $700bn bailout becomes law, Paulson and Bernanke must run the gantlet on Capitol Hill. They are likely to meet with more frustrated congressmen during a visit to Frank's House financial panel tomorrow.</p>",

But the Conservatives accused him of pandering to the left to shore up his ailing premiership.</p> <p>At the start of his 59-minute address Brown admitted he had made mistakes but vowed to work to put them right.</p> <p>Introduced on stage by his wife Sarah, the prime minister said his government would be the \"rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand\".</p> <p>In a swipe at David Cameron, the Conservative leader - and almost certainly at David Miliband, the foreign secretary and his most obvious rival for the top job - the prime minister insisted: \"Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.\"</p> <p>Promising a \"new settlement for new times\", Brown insisted his government stood for a fair Britain for a new age.</p> <p>\"Our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most, Britain's vast majority, people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amidst this change \u2013 we are on their side.\"</p> <p>The prime minister apologised for abolishing the 10p tax band, which hit poorer families. \"What happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes \u2013 because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be.\"</p> <p>Facing critics of his leadership head on, the prime minister said: \"I'm not going to be something I'm not. If people say I'm too serious, there's a lot to be serious about.\"</p> <p>And in another thinly veiled swipe at Cameron, Brown said: \"Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple: my children aren't props, they are people.\"</p> <p>Brown again insisted that he was the right person to lead the country through the current economic turmoil, amid fresh falls in the financial markets that suggested the crisis is far from over.</p> <p>The prime minister paid warm tribute to Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader, and also hailed his predecessor Tony Blair's hand in reshaping the Labour party.</p> <p>Sarah Brown's appearance on stage was a surprise move. She thanked the party for its support before a short video showing the government's achievements, which preceded the prime minister's speech.</p> <p>The film featured a clip of the US Democratic presidential hopeful, Barack Obama, endorsing the prime minister - a move that could prove controversial.</p> <p>Remarking on the warm reception his wife received, the prime minister joked: \"Thank goodness we are a team.\"</p> <p>Brown pledged to extend free nursery places for two-year-olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country, introduce legislation to enshrine Labour's pledge to end child poverty and help more than one million families with free internet access.</p> <p>The prime minister also said that prescription charges would be scrapped from next year for those battling cancer.</p> <p>And, on crime, Brown said the government would appoint an independent commissioner to stand up for victims, witnesses and families.</p> <p>Urging Labour activists to \"stay true to your beliefs\", Brown added: \"Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, on community. Because this job is not about me, it's about you.\"</p>",
  "<p>We at the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> understand that discrimination law can seem complicated and hard to understand. Often we are asked by employers, \"What can I do to make sure I'm not discriminating against anyone?\" In some cases, the answer is not a simple one, but usually it's about common sense and treating people fairly.<br> It starts to get tricky, however, when the law seems at odds with our sense of what's fair and right. Today, an advocate general at the <a href=\"http://curia.europa.eu/en/instit/presentationfr/index_cje.htm\">European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ) suggested that British regulations that force workers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/23/workandcareers.discriminationatwork\">retire at 65</a> do not contravene European law. <br> The ECJ will make its final ruling in about six months, and it is important to remember that today's opinion is not the last word in this important debate. But the campaigning group <a href=\"http://www.heyday.org.uk/\">Heyday</a>, who brought the case, and a great many workers approaching or over 65, have hit a serious bump in the road.<br> The opinion of a court official in Strasbourg may sound academic to some, but it could have profound implications for many. By 2020, two out of five people in the workforce will be aged 45 and over. Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics show that for the first time ever there are more people over the state pensionable age than under 16.  At a time when many people are living longer and healthier lives, and against a backdrop of skills shortages, it certainly does neither them nor us any favours to apply a one-size fits view of what older people are good for and the role they play in our economy. Many employers realize that fairness of this sort is not just a social good, it's an economic imperative. Take major British employers like B&amp;Q, who have already established policies that demonstrate older workers are an asset. Back in 2006, they ran a pilot project at their store in Macclesfield. Staffed entirely with over 50s the store increased its profits by 18%, staff turnover was six times lower and absenteeism went down by 39 per cent. In a similar vein, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) estimates that of all the requests made for postponed retirement last year, 80% were granted. But we at the Commission and the many age charities that have campaigned so tirelessly on this issue are concerned about the one in five people who are forced to retire and have no protection in law. But there is also another issue here. Anyone who hasn't been living on Mars in recent weeks will know in these ever-turbulent times, older workers are increasingly vulnerable to financial insecurity.  A great many employers will of course relish the opportunity to stop work at 65, but sadly for some it is not a matter of choice. Around 17% of pensioners live in poverty, and the latest government figures show that the number of pensioners in poverty rose by 200,000 to 2.1 million after housing costs. More and more people will have to work beyond the traditional retirement age, particularly single older women at risk of poverty in retirement. Countless people will still have mortgages, children to support and bills to pay. Is it right and fair that we close down their options? At this week's party conference, where I will tonight be participating in a debate about Equality and the Ageing Society, one of the words I've heard most is \"fairness\". For me, there's nothing fair about being consigned to the scrap-heap at 65, and we need to ensure that legislation, public spending and future policy ensure real choices for all.</p>",
  "<p>Today's shootings in Finland are the latest in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/23/finland.schoolsworldwide\">long and gruesome history of school massacres</a>.</p> <p>Debate is now likely to focus on what prompts young people to carry out such attacks and what - if anything - can be done to prevent them.</p> <p>Fears have been voiced that the deaths of 11 people, along with the gunman's posting of YouTube footage showing him firing a weapon, will lead to a kneejerk reaction from politicians.</p> <p><a href=\"http://masksoferis.wordpress.com/\">Maskoferis</a>, a Finnish blogger, asks: </p> <blockquote> <p>Should every gun nut that posts a video of himself shooting a few rounds be slapped in chains? Should every youth that scrawls a melancholy, misanthropic note or two somewhere on the internet be hounded by agents, deprived of all guns and sharp objects, shunted to psychological counselling?</p> </blockquote> <p>His view is that this kind of random act can never be prevented:</p> <blockquote> <p>People snap \u2026 and there's no way, short of a fascist police state, to keep people apart from the means of hurting others when they snap. Regrettable things like this do happen, and will happen. It is not a nice thing, but we shouldn't be too hysterical about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>One online group has <a href=\"http://www.corrupt.org/\">blamed society for the massacre</a>, despairing over a world in which teenagers grow up \"confused, angry, hurt and emotionally fragile\". </p> <p>It described the gunman as a \"socially isolated individual\" who was \"desperate to communicate an inherent fault with our communities, but unable to get his voice heard without killing people\".</p> <blockquote> <p>This school massacre is another tragic event marking the ignorance and selfishness of our social environment. How many more deaths will be spilled before we change our lifestyle? When will we ever learn?</p> </blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7630969.stm\">chilling YouTube footage</a> of the gunman has also has provoked questions about whether such sites should allow this kind of clip to be published.</p> <p>The posting has now been taken down, sparking <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/In-Finland-shooting,-fallout-for-YouTube/2010-1025_3-6217468.html\">claims of internet censorship</a>.</p> <p>Today's killings will be the cause of some national soul-searching for Finland, not least about the country's prolific gun culture. </p> <p>The shootings happened less than a year after nine people, including the gunman, died in a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/nov/12/schools.uk\">school shooting</a> in the town of Tuusala, near Helsinki. </p> <p>Is there something in Finnish society that drives some of its teenagers to carry out this kind of horrific act? Are the two recent tragedies the result of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/sep/23/finland.school.shooting.comment\">high levels of domestic violence and suicide</a> in Finland, as some commentators suggest? </p> <p>And how should the authorities, and society, respond?</p>",
  "<p>Some of the biggest and most controversial companies in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/09/partygaming.gambling\">online poker industry</a> could be stripped of their internet domain names after state officials in Kentucky won a seizure order from a US court.</p> <p>The order has been served on domain name registrars for 141 gambling sites that take custom from US players, despite this bring prohibited by Kentucky law and the 2003 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). Targeted firms include the registrars for industry leaders PokerStars and Full Tilt, both of which are small companies based in the UK. </p> <p>PokerStars and Full Tilt have dominated the online poker industry since UIGEA became law, prompting most other operators \u2013 such as London-listed firms PartyGaming, 888 and Sportingbet \u2013 to exit the US almost overnight. But with no assets or operations in the US, it remains difficult for the American authorities to monitor or police the US activities of remaining operators.</p> <p>Nick Wood, managing director of London-based Com Laude, which holds the domain name for PokerStars, said: \"We anticipated this could happen and we've developed an action plan which largely consists of us not responding.\" Milton Keynes-based Safenames, the registrar for Full Tilt, declined to comment.</p> <p>PokerStars and others are believed to be preparing to send a team of lawyers to Kentucky to fight the legal claim, which is being backed by governor Steve Beshear. They are expected to argue the Kentucky courts have no jurisdiction over dotcom domain names registered overseas. Insiders believe they will side-step arguments about whether or not taking cash from US players is in breach of US law.</p> <p>In a statement welcoming the order, Governor Beshear said: \"The owners and operators of these illegal sites prey on Kentucky citizens, including our youth, and deprive the Commonwealth of millions of dollars in revenue. It's an underworld wrought with scams and schemes.\" He described them as \"leeches on our communities\". </p> <p>He conceded the action was in part designed to protect the interests of local horseracing-related gambling. Beshear has campaigned for more casinos to be licensed in Kentucky, prompting some critics to suggest his attacks on online operators looks morally inconsistent.</p> <p>Many industry experts suggested the Kentucky action was unlikely to succeed. \"This is a stunt,\" said a Washington attorney, David Stewart.</p> <p>Last year, online gaming group Bodog lost control of its domain name, which was registered in the US, after a legal dispute. The company quickly resurfaced with a similar name but is believed to have lost significant business as a result.</p> <p>The latest order from the Franklin circuit court of Kentucky has been served on registrar companies in the US and around the world in procedures set out by the California-based <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jun/26/digitalmedia\">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a>, which oversees the assignment of domain names.</p>",
  "<p>As Finland reacted in horror to the shooting by a student at a vocational college in Kauhajoki, now known to have claimed eleven lives, teachers and officials were asking what more could have been done, despite a flurry of initiatives following a shooting less than a year before at Jokela High School which killed eight.</p> <p>Officials had described Finland's first major school shooting at Jokela high school last November as an isolated incident. </p> <p>Nonetheless, the government reacted swiftly, putting special student welfare teams into schools and colleges, including at Kauhajoki's college for home and institutional economics - the location of the latest shooting.</p> <p>\"We already had the experience (of Jokela) and this time the help was available immediately,\" said Anita Lehikoinen, director of higher education at the Finnish ministry of education. \"There were major efforts made to support schools and the school community and to help young people to feel safe in schools. We also sent a letter to all the rectors of polytechnics and colleges to update their safety regulations and to pay special attention to student welfare.\" </p> <p>She insisted the college where the shooting took place was not to blame. </p> <p>\"The institution had taken all the action. They had a multi-professional team of psychologists, social workers in the community, and also a pastor. But still we saw this kind of tragedy take place,\" Lehikoinen said. </p> <p>The government today announced extra financial help for the region, to help train youth workers, community workers and even parish priests to reach out to young people.</p> <p>Although Matti Saari, 22, a student at the college, was a young adult, Lehikoinen said even in higher education there was a close relationship between students and staff, \"particularly at this institution, which is a very small one\".</p> <p>\"There is always the question of whether there enough [welfare] services are available. But at this institution we think this was not a problem. </p> <p>\"With multi-professional teams in place we think the help could have been there,\" Lehikoinen said. </p> <p>However, as a vocational student, about a third of Saari's time was spent in the workplace. A recent European Union study said workplace bullying was more common in Finland than in any other EU country with Finns twice as likely to report harassment than workers in other European countries. </p> <p>Bullying was also an issue in the case of Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who carried out the Jokela shooting. </p> <p>Meanwhile interior minister Anne Holmlund said the perpetrator was questioned by police the day before the shooting, regarding videos posted in recent weeks on YouTube showing him firing a pistol, but no further steps were thought to be necessary. </p> <p>Holmlund said she would step up efforts to draft amendments in the country's firearms law. \"It goes without saying that one must analyse carefully what has happened and what sorts of changes may serve to prevent these kinds of situations from happening,\" Holmlund said. </p> <p>Teachers and officials were searching for clues of a systemic problem in society as education minister Sari Sarkomaa, interior minister Holmlund, and minister of health and social services Paula Risikko met in emergency session to discuss the Kauhajoki shooting. </p> <p>Lehikoinen said the government would be looking at wider issues in society such as greater individualism, and would look to fostering a spirit of community in schools and colleges. </p> <p>\"There is now a major emphasis in community-building in schools,\" she said. </p> <p>After the Jokela incident, cuts in funding for psychological services and social support in recent years were criticised. The shooting had been a wake-up call, and local level collaboration between support services had already increased since then, teachers in Finland said. </p> <p>\"Jokela made teachers more sensitive to student problems. In a very general way it made teachers more alert,\" said Jarkko Hautam\u00e4ki, professor of special education at the University of Helsinki. </p> <p>At first glance, the two incidents do not seem similar. \"The present shooter is a young adult, and so we cannot say the teachers are responsible,\" Hautam\u00e4ki said.</p> <p>\"These are random encounters that cannot be prevented by any specific policy. They are difficult to anticipate and to be able to monitor in any way.\" </p> <p>But media reports have stressed the rising use of the internet among young people and its pernicious influence. Jorma Lempinen, of the Finnish Association of School Principals, said: \"There is a great deal of discussion. Parents say our children are not out on the streets, they are not doing drugs or alcohol, they are at home and we believed they were secure. It is now the opposite, and young people are now unsafe even at home because of the internet?\" </p> <p>Few answers were immediately evident as Finland was digesting the enormity of the latest shooting. </p> <p>\"Both the incident in Jokela and the present incident are very surprising to us. It is very difficult to understand why young people should feel so miserable as to do such desperate acts,\" Hautam\u00e4ki said. </p> <p>\"We have precise and very good plans of what to do in an emergency since the Jokela incident. But these only tackle what is happening afterwards. Teachers are discussing and wondering how do we tackle the problems before they occur,\" Lempinen said. </p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown issued a powerful plea for the importance of government in his conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/gordonbrown.labour1\">speech</a>. It marked an end to the long era in which government was marked down, politicians were embarrassed to speak about it and behaved as if holding office was just an interim pastime before making serious money in memoirs, speeches or directorships.</p> <p>In contrast to the millionaires' row shadow cabinet front bench \u2013 the biggest collection of wealthy people outside Mayfair hedge funds \u2013 Brown invited Labour to remake the case for government. In contrast to the isolationist Tory philosophy with its visceral hostility to Europe, he delivered a speech in which the words global and international appeared more than in any prime minister's speech in years.</p> <p>Tony Blair loftily sailed above the opposition as the Tories provided little or none of it. Brown does not have that luxury \u2013 not just because the Conservatives are now a serious opposition, but because the PM's policies, from tax to public sector pay, have taken daily criticism from some trade union leaders, as well as a 1980s left grouped around <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a> and its affiliated MPs.</p> <p>Brown therefore sought to take the battle to the Conservatives. Did George Osborne really say that in the midst of a financial crisis \"it's a function of financial markets that people make loads of money out of the misery of others\"? Brown quoted the shadow chancellor, and a prime minister has to be hyper-accurate in what he says, so this extraordinary quote from Osborne should be more widely known. Indeed, some media investigation into top Tories and their links to speculators and the bonus-greed that has wreaked havoc is long overdue.</p> <p>Since the end of July Labour has turned in on itself, beginning with the venom against David Miliband after his appeal for Labour to attack the Conservatives in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">Guardian article</a>. It got worse at the TUC when union leaders attacked a Labour government and Brown's policies with a venom that was never brought into play against Cameron.</p> <p>It is 35 years since I first came to a Labour conference as a young delegate. The conference is a bubble moment disconnected from reality. But Brown's speech had a sharper political edge. He was right to mention the threat of the BNP, who may win seats to the European parliament next June on the back of the steady anti-EU culture developed by the Tories and the anti-EU press. As chilly economic winds blow through the labour market, as credit and orders dry up and firms shed jobs to balance their books, it may not be enough to invoke Labour's proud job creation record. Instead we need a thorough analysis of the new immaterial capitalism and what rules are needed to guard it from its self-destructive tendencies. There are specific proposals coming from socialists and Labour MEPs in the European parliament, which Britain should support. Brown could embarrass the Tories by being a leader in Europe: so often Whitehall has led the way in resisting progressive European cooperation.</p> <p>There were name checks for nearly every cabinet and some junior ministers, which suggests the idea of a team working together. But Labour and Brown have to work against a European wide turn-off from centre left and social democratic politics. The long era of relatively benign capitalism is over. Hard working families and hard working individuals \u2013 with a third of Britain in single households, it is odd that they never get a mention \u2013 feel their purchasing power is under threat as never before. To suggest higher taxes, which would further reduce the purchasing power of households, is a one-way ticket to oblivion for Labour.</p> <p>Brown was right to stress Labour's NHS record and the pledge of free check-ups for all over-40s. That should start with MPs going to local hospitals in front of the media to encourage everyone to understand the importance of taking responsibility for their own health.</p> <p>Brown insisted that Labour remained pro-business, and he was right to praise the one million firms that generate our national wealth. If Labour shrinks to its comfort zone as defined by Brown's left critics we will please ourselves with our own rhetoric but leave 75% of the electorate unmoved.</p> <p>Next week we shall see a Tory party of the rich, by the rich, for the rich. The week after, parliament returns from recess and normal politics will resume. If Labour can concentrate our fire on the Tories instead of attacking each other, things might start to get better. They cannot get much worse.</p>",
  "<p>Just how desperate is Sienna Miller for work?

  "<p>Gordon Brown has had a \"charisma bypass\" Tony Blair's stepmother-in-law said today, as she told how the new regime had tried to block her and her husband, the actor Tony Booth, from attending this year's Labour conference.</p> <p>In comments reminiscent of Cherie Booth's conference gaffe two years ago, Steph Booth, poured scorn on the prime minister's perceived lack of personality.</p> <p>\"I'm sure he's a perfectly decent and clever man, but when it comes to charisma, well I think Gordon has had a charisma bypass,\" she said.</p> <p>Eyeing the queue to go into the Manchester conference hall to watch Brown's keynote speech Booth remarked: \"Oh get a life.\"</p> <p>Asked how Brown compared to the former prime minister, her son-in-law Tony Blair, Booth said: \"Tony was always a good speaker. When I see Gordon speak I just feel sorry for him.\"</p> <p>Booth said she recently saw Blair looking relaxed and tanned at his London home in Connaught Square.</p> <p>And she revealed that the former PM had to intervene to help the Booths get conference accreditation.<br> \"We applied to come to conference and it was all going swimmingly until we had to give our names,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Then we kept ringing up about it and they said they would get back to us but they never did. In the end I mentioned to Tony that we weren't going to be able to go because we couldn't get accreditation.</p> <p>\"He couldn't believe it. 'You're joking?' he said. Then he called some people, who called some people and eventually we got our passes, but we only got the ok about 10 days ago.</p> <p>\"Of course, in previous years we were part of the [leader's] family so we never had to queue up and always got a good seat.\"</p> <p>At the same venue just two years ago, Booth's stepdaughter, Cherie Blair, wrecked Brown's carefully calibrated keynote conference address when she was reportedly overheard branding the then chancellor a liar.</p> <p>At the time, Downing Street went into overdrive to deny that Blair's wife had so contemptuously dismissed the chancellor. Ironically, Brown had been using his speech to effect a public reconciliation with the prime minister, saying he regretted their differences. </p> <p>A Labour party spokesman later denied Booth's claim. \"It's complete rubbish,\" he said. \"At no time has conference accreditation [for Tony and Steph Booth] been blocked or delayed.\"</p>",
  "<p>One-third of white Democrats, an <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/page/election-2008-political-pulse-obama-race\">AP-Yahoo News poll</a> has discovered, have a deeply negative view of black Americans. These Democrats believe that we are \"lazy\", \"violent\" and responsible for our own troubles. File under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog_(journalism)\">\"dog bites man\"</a>, you might think. Everyone already knew that more than a few white Americans have serious issues with black Americans.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton broke it down when <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-05-07-clintoninterview_N.htm\">she observed in May</a> - as a reason to support her dying campaign to become the Democratic nominee for president - that Barack Obama's \"support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again.\" She was not only citing her appeal to a significant, perhaps pivotal, group of Democrats but also playing on their sense that blacks are unworthy.</p> <p>Democrats are supposed to have largely moved on from that trying period, which put on display dispiriting race and gender fissures in their party. On this front, the question is whether Obama will win the presidency. And this comes down to whether he will gain enough support from white Democrats, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/09/clinton.supporters/index.html\">17% of whom plan to vote for John McCain and Sarah Palin</a>, who surely must be the worst presidential ticket, in the worst of times for Republicans and the country, in recent memory.</p> <p>But that is not what interests me most here and now. I'm more interested in the AP article that accompanies the poll. The lede states: \"Deep-seated racial misgivings could cost Barack Obama the White House.\" This is puzzling. How could \"racial misgivings\" regarding lazy, violent and irresponsible blacks cost Obama anything? What do these racial misgivings have to do with him - and the millions of other black Americans who do not fit the negative stereotype?</p> <p>I am no Obamatron, but facts are facts. Obama is a well-known figure of national and even global stature at this point. Despite the claim, often echoed sympathetically in the mainstream media, that many whites still don't know enough about him, he has written two autobiographies, served as a US senator since 2005, was an Illinois state senator for seven years before that and is a Harvard Law School graduate.</p> <p>Obama is not lazy, violent or irresponsible. He has to be one of the hardest working, conciliatory and intelligent of public citizens, though he probably is not the transformational politician his fervent supporters take him to be. Shouldn't Clinton's white Democrats love him, their racial misgivings aside? Not if these Democrats are racist - and they are.</p> <p>Read the poll results and the article. Don't blame me, the messenger. I repeat: They are racist white men and white women, who happen to be Democrats. News organisations have a responsibility to call this \"racial misgivings\" phenomenon what it is: racism. Failure to do so fuels the popular notion that the only whites who truly count as racists identify with the Klan or at least utter \"nigger\" routinely.</p> <p>If these white Democrats merely had racial misgivings, this could not cost Obama. He appears to represent the opposite of all they deem true and contemptible about blacks. So we would expect him to be their model of a good black person and their exemplar of what is possible in this country on grounds of merit and charisma - as indeed he is for many of his white supporters.</p> <p>Since Obama obviously is not lazy, violent or irresponsible, the major problem those with racial misgivings have with him must be that he is a person with conspicuous African ancestry, aka a black person. When one cannot overcome one's racial misgivings, even when presented with an individual who does not embody features that are the alleged basis for the misgivings about his group, then one is a racist.</p> <p>The racial misgivings crowd can no longer play the competency card with a straight face. Especially after the last two weeks, no Democrats of right, non-racist mind could believe that Barack Obama and Joe Biden are less competent and less likely to \"bring about the change they want\" than McCain and Palin - no matter that more than a quarter of all Democrats told the AP-Yahoo News pollsters otherwise.</p> <p>As an Ohio Democrat sitting among friends said openly: \"We still don't like black people.\" They understandably do not like us lazy, violent and irresponsible. Nor - as Republican representative Lynn Westmoreland conveyed in flat-out <a href=\"http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html\">calling Obama \"uppity\"</a> - do they like us hard working, law abiding, responsible, intelligent and ambitious. Basically, a significant number of whites, including Democrats, don't like us, period - regardless of our character, talent and achievements as individuals.</p> <p>Maybe Clinton was right that she could capture enough of the white vote and Obama could not. I'm not entirely sure what her observation says about her, but I do know what the very real possibility of its truth continues to say about the United States.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, has promised legislation guaranteeing parents the \"fundamental right\" that their children will leave primary school achieving acceptable standards in reading, writing and arithmetic.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the Labour party conference Brown pledged \"excellence in every school\" and he promise that he and education secretary Ed Balls \"will never excuse, explain away or tolerate low standards in education\". </p> <p>He said that Labour's commitment to fairness \"demands nothing less than excellence in every school, for every child.\"</p> <p>\"So today I guarantee to parents two fundamental rights. Because every child should leave primary school able to read, write and count, any child who falls behind will not be left behind - but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch up tuition.\"</p> <p>And he said that all parents should see their children taught in schools that achieve good results at GCSE. \"Our pledge today is that any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.\"</p> <p>He also promised to \"keep up the pace of reform\" with more academies, trust and specialist schools, \"more of the brightest and best graduates becoming teachers, more investment in building schools for the future - state of the art schools for world class schooling\". </p> <p>And he promised \"groundbreaking\" legislation that would \"enshrine in the law of the land\" Labour's commitment to ending to the elimination of child poverty by 2020.</p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Europe's largest teaching union said that she welcomed the government's plan to extend free nursery places, but \"they need to ensure that qualified teachers with a proper background in child development are brought into nurseries.\"</p> <p>However, the government was wrong to continue to back academies, she said. \"What is needed is a good local school for every child. The emphasis on failed schools sends out the wrong message. The vast majority of schools as we know are doing excellent jobs for our young people. </p> <p>\"Giving personal tuition to children who need it most, while not a new idea, is a bold move. Fairness requires that children from disadvantaged backgrounds should receive the sort of help that children from wealthier backgrounds get.\"</p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that he was concerned about Brown's comments on measures to deal with schools that fall below the government's 30 per cent GCSE target.</p> <p>\"There are many schools in challenging areas, with high deprivation and mobility, that are making excellent progress. To threaten these schools with closure is unfair and does a disservice to the dedicated leaders, teachers and staff working in them.\"</p> <p>\"Schools in these circumstances will not be turned around by threats from the government and they certainly will not be turned around overnight. The leaders of these schools need targeted, sustained support, not increased pressure.\"</p>",

  "<p>The European commission yesterday opened a new front in its war with dominant mobile phone operators by proposing price caps to slash the cost of sending texts, downloading data and making calls overseas.</p> <p>EU telecoms commissioner, Viviane Reding, said: \"We don't want to send operators out of business. Our price ceilings are very generous and no operator will be bankrupt because of these 'roaming' proposals.\"</p> <p>She was responding to fresh complaints from the GSM Association, which represents big players such as Orange and Vodafone, that the EC plans are \"politically motivated regulation\" and \"micro-management\" and will drive down revenues and stifle investment and innovation.</p> <p>Reding accused operators of failing to respond to her offer of a year's grace to cut text and data costs and of continuing to levy excessive charges on consumers.</p> <p>\"We would have no need for micro-management at a political level if the industry had done its management at a commercial level,\" she said, adding that price caps on voice calls imposed since last year had been a zero-sum game, since falling revenue had been offset by increased traffic.</p> <p>Last year, EU citizens sent 2.5 billion SMS worth \u20ac800m at an average cost of \u20ac0.29 a text when travelling within Europe.

Except for in certain areas \u2013 such as videos featuring pornography, graphic violence or hate speech \u2013 the site has adopted a pledge to take down material only after it is flagged as inappropriate by users.</p> <p>This has served as a solid, and necessary, defence under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act in YouTube's long-running legal battle with Viacom, among others, over its responsibilities regarding copyrighted content.</p> <p>However, as the world's largest video website has become an accepted part of mainstream media, it has increasingly come in for criticism for not being proactive about content relating to abuse, violence and suicide. </p> <p>YouTube was taken to task in the UK in July over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/31/internet.youtube\">its policing of the \"dark side\" of the internet</a>, in a culture, media and sport committee report looking at harmful content on the internet.</p> <p>In a press briefing on the topic, the committee chairman, John Whittingdale, cited one specific example of concern, involving a video of what appeared to be a gang rape that had been viewed around 600 times. He said YouTube had been made aware of the content by a user but the video had not been taken down until a second warning came through.<br> Earlier this month, YouTube announced an overhaul of its community guidelines to include a specific ban on videos that incite violence. \"We realise it's not always obvious where we draw the line on content that's acceptable to upload,\" <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/blog?entry=YMavGxHoewU\">YouTube said in a blogpost</a>. </p> <p>In the US, YouTube has come under pressure <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091103447.html\">from the independent senator Joseph Lieberman</a>, who argued that existing policy failed to capture scores of films from terrorist groups disseminating militant propaganda. </p> <p>Last week, Google went further in the UK and Ireland, banning content that glamorises guns and knives in response to concerns over the role of gang videos in fuelling crime. The rule expressly bars YouTube users from \"showing weapons in their videos with the express aim of intimidation\".</p>",
  "<p>People will always debate Kylie. They'll discuss the botox, point out how she will never sing like Beyonc\u00e9 (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/feb/05/artsfeatures.popandrock1\">she coos like Jane Birkin</a>) and stress how she could never dance like Britney or Madonna (she barely moves). But as a pop superstar, Kylie is total and utter genius. Why? Because she's remained relevant for more than 20 years, coming back from the dead more times than most (and more times than Madonna, the most obvious comparison).</p> <p>Her first breakthrough hit I Should Be So Lucky is steeped in post-modern irony. Kylie turned up at Pete Waterman's offices waiting to record a new song and Watermen, having forgotten the appointment, remarked \"Kylie? She should be so lucky\". An hour later, they had recorded a hit that went on to sell millions. Sure, it's dreadful, but, in retrospect, maybe it is so dreadful, it fits into the so-bad-its-genius bracket?</p> <p>Subsequent Kylie albums made with Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman presented a sound so empty and vacuous it represented the decade of Thatcher without a trace of irony. Kylie was the likable pop face of greed; she was cute and wholesome with songs built on pure chorus and commerce. She also retained a vital pop innocence in her videos. </p> <p>The first credible artist to have a rethink of Kylie and SAW was KLF member and cultural raconteur Bill Drummond. Bill got SAW to produce his discoveries Brilliant and aped their own Kylie formula with his 1989 single Kylie Said to Jason, a record written specifically to be a Top 10 hit - it failed, but inspired The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way).</p> <p>Kylie was ubiquitous in the 80s, from appearing in Neighbours and music videos, romancing Jason Donovan or a continual presence on the radio - she was the ultimate pop urchin. But behind the scenes, she was a business woman learning the art of the brand - as she herself stated: \"Learn your lines ... perform your lines, no time for questions, promote the product.\" Her success came with so much ease that it almost seemed like the pop version of Malcolm McLaren's Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle.</p> <p>When SAW's popularity began to wane, Kylie started to control her own image, rebranding herself as Sex Kylie, a stringent feminist who wanted to write and escape the pop ghetto of SAW. It worked. Sort of. What do you do when your music helped define the worse aspects of the previous decade? Obvious. You seek out Nick Cave.</p> <p>Nick Cave and Kylie Minogue made an unholy duo - darkness and light - that gave birth to ironic Kylie. He persuaded her to recite the lyrics to <a href=\"http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I-Should-Be-So-Lucky-lyrics-Kylie-Minogue/268198475487BAFC48256A6300226A4A\">I Should Be So Lucky</a> at the Poetry Olympics at the Royal Albert Hall. Performing a duet with her on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRMe5H9WKpM\">Where the Wild Roses Grow</a>, Cave maintained an obsession with Kylie's projected innocence, beauty and child-like naivety that he'd had since the early days of Pop Kylie. It became obvious nothing was going to stop this pop mutant. The team up was successful and a hit for Kylie. Her next project, Impossible Princess, co-written by Manic Street Preachers and herself, aligned herself as \"Self-realised Kylie\". Self-realised Kylie portrayed herself in a mighty death battle with all the various versions of herself. Sadly, Kylie Minogue lost the battle and Impossible Princess bombed. She was written off again.</p> <p>Kylie rebounded (of course) with the disco-kitsch-and-hot-pants success of Light Years, solidifying her comeback with the storming single Can't Get You Out of My Head. Her subsequent album Fever saw Kylie reinvent herself as a sort of Daft Punk meets <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_X_Performance\">Gina X Performance</a> of the Noughties. And she changed again with Body Language, confirming her success at the pop game. She altered the videos this time - instead of sex and innocence, the videos that accompanied these songs were reminiscent of Devo's satirical pastiches. It was textbook comeback material. </p> <p>X might have recorded disappointing sales and accolades but she'll bounce back. Kylie is a stomping Godzilla of pop culture. Who else can say they mashed up New Order's Blue Monday (with Can't Get You Out of My Head), performed with Fischerspooner and Kermit the Frog, and got covered by Flaming Lips and Tricky (both times they pleaded for Kylie to be \"understood\")? Who else has tallied up 30 Top 10 UK hits, won an OBE and still have time to be considered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jun/04/kylieminogue.popandrock\">\"too sexy\" by Coldplay</a>? The Kylie brand is omnipotent. She's a postmodern, feminist, countercultural and mainstream hero. Everyone loves her. Why fight it?</p>",

  "<p><strong>Why Katine?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/video/2007/oct/20/alan.rusbridger.introduction\">Katine</a>, in Soroti county, is one of Uganda's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/welcome\">poorest regions</a>, where the majority of residents live on just 50p a day. It has little electrical power, the water is unsafe and life is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/21/about\">daily struggle</a> for most residents. It has typical characteristics of underdeveloped regions in rural Africa, but also the potential for improvement. Amref's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/apr/10/katineamref.background\">baseline survey</a> showed that the population of Katine suffer worse health and living conditions than elsewhere in rural Uganda. There is a huge gap between the extreme poverty faced by the local community and the lack of services provided by the government, which is especially marked in a rural setting such as Katine.</p> <p><strong>What do you want the project to achieve?</strong></p> <p>The aim of the project is to improve residents' access to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/water\">water</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/health\">healthcare</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/education\">education</a>, as well as improve <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/livelihoods\">livelihoods</a> and empower locals to take charge of their lives through better <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/governance\">governance</a>.</p> <p><strong>What have you achieved so far?</strong></p> <p>The single biggest achievement in the project to date has been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/12/education.projectgoals\">building of the Amorikot primary school</a>, which opened for the new term last week. The mud and wattle huts in which pupils were taught have now been replaced with seven permanent classrooms. There are also staff offices and modern latrines. Amref has also begun <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jan/22/water.development\">drilling water boreholes</a> in the sub-country and protecting existing ones. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/12/governance.water\">Village Health Teams</a> have received training to monitor the health of their local communities and offer basic medical assistance. Members of the team have been given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/mar/28/health.projectgoals\">bicycles</a> to help them get around the villages. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jun/17/health.projectgoals\">Anti-malaria bed nets</a> have also been distributed to pregnant women and children. And farmers have been trained in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/aug/29/livelihoods.projectgoals\">growing cassava</a>. These are some of the highlights of the past year, but, of course, there is still a long way to go.<br> <strong>How will the project be sustainable beyond three years?</strong></p> <p>Our partner <a href=\"http://www.amrefuk.org\">Amref</a> has been working to alleviate poverty in north-east Uganda for many years. The organisation will be working closely with local leaders on all its work in Katine to ensure it continues when Amref leaves. What Amref hopes to achieve from this project is not an isolated case of improvements in a few people's lives, but rather a model of good practice that can be scaled up and replicated across Uganda by the government, private sector, international development agencies and bilateral partners. For more on Amref's approach, read our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/may/06/background.katineamref\">interview</a> with Amref UK chief executive Jo Ensor.</p> <p><strong>How can the project be successful in isolation (how widely will the benefits be felt)?</strong></p> <p>Katine has a population of more than 25,000 people, so the project will be reaching a large number of people. Improvements to certain facilities in Katine such as Tiriri Health Centre, which reaches 130,000 people, serving six neighbouring sub-counties, will enhance access to healthcare beyond Katine. As the project in Katine develops and matures, Amref is looking to generate evidence of how positive change can come about and visible changes in Katine through strong community participation in local government planning will mean that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/feb/06/debatewhatwilltheneighbour\">neighbours</a> will see how they too can learn and adopt this approach. Amref believes the project will provide a model of good practice that can be replicated across Uganda by the government and local community leaders.</p> <p><strong>Isn't this a huge amount of money for one project, compared with other aid projects, especially on a per capita basis?</strong></p> <p>You can read Amref's budget in full <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/mar/11/background.katinepartners\">here</a>. It is more money than some other aid projects, but the money will not be handed out at once. Amref needs to ensure that there are sufficient funds to ensure the work done over the three years continues and the community has adequate resources to become self-sufficient.</p> <p><strong>Hasn't area-based development been tried many times before and failed?</strong></p> <p>A criticism of area-based projects is that they have not been fully owned by the communities in which they are based or by governments, and that \"exit\" strategies have not been well planned. This is something we are very conscious of, which is why we have asked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/amref.about\">Rick Davies</a> to monitor the project's progress, as an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2008/jan/11/assessingthekatineproject\">independent observer</a>, to ensure the work achieved over the next three years can continue successfully. Rick has already completed his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/mar/26/katineamref.katinepartners\">first assessment</a>, and Amref believes its close connections with local and national leaders will help bring about lasting change.</p> <p><strong>Will the presence of the media distort or adversely affect the project?</strong></p> <p>A media presence will always have an affect on a community, especially short visits from overseas press. But it doesn't have to be negative. To avoid reporting with a \"Western eye\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardmkavuma\">Richard M Kavuma</a>, a journalist at the <a href=\"http://www.observer.ug/\">Weekly Observer</a> in Kampala will be visiting the village for two weeks every month to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardmkavuma\">report on progress</a>. We hope his regular visits will mean villagers become used to his presence.</p> <p><strong>What's in it for Barclays?</strong></p> <p>Barclays has given \u00a3500,000 to Amref as an upfront payment to get the project underway and will pay a further \u00a31m over the life of the project to match readers' donations. The bank wants to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/feb/07/background.projectgoals\">support local financial initiatives</a> \u2013 such as savings clubs or co-ops \u2013 and improve financial knowledge among villagers.</p> <p><strong>What is the security situation in the sub-county?</strong></p> <p>After the country declared independence in 1962, a quarter of a century of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/oct/20/agriculture.governance\">political tumult and violence</a> followed. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/lra\">Lord's Resistance Army</a> has been waging a war in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/feb/19/background\">north of Uganda</a> for the past 20 years, seeking to depose the government. A few years ago the rebel group ransacked villages throughout Soroti, including Katine. In 2006, the LRA and the government declared a ceasefire and peace talks resumed recently, although no deal has been struck. You can read more on Uganda's politics and history <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/politicsandhistory\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>How can I get involved practically?</strong></p> <p>Amref will always consider offers of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/katineblog/2007/nov/22/therightkindofhelp\">practical help</a>, but people in Katine need the expertise of those with the relevant experience and skills. You may find that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/donate\">donating to the project</a> to help the experts will do more to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jan/17/about\">help</a>.</p> <p><strong>I am a teacher and my pupils would like to raise funds for children in Katine. What can I do?</strong></p> <p>We have launched a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/schools\">schools resources</a> section, which contains a downloadable fundraising pack, as well as Katine-themed lessons plans which fit the National Curriculum, links and videos.</p> <p><strong>How will villagers be empowered to make their own decisions and represent themselves at a local government level?</strong></p> <p>Many small rural communities currently lack the ability to represent themselves to government, even at a local level. Amref will be working to help <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/video/2007/oct/20/governance\">empower communities</a> to take their politicians to task for its failure to deliver basic rights to water, healthcare and education. Amref is working with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2007/dec/15/development\">local committees</a> to give villagers a greater say in shaping their future.</p> <p><strong>What will the Guardian's commitment be if the project appears to be failing?</strong></p> <p>The Guardian has committed to track Amref's project in Katine for the duration of its three years. Through regular assessments of the work from our independent monitor and all our partners, we hope to identify any problems early on, so that Amref can solve them before they escalate. Rick is even commenting on his work for us on <a href=\"http://mandenews.blogspot.com\">his own blog</a>.</p> <p><strong>Can the project really help women?</strong></p> <p>We hope so. Two of our goals are to improve <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/education\">education</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/health\">healthcare</a>. The UN has said that educating girls means improved life chances \u2013 financially and medically \u2013 not just for them, but for their families and communities.</p> <p><strong>How do I navigate around the website?</strong></p> <p>Our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/background\">background</a> section offers you information on the project, its aims and our partners.

  "<p>One school massacre might be blamed on an unfortunate young loner and poor gun control. Two, in less than a year, at least raises the question of whether there is something about Finland's culture which might explain such tragedies. </p> <p>When Times correspondent Robert Boyes dared to suggest this in the wake of Finland's 2007 Jokela high school shooting, hundreds of Finns registered their fury at the alleged \"insensitivity\" and \"stereotyping\" in his article. It is vital to tread carefully when trying to understand a culture and particularly one that various experts have claimed is a \"shame culture\" \u2013 one that is acutely sensitive to the perceptions of outsiders.</p> <p>Stereotypically, Finland is either portrayed as a forest-paradise or a dark wilderness teaming with alcoholic suicides. Both portrayals are absurd. But what is statistically true is that Finnish men are relatively violent.</p> <p>According to Finnish sociologist Johanna Kantola, Finland has the highest level of domestic violence in western Europe with 40% of women having experienced violence at the hands of men. A historian of Finland, Anthony Upton, concurs that even in the 19th century \"Finland was understood to be two to three times more violent than Western European countries\".<br> The notorious Finnish suicide problem \u2013 a form of violence \u2013 is primarily a male phenomenon. In 2003, suicide accounted, according to the World Health Organisation, for 21 deaths per 100,000. It was 31.9 suicides per 100,000 deaths in men, 9.8 among women. In Norway the average was 12.6 suicides per 100,000 deaths in men and women.</p> <p>Many Finns are inclined to blame this \"violence\" on the way in which Finnish men \"cannot express their emotions\".</p> <p>\"We cannot express our feelings,\" claimed a teacher from Helsinki. \"If a man talks a lot he is seen as effeminate... To be a Finn is to be very male... you're not allowed to talk about your problems.</p> <p>\"It's like we haven't got the tools to solve our problems with words but we are passionate deep inside and sometimes this comes out.\"</p> <p>A pensioner from southern Finland felt that the violence was \"to do with hidden aggression in Finnish men\". For a security guard from the north: \"Finnish men have this violent, passionate side that they're keeping down all the time\". A Helsinki beautician described Finnish men as \"very jealous... with no self-confidence.\" </p> <p>And many Finns commented that wanting to be \"alone\" is more socially acceptable in Finland, meaning that lonely people are often assumed to wish to be so.</p> <p>For Finland-expert Tarja Laine this \"low self-confidence\" is due to \"national low self-esteem\" connected to Finland's rule by Sweden, then Russia and then its heavy compliance with the Soviets, as well as the influence of pietist religious groups.</p> <p>Paradoxically, there is also research indicating that Finland is particularly influenced by American culture and has very high gun ownership.</p> <p>But being unemotional and tough was an important play for status and education has been another crucial way of gaining national self-esteem. <a href=\"http://www.visitfinland.com/\">VisitFinland.com</a> declares that Finland is \"the most educated country in the world\".</p> <p>Many researchers in Finland agree that education is crucially important to your place in Finnish society, putting young people under intense pressure and especially men (as women are becoming more educated than men). University is very hard to get into with some students trying four times before giving up and maybe studying abroad.<br> About a third of teenagers \u2013 not suited for \"academic high school\" \u2013 go to \"vocational school\"; the kind of school where the Kauhajoki massacre occurred. They are popularly derided as \"amis\" \u2013 a term vaguely comparable to \"chav\" \u2013 which implies low education and garish consumption choices.</p> <p>There are many reasons why two school massacres have occurred in Finland in two years but it should at least make us wonder if there is something in Finnish culture that might help to explain them. </p> <p>For some Finns, any unpalatable assessment of their supposedly \"unique culture\", especially by a foreigner, is always \"stereotyping\" and \"biased\". But many Finns that I have interviewed seem to think deeply about their small country and really want to make sense of the forest paradise's less comfortable side.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr Edward Dutton is currently researching a book on Finnish culture and religion.

  "<h2>On his private life</h2> <p>Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple. My children aren't props, they're people.</p> <h2>On his personality</h2> <p>If people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about. I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country.</p> <h2>On his mistakes</h2> <p>Where I've made mistakes, I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes.</p> <h2>On business</h2> <p>We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government.</p> <h2>On the economy</h2> <p>We do all it takes to stabilise the still-turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles.</p> <h2>On climate change</h2> <p>To end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal. And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050, not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut.</p> <h2>On public services</h2> <p>We must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each.</p> <h2>On early years education</h2> <p>We will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two-year-olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country, backed by high-quality, affordable childcare for all.</p> <h2>Ending child poverty</h2> <p>I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.</p> <h2>On education</h2> <p>Any child who falls behind will not be left behind, but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch-up tuition ... Any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.</p> <h2>On the digital age</h2> <p>We will fund over a million extra families to get online.</p> <h2>On the NHS</h2> <p>Labour is the party of the NHS. We created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it ... In April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check-ups for everyone over 40.</p> <h2>Still on health</h2> <p>For those in our nation battling cancer, from next year you will not pay prescription charges.</p> <p>As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget, we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions.</p> <h2>On pensions</h2> <p>We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.</p> <h2>On social care</h2> <p>Alan Johnson [the health secretary] and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.</p> <h2>On benefits</h2> <p>Everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell [the work and pensions secretary] has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it.</p> <h2>On crime</h2> <p>Taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent ... In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families, the people the courts and police exist to serve.</p> <h2>On immigration</h2> <p>We recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test, and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services.</p> <h2>On the Tories</h2> <p>Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs: no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under. What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.</p> <p>Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.</p> <p>The Conservatives say our country is broken, but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists.</p> <h2>On international relations</h2> <p>We will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran ... and David Miliband [the foreign secretary], Douglas Alexander [the international development secretary] and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.</p> <h2>On global poverty</h2> <p>This Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation.</p> <h2>On Labour party woes</h2> <p>Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community. Because this job is not about me, it's about you.</p> <p>Tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve.</p>",

It began shortly before 11am, when around 200 people were in the building.</p> <p>\"A cold-blooded shooter entered the building with an automatic pistol and started cutting down students,\" Jukka Forsberg, a maintenance man at the school, said.</p> <p>\"He also shot towards me, did not say anything ... once the bullets started to whizz by, I started running for my life.\"</p> <p>According to reports, the gunman was carrying an automatic weapon and wearing a ski mask as he entered the school.</p> <p>\"Within a short space of time, I heard several dozen rounds of shots - in other words, it was an automatic pistol,\" Forsberg told the broadcaster YLE.</p> <p>\"I saw some female students who were wailing and moaning, and one managed to escape out of the back door.\"</p> <p>Timo Huovinen, a local journalist, told Sky News that students had been about to begin an exam when the gunman opened fire.</p> <p>It is almost a year since nine people, including the gunman, died in a school shooting in the town of Tuusala, near Helsinki.</p> <p>Pekka-Eric Auvinen killed six students, the school nurse and the principal before shooting himself at the Jokela high school last November.</p> <p>Finland has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world after the US and Yemen, according to the Geneva-based Graduate Institute of International Studies.</p>",

  "<p>I want to talk with you today about who I am, what I believe, what I am determined to lead this party and this great country to achieve.</p> <p>As we gather here today I know people have real concerns about the future of the country, the future of the economy and people in this hall have concerns about the future of our party too.</p> <p>And so I want to answer your questions directly, to talk with you about how amidst all the present difficulties we should be more confident than ever that we can build what I want to talk to you about today. A new settlement for new times. A fair Britain for the new age. </p> <p>But let me start with something I hope you know already. </p> <p>I didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular. Perhaps, that's just as well. No, 25 years ago I asked the people of Fife to send me to parliament to serve the country I love. </p> <p>And I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted and want to change it. </p> <p>So I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.</p> <p>And if people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about - I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country. </p> <p>What angers me and inspires me to act is when people are treated unfairly.</p> <p>So when people share with me stories about the hard time they're having with bills, I want to help, because I was brought up seeing my parents having to juggle their budget like the rest of us. </p> <p>And when I talk to parents about schools, I'm determined that every child should have a good school, because while I got my break in a great local secondary, not all my friends got the chance to get on.</p> <p>And when I speak to victims of crime I get angry - because like them I know the difference between right and wrong. </p> <p>And so here I am - working for this incredible country, while trying as far as possible to give my children an ordinary childhood. Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple. My children aren't props; they're people.</p> <p>And where I've made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes - because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be. </p> <p>And so I want to give the people of this country an unconditional assurance - no ifs, no buts, no small print - my unwavering focus is taking this country through the challenging economic circumstances we face and building the fair society of the future. </p> <p>The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country. </p> <p>The people of Britain would never forget if we failed to put them first - and friends, they'd be right. </p> <p>And because this is a time of greater than ever change around us, it must be a time of higher ambition from us. And because the world of 2008 is now so different from the world of 1997 I want to talk about the new settlement we must build for these new times. </p> <p>You know, each generation believes it is living through changes their parents could never have imagined - but the collapse of banks, the credit crunch, the trebling of oil prices, the speed of technology, and the rise of Asia - nobody now can be in any doubt that we are in a different world and it's now a global age. </p> <p>In truth, we haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution. This last week will be studied by our children - as the week the world was spun on its axis - and old certainties were turned on their heads. </p> <p>And in these uncertain times, we must be, we will be, the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand. </p> <p>And friends, it's a calling that summons us because in every time of profound change those with great wealth and privilege have always been able to look after themselves. </p> <p>But our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most- Britain's vast majority - people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amidst this change - we are on their side. </p> <p>Where there are new risks and new pressures our duty is and will be security for all. And where there are new opportunities, our duty is and will be fair chances for everyone matched by fair rules applied to everyone. </p> <p>And insuring people against the new risks and empowering people with new opportunities is the mission of the hour. And those who say that governments should walk away when people face these risks and need these opportunities will be judged to be on the wrong side of history. </p> <p>And when the country is asking their government to meet these new challenges I say to our opponents: those who don't believe in the potential of government shouldn't be trusted to form one.</p> <p>So this is a defining moment for us - a test not just of our judgment but of our values. Today once again we are called to apply our enduring beliefs to completely new conditions.</p> <p>New Labour has always been at its best when we have applied our values to changing times. In the 1990s Tony and I asked you to change policy to meet new challenges.</p> <p>We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government. And we believe the dynamism of our five million businesses large and small is vital to the success of our country. </p> <p>But the continuing market turbulence shows why we now need a new settlement for these times - a settlement that we as a pro-market party must pursue. </p> <p>A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise. </p> <p>A settlement where both markets and government are seen to be the servants of the people, and never their masters,</p> <p>Where what counts is not the pursuit of any sectional interest but the advancement of the public interest - and where at all times we put people first.</p> <p>Let us be clear the modern role of government is not to provide everything, but it must be to enable everyone.</p> <p>And just as we know that governments cannot and should not do everything, so too we know markets cannot deliver it all on their own.</p> <p>And just as those who supported the dogma of big government were proved wrong, so too those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong. <br> And so it falls to this party and to this government, with its commitment both to fairness and to business, to propose and deliver what after recent events everyone should now be willing to accept - that we do all it takes to stabilise the still turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles. And friends the work begins tomorrow. </p> <p>I and then Alistair will meet financial and government leaders in New York to make these proposals:</p> <p>First, transparency - all transactions need to be transparent and not hidden.</p> <p>Second, sound banking, a requirement to demonstrate that risks can be managed and priced for bad times as well as good.</p> <p>Third, responsibility - no member of a bank's board should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from them. </p> <p>Fourth, integrity - removing conflicts of interest so that bonuses should not be based on short term speculative deals but on hard work, effort and enterprise. </p> <p>I know that the British people think it's hard work, effort and enterprise we need to reward. <br> </p> <p>And fifth, global standards and supervision because the flows of capital are global, then supervision can no longer just be national but has to be global. </p> <p>And if we make these changes I believe London will retain its rightful place as the financial centre of the world. </p> <p>And we know that the challenges we face in this new global age didn't begin in the last week, or in the last months, but in fact reflect deeper changes in our world. For all its benefits, the global age has revealed not just financial instability but another major pressure - a rising global population demanding more energy.</p> <p>So the new settlement also requires another great and historic endeavour to end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal.</p> <p>And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050 not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut - and I want British companies and British workers to seize the opportunity and lead the world in the transformation to a low carbon economy and I believe that we can create in modern green manufacturing and service one million new jobs.</p> <p>And it's not just our duty but our basic philosophy that we do everything we can to help families through the world downturn. And while the Conservatives did nothing to help people with their gas and electricity bills in the last world downturn, this winter, millions of people will receive the help with heating bills, insulation, social tariffs - help they never received from the Conservatives.</p> <p>But you know, when it comes to public spending you can't just wave a magic wand to conjure up the money - not even with help from Harry Potter. </p> <p>And so there are tough choices and I have to say that as a result of the events of recent weeks there are going to be tougher choices we will have to make and priorities we will have to choose. And just as families have to make economies to make ends meet, so this government must and will ensure that we get value for money out of every single pound of your money that is spent. But I say to you that we will invest it wisely, continuing our record investment in schools, Sure Start centres, transport and hospitals.</p> <p>And if we make the right decisions to take people through the world downturn fairly we will find that, despite the current troubles, British firms and British workers can reap the rewards of a world economy set to double in size. </p> <p>With Britain's great assets - our stability, our openness, our scientific genius, our creative industries, and yes our English language - I know that this can be a British century and I'm determined it will be.</p> <p>But my argument today is that the new settlement for the global age must do even more to empower people with new opportunities insure people against new risks and as a result value hard work effort and enterprise. It's the economy that's been making the headlines, but there are other big changes too.</p> <p>People feel their communities are changing before their eyes and it's increasing their anxiety about crime and anti-social behaviour. And so we will be the party of law and order. </p> <p>And for the first time ever we've got more British pensioners than British children - more people living longer on fixed incomes and worried about whether they'll need long term care. And so we will be the party that will ensure security and dignity for pensioners. </p> <p>And there are new pressures on parents - worrying about balancing work and family life but also about advertising aimed straight at their children and what their children are watching or downloading from the internet. And so we will be the party of the family.</p> <p>And so the new settlement for our times show how Britain can meet all these challenges too and its more than about a fair prosperity - it must be about fair chances and fair rules too. </p> <p>You know some people say that there's an inevitable political cycle in this country - as sure as night follows day. I don't agree. The challenge of these new times demands a truly progressive government to help people cope with the new risks and make the most of the new opportunities. That's why I believe that now more than ever - even more than in 1997- this country needs a Labour government. </p> <p>You know to govern is to choose - and it's what a government chooses to do when it's tested that demonstrates its priorities and reveals its heart. </p> <p>It is not the arithmetic of statistics but the fabric of people's lives.</p> <p>When we talk about three million more people in work since 1997 - that's not just a number, that's a life that's been changed - three million times over. That's the young woman laid off in the mid 90's who's now built a booming business of her own. Three million new jobs not by accident, but by our actions. And in the years to come we will demonstrate again that real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about the one million small and medium-sized businesses set up in the last eleven years, that's not just a number - that's the entrepreneur who can treat her parents to a summer holiday, and the local businessman who's taken on two local teenagers as apprentices. One million new businesses demonstrating yet again the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about one million people benefiting from new Labour's minimum wage that's not just a number - that's a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child and it's a mum who doesn't have to go to a loan shark to pay for her kids' Christmas. One million people freed from exploitation- and now the minimum wage rising year on year - that's the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And when we talk about the 240,000 lives that are saved by the progress Labour's NHS has made in fighting cancer and heart disease, that's not just a number - that's the dad who lives to walk his daughter up the aisle and the gran who is there to clap and cry at her grandson's graduation. 240,000 families still together - and now thousands more with new and better treatments from an expanding NHS -- we're changing the world the only way it can ever really change - one life, one family, one hope at a time. That's the real power of Labour to change lives.</p> <p>And why do we always strive for fairness?</p> <p>Not because it makes good soundbites.</p> <p>Not because it gives good photo opportunities.</p> <p>Not because it makes for good P.R.</p> <p>No. </p> <p>We do it because fairness is in our DNA.</p> <p>It's who we are - and what we're for.</p> <p>It's why Labour exists.</p> <p>It's our first instinct, the soul of our party.</p> <p>It's why when things get tough, we get tougher. We stand up, we fight hard - for fairness. We don't give in, and we never will.</p> <p>For me fairness is treating others how we would be treated ourselves. So it isn't levelling down but empowering people to aspire and reach ever higher. And to take advantage of all the opportunities of the global economy I want to unleash a new wave of rising social mobility across our country. </p> <p>For too long we've developed only some of the talents of some people - but the modern route to social mobility is developing all the talents of all the people....helping those who are working their way up from very little and lifting up those in the middle who want to get on. It means supporting what really matters - hard work and effort and enterprise. This is not just the new economic necessity, it is the modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy and will expand. </p> <p>And fairness is why Harriet is introducing the first ever equalities bill. And let me thank her for her tireless work as deputy party leader. </p> <p>Fairness is why Ed Miliband is ensuring that community and third sector organisations can play their proper part in every neighbourhood.</p> <p>And it is why our whole party is leading the fight against the British National Party. </p> <p>Fairness is why John Denham is extending university access, why Ruth Kelly has introduced for the first time free bus travel for pensioners and why John Hutton and our Labour Members of the European Parliament but are fighting to free agency workers from the scourge of exploitation. </p> <p>But fairness for the future also means a big change that I want to explain today. We have always stood for public services that are universal, available to all. Now we must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each. </p> <p>For me, the fairer future starts with putting children first - with the biggest investment in children this country has ever seen. It means delivering the best possible start in life with services tailored to the needs of every single precious child.</p> <p>In 1997 there were no Sure Start centres and nursery education for only the few. Today, thanks to the work of Beverley Hughes there are children's centres opening in every community to serve 3 million children who a few years ago had nothing, and free nursery education for every three and four year old.</p> <p>But our ambitions must be greater still. I want Britain to take its place among the leading nations in pre-school services, and so I pledge here today in Manchester starting in over 30 communities, and then over 60, we will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two year olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country backed by high quality, affordable childcare for all.</p> <p>That's the fairness parents want - and that's the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.</p> <p>And because child poverty demeans Britain, we have committed our party to tackle and to end it. The measures we have taken this year alone will help lift two hundred and fifty thousand children out of poverty. The economic times are tough of course that makes things harder- but we are in this for the long haul - the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. And so today I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.</p> <p>And Ed Balls and I will never excuse, explain away or tolerate low standards in education. So we will keep up the pace of reform: more academies, trust and specialist schools, more of the brightest and best graduates becoming teachers, more investment in building schools for the future - state of the art schools for world class schooling.</p> <p>Fairness demands nothing less than excellence in every school, for every child. So today I guarantee to parents two fundamental rights:</p> <p>Because every child should leave primary school able to read, write and count, any child who falls behind will not be left behind - but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch up tuition.</p> <p>And because all parents should see their children taught in schools which achieve good results at GCSE, our pledge today is that any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.</p> <p>And we want to enable all families to use the internet to link back to their children's school - and so Jim Knight is announcing that we will fund over a million extra families to get online, on the way to our ambition of Britain leading the world with more of our people than any other major economy able to access the internet and broadband.</p> <p>And now as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS let me on behalf of all of us here, and all the people of the country - thank all the NHS staff - the cooks and cleaners, the paramedics and porters, the doctors and midwives and nurses.<br>You have served our country and served a great ideal - the principle that in a fair society health-care should not be a commodity to be bought by some but a right to be enjoyed by all. </p> <p>Labour is the party of the NHS - we created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it. </p> <p>And you know already that for me, this isn't a political agenda but a personal mission. Last year in Bournemouth I told you how when I was 16, I got injured playing rugby and lost the sight forever in my left eye. I knew I couldn't play football or rugby anymore. But I could still read. </p> <p>But what I didn't tell you last year was that then one morning I woke up and realised my sight was going in my good eye. I had another operation and lay in the darkness for days on end. At that point my future was books on tape. </p> <p>But thanks to the NHS, my sight was saved by care my parents could never have afforded. And so it's precisely because I know and have heard from others about the miraculous difference a great surgeon and great nurses and great care can make that I'm so passionate about the values of the NHS and so committed to reforming it to serve these values even better.</p> <p>That's why in just one year in the fight against hospital infections, we have doubled the number of matrons and achieved a 36 percent reduction in MRSA.<br>And let us remember what a Labour government has now achieved: the lowest ever waiting times in the whole history of the NHS. <br>And now to respond to new times and higher aspirations we want to make the National Health Service more personal to people's needs - patients more involved in their own health care with more choice and more control than ever before. </p> <p>And I've always found it unfair that we cannot offer on the NHS the comprehensive services that private patients can afford to buy. And so in April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check ups for everyone over 40.</p> <p>And I say that there is no vested interest, no matter how powerful, that we are not prepared to take on when change is needed for the sake of the nation's health.<br>We have already made it easier for busy families to go to the doctor. Whilst a year ago only 1 in 10 patients had access to GPs at weekends and in the evening. Now almost half of all practices are open and by the end of next year the majority will be open even longer. </p> <p>And today I want to show how this government will pursue what I believe to be one of the noblest and boldest contributions of this country to our shared human fortunes.</p> <p>Since the war nearly one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have been for our genius in medicine. We should now aspire to stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and human health ever further. </p> <p>I want Britain to lead the world in beating the diseases which cause so much heartbreak for families. Over the last few years we've made major breakthroughs in research relevant to cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and strokes and many more. </p> <p>But these are yet to be turned into treatments from, which we can all benefit from. And so let me tell you today that the unprecedented 15 billion pounds we are investing in medical research will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients.</p> <p>Over the next decade we can lead the way in beating cancer and other diseases - a great endeavour worthy of a great country: proud because we have a health service focused on 21st century needs. </p> <p>A NHS that is available to all and personal to each means meeting another challenge of the future: offering, for the first time, every patient with a long term condition their own care plan. <br>But alongside new patient responsibilities will be new rights. And because we know that almost every British family has been touched by cancer, Alan Johnson and I know we must do more to relieve the financial worry that so often goes alongside the heartache. And so I can announce today for those in our nation battling cancer from next year you will not pay prescription charges. </p> <p>And this is not the limit of our commitment to a fair NHS in a fair society. As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions. That's the fairness patients want and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.</p> <p>And in a fair society the fact that older people are living longer should be a blessing for their families not a burden. We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.<br>And I am proud that we will now be implementing for the first time equality for women in their retirement.</p> <p>No-one should live in fear of their old age because they worry their social care will impose financial burdens they could never afford to face and that the minute they need care puts the family home at risk. </p> <p>The generation that rebuilt Britain from the ashes of the war deserves better and so I can tell you today that Alan Johnson and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.<br>That's the fairness older people deserve - and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for. </p> <p>So when people say in these tough times there's nothing we can do, there's nothing higher to aim for, no great causes left worth fighting for, my reply is our ideas are the ideas that will realise the hopes of families for a better future. Providing free nursery care for more children who need it is a cause worth fighting for. </p> <p>Providing better social care for older people who need it is a cause worth fighting for. Delivering excellence in every single school is a cause worth fighting for. Universal check-ups and new help to fight cancer - these are all causes worth fighting for. This is the future we're fighting for.</p> <p>And in this world of vast economic and social change, new opportunity for all must be matched with a new responsibility from all. Our aim is a something for something, nothing for nothing Britain. A Britain of fair chances for all, and fair rules applied to all.</p> <p>So our policy is that everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness, the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it. That's only fair to the people pulling their weight. </p> <p>And let me be clear about the new Labour policy on crime; taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw are introducing a landmark reform in our justice system - to put victims first. In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families - the people the courts and police exist to serve. And Damilola Taylor's father Richard is with is here today. </p> <p>He's an inspiring example of the determination to see some good come out of personal tragedy. Last weekend he led thousands on a march through our capital, sending a united message. We will take the knives off our streets.</p> <p>And justice seen is justice done - so you will be seeing more neighbourhood policing on the street, hearing more about the verdicts of the court, able to see the people who offended doing community payback which will be what it says; hard work for the public benefit at the places and times the public can see it. That's only fair to the law abiding majority.</p> <p>Nobody in Britain should get to take more out of the system than they are willing to put in. I am proud that Britain will honour our obligations to provide refuge from persecution. And we recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services. </p> <p>That's only fair to the public who play by the rules and to the new citizens who uphold the rules.</p> <p>So across the board, we will create rules that reward those who play by them and punish those who don't. That's what fairness means to me.</p> <p>You know our party so often in its history has been home to the big ideas - ideas later taken for granted, but revolutionary in their time. Just think, the vote for working men, and then for women, the NHS, legal protection from race or sex discrimination. These are no longer just Labour policies, they are established British values - they are the common sense of our age.</p> <p>And we should never forget one thing - that every single blow we have struck for fairness and for the future has been opposed by the Conservatives. </p> <p>And just think where our country would be if we'd listened to them. No paternity leave, no New Deal, no bank of England independence, no Sure Start, no devolution, no civil partnerships, no minimum wage, no new investment in the NHS, no new nurses, no new police, no new schools.</p> <p>And so let's hear no more from the Conservatives - we did fix the roof while the sun was shining.</p> <p>And just think if we'd taken their advice on the global financial crisis. Their policy was to let northern rock fold and imperil the whole financial system, our Labour government saved northern rock so not a single UK depositor lost out. </p> <p>Their policy said, in this week of all weeks, that speculative short selling should continue. We acted decisively to end reckless speculation. </p> <p>And the conservative policy would mean that at this very moment, there would be no regulation at all to protect homeowners. We are the party of protecting of homeowners rights. </p> <p>Do you know what their Shadow Chancellor really said? In the week that banks were collapsing the man who wants to run our economy not only said: this is not a problem caused by the financial markets but went on to say and, I quote, \"that it's a function of financial markets that people make loads of money out of the misery of others.\"</p> <p>Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs - no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under. </p> <p>What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.</p> <p>Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.</p> <p>But I believe in giving credit where it's due. The Conservative leader's team are smart - they've got a plan, and they are implementing it ruthlessly. </p> <p>Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.<br>And when salesmen won't tell you what they are selling, it's because they are selling something no-one should buy.</p> <p>But I'm a man for detail and I've discovered some clues about what would be in store in a Conservative Britain. </p> <p>They want us to believe that, like us, they now care about public services. But when Mr Cameron actually talks to his party about their spending plans he says the difference between Labour and Tory levels of public investment will be \"dramatic\" and \"fundamental\". </p> <p>They want to tell us we're all progressives now but the day that Hazel Blears and Caroline Flint were announcing a one billion pound package to support millions of homeowners, the Conservatives were confirming that their first tax priority is to take that one billion pounds from hard working families and hand it over to the 3,000 richest estates in Britain.</p> <p>And they want to tell us they now believe in investing in education, but they are committed to slashing 4.5 billion from the schools building programme, axing the educational maintenance allowances that help poorer students stay on and opposing the raising the education leaving age to eighteen and stopping training programmes. And yes friends, they would even take away Sure Start from infants and their parents. One of our greatest gifts to the future - one of the first priorities for Tory cuts.</p> <p>The Conservatives may want to represent the future, but whether its Europe or energy, planning or tax credits, university places or 42 days, whenever they are tested on substance they have nothing to offer to meet the big challenges of tomorrow, because they are prisoners of their past.</p> <p>If you look beneath the surface, you'll see that the Conservatives might have changed their tune, but they haven't changed their minds. </p> <p>The Conservatives say our country is broken - but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists. </p> <p>Of course there are problems, but this is a country being lifted up every day by the people who love it. </p> <p>We've got 4 million people helping neighbourhood watch, 6 million sports volunteers and over 5 million people doing amazing work as carers.</p> <p>And just as we celebrated our national triumph when we won the 2012 games for London, so too were Andy Burnham, Tessa Jowell and I, along with all of you, filled with pride this summer as our Olympic and Paralympics heroes showed British brilliance at its best. </p> <p>That's why for all the challenges, I don't believe Britain is broken - I think it's the best country in the world. I believe in Britain. </p> <p>And stronger together as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland we can make our United Kingdom even better.</p> <p>And ours is a country full of heroes.</p> <p>And we pay special tribute to the heroism of our armed forces, as Des Browne said yesterday - to their service and sacrifice in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in peacekeeping missions around the globe. Quite simply the best armed forces in the world.</p> <p>The whole lesson of the new world I described earlier is that we must work together to meet the great shared challenges vital to our future.</p> <p>And unlike the Conservatives who are extremists and isolationists on Europe, we will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran. <br>And I tell you that what we do together for the poor and vulnerable is an act of compassion, but it is more than that. It is what will determine whether this new global society succeeds or fails.<br>And David Miliband, Douglas Alexander and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy, to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.</p> <p>And I promise you I will work with other countries to bring a permanent settlement - a secure Israel and a viable Palestine - to deliver peace for the people of the Middle East. </p> <p>And this week at Britain's request the United Nations has summoned the leaders of the world to a special summit on what we know is a global poverty emergency. </p> <p>You know, in the museum in Rwanda which commemorates the millions who lost their lives as the world looked the other way, there is a picture of a young boy called David - a ten year old who was tortured to death. His last words were \"don't worry - the United Nations will come for us\". </p> <p>But we never did. That child believed the best of us only to discover that the pieties repeated so often meant in reality nothing at all. The words \"never again\" became just a slogan and not what it should be - the crucible in which are values are tested. I tell you, this Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation. </p> <p>So the poor will not go unheard tomorrow at the United Nations, because we the British people will speak up for them and for justice.</p> <p>The fair society. Fairness at home. Fairness in the world - that's the new settlement for new times. </p> <p>I know what I believe.</p> <p>I know who I am.</p> <p>I know what I want to do in this job.</p> <p>And I know that the way to deal with tough times is to face them down.</p> <p>Stay true to your beliefs.</p> <p>Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community.</p> <p>Because this job is not about me, it's about you. </p> <p>And I'll tell you what else I've learned - that tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve. </p> <p>You know when I talk to the people who do the tough jobs - nurses, teachers, police officers, soldiers, carers - about why they do what they do, so often they say to me \"because I want to make a difference\". </p> <p>And doesn't each of us want to say of ourselves:</p> <p>That I helped someone in need.</p> <p>That I come to the aid of a neighbour in distress.</p> <p>That I will not pass by on the other side.</p> <p>That I will give of myself for something bigger than myself. </p> <p>And each of us can make a contribution - but together we are even more than that. <br>United we are a great movement led by hopes not fears, gathered person by person - one individual, and then a few more, then hundreds, then thousands, then finally millions strong, a movement where I want each of us to say to each other:<br>This is our country, Britain. We are building it together, together we are making it greater;</p> <p>Together we are building the fair society in this place and in this generation. </p> <p>The mission of our times- the fair society, the cause that drives us on - and we will win, not for the sake of our party, together we will win for the future of our country.</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.rawrip.com/\">Rawrip</a></strong> is a two-year old firm specialising in technology for selling music online, from recommendation systems to retail applications for social networks.</p> <p>The site employs 30 people, both full and part time, working across research and development , marketing, label relations and technology. Privately funded and based in Shoreditch, London, Rawrip was founded in 2006 by <strong>Vartan Sarkissian</strong>, who introduces the site.</p> <p><br><em>Rawrip founder Vartan Sarkissian</em></p> <p><strong>Explain your business to my Mum.<br></strong> \"I've tried to explain this \"internet thing\" to my mum before so I hope I have better luck with yours. RAWRIP is an online music radio and shop where any musician and label can sell their songs and get 100% of the sales money. They can even use our portable shops called RAWSTORES to have their music sold on other websites such as MySpace and Facebook and still earn 100% royalties. So if an artist has a lot of fans on MySpace, they can use our service to sell their music to those fans.&lt;</p> <p>\"Fans can get now over 1m songs you can listen to for free on the website and a lot of free music to download. To assist you with finding new music, we have developed the online equivalent to a personal shopper: 'The Rippler'. You tell The Rippler what artists you like and it will come back with a suggested list of music that has similar features. You can then listen to all this music for free, purchase it, share it or store it in your online library.\"</p> <p><strong>How do you make money?<br></strong> \"RAWRIP is based on an ad-funded business model. In the future we will introduce small value-add subscription services but our intention is that everyone will be able to access and use a good portion of the service for free.\"</p> <p><strong>Any weird business experiences so far?<br></strong> \"Of course - it's the music business! In one of the first meetings I had with a label in LA, the guy had a pet pig. The little pink creature kept nibbling at my shoelaces whilst I was trying to have a serious business conversation. But we actually ended up doing the deal with him and have his content up on the website.\"</p> <p><strong>What's your background?<br></strong> \"I studied classical piano at the age of seven in the Yerevan State Music Conservatory. Later on, after studying management and then media and communication in the UK and the US, I worked at MGM studios in LA. I worked in film for few years before setting up RAWRIP to concentrate on my passion for music. I still try and play music every day.\"</p> <p><strong>How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business?<br></strong> \"Personalisation is key to all internet businesses. On RAWRIP, artists and fans can personalise their profiles including blogs, videos, tour dates, etc. 'The Rippler' is central to the service and differs from other recommendation technologies; it does not depend on statistics gathered on the artist but acoustical similarities between songs.</p> <p>\"On a broader scale, recommendation forms an important basis on which we as a young company operate.

The burst showed us that while it is good to have faith and be excited, it is best to be focused on creating a real business and be grounded.

  "<p>Newly elected Kadima leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/20/israelandthepalestinians\">Tzipi Livni</a> is the third person to lead this party in its less than three years of existence. In terms of presentation, she represents a significant change in Israeli politics. In terms of her core position on key issues, however, Livni has a great deal in common with her predecessor, the <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1221976325874&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">newly-resigned</a> Ehud Olmert. Both followed a similar trajectory from the right of Israeli politics to its centre or centre left. The two undertook this journey for similar reasons. And these reasons are based on a similar reading of the key dynamics of Israel and the Middle East. This reading curiously omits a number of key factors, while exaggerating others.</p> <p>The essence of both Livni and Olmert's view of Israel's strategic position is a very pronounced pessimism. Both of them believe that Israel is suffering from a slow erosion of its international legitimacy. As Livni expressed it in a recent speech: </p> <blockquote> <p>A process of erosion is taking place in Israel's basic positions on everything related to ending the Israel-Palestinian conflict in the international community. <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2008/Address%20by%20FM%20Livni%20to%20INSS%20conference%2022-Jun-2008\">Issues</a> that were very obvious to us and principles that we could clearly stick to are gradually being worn down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Livni explains this statement in the following terms: \"<a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2008/Address%20by%20FM%20Livni%20to%20INSS%20conference%2022-Jun-2008\">Today</a>, the existence of Israel is being delegitimised, not just its physical survival but also its existence as a national home for the Jewish people.\" She considers preserving and re-building Israel's receding international legitimacy is dependent upon achieving Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>This view directly parallels statements made by Olmert. Olmert, too, considered that Israel was \"<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929439.html\">finished</a>\" unless a rapid two-state agreement could be reached with the secular Palestinian leadership. Olmert, like Livni, based this view on what he regarded as Israel's declining international legitimacy. His view was that a failure to reach a final status accord would result in a \"civil rights\" struggle by the Palestinians, which would find support in the western world.</p> <p>Kadima's leaders, since the <a href=\"http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Modern+History/Historic+Events/The+Annapolis+Conference+27-Nov-2007.htm\">Annapolis conference</a> of November 2007, have adopted a stance of commitment to the belief in historic compromise with al-Fatah. Unlike the left, however, the leaders of Kadima are committed to this path not because of hope, but because of fear. </p> <p>The odd thing about their fear is that it fails to correspond with current realities. First of all, by any measurable standards, Israel's international standing is not substantively declining. A vociferous movement to try and make this happen exists on the European (particularly the British) left. But at the risk of upsetting some readers of Comment is Free, it must be pointed out that this movement has enjoyed no substantive and lasting successes. </p> <p>Rather, the key dynamics of the region are serving to turn the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a second-tier conflict \u2013 of substantively declining importance to the region and the world as a whole. </p> <p>The really important and dangerous strategic processes and events today are happening far to the east of the Levant. Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the scenes for the truly vital battle taking place between the west and its allies and the forces of various versions of Islamic revival. The eye of this storm is the Iranian <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/27/asia/nukes.php\"> nuclear programme</a>. In its dimensions and in it significance, this fight dwarfs all other regional processes.</p> <p>This central dynamic is producing a new strategic map in the Middle East. It places Israel effectively on the same side as Egypt, Jordan, the Gulf states and perhaps Iraq \u2013 against Iran, Syria and their clients \u2013 in a new regional cold war. The latter, in turn, are interested in Israel in so far as they would like to see it destroyed. But this desire is in no way affected by or connected to any existing or future negotiating process between Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>The vitally important process of the Islamisation of regional politics that underlies all this is in turn redefining the stances of the Palestinians. Hamas is holding its ground in the Gaza Strip. Its de facto rule over 40% of the Palestinian residents west of the Jordan River renders any idea of a secular \"civil rights\" struggle by the Palestinians absurd. The ineffectual Fatah-controlled West Bank Palestinian Authority remains forever locked in its patron-client relationship with the EU and the US. The trend on the ground there too is toward greater religious and political militancy. </p> <p>At the same time, the local situation west of the Jordan is currently under control. Few people are dying. Like many other festering sores in the region, the dispute needs an equitable solution. But it is for the moment containable. </p> <p>Now none of this is cause for celebration for Israel. Much of it is very worrying. But what it emphatically does mean is that neither Israel's existence, nor the preservation of its relations with the west, nor its links with its de facto regional allies, are dependent on reaching an ever-elusive compromise deal with an ever-less relevant Palestinian secular nationalist camp. The trends point elsewhere. In these fearful days for the region, it seems strange to point to a fear that is almost wholly without basis. But the core outlook of the two Kadima leaders currently exchanging the baton of Israel's leadership appears to be based on such a phenomenon.</p>",
  "<p>The closing date for applications to be the Arts Council's new chair, to succeed Sir Christopher Frayling, is tomorrow. So sharpen those pencils, potentials! Names being bandied about include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Eyre\">Richard Eyre</a>, apparently favoured by his successor at the helm of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner; and Genista McIntosh, also formerly of the National Theatre, who so thoroughly whipped ACE into shape in her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2008/jul/30/arts.council.funding\">report</a> into the debacle over the last funding round.</p> <p>But who would you like to see as the next chair of the Arts Council? My own view is that it must be someone who complements and contrasts with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/apr/14/art.artsfunding\">Alan Davey</a>, the chief exec. Davey is thoughtful (a good thing) and perhaps sometimes a little diffident, so someone really dynamic and charismatic who can talk the talk would be a good thing. I also think that after 60 years, ACE really should be appointing a woman. And finally \u2013 I've a hunch it would be good to have someone from outside the arts. Davey is marinated in the arts, and fantastically knowledgable. So I reckon it would be good to have someone who has a real enthusiasm for culture, and can strongly represent its claims to the Government and elsewhere, without necessarily coming from within that world: a fresh eye, so to speak. So a dynamic, fabulous, clever woman from the private sector or broadcasting? (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Abramsky\">Jenny Abramsky</a>, of course, is taken \u2013 she starts as chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund next week.)

  "<p><strong>How did the scandal first emerge?</strong></p> <p>The deputy governor of Hebei province, where the Sanlu company is based, said the firm received customer complaints from March. But it was not until August 2 that it informed the city government of Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Officials there waited more than a month, until September 9, to inform their bosses in the provincial government. A day later, Beijing learned of the scandal and Sanlu finally ordered a recall.</p> <p>New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, has also said she stepped in and told officials to inform Beijing directly after Fonterra - Sanlu's New Zealand-based partner - informed its own government of the problem.</p> <p>An editor at the Southern Weekend newspaper said on his blog that - as reports of problems with an unspecified baby formula surfaced - he decided to go ahead with a story his reporter had been preparing. It was rejected, but Sanlu ordered a recall that night.</p> <p>Rumours that the company's products were causing infant health problems reached Chinese reporters by July, but they appear to have believed the issue would be too sensitive to cover in the run-up to the Olympics.</p> <p><strong>How many products are affected?</strong></p> <p>Batches from 22 of China's 109 baby milk powder producers were found to contain melamine - including the country's two largest dairy firms, Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group. Other products, ranging from fresh milk to ice-cream and sweets, have also been found to contain the substance. But to date all cases of illness have been linked to Sanlu baby formula, shown to have had far higher levels of melamine than other powders in tests.</p> <p><strong>Who is responsible?</strong></p> <p>Individual dairy farmers and collection stations which sell their raw milk on to companies are being blamed for adding melamine.</p> <p>According to the agriculture department's website, its minister Sun Zhengcai told the health and public security ministries today: \"Since milk stations began only in recent years, the country now has no specific method of supervising them, or clear-cut supervision department. The purchasing process of raw milk is basically out of control.\"</p> <p>But others believe that Sanlu and officials must take responsibility for failing to act when alerted to the problems. The former general manager of Sanlu, fired due to the scandal, has been arrested by police, along with numerous milk-sellers. The mayor, party boss and other city officials in Shijiazhuang have been sacked and China's food standards boss has resigned.</p> <p><strong>Why has the problem emerged now?</strong></p> <p>The highly-respected business magazine Caijing argues that business reforms are the key. From the late 1980s, dairy companies - led by Sanlu - began hiving off production to individual farmers and creating milk collection centres. But in 2006, the industry hit a crisis as feed costs rose while increased competition led to lower prices. The introduction of price controls in January this year may have been the final straw.</p> <p>The lower prices may have encouraged farmers to tamper with their product to ensure that companies accepted it. But decreasing supply may also have made some collection centres or companies more willing to accept substandard milk.</p> <p>Another theory is that the problem could have emerged because of efforts to improve safety in the wake of another baby powder scandal. At least 12 babies died of malnutrition in Anhui in 2004 after drinking fake formula. That may have encouraged a greater focus on nutrition levels in milk - unwittingly creating an incentive to add melamine to boost apparent protein levels.</p> <p>According to police, melamine was being sold to milk suppliers at least as early as February last year, but it is not clear when the practice began.</p> <p><strong>What has the government done?</strong></p> <p>The government has sent out thousands of inspectors to monitor production and pledged to pay the medical expenses of affected children. Premier Wen Jiabao has also issued an apology. \"As the head of the government, I feel extremely guilty ... I sincerely<br>apologise to all of you,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What we are doing now is to ensure that nothing like this will ever happen again, and we are not only talking about milk. We will never let the same situation repeat with any kind of food product,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"Please trust us. We will strengthen quality control on new products to ensure that there will not be any more issues. Public confidence can only be rebuilt on merciless punishment.\"</p> <p><strong>How are consumers reacting?</strong></p> <p>Many parents have turned to imported, foreign milk powder - if they can afford it. The Beijing News reported that others are hiring wet nurses, offering to pay a monthly salary of 8,000 to 10,000 yuan (\u00a3635-790) - a huge wage in China. A domestic service company in Shenzhen said that last year only a dozen people asked for a wet nurse, whereas more than 20 people a day are now making inquiries.</p> <p>With concern widening to include other dairy products, Beijing Ddchu Foodstuff Company, the capital's biggest soya milk producer, said sales had risen by 20-30%.</p> <p>&amp;149; Additional research by Alice Xin Liu</p>",
  "<p>A student who killed nine people when he opened fire at a school in Finland today had been questioned over YouTube footage in which he was shown firing a gun, the Finnish interior minister said.</p> <p>Anne Holmlund said the man, aged around 22, was detained for questioning yesterday but released because police had no legal reason to hold him.</p> <p>The gunman - who has not so far been named - used a .22 caliber handgun in today's attack, which happened at the Kauhajoki Palvelualojen Oppilaitos vocational school, 300km (180 miles) north-west of Helsinki, Holmlund said. </p> <p>She added that the man had received a license for the weapon last month.</p> <p>Finnish police said the man, identified as a student or former student at the school, killed nine people before turning the weapon on himself.</p> <p>A hospital official said the man had been \"severely injured\" by a gunshot wound to the head.<br> The shooting, at a school for students aged 16 and over, was the second school shooting in Finland over the last 12 months.

  "<p>Georgia today said it had shot down a Russian drone over territory close to the breakaway province of South Ossetia, which is due to be patrolled by EU observers.</p> <p>The interior ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, said Georgian police downed the reconnaissance drone yesterday in the central district of Gori. The drone was spying on Georgian troops and the country's oil pipeline, he said.</p> <p>Russia this morning dismissed the claim as \"provocation\".</p> <p>The incident is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">latest in a series of skirmishes</a> along the border with the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia involving Russian and separatist forces and Georgian police.</p> <p>It comes ahead of next week's deployment of 200 EU observers in Georgia as part of a ceasefire deal. Yesterday, the head of the EU's mission to Georgia, Hansjoerg Haber, promised that the 200 observers would be in place near the cities of Gori, Zugdidi and Poti by October 1.</p> <p>Russia is refusing to allow the observers to deploy inside South Ossetia and Abkhazia and says it intends to keep some 8,000 troops in both provinces. Moscow unilaterally recognised the provinces as independent last month.</p> <p>Today, the EU's main rapporteur, or investigator, on Russia, Luc Van den Brande, said Russia's plan to maintain a substantial military presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia was in breach of last month's French-brokered ceasefire deal, which ended the war between Russia and Georgia.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal signed by the president, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia is obliged to pull its forces back to positions they occupied before August 7, when hostilities started, Van den Brande said.</p> <p>\"We have to return to the situation <em>ex ante</em> [before the event]. Russia has to go to where it was before the 7th. We have raised very concretely our concerns,\" Van den Brande said. Under the agreement, EU observers should also be deployed inside South Ossetia and Abkhazia as well as in Georgia \"proper\", he added.</p> <p>Van den Brande visited Moscow today as part of a nine-member cross-party delegation from the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE). The delegation, which flies to Tbilisi tomorrow, is on a fact-finding mission ahead of next week's debate in the Strasbourg assembly on the \"consequences\" of the Georgia-Russia war.</p> <p>Both countries are members of the Council of Europe. Today, Van den Brande said it was unlikely Russia would be kicked out of the 47-nation group, despite calls by some MEPs to punish Moscow. At the same time, he acknowledged that both countries had failed to live up to the council's democratic \"common values\".</p> <p>Referring to Russia's claim that it had \"privileged interests\" in neighbouring post-Soviet countries, Van den Brande said: \"Russia has to understand that its near-abroad policy is no longer in place. At the same time, we are saying to the Georgians that they have to be respectful to their neighbours.\"</p> <p>The situation along Georgia's border with South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains tense. On Sunday, one Georgian police officer was killed and three others were wounded after separatist Abkhaz fighters opened fire. Yesterday, another two Georgian officers were wounded when they went to the area to investigate and stepped on a mine.</p> <p>As well as blocking EU observers from Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Moscow has balked at letting in more monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) into South Ossetia, where many Georgian homes were looted and set alight. South Ossetian militias have razed at least five Georgian villages near the capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>The OSCE had hoped to send an additional 80 unarmed observers to South Ossetia, but talks with Russia broke down last week.</p> <p>War in Georgia broke out on August 7 when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2008/aug/13/georgia.russia\">Georgian forces attacked South Ossetia's main city</a> to try to regain control over the area. Russia repelled the offensive, routed its army and occupied large swaths of Georgian territory.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.jcs.mil/bio_odierno.html\">Lieutenant General Ray Odierno</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/16/iraq.usa\">took over command of coalition forces in Iraq</a> this week at a time when the \"surge has succeeded\" narrative has cemented the perception that American military tactics are the primary driver of events on the ground. But the reality confronting Gen Odierno <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/17/iraq.military\">could not be more different</a>. A confident Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, and other Iraqi actors are now firmly in control, leaving the scope of US military action severely limited. Despite the continued presence of nearly 140,000 US troops, America is <a href=\"http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JI10Ak01.html\">not even the most influential foreign power in Iraq</a>. Those troops are in fact an impediment to the political progress that must occur to secure a sustainable resolution to Iraq's numerous conflicts. The only responsible course of action for the next president is to drawdown US forces, increasing the stakes for Iraqi leaders and encouraging compromise rather than confrontation as they address their differences. </p> <p>Maliki's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4932468.stm\">transformation</a> has been as swift as it was unexpected. Rescued from political extinction just 10 months ago, after the intervention of Condoleezza Rice prevented him from being voted out by his coalition partners, Maliki surprised most observers with an aggressive military push this spring to retake Basra from Shia militias, particularly <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/al-sadr.htm\">Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army</a>. When that campaign faltered, Iran stepped in to save Maliki by pressuring Sadr to stand down both in the south and in Sadr City. Both bailouts have dramatically altered the landscape in Iraq. Maliki now appears to be doing Iran's bidding but relying on the crutch of American troops to back him up.</p> <p>Maliki has consolidated his position and is increasing the power of the central government, directing Iraq's ever-growing military and intelligence apparatus independent of US control for the first time since the invasion. Emboldened by success in Basra and Sadr City, the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad is now projecting power into areas controlled by its ethnic and sectarian rivals. In the span of these short months the pendulum has swung entirely on the perceptions of Maliki, going from concerns about his alarming weakness to fears of dangerous over-confidence. </p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.iraqupdates.com/p_articles.php/article/35760\">Maliki ordered the Iraqi army into the mostly Kurdish town of Khanaqin</a> ostensibly as part of a broader military operation to root out al-Qaida militants in Diyala province. The move inflamed the Kurds, whose Peshmerga forces had kept out al-Qaida, and most viewed it as a naked power play by Baghdad. The standoff between the Kurdish Regional Government and Baghdad over Khanaqin has exacerbated Arab-Kurdish tensions and further imperiled any negotiated settlement in Kirkuk.</p> <p>Next month, the central government will take over the Sunni Awakening Councils, the programme of <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gkx-3oYeFwuWKCusr2jrojs98w8wD932NTQ01\">US payments to Sunnis to turn against the insurgency</a> that began in 2006 and is responsible for much of the reduction in violence. Maliki has pledged to integrate as many as 20,000 of these armed Sunni \"sons of Iraq\" into the security forces, but there are disturbing signs that the Shia government is orchestrating a campaign to harass, intimidate or arrest them, which could reignite Sunni-Shia conflict. </p> <p>Iran is the ultimate beneficiary of these actions against the Kurds and the Sunnis. Tehran has its own <a href=\"http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=182\">Kurdish problem</a> and does not want the Kurds in Iraq to establish firm control in the oil-rich areas beyond its current base in the three provinces in the north of Iraq. And, of course, the Shia mullahs have been in constant conflict with Iraq's Sunnis ever since they came to power in 1979, and have a vested interest in their continued marginalisation in post-Saddam Iraq. Even if these moves go bad it would serve Iranian interests, as Iraq would be weakened by spasms of violence, and it could prolong American involvement creating additional time for Iran to further develop its nuclear programme.</p> <p>The cruel irony for Gen Odierno is that although American troops made vital contributions to the reduction in violence, there is nothing they can do to resolve these burgeoning conflicts, and the very stability that they provide is encouraging the various factions to aggressively advance their own objectives at the expense of necessary compromise which jeopardises these hard-fought gains.</p> <p>Success in Iraq is now dependent upon increasing the incentives for Iraqi leaders toward accommodation. The best way to achieve this objective is to create an environment in which Iraqis are responsible for the full consequences of their actions. The large US troop presence is currently doing the opposite, embedding a moral hazard among Iraq's leaders and inhibiting consensus. The only way to preserve the gains of the last 18 months is to begin the orderly withdrawal of US troops.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists claim to have discovered evidence for large releases of methane into the atmosphere from frozen seabed stores off the northern coast of Siberia. </p> <p>A large injection of the gas - which is 21 times more potent as an atmospheric heat trap than carbon dioxide - has long been cited by climate scientists as the potential trigger for runaway global warming. The warming caused by the gas could destabilise permafrost further, they fear, leading to yet more methane release.</p> <p>But climate experts have expressed caution at the claims, which have yet to be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal. Methane release from stores of so-called gas hydrates, that can form on land or under the sea, is not new to researchers. Huge quantities are known to exist in the Arctic, but special circumstances would need to exist for significant releases to occur.</p> <p>\"Methane release has been known for a number of years now,\" said geologist Dr Lorenz Schwark at the University of Cologne, Germany. \"There are various areas around the world that have been studied in detail.\"</p> <p>He said the process of methane release from hydrates had been filmed by robotic vehicles off the coast of Vancouver Island in Canada, for example.</p> <p>\"The problem is that in the Russian or in the Siberian Arctic on land and in the sea there is very little coverage by hard data and there are hardly any measurements. And therefore there is a lot of speculation going on.\"</p> <p>In most cases, methane released from the sea bed is consumed by micro-organisms as it bubbles up to the surface. But if it is released quickly enough it could make it into the atmosphere. </p> <p>\"The most likely process where this happens - and there is geological evidence that it has happened in the past - is when the methane gas hydrate layer in the sediment destabilises on a slope. And then we have a slope failure, a landslide underwater,\" Dr Schwark said.</p> <p>\"As long as the scientists in the Siberian Arctic are not able to report very strong increases in submarine landslides and slope failures, I wouldn't expect that the release into the atmosphere is so severe that it is really very serious at the moment,\" Schwark added.</p> <p>The scientists who have studied methane levels along Russia's northern coastline are aboard the Russian research ship Jacob Smirnitskyi. </p> <p>\u00d6rjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University in Sweden told the Independent newspaper in an email from the vessel: \"An extensive area of intense methane release was found. At earlier sites we had found elevated levels of dissolved methane. </p> <p>\"Yesterday, for the first time, we documented a field where the release was so intense that the methane did not have time to dissolve into the seawater but was rising as methane bubbles to the sea surface. These 'methane chimneys' were documented on echo sounder and with seismic [instrument].\"</p> <p>At some locations he said concentrations of the gas were 100 times the background level. These anomalies were documented in the East Siberian Sea and the Laptev Sea, covering several tens of thousands of square kilometres.</p> <p>Gustafsson added: \"The conventional thought has been that the permafrost 'lid' on the sub-sea sediments on the Siberian shelf should cap and hold the massive reservoirs of shallow methane deposits in place. </p> <p>\"The growing evidence for release of methane in this inaccessible region may suggest that the permafrost lid is starting to get perforated and thus leaking methane.\"</p> <p>Estimates for the amount of carbon locked up in the hydrates vary from 500 to 5000 gigatonnes. Scientists predict that warming will release some of these deposits, but modelling the temperature rise that would trigger significant releases has proved extremely difficult.</p>",
  "<p>Jurors today visited the south London underground station where Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead by police marksmen three years ago.</p> <p>The second day of the long-awaited inquest into the death of the 27-year-old Brazilian saw the entire court travel to Stockwell tube station.</p> <p>The court took just six minutes to travel less than a mile in a coach convoy from the Oval cricket ground, where the inquest is being held to accommodate the number of lawyers and media representatives.</p> <p>A team of four police motorcycle outriders stopped traffic in every direction as a television helicopter hovered overhead.</p> <p>The six women and five men of the jury did not travel through the ticket barriers like De Menezes on July 22 2005.

  "<p><em>Ban Ki-Moon is secretary general of the United Nations</em></p> <p>We all recognise today's perils. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">global financial crisis</a>. A global energy crisis. A global food crisis. Trade talks have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2793938/Doha-world-trade-talks-collapse-in-blow-to-globalisation.html\">collapsed</a>, yet again.</p> <p>There are new outbreaks of war and violence. Climate change ever more clearly threatens our planet. We say that global problems demand global solutions.</p> <p>And yet, do we act? In truth, today, we also face a crisis of a different sort \u2013 the challenge of global leadership. New centres of power and leadership are emerging \u2013 in Asia, Latin America and across the newly developed world.</p> <p>In this new world, the challenges are increasingly those of collaboration, not confrontation. Nations can no longer protect their interests, or advance the wellbeing of their people, without the partnership of the rest.</p> <p>Yet I see a danger of nations looking inward rather than toward a shared future. I see a danger of retreating from the progress we have made, particularly in the realm of economic development and fairness in sharing the fruits of global growth.</p> <p>Yes, global growth has raised billions of people out of poverty. Yet if you are among the world's poor, you have never felt poverty so sharply. Yes, international law and justice have never been so widely embraced. Yet those living in nations where human rights are abused have never been so vulnerable.</p> <p>Yes, most of us live in peace and security. Yet violence is deepening in many nations: Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, and Sudan.</p> <p>Their problems are part of the development emergency we face. Over the past year, the price of fuel, food, and commodities rose alarmingly. Wealthy countries worry about recession, while the poor can no longer afford to eat.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/mdg/\">millennium development goals</a> are part of the solution. But progress here has been uneven. Pledges have not been honoured. Yet we have achieved enough to know that the goals are within reach.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/ga/\">United Nations</a> is the champion of the most vulnerable. When disaster strikes, we act. We did so this year in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-10-Haiti-floods_N.htm\">Haiti</a> and other Caribbean nations hit by hurricanes. We did so after Cyclone Nargis in Myanmar, where the challenge now is to push for political progress, including credible steps on human rights and democracy.</p> <p>We have helped people affected by severe flooding in south-east Asia, and by drought in the Horn of Africa, where 14 million need emergency help. Since taking office, I have called for more strenuous action in Somalia. Must we wait \u2013 and see more children die in the sand?</p> <p>The global food crisis will not go away by itself. It may now have faded from the headlines. Last year at this time, rice cost $330 a ton. Today it is $730. People who used to buy rice by the bag now do so by the handful. Those who ate two meals a day now get by on one.</p> <p>The UN has focused on getting seeds and fertilisers into the hands of small farmers. We seek a new \"green revolution\" in Africa. But we lack new resources. The international community has not matched words with deeds.</p> <p>In Burundi and Sierra Leone, Liberia and Timor Leste, our resources are under strain because UN peacekeepers are helping nations turn the corner to peace. Yet the UN's preventive diplomacy is often critical. We see the fruits in Nepal, Kenya and, we hope, Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Likewise, there is a real chance to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/cyprus.greece\">reunify Cyprus</a>. In Georgia, the UN can help ease the tensions resulting from the recent conflict. In Cote d'Ivoire, we will help organise elections before year's end \u2013 a major stride toward recovery and democracy.</p> <p>But it is dangerous to think that the UN can address today's complex problems without the full backing of its member states. In Darfur, for example, we face a continuing challenge in meeting deployment deadlines. We lack critical assets and personnel. If not matched by resources, mandates are empty.</p> <p>And now all of our work \u2013 financing for development, social spending in rich nations and poor, the millennium development goals, peacekeeping \u2013 is endangered by the global financial crisis. We need to restore order to international financial markets. We must think about a new global economic order that more fully reflects the changing realities of our time.</p> <p>Those realities call for continuous UN action on countless fronts: combating malaria and Aids, reducing maternal and child mortality, fighting global terrorism, and ensuring nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. On the Korean peninsula, all the agreements of the six-party talks must be implemented, and Iran must comply with security council resolutions and cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p> <p>The area of human rights, above all, demands our vigilance. Justice must be treated as a pillar of peace, security, and development. We must advance the \"responsibility to protect.\" Despite the real political difficulties, we cannot let crimes against humanity go unpunished.</p> <p>Climate change remains the defining issue of our era. We must regain our momentum. Our first test comes in three months in <a href=\"http://www.poznan2008.com/\">Poznan</a>, Poland. By then, we need a shared vision of a new global climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which runs out in 2012.</p> <p>The foundation of all the UN's work is accountability. We need to change the UN's culture. We must become faster, more flexible, and more effective \u2013 more modern. We must replace our current system of contracts and conditions of service, which are dysfunctional and demoralising.</p> <p>But the UN's member states must be accountable as well. Resolutions mandating peace operations cannot continue to be passed without the necessary troops, money, and material. We cannot send brave UN staff \u2013 25 of whom died this year \u2013 around the world without assuring their security. We cannot reform this organisation without the required resources.</p> <p>Today's uncertainties will pass, but only if we act wisely and responsibly. By doing so, we will set the stage for a new era of stability and global prosperity, more widely and equitably shared. </p> <p>In cooperation with <a href=\"www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",

So we're not sure who or what Marina's Diamonds are, but then it took us quite a while to work out what Florence's Machine was, let alone Joe Lean's Jing Jang Jong. <br> The Welsh-born musician insists that her birthplace was \"Ancient Greece\" and that her heroes are Brody Dalle and Britney. Her songs are hard to fathom. They veer between simple keyboards-based ballads and more upbeat and catchy, quirky new wave-inflected numbers enhanced by bass, guitar and drums. In the latter instances, we're assuming the sprightly nature of the music is an ironic cover for lyrics critical of modern mores in general and the male of the species in particular. \"You're only as sick as your secrets,\" she says at the top of her MySpace, by way of a clue.  Further evidence that we're dealing with a seriously warped mind in the body of a fox are her highly entertaining and angry, if grammatically unorthodox, musings on her website, which range from verbal annihilations of female pop stars to the vapidity of contemporary celeb culture. You get the impression that, in Marina's twisted imagination, women are weight-obsessed WAGs and men are all creepy sleazebags. \"I'm really sick, tired, depressed, uninspired by women,\" she writes. \"Vacant. Airbrushed. Empty. People. Getting. Paid. To talk. About fuck all. It's great that Eva Longoria looks hot in a bikini, but if the sun dies and the world plummets into darkness and ice, will anyone fucking care?\" Lily Allen? She's not having it. \"She was quite good until she wrecked it all by turning into everything she's not. i.e. going on a diet, dying her hair slapper-blonde and flashing her boobies.\" As for trying to compare her to Kate Nash, don't even go there. \"Because OOPS! I have a vagina and a keyboard!!!! WE SO SIMILAR!\" Any fellas out there who haven't run and hid yet, a word of advice: don't nudge her during her gigs or you'll get it in the neck, too, as one poor punter found out to his cost recently. \"Hi to the ecstasy ridden guy who tried to tip my keyboard on the last song. I threw a girl punch, and as girl punches go, totally missed and clipped his jaw. May music never grace your grotty ears again. Loser. And say hi to your drug dealer for me. He made you look super fucking hot that night. Hehehe x.\" Ouch.  She doesn't sing like a harpy, more like one of those kooky new wave girls like Lene Lovich, all whoops, hollers, cackles and shrieks that make her sound strangely mid-European. It provides a neat counterpoint to the music. Seventeen opens with just piano, almost like an Elvis Costello circa-Armed Forces pop ditty, then starts to resemble one of those novelty synth-pop groups from the late 70s like Flying Lizards. The Shampain Sleeper, about using alcohol as an anaesthetic for a painful existence, sounds like fag-end-of-glam hit Glass of Champagne by Sailor and not just because they have a similar title \u2013 it's got that weird mid-70s synth-glam stomp. Girls Girls Girls, a collaboration with New Order and Ladyhawke producer Pascal Gabriel, is a brilliant full-band performance and a potentially huge smash hit in which Marina bitches about women who have Botox and go on diets and recommends that we stuff yoghurts and stick to apple pies. And you can dance to it. We've Got Obsessions explains those Kate Nash comparisons, all mournful piano, voice to the fore and references to the miserable minutiae of everyday life, crackers and all. An intriguing young lady and no mistake. <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"We bet she was the girl with the best voice at school who shunned the choir and maddened the music teacher by focusing on lads and lager rather than Rachmaninov or reading music.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We're not sure how you'd market such a maverick, but there's something here worth bottling, some zeitgeist-y female essence. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Pore over heat then write a scathing critique of its content.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Count the calories.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Marina is currently deal-less but she's appearing on the Wonky Pop Halloween Special bill at Cargo in east London on October 31. <br> <strong><br>File next to:</strong> Lene Lovich, Hazel O'Connor, Kate Nash, Kate Bush.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/marinaandthediamonds\">www.myspace.com/marinaandthediamonds</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> To the Bones</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> Journalists have to create narratives. To make sense of events, and to make them interesting, they have to turn them into stories. (We don't use the word by accident.) </p> <p>And that's why today's speech by Gordon Brown has been widely billed as the most important of his life, a make-or-break event that will determine whether or not he survives as prime minister.</p> <p>In fact, the truth is a bit more complicated. Even if Brown were to deliver a speech worthy of comparison with Martin Luther King, it's hard to imagine Charles Clarke coming out saying: \"Sorry, chaps, I got it all wrong. Never mind about the polls. I'm backing Gordon 100%.\"</p> <p>And, equally, there's no way Brown is going to deliver a speech of such awfulness that it results in David Miliband, or any of the other cabinet ministers who have been backing him in public, popping up on the PM programme at 5pm to say: \"It's all over, he's useless, I'm resigning.\"</p> <p>This speech, on its own, won't make or break Brown. But, alongside the budget (which is as important, but a lot more tedious), the prime minister's speech to party conference is the key defining moment in the British political calender and what we hear this afternoon will have a significant impact on Brown's fortunes over the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>In particular, I think there are five things to look out for.</p> <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Brown has been prime minister for just over a year and the evidence seems to be that the voters don't like him. Is there anything he will say or do this afternoon that could change that?</p> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> A leader's speech is often the moment when a party unveils big new policies. Labour has already briefed the media about Brown's plans to provide free computers and internet access to children from low-income families. It's commendable, but not a game-changer (and some of the broadcasters today were reporting a negative reaction from viewers). Has Brown got anything else up his sleeve?</p> <p><strong>The Tories:</strong> Labour has had trouble finding a plausible way of attacking David Cameron's Tories. Delegates will want to hear Brown condemn the Tories in language that will actually work when employed in election campaigns.</p> <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Brown needs to persuade his party that it can win the election. We know what his strategy is: Sit tight, focus on the economy and hope that the voters reward you for your diligence. But Brown needs to convince his party this will work.</p> <p><strong>Authority:</strong> This is the key one, a combination of the other four. At the moment Brown's authority looks diminished. He needs to reassert it.</p> <p>I'll be blogging from the moment the speech starts after lunch, at 2.15pm. Brown's speech should be available soon after he starts speaking from the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/conference\">Labour party website.</a></p> <p>But you can follow it live with me and I'll give an assessment of how he's performed as soon as he sits down. There will be lots of other instant reaction elsewhere on the website too.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>2.10pm:</strong> <br>You can tell it's starting soon because they're playing, loud, upbeat music in the conference hall. We've just had James's Sit Down, and U2's Beautiful Day.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.15pm:</strong> The audience are being told to take their seats. In the press centre there's a huge crowd of journalists at the press desk waiting for the party to release texts of the speech.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> It's Sarah Brown. What's she doing here? Thought Gordon didn't do the family stuff.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> We were expecting a video of Barack Obama. But Sarah's a welcome alternative.</p> <p>She's not leader, is she?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> No, she wants to talk to us. It's a Michelle Obama moment, I think. She's thanking them for the warm welcome the conference gave her and Gordon after their wedding. And she's proud of the motivation Labour has given him. She says they don't spend enough time celebrating what they've done.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> A video is being shown. It starts with Brown going to the palace, I think. Patrick Wintour tells me it's the same video they showed last year, with references to the minimum wage, the ban on landmines, the ban on foxhunting, extra staff in the NHS, the abolition of section 28, more teachers, free entry to museums - you get the general idea.</p> <p>And London winning the Olympics - wasn't that Tony?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Here's Obama: a clip from the Democratic candidate saying Brown has a clear vision of where to take the country.</p> <p>And then a clip of Alan Sugar praising Brown. (You're fired, jokes a colleague.)</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.25pm:</strong> Sarah welcomes Brown to the stage. A colleague wonders whether anyone is going to write a story about Obama interfering in the British electoral system.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> Brown's on stage now. He says he's very proud of Sarah. It must be nice to have a job where your wife joins you at work.</p> <p>Purplish tie, for anyone interested in these things.</p> <p>Purple backdrop, too.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> \"Thank goodness Sarah and I are a team. I'm very proud to be her husband.\"</p> <p>He is going to tell us about who he is, and what he wants to achieve.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> Leaders often start with a joke. Brown is being serious from the word go.</p> <p>He didn't come into politics to be a celebrity, or thinking he would always be popular. \"Perhaps that's just as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> He became an MP 25 years ago because he wanted to serve the country he loves. And he came to London not to join the establishment, but to change it. Sounds like Sarah Palin.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> He was brought up seeing his parents having to juggle bills. And he wants every child to be able to go to a great school, because he went to a great school.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> He says he hasn't served his children up in the papers because \"my children aren't props, they're people\". Quite a sharp attack on David Cameron.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Now he's on to an apology. He says it \"really hurt\" when the 10p tax band \"mistake\" suggested he wasn't on the side of ordinary families. Because being on the side of \"hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be\".</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> On to party loyalty now. He does not refer to the rebels directly, but says the British people would not forgive Labour if \"at this time we looked inwards\".</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> So Brown has now got the personal stuff, an apology and the party loyalty out of the way - all the tricky stuff. Now he's on to his vision for the future.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> Labour must be the \"rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand\".</p> <p>Insuring people against risks, and empowering people with new opportunities, is \"the mission of the hour\".</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> \"Those who don't believe in the potential of government should not be trusted to form one.\" A good soundbite - best so far, I think. The role of the government is perhaps the key dividing line with the Tories these days.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> The current economic turmoil shows the need for \"a new settlement for these times\".</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> \"A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise.\"</p> <p>Just as those who believed in the dogma of big government were wrong, so those who believe in the \"dogma of unbridled free market forces\" have been proved wrong again.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> Brown's on to his reform proposals for international finance now. I'm not sure the Labour delegates are that interested in the intricacies of the regulation of the international money markets.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> If Britain makes its changes, London will remain \"the financial centre of the world\". So the City vote should be sewn up then.</p> <p>The \"new settlement\" also involves action against climate change, and an end to \"the dictatorship of oil\". This is certainly a heavyweight menu he's feeding them.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> It's not just a duty, but Labour's \"basic philosophy\" to do everything to help people. He mentions the help for people with their fuel bills.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> But \"not even with Harry Potter\" can the government conjure up money to pay for everything. That's only the second joke, I think, and it's another weak one. No one's going to be asking who wrote the jokes at the post-speech briefing. But I suppose Brown wants to appear serious. At that, he's certainly succeeding.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> He's onto empowering again.</p> <p>He says Labour will be the party of law and order. But then he quickly moves on to pensioners, and families.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>2.45pm:</strong> He says he understands concerns about advertising aimed at children. Interesting. But he doesn't flesh it out.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> He says he understands concerns about advertising aimed at children. Interesting. But he doesn't flesh it out.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> On to employment. He talks about the three million jobs created.</p> <p>There's a good passage on what this actually means. An extra job is \"a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child\".</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> He sounds almost tearful at this point, or sentimental rather, as he describes how policy can change lives.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.50pm:</strong> Labour does it not because it makes good photo opportunities - another swipe at the Tories - but because \"fairness is in our DNA\". Bit of a cliche, that \"in our DNA\" line now, but it still works well.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> \"It's who we are - and what we're for.\"</p> <p>He's on to empowering people now. this is not just \"the new economic necessity\". It's the \"modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy.\" That's interesting - Labour is not on the left, but on the radical centre ground.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> He praises Harriet Harman. Ed Miliband, John Denham, Ruth Kelly and John Hutton also get a name check.</p> <p>He's on to personalised personal services now. Children's centres are opening all over the country.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> He reaffirms his commitment to extending free nursery education to two-year-olds, a policy he first unveiled at the weekend.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.55pm:</strong> Labour is still committed to the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. He says the government will make this a statutory commitment. That's new, I think. It sounds good, but I'm not sure what it will mean in practice.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> On to education, and he promises a guaranteed right to personal catch-up tuition for children who leave primary school unable to read, write and count. A colleague says the government has already made this commitment.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> And he makes the free internet access announcement briefed yesterday. He praises NHS workers. And he applauds. I suppose he's applauding them, but it looks a bit as if he's applauding himself.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3pm:</strong> This is a personal mission, he says. He says he told Labour the story in Bournemouth (he pronounces it wrong) last year about how he lost the sight in one eye when he was young. Now he wants to make the point that he almost lost the sight in his second eye then. \"At that point my future was books on tape.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> He sounds genuinely impassioned at this point. Because of the \"miraculous difference\" a surgeon made to him he's passionate about the values of the NHS.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Labour will be the first country in the world to offer universal check-ups for everyone over 40.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> Moving on to science, he says one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have gone to science research.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> The \u00a315bn being invested into medical research \"will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients\". Eh? Don't they do this anyway?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>3.05pm:</strong> On to cancer. From next year cancer patients will not pay prescription charges at all.</p> <p>This is getting sustained applause.</p> <p>Eventually the government will abolish charges for all long-term conditions. This goes down well to, although Brown says it's dependent on savings in the drugs budget.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> On to pensioners. The government will bring forward plans to help people stay longer in their own homes, instead of having to go into care. And it will provide \"greater protection against the costs of care\".</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>3.10pm:</strong> These are causes worth fighting for, he says.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> Back on to crime. The government will create an independent commissioner for victims. That was a proposal in the Louise Casey review of the criminal justice system.</p> <p>On migration, he defends the new points-based system. it's fair to the people who play by the rules.</p> <p>Labour has traditionally been the home of big ideas, ideas that become accepted as the norm: votes for working men, and then for women, anti-discrimination legislation, and more.</p> <p>But \"every single blow we have struck for fairness and the future has been opposed by the Conservatives\".</p> <p>Under the Tories there would have been no New Deal, no Sure Start etc. \"So let's hear no more from the Conservatives. We did fix the roof while the sun was shining.\"</p> <p>This gets a big cheer. It's a clever inversion of one of David Cameron's lines.</p> <p>He goes on to attack the Conservatives' record over Northern Rock. Some of his claims are suspect. He says that under Conservative policy, there would be no regulation to protect homeowners. He's talking about a John Redwood commission report that Cameron hasn't accepted.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> But he's got some better anti-Tory lines now, which go down well. \"This is no time for a novice,\" he says of George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, although it could also apply to David Miliband.</p> <p>And their plan is to \"to change their appearance to give the appearance of change\".</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> He says the Tories would cut services. Brown fought the last two general elections by attacking the Conservatives for proposing drastic public spending cuts and, on the basis of this speech, he's going to do exactly the same next time.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> And he has a go at the Cameron idea that Britain is \"broken\". \"This country has never been broken by anyone or anything,\" he says. He made a similar point last year, but he's developing it now. Unlike other ministers, he hasn't quoted the Boris Johnson line about Cameron's claim being \"piffle\". Brown's being too serious for that.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.20pm:</strong> He's praising the armed forces now.</p> <p>On to foreign affairs. He will work with partners in the European Union. It's starting to drag, now, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> He tells a moving story about a boy in Rwanda whose last words before being killed were: \"Don't worry, the United Nations will come for us.\"</p> <p>The British people will speak up for the poor around the world.</p> <p>The \"fair society. Fairness at home. Fairness in the world - that's the new settlement for new times.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> That's the key theme, I suppose.</p> <p>He's knows what he believes. It's worth putting up with the attacks and \"the polls\" if he can make life better for just one child, one family.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> \"Because this job is not about me, it's about you.\" Somewhere else in the press room I can hear someone laughing at this line, although it doesn't strike me as that bad. Patrick points out that Obama said something similar.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> Tough times don't weaken his resolve, he says.</p> <p>His peroration is quite moving. He includes the line \"I will not pass by on the other side\", which was at the heart of one of Tony Blair's conference speeches. He wants to \"give of myself for something bigger than myself\".</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.30pm:</strong> It's over. He's now getting the conventional standing ovation. Sarah comes up on stage with him.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Instant Verdict</strong></p> <p><strong>Personality:</strong> Brown's aides promised us a more personal speech than usual, and we got that. I thought Sarah's tribute to him at the start was quite moving, just because her pride and affection for him seems very genuine, and in the very brief line where he thanked her (he didn't say he loved her, of course - he's far too private for that) I got a sense of a deep relationship, which he doesn't display very often. He also used a very effective line about his children: \"My children aren't props, they're people.\" He's never attacked Cameron for exploiting his children like this before, although it's tricky, because you could say exactly the same about Tony Blair. But the anecdote about almost losing his sight didn't work particularly well because he's told the story before, and I don't think this speech will really change the way the public perceive him as a person.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Policy:</strong> The speech was policy-heavy, although there was nothing in it which will have Cameron and the Tories thinking \"Help, how do we match that?\" The most important announcement, I think, was the one about scrapping prescription charges for cancer patients. Scrapping prescription charges for all patients with long-term illnesses will also be popular, although Brown was not clear about when this would happen, or how it will be funded. And I'll be interested to find out more about the decision to make the abolition of child poverty target statutory. What will it mean in practice? Overall, though, there's no game-changer in here.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>The Tories:</strong> There was a lot of effective anti-Tory rhetoric in the speech. Brown clearly doesn't believe that the changes to the Conservative party are anything more than cosmetic, and he geared his party up for a conventional, Brownite \"the Tories will slash spending\" election campaign. I'm not sure how effective this will be. But at least it sounds like he's got the appetite for a fight. His attack on Cameron's \"broken society\" claim was particularly effective (although I do wonder why he hasn't said it in these terms before).</p> <p><strong>Strategy: </strong>In party terms, one of the most important lines was the one where he said that he did not believe in the electoral cycle. In other words, he was telling his party that defeat isn't inevitable. At one point he also mentioned the polls, too, which was interesting; political leaders often don't acknowledge them. But I'm not convinced that his party will believe what he says about the electoral cycle not being inevitable. Didn't he also tell us that boom and bust (ie the economic cycle) was over too?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>Authority: </strong>This is the tricky one. In his speech Brown presented himself as a decent, thoughtful, principled, committed, hard-working servant of the public sector with ideas that could make a tangible difference to the lives of ordinary people. But Labour MPs already knew this was what he was like.They're worried about whether he can \"sell\" Labour to the public. In that sense the speech was workmanlike, rather than inspiring, and I don't think it will cause many Labour MPs to reassess their view of Brown as a leader.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p>Finally, just one health warning. Instant reactions are important. But often it takes a full 24 hours, or more, before people really assess the value of a party conference speech. Make your mind up today. But then think again tomorrow - it might look different.</p>",
  "<p>Amnesty International today urged the US state of Georgia to stop the execution of Troy Davis, who faces death by lethal injection tonight despite doubts over his conviction.</p> <p>Las July, the state's board of pardons and paroles stopped the execution less than 24 hours before it was to be carried out. </p> <p>However, it yesterday rejected pleas to reconsider its recent decision to deny clemency on the grounds that so much uncertainly exists over whether Davis shot and killed a Savannah police officer.</p> <p>Georgia's supreme court also denied Davis's request for a stay of execution, and his last hope of avoiding execution at 7pm local time (midnight BST) now appears to rest with the US supreme court, where his lawyers have asked for a stay of execution.</p> <p>In a case that has attracted international attention, Pope Benedict XVI and the former US president Jimmy Carter have asked for the sentence to be commuted to life in prison without parole. </p> <p>Davis, a 39-year-old African-American, is on death row for the murder of officer Mark MacPhail in 1989, but seven key prosecution witnesses have recanted their testimonies since his 1991 trial and post-trial testimony implicating another man as the gunman has emerged. </p> <p>A \"jailhouse informant\" retracted his incriminating account of Davis' supposed confession, while several other supposed eyewitnesses later took back their trial evidence while insisting they had been under \"a lot of pressure\" from police to provide signed statements. </p> <p>One witness, Antoine Williams, a Burger King employee who identified Davis as the gunman at the trial, later said: \"Even today, I know that I could not honestly identify with any certainty who shot the officer that night. I couldn't then either. </p> <p>\"After the officers talked to me, they gave me a statement and told me to sign it. I signed it. I did not read it because I cannot read.\"</p> <p>Chatham County prosecutors, however, are sure that Davis killed MacPhail, who rushed to a Savannah Burger King car park late at night after hearing the screams of a man who was being pistol-whipped.</p> <p>Prosecutors say that MacPhail, a 27-year-old father of two, was shot down by Davis before he could draw his weapon. They say Davis then stood over the fallen officer and fired again and again.</p> <p>Davis has admitted being at the scene, but has always denied shooting MacPhail. No physical evidence against him has ever been produced, the murder weapon has never been found and the case against him at trial consisted entirely of witness testimony.</p> <p>Georgia's board of pardons says it has extensively studied and considered the case, including hearing from every witness presented by Davis's lawyers, retesting the state's evidence and interviewing Davis himself.</p> <p>\"After an exhaustive review of all available information regarding the Troy Davis case, and after considering all possible reasons for granting clemency, the board has determined that clemency is not warranted,\" a board spokeswoman told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper.</p> <p>Since its resumption of executions in 1977, the US has executed 1,118 prisoners, 42 of them in Georgia. </p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 100 people have been released from death rows around the country, many in cases in which witness testimony has been exposed as unreliable.</p>",
  "<p>Another week, another comedy gem starring the saviour of US light entertainment, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1svBxS7oIE\">Danny McBride</a>. \"Danny McWho?\" I hear you ask, in a tetchy and unnecessarily hostile voice.

Instead, I wondered: \"Are we witnessing the death throes of the mockumentary?\" And, if so, how are low-budget comedy filmmakers supposed to earn a crust now? </p> <p>The mockumentary, with its fake fly-on-the-wall footage, its mensonges dolled up as verit\u00e9, arguably represents the only new genre of the last forty years. Think of some of the defining cultural phenomena in television and cinema and you will eventually hit upon a mockumentary, whether it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/81384/this.is.spinal.tap\">This Is Spinal Tap</a>, The Blair Witch Project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114557/borat\">Borat</a> or TV's The Office. What is it that keeps luring creative types back to this genre like former Big Brother contestants drawn, weekend after weekend, to make PA's at dangerous nightclubs in the Romford area?</p> <p>It could be that, in the post-Watergate, post-Iraq years when we can no longer trust our leaders, the avowed, up-front fraudulence of the mockumentary is the only trustworthy alternative to the manipulative media. Or it might be that the makers of mockumentaries are capitalising on the decline in the integrity of documentarists like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/oct/05/michaelmoore.documentary\">Michael Moore</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/audio/2008/jul/23/britdoc\">Nick Broomfield</a>, who have shown themselves to be partial to the sort of propaganda more commonly found in a Hollywood blockbuster.</p> <p>Undoubtedly the mockumentary has represented the sort of salve we need in an era saturated in media complacency, when the spectre of falsification can strike institutions as venerable as the New York Times and even Richard &amp; Judy's \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAX6yi60OPY\">You Say, We Pay</a>\". If we don't keep a close eye on this kind of corruption, we could very well find, after the votes have been counted at the next general election, that we are facing four years of being governed by Ant and Dec. And if you thought <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSbY_eUfKgM\">Saturday Night Takeaway</a> was bad, you should hear their ideas on corporation tax.</p> <p>Whatever the reason for the rise in mockumentaries, we can be absolutely certain that it has nothing to do with the meagre production costs involved, or the appeal of serving the public what it knows it likes rather than striking out with a unique new format. Nor is it plausible, surely, that generations of underemployed comics have spent too long sitting around in tracksuit bottoms watching boxed sets of The Office and Da Ali G Show until they are surfing a tidal wave of rancour and envy that peaks inevitably with the announcement, \"I could do that!\", delivered to an nearby pet, loved one or bailiff.</p> <p>Some of the most sophisticated movies of the past 40 years have sprung from the mockumentary genre. As well as This Is Spinal Tap and Borat, think of the work of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/woodyallen\">Woody Allen</a> (<a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9402EFDF1439EF3BBC4152DFBE668382679EDE\">Take the Money and Run</a>, Zelig, Husbands and Wives), the Spinal Tap star/co-writer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2007/jan/28/awardsandprizes.comedy\">Christopher Guest</a> (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/86379/best.in.show\">Best In Show</a>, A Mighty Wind), not to mention The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash or Harry Enfield's rather lovely faux-South Bank Show special, Norbert Smith - A Life, which featured the only recorded example we have of Melvyn Bragg exhibiting a sense of humour about himself. Elsewhere in TV, series like The Larry Sanders Show, Brass Eye, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge, The Thick Of It and the current <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Heights_High\">Summer Heights High</a> all have significant traces of the mockumentary formula in their DNA.</p> <p>But has the format run its course? An entire genre cannot be killed off by one under-written, over-praised film like The Foot Fist Way using its conventions to score easy laughs at tired stereotypes. But when a creative style is over-exposed or botched, as it is in that movie and others, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/112197/confetti\">Confetti</a>, The Big Tease, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Mike Bassett: England Manager and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122527/walk.hard\">Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story</a>, it can easily shade into meaningless clich\u00e9. And if you will forgive me for shooting from the hip and calling a spade a spade, I'm sure we can all agree we need meaningless clich\u00e9s like a hole in the head.</p>",
  "<p>Plans for a culture change in NHS hospitals to put patients and visitors in the frontline of the battle against MRSA superbugs will be disclosed tomorrow by Alan Johnson, the health secretary.</p> <p>He will tell the Labour party conference in Manchester that patients and relatives can do more to remind doctors and nurses of their duty to maintain high standards of cleanliness.</p> <p>The Patients Association and National Patients Safety Agency will develop \"top tips\" on infection control to inform people about what NHS staff should be doing to improve hygiene and how they should be challenged if they fail down on the job.</p> <p>Johnson is expected to say: \"In the mid-1990s, infection rates rocketed in understaffed, dilapidated hospitals. Last week I announced that we had succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/19/mrsa.nhs\">cutting MRSA rates</a> by 57% [since 2004].</p> <p>\"Our focus on this problem continues. Soon I will be setting out the details of a new public campaign which is aimed at patient empowerment. We want people to have a broader understanding of infections and feel able to ask staff whether they have washed their hands or not.\"</p> <p>Johnson will say the proposed NHS constitution gives patients responsibilities as well as rights. These should include high standards of personal hygiene to avoid bringing infections on to a hospital ward and constant vigilance to check on the cleanliness of NHS staff.</p> <p>The Department of Health will work with Ashley Brooks, a businessman who has survived a hospital-acquired infection. Brooks launched a campaign to get patients more involved in infection control.</p> <p>The Patients Association is also developing top tips for patients and visitors. Johnson will commit \u00a3500,000 to support these campaigns.</p> <p>The Health Protection Agency last week reported 836 cases of MRSA bloodstream infections between April and June - a 14% decrease on the previous three months and a drop of 36% from the same quarter last year.</p> <p>The government said that since 2004, MRSA infections had dropped by 57%.</p> <p>Peter Borriello, director of the agency's centre for infections, warned that continued attention was needed. \"The next challenge will be to move to a position of zero tolerance,\" he said.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/18/gordonbrown.nhs\">Gordon Brown wrote to all healthcare staff</a> to thank them for their efforts. He admitted that some of the imposed initiatives, from the deep-cleaning of wards to the recent bare-below-the-elbows policy had been controversial, but he told staff: \"I am pleased that they have helped you make the progress that you have.\"</p> <p>At the Labour conference tomorrow, Johnson will also announce plans to award a kitemark to NHS trusts that meet the highest hygiene standards.</p> <p>David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, is working with the British Standards Institute to develop tight specifications for hospital cleaning. The Care Quality Commission that is due to take over inspection of health and social care in April will assess how well trusts perform.</p>",
  "<p>After months of disingenuous talk about bipartisanship and rising above politics, Democrats and Republicans, in Congress and on the presidential trail, seemed suddenly united - in their distrust of the White House's $700bn bailout plan, and their confusion as to how to play the issue to their advantage. </p> <p>Both John McCain and Barack Obama have condemned the notion of giving a \"blank cheque\" for the US treasury to buy up debt, and last night Democrats circulated a counterproposal that would impose far more limits on how the bailout would operate, including a crackdown on Wall Street salaries and a provision to route some of any government profits from the scheme into affordable housing schemes. </p> <p>Eventually, both presidential candidates, being senators, will have to vote on one or more versions of the plan. The closer it remains to its current form, the easier it will be for McCain to oppose it, helping him distance himself from the Bush administration and burnish his populist credentials. Obama, meanwhile, will need to balance populist opposition to the White House proposal with the need to show he's committed to finding a way through the crisis. </p> <p>Even more importantly, any eventual bailout will surely severely constrain the eventual winner's room for manoeuvre in his first years as president. \"The default position of the tone of the campaign has been pettiness and small-mindedness, lipstick and Britney,\" <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/22/new_realities_will_scuttle_cam.html?hpid=topnews\">wrote Dan Balz in the Washington Post</a>. \"Events, however, keep reminding voters that these are extraordinary times. Will the candidates rise to meet those challenges, not just when one of them takes the oath next January, but in the final weeks of this incredible campaign?\"<br> Maybe. There wasn't much sign of that yesterday, when senior McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt launched what was, even by contemporary Republican standards, an extraordinary attack on the media, picking <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/us/politics/23times.html?ref=politics\">in particular on the New York Times</a>. The paper reported that Rick Davis, McCain's campaign manager, had been paid more than $30,000 per month in an earlier job working for a group seeking to limit government regulation of US mortgage lenders. </p> <p>\"There is no level of public vetting with regard to Senator Obama's record, his background, his past statements. There is no level of outrage directed at his deceitful ads. This is an organisation that is completely, totally, 150% in the tank for the Democrat candidate,\" Schmidt said in a media conference call. When Ben Smith, a reporter for the newspaper and website Politico, asked Schmidt to back up several of the factually dubious claims he'd made in the call, he refused. Instead, he told Smith: \"You're in the tank.\" </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>John McCain and Sarah Palin arrive at the UN General Assembly meeting today, where Palin will be introduced to several world leaders, and Henry Kissinger; Barack Obama heads to Florida to prepare for Friday's debate. </p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>The candidates' positions in the four main tracking polls are largely unchanged; when they're averaged and weighted, Obama leads McCain 48% to 44%. The week's modest improvement in Obama's fortunes has not been matched in battleground states, where things remain static: in <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/fox_rasmussen_polling/fox_rasmussen_swing_state_polling_september_21_2008\">Rasmussen polls</a>, McCain leads in Florida, Ohio and - just - in Virginia, Obama in Pennsylvania and Michigan. </p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/deadlineusa/2008/sep/23/youngeamerica.gayissues\">Gary Younge video: Don't get wedged by gay marriage</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/23/barack.obama.campaign.soundtrack\">Barack Obama to release official campaign soundtrack</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/uselections2008.barackobama\">Obama makes move into the conservative deep South</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/uselections2008.sarahpalin\">Inexperienced Palin swots up on diplomacy with busy UN visit</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-bailout-plan-welcome_b_128450.html\">Arianna Huffington: Welcome to economic shock and awe</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/23/business/23skeptics.html?hp\">New York Times: Experts see need for punitive action in bailout</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dns6oX4p98\">Bill Clinton: Hillary didn't want to be Obama's running mate</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=paulsons_folly\">The American Prospect: Paulson's folly</a></p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Whatever the New York Times once was, it is today, not by any standard a journalistic organization.

I didn't know we did it and if I had anything to do with it, we would have never done it\": Joe Biden veers entirely off message on CBS, condemning an Obama ad mocking John McCain's techno-illiteracy.

  "<p>Is rugby union careering down football's slippery slope? All the warning signs are there for those who care to look. In the past four days alone we have had Premiership coaches accused of influencing referees; the latest flare-up in the age-old club versus country debate; England's star player stirring up a tabloid frenzy and the increasingly likely prospect of Bath moving to Swindon Town FC. \"There is no doubt in my mind that, whether we like it or not, rugby will go the same way as soccer,\" warned the Saracens' chairman Nigel Wray, suggesting only the rich would ultimately be able to compete with Europe's elite.</p> <p>Some will shrug their shoulders and wonder why anyone is remotely bothered. Footballers' wages are not to be sneezed at and off-shore investment is already a fact of life in English club rugby, not least at Saracens and London Irish. If rugby can sell its product to Sky for millions more than is currently the case, everyone should be happy, right? And what's the problem with Swindon when Bristol Rovers, Wycombe Wanderers, Stockport County, Reading and Watford already host Premiership rugby? On the head, son, you know you want to.</p> <p>So why the creeping sense of unease? It has nothing to do with pining for the old amateur days. There is no desire to see players revert to the status of feudal underlings, even if the genuine entertainers and characters are starting to thin out to a worrying degree. It is simply a sense that, by meekly following the football blueprint, rugby is in danger of missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to plough its own singular furrow and retain an unique identity, the essence of every successful new business.</p> <p>This may well be a rubbish analogy but let's compare sport to confectionery. Football is the chewing gum of the masses, capable of providing instant satisfaction yet too often ending in sticky aggravation. Rugby league is a bit like a Marathon; they call it a Snickers nowadays but floating voters still have a love-hate relationship with it. And professional club rugby union? Currently it resembles Green and Black's chocolate: a high-quality success story in danger of selling its soul and, in doing so, of losing its raison d'etre. If rugby union ends up being staged in segregated football stadiums, between teams wearing vomit-inducing fluorescent shirts, with a dumbed-down set of laws that render different nationalities almost indistinguishable, it can hardly complain if its core audience decides it is seen enough and defects to a more rewarding weekend pastime.</p> <p>The next couple of years, therefore, are vital. Never mind the cash-strapped southern hemisphere, the British game cannot afford another debilitating series of rows over player availability; either the impoverished Scottish Rugby Union will have to strike some kind of deal with Premier Rugby for the use of its exiled club players outside international weeks, as the Rugby Football Union has belatedly done, or risk alienating a public already lukewarm to the concept of paying to watch professional rugby. The International Board must also dismount its high horse occasionally and work more closely with the clubs for the collective good; if that means a slight reduction in the number of Test matches that need not necessarily be a bad thing.</p> <p>And if rugby wants a half-decent case study to ponder it should resist football's siren call and take a glance halfway across the globe. Australian rugby may be operating on shifting sands but, coincidentally, Australian Rules football has many of the attributes European club rugby should aspire to. In Melbourne they are awaiting this weekend's grand final between Hawthorn and Geelong with a fervour that makes the Ryder Cup resemble a vicarage tea party. It is no longer just a game for Victorians. The international dimension, admittedly, is barely discernible but even rugby league-led Sydney is increasingly keen. Attend a big game and the first thing you notice, in contrast to British soccer, is the warm family atmosphere. It is parochial yet big time, deeply serious yet fun to attend. Even the ball is an acceptable shape. The AFL is structured and run in a way which makes it make it hard for one or two clubs to dominate in perpetuity and the crowds, partially as a result of affordable ticket prices, are huge. No wonder the ARU is worried.</p> <p>The business model, clearly, is more complex in Europe, particularly given the largely unfettered financial clout of the big French clubs. Nor is anyone suggesting that all rugby players should wear tank tops or that the IRB should do away with crossbars from January 1. But rugby union, contrary to popular belief, is still in control its own destiny. An acquaintance went to see Fulham and Harlequins play on successive weekends last season and could hardly believe how much more he and his son enjoyed their day at the more welcoming, inclusive Twickenham Stoop. If rugby wants to ape football's every move, fine. Before its rulers head down that dispiriting route, however, they should at least pause to weigh up the alternatives.</p> <h2>Trying stuff</h2> <p>Three rounds of Guinness Premiership league matches gone and already some intriguing themes are surfacing. So far there have been only two try bonus points scored in 18 games, the exceptions to the general rule coming at the expense of the two weakest teams, Bristol and Newcastle. Sale are second in the table on points difference having scored just one try in 240 minutes and conceded none. It is fair to say the ELVs are not encouraging a free-wheeling frenzy of attacking rugby.</p> <h2> Exiles on Main Street</h2> <p>You may have spotted that The Guardian is now publishing a collated \"team of the weekend\" from the Premiership. It is a subjective exercise, clearly, and for some reason we managed to list Bath's Michael Lipman as playing for Saracens in Monday's paper. For practical reasons, too, it is not yet possible to incorporate the Celtic League into the selection process. Looking down our first weekend XV, something else is immediately apparent. Of the 15 names chosen, there were only four English-qualified players. It will be interesting to see if that meagre ratio is maintained or was merely a blip.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>11.30 AM:</strong> We tried, we failed. It seems impossible to <a href=\"http://www.michaelmoore.com/\">download</a> Slacker Uprising without being resident in the US or Canada. The reason? Moore <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/05/michaelmoore.slackeruprising\">intends the film</a> to be a hearty pep talk for those young folks who might be tempted to find something better to do than vote come election day. </p> <p>Slacker Uprising documents Moore's 62 stop tour round swing states in the run-up to the 2004 election. Presumably Moore's thinking is that he failed that time round because he just didn't reach the ears of enough people. This, then, is the chance to have a date with Moore in your very own bedroom, so to speak. But will it be a happy experience?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>11.35 AM:</strong> First off the block is <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Slacker-Uprising-3375.html\">Cinema Blend</a>, who ain't impressed. </p> <p>\"It's little more than a collection of rally videos,\" writes Josh Tyler, who compares the experience of watching it to sitting through someone's holiday slides - \"assuming the person in question's idea of a vacation is attending Democratic political rallies\". </p> <p>\"Mostly, what we're watching is Michael Moore wander across the United States being cheered,\" Tyler concludes. The feeling here seems to be that Slacker Uprising hasn't been released online just through generosity but tact too: there simply isn't enough here to justify a cinema release. </p> <p>Cinema Blend give it one and a half stars out of five: we'll try and tot these ratings up as they come in and give you a median (maths permitting).</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>11.55 AM:</strong> Next up is Mlive.com (\"Everything Michigan\"). Jenn McKee looks to be similarly underwhelmed. She points out that there's not a lot of tension watching the run up to the 2004 election. In fact, it might well be a bit sad - \"since those who agree with Moore's politics will be the ones who see this movie ... it will likely be hard for some to revisit and relive that time\". </p> <p>She doesn't much like the songs either (they \"bog down the pace\"), though she is among the few people on earth who actually reckon Mike is something of a wag (she likes his fake ads for George W Bush). No star rating, but if I were Jenn, I'd think she'd give it 2 1/2.</p> <!-- Block 4 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TJEtX9m2J8k?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/TJEtX9m2J8k&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/TJEtX9m2J8k&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>12.25 PM:</strong> Just watched the trailer. It's noisy and egocentric and incredibly weird: apparently recasting Moore's tour as some sort of victory rally. Roseanne makes a brief appearance.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.35 PM:</strong> All gone slightly quiet. Had a look at the tour photos on Mike's website. Especially like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartmovie/2845909569/in/set-72157607220675587/\">this one</a>. Something about the ferns.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1.10 PM:</strong> Still a bit tumbleweedy. But then it is only 8am in New York and 5am in Los Angeles, and I suppose it'd be rather unslackerish to have already woken, downloaded, digested, reviewed and uploaded.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1.20 PM:</strong> On the wall for the enthusiastic SU Facebook group<br>a man from London has protested about not being able to download it this side of the pond: \"How can you have a copyright on something that is being distributed for free?\" Sounds fine to me - presumably Radiohead still own the In Rainbows copyright. Anyway, makes you wonder how much someone might actually pay for the thing? And does it make you less keen to get your hands on something they're giving away for free?</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1.35 PM:</strong> To some extent it seems Slacker Uprising is, in fact, a craftily repackaged version of Captain Mike Across America, which premiered in Toronto earlier this year. In that form at least it got a few reviews, generally pretty ambivalent. <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934650.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0\">Joe Deydon of Variety</a> liked the scrappy, road movie vibe but was unconvinced by the concert-with-speeches format. \"In its current form ... this repetitious and self-indulgent hodgepodge comes across as a nostalgia-drenched vanity project, with far too much footage of various celebs at assorted gatherings introing Moore as the greatest thing since sliced bread. Theatrical potential is slim, but grassroots circulation of DVDs might prove useful in get-out-the-vote drives for 2008.\" Have Mike and co just taken Joe's advice? Or have they tweaked more than just the title?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.15 PM:</strong> A nice email from Emma in Sweden. \"Dear Catherine, I don't want to be rude, but I think the correct year of the Toronto premiere of Captain Mike Across America is 2007. Anyway, great idea for a blog!\" Thanks Emma - how depressing that I'd assumed it was this year, how depressing to have your suspicions confirmed that Slacker Uprising is just money for old rope presented as a wonderful gift to the nation. Oh well.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.35 PM:</strong> Hmm. Judging by the overwhelming silence among bloggers lucky enough to be able to click the \"Yes I live in the US or Canada\" and not be lying through their fingers, Moore's movie isn't setting the electorate alight just yet. </p> <p>In lieu of them, let's have some wise words from Stephanie Zacharek at Salon, who summed up Captain Mike Across America as \"a 102-minute commercial for himself, which possibly has been his dream all along\". She also aired the word \"tumbleweed\" in relation to the film - about 50 people showed up to the press screening in Toronto, apparently: \"Could it be that Moore's dud logic and relentless self-congratulation are finally starting to grind down even those who essentially agree with his politics?\"</p> <p>Yup, it seems.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.00 PM:</strong> More Moore is less popular than he was a while back evidence comes to light. When Mike made an appearance to showcase Slacker Uprising at Michigan Theatre last Thursday, he wasn't exactly mobbed, despite some <a href=\"http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2008/09/michael_moore_in_ann_arbor.html\">enthusiastic captioning</a>.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.35 PM:</strong> Gordon, an ex-pat now living in Washington, has emailed through an actual, real-life, living, breathing review.</p> <p>\"I was excited to see this thinking mistakenly that it was an extension of Michael's Election Guide book. Turns out that it's a guided tour through the final few weeks of the last election, a time that I have little need to relive again. Thankfully you can fast forward through a lot of it which I did, so perhaps my opinion is not particularly well informed. </p> <p>The songs do seem a little hollow now that we know the actual result although Eddie Vedder does a remarkably good Cat Stevens impression at one point and I mean that in a nice way. </p> <p>Overall I think it will just be too depressing to most of Moore's audience, it certainly would have harmed my opinion of him if I had been charged nine bucks to sit through it at the local cineplex. I think he must know that there was never much chance of a theatrical release in this one.</p> <p>I suspect it was originally conceived to be his triumphant documentary about how he managed to swing the election by electrifying the young voters of America. Bush won and spoiled it for him (and of course for every one else ultimately).\"</p> <p>Excellent point I think - presumably this was intended to be a trumpet blowing chronicle of how it was Mike wot won it for the Democrats. And this is not a man to let facts stand in the way of a damn good story.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4.50 PM:</strong> The reviews are flooding in now - well, trickling gently at least. And here's a moderately positive one, from \"Peter\", who was actually at Ann Arbor screening I was sniffy about earlier. He confirms that yes, the queues really were round the block - in fact such was demand that there had to be two screenings.</p> <p>\"MM came on and spoke for about 30-40 mins; admittedly it wasn't a great speech, a bit rambling, but he was entertaining and really got the crowd going. Sure, the film isn't his usual scalpel-to-the-jugular style. It's more of a chronicle of what he did last time which didn't work, so he's saying get out the vote and make sure it doesn't happen again. It is rather insubstantial, <br>but should make a good rallying point for the troops.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5.05 PM:</strong> And our own Ben Walters has filed a review, too, which you can read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/23/review.slackeruprising\">here</a>. </p> <p>It's a two star job, that takes the film to task for its flimsiness. \"It offers no argument whatsoever,\" says Ben, \"just a lot of shots of Moore's name on digital marquees and his face preaching to the choir\".</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6.10 PM:</strong> Wes from Leeds emails in pointing out that there might, possibly, be ways to get round the US only download clause. He's \"very keen\" to see the film. \"When holidaying in the States a few years ago (6 months after 9/11) me &amp; my g/f went to see Michael talk in a church in L.A. and he was great (although, admittedly I was more excited to see <a href=\"http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/6746/elpeladohj8.jpg\">Clarence Boddicker</a> in the front row!)\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6.25 PM:</strong> Well, I'm off in a minute, but thanks to all of you who've emailed in - keep em coming and we'll update this first thing tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9.35am:</strong> Morning. Well, it got - not quite busy, but certainly busier, overnight. </p> <p>Barbara from Colorado emailed in with an interesting take, calling the film a \"cyber rally\" and, as such a success. Complacency is a dangerous thing, she warns: new voters who were just 14 in 2004 will need reminding what happened the last time. See if you can try and guess her politics from this review: </p> <p>\"I just viewed Slacker Uprising and I liked it. The critics who are complaining that it isn't terribly innovative or surprising are missing the point. Michael Moore isn't the usual filmmaker; he's an activist who happens to use documentaries for his activism. </p> <p>Slacker Uprising is even less a typical documentary than his previous ones. I doubt if it was ever really conceived to be released in theatres. Instead, it's being released free, online, only a week or two before the first mail-in ballots arrive at our homes, before the first votes are cast. (And I've been told that here in Colorado, about 70% of registered voters are registered as \"absentee\" voters, to get the mail-in ballots. That's because in Colorado it's <br>the only way we can make certain that our votes have a paper trail and can be recounted if necessary, rather than disappearing into an electronic voting machine's black hole.)</p> <p>Moore is offering this as a cyber-rally for <em>this</em> election. He's <br>reminding us how angry we were four years ago, and that our work then was left unfinished, and that we've had to wait four years to complete it. And he's helping the youngest, first-time voters a chance to catch up. (Four years is a lifetime in the U.S. memory, and people will be voting this time who were only 14 last time.)</p> <p>As a cyber-rally, the film is a success. The cheering crowds, the musical numbers, the few and blank-eyed right-wing counter-demonstrators who only damage their cause, it's what one expects, and it works. (As a classical hotel lobby musician, I'm delighted to hear the theme from \"Finlandia\" used as a sort of anti-nationalist people's anthem. I'll be playing it every day until Nov. 5.) And in the background throughout the whole film is the unspoken thought: THIS is how energized people were getting even BEFORE Obama! What can't we accomplish with him at the helm?</p> <p>There is suspense through the film. It's us wondering how Moore will handle the '04 defeat at the film's end in a way that will motivate people to work for this election, rather than just be discouraged into paralysis. Moore handles it by pointing out that the hotly contested Tallahassee Florida vote was in fact won by Dems, and that Ohio was lost by a tiny percentage. And as Moore says, the young people voted for Kerry in a landslide; it's just that their parents voted for Bush. With more older people turning to Obama, it's implied, this time we'll do it. We just can't take anything for granted, but we'll do it.</p> <p>...<br> I keep reading critics describing Moore as egocentric, but I can't see that at all. He's happy to have the spotlight, but he's always using that publicity for the political and social justice he's devoted his life to. His website isn't about him; he uses people's interest in him to guide them towards other activists and towards action. His Oscar acceptance speech wasn't about him; it was about ending the war. And this film, however much he and his name appear <br>in it, isn't about him. It's about getting the unholy cabal of corrupt plutocrats and psychopathic religious zealots out of power in Washington, D.C., and helping Obama save our country. Wish us luck, and help us out if you can.\"</p> <p>Yikes! Even a rebuttal of egocentrism! I think that's a four-and-a-half starrer.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>9.50am:</strong> On the other side of the coin, Tom writes in to suggest that the Automotive State may have bred more than its fair share of egomaniacs:</p> <p>\"I hate to admit this, but I was born 35 miles up the road from [Moore] in Saginaw. Michigan does seem to produce a few people with a rather inflated estimation of themselves - Madonna comes to mind. One of the seminal pieces of research to come from Michigan was \"The Three Christs of Ypsilanti\" - Ypsi being one of our old mental institutions.

Sure the production values aren't there. There are no cute radical cartoons, or how-the-hell-did-he-land-that-guest interviews and the video quality leave much to be desired. But you shouldn't care about this. Because one does not go into a Michael Moore movie like one goes into a Michael Bay movie. This documentary is about the message as are all of Moore's movies.</p> <p>Slacker Uprising doesn't rock the vote, it propels it sky high. Moore's dry wit isn't lost in the production since straight from the credit he calls his mission a failure; a failure in 2004 maybe, but not in 2008. Slacker Uprising is a direct visitation upon that old Machiavellian rule of power; those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Only this advice is not for the candidate but rather for the voters as Michael tries whole heartedly to get a young generation to vote for the first time.</p> <p>Many critics have already shitcanned this movie for being an exercise in self-aggrandizement and narcissism on the part of Moore. But then how else will the media react to someone who told them they were tools of the republican propaganda war-machine? The documentary does heavily focus on Moore but this serves only to mirror the behavior of a nation divided on issues. Moore is only the echo of a nation torn up by a failed government and its failed policies.

  "<p>A Labour party conference fringe meeting about gangs and knife crime was held at the local Comedy Store in Manchester. Not funny, I know. Less funny was the meagre turnout: only a dozen or so adults in attendance, most from the youth work field, plus me, your lone reporter. The remainder were teenagers, beneficiaries of a scheme called <a href=\"http://www.kidscount.org.uk/\">Kids Count</a>, which operates across London and the south-east of England. Among the panellists was the MP <a href=\"http://www.vernon-coaker-mp.co.uk/\">Vernon Coaker</a> from a Labour Home Office that has brought you Asbos, databases about children that do more harm than good and enough vapid \"tough\" talk to keep you in spit for a hundred years. It didn't look promising.</p> <p>So, we all make mistakes. The first to speak from the platform was the children's commissioner Sir Al Aynsley-Green who had his suitcase (literally) packed for Geneva where he'll hear the UN ask our government to account for its poor adherence to the rights of children. On the radio yesterday morning, I heard Martin Narey of Barnados reveal evidence of our enthusiasm for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/22/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation\">locking up 12-year-olds</a> when everyone who knows anything about most 12-year-olds like those knows there are better ways to set them straight. </p> <p>Sir Al closed by producing his mobile and pressing a button. \"Hands up who could hear that?\" Only the teenagers could. He'd demonstrated the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/feb/10/children.police\">\"mosquito\" deterrent</a>, a device for making groups of kids gathered on street corners so uncomfortable that they move on. Three and a half thousand have been installed in Britain, he said, including some by private householders. This is what it's come to, he explained. Meanwhile, teens wander Darlington and Devon wishing grown-ups would show more interest in them.</p> <p>Then came some grown-ups who do precisely that. The son of Ann Oakes-Odgers was knifed to death next to a cash machine in an unprovoked attack. She has since devoted herself to educating youngsters in schools across Essex where she lives not to do the same to someone else. Jennifer Blake runs a project in Peckham, south London. A former street tearaway herself, she moves among gang members in her neighbourhood, mediating, persuading, demanding that they chose not to intimidate and kill. </p> <p>These people are not \"soft\". They know that law enforcement is part of the remedy. They know also that the stuff that really counts is the educating, the diverting, the broadening of horizons among kids who rarely travel, physically or psychologically, beyond the boundaries of their home postcodes. Next up, a young woman called Pariss. A Kids Count success story, she told her own tale of a desperate family life and adolescence from which she was helped to escape. She was nervous. She was outstanding. She was, too, living vindication of the rescue work inspired and committed youth work can do. </p> <p>Why can't there be more \u2013 much more \u2013 of this? Coaker was the last to speak and I'm still a little worried that I was too impressed by what he said. We in the government haven't \"got a grip\" on what kinds of organisations get results; we're researching that now and when we've figured it out we need to back these people \"for the long term and leave them alone\"; we need to accept that this may mean that sometimes things will go wrong, but we should stick to the policy anyway. </p> <p>He recalled his father, a policeman, telling him that it was easy to bring an audience to its feet by calling for \"tough\" measures on youth crime that don't work, but if you suggested doing something useful instead, you might get booed. \"We need to be braver,\" Coaker said. I felt a powerful urge to stand up and cheer. I wish the minister's bosses had moved me more often in that way these past few years.</p>",
  "<p>Today sees the launch of the latest <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi\">corruption perceptions index</a> from Transparency International. The index is closely watched by governments, politicians and businesses around the world, and gives the best available impression of which governments are perceived to be most corrupt. The UK's score has dropped from 8.4 last year to 7.7 \u2013 the lowest score for the UK since the Index started in 1995.</p> <p>It is probably no surprise that the UK's score has dropped sharply this year. Apart from the continuing concerns about corruption in domestic politics \u2013 from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4812822.stm\">cash-for-honours</a> to MP's expenses \u2013 the UK has a woeful record in enforcing the 1997 OECD <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/department/0,2688,en_2649_34859_1_1_1_1_1,00.html\">anti-bribery convention</a>, which outlaws the bribery of foreign public officials. This was epitomised by the dropping of the investigation into BAE Systems' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bae\">Saudi Arabian defence contracts</a>. Whereas the US has had 105 prosecutions since the convention entered into force and France has had 19, the UK has had precisely one. </p> <p>This suggests two things. First, the UK government is not serious about fighting international corruption despite its rhetoric. Secondly, UK anti-corruption law is not fit for purpose.</p> <p>The government now faces an uncomfortable ride over the autumn. In October, an influential OECD working group will be publishing an official report on how well the UK is complying with the anti-bribery convention. And in November, the Law Commission will publish long-awaited proposals for a new anti-corruption bill. This is the second time in a decade that the commission has been asked to undertake this task. </p> <p>Transparency International's index not an academic exercise. A poor rating on the index can have significant ramifications for countries. UK businesses that are serious about an anti-corruption culture will find it more difficult to convince their overseas staff that they mean it. It will also be harder for them to resist demands for bribes from corrupt public officials. But perhaps most problematic is that it makes it much less convincing for the UK to suggest to other countries, particularly in Africa, that they need to clean up their acts.</p> <p>In the longer term, a poor reputation on corruption goes hand in hand with increased investment risk ratings, which can deter inward investment and raise the cost of capital. </p> <p>This situation need never have happened, if an effective anti-corruption law had been passed when the UK signed up to the OECD anti-bribery convention. It is not too late to change, but if the UK's reputation is to be salvaged, the government needs to act quickly and decisively. The worst outcome would be for the government to postpone new anti-corruption legislation in the face of other priorities \u2013 and therefore potentially for several years if an election intervenes. The anti-corruption spotlight will be firmly on the UK between now and Christmas.</p>",
  "<p>The results of more than half of all clinical trials that demonstrate the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/drugs\">safety and effectiveness of new drugs</a> are not published within five years of the drug going on the market, according to an analysis of 90 drugs approved by US regulators between 1998 and 2000.</p> <p>The researchers, who traced the publication or otherwise of 909 separate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/medicalresearch\">clinical trials</a> in the scientific literature, wrote that the failure of drug companies to publish the evidence relating to new medicines amounted to \"scientific misconduct\". They said it \"harms the public good\" by preventing informed decisions by doctors and patients about new medicines and by hampering future scientific work.</p> <p>Sir Iain Chalmers, who is director of the James Lind Library in Oxford and a founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, a respected organisation that reviews medical evidence, said that it was vital that all data on new medicines be made public. </p> <p>\"Patients may otherwise suffer or die unnecessarily,\" said Chalmers, who was not involved in the work. \"The people who participate in a trial have a right to expect that their participation and their data will be made available publicly so that people can take whatever decisions seem appropriate in the light of that information.\" </p> <p>The US researchers who carried out the study searched the academic literature for publication of the trials that drug companies relied on to convince the US Food and Drug Administration that their new products were safe and effective and so worthy of market approval. </p> <p>Information that is used to convince the regulators is not necessarily subsequently published for public and scientific scrutiny, but the scale of the missing information was found to be vast.</p> <p>Five years after each of the 90 drugs was first available for patients, only 43% of the studies supporting the drugs' use had been published, with most publication happening in the first one or two years. In the case of one product \u2013 an antibiotic \u2013 the researchers could not find a single supporting trial in the scientific literature, while five trials were published twice and one was published three times. </p> <p>The team also found evidence for a \"publication bias\". Trials with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those with non-significant results, as were those with larger sample sizes.</p> <p>\"In the years immediately following FDA approval that are most relevant to public health, there exists incomplete and selective publication of trials supporting approved new drugs,\" <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/482las\">Prof Ida Sim and her colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in the journal PLoS Medicine</a>.</p> <p>One possible explanation for the scientific data not being published is that drug companies hold back publication of the results that are least flattering to their new drugs. Another possibility is that academic journal editors are less inclined to publish papers on trials that have negative or ambiguous results.</p> <p>\"Regardless of the cause, publication bias harms the public good by impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to make informed clinical decisions, and the ability of scientists to design safer and more efficient trials based on past findings,\" the authors wrote. \"Publication bias can thus be considered a form of scientific misconduct.\"</p> <p>The reporting of clinical trial results should have improved since the period analysed by the researchers, because the 2007 FDA Amendments Act mandated basic results reporting for all trials supporting FDA-approved drugs and devices. However, the researchers said it remained to be seen whether clinical reporting would improve.</p> <p>The new law could even have the opposite effect. \"Might sponsors feel less compelled to publish equivocal trials because the basic results will already be in the public domain?\" they speculated.</p>",

  "<p>Campaigners for age equality today lost a key stage in their legal battle to banish the compulsory retirement age in the UK.</p> <p>Age Concern had gone to the European court of justice in Luxembourg to argue that compelling people to stop work at or after 65 without compensation breaches EU equality requirements.</p> <p>However the charity's claim was rejected by the advocate-general. </p> <p>Today's legal opinion is a blow to hundreds of people forced to retire against their wishes who are claiming compensation through UK employment tribunals.</p> <p>The case, which was taken by Age Concern's membership arm Heyday, was referred to the European court two years ago.</p> <p>If the campaigners had won, hundreds of workers who had been forced to retire at 65 would have been able to claim compensation from their former employers.</p> <p>Around 260 cases are on hold in tribunals awaiting the outcome of the Age Concern test case, and thousands more claims could have followed from pensioners forced to retire against their will.</p> <p>The director of Age Concern, Gordon Lishman, said the decision was \"a set back, but ... not a disaster\".</p> <p>\"The advocate -general's opinion confirms that the EU directive requires age discrimination to be justified,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It's now up to the UK government to prove to the high court that their social and employment policies are important enough to justify kicking people out of work at 65.\"</p> <h2>Discriminating circumstances</h2> <p>Lawyers for Age Concern told a hearing earlier this year that the UK Employment Equality (Age) Regulations breach the EU's Equal Treatment Directive, which bans employment discrimination on the grounds of, among other things, age.</p> <p>Introduced in 2006, the UK Regulations do ban discrimination on the grounds of age. Older workers have the right to ask if they can stay on beyond 65, but employers are not obliged to agree. Pensioners can be dismissed at 65 without redundancy payments, or at the employer's mandatory retirement age if it is above 65. </p> <p>But the advocate-general Jan Marzak has now argued that a fixed retirement age is not necessarily contrary to EU rules.</p> <p>Government lawyers insisted the exception was a matter for national rules, and the situation of retirement-age workers should not be governed by the EU Directive.</p> <p>In today's legal opinion, Marzak agreed with Age Concern that UK rules on mandatory retirement are covered by the EU Directive. But he made clear that discrimination on grounds of age could be justified in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Allowing employers to force employees to retire aged 65 or over \"can in principle be justified if that rule is objectively and reasonably justified in the context of national law by a legitimate aim relating to employment policy and the labour market, and it is not apparent that the means put in place to achieve that aim of public interest are inappropriate and unnecessary for the purpose\".</p> <p>Today's opinion is not legally binding, but is followed by the EU judges in about 80% of cases. The final verdict is due in about six months.</p> <h2>Grossly unfair</h2> <p>Ailsa Olgive, director of Heyday, said that if the European Court confirmed today's opinion the case would then have to go back to the high court in London for a final decision. </p> <p>\"We hope the high court would not want to remove the choice for people to work in later life if they wish to or if they need to,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Denying people work because of their date of birth is grossly unfair, and in these tough times we expect more people will need to carry on working into 'retirement' in order to make ends meet.\"</p> <p>The CBI said the advocate-general's opinion showed \"a sensible and fair approach to this issue\".</p> <p>The group's director of employment, Katja Hall, said the UK had one of the highest employment rates of older workers in Europe and surveys had shown that 80% of requests for postponed retirement made by workers last year had been granted. </p> <p>\"Companies value the skills and experience that older staff bring to the workplace, and want to treat them well,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Employees already have the right to request postponement of retirement - and this right is working well.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Losing the ability to retire people at 65 could lead to unintended consequences, with employers less inclined to take on older workers and forced to dismiss on grounds of poor performance at an earlier stage.\"</p>",

  "<p>As the economic crisis deepens, the worsening state of the environment is predictably losing prominence in politics, the media and public debate. It always happens: when times are good, green is good. When times get tough, out goes the green stuff.</p> <p>This time, however, it is different. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/23/climatechange.carboncapturestorage\">science has moved on</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climatechange\">Climate change</a> is no longer a matter of speculation and no longer can it be seen as a long-term concern to be ignored while we deal with more pressing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/globaleconomy\">economic shocks</a>: although that is what could easily happen. <br> But, instead of making the usual predictable trade-offs, a new approach could be taken \u2013 one that joins up the need to cope with the impacts of peak oil and climate change, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/22/oil.climatechange\">kickstarting the economy</a>. A unique opportunity has presented itself, to tame and control the financial system in order to put it at the service of our society; to set us on a more sustainable, secure and fairer trajectory.<br> This is not so much a technical policymaking challenge but a test of our political leaders' willingness to confront the ideological consensus of deregulated finance and small government that they have become used to defending and promoting at every turn.  In the present crisis, however, there is a huge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">opportunity to do things differently</a>, through governments taking control of the economy and by spending money \u2013 large amounts of it \u2013 to stimulate economic activity, cut our reliance on imported fossil fuels and slash climate-changing emissions. By spending now to build a low-carbon economy, we could generate a new army of highly skilled green-collar workers, building new power infrastructure, transport networks and super efficient buildings. <br> This new \"carbon army\" could help reverse the job losses taking place across the economy, including in the financial sector, through massive public investment and incentives aimed at stimulating the emergence of a new zero-carbon and zero-waste future. Hundreds of thousands of jobs could come with this transition, as has become evident in Germany, where leadership from the state has brought about rapid changes in the renewable energy sector. We have to make this change in any event: and if not now, then when?  Leaving the decarbonisation of the economy until after we have shored-up the old financial order won't work. Why should we expect the monster to behave differently once resuscitated? And, in any event, we don't have time to wait and see. We are already either at, or very close to, critical climatic tipping points. Continuing to load the atmosphere with carbon dioxide might give temporary relief for the old system, but it have the kind of climactic impact that will make the present crisis look like a minor inconvenience. We are set on a course toward disaster, and we need to change tack \u2013 fast. It is unfortunate, however, that many politicians seem able to only deal with one issue at a time, because right now we need a joined up programme that simultaneously hits at least three priorities at once: promoting economic recovery, avoiding the worst impacts of peak oil and cutting climate-changing emissions. It is not as if everyone now speaks with one voice in favour of the old order. Even some of the UK's largest companies have spoken out today in calling for a more joined-up strategy for tackling climate change while boosting the economy. So let's do it, because this new political project could be one of the most important in history.</p>"
